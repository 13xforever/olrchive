00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:26,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, July 21st, 2013, a long-awaited Nintendo Classic finally hits Wii U Virtual Console, a dormant franchise reemerges with a new game announcement at Comic-Con, and things get heated with one EA Sports franchise.

2
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:37,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:38,946
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:43,227
[SPEAKER_11]: This is episode number 513 July the 21st, 2013.

5
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:49,350
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about all things video gaming.

6
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,190
[SPEAKER_11]: TechMasterLoki

7
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:14,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working on a bag of three pounds of gummy bears.

8
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:18,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, you brought a lot of different stuff with you, fun things to the show tonight.

9
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:24,483
[SPEAKER_11]: One of these things you brought to the studio with you, a giant package of Haribo gummy bears.

10
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:29,747
[SPEAKER_11]: And not that I'm complaining, gummy bears are amazing, but that's three pounds.

11
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:30,388
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of...

12
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:31,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Gummy Bears!

13
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:01,366
[SPEAKER_11]: and so, you know, it kind of paid for itself.

14
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:01,926
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

15
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:05,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, gummy bears are always exciting and you know I'm going to steal some before the night is over.

16
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:13,130
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you've kind of had a busy week and before we get into our gaming weeks and all that stuff, I want to talk to you about some of the variety of things that's gone on this week.

17
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,371
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course, I do want to introduce the always present fourth guest in our show, The Chat Room.

18
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:28,815
[SPEAKER_11]: We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

19
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:54,180
[SPEAKER_11]: and uh even though Bobby's opinion on games sometimes can be very wrong uh we do still support all our indie podcast friends even when they don't agree with you that Super Metroid is the greatest game ever made I mean how how geez how can somebody not think that but diversity I suppose we have to embrace a diverse environment all right it's fine it's it's gonna be the greatest game ever made up until Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out and then you know

20
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Things might change.

21
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:59,421
[SPEAKER_11]: You are trying to pressure me into the Grand Theft Auto V. I might have to do it.

22
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:06,344
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've been taking a break from the MMOs lately because all my friends quit World of Warcraft, basically.

23
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:07,344
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I shouldn't say all.

24
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:10,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some friends that play World of Warcraft still, but very few.

25
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:16,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I signed in for the first time today in like six days and I had a bunch of friends that were like, oh my gosh, where have you been?

26
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:22,888
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've been really able to catch up on a lot of single player games like Steam and stuff like that, which I'll get into in my gaming week.

27
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:26,749
[SPEAKER_11]: But Grand Theft Auto 4 is still sitting there on the list of things I need to do.

28
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:27,529
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to play it.

29
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:29,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

30
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,650
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I do.

31
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,670
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

32
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

33
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma wants to know, are they vodka infused gummy bears?

34
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:37,151
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not yet.

35
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:40,252
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's more like heat infused gummy bears that have been sitting in my car.

36
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:42,373
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've actually seen it before.

37
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:50,157
[SPEAKER_12]: What happens if they sit in my car for a very long time, it will literally conform to the bag and it'll be just one solid mass of gummy bears.

38
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:59,102
[SPEAKER_11]: LokiLives46, I don't know if that's in reference to your name or if you just both happen to be Loki, but LokiLives46 says that's almost a gross amount of sugar, man.

39
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:09,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't eat them all in one day because it's seriously, right now it feels like I have a weight in my stomach because I finished eating dinner and then I had this.

40
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Star Trek Enterprise

41
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:35,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of those mini... It comes in, like, the plastic bag things, and, you know, it's not too difficult.

42
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:40,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I was building during Bobby's show, and I'm... Well, not the whole thing, like, last 10 minutes.

43
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm already almost done.

44
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,453
[SPEAKER_11]: But where did you get this from, and what's been going on?

45
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:48,517
[SPEAKER_12]: I got it from the Namco Bandai rep, because they came to my work this week.

46
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:52,400
[SPEAKER_12]: We do this, like, kind of a... Well, it used to be a game summit.

47
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Now it's, like, an entertainment summit, because they have a couple movie studios coming.

48
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:56,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Now there's also the...

49
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:05,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Other things that we sell as well, including Wonder Chalk, which is like this modeling chocolate stuff now.

50
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:11,160
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, so they had a bunch of game companies out and stuff, and they show us what's coming out.

51
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:16,783
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to see a few different... I mean, we'll talk about some of this stuff in Game Week, I guess.

52
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:18,184
[SPEAKER_12]: But I got to see a few different things.

53
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:21,664
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a few guys that brought dev kits with them.

54
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:26,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Ubisoft brought Splinter Cell Blacklist, so I got to play a little of that.

55
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:31,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Takuma Koei, they brought... What was it?

56
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:35,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z, so I got to play the E3 demo of that.

57
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:41,770
[SPEAKER_12]: And I didn't actually play it, but Activision brought Skylanders Swap Force...

58
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:48,053
[SPEAKER_12]: I did follow the toys a little bit because there was no one at the booth at the time.

59
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:52,715
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was looking at them and the top and bottom halves are held together with magnets.

60
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:55,156
[SPEAKER_12]: As you would expect, I guess.

61
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:57,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Magnets, how do they work?

62
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,721
[SPEAKER_12]: I was very disappointed that Disney did not bring their Disney Infinity stuff.

63
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,821
[SPEAKER_12]: They only had a video, which I've already seen.

64
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:10,403
[SPEAKER_11]: And what else?

65
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:16,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's neat that they were able to bring stuff to your work at all because there's other game stuff going on right now.

66
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:18,586
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of stuff going on at Comic Con.

67
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,807
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems even more gaming news this year than usual.

68
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,708
[SPEAKER_11]: And then PAX Australia, which...

69
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Oddly, haven't been hearing a lot coming out of PAX Australia.

70
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:46,318
[SPEAKER_11]: There hasn't really been a lot of news broken at PAX Australia, but I'm sure it's been really cool for them to just experience PAX.

71
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:51,041
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, getting all the nerds in one place and the big gaming rooms and all that.

72
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:54,203
[SPEAKER_12]: But my favorite part, see, about the whole thing was actually something that didn't even take place.

73
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:58,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it took place at the event, but more of the after event, like the dinner.

74
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:01,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so I have a couple reps that work at different companies.

75
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:05,551
[SPEAKER_12]: One guy, my friend Daniel, he's worked at a bunch of different companies.

76
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I've known him since he's worked at...

77
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:25,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Konami, Namco, D3, he's working at D3 now and then there's also Len who actually he owns a company now he owns Maximum Games Maximum Family Games they do a lot of like you know family product and

78
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:26,902
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

79
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:53,691
[SPEAKER_12]: A long time ago, like back when they were launching the Genesis, you know, a long time ago and stuff.

80
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,072
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they were telling me so many stories.

81
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:57,673
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just fantastic.

82
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:15,843
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, Leonard was telling me stories about how, because he, you know, since he owns the company and stuff, they deal a lot with, you know, shipping to Brazil and stuff and about all the difficulties with that and how you get product in there and stuff and how you have to, you know, almost like bribe officials and stuff to get things in there is crazy.

83
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:15,983
[SPEAKER_12]: But

84
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:18,805
[SPEAKER_12]: The stories from Sega were great.

85
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:32,275
[SPEAKER_12]: They were talking about how they came up with... I guess they announced the core system for the Sega Genesis at... Not E3, CES one of these years or something.

86
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:36,878
[SPEAKER_12]: They were telling... I guess everyone was saying, oh, that's a brilliant idea and stuff.

87
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:41,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it was the first time that they had ever come out with a game system that was actually called a core system.

88
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:42,122
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of...

89
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:44,884
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

90
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:10,940
[SPEAKER_12]: They were asking them, so what do you guys think about the 32X?

91
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:19,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think this is going to be something that's going to work for consumers and stuff and how they're saying it's such a bad idea and everything?

92
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:21,568
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

93
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,230
[SPEAKER_12]: It just sounded like a lot of fun.

94
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:35,220
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I could have got the guys on the show to talk about that kind of stuff, but obviously they don't want a lot of the stuff coming back verbatim because some people would get butthurt about that kind of stuff.

95
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

96
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, total derailment here, but you're in the background of my vine.

97
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I still post that?

98
00:09:39,354 --> 00:09:39,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I don't care.

99
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:40,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Just making sure.

100
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:46,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I always ask permission before I post people's face on the internet, but I wanted to show off my Lego Enterprise because I finished.

101
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:46,958
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

102
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:55,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm glad you got to reminisce with people and old friends that have moved from company to company and catch up on some of the drums, right?

103
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's fun.

104
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:05,179
[SPEAKER_12]: And then also, my other guy, my other friend from, I guess, it's not really a publisher, but he's a rep firm.

105
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,043
[SPEAKER_12]: He works with...

106
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:10,455
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, what is it now?

107
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:11,655
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Watten Company.

108
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:13,336
[SPEAKER_12]: He works with them.

109
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,757
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

110
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:17,999
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of these guys I've seen for a long time because they've been here every single year.

111
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,800
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a few reps that cycle through and stuff.

112
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I did get to meet with Microsoft.

113
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:24,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God.

114
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:25,183
[SPEAKER_12]: I swear to God.

115
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:32,507
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing you'll learn about Microsoft if you're in the industry and stuff and if you actually get face-to-face contact with some of these reps...

116
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:36,212
[SPEAKER_12]: They're different than everybody else.

117
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:41,399
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll talk to them and you get this vibe from them.

118
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,745
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just very much the Microsoft way of doing things.

119
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,367
[SPEAKER_12]: For example...

120
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:58,996
[SPEAKER_12]: We were actually sitting down and having lunch, and my coworkers started asking him questions about the Xbox One and all the critical stuff about the Xbox One and stuff.

121
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:04,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And just listening to the guy spin stuff, I mean, obviously, he's kind of along the lines with how we're thinking.

122
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:16,107
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really early, and a lot of this stuff is going to change, so he can't really say too much about what it's going to be in the final product, considering that they can just...

123
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:21,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Turnaround, but just like such the, well, we were listening to the consumers and blah, blah, blah.

124
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:26,353
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, I set up items for our company.

125
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I set up items, and I don't have any of the first-party setup information.

126
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:34,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So I asked Microsoft, hey, can you provide me a list of the UPCs for the stuff that you have coming out?

127
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:40,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we're sorry, because you see, you guys don't really buy direct from us, so you're going to have to ask somebody else.

128
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,801
[SPEAKER_12]: What the fuck?

129
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:44,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, but we're supporting you guys.

130
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:45,843
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we're out here today.

131
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:46,663
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

132
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:49,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, fine.

133
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:52,827
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't give me stuff to set up the items in our system so that we can sell your product.

134
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:56,910
[SPEAKER_12]: I just won't bother pushing for that since... Was this not sell your product then?

135
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:57,810
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

136
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:00,552
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole thing's a corporate script, Loki.

137
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:01,473
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ridiculous.

138
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:07,377
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the weird thing at E3, too, is that there was just such the corporate script that nobody was going to deviate from.

139
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:10,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, everything benefits them.

140
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:15,480
[SPEAKER_12]: They say they're thinking about the consumer, but it's always what's going to benefit Microsoft.

141
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,660
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what it comes down to.

142
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's everything that I've talked to them and listening to their spiel and stuff like that.

143
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,883
[SPEAKER_12]: And this isn't something new.

144
00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:26,924
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been around since the first year of Microsoft.

145
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:31,566
[SPEAKER_12]: It's never about, like, here's the upcoming games we have and stuff like that.

146
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,467
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys need to sell more of our accessories.

147
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:36,105
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to sell more.

148
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:39,546
[SPEAKER_12]: This is how you should be upselling these games.

149
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:43,788
[SPEAKER_12]: When someone orders a Halo 4, you should ask them, do you want a year of live with that too?

150
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:47,109
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, dude, first off, I'm not selling retail for one.

151
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:53,291
[SPEAKER_12]: And two, my customers order live cards when they need them and stuff.

152
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:54,992
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't need to be pushed for that stuff.

153
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:56,952
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember the first year.

154
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,193
[SPEAKER_12]: This is when the Xbox 360 launched.

155
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:19,703
[SPEAKER_12]: our guy who is actually higher up now he's like yeah you guys need to be selling you need to be pushing the accessories cool but you're not shipping any to us because they're allocated we want to order them we're trying to sell them but you're not shipping any and now you're telling us that we need to push them but we can't because you're not shipping any to us

156
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,450
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hilarious.

157
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:25,213
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like banging your head against the wall.

158
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:28,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, it's the line.

159
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:31,238
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the stuff they're trying to sell and push.

160
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:34,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony on the other end, I must add, asks them the same thing.

161
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I need setup information for your UPCs.

162
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:38,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Guy gives me his card.

163
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:40,825
[SPEAKER_12]: He says, send me an email and I'll get you the information you need.

164
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:42,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Was that so fucking hard?

165
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:42,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And guess what?

166
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,407
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't buy direct from them either, so...

167
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:46,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect example.

168
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:52,130
[SPEAKER_12]: It shouldn't be that difficult to get information from them to sell their product.

169
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:52,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

170
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:54,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Jamie.

171
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:54,810
[SPEAKER_07]: What he just said.

172
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

173
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, welcome to the show.

174
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,190
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

175
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopeful.

176
00:13:58,811 --> 00:13:59,751
[SPEAKER_11]: You smell like sandwich.

177
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you bring a sandwich?

178
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:01,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought Panda.

179
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:02,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

180
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:02,932
[SPEAKER_11]: You were so wrong.

181
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:03,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't eaten all day.

182
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:04,472
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

183
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:05,032
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

184
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:05,612
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

185
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:11,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, one other thing I want to ask you about, especially now that DarkSakura's here to hear this, the Ouya thing you've been tweeting about.

186
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:11,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

187
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:12,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, come on.

188
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,474
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with the Ouya stuff?

189
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:19,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so since I've gotten my Ouya, I don't even know if you've noticed on that controller that since you're borrowing the system now...

190
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:22,197
[SPEAKER_12]: The analog sticks are fucked up.

191
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:47,714
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it was a defect.

192
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:50,497
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a defect that was in the first run of those controllers.

193
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:55,962
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's something that's documented, and it's something I tested, and I saw the same thing that they came up with.

194
00:14:56,502 --> 00:15:02,848
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've been trying to get it replaced recently, because I know they've been busy with the launch and stuff, and it's just getting a hold of customer service.

195
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:09,355
[SPEAKER_12]: I started my claim, or I should say my support ticket, back in June, on the 25th.

196
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:16,177
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first response I got from them was kind of a canned response.

197
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:18,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Because everyone's asking, you know, where's my Ouya system?

198
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:25,309
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was all this information about, you know, when your Ouya system's coming and how to track it and all that stuff.

199
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:25,930
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, well...

200
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:28,192
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

201
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,302
[SPEAKER_12]: I keep responding back to the thread.

202
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:48,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, hey, where do we go from here?

203
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:49,526
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going on here?

204
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:52,009
[SPEAKER_12]: And so then finally I get a response back.

205
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:59,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Your replacement faceplates have been sent out because I guess there's some problem with some of the faceplates and so people are requesting the faceplates.

206
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:01,308
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

207
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,000
[SPEAKER_11]: E.A.'

208
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,321
[SPEAKER_11]: 's does that

209
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:42,979
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying, so it took me filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, which they already have, you know, looks like a few complaints against them already.

210
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,404
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not part of the Better Business Bureau yet.

211
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:50,566
[SPEAKER_12]: And that didn't really do anything.

212
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:53,348
[SPEAKER_12]: So then I had to complain on Facebook or Twitter.

213
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:59,153
[SPEAKER_12]: And so finally got the attention of their community manager.

214
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:01,135
[SPEAKER_12]: And she kind of got the ball rolling a little bit.

215
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:03,357
[SPEAKER_12]: And I finally got another response saying that I was supposed to be

216
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:06,439
[SPEAKER_12]: He's forwarding my thing to the RMA department.

217
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:09,101
[SPEAKER_12]: So still, I don't have a fixed controller.

218
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, literally, I could have gone out to the store.

219
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:22,271
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the right way to do it, but I could have gone to the store, bought a brand new Ouya controller, and took it back, took my old controller back as defective, and got my money back, and could have had it replaced weeks ago.

220
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,814
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I wanted to do it through the proper channels.

221
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:29,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, if I get dicked around for another couple weeks, I am going to do that.

222
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,258
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's where I'm at.

223
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:32,559
[SPEAKER_12]: I still don't have a fixed controller yet.

224
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:35,940
[SPEAKER_12]: What a mess.

225
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:36,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

226
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:38,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Customer service is so important.

227
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:41,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Their customer service is absolutely terrible.

228
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:44,268
[SPEAKER_12]: And this goes just the full gamut.

229
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:46,690
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not been good at all.

230
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:49,193
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I understand that they're a new company, but come on, man.

231
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,656
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been dealing with customer service issues for the last three months now.

232
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,259
[SPEAKER_12]: They should be a little bit more on top of it.

233
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:55,539
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean...

234
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Just even getting back to people in a timely manner.

235
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:01,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Or reading the email.

236
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:06,768
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're going to respond back to somebody, read through what the whole problem is.

237
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:10,831
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're saying, oh, I'm going to send you replacement faceplates, that's not going to fucking fix the problem.

238
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:12,292
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

239
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:14,274
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just strange.

240
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:15,094
[SPEAKER_12]: But...

241
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:20,437
[SPEAKER_12]: And now they've got some more news about what they're trying to do to drive up sales and stuff.

242
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:27,922
[SPEAKER_12]: And even their response to the NPD numbers this month, they're saying, oh yeah, the Ouya launch hasn't been very successful because they haven't sold that many units.

243
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,503
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're like, well, we sold out of all of our units.

244
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:30,723
[SPEAKER_12]: We're chasing demand right now.

245
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because your manufacturing is so fucking slow.

246
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:34,966
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know.

247
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:38,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just kind of over that system already.

248
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:41,910
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of felt like it was a whole mistake to back it in the first place.

249
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Dan said he wanted one now.

250
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:46,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, no, we're not getting one.

251
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:48,655
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm putting my foot down.

252
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:50,556
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not terrible.

253
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's going to get better because it's just a system right now.

254
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:58,379
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all up to the developers and what they're coming out with and stuff.

255
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:02,700
[SPEAKER_12]: And they even had some stuff that came out of their little game jam thing that they did that looked really cool.

256
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,541
[SPEAKER_12]: But not a lot of it's actually been made yet.

257
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:08,082
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a game called Television that I wanted to play.

258
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:09,143
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of this weird...

259
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:12,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

260
00:19:29,774 --> 00:19:33,256
[SPEAKER_12]: and hell, it can't even access, you know, external storage devices yet.

261
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:34,737
[SPEAKER_12]: None of that stuff's happened.

262
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:40,840
[SPEAKER_12]: It can't, you know, it doesn't have any sort of online multiplayer.

263
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,883
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no, like, any, you know, sharing of, like, there's no friends-less things built into it.

264
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:46,463
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing.

265
00:19:46,523 --> 00:19:49,345
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just very rushed, I guess.

266
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,121
[SPEAKER_11]: WhatUpG asks in chat, who has great customer service?

267
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:56,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I can think of a few companies.

268
00:19:58,123 --> 00:20:01,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say my car insurance company, AAA, has always been really good to me.

269
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't really complain about them at all.

270
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:07,089
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say the masters of customer service.

271
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:08,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen anyone do it better.

272
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:08,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Disney.

273
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:09,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Disneyland.

274
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:14,595
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm saying as far as game industry, I actually had really good customer service with Blizzard.

275
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:14,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

276
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:18,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a few times I've had to call.

277
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:18,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I had really good service.

278
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:27,502
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like how long I've had to wait in some of the hold times, but once you get through to somebody, yeah, my experiences with Blizzard has been good.

279
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:29,123
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't complain.

280
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:38,247
[SPEAKER_12]: The best, or one of the best, is supposed to be Zappos, but I've never really ordered from them, although I've met the people at the company, and they're all really great.

281
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:39,308
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all shoes, right?

282
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Their shoes and clothing and stuff, they did get into electronics for a while.

283
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:46,334
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually sold them games for a little bit, but they're really great.

284
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:48,876
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, just everybody there is fantastic.

285
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:51,298
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a very unique corporate culture, too.

286
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:51,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

287
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:52,258
[SPEAKER_11]: It really works for them.

288
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:53,139
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really cool.

289
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,182
[SPEAKER_12]: None of the executives have offices there.

290
00:20:56,262 --> 00:20:59,564
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all down there in cubicles with everybody, and it's just very...

291
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:04,787
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good morale, and just everybody is really happy to work there, and I think that's how you do it.

292
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:08,208
[SPEAKER_12]: You keep people happy, and they will be happy.

293
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:11,529
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if they're pissed off at their job, they're not going to be happy to your customers.

294
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:16,570
[SPEAKER_07]: The place that I just got hired for believes the same thing, and everyone looks super happy there.

295
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say where I got hired, but still.

296
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:23,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Technus in chat says, Costco has amazing customer service, returns with no question asked.

297
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:26,587
[SPEAKER_11]: They changed some of that policy lately.

298
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:32,208
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think they still probably have the most liberal return policy in most companies, but it's not as crazy as it used to be.

299
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiger Claw asks, Rob, you're a corporate trainer.

300
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you teach customer service?

301
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I did for seven years.

302
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:46,151
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously, just due to separating my day job and my hobby, I'm not going to tell you where I work or much more than that.

303
00:21:46,671 --> 00:22:13,916
[SPEAKER_11]: but yes I taught customer service for seven years and I actually still even though I am still a corporate trainer I teach something else I sometimes teach customer service elements and I still write some manuals relating to that but so that's why it's important to me and I think you know a lot of companies I hate it when they let it go because one of the biggest things about customer service is just having to have the mentality like I want to do good things

304
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:16,638
[SPEAKER_11]: That's 90% of it right there.

305
00:22:17,238 --> 00:22:20,821
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, I won't get into too much more than that.

306
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:23,763
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people in chat saying Amazon.

307
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:26,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma saying Newegg is great customer service.

308
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:28,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Bonds006 says, how can I forget Nintendo?

309
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:29,648
[SPEAKER_11]: They have yet to let me down.

310
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:34,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've worked in customer service for a solid eight years.

311
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:38,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So trust me, when you're in it, you know what not to do.

312
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:38,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

313
00:22:39,756 --> 00:22:40,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I've called people out on stuff.

314
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:48,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I've actually, when I get good phone service, which I can't remember the last company I got it from.

315
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:51,279
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just been, I don't actually call places a whole lot.

316
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of prefer to do interactions online myself.

317
00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:00,441
[SPEAKER_11]: But the last time I called somebody, I got such good customer service, I actually said, can I talk to your manager and leave a compliment?

318
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:01,602
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I usually do?

319
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:03,142
[SPEAKER_11]: They love that.

320
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:04,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, you know what's even better?

321
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:08,255
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like someone's job, ask for the fax number, fax them a letter.

322
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:17,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when I worked in customer service before, verbal compliments were really good, but written compliments were like the gold star.

323
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,700
[SPEAKER_07]: They were the diamond star.

324
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,824
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're willing to do that, not waste your time, spend your time doing something like that.

325
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:26,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I got 14 of them in one year.

326
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:29,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I got taken out to dinner five times.

327
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:30,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Little this show off.

328
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:33,650
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was that one year that we were so super busy and I worked all that overtime.

329
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:40,034
[SPEAKER_07]: But I actually just sort of gave up on the call time and ended up helping out whoever it was because it was really freaking busy.

330
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:42,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's one thing when you have 255 calls in queue.

331
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:43,516
[SPEAKER_07]: When your queue max is 255.

332
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:43,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

333
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:43,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

334
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I don't know how we got on that tangent.

335
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:50,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, OUYA stuff.

336
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:56,461
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, anything else about your antics this week you want to share with us, Loki, before we get into Gaming Weeks?

337
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:57,642
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much it.

338
00:23:57,742 --> 00:24:02,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get into how was your Gaming Week and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.

339
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:03,287
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

340
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:04,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Crossing.

341
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:05,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Still?

342
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:05,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

343
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Is my DS around?

344
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:08,252
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta make sure our 3DS is mate.

345
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:10,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned mine on.

346
00:24:11,054 --> 00:24:11,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine's been on all day.

347
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:15,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, when I went to South Sac yesterday, I street passed two people there.

348
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:20,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea who, but there were two people in South Sac, so if you're listening, I street passed you totally.

349
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:26,445
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, yeah, I actually, let's see, I've just expanded my second room.

350
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:32,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've expanded my upstairs, I've expanded my house twice, the upstairs once, and

351
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,712
[SPEAKER_07]: My side room once, my other side room once, and I'm going to be expanding my basement.

352
00:24:37,732 --> 00:24:39,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like 56,000 bills left.

353
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyone who wants a tip, fish on the island.

354
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:45,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Fish on the island, cat sharks.

355
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:48,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw everything back if they're not a shark.

356
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard beetles on the island.

357
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:51,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, some of the Beatles, not all of them.

358
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,737
[SPEAKER_07]: The Goliath ones are worth some money.

359
00:24:55,437 --> 00:24:58,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And I finished Little Inferno.

360
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:00,298
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is weird.

361
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:02,799
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the one where you set things on fire, right?

362
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:03,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I love that game.

363
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:04,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

364
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really about it because I've been job interviewing.

365
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been shopping for professional clothes.

366
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:12,441
[SPEAKER_11]: But congrats, you got the job.

367
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:15,122
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know you don't want to say, well, you'll tell me all about it off air, but...

368
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:15,804
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

369
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what a positive time between that and the house stuff.

370
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:46,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we found two really good houses today, and we put out an offer on one of them today.

371
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:47,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

372
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:50,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And a little two-bedroom house, but we have a big office in it.

373
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:52,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Fingers and toes crossed.

374
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:53,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And my own bathroom.

375
00:25:54,517 --> 00:25:54,797
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

376
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:55,978
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

377
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:57,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the one out, I guess I can say Antelope?

378
00:25:57,918 --> 00:25:58,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that the one in Antelope?

379
00:25:58,518 --> 00:25:59,078
[SPEAKER_11]: In Antelope.

380
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,139
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be a bit of a drive.

381
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,800
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be a schlep, but it'd be a watt to 50 for me to get to work.

382
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,360
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not bad.

383
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,345
[SPEAKER_11]: E3 demo for Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z

384
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:20,884
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

385
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:54,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and said somehow it let me kill the zombie and then I couldn't finish the demo, which is kind of funny, but I've already seen how it ends.

386
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,350
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it wasn't that big deal.

387
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:06,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and then I played a bit of a Splinter Cell Conviction, which honestly I have, um, or not conviction, Splinter Cell Blacklist.

388
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,656
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a new one.

389
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:08,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Um,

390
00:27:10,518 --> 00:27:10,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

391
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:29,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

392
00:27:48,715 --> 00:27:49,135
[SPEAKER_12]: And what else?

393
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:51,036
[SPEAKER_12]: I played more Super Meat Boy.

394
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:56,818
[SPEAKER_12]: I pretty much got all the A-pluses for the first level.

395
00:27:57,478 --> 00:28:00,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm working on the second level, and that includes both Dark and Light worlds.

396
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,341
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got all of the bandages.

397
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:09,083
[SPEAKER_12]: So now I have... Who did I unlock?

398
00:28:09,363 --> 00:28:13,004
[SPEAKER_12]: I unlocked the robot from Macarium, I think.

399
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:14,445
[SPEAKER_12]: And then also...

400
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:21,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, what's his name from, um... I don't even remember now who it was.

401
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:23,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a bunch of other characters.

402
00:28:23,422 --> 00:28:25,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the alien from Alien Hominid.

403
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:26,709
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um...

404
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Some other character.

405
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:30,217
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know who it is.

406
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:31,398
[SPEAKER_12]: It's from some other indie game.

407
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:38,202
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to get the guy from Minecraft because he has the coolest kind of special attack.

408
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:39,743
[SPEAKER_12]: You can actually dig through the level.

409
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:46,767
[SPEAKER_11]: ShadowNextGen in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Loki, the mark and shoot mechanic was also in Splinter Cell Conviction.

410
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:47,427
[SPEAKER_11]: You should check it out.

411
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:48,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

412
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:59,386
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, before the show, I got sent the beta for Mercenary Kings, which is a game I backed on Kickstarter.

413
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:01,667
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's awesome.

414
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:09,069
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks very much like a metal slug, but it's not.

415
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:12,871
[SPEAKER_12]: You can craft weapons in the game because you collect things.

416
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:18,292
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really hard and all really awesome hand-drawn pixel art.

417
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:19,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

418
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:21,867
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

419
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,830
[SPEAKER_12]: I played it for about 15 minutes and it was pretty sweet.

420
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,253
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just I never finished the first level because I had no fucking clue where I was supposed to be going.

421
00:29:28,273 --> 00:29:33,457
[SPEAKER_12]: I was supposed to be rescuing one guy and I went all through the level because it kind of plays a little Metroidvania, I guess.

422
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:44,487
[SPEAKER_12]: They're very open levels, but since I have no map or don't know where I'm supposed to be going, I kind of wandered the level for a while and couldn't find who I was supposed to be rescuing because you have a time limit.

423
00:29:45,568 --> 00:29:45,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

424
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:47,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Shadowrun Returns

425
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:05,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to check on Shadowgate returns.

426
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I backed that kickstart.

427
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,789
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only backed like two maybe.

428
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:09,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, no.

429
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:13,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there were the two recently because we had them both on the network that I backed.

430
00:30:13,692 --> 00:30:20,397
[SPEAKER_11]: But then there was also, you know, I'm starting to see the rewards for GamerCon, or as they call it, GamerX, is next weekend.

431
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:22,399
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like actually happening, which is pretty cool.

432
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:25,481
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just financing the reaping the rewards of that.

433
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:31,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Shadowgate was the only other thing I've ever kickstarted outside of the Professor Shy Guy thing.

434
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:43,353
[SPEAKER_12]: so I'm still waiting for that to come out which I think is later this year so I'm excited about that yeah so um I think that's all I played this week I didn't I wanted to play some other stuff I installed a few games um

435
00:30:45,402 --> 00:30:46,242
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, that's it.

436
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:50,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Although there's going to be lots of taking up of time, so I don't know if I'll get into a lot of these games.

437
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:55,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Saints Row the Third, still have a few achievements left I need to get.

438
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:56,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

439
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:58,308
[SPEAKER_11]: So my gaming week.

440
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:01,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I've played quite a bit of different things, just kind of like a potpourri of stuff.

441
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,912
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think not playing MMOs right now because I'm kind of holding out.

442
00:31:06,012 --> 00:31:14,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn is going to be the next big thing I get sucked into, but it's not really out until mid-August, whenever the early launch and the next beta phase happen and all that.

443
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,897
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm kind of in this lull right now.

444
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:20,698
[SPEAKER_11]: World of Warcraft, most of my friends are on hiatus.

445
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:24,619
[SPEAKER_11]: They've either just gone off to play other things or they're going to play XIV or they quit or whatever.

446
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:26,840
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just not a lot of people still playing WoW.

447
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,861
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just a couple people I still run into, but not a lot.

448
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:35,923
[SPEAKER_11]: So I sign into WoW maybe once every few days, play a PvP Battleground, try to talk to people, but that's about it.

449
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:38,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've been using this time to kind of catch up on single player things.

450
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:42,004
[SPEAKER_11]: And Steam sale obviously has been a huge contributor to that.

451
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:44,185
[SPEAKER_11]: The trading card metagame.

452
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:47,485
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually did my badge today for the summer sale.

453
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,886
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got my summer sale badge and it gave me a friends list boost to five people.

454
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:52,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Not everybody would get that.

455
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,547
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just I think you get like a random loot.

456
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got a background for my profile.

457
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:00,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So now when you go visit my profile on Steam, which is I think GreenSky42 is my external name.

458
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:05,189
[SPEAKER_11]: You can actually see like my little trading card backgrounds, you know, just silly thing.

459
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,630
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, there was that.

460
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to that, I kind of was playing some more games on Steam.

461
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:19,094
[SPEAKER_11]: A few things to note, Skyrim, I started randomly playing the other night because, you know, Skyrim is that game you can just get sucked into.

462
00:32:19,134 --> 00:32:20,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, cards, partially cards.

463
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:22,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I got all of my cards in one sitting.

464
00:32:22,596 --> 00:32:25,737
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll tell you how I got sucked into Skyrim one night, right?

465
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:26,998
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's that.

466
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:29,799
[SPEAKER_11]: But then the other game I got really sucked into, Torchlight 2.

467
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:34,482
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought it I didn't play it, but I bought it

468
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:54,300
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

469
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:11,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

470
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:19,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of live streaming, after the show last week, Shane made me play Slender the Eight Pages and do a live stream.

471
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

472
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,461
[SPEAKER_11]: That game was scary.

473
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:24,841
[SPEAKER_11]: But I beat his score.

474
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:26,842
[SPEAKER_11]: He's only gone as far as two pages.

475
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:29,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to three pages by sheer dumb luck.

476
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:38,608
[SPEAKER_11]: and I live streamed the whole thing and I had the lights out so like all you could see is my silhouette and the lights from Alan's computer because I had like my little webcam in the corner.

477
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:46,753
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all in the archive on my channel at Twitch TV Rob Roberts and I did have a jump scream where I literally screamed once.

478
00:33:47,373 --> 00:34:11,831
[SPEAKER_11]: and uh Shay I just he started laughing and then I bust up laughing it was really funny but it was scary like I was in this like bathroom area looking for a page and I turned the corner and he was right there and the music did the bong and like the tentacles were coming out and everything it was like ah so I let out this big screech so that was fun uh even though you know I probably won't play that again anytime soon but that was that was a good thrill for that

479
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:13,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy VII Final Fantasy VII

480
00:34:39,901 --> 00:35:02,677
[SPEAKER_11]: but the whole cloud saving feature is busted and I don't know if it's just because so many people bought it when it went on the flash sale yesterday but like I could not save my game yesterday that's very frustrating and stupid like if the cloud thing doesn't work the game should still let you save locally by default but I could not say and I streamed this whole thing happening I couldn't save to a local file that's ridiculous come on

481
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:10,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize that Square's trying to tie everything together online to do the boost level thing and everything, but it's ridiculous.

482
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:14,347
[SPEAKER_12]: It should always save locally and then to the cloud.

483
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:15,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, right?

484
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:21,073
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to really dog Final Fantasy VII for that cloud-saving thing because it does more harm than good in this case.

485
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:24,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping they fix it, but it did not leave a good impression.

486
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:28,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wants to replay the first hour of the game again?

487
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, well...

488
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:31,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I did play it for the first time.

489
00:35:32,003 --> 00:35:33,644
[SPEAKER_11]: But like the first time in a few years.

490
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the first time since yesterday.

491
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:43,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Jason in our chatroom, VXJasonXV at live.vognetwork.com says, Cloud can't save Aeris.

492
00:35:43,332 --> 00:35:44,713
[SPEAKER_11]: You expect him to save your game?

493
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:46,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Lol.

494
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:47,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope.

495
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:49,397
[SPEAKER_07]: My cloud would have stabbed her.

496
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:53,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

497
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:54,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also looking here.

498
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,587
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw says Rob needs to play more scary games on Twitch.

499
00:35:58,168 --> 00:35:58,968
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a possibility.

500
00:35:59,008 --> 00:35:59,709
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a possibility.

501
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:01,410
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to play a variety of things.

502
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Just sometimes classic things.

503
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Too bad you don't have the Oculus Rift and then play like a Slender game.

504
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:06,313
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

505
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,974
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, by the way, Rob?

506
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:11,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I did remember one other video game related thing we did last night.

507
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,677
[SPEAKER_07]: We watched the live stream of Video Games Live.

508
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:16,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I saw part of that.

509
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:20,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I decided to stream at the same time it was on, which is probably why nobody was watching.

510
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:21,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm amused by David Hader's ponytail.

511
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:29,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember what I used because my computer I had to format the hard drive so I don't have my program anymore

512
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:53,836
[SPEAKER_11]: FFSplit, I did not get as good a performance out of that as I did.

513
00:36:53,956 --> 00:37:01,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's nice because that's free and everything, but I got a better performance out of OBS.

514
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:01,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

515
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:11,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Also trying to read through our chat room real quick at live.vognetwork.com I guess that's it for now for chat comments, but we'll get some more of these later.

516
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:13,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks commenting on a story that's coming up.

517
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:37,595
[SPEAKER_11]: but I think I got everything in my gaming week oh one other thing I should throw out there on the Wii U this week and I'm spoiling the news a little bit but it's my own story Earthbound was out on the Wii U this week I played a bit of that on virtual console it's nice to revisit that game after a very long time I played it on emulators once like years ago but to be able to like play it again on the TV and on the little gamepad is is a nice experience it's

518
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:40,056
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a great, great RPG.

519
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:41,116
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my all-time favorites.

520
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:41,717
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is.

521
00:37:41,797 --> 00:37:52,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I know Bobby's been razzing me a little bit about the whole Super Metroid versus EarthBound thing, but I'm always kind of like, but EarthBound really is like a really good game, and I don't find EarthBound to be overrated.

522
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:55,523
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not my favorite game, but it's probably in my top five.

523
00:37:55,603 --> 00:37:56,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I love EarthBound.

524
00:37:56,723 --> 00:37:57,123
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

525
00:37:57,684 --> 00:37:57,824
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

526
00:37:58,544 --> 00:37:59,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Glad to be playing that again.

527
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:02,005
[SPEAKER_11]: And glad to hear they didn't really change a lot.

528
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:04,266
[SPEAKER_11]: The changes they made, very minor stuff.

529
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:08,428
[SPEAKER_11]: They made one dialogue change, and I don't even think it was that big a deal.

530
00:38:08,528 --> 00:38:14,810
[SPEAKER_11]: And they changed some of the graphic effects to tone down the amazing seizure displays that some of the side effects have.

531
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,591
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean the embryos?

532
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:16,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm?

533
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:17,291
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean the embryos?

534
00:38:17,451 --> 00:38:18,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right?

535
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:21,113
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, good times.

536
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:24,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so that's it for our gaming weeks.

537
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:32,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Quick housekeeping, twitter.com slash orange, excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR or facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to follow us.

538
00:38:33,242 --> 00:38:38,566
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, do support the other shows we have at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

539
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:42,589
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not, and this is going to be news to you guys, so sorry to spring this on you mid-show.

540
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:46,932
[SPEAKER_11]: We will not be here in two weeks because I'm going to be at that convention in San Francisco.

541
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:47,793
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be back in time.

542
00:38:48,353 --> 00:38:50,335
[SPEAKER_11]: So, because Sunday's the last day, so.

543
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:50,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

544
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:51,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

545
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:52,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about it.

546
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:54,519
[SPEAKER_11]: No show in two weeks.

547
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:55,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Surprise.

548
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:08,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe I don't keep that flexible because maybe I'll be back early enough or we can do something a little later or something, but I just... I totally want to take over the stream and do a fuck-off show.

549
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:10,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, do whatever you want.

550
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:11,514
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Jamie Rants.

551
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:12,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do a live stream.

552
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:14,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki can play Borderlands whenever.

553
00:39:15,177 --> 00:39:15,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not playing Borderlands.

554
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:16,579
[SPEAKER_11]: GameBooey

555
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:45,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Game Bar, and more.

556
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Special surprise guest, hopefully.

557
00:39:47,924 --> 00:39:57,687
[SPEAKER_11]: All talking about podcasting and kind of our own shows and trying to enable other people to do their own shows and enable more broadcasters.

558
00:39:58,267 --> 00:40:04,169
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a GLBT-focused convention, obviously, but we're really about everybody having a voice.

559
00:40:04,509 --> 00:40:04,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

560
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get into some news.

561
00:40:11,032 --> 00:40:11,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

562
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:12,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

563
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:13,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon Rumble.

564
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:23,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually kind of surprised that this is coming out still digitally, but Pokemon Rumble was a game that came out in Japan, I think earlier last year, maybe this year.

565
00:40:25,538 --> 00:40:30,101
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a digital download for the Wii U, and what makes it kind of unique is it...

566
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:38,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of going the Skylanders route where you have these physical figurines that you buy for a certain amount of money.

567
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:51,007
[SPEAKER_12]: And you, I think you put them on, I don't know if it's, I want to say it was the near field communication part of the Wii U tablet or the game pad or whatever.

568
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:52,689
[SPEAKER_12]: And it interacted with that.

569
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:56,451
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is coming out over here in North America, August 29th.

570
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:19,809
[SPEAKER_12]: 18 figurines however they are sold exclusively at Evil G so if you watch your Pokemon you know Nintendo has still made this blood pack with Evil G to do that the game I guess is 18 bucks in the eShop each figurine is going to be $4 I don't know

571
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:23,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Neat.

572
00:41:24,746 --> 00:41:26,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, why not?

573
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:32,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for the fact that it's a GameStop exclusive, but something to hold us over until X and Y, right?

574
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:35,413
[SPEAKER_12]: Europe is also going to be getting the game August 15th.

575
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:40,516
[SPEAKER_12]: No words on how they're going to, if that's going to be done through GameStop in Europe as well.

576
00:41:40,837 --> 00:41:41,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

577
00:41:43,016 --> 00:41:43,717
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of lame.

578
00:41:43,797 --> 00:41:44,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

579
00:41:44,117 --> 00:41:52,223
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't understand why they're making... I mean, I understand they're a big company, but why exclusive through GameStop to do this stuff?

580
00:41:53,604 --> 00:41:54,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why they would do that.

581
00:41:54,885 --> 00:41:59,108
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, because honestly, I think everybody could sell those stupid figurines.

582
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:00,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell, they put out the game as like a disc.

583
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,591
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm surprised they didn't do that in the first place.

584
00:42:02,611 --> 00:42:03,611
[SPEAKER_12]: $20 game, you know?

585
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:06,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Luigi U's on disc, right?

586
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:07,169
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be.

587
00:42:29,987 --> 00:42:37,331
[SPEAKER_11]: which sadly makes sense because Nintendo's trying to push people to the Wii U and there are people crazy enough to buy a Wii U to play EarthBound.

588
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:38,491
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't play it at my house.

589
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially considering how much those cartridges go for on eBay.

590
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I won't tell you how cheap we got ours.

591
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you might have got lucky too.

592
00:42:46,295 --> 00:42:48,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you find it at a... It was a long time ago.

593
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:49,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

594
00:42:49,857 --> 00:42:51,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Before the value... Probably when we had the video game store.

595
00:42:52,538 --> 00:42:52,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

596
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:56,414
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, this is out.

597
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:58,457
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a special Nintendo Direct to go with it.

598
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:05,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people taking surprise at the increased price because the game is $9.99 on the Wii U eShop.

599
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:08,491
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not the normal, I'm using my quotey fingers, price of $7.99.

600
00:43:09,993 --> 00:43:14,319
[SPEAKER_11]: But to be honest, this isn't the first time we've seen a game priced higher than the bar.

601
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:23,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe Mario 2 loss levels, or just Super Mario 2, the Japanese version, was a dollar more than most NES games.

602
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:26,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Because on the Wii, they did this whole week of...

603
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:28,958
[SPEAKER_11]: and import releases.

604
00:43:29,178 --> 00:43:32,181
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, Mario 2 is the big flagship of those, the original one.

605
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:33,763
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was a dollar more.

606
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:40,669
[SPEAKER_11]: The Final Fantasy games, I think, at least the Super Nintendo ones that they put out on Virtual Console, those were a dollar or maybe even two dollars more.

607
00:43:40,689 --> 00:43:41,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they were a dollar more.

608
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Squeenix tax.

609
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:43,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, basically.

610
00:43:44,052 --> 00:43:46,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now this is, you know, Nintendo tax.

611
00:43:46,954 --> 00:43:47,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Both.

612
00:43:48,276 --> 00:43:50,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, so why are they charging the increased price?

613
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:51,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they can, honestly.

614
00:43:52,459 --> 00:43:52,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

615
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotta make up that GameStop exclusive money somewhere.

616
00:43:57,481 --> 00:43:58,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess so.

617
00:43:58,421 --> 00:44:18,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's not like $9.99 is a ripoff, but they are talking about that there's an enhanced value about the Earthbound Strategy Guide, which is out there, and it's enhanced for the Wii U gamepad, and you can actually view it on Nintendo's Earthbound site, which, you know, you press the little home button, go into the browser, and you can open up on the site.

618
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:19,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna be honest...

619
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:25,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I find that feature, and I'm using my quotey fingers, I find that feature to be a little bit disingenuous.

620
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:31,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that's really a feature because you're just advertising a website, basically.

621
00:44:32,195 --> 00:44:39,938
[SPEAKER_11]: And to be honest, I could go, I could open up my internet browser and go to GameFacts.com and pull up almost anything that's on Virtual Console.

622
00:44:40,198 --> 00:44:40,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can do that.

623
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:47,702
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool that Nintendo, you know, did the optimized, you know, and scanned it in and made that or whatever.

624
00:44:47,822 --> 00:44:51,925
[SPEAKER_11]: But you technically don't have to own Earthbound to see that.

625
00:44:51,945 --> 00:44:52,866
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

626
00:44:52,886 --> 00:44:55,848
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not really value for buying the game.

627
00:44:56,368 --> 00:45:02,172
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're going to tell me that the $2 was for that, I'm going to tell you that's a crock of shit.

628
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:10,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that would be like me saying, oh, well, with every copy of Donkey Kong sold on the virtual console, you get a free vognetwork.com.

629
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:36,212
[SPEAKER_11]: check it out it's not it doesn't quite work for me I mean cool yay it would be neat if Nintendo would do more manuals and stuff but you know what would be even better is if instead of having to press the home button having to press the internet browser button having to enter in earthbound.nintendo.com having to wait for the thing to load you know what would be even better than that

630
00:45:36,952 --> 00:45:37,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

631
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:54,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Get online and speed some things up a little bit.

632
00:45:56,475 --> 00:45:58,055
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess this is a baby step.

633
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:04,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you know with your copy of Balloon Flight that you can actually get a free copy of Pornhub?

634
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:05,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Free porn.

635
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:08,080
[SPEAKER_12]: With a Nintendo title.

636
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's ridiculous.

637
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,222
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's optimized.

638
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:18,725
[SPEAKER_11]: ShadowNextGen in chat at live.vognetwork.com says the guide from Nintendo would most likely be better than what you will find on GameFAQs.

639
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:19,525
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

640
00:46:19,806 --> 00:46:19,946
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

641
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:23,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I... Graphically, yes.

642
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:26,485
[SPEAKER_11]: For the retro-minded in you, yes.

643
00:46:26,786 --> 00:46:31,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, again, for the whole, like, tickling your retro tastes or whatever, yes.

644
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:34,654
[SPEAKER_11]: But GameFAQs will honestly be faster.

645
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:36,536
[SPEAKER_11]: That site was slow as hell when I was playing with it.

646
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:40,601
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably outsourced anyway, so you're probably gonna get... It's probably gonna be a Prima guide or something.

647
00:46:42,103 --> 00:46:42,283
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

648
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:43,888
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, it wasn't.

649
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:50,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, this was years ago, but every copy of Earthbound, when you bought it, it came in that bigger box.

650
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:56,091
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe, I could be wrong, I believe it was a whole thing tied in to push Nintendo Power subscriptions.

651
00:46:56,591 --> 00:46:59,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Because remember how Nintendo Power would do those guides?

652
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:01,653
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one for Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy.

653
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:02,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Mario Paint.

654
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:07,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I could be wrong, but I thought Earthbound was technically one of those guides.

655
00:47:07,794 --> 00:47:10,995
[SPEAKER_11]: And that there were things in there to try to get you to get a Nintendo Power subscription.

656
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:13,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I had the Mario Paint one.

657
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:14,825
[SPEAKER_12]: That was freaking sweet.

658
00:47:14,905 --> 00:47:16,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm having to think back almost 20 years here.

659
00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:17,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

660
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:24,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, all sorts of pixel art in there for doing animated Yoshis and all sorts of fun stuff.

661
00:47:25,873 --> 00:47:28,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Alpha Cananogram says, The online US guide sucks.

662
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:33,495
[SPEAKER_11]: The Nintendo Europe site has the PDF to download, and you put it on your iPad.

663
00:47:33,996 --> 00:47:36,056
[SPEAKER_11]: That's honestly how I've been doing a lot of playthroughs.

664
00:47:36,096 --> 00:47:40,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just Nintendo, but even 360 and PlayStation 3 as well.

665
00:47:40,418 --> 00:47:42,318
[SPEAKER_11]: I pull up the thing on my iPad.

666
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:43,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Works great.

667
00:47:44,899 --> 00:47:49,885
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and BlackWolf says, it was a Nintendo guide, not a Prima guide.

668
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:51,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Could have still been outsourced, though.

669
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:55,310
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't necessarily, I mean, it could have, it didn't necessarily have to come in internally from Nintendo.

670
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,612
[SPEAKER_11]: It could have, but, you know.

671
00:47:58,305 --> 00:48:00,366
[SPEAKER_11]: But they had the hotline, didn't they?

672
00:48:01,387 --> 00:48:03,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they still did at that time, yeah.

673
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:05,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, the game counselors, absolutely.

674
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:07,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

675
00:48:09,391 --> 00:48:16,155
[SPEAKER_11]: To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Thunder.

676
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on, DarkSakura.

677
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:19,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Venture

678
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:41,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, you brought that up on the show before.

679
00:48:41,443 --> 00:48:43,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've done Venture as a classic.

680
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:44,104
[SPEAKER_07]: If I haven't, I should.

681
00:48:44,284 --> 00:48:44,724
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you have.

682
00:48:45,504 --> 00:48:53,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, speaking of classic games, and this is, everybody has been messaging me this to show Dan, and Dan knows.

683
00:48:53,687 --> 00:48:54,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.

684
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:54,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course Dan knows.

685
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:56,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course Dan knows.

686
00:48:56,348 --> 00:48:58,148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice that people think of you, though.

687
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everybody.

688
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:05,491
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there, keep in mind, Dan used to run a site called Neo Striders Strider Zone.

689
00:49:06,931 --> 00:49:11,794
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was one of two Strider sites that existed back in the days when people had websites on AOL.

690
00:49:12,214 --> 00:49:14,976
[SPEAKER_12]: He was probably sitting there all of a sudden the hair on his arm went up.

691
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:16,476
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, Strider news has been announced.

692
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:26,162
[SPEAKER_07]: He turned red in the face and like all of a sudden weird signals came from his head where he started accepting the vibe of Strider as it flowed.

693
00:49:26,302 --> 00:49:26,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Did he cry?

694
00:49:26,682 --> 00:49:27,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Was there a little shaking?

695
00:49:27,462 --> 00:49:28,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he peed a little.

696
00:49:28,323 --> 00:49:28,683
Deep breath.

697
00:49:30,376 --> 00:49:32,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I'm glad that he's not listening right now.

698
00:49:32,977 --> 00:49:34,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I love you, Dan.

699
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,379
[SPEAKER_11]: What other embarrassing Dan stories do you want to tell?

700
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you, mean it.

701
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:41,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I did say that I was going to clone his liver and sell multiple copies on eBay.

702
00:49:41,782 --> 00:49:45,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Because livers are worth the money, man.

703
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:49,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I told him if he ever pissed me off, I'd punch him until he peed blood.

704
00:49:51,465 --> 00:49:52,886
[SPEAKER_12]: You make that thread of a lot of people, though.

705
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:53,507
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.

706
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:55,228
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't just throw that around willy-nilly.

707
00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:57,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I only do that to people I care about.

708
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, by the way.

709
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so yeah, I mentioned Strider.

710
00:50:02,475 --> 00:50:03,175
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Strider.

711
00:50:03,435 --> 00:50:11,602
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a version of Strider which is supposed to be a series reboot, from what I understand, like a redoing of the first game.

712
00:50:12,103 --> 00:50:15,105
[SPEAKER_07]: From what we could see of the trailer, it looked like the whole first level.

713
00:50:15,506 --> 00:50:18,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's being done by Double Helix, who is also working on Killer Instinct, so...

714
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:23,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, this looks like it would be a lot better than that Killer Instinct thing, so I have some high hopes.

715
00:50:25,173 --> 00:50:31,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Watching the gameplay, it was really, really cool.

716
00:50:32,858 --> 00:50:37,601
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't so much walk as Dash everywhere he goes, he runs with purpose.

717
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:40,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And now keep in mind, I loved Strider 2.

718
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved the updated thing.

719
00:50:42,432 --> 00:50:46,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved every appearance of Strider, hear you, in Marvel vs. Capcom.

720
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,301
[SPEAKER_07]: The various Marvel vs. Capcoms when he was playable.

721
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:57,610
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of my favorite characters of all time, thanks to Dan making me sit down and said, any person I marry is going to beat Strider.

722
00:50:59,372 --> 00:51:04,074
[SPEAKER_07]: on Genesis, which I have, and finally beaten on arcade and beaten PlayStation version, blah, blah, blah, blah.

723
00:51:04,915 --> 00:51:07,276
[SPEAKER_07]: That last fight with the stupid master is a bitch.

724
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:09,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pain in the ass.

725
00:51:09,717 --> 00:51:17,061
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, so yeah, we both have a lot of happy going on in our house because of Strider.

726
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you even love Strider on the NES?

727
00:51:20,103 --> 00:51:21,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to tell you about Strider on the NES.

728
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:24,105
[SPEAKER_07]: It's based off the manga.

729
00:51:25,558 --> 00:51:27,320
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is not the arcade game.

730
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,723
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got this one jump that's like freaking impossible.

731
00:51:31,204 --> 00:51:34,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we own the game and I think Dan kind of likes it.

732
00:51:34,547 --> 00:51:35,868
[SPEAKER_11]: The infamous triangle jump.

733
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:37,010
[SPEAKER_07]: The triangle jump, yes.

734
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like the story in the game.

735
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:40,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I've read the manga.

736
00:51:42,195 --> 00:51:43,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like playing it.

737
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:49,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would much rather play the original Strider any day.

738
00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:52,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved Strider on the NES because I didn't have a Genesis.

739
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:54,392
[SPEAKER_11]: We weren't really a Sega household.

740
00:51:54,432 --> 00:51:55,313
[SPEAKER_11]: We were all Nintendo.

741
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:57,754
[SPEAKER_11]: So I played Strider on the NES.

742
00:51:57,774 --> 00:51:58,435
[SPEAKER_11]: I really liked it.

743
00:51:58,575 --> 00:52:03,718
[SPEAKER_11]: And hearing that this new game is kind of Metroidvania-ish made me think of the NES version.

744
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:06,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that the NES was really Metroidvania, but it had the different stages.

745
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:14,826
[SPEAKER_11]: The Nintendo Strider, I'm almost positive, was the same engine that DuckTales used because they were very similar where you would select a stage.

746
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,587
[SPEAKER_11]: You would go to the various areas.

747
00:52:16,907 --> 00:52:17,888
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Capcom.

748
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:18,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean it was...

749
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:20,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

750
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:59,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Strider in the arcade a couple of times and it wasn't really my thing and I didn't play it on Nintendo but like I said Dan sat me down and said any woman I marry is going to play Strider so I've beaten Ghosts and Goblins 2 which made me want to cry tears of blood but Strider at least is a fun game and you know he actually told me a little bit of trivia about that too is that it was going to be a regular cartridge but because they wanted to put the Amazon level in it

751
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:03,611
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually upped the memory in it so they can include the Amazon level and have the music and everything.

752
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:03,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

753
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:04,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

754
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:11,393
[SPEAKER_11]: So... So this news fills a certain hole in your heart that not even Moondiver could fill, right?

755
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:12,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

756
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:14,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Moondiver was a good game.

757
00:53:14,813 --> 00:53:20,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a spiritual successor in the series, but we need to have Strider.

758
00:53:21,655 --> 00:53:22,135
[SPEAKER_07]: No one...

759
00:53:22,675 --> 00:53:37,092
[SPEAKER_07]: and what I'm kind of hoping is that with this we get some of the elements from Strider 2 like we see Hien you know because I actually I really like to play through the game with Hien that was really fun the guy who had two ciphers it was really cool but um

760
00:53:38,126 --> 00:53:39,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I have high hopes for this.

761
00:53:39,387 --> 00:53:40,167
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty.

762
00:53:40,267 --> 00:53:42,068
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it plays solidly.

763
00:53:43,069 --> 00:53:45,070
[SPEAKER_07]: The backgrounds were amazing.

764
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,090
[SPEAKER_07]: The music was amazing.

765
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was the same first level that I heard.

766
00:53:49,452 --> 00:53:51,994
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will keep my fingers crossed.

767
00:53:52,014 --> 00:54:00,698
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people have been frowning a little bit hearing who's developing this because, you know, the new Killer Instinct game, which I don't know.

768
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's hard to judge a game that's not even out.

769
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:03,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

770
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:28,224
[SPEAKER_11]: but Silent Hill Homecoming has a lot of people kind of nervous but you know I don't know if it's we really have to wait till the game's out I mean WayForward does a lot of great retro updates now dude they made Ping Pals if I remember right so that game was literally the worst handheld game in history so if you know this that company can do better after their first couple attempts I'm willing to give these guys a chance

771
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:57,346
[SPEAKER_07]: and like I said I looked at the trailer and it really would be hard to screw up Strider unless there were major timing and physics issues other than that it really looked very solid and all they have to do is take the timing physics from the original and they would know exactly how to do it and like I said I've played other versions of Strider we actually have the PC Engine version which we can't play because we don't have the card for it, the arcade card but

772
00:54:58,246 --> 00:55:01,188
[SPEAKER_07]: That one even... I don't think it would be too hard.

773
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:02,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't think it would be too hard.

774
00:55:02,268 --> 00:55:06,110
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd have to really screw up, like I said, timing and physics to ruin the game.

775
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:09,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, maybe really shitty voice acting.

776
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:10,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Which...

777
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:16,431
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't get... Even the first game actually had pretty... The original had pretty decent voice acting in it.

778
00:55:16,871 --> 00:55:20,332
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all in whatever the native language of whoever the character was.

779
00:55:20,832 --> 00:55:22,053
[SPEAKER_07]: But it has the best line in it.

780
00:55:22,873 --> 00:55:23,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, gotcha.

781
00:55:24,474 --> 00:55:24,994
[SPEAKER_07]: The one guy.

782
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:27,235
[SPEAKER_12]: And the new one's like, I'm Strider!

783
00:55:27,315 --> 00:55:29,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna hit you with my sword!

784
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:31,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, hi, I hear you!

785
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:33,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

786
00:55:34,897 --> 00:55:37,078
[SPEAKER_07]: They better give him the uber-bishy voice, you know?

787
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:41,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised they waited to announce this for Comic Con.

788
00:55:41,534 --> 00:55:44,156
[SPEAKER_11]: That they didn't bring this out at E3.

789
00:55:44,196 --> 00:55:45,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, maybe it just wasn't ready.

790
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:49,740
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of the games that the fans have been dying to get a new game of.

791
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry Mega Man, you guys fucking suck.

792
00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:57,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy the Game Boy games on 3DS.

793
00:55:57,565 --> 00:55:59,446
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mega Man thing I think is Spite now.

794
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:07,112
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm actually a little bit more excited about Strider than I am about a Mega Man game, so.

795
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:17,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a Mega Man project's in the works, but I think with this Strider news and so forth and Mega Man and Smash, I think there'll be something next year.

796
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,482
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, easy to say, right?

797
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:22,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Any Strider analyst can say that.

798
00:56:23,063 --> 00:56:24,164
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's move on.

799
00:56:24,204 --> 00:56:24,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

800
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:29,087
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be really awesome as if they do a new Mega Man unit.

801
00:56:29,107 --> 00:56:31,948
[SPEAKER_12]: It's done by, was it WayForward, actually?

802
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:33,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, you know.

803
00:56:33,629 --> 00:56:35,110
[SPEAKER_07]: There were comments to that in the chat room, too.

804
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:38,275
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.

805
00:56:39,403 --> 00:56:39,846
[SPEAKER_12]: They can't do it.

806
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,807
[SPEAKER_12]: If the DuckTales thing goes well, you never know.

807
00:56:42,988 --> 00:56:43,569
[SPEAKER_12]: That looks cool.

808
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:49,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so NCAA, there was a bit of drama with that, considering that the game just came out.

809
00:56:50,394 --> 00:56:54,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, NCAA is not renewing its contract with EA.

810
00:56:55,338 --> 00:56:59,262
[SPEAKER_12]: This will be, I guess, the last year that it'll be called NCAA Football 14.

811
00:57:00,262 --> 00:57:05,607
[SPEAKER_12]: However, and I know they have a lawsuit against them, and this is from 2008, basically saying that...

812
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:18,474
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say it was because they've never licensed the use of current student athlete names, images, or likenesses.

813
00:57:19,074 --> 00:57:32,140
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the whole reason that they're not renewing their contract with them is they're trying to distance themselves from EA because EA is kind of going around them and putting these students in the game.

814
00:57:33,961 --> 00:57:37,382
[SPEAKER_12]: and I guess EA is still going to be making college football games.

815
00:57:37,402 --> 00:57:43,864
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll just probably be called EA Sports College Football 15 next year or something like that.

816
00:57:45,645 --> 00:57:59,990
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, you know, they're just saying that once again, even like some attorneys that are dealing with the whole lawsuit are saying, yeah, it's basically an announcement makes plain that NCAA is attempting to mitigate the damages of

817
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:15,818
[SPEAKER_12]: They say that our suit illustrates the cabal between NCAA and EA has exploited student athletes for years using their images in video games without compensation.

818
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:16,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that sounds like EA.

819
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:29,267
[SPEAKER_12]: While we are heartened that they've stopped the practice, we believe that they owe students or student-athletes a great deal more than implied promise to stop stealing their images.

820
00:58:29,687 --> 00:58:30,848
[SPEAKER_12]: So how's that going to work next year?

821
00:58:30,888 --> 00:58:34,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they actually going to stop using the student images?

822
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:38,733
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just going to be like generic people on a team type thing?

823
00:58:38,953 --> 00:58:41,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going like EA Sports Tech Mobile here?

824
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, how's that going to work?

825
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:44,237
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know.

826
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:46,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

827
00:58:48,246 --> 00:58:52,708
[SPEAKER_12]: And I even read in chat or something that they were saying that next year is going to be all next-gen anyways.

828
00:58:53,308 --> 00:58:54,989
[SPEAKER_12]: No current-gen version of the game.

829
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Could be a chance to kind of reboot, reinvent things a little bit.

830
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:02,332
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be interesting to see if 2K comes back with a college football game.

831
00:59:03,513 --> 00:59:10,356
[SPEAKER_12]: The last one, remember how they tried to do that whole American football or I forget what their one.

832
00:59:10,516 --> 00:59:14,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Had this weird lineup of people in there and stuff and fake teams and stuff.

833
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:19,866
[SPEAKER_12]: and that didn't work out too well but it'd be kind of neat to see 2K come back and do you know

834
00:59:20,759 --> 00:59:24,040
[SPEAKER_11]: How important is it to have the actual people in the game?

835
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't play a whole lot of sports games, but it's never really mattered to me for the games I've played.

836
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:33,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but for sports games, you want to play as your favorite players and stuff.

837
00:59:34,024 --> 00:59:38,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I realize the EA NCAA games didn't actually have the player.

838
00:59:38,806 --> 00:59:41,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, they were all there except in name.

839
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:43,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's what it was, right?

840
00:59:43,428 --> 00:59:45,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Their stats were what you would expect to see.

841
00:59:45,689 --> 00:59:48,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Their looks were what you would expect to see with subtle changes.

842
00:59:49,091 --> 00:59:49,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the names weren't there.

843
00:59:50,191 --> 01:00:02,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it's just, they want, you know, they, just like, you know, if you were playing an NBA game, you'd want to have, you know, they pay those players to use their likenesses and stuff in the game.

844
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:06,259
[SPEAKER_12]: So the thing is, why aren't they paying these college students?

845
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:07,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they think they can get away with it.

846
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, what's a college student going to do?

847
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:09,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Try to sue me?

848
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:10,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Ha, you're broke.

849
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:11,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, seriously.

850
01:00:13,002 --> 01:00:14,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they can't, they can't profit.

851
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:17,685
[SPEAKER_12]: It's NCAA regulations that they can't do that.

852
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:20,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, NCAA is saying that they never license that stuff to them.

853
01:00:20,506 --> 01:00:25,870
[SPEAKER_12]: They're basically saying, oh, well, we didn't do this, but they're still getting this stuff in the game anyway.

854
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Bobby in chat wants to clarify.

855
01:00:28,111 --> 01:00:31,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby Blackwolf says, they only lost the NCAA name, nothing else.

856
01:00:31,793 --> 01:00:34,175
[SPEAKER_11]: The colleges and bowls and stadiums and stuff are still EA.

857
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:37,176
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing they lost is the NCAA name and the NCAA logo.

858
01:00:37,196 --> 01:00:37,517
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

859
01:00:38,317 --> 01:00:39,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then that won't affect anything.

860
01:00:40,444 --> 01:00:40,964
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't think?

861
01:00:41,324 --> 01:00:41,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think.

862
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it'll be a big deal either.

863
01:00:43,626 --> 01:00:45,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I think at the end of the day, a good game is a good game.

864
01:00:46,027 --> 01:00:47,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I love Tecmo Bowl.

865
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:48,969
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like my favorite football game.

866
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:50,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And it didn't really have any of that.

867
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,371
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, anyhow.

868
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:58,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on.

869
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:01,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of gaming things being shown at Comic-Con.

870
01:01:01,685 --> 01:01:18,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I know gaming kind of comes up every year at Comic-Con, but it definitely seems like there's more of it this year than we usually see, and that probably has something to do with the fact that we have new consoles coming this year, so obviously the companies want to push that to the potential buying audience, of which a lot of them are at Comic-Con right now, although I'm not there.

871
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:19,680
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

872
01:01:20,601 --> 01:01:22,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony is at Comic Con with the PlayStation 4.

873
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:28,985
[SPEAKER_11]: They have Knack and Drive Club out there open for play, letting the public experience PlayStation 4.

874
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:32,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would be a safe bet to say those games will show up.

875
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:35,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything you're hearing here, these games will get in a truck and move to PAX in a couple weeks.

876
01:01:35,948 --> 01:01:36,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

877
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:42,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Octodad, I guess, is part of PlayStation 4 as well.

878
01:01:42,692 --> 01:01:45,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Gran Turismo 6 is also there, even though technically that's not next-gen.

879
01:01:45,893 --> 01:01:46,393
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still there.

880
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:47,454
[SPEAKER_11]: It still looks nice.

881
01:01:47,634 --> 01:01:54,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Microsoft has Rise with the Y, Rise, and Killer Instinct out there on the floor.

882
01:01:54,736 --> 01:01:56,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Killer Instinct drawing pretty good crowds.

883
01:01:56,636 --> 01:01:57,996
[SPEAKER_11]: It's apparently Rise is too.

884
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:07,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently other games being shown out there, Dead Rising 3, Assassin's Creed 4, and Watch Dogs all there at Comic-Con.

885
01:02:07,678 --> 01:02:08,458
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just a taste.

886
01:02:08,498 --> 01:02:11,619
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just some of the stuff that involves next-gen and the big companies.

887
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:15,980
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there any comics to be found at Comic-Con out of curiosity?

888
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Marvel's got a whole big thing.

889
01:02:18,221 --> 01:02:18,942
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know.

890
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:21,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, they actually did announce the next Avengers movie.

891
01:02:21,824 --> 01:02:22,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but that's a movie.

892
01:02:22,645 --> 01:02:23,245
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a comic.

893
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:24,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it's still Marvel.

894
01:02:25,066 --> 01:02:27,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And why are they fucking going with Age of Ultron?

895
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:27,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Ugh!

896
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:28,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

897
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:29,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a fan?

898
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:30,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a fan of Ultron.

899
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're doing the same thing in the comics.

900
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,393
[SPEAKER_07]: They tease Thanos.

901
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:44,915
[SPEAKER_11]: So here I go talking about movies on the Video Game Podcast, but I went to go see This is the End last night, which was funny.

902
01:02:45,155 --> 01:02:47,376
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of those movies that was so stupid.

903
01:02:48,417 --> 01:02:53,960
[SPEAKER_11]: It's seriously stupid, but to the point where it's actually really funny.

904
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,202
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so stupid you can't help but laugh, like a lot of stoner comedies are.

905
01:02:57,222 --> 01:02:57,842
[SPEAKER_11]: It was great.

906
01:02:58,122 --> 01:02:59,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I had a good time.

907
01:02:59,183 --> 01:02:59,523
[SPEAKER_11]: It was good.

908
01:02:59,823 --> 01:03:02,505
[SPEAKER_11]: But I got home, and the first news that greets me when I get home,

909
01:03:03,385 --> 01:03:07,587
[SPEAKER_11]: The Superman sequel will have Batman in it.

910
01:03:08,508 --> 01:03:13,470
[SPEAKER_11]: They're doing the Superman versus Batman thing that was in one of the... I'm just like, stop.

911
01:03:13,491 --> 01:03:13,671
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

912
01:03:14,111 --> 01:03:14,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop.

913
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:23,836
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know this is a whole to build up to the Justice League movie that they have to do because Marvel's got the Avengers, so now DC's got to do this.

914
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:24,977
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like, no.

915
01:03:25,837 --> 01:03:26,057
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

916
01:03:26,498 --> 01:03:32,281
[SPEAKER_11]: You do not get to do a Justice League movie until you fucking do a Wonder Woman movie.

917
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:59,566
[SPEAKER_11]: you don't get to debut her no she needs her own movie and it needs to be good because if it sucks you don't get to do a Justice League movie and I don't I god the whole idea of Batman and Superman is just I don't I don't like that I don't know like I get that it's based on a comic and it was a real thing and everything but I don't know maybe there's just that part of me that holds out hope for a fourth bail Batman movie which I realize they probably couldn't do because of the story and everything but damn it there's always a way

918
01:04:01,107 --> 01:04:16,322
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to see a sequel to Suburban Commando but instead of having Hulk Hogan in the movie it'll be Christian Bale Batman and he'll be like going around the neighborhood driving a car just a regular car not the Batmobile just like growling at people you know that'd be fun maybe babysitting some kids

919
01:04:19,794 --> 01:04:25,395
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some Marvel vs. DC chat going on in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com And all the Marvel people are right.

920
01:04:26,176 --> 01:04:29,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Brad from PodCulture says, You should ask if any good comics are there.

921
01:04:29,677 --> 01:04:30,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Who reads Marvel?

922
01:04:31,478 --> 01:04:32,238
[SPEAKER_07]: People with taste.

923
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:33,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Snap.

924
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:36,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Slidekick says, I've always preferred Marvel for superheroes.

925
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,300
[SPEAKER_11]: People, please.

926
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,901
[SPEAKER_11]: There's good and bad on both sides.

927
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,461
[SPEAKER_11]: There's good and bad on both sides.

928
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:43,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, check out Rocket Raccoon.

929
01:04:44,975 --> 01:04:46,215
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about image anyways.

930
01:05:08,278 --> 01:05:16,680
[SPEAKER_12]: You heard at Comic-Con, I don't know if there was a panel or something with David Coveney and the whole X-Files crew and stuff, but he wants to bring that back.

931
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,021
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, yes, please, that would be fantastic.

932
01:05:20,101 --> 01:05:26,503
[SPEAKER_12]: I still haven't seen the second movie, which I hear is really dumb, but I would love to have them just bring it back.

933
01:05:26,543 --> 01:05:28,484
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're both not really fucking doing anything.

934
01:05:29,344 --> 01:05:32,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Just bring back a whole new series and set it 20 years later and...

935
01:05:34,065 --> 01:05:37,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Pick up from where it left off.

936
01:05:37,468 --> 01:05:38,328
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be fantastic.

937
01:05:42,912 --> 01:05:43,392
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

938
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:46,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on with more news.

939
01:05:46,674 --> 01:05:50,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Classic Game of the Week, still a little bit away, and release dates coming up right after this.

940
01:05:51,098 --> 01:05:51,538
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.

941
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:54,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready to friend some butts?

942
01:05:56,109 --> 01:05:56,389
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

943
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:58,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I explained that to Dan, by the way.

944
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,850
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, you guys are weird.

945
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:06,231
[SPEAKER_07]: So Nintendo has trademarked two game names that will really do hint to Seaman.

946
01:06:08,772 --> 01:06:17,754
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the rights to Mysterious Pet, Legend of the Fish with a Human Face, and Mysterious Partner, Legend of the Fish with a Human Face.

947
01:06:18,815 --> 01:06:22,636
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was registered in Japan.

948
01:06:22,796 --> 01:06:23,156
[SPEAKER_07]: It was...

949
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:37,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there have been some goings-on with the creator of Seaman, who is Yut Saito, who did work with Nintendo for GameCube content.

950
01:06:37,582 --> 01:06:42,665
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a pinball game, Odama, and the Guild 101 thing...

951
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:46,720
[SPEAKER_08]: AeroPorter.

952
01:06:47,381 --> 01:06:50,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could be possible that we may be seeing another Seaman.

953
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:55,705
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd have to put out a micro... Well, I guess the microphone's already built into the controller, so who knows?

954
01:06:56,326 --> 01:07:03,250
[SPEAKER_12]: On both the 3DS and on the... Well, 3DS DS and Wii U. Wii U friend as butt.

955
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:04,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, not friend as butt.

956
01:07:05,091 --> 01:07:09,513
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually, it doesn't sound very exciting, but... Sure, why not?

957
01:07:10,974 --> 01:07:11,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

958
01:07:11,154 --> 01:07:11,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

959
01:07:12,188 --> 01:07:15,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that buttfriending should be a thing.

960
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:17,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Click to buttfriend.

961
01:07:17,514 --> 01:07:21,518
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's a lot of people that don't get that joke, and I'm trying to find that original YouTube.

962
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was a while back.

963
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:25,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it a Let's Play?

964
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:26,002
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a long time ago.

965
01:07:26,082 --> 01:07:29,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Some dude doing a Let's Play with that game, Seaman.

966
01:07:29,686 --> 01:07:34,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it was like Seaman Gameplay or Yeah, Let's Play.

967
01:07:36,255 --> 01:07:38,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming Tigerclaw could probably find it.

968
01:07:38,377 --> 01:07:39,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Tigerclaw, do your job.

969
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:40,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Find us the link.

970
01:07:42,241 --> 01:07:42,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully.

971
01:07:42,841 --> 01:07:43,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Friend his butt for us.

972
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me Tigerclaw that for you.

973
01:07:47,345 --> 01:07:52,050
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like asking about birthdays and it was like, are we friends?

974
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:53,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll friend your butt.

975
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait, I might have found it.

976
01:07:58,015 --> 01:07:59,296
[SPEAKER_11]: I might have beat Tigerclaw to this.

977
01:08:00,698 --> 01:08:01,038
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

978
01:08:03,632 --> 01:08:05,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what month is your birthday in?

979
01:08:05,153 --> 01:08:06,273
[SPEAKER_11]: October You were born in October?

980
01:08:06,293 --> 01:08:10,515
[SPEAKER_11]: No it doesn't Let's try that again In what month were you born?

981
01:08:10,595 --> 01:08:10,855
[SPEAKER_07]: October

982
01:08:33,922 --> 01:08:35,503
[SPEAKER_02]: You were born in October?

983
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:36,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

984
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:41,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat?

985
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:43,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Treat.

986
01:08:45,711 --> 01:08:46,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the spice?

987
01:08:48,653 --> 01:08:48,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

988
01:08:50,955 --> 01:08:53,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can look, but don't touch.

989
01:08:55,378 --> 01:08:56,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to touch you.

990
01:08:59,941 --> 01:09:00,762
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want?

991
01:09:01,723 --> 01:09:02,243
[SPEAKER_05]: To touch you.

992
01:09:04,133 --> 01:09:05,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that word.

993
01:09:06,554 --> 01:09:07,335
[SPEAKER_05]: You just said it.

994
01:09:07,395 --> 01:09:10,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what day is your birthday on?

995
01:09:12,257 --> 01:09:12,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

996
01:09:14,058 --> 01:09:14,819
[SPEAKER_02]: The second?

997
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:16,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, bitch.

998
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.

999
01:09:21,642 --> 01:09:25,044
[SPEAKER_11]: This honestly sounds like me talking to Siri.

1000
01:09:25,644 --> 01:09:27,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you are as peaceful as he.

1001
01:09:28,566 --> 01:09:33,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.

1002
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:35,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.

1003
01:09:38,003 --> 01:09:44,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know.

1004
01:09:45,705 --> 01:09:47,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, what would the neighbors think?

1005
01:09:48,545 --> 01:09:49,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck them.

1006
01:09:51,946 --> 01:09:52,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck them!

1007
01:09:54,287 --> 01:09:55,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, why all the noise?

1008
01:09:57,868 --> 01:09:58,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mama.

1009
01:10:00,648 --> 01:10:01,008
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1010
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:02,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mama.

1011
01:10:05,174 --> 01:10:05,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Mama.

1012
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:09,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, I'm just fine.

1013
01:10:10,097 --> 01:10:10,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

1014
01:10:12,518 --> 01:10:13,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm busy.

1015
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't look busy.

1016
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:22,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.

1017
01:10:23,605 --> 01:10:27,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?

1018
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:29,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't get any ideas about me.

1019
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:31,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just be friends.

1020
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:33,031
[SPEAKER_02]: For now.

1021
01:10:36,348 --> 01:10:37,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll friend your butt.

1022
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you coming on to me?

1023
01:10:40,692 --> 01:10:41,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1024
01:10:41,433 --> 01:10:43,475
[SPEAKER_11]: There, there it is.

1025
01:10:43,495 --> 01:10:46,918
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how it floats closer to the... Two minutes and 30 seconds later.

1026
01:10:47,098 --> 01:10:49,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, credit to YouTube user EbolaWorld for that.

1027
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:51,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally just stole that there.

1028
01:10:51,342 --> 01:10:54,485
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's where that joke comes from, the whole I'll friend your butt thing, which is great.

1029
01:10:54,865 --> 01:10:58,169
[SPEAKER_11]: So lots of Let's Plays, I'm sure, coming.

1030
01:10:58,429 --> 01:11:01,712
[SPEAKER_11]: If this happens to be true, which I kind of hope it is, that would be great.

1031
01:11:03,046 --> 01:11:07,947
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually did play the game to completion and set our little frogman free.

1032
01:11:09,068 --> 01:11:11,408
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Dan's like, I wonder if he's still there.

1033
01:11:14,309 --> 01:11:15,569
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have our save files intact.

1034
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:17,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

1035
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:25,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming out a lot sooner than any Seaman reboot.

1036
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:33,493
[SPEAKER_12]: We could definitely use a Seaman reboot this week because all we have is the Smurfs 2.

1037
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:36,036
[SPEAKER_12]: The official game.

1038
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:37,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Electric Boogaloo.

1039
01:11:37,517 --> 01:11:38,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

1040
01:11:38,938 --> 01:11:42,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.

1041
01:11:42,442 --> 01:11:43,323
[SPEAKER_07]: You said Wii Wii.

1042
01:11:44,944 --> 01:11:48,087
[SPEAKER_12]: I said Wii Wii U. Wii Wii U.

1043
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:52,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, then I guess we travel to Japan.

1044
01:11:52,367 --> 01:11:52,988
[SPEAKER_11]: That was quick.

1045
01:11:53,548 --> 01:11:54,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at some of the release dates in Japan.

1046
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:58,011
[SPEAKER_11]: On the PlayStation 3 this week, quite a bit actually.

1047
01:11:58,111 --> 01:12:03,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragon's Crown, Ketsui, Kizuna, Jigoku Tachi Extra in regular and limited edition.

1048

[SPEAKER_11]: Majo Tohai Kihei comes out as well in regular and limited.

1049
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:11,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Race Driver Grid 2 and X-Blade Code Embryo.

1050
01:12:11,981 --> 01:12:16,064
[SPEAKER_11]: And Zone of the Enders HD Edition gets a price reduction this week.

1051
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:16,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1052
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots and lots of releases there.

1053
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:30,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Also going to on the Xbox 360, I don't think there's really anything on the 360.

1054
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:32,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, what did you expect?

1055
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Also looking at the PlayStation Vita.

1056
01:12:39,145 --> 01:12:48,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragon's Crown, X-Blaze Code Embryo, Next Rev Iken, Dragon's Crown Famitsu Pack

1057
01:12:53,341 --> 01:13:17,087
[SPEAKER_11]: and looking at the let's see on the Wii U the Wii U does have Lego City undercover getting its Japanese release this week and also a new gamepad battery pack which I think was reported on a couple weeks ago that is actually getting its release in Japan this week as far as peripherals go going to the 3DS Gaikuten Saiban 5 is finally released from Capcom and

1058
01:13:17,508 --> 01:13:24,761
[SPEAKER_11]: and that is the Phoenix Wright game basically Ace Attorney that's the one with Apollo and all the folks in it is that the one that's rated M?

1059
01:13:25,102 --> 01:13:27,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I heard I don't think so

1060
01:13:27,952 --> 01:13:29,073
[SPEAKER_11]: for its release over here.

1061
01:13:29,973 --> 01:13:34,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, that is out in Japan this week, and there's a whole lot of peripherals to come with that.

1062
01:13:35,237 --> 01:13:39,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantasy Life Link and Chibi Devil 2, Mahou no Yume Ihon.

1063
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:40,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Toh.

1064
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:42,982
[SPEAKER_11]: And... Is that... No.

1065
01:13:43,683 --> 01:13:44,643
[SPEAKER_11]: It was no, not toh.

1066
01:13:44,783 --> 01:13:45,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Toh, oh.

1067
01:13:45,784 --> 01:13:52,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Beast Saga Saikyou Gekutosu Coliseum comes out on the 3DS this week.

1068
01:13:52,088 --> 01:13:52,869
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a busy week in Japan.

1069
01:13:52,889 --> 01:13:53,469
[SPEAKER_07]: That's interesting.

1070
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:54,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

1071
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:54,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

1072
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,672
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've seen that before somewhere, but I don't know.

1073
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:04,907
[SPEAKER_11]: And lastly, yes, there are still PCP, or PCP, PSP games coming.

1074
01:14:05,727 --> 01:14:08,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Daya no Kuni no Alice, Wonderful Mirror World.

1075
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:11,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that's based off like Alice in Wonderland type of game.

1076
01:14:12,212 --> 01:14:13,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it is, or Through the Looking Glass.

1077
01:14:13,953 --> 01:14:15,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Like an anime, oh yeah, see, look.

1078
01:14:16,454 --> 01:14:19,897
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mad Hatter is a sexy... That's the March Hare.

1079
01:14:20,077 --> 01:14:21,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the Mad Hatter's right behind him.

1080
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:26,421
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all sexy, like, you know, anime style.

1081
01:14:27,121 --> 01:14:47,493
[SPEAKER_07]: and Toki no Keizuna Hanamatsubi to Zuri comes out in regular and limited edition and there's a twin pack as well lots of games not so many for the UK on the 22nd we have RuneScape 3 for PC on the 25th I have no idea how this is supposed to say rimmed capsule is that it?

1082
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:55,798
[SPEAKER_07]: rimmed capsule on iPad, Android, and iPhone Shadowrun returns for iPad, Android, Mac, and PC and on the 26th we have Pikmin 3 for Wii U

1083
01:14:57,682 --> 01:14:58,002
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over.

1084
01:15:11,488 --> 01:15:29,494
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people would say that the Xbox One might be a little rushed or even some of these next-gen systems, but there was some news that came out regarding Forza Motorsports 5 saying that the game was going to require a one-time download before it can be played.

1085
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:42,059
[SPEAKER_12]: and that they were basically at such a crunch for time that they were putting the framework of the game together.

1086
01:15:42,199 --> 01:15:49,102
[SPEAKER_12]: They're getting that pressed to disk and then they were going to be working on the tracks up until launch.

1087
01:15:50,746 --> 01:16:02,129
[SPEAKER_12]: and so basically you would buy the game and then you'd have to download the rest um you know when you first put the game in the system so you would need to be connected to the internet now

1088
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:06,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, there's been some back and forth about it.

1089
01:16:06,288 --> 01:16:19,074
[SPEAKER_12]: They said, I guess Turn 10's Dan Greenwald, he changed his statement saying that the requirement of a connection to Xbox Live before playing is not the plan.

1090
01:16:19,974 --> 01:16:25,756
[SPEAKER_12]: However, when or if the game requires an internet connection for single player content, it's still not clear.

1091
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:26,677
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

1092
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:31,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1093
01:16:48,473 --> 01:16:55,239
[SPEAKER_12]: When you get to the point where the game is literally not done, it is admitted to be, it is not done.

1094
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:56,700
[SPEAKER_12]: The game is not done.

1095
01:16:57,041 --> 01:17:07,310
[SPEAKER_12]: And now they need to put it on a disc so that you download the rest of the content later because they want to hit that launch window or whatever.

1096
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:08,931
[SPEAKER_12]: That's ridiculous.

1097
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:11,033
[SPEAKER_12]: That is absolutely ridiculous.

1098
01:17:11,113 --> 01:17:12,555
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, I just...

1099
01:17:14,356 --> 01:17:15,277
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the point?

1100
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,238
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't understand.

1101
01:17:41,098 --> 01:17:56,067
[SPEAKER_11]: that really sucks for those people that don't have the internet connection which was a big part of the push to get Xbox One to reverse their policies to begin with and it's not even the internet connection thing let's just skip the whole like people that don't have internet okay because a lot of people do have internet

1102
01:17:57,054 --> 01:18:00,857
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still going to take a long time to download the rest of the content for that game.

1103
01:18:00,977 --> 01:18:08,383
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know DLC and stuff that includes actual new art assets and stuff for at least a few hundred meg.

1104
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:22,134
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you're talking that, you know, let's just assume that the majority of the tracks are on the game, you're talking like a multi-gig download that even on somewhat decent bandwidth or whatever...

1105
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:28,817
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to take at least an hour to download.

1106
01:18:28,977 --> 01:18:31,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to really want to have to deal with that bullshit?

1107
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:38,160
[SPEAKER_12]: That you have to download a big portion of the game in the first place to be able to even play the single player campaign?

1108
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,881
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's just kind of ridiculous that they even would do that.

1109
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:43,131
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1110
01:18:44,531 --> 01:18:51,613
[SPEAKER_12]: And is this something that says, okay, yeah, we're going to have this extra content that we're building up to launch.

1111
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:57,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that mean that later on after it launches that they're going to put all that content onto the disc later on?

1112
01:18:57,755 --> 01:19:01,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they going to do that or are they just going to say, ah, fuck it, whatever?

1113
01:19:04,555 --> 01:19:09,758
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is too much of the letting the day one patch fix your problems.

1114
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:13,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, if this game isn't ready at launch, then don't launch it with it.

1115
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Launch it a couple weeks later.

1116
01:19:15,101 --> 01:19:17,442
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fine, because you're already going to have games coming out.

1117
01:19:17,822 --> 01:19:19,543
[SPEAKER_12]: So what if it doesn't come out day one?

1118
01:19:20,143 --> 01:19:20,544
[SPEAKER_12]: That's okay.

1119
01:19:20,564 --> 01:19:24,306
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sometimes good to have things a little later, too.

1120
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:25,866
[SPEAKER_11]: The Wii U could have used that.

1121
01:19:26,187 --> 01:19:30,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Infamous isn't coming out day one and stuff, and I just don't understand why they wouldn't push it.

1122
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:38,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say that a lot of release dates for games have to do with money and advertising.

1123
01:19:39,298 --> 01:19:43,159
[SPEAKER_07]: With advertising, with deals with distributors.

1124
01:19:43,799 --> 01:19:45,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think that that's where a lot of it comes into.

1125
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:52,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So they set this date that may or may not be realistic and don't want to violate that date.

1126
01:19:52,122 --> 01:19:55,943
[SPEAKER_07]: So they go ahead and ship and keep working on it so that they have the patches ready.

1127
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:57,604
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my thought on why they do that.

1128
01:19:57,704 --> 01:20:00,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would personally prefer them to wait.

1129
01:20:01,246 --> 01:20:02,188
[SPEAKER_12]: I can just shift the date of it.

1130
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:09,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand, yeah, that people plan ahead for advertising, but they're planning holiday advertisements and stuff.

1131
01:20:10,322 --> 01:20:12,165
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little closer than now.

1132
01:20:12,305 --> 01:20:12,846
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, now is...

1133
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:15,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1134
01:20:33,759 --> 01:20:38,041
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a big problem if you know that you're not going to hit your launch and you're already how many months out?

1135
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:39,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Just push it.

1136
01:20:39,621 --> 01:20:41,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Just push the game if it's not going to be ready.

1137
01:20:41,822 --> 01:20:43,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the question is, are other games going to be like this?

1138
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:46,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going to see the same thing with Rise?

1139
01:20:46,143 --> 01:20:49,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they've rushed the launch for this system.

1140
01:20:49,624 --> 01:20:52,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Hasn't Rise been worked on for quite some time now?

1141
01:20:52,365 --> 01:20:52,985
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter.

1142
01:20:53,106 --> 01:20:53,566
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

1143
01:20:53,626 --> 01:20:57,907
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's been games that have shipped incomplete before.

1144
01:20:58,127 --> 01:21:00,628
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just not... I don't know.

1145
01:21:01,368 --> 01:21:03,189
[SPEAKER_12]: It's disheartening, I guess.

1146
01:21:04,029 --> 01:21:05,030
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, whatever.

1147
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,530
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not going to tell anybody about it.

1148
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:08,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I guess they did.

1149
01:21:08,551 --> 01:21:09,171
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of weird.

1150
01:21:09,591 --> 01:21:11,232
[SPEAKER_12]: They probably won't tell the general public about it.

1151
01:21:11,932 --> 01:21:15,834
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be on the box saying, hey, you need to connect to the internet to play this.

1152
01:21:16,034 --> 01:21:16,834
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all incentives.

1153
01:21:17,234 --> 01:21:21,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well here's a game I'm sure they will have no problem delaying until it's damn near perfect.

1154
01:21:21,656 --> 01:21:24,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I mean, sometimes this game gets bugs too.

1155
01:21:25,017 --> 01:21:28,078
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a pretty infamous one on the Wii release of Zelda.

1156
01:21:28,659 --> 01:21:29,459
[SPEAKER_11]: And, come on.

1157
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:31,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Zeldagame on the Wii U

1158
01:21:45,178 --> 01:21:47,420
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like, yes, it's coming, but...

1159
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:11,467
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be awesome.

1160
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:12,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it's coming.

1161
01:22:12,548 --> 01:22:15,470
[SPEAKER_12]: And the demo is on the Wind Waker HD disc.

1162
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:18,072
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome, but probably not happening.

1163
01:22:20,254 --> 01:22:31,743
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, what I really wanted to talk about was an interview with Aonuma who was talking about the tired formula of traditional Zelda games.

1164
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:33,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I might be kind of...

1165
01:22:34,605 --> 01:22:35,326
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tired.

1166
01:22:57,182 --> 01:22:57,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1167
01:23:20,814 --> 01:23:21,074
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1168
01:23:21,395 --> 01:23:25,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Despite the whole fact that he says he's getting tired of it, I wouldn't read too much into that.

1169
01:23:25,378 --> 01:23:34,666
[SPEAKER_11]: I just would think that the next game is going to probably not necessarily be quite like Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess and all that.

1170
01:23:35,106 --> 01:23:36,147
[SPEAKER_11]: It might have some differences.

1171
01:23:36,207 --> 01:23:37,428
[SPEAKER_11]: But we've already heard about that.

1172
01:23:37,889 --> 01:23:44,154
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember a story about three, four months ago that Skyrim was influencing Zelda as well a little bit.

1173
01:23:45,115 --> 01:23:46,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe something more open world?

1174
01:23:46,996 --> 01:23:58,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I would, well, I mean, Zelda kind of already is pretty open world, the more recent ones, but I mean, maybe a little less, I mean, the dungeons could be fluid, but it isn't even like that in Skyrim.

1175
01:23:59,123 --> 01:24:04,466
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you go through a transition from open world to... I used to be an adventurer, but I took a hookshot to the knee.

1176
01:24:05,947 --> 01:24:06,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

1177
01:24:08,642 --> 01:24:08,682
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1178
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:39,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Slidekick is in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and says, that's great news.

1179
01:24:39,752 --> 01:24:44,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Zelda, but Skyward Sword was a step forward in the right direction and they need to continue to experiment with it.

1180
01:24:45,718 --> 01:24:47,260
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you go.

1181
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully we'll get more info on this soon.

1182
01:24:51,244 --> 01:24:55,425
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the meantime, let's go back to a more classic era of video games.

1183
01:24:55,945 --> 01:24:56,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I was really short.

1184
01:24:57,166 --> 01:25:02,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to when Zelda 2 was completely breaking the formula and some people hated it for that.

1185
01:25:02,988 --> 01:25:03,408
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1186
01:25:03,508 --> 01:25:04,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go earlier than that.

1187
01:25:04,928 --> 01:25:06,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go even earlier than that.

1188
01:25:06,829 --> 01:25:08,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to me being six years old.

1189
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.

1190
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:13,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this a game that was on like...

1191
01:25:14,406 --> 01:25:16,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to stand on a step stool to play it.

1192
01:25:17,811 --> 01:25:18,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it Pong?

1193
01:25:18,853 --> 01:25:19,173
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1194
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:20,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that old.

1195
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:21,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it Space War?

1196
01:25:21,677 --> 01:25:21,957
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1197
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:23,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl, please.

1198
01:25:23,559 --> 01:25:25,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, it's the classic game of the week.

1199
01:25:25,362 --> 01:25:30,209
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura's gonna jump into her gaming vault and pull a game out of her butt that she framed.

1200
01:25:31,738 --> 01:25:33,259
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's Kangaroo.

1201
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:35,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna jump right into it.

1202
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha.

1203
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:41,623
[SPEAKER_07]: It was done by Sun Electronics, distributed by Atari.

1204
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:46,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's sort of like a cross between Donkey Kong and Popeye.

1205
01:25:46,986 --> 01:25:50,828
[SPEAKER_07]: You basically play a mother kangaroo who has to rescue her baby, her little Joey.

1206
01:25:51,288 --> 01:25:54,930
[SPEAKER_07]: You go through the treetops and beat up monkeys.

1207
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:57,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not aware that there were monkeys in Australia.

1208
01:25:57,571 --> 01:25:58,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there monkeys in Australia?

1209
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:00,032
[SPEAKER_07]: There's kangaroos in Australia.

1210
01:26:00,673 --> 01:26:01,373
[SPEAKER_07]: But why are there monkeys?

1211
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:05,190
[SPEAKER_11]: They run the other direction.

1212
01:26:05,472 --> 01:26:05,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1213
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:11,503
[SPEAKER_07]: My thought is that they're really criminals because you know that's how Australia was started.

1214
01:26:11,523 --> 01:26:14,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and I know the Australians love it when you point that out, DarkSakura.

1215
01:26:16,366 --> 01:26:17,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're pink criminals.

1216
01:26:18,227 --> 01:26:19,287
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to go with that.

1217
01:26:19,327 --> 01:26:20,228
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my headcanon.

1218
01:26:20,288 --> 01:26:21,628
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot convince me otherwise.

1219
01:26:22,129 --> 01:26:33,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can punch apples and throw them at... They throw apples at you and you can punch them and you can knock down the monkeys with it.

1220
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:33,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1221
01:26:34,415 --> 01:26:38,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you go up ladders through trees to rescue your baby kangaroo.

1222
01:26:39,318 --> 01:26:47,864
[SPEAKER_07]: There are four different levels, and basically, like I said, you rescue the joey, and you get apples thrown at you, and you get to beat up the mean monkeys.

1223
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:53,248
[SPEAKER_07]: You can punch them with your boxing gloves, and you can punch the apples, and you can punch other fruit.

1224
01:26:53,288 --> 01:26:54,528
[SPEAKER_07]: You just go around punching shit.

1225
01:26:55,629 --> 01:27:00,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you have to be, um, watch out for the big ape who tries to take your gloves away.

1226
01:27:00,332 --> 01:27:02,333
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't punch him if you don't have boxing gloves.

1227
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:05,535
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would just think that a kangaroo could kick him in the face.

1228
01:27:06,175 --> 01:27:09,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I imagine that being kicked by a kangaroo would really freaking hurt.

1229
01:27:10,663 --> 01:27:30,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the third level is a different one, because the baby kangaroo is actually being held up by monkeys, and you get apples that basically get sent up on you for when you climb up there, so you have to punch the monkey several times until the cage is open.

1230
01:27:31,631 --> 01:27:32,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Punch the monkey.

1231
01:27:33,718 --> 01:27:34,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1232
01:27:48,759 --> 01:28:13,612
[SPEAKER_07]: and you have Westminster Quarters where the bell plays too and Marcia alla Turca which was well music inspired by that by Beethoven so anyway it came out on the Atari 2600 and the 5200 which I have both copies of the 5200 version is super good never play it with a trackball by the way because you will want to shoot yourself in the face

1233
01:28:15,177 --> 01:28:21,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Kangaroo was actually involved with the Saturday Supercade.

1234
01:28:21,181 --> 01:28:21,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember that, Rob?

1235
01:28:22,682 --> 01:28:23,222
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually do.

1236
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:23,222
1984.

1237
01:28:24,743 --> 01:28:28,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Kangaroo and Space Ace replaced Pitfall Harry, Frogger, and Donkey Kong Jr.

1238
01:28:28,586 --> 01:28:29,667
[SPEAKER_07]: for segments on that show.

1239
01:28:30,607 --> 01:28:44,897
[SPEAKER_07]: And so basically, the kangaroos were Katie and Joey, and they lived in a zoo run by Mr. Friendly, and they were friends with Sidney the Squirrel, and they had to fight the Monkey Biz gang.

1240
01:28:46,558 --> 01:28:47,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Which you know who... Oh, that's actually cool.

1241
01:28:47,998 --> 01:28:48,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know that.

1242
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:50,699
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the voices for one of the monkeys was Frank Welker.

1243
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,201
[SPEAKER_07]: They were Bingo, Bango, Bongo, and Fred.

1244
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:55,842
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually get this on DVD?

1245
01:28:55,882 --> 01:28:56,462
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

1246
01:28:56,482 --> 01:28:58,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to go get those on DVD.

1247
01:28:58,563 --> 01:28:59,563
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Kangaroo.

1248
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:01,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun game.

1249
01:29:02,925 --> 01:29:05,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, here's my background story on this one.

1250
01:29:06,226 --> 01:29:07,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine 1982.

1251
01:29:08,827 --> 01:29:09,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Six years old.

1252
01:29:10,068 --> 01:29:12,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in first grade.

1253
01:29:12,969 --> 01:29:14,250
[SPEAKER_07]: At Godfather's Pizza.

1254
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:21,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Neeling on this weird stool trying to play freaking kangaroo.

1255
01:29:22,898 --> 01:29:27,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kept running back for quarters because I was bound and determined to punch those damn monkeys.

1256
01:29:28,499 --> 01:29:29,720
[SPEAKER_07]: And I punched some monkeys.

1257
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us more about how you punch the monkeys.

1258
01:29:35,081 --> 01:29:36,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I punch monkeys all the time.

1259
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:40,482
[SPEAKER_07]: So they give a throwing poo and yanking it in the zoo.

1260
01:29:41,502 --> 01:29:43,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Monkeys are nasty little bastards.

1261
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I love monkeys.

1262
01:29:46,601 --> 01:29:47,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I love lemurs.

1263
01:29:49,442 --> 01:29:51,723
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone said, do you want a monkey or a lemur?

1264
01:29:51,883 --> 01:29:52,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I pick a lemur every time.

1265
01:29:54,124 --> 01:29:54,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a kangaroo.

1266
01:29:55,645 --> 01:29:58,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the hell that has to do with the game, but that's so funny.

1267
01:29:58,687 --> 01:29:59,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Monkeys!

1268
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:00,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Punching monkeys.

1269
01:30:00,468 --> 01:30:01,028
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.

1270
01:30:01,528 --> 01:30:04,310
[SPEAKER_11]: The punching monkey classic, Kangaroo.

1271
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:07,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Available in arcades everywhere.

1272
01:30:07,371 --> 01:30:08,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Punching monkeys.

1273
01:30:09,352 --> 01:30:11,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Look for it where you can punch your favorite monkeys.

1274
01:30:11,113 --> 01:30:13,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw posted up the intro to the kangaroo cartoon.

1275
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:14,735
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1276
01:30:15,495 --> 01:30:16,135
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

1277
01:30:16,295 --> 01:30:17,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing is as awesome as punching a monkey.

1278
01:30:19,517 --> 01:30:20,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I stand by my monkey punching.

1279
01:30:21,158 --> 01:30:23,379
[SPEAKER_11]: There's your classic game of the week.

1280
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:24,460
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I didn't say donkey.

1281
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I was waiting the whole time for you to make a donkey punch.

1282
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:28,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

1283
01:30:28,922 --> 01:30:30,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't going to say it, but I did anyway.

1284
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:35,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take a break, and DarkSakura's got to go punch a monkey or two.

1285
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:37,326
[SPEAKER_11]: When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1286
01:30:37,586 --> 01:30:38,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have monkeys?

1287
01:30:38,547 --> 01:30:40,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of responses to the Fugo question of the week.

1288
01:30:40,928 --> 01:30:42,328
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just a cat, and you can't punch her.

1289
01:30:42,389 --> 01:30:42,949
[SPEAKER_11]: She doesn't like that.

1290
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:45,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I will punch her by petting her.

1291
01:30:45,699 --> 01:30:47,242
[SPEAKER_11]: and the mailbag, maybe.

1292
01:30:47,342 --> 01:30:47,582
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1293
01:30:47,603 --> 01:30:49,246
[SPEAKER_11]: There were no emails in there this morning when I looked.

1294
01:30:49,286 --> 01:30:49,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

1295
01:30:49,687 --> 01:30:51,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, aw.

1296
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:55,759
[SPEAKER_11]: And your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.

1297
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:56,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay tuned.

1298
01:30:56,581 --> 01:30:56,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1299
01:31:03,766 --> 01:31:12,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi there, this is Captain Spike and First Mate Slagkick from GameBooey.org GameBooey.org And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1300
01:31:12,608 --> 01:31:18,829
[SPEAKER_14]: And we want to use our voice to tell you support indie broadcasting and congratulations to Orange Lounge Radio on 11 wonderful years.

1301
01:31:18,969 --> 01:31:19,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

1302
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:20,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

1303
01:31:21,169 --> 01:31:22,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

1304
01:31:22,969 --> 01:31:25,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Is my mic off?

1305
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:25,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1306
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:30,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to our friends at GameBooey.org for that bumper.

1307
01:31:30,911 --> 01:31:31,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate it.

1308
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:39,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes I wish we did a tape show like they did so that way I could cover up all those screw-ups when they happen like I don't have my mic on.

1309
01:31:41,633 --> 01:31:43,134
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the second time you've heard that bumper.

1310
01:31:43,194 --> 01:31:47,977
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because we're not getting any more bumpers from our listeners.

1311
01:31:48,197 --> 01:31:49,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Shame on all of you.

1312
01:31:49,278 --> 01:31:50,899
[SPEAKER_11]: So you should definitely send us some.

1313
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:57,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Check the forums over at vognetwork.com and you can send us a bumper and you can tell us whatever you want.

1314
01:31:57,703 --> 01:32:00,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Use your voice here on the program to tell us whatever you want.

1315
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:05,228
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of people giving their voices to the Fugle Question of the Week here in a little bit.

1316
01:32:05,288 --> 01:32:06,289
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll play that.

1317
01:32:07,169 --> 01:32:08,790
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get to that in a little bit here.

1318
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:12,133
[SPEAKER_11]: But first, we have some rapid-fire news we've got to go over.

1319
01:32:13,073 --> 01:32:13,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1320
01:32:14,774 --> 01:32:15,155
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1321
01:32:15,595 --> 01:32:21,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's talk a little bit about the awesome game that is Saints Row 4.

1322
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:28,684
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is some wonderful news that came out from a panel at Comic-Con, actually.

1323
01:32:29,204 --> 01:32:45,499
[SPEAKER_12]: and they were talking a little bit about some of the scrapped ideas that they had originally the end of the game was going to have a Bollywood dance number which that's awesome outstanding the only problem was it wasn't possible for them to do that because of the cost

1324
01:32:46,499 --> 01:33:05,391
[SPEAKER_12]: by the time they figured out which Bollywood song to license and also doing all the choreography and stuff like that and the motion capture it was just going to be too much so they just couldn't end up doing that although I'm sure the ending of the game is going to be awesome

1325
01:33:05,931 --> 01:33:08,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, though, they said that there's some really interesting details in the game.

1326
01:33:08,933 --> 01:33:14,195
[SPEAKER_12]: They're kind of calling it, they're joking that the Saints Rose about the arts.

1327
01:33:14,615 --> 01:33:31,324
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess they have one of the in-game radio stations where the evil alien guy, Zinyak, he's actually reading a bunch of different classical literature, including monologues from Shakespeare and even the entire first chapter of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.

1328
01:33:33,163 --> 01:33:35,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Spoiler alert, I will not be listening to that station.

1329
01:33:36,285 --> 01:33:40,888
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be listening to the dubstep dance electronica station, as I always do.

1330
01:33:41,269 --> 01:33:46,952
[SPEAKER_12]: And probably flipping between that and the 80s station, because I hear the 80s station is pretty awesome.

1331
01:33:46,992 --> 01:33:49,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Will you listen to your dubstep while you use your dubstep gun?

1332
01:33:49,474 --> 01:33:50,114
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1333
01:33:50,235 --> 01:33:52,736
[SPEAKER_11]: And chew your dubstep gum?

1334
01:33:53,036 --> 01:33:55,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Assuming that I can fire that out the window, yes.

1335
01:33:56,098 --> 01:33:57,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Most likely, no.

1336
01:33:58,700 --> 01:33:58,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Amazing.

1337
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe this.

1338
01:34:00,697 --> 01:34:01,278
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't wait.

1339
01:34:01,658 --> 01:34:02,899
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not much longer now, right?

1340
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:03,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

1341
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,141
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting to that point of the year.

1342
01:34:05,201 --> 01:34:05,962
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting closer.

1343
01:34:06,982 --> 01:34:07,563
[SPEAKER_11]: What is today?

1344
01:34:07,663 --> 01:34:10,625
[SPEAKER_11]: July 21st.

1345
01:34:10,766 --> 01:34:15,810
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like five weeks away from Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, just saying.

1346
01:34:16,069 --> 01:34:18,051
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be a tight schedule, so that's all good.

1347
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:21,735
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so I guess here's a positive.

1348
01:34:22,015 --> 01:34:33,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Xbox One is also going to support partial download support, or I should say partial download play, meaning that while a game is being downloaded, you will be able to play the game thanks to the cloud.

1349
01:34:36,909 --> 01:34:37,850
[SPEAKER_11]: When the cloud works.

1350
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:38,590
[SPEAKER_11]: When the cloud works.

1351
01:34:39,551 --> 01:34:46,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy 7 is in the indication, though granted the servers are not even run by the same company, but I'm just saying.

1352
01:34:46,996 --> 01:34:52,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps you have to level up Cloud so that he has his limit break, and limit break is cloud saving.

1353
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,541
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you get the limit break at level 1.

1354
01:34:53,701 --> 01:34:55,362
[SPEAKER_11]: You get to use limit breaks at the beginning of the game.

1355
01:34:55,822 --> 01:34:56,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Where have you been?

1356
01:34:57,629 --> 01:35:00,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's try to limit break.

1357
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:01,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh, troll comment in our chatroom.

1358
01:35:02,632 --> 01:35:05,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really, but live.vognetwork.com, I'm going to read it anyway.

1359
01:35:05,734 --> 01:35:10,476
[SPEAKER_11]: MaskedBishop in our chatroom says, I'm still trying to figure out the selling point of the Saints Row series.

1360
01:35:11,056 --> 01:35:11,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki?

1361
01:35:12,557 --> 01:35:13,878
[SPEAKER_12]: It depends which one you're talking about.

1362
01:35:13,898 --> 01:35:16,119
[SPEAKER_12]: The original Saints Row games were kind of like a Grand Theft Auto.

1363
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:22,743
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, Saints Row 1 for me was, hey, Grand Theft Auto is on the Xbox 360, I'm going to play this game, and it was fun.

1364
01:35:23,563 --> 01:35:29,125
[SPEAKER_12]: I think kind of the last few games it's just been so over the top and ridiculous that it's entertaining.

1365
01:35:29,985 --> 01:35:35,968
[SPEAKER_12]: And Bobby is informing me, yes, you can listen to the radio anytime because it's cyberspace and the radio stations are injected directly into your brain.

1366
01:35:36,388 --> 01:35:36,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

1367
01:35:36,668 --> 01:35:41,109
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, you can listen to the dubstep while firing a dubstep gun.

1368
01:35:41,129 --> 01:35:41,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray.

1369
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:43,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let me say this.

1370
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:45,111
[SPEAKER_11]: In my experience with at least Saints Row 3...

1371
01:35:45,911 --> 01:36:04,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Saint's Row is good for the same reason that This Is The End was good it's fucking ridiculous and dumb as hell but you can't help but laugh like it's just over the top stupid it's beyond over the top yeah like and some of the things in that movie were just ridiculous but I laughed like it was so funny

1372
01:36:04,344 --> 01:36:05,305
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not true.

1373
01:36:05,405 --> 01:36:10,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Grand Theft Auto is trying to take itself kind of like an Oscar movie, I guess, where it's very well done.

1374
01:36:11,109 --> 01:36:13,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Grand Theft Auto is a little ridiculous in itself.

1375
01:36:13,451 --> 01:36:24,120
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a little ridiculous, but they're definitely going along the lines of realism, like the amount of detail that they have in the game with the whole stock markets and just all the stuff you can do in the game.

1376
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:30,665
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going one way with Grand Theft Auto, whereas Saints Row is kind of going the complete opposite direction.

1377
01:36:30,725 --> 01:36:33,307
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just like, hey, you know what would be fun is if we have superpowers.

1378
01:36:33,427 --> 01:36:34,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going to explain it?

1379
01:36:34,327 --> 01:36:34,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Eh, whatever.

1380
01:36:34,847 --> 01:36:36,168
[SPEAKER_12]: He's in the Matrix now.

1381
01:36:36,228 --> 01:36:37,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, they're done.

1382
01:36:37,188 --> 01:36:37,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sweet.

1383
01:36:38,909 --> 01:36:40,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, we were going to have a gun that fires dubstep.

1384
01:36:41,949 --> 01:36:42,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

1385
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:43,330
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just ridiculous.

1386
01:36:43,390 --> 01:36:44,370
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to be ridiculous.

1387
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,951
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the whole point.

1388
01:36:46,991 --> 01:36:50,112
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if that's the type of game you want to play, then play Saints Row.

1389
01:36:50,292 --> 01:36:52,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I honestly think you should play both because they're both awesome.

1390
01:36:53,573 --> 01:36:55,393
[SPEAKER_12]: I will be playing both a lot.

1391
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:58,474
[SPEAKER_12]: So much so that I'm probably not going to get PlayStation 4 now.

1392
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:14,547
[SPEAKER_11]: BlackWolf and TimTrip are having a conversation in our chatroom about it and BlackWolf says Tim, Saints Row 4 is basically Grand Theft Auto meets Crackdown meets over-the-top humor especially with their version of the Crackdown orbs Oh, Alan's here to give comment Hi Alan

1393
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:29,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, just want to say, because I beat Grand Theft Auto 4 all the way through just a couple weeks ago, after the insanity of GTA 3 San Andreas, which there was a lot of crazy stuff in that, a lot of people thought that 4 proper with Nico Bellic was too dry.

1394
01:37:29,221 --> 01:37:32,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very bleak and just super serious.

1395
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:34,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, did you play through the ballad of Gay Tony?

1396
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:37,932
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm only, like, an hour into Lost and Damned.

1397
01:37:37,992 --> 01:37:42,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, yeah, when you get to Valley of Daytona, it's kind of like they're trying to bring it back towards San Andreas.

1398
01:37:42,614 --> 01:37:47,097
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, honestly, that was, like, the best as far as, like, playing with the weapon set and stuff like that.

1399
01:37:47,177 --> 01:37:47,677
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the best.

1400
01:37:47,757 --> 01:37:58,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I guess you can tell already from the gameplay trailer for 5 that they realize that they don't want to turn the dial up to Saints Row crazy, but they need to have more over-the-top...

1401
01:37:58,923 --> 01:38:00,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff in it, I think.

1402
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:04,105
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just giving you more freedom without going crazy with the stuff that's in there.

1403
01:38:04,145 --> 01:38:05,526
[SPEAKER_04]: In San Andreas, wasn't there like a big wheel?

1404
01:38:05,826 --> 01:38:07,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it wasn't mod, you could just drive a big wheel around?

1405
01:38:09,547 --> 01:38:10,487
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember.

1406
01:38:10,788 --> 01:38:11,308
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while.

1407
01:38:11,348 --> 01:38:16,750
[SPEAKER_04]: You could like parachute off buildings, a lot of crazy stuff, and then 4 was very, very bleak.

1408
01:38:19,236 --> 01:38:23,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Captain Spike in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Eh, I want games to be fun.

1409
01:38:23,578 --> 01:38:24,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Games and all.

1410
01:38:24,318 --> 01:38:26,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really here for Grand Theft Auto's fourth story.

1411
01:38:26,578 --> 01:38:28,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Wants to be an Oscar-winning movie bullshit or whatever.

1412
01:38:28,939 --> 01:38:29,519
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fun.

1413
01:38:29,599 --> 01:38:31,080
[SPEAKER_11]: You just don't play the main storyline.

1414
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:31,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares?

1415
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:36,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Once in a while, I'm okay with Oscar-worthy video games, though.

1416
01:38:36,182 --> 01:38:37,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, Journey is like a Night of the Mets, right?

1417
01:38:37,962 --> 01:38:39,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, Saints Row the Third is fun.

1418
01:38:39,643 --> 01:38:40,303
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty fun.

1419
01:38:41,244 --> 01:38:48,448
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a little bit of repetition when it comes to some of the activities and stuff, but I think Saints Row III was fun, and Saints Row II was actually pretty fun.

1420
01:38:48,549 --> 01:38:51,030
[SPEAKER_12]: So Saints Row IV sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun too.

1421
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:51,971
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's move on.

1422
01:38:51,991 --> 01:38:52,791
[SPEAKER_11]: We got derailed a little bit.

1423
01:38:52,811 --> 01:38:53,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you just say your thing?

1424
01:38:53,892 --> 01:38:54,993
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I haven't done that yet.

1425
01:38:55,733 --> 01:39:03,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Last but not least, they're trying to bring back sort of a spiritual successor to Police Quest.

1426
01:39:04,119 --> 01:39:06,201
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually being done by the same creator.

1427
01:39:07,281 --> 01:39:14,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Robert Lindsley is trying to kickstart a game called Precinct.

1428
01:39:15,427 --> 01:39:18,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, their funding goal is half a million dollars.

1429
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:24,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, the game is going to be very similar to...

1430
01:39:25,974 --> 01:39:51,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess the police quest series and if you're looking to get a game similar to that then maybe you should try backing this right now as a recording they are up to $50,000 probably actually close to $51,000 still a ways away from their goal but they have 25 days left so there is a chance and some of the concept art looks actually pretty sweet it's all like first person you have like the patrol view and stuff like that looks like it could be pretty cool

1431
01:39:54,548 --> 01:39:59,771
[SPEAKER_12]: and I like their precinct funding chart here they said our campaign 500,000 awesome 600,000 awesomer 700,000 mega awesome 800,000 plus badonk

1432
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:17,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well hopefully this movie will be pretty badonk, but the first signs of the World of Warcraft movie was shown at Comic-Con.

1433
01:40:17,482 --> 01:40:19,803
[SPEAKER_11]: The teaser trailer unveiled at Comic-Con.

1434
01:40:20,083 --> 01:40:29,206
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the thing, the movie doesn't have any stars attached yet, so there wasn't really a lot to show, but the teaser did have a mix of live action and computer generated effects.

1435
01:40:29,986 --> 01:40:37,509
[SPEAKER_11]: It was out in a desert field and had an armored human warrior that drank a potion and then drew a sword just before battling a hammer wielding orc.

1436
01:40:38,489 --> 01:40:46,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, as we all know, Duncan Jones, who did Source Code and Moon, and also importantly is David Bowie's son, is helming the Warcraft film.

1437
01:40:47,274 --> 01:40:49,175
[SPEAKER_11]: It's supposed to begin shooting in early 2014.

1438
01:40:49,715 --> 01:40:52,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming that means released in probably 2015.

1439
01:40:53,758 --> 01:40:57,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Can Bowie get like a monarch position in the movie?

1440
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,301
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love that.

1441
01:40:59,461 --> 01:41:01,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps the king of the goblins?

1442
01:41:01,582 --> 01:41:07,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the reason why he goes by the name Duncan Jones is he doesn't want to be in the shadow of his dad, though.

1443
01:41:07,927 --> 01:41:12,871
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would really, really be surprised if David Bowie turns up in this at all.

1444
01:41:13,152 --> 01:41:16,394
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe he can do a little dance magic dance.

1445
01:41:17,495 --> 01:41:21,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, by the way, this clip is not on the internet for us to see.

1446
01:41:21,217 --> 01:41:22,658
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it leaked out to YouTube.

1447
01:41:22,678 --> 01:41:23,679
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it's out there somewhere.

1448
01:41:24,019 --> 01:41:39,889
[SPEAKER_11]: But Blizzard has said there is no plans to release the mood piece that was shown at Comic-Con that was only for Comic-Con and not for public consumption, which I'm actually okay with because, again, it's not real footage from the movie, so to speak, because there's no stars attached yet or anything.

1449
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:40,149
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1450
01:41:40,949 --> 01:41:42,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting though that it's a human versus an orc.

1451
01:41:44,272 --> 01:41:46,313
[SPEAKER_11]: The movie is also just called Warcraft.

1452
01:41:46,494 --> 01:41:47,915
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not called World of Warcraft.

1453
01:41:48,195 --> 01:41:49,936
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm wondering if they're taking it way back.

1454
01:41:50,356 --> 01:41:54,820
[SPEAKER_11]: They might be taking the story way back to the original humans versus orcs story, which is alright.

1455
01:41:56,144 --> 01:41:57,706
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to all be about Sylvanas and that's it

1456
01:42:17,488 --> 01:42:24,310
[SPEAKER_11]: If you would like to have your voice featured in the game as a Madonkan, you can be in the remake there.

1457
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:32,973
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to record in a microphone there a few phrases, and you make a SoundCloud account, make sure things sound fine, don't have a lot of feedback in the background or whatever.

1458
01:42:33,553 --> 01:42:38,915
[SPEAKER_11]: It's over on the official blog, oddworld.com, and you have to get those in by Friday, July 26th.

1459
01:42:39,815 --> 01:42:41,335
[SPEAKER_11]: But you could have your voice featured in the game.

1460
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:42,456
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if I should send something in.

1461
01:42:42,496 --> 01:42:43,256
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that might be fun.

1462
01:42:43,636 --> 01:42:45,136
[SPEAKER_11]: I could use the recording equipment here.

1463
01:42:45,896 --> 01:42:48,737
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to say such things as, wait, I'm pulling up the blog here.

1464
01:42:49,117 --> 01:42:52,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the, like, it was very simple stuff.

1465
01:42:52,898 --> 01:42:56,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of it was like, ow, og, you know, things like that.

1466
01:42:57,739 --> 01:42:59,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, which of course now it's not coming up.

1467
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:03,601
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyhow, let me try one more time.

1468
01:43:03,841 --> 01:43:05,261
[SPEAKER_11]: This link here might show it.

1469
01:43:07,731 --> 01:43:08,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Live radio, of course.

1470
01:43:08,911 --> 01:43:09,311
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

1471
01:43:10,672 --> 01:43:24,194
[SPEAKER_11]: The words to say are hello, okay, laughing, giggling, angry, hissing, pain grunts, death screams, and bonus points for providing some sound effects for the wildlife of Mudos, birds, scarabs, elumes, etc.

1472
01:43:26,134 --> 01:43:31,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Just get on the microphone and make strange noises because somebody's going to have to listen to it.

1473
01:43:34,596 --> 01:43:35,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Is your mic not on, DarkSakura?

1474
01:43:35,756 --> 01:43:36,916
[SPEAKER_11]: The chat room's bitching.

1475
01:43:38,638 --> 01:43:39,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you were muted.

1476
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn it, Rob!

1477
01:43:40,862 --> 01:43:43,306
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

1478
01:43:43,326 --> 01:43:44,388
[SPEAKER_11]: That's totally my bad.

1479
01:43:44,408 --> 01:43:45,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

1480
01:43:45,329 --> 01:43:46,331
[SPEAKER_07]: That was not awesome.

1481
01:43:46,351 --> 01:43:47,233
[SPEAKER_07]: That was lame!

1482
01:43:48,362 --> 01:43:50,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Boy, we're all sorts of broken here at OLR tonight.

1483
01:43:50,504 --> 01:43:50,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.

1484
01:43:51,965 --> 01:43:55,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, okay, DarkSakura, I have a new story to make it all better, okay?

1485
01:43:56,069 --> 01:43:56,470
[SPEAKER_11]: It better.

1486
01:43:56,670 --> 01:43:57,731
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so here's the deal.

1487
01:43:58,151 --> 01:44:02,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Capcom working on what they're calling a major IP for the Nintendo 3DS.

1488
01:44:02,495 --> 01:44:04,077
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Geist Crusher.

1489
01:44:04,517 --> 01:44:09,622
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a multiplayer game where you're going to fight monsters known as Geists, or G-A-I-S-T-S, Geists.

1490
01:44:10,243 --> 01:44:10,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing, though.

1491
01:44:10,963 --> 01:44:13,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Geist Crusher, co-developed by Treasure.

1492
01:44:13,826 --> 01:44:25,055
[SPEAKER_11]: so there you go the announcements on Treasure's website treasure-inc.co.jp so Capcom and Treasure are coming together for this so did that make it a little better?

1493
01:44:26,256 --> 01:44:41,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be a little tingly alright then why don't you do some news with your now newly on mic yeah thanks Rob well in other news it's actually not pulling up great oh yeah Valve

1494
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they will not give us a Half-Life 3 yet.

1495
01:44:47,641 --> 01:44:49,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they don't love you.

1496
01:44:50,821 --> 01:44:51,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they don't love somebody.

1497
01:44:54,562 --> 01:45:02,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So, they are actually working with the modding community.

1498
01:45:02,703 --> 01:45:09,405
[SPEAKER_07]: So, they're basically... Come on, thing.

1499
01:45:09,465 --> 01:45:11,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, it's my iPad being stupid.

1500
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:23,836
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, they are doing the Half-Life campaign as a co-op, and it's going to be put on for free, and it's going to be available through Steam.

1501
01:45:24,897 --> 01:45:26,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is at least something new, right?

1502
01:45:27,858 --> 01:45:31,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the Sven co-op as a standalone game.

1503
01:45:33,726 --> 01:45:50,050
[SPEAKER_07]: and other news, this makes me super happy there's an Adventure Time game it's actually going to be out in the fall on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U and 3DS and it's called Adventure Time, explore the dungeon because I don't know

1504
01:45:52,381 --> 01:45:54,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Stan Lee Howard the Duck

1505
01:46:11,903 --> 01:46:12,784
[SPEAKER_07]: and Squirrel Girl.

1506
01:46:13,384 --> 01:46:19,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Squirrel Girl because she kicked the crap out of Thanos and Doctor Doom and did it legit through the power of squirrels.

1507
01:46:20,488 --> 01:46:23,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, also included there's Doctor Doom, Jean Grey.

1508
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:25,191
[SPEAKER_11]: What exactly is the power of squirrels?

1509
01:46:25,652 --> 01:46:26,532
[SPEAKER_07]: She talks to squirrels.

1510
01:46:26,712 --> 01:46:28,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Her power is control of squirrels.

1511
01:46:28,633 --> 01:46:34,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And she can speak squirrel language and she also has sharp teeth and little claws and a big bushy tail and she can climb up trees.

1512
01:46:35,959 --> 01:46:37,820
[SPEAKER_07]: She also can kick anybody's ass.

1513
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:40,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Squirrel Girl cannot be defeated by anybody.

1514
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:42,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's also Jessica Jones' nanny.

1515
01:46:42,801 --> 01:46:43,821
[SPEAKER_07]: So that makes her super cool.

1516
01:46:45,722 --> 01:46:57,886
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, also confirmed as Doctor Doom, Jean Grey, Elektra, Magneto, Silver Samurai, Punisher, Beast, Gambit, Storm, Green Goblin, Juggernaut, Rhino, The Thing, Vulture, Sabretooth, and Invisible Woman.

1517
01:46:58,746 --> 01:47:02,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So we also will have Coulson in the game.

1518
01:47:04,352 --> 01:47:08,195
[SPEAKER_07]: and you have a pre-order exclusive of the Iron Patriot and Deadpool.

1519
01:47:09,657 --> 01:47:10,357
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

1520
01:47:12,579 --> 01:47:17,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week, which, oh my gosh, this is one of the most popular ones we've ever asked.

1521
01:47:18,004 --> 01:47:19,285
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many answers this week.

1522
01:47:19,365 --> 01:47:20,006
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what to do.

1523
01:47:20,086 --> 01:47:22,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1524
01:47:28,487 --> 01:47:32,470
[SPEAKER_11]: You take Facebook and Google, you slam them together, you get Foogle.

1525
01:47:32,711 --> 01:47:36,954
[SPEAKER_11]: And we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities every week here on the show.

1526
01:47:37,695 --> 01:47:38,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's Foogle.

1527
01:47:39,356 --> 01:47:44,840
[SPEAKER_11]: And I knew the news about Strider was going to make DarkSakura very happy.

1528
01:47:45,141 --> 01:47:47,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dan, we talked about that in Part A. I feel all squishy now.

1529
01:47:48,143 --> 01:48:17,531
[SPEAKER_11]: so I wanted to ask a similar question of the listeners tonight with a Google question of the week and that is what long dormant series would you like to see make a comeback and I said listeners you only get to pick one to try and keep the answers a little bit short tonight there are alone like 23 answers on Facebook should I read them all that's a lot do it I'm going to read them all quickly I'm only going to read like little bits and pieces if I don't read the entire answer I'm sorry you'll just have to go read them for yourself facebook.com slash orange launch radio or google plus community

1530
01:48:17,731 --> 01:48:18,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

1531
01:48:18,371 --> 01:48:18,552
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1532
01:48:18,772 --> 01:48:19,512
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not really sorry.

1533
01:48:19,712 --> 01:48:20,573
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1534
01:48:20,613 --> 01:48:23,034
[SPEAKER_11]: VxChaseNyxV says, Bust a groove.

1535
01:48:23,695 --> 01:48:27,937
[SPEAKER_11]: But this also means it would probably end up a Kinect Move or Wiimote dancing game.

1536
01:48:27,957 --> 01:48:28,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Bust a move.

1537
01:48:29,218 --> 01:48:29,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Move.

1538
01:48:30,119 --> 01:48:32,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it depends what country.

1539
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,001
[SPEAKER_11]: UnfoldedRaptor says, A new Gex game.

1540
01:48:35,362 --> 01:48:37,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if it's not Gex 4, just a really nice reboot.

1541
01:48:38,724 --> 01:48:39,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that'd be fun.

1542
01:48:39,984 --> 01:48:45,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob himself says, A remake of California games because he played that to death on the Sega Master System along with Strider.

1543
01:48:47,671 --> 01:49:04,149
[SPEAKER_11]: James S says I want a new entry to the Soul Blazer saga but I'd settle for a remastered Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia Terra Enigma trilogy for my 3DS that is a fucking great answer I'll have you know I would love that too Jeremy J our buddy from Koopa Club says Mega Man

1544
01:49:05,273 --> 01:49:21,891
[SPEAKER_11]: see here's the thing with Mega Man though is that although Capcom has been real they've just been dicks about it to an extent like at least there was Mega Man 9 and 10 and those weren't that long ago all things considered and the Mega Man and Smash Brothers thing now I

1545
01:49:22,111 --> 01:49:36,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I admit, I as much as the next person would like to see a new, you know, 3D Mega Man Legends or just like a Mega Man 11 in the 2-bit style or, you know, kind of like a 2.5D kind of Mega Man game I think would be awesome, especially maybe on like the Wii U or something, but I don't know.

1546
01:49:37,005 --> 01:49:46,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Mega Man's not as, it hasn't been as horribly long for Mega Man yet as some other games I can think of like on the Nintendo and so forth, but.

1547
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:47,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1548
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,141
[SPEAKER_13]: The Guardian Legend.

1549
01:49:49,161 --> 01:49:50,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously?

1550
01:49:51,121 --> 01:49:56,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anybody answered Guardian Legend to which I say All of these people are wrong.

1551
01:49:56,103 --> 01:49:58,443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unfortunate that all of our listeners had to be wrong tonight.

1552
01:50:00,484 --> 01:50:03,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaming Nerd said a new Alex Kidd game.

1553
01:50:03,465 --> 01:50:07,086
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been featured in Sega Collections but never a new game or a remake of his own.

1554
01:50:07,426 --> 01:50:09,206
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be nice to see Alex Kidd come back, wouldn't it?

1555
01:50:10,146 --> 01:50:15,488
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Rama S says one of the most underrated and underappreciated fighting games, Rival Schools.

1556
01:50:16,536 --> 01:50:17,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I love rival schools.

1557
01:50:17,576 --> 01:50:18,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Zether says, Gradius.

1558
01:50:19,137 --> 01:50:21,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami's kept it locked up for far too long.

1559
01:50:21,737 --> 01:50:23,538
[SPEAKER_07]: But didn't we have Gradius 5 just a few years ago?

1560
01:50:24,598 --> 01:50:26,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it really that, not that long ago?

1561
01:50:26,219 --> 01:50:27,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was that long ago.

1562
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:31,340
[SPEAKER_11]: William Murderface says, A sequel to Darkwatch.

1563
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:33,581
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be Halo, but with vampire cowboys.

1564
01:50:34,421 --> 01:50:34,941
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be cool.

1565
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:39,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Fifth Dream says, I was talking about Section Z and would love to see it make a comeback.

1566
01:50:40,723 --> 01:50:43,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Kareem J says, Streets of Rage 4.

1567
01:50:43,784 --> 01:50:44,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

1568
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:48,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Loco Poco says, I'd love to see an Illbleed sequel.

1569
01:50:48,544 --> 01:50:50,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a great mixture of horror and camp.

1570
01:50:52,192 --> 01:50:54,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Nikki E says, Streets of Rage.

1571
01:50:54,474 --> 01:50:56,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I still keep coming back to that game series.

1572
01:50:56,635 --> 01:50:58,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Codeman says, Mega Man Legends.

1573
01:50:59,217 --> 01:51:04,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Rich B says, not really a series, but I've always wanted to see a follow-up to Midnight Resistance on the Sega Genesis.

1574
01:51:04,741 --> 01:51:05,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Midnight Resistance is a good game.

1575
01:51:06,162 --> 01:51:06,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it'll be.

1576
01:51:07,624 --> 01:51:10,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially something kind of like really off the radar like that.

1577
01:51:10,606 --> 01:51:11,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they don't ever have like one game.

1578
01:51:11,486 --> 01:51:12,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they've done it for Classic.

1579
01:51:12,847 --> 01:51:13,928
[SPEAKER_11]: You probably have at some point.

1580
01:51:14,949 --> 01:51:16,090
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, I mean, you know, they're...

1581
01:51:17,031 --> 01:51:22,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Like he said in the answer, there was never a series there, just one really good game that we want to see something else with.

1582
01:51:23,637 --> 01:51:29,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Ragenator says, Samurai Showdown series, provided that an update stays true to the original five games, 2Ds and Pixels.

1583
01:51:30,123 --> 01:51:34,187
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually said that they were completely closing the series off after five, so I don't think that's happening.

1584
01:51:34,287 --> 01:51:34,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Bastards.

1585
01:51:35,308 --> 01:51:36,229
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll open it back up.

1586
01:51:38,531 --> 01:51:38,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1587
01:51:39,312 --> 01:51:40,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Edgar R. says, a new duck hunt.

1588
01:51:42,352 --> 01:51:43,513
[SPEAKER_11]: This time, the dog dies.

1589
01:51:44,674 --> 01:51:48,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Gamer Girl says, even though this isn't a series, I'd love to see Kid Chameleon.

1590
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:48,859
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that game.

1591
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:49,760
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good pick.

1592
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:52,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Chiggers says, Altered Beast.

1593
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:54,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, make it better this time, too.

1594
01:51:55,746 --> 01:51:57,848
[SPEAKER_11]: K&IM says, Secret of Evermore.

1595
01:51:58,269 --> 01:52:02,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be happy if they released it again on anything, but Square doesn't want my money, evidently.

1596
01:52:02,313 --> 01:52:09,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Secret of Evermore kind of gets crapped on because it was the Square USA title and it wasn't really part of the second Detsetsu series.

1597
01:52:09,023 --> 01:52:12,167
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like a spinoff, but Secret of Evermore had some neat stuff about it.

1598
01:52:12,448 --> 01:52:18,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know that that was one of the first soundtracks that, what's his name, Jeremy Soule, that guy that does the soundtracks for Elder Scrolls and stuff?

1599
01:52:18,918 --> 01:52:20,199
[SPEAKER_11]: He did the soundtrack for Secret of Evermore.

1600
01:52:20,219 --> 01:52:21,219
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of his first games ever.

1601
01:52:21,259 --> 01:52:22,520
[SPEAKER_11]: He was probably like 19 when he did it.

1602
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:23,300
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that game?

1603
01:52:24,421 --> 01:52:31,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Secret of Evermore was really shit on when it first came out, but I think Time has treated it well.

1604
01:52:31,925 --> 01:52:35,046
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't as bad as everybody made it out to be at the time.

1605
01:52:35,126 --> 01:52:40,389
[SPEAKER_11]: It just wasn't a Seiken Detsetsu game, really, even though they kind of tried to make it one.

1606
01:52:41,409 --> 01:52:46,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Peker Uno says, it would have to be the platform that got me into gaming in the first place.

1607
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:48,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Commander Keen would have to be 2D though.

1608
01:52:49,977 --> 01:52:56,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, DarkTetsuya says, with the resurrection and Capcom Arcade cabinet, how about a sequel or something to Black Dragon slash Black Tiger?

1609
01:52:57,023 --> 01:53:00,566
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say Magic Sword was a sequel to it, but there hasn't been another one since that.

1610
01:53:00,947 --> 01:53:02,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they could implement Oculus Rift support.

1611
01:53:02,988 --> 01:53:03,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha ha.

1612
01:53:05,010 --> 01:53:06,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim Tripp says, Free Space?

1613
01:53:07,331 --> 01:53:10,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd just like to see the return of the epic space combat genre.

1614
01:53:11,672 --> 01:53:13,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Anomalous Underdog says, Vagrant Story.

1615
01:53:14,053 --> 01:53:15,194
[SPEAKER_11]: I even thought of a name for it.

1616
01:53:15,354 --> 01:53:16,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Vagrant Army.

1617
01:53:16,594 --> 01:53:19,215
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we used to call that Fragrant Story because it stinks.

1618
01:53:20,216 --> 01:53:22,837
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know it's not bad, but that was the joke at my house.

1619
01:53:23,326 --> 01:53:24,527
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt says, really?

1620
01:53:24,587 --> 01:53:26,548
[SPEAKER_11]: No one's going to say Chrono Trigger or Chrono Cross?

1621
01:53:26,588 --> 01:53:27,389
[SPEAKER_11]: It's long overdue.

1622
01:53:28,830 --> 01:53:38,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Slidekick says, with the upcoming release of DuckTales Remastered, I'd love to see the return of more of Capcom's classic Disney platformers, like a modern tale on the adventures in the Magic Kingdom.

1623
01:53:39,296 --> 01:53:44,199
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fun blend of different games with a flawless Disney theme, and I think a new version would even be more immersive.

1624
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:49,783
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as it was more like Nintendo Land and not so much like Kinect Disneyland Adventures, which was sadly a big flop.

1625
01:53:50,163 --> 01:53:54,685
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the thing, though, is that Connect Disneyland Adventures kind of was Adventures in the Magic Kingdom.

1626
01:53:55,085 --> 01:53:58,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they really were the same type of thing.

1627
01:53:58,486 --> 01:54:01,667
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that Magic Kingdom was out when you were a kid.

1628
01:54:02,247 --> 01:54:06,589
[SPEAKER_11]: So it held up a little better than Connect Disneyland Adventures did, I think.

1629
01:54:08,049 --> 01:54:11,691
[SPEAKER_11]: and lastly on Facebook Shane says Rising Zan.

1630
01:54:11,951 --> 01:54:17,994
[SPEAKER_11]: It will leave you with a theme and I'll leave you with a theme song because that should be enough to spike some second hand sales of the game.

1631
01:54:18,354 --> 01:54:19,515
[SPEAKER_11]: How can anyone not love this?

1632
01:54:19,595 --> 01:54:20,775
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a ninja cowboy.

1633
01:54:23,197 --> 01:54:24,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Rising Zan was a fun game.

1634
01:54:24,617 --> 01:54:29,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And came back home with the heart of a gunman and the soul of a samurai.

1635
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:30,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me skip ahead a bit.

1636
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:34,202
[SPEAKER_06]: His name would learn the Shogun way of life.

1637
01:54:34,262 --> 01:54:35,743
[SPEAKER_09]: The blue eyes of the sun.

1638
01:54:37,887 --> 01:54:38,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Bizz Pokemon Snap

1639
01:54:54,727 --> 01:54:56,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Travis H says Shining Force.

1640
01:54:57,349 --> 01:54:58,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, this is a good answer.

1641
01:54:58,689 --> 01:55:00,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft says Uniracers.

1642
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:01,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was awesome.

1643
01:55:01,751 --> 01:55:02,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord, no.

1644
01:55:02,492 --> 01:55:02,732
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1645
01:55:03,252 --> 01:55:04,453
[SPEAKER_01]: That game pissed me off so much.

1646
01:55:04,473 --> 01:55:04,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Get out.

1647
01:55:05,514 --> 01:55:06,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I was so good at that game.

1648
01:55:06,874 --> 01:55:08,215
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what was kind of a sequel?

1649
01:55:08,515 --> 01:55:10,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Uniracers was Excite Truck in a way.

1650
01:55:10,677 --> 01:55:13,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the same type of thing with the stunts and everything and midair and all that.

1651
01:55:13,779 --> 01:55:14,239
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit.

1652
01:55:14,359 --> 01:55:14,759
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit.

1653
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:16,000
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1654
01:55:16,826 --> 01:55:21,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of great answers, you guys, except you all failed for not mentioning the Guardian legend.

1655
01:55:21,747 --> 01:55:22,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Get out.

1656
01:55:22,327 --> 01:55:27,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, though, the Uniracer unicycle should come back as a Smash Bros.

1657
01:55:27,788 --> 01:55:28,548
[SPEAKER_12]: fighting character.

1658
01:55:28,648 --> 01:55:28,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1659
01:55:29,828 --> 01:55:30,688
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be pretty sweet.

1660
01:55:30,748 --> 01:55:32,249
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be awesome.

1661
01:55:32,269 --> 01:55:35,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I suppose if Sega can have Daytona cars fighting, then we can have a fighting unicycle.

1662
01:55:35,949 --> 01:55:36,449
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

1663
01:55:37,290 --> 01:55:42,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Or at least as like a power-up or something, like Princess Peach can ride the unicycle around and do tricks or something.

1664
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:42,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1665
01:55:43,111 --> 01:55:43,431
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1666
01:55:43,671 --> 01:55:44,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get back into some more news.

1667
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:45,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1668
01:55:45,931 --> 01:55:47,332
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1669
01:55:48,173 --> 01:55:52,357
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're doing this really interesting promotion, I guess.

1670
01:55:52,817 --> 01:55:56,000
[SPEAKER_12]: It's OUYA's $1 million Free the Games Fund.

1671
01:55:56,240 --> 01:56:01,005
[SPEAKER_12]: They're boosting Kickstarter games, or Kickstarted games, I guess.

1672
01:56:01,505 --> 01:56:03,347
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's going to happen is, I guess, between...

1673
01:56:03,727 --> 01:56:07,470
[SPEAKER_12]: August 9th and August 10th next year.

1674
01:56:09,092 --> 01:56:15,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess a game will qualify as long as it's achieved its minimum goal of $50,000.

1675
01:56:15,917 --> 01:56:20,120
[SPEAKER_12]: And Ouya will match the total raised up to $250,000.

1676
01:56:20,201 --> 01:56:30,489
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm guessing this is going to be quite limited if you're going to only have a million dollars to shuffle around and

1677
01:56:32,267 --> 01:56:34,849
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to pledge up to $250,000.

1678
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:50,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I guess the game will receive an additional $100,000 if it's one of the most successful Kickstarter projects to take part in the Free the Games program.

1679
01:56:51,460 --> 01:57:02,007
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that the trick with that, there is a big but, you need to have your game exclusive for the OUYA for six months.

1680
01:57:03,529 --> 01:57:07,477
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's the only drawback, I guess.

1681
01:57:07,517 --> 01:57:08,319
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cheating.

1682
01:57:10,783 --> 01:57:12,086
[SPEAKER_12]: But hey, free money, right?

1683
01:57:12,747 --> 01:57:13,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Money's good.

1684
01:57:15,430 --> 01:57:15,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1685
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:17,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Money is always good, of course.

1686
01:57:18,391 --> 01:57:22,071
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't they have to fix some of these other problems, like their customer service and so forth first?

1687
01:57:22,131 --> 01:57:23,352
[SPEAKER_12]: God, that's what I suggested.

1688
01:57:23,392 --> 01:57:27,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, hey, you know, the problem is that you don't have enough games on the system.

1689
01:57:27,832 --> 01:57:29,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Although more would be good.

1690
01:57:30,353 --> 01:57:33,394
[SPEAKER_12]: More would be good, but I don't think you're going to get... I mean, look at this.

1691
01:57:34,794 --> 01:57:40,415
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that games have budgets and stuff like that, and they can be quite expensive, especially if you have a team of people, but...

1692
01:57:42,170 --> 01:57:42,470
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1693
01:57:42,510 --> 01:57:47,455
[SPEAKER_12]: For an indie game, I would think $100,000 is quite a bit.

1694
01:57:47,835 --> 01:57:50,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially if you're talking a small team of people.

1695
01:57:51,796 --> 01:57:55,039
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a lot of money, I think.

1696
01:57:55,099 --> 01:58:04,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say if we're going to take the high end here, $250,000, so a total of half a million dollars for a game.

1697
01:58:04,667 --> 01:58:06,088
[SPEAKER_12]: That's quite a bit.

1698
01:58:06,949 --> 01:58:08,410
[SPEAKER_12]: It better be one hell of a good game.

1699
01:58:09,151 --> 01:58:15,096
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some pretty decent games on there right now, but I don't think any of them cost half a million dollars or even $100,000 to make.

1700
01:58:18,976 --> 01:58:26,000
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, moving on to a little quote about a spinoff for a very well-received game from this year.

1701
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:28,081
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to do with the Tomb Raider series.

1702
01:58:28,621 --> 01:58:31,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And Gail Simone, who is a comic book veteran.

1703
01:58:31,263 --> 01:58:32,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, no, she is awesome.

1704
01:58:33,164 --> 01:58:33,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah?

1705
01:58:33,944 --> 01:58:35,005
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of other stuff has she done?

1706
01:58:35,045 --> 01:58:35,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't follow comics.

1707
01:58:35,805 --> 01:58:39,267
[SPEAKER_07]: She's one of the only reasons I ever read anything DC on purpose.

1708
01:58:39,747 --> 01:58:43,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she did, what did she do?

1709
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:44,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Birds of Prey.

1710
01:58:45,491 --> 01:58:47,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, even I know what that is because that was a CW show.

1711
01:58:49,275 --> 01:58:54,559
[SPEAKER_07]: But she is probably one of the best female comic book writers out there.

1712
01:58:54,919 --> 01:58:55,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

1713
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:59,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, she's teaming up with publisher Dark Horse to work on a Tomb Raider comic.

1714
01:58:59,883 --> 01:59:02,225
[SPEAKER_11]: But what caught people's attention was this quote.

1715
01:59:02,265 --> 01:59:08,210
[SPEAKER_11]: She said, quote, In continuity, it will be a Tomb Raider canon and lead directly into the sequel.

1716
01:59:08,711 --> 01:59:09,992
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what got me excited.

1717
01:59:10,412 --> 01:59:12,414
[SPEAKER_11]: We get to be part of Lara Croft history.

1718
01:59:12,874 --> 01:59:13,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

1719
01:59:13,755 --> 01:59:19,301
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't announced a sequel to Tomb Raider, so this quote kind of grabbed people's attention.

1720
01:59:19,722 --> 01:59:23,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I mean, let's be real, it would make a lot of sense.

1721
01:59:23,526 --> 01:59:24,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you didn't expect a sequel.

1722
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, right?

1723
01:59:25,589 --> 01:59:26,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the game was well received.

1724
01:59:26,530 --> 01:59:27,451
[SPEAKER_11]: It did perform under...

1725
01:59:28,692 --> 01:59:32,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, but we all kind of looked at that quote in the beginning and kind of went, really?

1726
01:59:33,014 --> 01:59:33,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1727
01:59:33,714 --> 01:59:34,434
[SPEAKER_11]: With that quote?

1728
01:59:34,454 --> 01:59:36,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Are people just pulling this way out of context?

1729
01:59:37,515 --> 01:59:39,096
[SPEAKER_12]: A, why not A plus?

1730
01:59:40,777 --> 01:59:41,457
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, right?

1731
01:59:41,997 --> 01:59:49,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, plus, I would think that if they're going to make a sequel, it's going to likely use a lot of the same components that were in the original.

1732
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:53,041
[SPEAKER_11]: So like I'm saying, they don't have to necessarily reinvent the wheel with a sequel.

1733
01:59:53,361 --> 01:59:56,042
[SPEAKER_11]: They can carry over a lot of stuff that they did with the first game.

1734
01:59:56,063 --> 01:59:57,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, granted, they'd want to do...

1735
01:59:57,523 --> 01:59:59,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Bigger, better, and all that other stuff.

1736
01:59:59,748 --> 02:00:03,295
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we kill her more?

1737
02:00:03,755 --> 02:00:09,006
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would think that you wouldn't necessarily maybe have to put the same financial investment into it.

1738
02:00:10,222 --> 02:00:32,235
[SPEAKER_11]: necessarily so maybe you could still get bang for the buck and maybe make up for this perceived lack although I don't know again I still think it seems like the game's done well and I'm sure it sold a ton of extra copies what was eight bucks on the steam sale this week and I'm sure there were a lot of people that snapped it up for that so I've had a lot of fun playing it so

1739
02:00:33,034 --> 02:00:34,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Some other comments from Gail Simone.

1740
02:00:35,075 --> 02:00:37,076
[SPEAKER_11]: The storytelling in the game hooked me instantly.

1741
02:00:37,396 --> 02:00:41,518
[SPEAKER_11]: The biggest difference is the game told a claustrophobic story in an isolated setting.

1742
02:00:41,818 --> 02:00:43,519
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going globetrotting.

1743
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:54,285
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe if there is a sequel, if this ties into it, it will be more Laura exploring rather than the whole, you know, escape from, you know, Death Sentence Island.

1744
02:00:54,345 --> 02:00:59,307
[SPEAKER_12]: She'll be seeking the legendary, elusive art thief, Carmen Sandiego.

1745
02:01:01,579 --> 02:01:11,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so, anyhow, exciting that, I mean, although I think, you know, a sequel to Good Game is a bit of a duh, it's still exciting to hear that that's in development.

1746
02:01:11,365 --> 02:01:13,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of franchise reboot, Carmen Sandiego.

1747
02:01:15,666 --> 02:01:16,286
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard about this.

1748
02:01:16,707 --> 02:01:18,409
[SPEAKER_11]: PBS has been teasing this, right?

1749
02:01:18,930 --> 02:01:20,552
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I was just saying they should do a sequel.

1750
02:01:31,966 --> 02:01:48,847
[SPEAKER_11]: but like I think they're doing something where they're going to play the old game show things again on PBS somebody in chat can help me fill in the gaps I just remember picking up bits and pieces of this on Twitter but like I think they are setting the stages for a Carmen Sandiego comeback so it's funny that you bring that up because like no legitimately there's there's something to that

1751
02:01:49,281 --> 02:01:50,162
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what would be funny?

1752
02:01:52,324 --> 02:01:55,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego would have worked in the 80s?

1753
02:01:56,688 --> 02:01:58,610
[SPEAKER_07]: But imagine having that now.

1754
02:01:58,630 --> 02:02:03,775
[SPEAKER_07]: People would be like, well, just can't we do GPS and use CCTV and all this?

1755
02:02:03,995 --> 02:02:05,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we found her in five seconds.

1756
02:02:07,078 --> 02:02:07,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Send a drone.

1757
02:02:07,959 --> 02:02:08,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Or more like...

1758
02:02:10,003 --> 02:02:10,683
[SPEAKER_12]: What country?

1759
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:12,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's that?

1760
02:02:12,665 --> 02:02:13,925
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never heard of that country.

1761
02:02:14,005 --> 02:02:14,465
[SPEAKER_12]: China!

1762
02:02:15,646 --> 02:02:16,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, stop.

1763
02:02:17,127 --> 02:02:17,467
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1764
02:02:18,047 --> 02:02:19,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Drew, that's made up.

1765
02:02:22,030 --> 02:02:22,830
[SPEAKER_11]: You're so ignorant.

1766
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:24,391
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, DarkSakura, what do you got?

1767
02:02:25,427 --> 02:02:25,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff.

1768
02:02:26,728 --> 02:02:27,910
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not Carmen Sandiego.

1769
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:28,690
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about Atlas.

1770
02:02:29,972 --> 02:02:38,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, Nintendo... Well, you know Atlas filed for bankruptcy and everyone's worried about a particular series of theirs, Shin Megami Tensei.

1771
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:39,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Nintendo's buying it.

1772
02:02:40,142 --> 02:02:46,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So we may see a Persona 5 Wii U. Yeah, you made a noise.

1773
02:02:46,328 --> 02:02:46,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1774
02:02:46,888 --> 02:02:47,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, no.

1775
02:02:47,209 --> 02:02:47,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I was laughing at chat.

1776
02:02:48,150 --> 02:02:48,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1777
02:02:49,042 --> 02:02:57,827
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Atlas kind of screwed themselves, but Nintendo seems to be grabbing the hot one.

1778
02:02:58,067 --> 02:03:00,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, all the fans, that was what they were worried about.

1779
02:03:00,288 --> 02:03:03,950
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to happen with Persona, with Shin Megami Tensei?

1780
02:03:04,071 --> 02:03:05,952
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like Nintendo's saving the series.

1781
02:03:06,852 --> 02:03:10,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought this whole bankruptcy thing wasn't supposed to be this big of a deal.

1782
02:03:10,234 --> 02:03:14,617
[SPEAKER_11]: And now here we're talking Nintendo's snapping up IPs.

1783
02:03:15,718 --> 02:03:18,720
[SPEAKER_11]: How did things go from A to Z like that?

1784
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they've already been working with Nintendo in this series because remember the crossover with Fire Emblem?

1785
02:03:24,024 --> 02:03:31,949
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like if you have Shin Megami Tensei IV, they had a crossover promotion with Fire Emblem.

1786
02:03:32,229 --> 02:03:35,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you had both of them, you'd get like $30 eShop credit in North America.

1787
02:03:37,501 --> 02:04:04,144
[SPEAKER_07]: so that was a big thing but I think that there's a they're developing Shin Megami Tensei cross Fire Emblem for Wii U so I think it's going to be I think it's going to definitely be I would be something can you imagine if Persona 5 was a Wii U exclusive now that's that would be a pretty crazy grab there yeah it would be but it's smart it's a smart move oh yeah

1788
02:04:06,735 --> 02:04:09,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Just real quick off, since we were talking about Carameldansen a second ago.

1789
02:04:10,276 --> 02:04:14,517
[SPEAKER_12]: So I pulled up that article that Ranma linked in chat, and they were talking about different things.

1790
02:04:14,577 --> 02:04:22,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the very bottom, of course, it said that Charlene, Teresa, Lynn, Thigpen, the one that was the chief on the show.

1791
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:23,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, she passed away.

1792
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:24,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, she passed away in 2003 and stuff.

1793
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:31,282
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I found a little bit disturbing is on Wikipedia, it actually shows where the resting place is.

1794
02:04:31,462 --> 02:04:33,383
[SPEAKER_12]: It tells you which cemetery she is buried in.

1795
02:04:33,963 --> 02:04:34,163
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1796
02:04:35,203 --> 02:04:36,664
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of wikis that do that.

1797
02:04:36,684 --> 02:04:38,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Wikipedia has that on a lot of articles.

1798
02:04:38,224 --> 02:04:38,905
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of weird.

1799
02:04:39,225 --> 02:04:40,245
[SPEAKER_11]: No, a lot of articles say that.

1800
02:04:40,505 --> 02:04:42,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's this whole other site.

1801
02:04:42,106 --> 02:04:44,366
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a whole site dedicated... Where are they buried, I think?

1802
02:04:44,386 --> 02:04:47,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's a whole site dedicated to celebrity tombstones.

1803
02:04:47,147 --> 02:04:49,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually... I don't know if I should...

1804
02:04:49,508 --> 02:04:49,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1805
02:04:49,848 --> 02:04:50,709
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, I'm like, no, thank you.

1806
02:04:50,729 --> 02:04:51,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Not my thing, but...

1807
02:05:09,059 --> 02:05:09,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Death Masks

1808
02:05:32,050 --> 02:05:58,179
[SPEAKER_07]: for anyone who doesn't know what those are basically there's a plaster cast made and then they're cast in bronze or sometimes clay or different things but the the death masks are basically the faces at death once they're you know ready to be buried and saved but there's people who still do death masks to this day and there's websites that have all the modern death masks so I'm gonna have one done do Walt Disney have one done I don't think so I plan on having one done though really isn't that expensive

1809
02:05:59,534 --> 02:06:01,875
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know how much plaster and stuff costs.

1810
02:06:02,356 --> 02:06:03,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you can't do it yourself.

1811
02:06:03,837 --> 02:06:06,578
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I have, Rob, how many artists do I know?

1812
02:06:06,758 --> 02:06:09,080
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true, that's true.

1813
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:13,762
[SPEAKER_11]: It costs a lot to join that, what is it called, the Neptune Society or whatever, the people that'll dump you at sea?

1814
02:06:15,503 --> 02:06:20,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my funeral is going to be Jewish and easy.

1815
02:06:21,687 --> 02:06:24,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Pine box buried 24 hours later, no embalming.

1816
02:06:25,745 --> 02:06:30,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I've already mentioned I want to be flung out of a cannon at my work building during the lunch hour.

1817
02:06:30,649 --> 02:06:31,170
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I want.

1818
02:06:31,190 --> 02:06:32,791
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually discussed what Dan wanted today.

1819
02:06:33,372 --> 02:06:40,697
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're doing is we're putting him in his 69 Mustang coupe, loading it with explosives, pushing it off a cliff, and blowing it up in midair.

1820
02:06:41,038 --> 02:06:41,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

1821
02:06:42,058 --> 02:06:46,042
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Genki style and Roger Corman style.

1822
02:06:47,903 --> 02:06:48,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Fancy.

1823
02:06:48,423 --> 02:06:48,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1824
02:06:49,284 --> 02:06:51,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I am having a Jewish burial and an Irish wake.

1825
02:06:51,906 --> 02:06:53,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you calling us on original?

1826
02:06:54,207 --> 02:06:54,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1827
02:06:54,468 --> 02:06:56,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on, Loki.

1828
02:06:56,689 --> 02:07:01,212
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Harmonix is due some sweet, sweet money.

1829
02:07:02,013 --> 02:07:05,315
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's because Viacom, they lost their appeal.

1830
02:07:05,875 --> 02:07:13,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Which, you know, there was a whole lawsuit, I guess, that they had owed Harmonix some money.

1831
02:07:13,801 --> 02:07:16,262
[SPEAKER_12]: And that includes now $299 million with interest.

1832
02:07:19,604 --> 02:07:21,825
[SPEAKER_12]: So, good for Harmonix.

1833
02:07:21,965 --> 02:07:25,746
[SPEAKER_12]: That should fund some extra tracks in Fantasia, right?

1834
02:07:27,187 --> 02:07:35,990
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess now it says, Harmonix's law firm estimates a payout, including another dispute, I guess the company has, for a total of $533 million.

1835
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,770
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a sweet chunk of change.

1836
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:36,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

1837
02:07:44,761 --> 02:07:46,302
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1838
02:08:07,268 --> 02:08:33,450
[SPEAKER_11]: so this isn't just you know virtual console releases they are redone in the 3d i i wouldn't expect a whole lot more i mean that's that's really it like i don't think they're going back and redoing all the graphics or anything like that so don't get your hopes too far up but you will be able to experience 3d altered beast 3d echo the dolphin 3d galaxy force 2 3d shinobi 3 3d sonic the hedgehog 3d space harrier 3d streets of rage and 3d super hang on i've

1839
02:08:33,490 --> 02:08:40,134
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that should look pretty cool considering that some of the 3D converts we've seen so far have been NES titles and now these are like 16-bit.

1840
02:08:40,554 --> 02:08:42,615
[SPEAKER_08]: 3D Space Harrier is going to be sweet.

1841
02:08:43,523 --> 02:08:46,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I... Like, 3D Kid Icarus was really cool.

1842
02:08:46,485 --> 02:08:50,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, they didn't change a lot, but it was just... Like, it was very subtle.

1843
02:08:50,308 --> 02:08:55,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, they added the backgrounds, very subtle updates that made it really cool.

1844
02:08:55,472 --> 02:08:56,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I like that one a lot.

1845
02:08:57,473 --> 02:08:59,995
[SPEAKER_11]: But, like, some of the 3D remakes were a little silly.

1846
02:09:00,035 --> 02:09:02,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, 3D Wrecking... No, not Wrecking Crew.

1847
02:09:02,217 --> 02:09:03,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Urban Champion or whatever.

1848
02:09:03,238 --> 02:09:04,459
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a little silly.

1849
02:09:05,079 --> 02:09:08,101
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, it'll be cool to check out a couple of these.

1850
02:09:08,181 --> 02:09:09,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about 3D Altered Beast.

1851
02:09:09,842 --> 02:09:10,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't...

1852
02:09:10,803 --> 02:09:12,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Wise from your grave.

1853
02:09:13,326 --> 02:09:17,790
[SPEAKER_11]: People remember that epicness from the arcade when they were a kid and stuff, but I played through the game recently.

1854
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:19,232
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really not that good.

1855
02:09:19,632 --> 02:09:20,953
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really not that good.

1856
02:09:21,754 --> 02:09:25,578
[SPEAKER_11]: But 3D Sonic will be cool, even though it'll be like the 17th time I've played Sonic.

1857
02:09:25,938 --> 02:09:26,919
[SPEAKER_11]: But 3D Space Harrier.

1858
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:28,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm here for that.

1859
02:09:28,401 --> 02:09:29,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

1860
02:09:29,582 --> 02:09:30,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Get ready.

1861
02:09:30,683 --> 02:09:31,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting ready.

1862
02:09:32,044 --> 02:09:32,865
[SPEAKER_11]: My body is ready.

1863
02:09:33,065 --> 02:09:33,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Your body.

1864
02:09:34,557 --> 02:09:35,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you in the fantasy zone, Rob?

1865
02:09:35,838 --> 02:09:36,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1866
02:09:36,919 --> 02:09:38,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, are you in the mailbag zone?

1867
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:38,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have you?

1868
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:39,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we have two.

1869
02:09:39,781 --> 02:09:41,322
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have emails tonight, woohoo!

1870
02:09:41,502 --> 02:09:42,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Two whole emails!

1871
02:09:43,343 --> 02:09:49,888
[SPEAKER_11]: You can email us too, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Well great, I better pay attention because I have no idea what these are about tonight.

1872
02:09:49,908 --> 02:09:50,848
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't get to read them in advance.

1873
02:09:51,069 --> 02:09:53,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Well this comes from Brad, our podculture Brad.

1874
02:09:53,770 --> 02:09:54,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi podculture Brad!

1875
02:09:55,231 --> 02:09:59,735
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of part A, you guys said there were not any emails yet, so how about a kitty pic instead?

1876
02:09:59,755 --> 02:10:02,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So they sent us a picture of his kitty patting at the screen.

1877
02:10:03,968 --> 02:10:04,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's adorable.

1878
02:10:05,049 --> 02:10:08,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Kitty.

1879
02:10:08,833 --> 02:10:10,755
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to get to meet Brad in five weeks.

1880
02:10:10,775 --> 02:10:12,477
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited.

1881
02:10:12,497 --> 02:10:15,700
[SPEAKER_12]: I am super pissed at my cat.

1882
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:16,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

1883
02:10:17,001 --> 02:10:19,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she's trying to chew on my 3DS charge cable.

1884
02:10:20,945 --> 02:10:24,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And every time I move it out of her way, she's like, uh-uh, I'm going to get it.

1885
02:10:24,769 --> 02:10:25,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Meow.

1886
02:10:25,848 --> 02:10:27,530
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to buy her a shoestring or something.

1887
02:10:28,051 --> 02:10:28,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I have toys for her.

1888
02:10:29,053 --> 02:10:32,577
[SPEAKER_07]: She plays with all of Shermie's toys because Shermie's too fat and lazy.

1889
02:10:33,098 --> 02:10:34,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Except I won't give her Shermie's mousy.

1890
02:10:35,201 --> 02:10:36,884
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

1891
02:10:36,944 --> 02:10:38,546
[SPEAKER_07]: This house that we're looking at has a cat door in it.

1892
02:10:42,235 --> 02:10:42,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Next email.

1893
02:10:43,355 --> 02:10:44,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's Rissimo.

1894
02:10:44,835 --> 02:10:52,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't emailed or called in like forever, but just a quick thank you for all your hard work and dedication to your craft and to your fans.

1895
02:10:53,037 --> 02:10:55,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been listening since I first heard about you guys on Joystick.

1896
02:10:56,478 --> 02:10:57,178
[SPEAKER_07]: We were on Joystick.

1897
02:10:57,218 --> 02:10:58,218
[SPEAKER_11]: We were on Joystick?

1898
02:10:58,658 --> 02:10:59,759
[SPEAKER_07]: When the hell did that happen?

1899
02:11:01,939 --> 02:11:03,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh!

1900
02:11:04,061 --> 02:11:08,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they used to do like a weekly podcast thing and I think we were featured once.

1901
02:11:09,424 --> 02:11:17,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I remember PlayStation Joystick site did a really nice write-up on olrpsp.com some time ago.

1902
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:18,350
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really cool.

1903
02:11:18,971 --> 02:11:21,673
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to say probably when the whole...

1904
02:11:22,895 --> 02:11:23,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Gagahamster

1905
02:11:39,232 --> 02:11:43,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, which by the way, just the Glamster was what we were going to call it.

1906
02:11:43,876 --> 02:11:47,638
[SPEAKER_11]: AkumaJP, bless his heart, did do some research on Glamster.

1907
02:11:48,199 --> 02:11:50,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And they don't have a Twitter, it seems like.

1908
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:51,882
[SPEAKER_11]: But he did get us the website.

1909
02:11:51,982 --> 02:11:54,544
[SPEAKER_11]: It's bergsala-lightweight.co.jp

1910
02:11:56,485 --> 02:11:58,747
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the pretty, pretty princess of hamsters.

1911
02:12:19,048 --> 02:12:27,294
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to bombard their Twitter and try to take another social media campaign like we did with President Cat to its horrendous success.

1912
02:12:27,795 --> 02:12:30,377
[SPEAKER_11]: But no luck.

1913
02:12:30,397 --> 02:12:32,518
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no Twitter to bug them through.

1914
02:12:32,558 --> 02:12:34,880
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll keep trying.

1915
02:12:36,361 --> 02:12:39,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you remember the Katamari debacle of yesteryear.

1916
02:12:39,944 --> 02:12:44,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Haven't missed a single episode and felt the need to say thanks for getting me through so many work days.

1917
02:12:45,268 --> 02:12:45,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you all.

1918
02:12:45,928 --> 02:12:46,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks once again.

1919
02:12:46,789 --> 02:12:47,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Sent from my iPhone.

1920
02:12:49,005 --> 02:12:49,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that was very nice.

1921
02:12:49,745 --> 02:12:52,026
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no questions or opinions.

1922
02:12:52,186 --> 02:12:53,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I like nice emails.

1923
02:12:53,666 --> 02:12:54,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1924
02:12:54,766 --> 02:12:56,807
[SPEAKER_11]: That was just a good old-fashioned thank you.

1925
02:12:56,947 --> 02:13:00,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially, there was only one missing comma.

1926
02:13:01,268 --> 02:13:02,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was quite pleased.

1927
02:13:03,408 --> 02:13:04,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and you're welcome.

1928
02:13:04,988 --> 02:13:05,689
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you for that.

1929
02:13:06,729 --> 02:13:09,169
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always really awesome to see things like that.

1930
02:13:09,509 --> 02:13:11,550
[SPEAKER_07]: You get an invisible gold star for awesome.

1931
02:13:14,195 --> 02:13:20,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I gotta say, I so appreciate the small gestures people have done to just kind of say thanks for OLR.

1932
02:13:20,619 --> 02:13:27,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, Codeman got me Borderlands 2 because I was bitching about wanting it last week and he was kind enough to get that for me.

1933
02:13:27,402 --> 02:13:28,063
[SPEAKER_11]: That means a lot.

1934
02:13:28,503 --> 02:13:33,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got a trading card I wanted just because somebody had it and was like, hey, I like OLR.

1935
02:13:34,066 --> 02:13:34,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, have this.

1936
02:13:34,787 --> 02:13:35,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you need it.

1937
02:13:35,927 --> 02:13:37,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And, like, didn't expect anything in return.

1938
02:13:37,508 --> 02:13:38,749
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, that's all.

1939
02:13:38,809 --> 02:13:42,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though those cards are only like 18 cents, still, it's just like the gesture is like, oh my god.

1940
02:13:42,952 --> 02:13:44,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually the small gestures I get are lewd.

1941
02:13:50,042 --> 02:13:51,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a wiener for you, DarkSakura.

1942
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:57,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Slidekick found our article.

1943
02:13:58,806 --> 02:14:02,548
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1944
02:14:29,813 --> 02:14:30,793
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an old article.

1945
02:14:31,073 --> 02:14:35,474
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll tell you what, probably updated it the last time they ran that article.

1946
02:14:35,674 --> 02:14:37,135
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the last time you updated it?

1947
02:14:37,155 --> 02:14:37,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1948
02:14:38,455 --> 02:14:51,898
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, actually, I'm getting the emails from GoDaddy to renew OrangeLoungeRadio.com, which obviously that'll happen, even though we really need to do something with that website to modernize it a little bit and get it away from the hackers.

1949
02:14:52,298 --> 02:14:56,939
[SPEAKER_11]: But OLRPSP.com is up for renewal, and I'm questioning if I should renew it.

1950
02:14:57,159 --> 02:14:57,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not.

1951
02:14:59,099 --> 02:15:03,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of feel like there's people that'll be pissed off if I let it go.

1952
02:15:03,261 --> 02:15:03,881
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, hold on.

1953
02:15:04,901 --> 02:15:06,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a Facebook comment the other day.

1954
02:15:06,942 --> 02:15:11,003
[SPEAKER_12]: You can still access it by going to orangelaunchradio.com slash PSP.

1955
02:15:11,624 --> 02:15:12,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

1956
02:15:12,184 --> 02:15:16,505
[SPEAKER_11]: So... All right, then I feel better letting it go if that's going to be the case.

1957
02:15:16,606 --> 02:15:18,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because in fact, I'll still check this real quick.

1958
02:15:18,626 --> 02:15:20,207
[SPEAKER_07]: You have such a cute kitty, Brad.

1959
02:15:21,467 --> 02:15:23,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's slash PSP.

1960
02:15:23,848 --> 02:15:24,729
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that actually...

1961
02:15:27,017 --> 02:15:45,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yeah, see, if you do orangeonstreet.com slash PSP Okay, well that's cool, then yeah, I might let olrpsp.com lapse, if there's still a way to get to it Alright A lot of these pages don't work anymore Ranma, secret message, send me some I will Alright

1962
02:15:47,266 --> 02:15:50,450
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw says, why not change OLR PSP to a mobile site?

1963
02:15:51,431 --> 02:15:51,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh, no.

1964
02:15:52,652 --> 02:15:54,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I kind of feel the same.

1965
02:15:54,353 --> 02:15:56,275
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, that's a lot of work to maintain.

1966
02:15:56,315 --> 02:16:00,339
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a lot of the focus right now is also on building VOG Network.

1967
02:16:00,399 --> 02:16:02,601
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like the central hub and making that bigger and better.

1968
02:16:02,821 --> 02:16:03,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Network's okay on mobile.

1969
02:16:04,123 --> 02:16:09,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and that, you know, I think the next step at some point for VOG will be a mobile app.

1970
02:16:09,608 --> 02:16:10,869
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's, you know...

1971
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:12,650
[SPEAKER_11]: in the future.

1972
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:13,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Ways away.

1973
02:16:14,031 --> 02:16:15,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get excited about that.

1974
02:16:15,791 --> 02:16:16,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Long ways out.

1975
02:16:17,311 --> 02:16:23,153
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll probably see it'll come out around the time Zelda's finally out on Wii U. All right.

1976
02:16:24,593 --> 02:16:24,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1977
02:16:26,834 --> 02:16:27,694
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it for emails, right?

1978
02:16:28,714 --> 02:16:29,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Yar.

1979
02:16:29,274 --> 02:16:32,515
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

1980
02:16:33,055 --> 02:16:36,996
[SPEAKER_11]: That means it's the time in the show when we do the F use of the week.

1981
02:16:53,672 --> 02:16:54,392
[SPEAKER_07]: My F.U.

1982
02:16:55,353 --> 02:16:57,473
[SPEAKER_07]: goes to this cough that will not go away.

1983
02:16:58,194 --> 02:17:00,455
[SPEAKER_07]: The conditions of some of the houses we've seen.

1984
02:17:00,815 --> 02:17:03,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there were like burnt carpet and cat pee smells.

1985
02:17:04,636 --> 02:17:07,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of these people, like the HUD houses, oh my god, it's so bad.

1986
02:17:07,497 --> 02:17:08,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And then another F.U.

1987
02:17:08,498 --> 02:17:10,298
[SPEAKER_07]: just to the housing industry in general.

1988
02:17:10,858 --> 02:17:13,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's really like this weird...

1989
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll keep my fingers and my toes crossed.

1990
02:17:17,821 --> 02:17:17,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

1991
02:17:41,553 --> 02:17:44,796
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, just fuck you, yeah, because I still don't have a fixed controller yet.

1992
02:17:44,916 --> 02:17:52,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though it sort of seems like it's going on the right track, I thought the same thing back on July 1st, and look where we are now.

1993
02:17:53,266 --> 02:17:53,987
[SPEAKER_12]: So, fuck them.

1994
02:17:56,226 --> 02:17:56,486
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it?

1995
02:17:56,506 --> 02:17:56,927
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1996
02:17:57,948 --> 02:18:10,519
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU goes to the fact that I can't follow through things on certain things that I say I'm going to do and convince myself that I'm going to do, but then I'm just like, but you can't really do that, even though you probably should.

1997
02:18:10,779 --> 02:18:11,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the gym, Rob.

1998
02:18:12,273 --> 02:18:13,955
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1999
02:18:35,003 --> 02:18:35,303
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2000
02:18:35,444 --> 02:18:44,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, back to a couple more news stories in the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2001
02:18:44,973 --> 02:18:51,520
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I guess Namco is prepping a HD version of Soul Calibur 2.

2002
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:56,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Soul Calibur 2 HD Online coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this fall.

2003
02:18:57,265 --> 02:19:05,808
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming as a download title because I haven't seen anything on here that says that it's going to be released at retail.

2004
02:19:06,668 --> 02:19:08,709
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I haven't heard of anything yet about retail.

2005
02:19:09,449 --> 02:19:15,952
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, apparently the game is going to be closer to HD now.

2006
02:19:15,972 --> 02:19:16,932
[SPEAKER_12]: The outputting at 720p.

2007
02:19:16,972 --> 02:19:17,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2008
02:19:23,191 --> 02:19:23,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Neat.

2009
02:19:23,811 --> 02:19:26,172
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming that the special characters aren't going to be in the game.

2010
02:19:26,192 --> 02:19:31,273
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, because you probably can't get spawn or, you know, obviously Link's not going to be back because he was only on GameCube.

2011
02:19:31,893 --> 02:19:33,553
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Heihachi?

2012
02:19:34,513 --> 02:19:34,713
Yeah.

2013
02:19:36,174 --> 02:19:36,874
[SPEAKER_12]: So no Link.

2014
02:19:36,914 --> 02:19:38,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, because that was GameCube.

2015
02:19:38,914 --> 02:19:39,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, yeah.

2016
02:19:40,835 --> 02:19:41,855
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know.

2017
02:19:44,736 --> 02:19:46,416
[SPEAKER_12]: It's bad it's not coming to Wii U.

2018
02:19:47,927 --> 02:19:49,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

2019
02:19:49,809 --> 02:19:50,369
[SPEAKER_11]: But you never know.

2020
02:19:50,409 --> 02:19:52,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you never know, but... Yeah, we're kind of not getting my hopes up.

2021
02:19:52,951 --> 02:19:54,092
[SPEAKER_11]: This Wii doesn't run games, I guess.

2022
02:19:55,353 --> 02:19:56,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it does.

2023
02:19:56,073 --> 02:19:56,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Be quiet.

2024
02:19:57,074 --> 02:19:57,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop trolling.

2025
02:19:58,896 --> 02:20:01,918
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, one more news story for you guys before we open up the Skype line.

2026
02:20:01,978 --> 02:20:03,920
[SPEAKER_11]: And I gotta say, this is a really...

2027
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:05,360
[SPEAKER_11]: All You Can Arcade

2028
02:20:20,683 --> 02:20:21,264
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2029
02:20:36,923 --> 02:20:37,624
[SPEAKER_11]: brought to you.

2030
02:20:38,245 --> 02:20:41,288
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can swap them out for a different one in stock or whatever.

2031
02:20:41,409 --> 02:20:45,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, it's only in certain areas because they bring the games to you, which is pretty amazing.

2032
02:20:46,034 --> 02:20:51,260
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only available in the San Francisco Bay Area, Stockton, San Jose, Santa Rosa, and Sacramento.

2033
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:52,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Sacramento has it.

2034
02:20:54,103 --> 02:20:54,623
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

2035
02:21:23,122 --> 02:21:38,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is crazy, I mean it's very ambitious I should probably share that with Dan's Pinball Group Yeah, I mean I didn't see if there were actually But yeah, some of the cabinets they have on here, I mean most of them are old stuff But still, you know, Bad Dudes, Ms.

2036
02:21:38,733 --> 02:21:47,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Pac-Man, I'm looking at the site Which we're totally just giving them free advertising here But whatever, it's a neat idea And it's really taking the Netflix thing to the next level, isn't it?

2037
02:21:47,620 --> 02:21:49,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the totally fake picture though

2038
02:21:49,733 --> 02:21:51,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, these little gals playing the game and having fun.

2039
02:21:51,976 --> 02:21:53,277
[SPEAKER_07]: And the little black dresses and heels.

2040
02:21:53,417 --> 02:21:54,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, versus Goonies.

2041
02:21:54,739 --> 02:21:55,460
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

2042
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:56,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I want that.

2043
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:56,481
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

2044
02:21:57,461 --> 02:21:58,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Where can you view what they have?

2045
02:21:59,462 --> 02:22:01,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Allyoucanarcade.com Yeah, I went there.

2046
02:22:02,143 --> 02:22:03,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Signing up.

2047
02:22:03,664 --> 02:22:05,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can actually browse games available in my area.

2048
02:22:05,945 --> 02:22:06,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

02:22:06,686 --> 02:22:06,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Where?

2050
02:22:07,006 --> 02:22:07,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I put in my zip code here.

2051
02:22:08,026 --> 02:22:09,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in the upper right corner.

2052

[SPEAKER_11]: Bad Dudes, Berserk, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Golden Tee.

2053
02:22:15,790 --> 02:22:16,611
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't all of them.

2054
02:22:16,651 --> 02:22:18,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just looking at... Heavy Barrel's a good one.

2055
02:22:18,952 --> 02:22:19,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

2056
02:22:19,212 --> 02:22:19,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Silkworm.

2057
02:22:20,093 --> 02:22:20,333
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2058
02:22:20,793 --> 02:22:23,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.

2059
02:22:23,654 --> 02:22:24,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Get out, really?

2060
02:22:24,575 --> 02:22:25,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

2061
02:22:26,276 --> 02:22:26,516
I didn't...

2062
02:22:28,195 --> 02:22:30,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, there is a DDR machine.

2063
02:22:30,576 --> 02:22:32,377
[SPEAKER_11]: But you were just looking at area.

2064
02:22:33,197 --> 02:22:34,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I was looking at area.

2065
02:22:34,658 --> 02:22:35,478
[SPEAKER_08]: This is looking at Sacramento.

2066
02:22:36,098 --> 02:22:38,279
[SPEAKER_11]: It might not be available in your area necessarily.

2067
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:42,261
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, that's the type of game they're willing to rent.

2068
02:22:42,381 --> 02:22:43,482
[SPEAKER_11]: One might show up, Loki.

2069
02:22:43,942 --> 02:22:45,162
[SPEAKER_07]: They need a 2DX on that list.

2070
02:22:45,462 --> 02:22:45,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh boy.

2071
02:22:45,903 --> 02:22:46,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I will rent it forever.

2072
02:22:48,892 --> 02:22:49,212
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2073
02:22:49,612 --> 02:22:58,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I may have to hog that if I actually... Hey, if the idea does well and I just totally gave them free advertising... Dude, I would totally just want to buy that.

2074
02:22:58,598 --> 02:22:59,318
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of neat.

2075
02:23:00,099 --> 02:23:01,820
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, there you go.

2076
02:23:01,980 --> 02:23:02,380
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

2077
02:23:02,681 --> 02:23:04,482
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it for the stories we had on deck tonight.

2078
02:23:04,522 --> 02:23:06,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to open up our Skype line if you want to give us a call.

2079
02:23:06,683 --> 02:23:10,586
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2080
02:23:10,606 --> 02:23:14,429
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's something you want to talk about tonight that we haven't brought up, we'll get to Twitter topics in a minute here.

2081
02:23:14,489 --> 02:23:16,150
[SPEAKER_11]: But first, some last-minute stories.

2082
02:23:16,450 --> 02:23:18,131
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, I think you said you had one tonight, right?

2083
02:23:18,331 --> 02:23:45,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I do and I seriously thought I'd put it in my stories and I didn't so this goes out to all the homestucks basically Hussie shut up basically Hussie is going to be working with Namco doing a dating sim the game is called Namco High and it is a fictional crossover high school that all the Namco characters are going to so it's yeah date high school sim and

2084
02:23:47,538 --> 02:23:51,061
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically it's going to be Namco character shipping the game.

2085
02:23:52,503 --> 02:23:53,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everybody does with Homestuck.

2086
02:23:54,184 --> 02:24:04,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking at characters from Xenogears, Tekken, Idolmaster, Bites and Kratos, so... Here we go with Pac-Man.

2087
02:24:04,953 --> 02:24:05,694
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds weird.

2088
02:24:06,134 --> 02:24:06,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally getting it.

2089
02:24:06,995 --> 02:24:08,056
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds weird.

2090
02:24:08,076 --> 02:24:11,479
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like that one sim that they had where you date, like, birds.

2091
02:24:11,719 --> 02:24:11,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2092
02:24:13,050 --> 02:24:15,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Hatafulboyfriend.

2093
02:24:16,091 --> 02:24:17,712
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's go to the phones.

2094
02:24:18,352 --> 02:24:19,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2095
02:24:19,733 --> 02:24:20,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

2096
02:24:20,713 --> 02:24:22,334
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the one and only Ranma.

2097
02:24:22,394 --> 02:24:23,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma, how's it going?

2098
02:24:24,515 --> 02:24:25,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, good.

2099
02:24:25,235 --> 02:24:27,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got a brand new mixer on Saturday.

2100
02:24:28,197 --> 02:24:28,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, congrats.

2101
02:24:29,217 --> 02:24:34,059
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to hear an even more high-fidelity anime jam session soon.

2102
02:24:34,079 --> 02:24:35,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Either that or lots of margaritas.

2103
02:24:37,171 --> 02:24:40,452
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll happen provided Drew Nami doesn't knock the desk over.

2104
02:24:41,132 --> 02:24:42,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't invite him to your house.

2105
02:24:43,633 --> 02:24:46,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I told him he had to sign a release form first.

2106
02:24:47,074 --> 02:24:50,856
[SPEAKER_07]: In Drew Nami's defense, he came over on the 4th of July and didn't knock anything over.

2107
02:24:51,196 --> 02:24:51,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

2108
02:24:51,716 --> 02:24:53,817
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I actually, he needs to come back to the show.

2109
02:24:53,857 --> 02:24:54,637
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been far too long.

2110
02:24:56,498 --> 02:24:57,478
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds pretty cool.

2111
02:24:57,998 --> 02:24:59,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, congrats on your new mixing board.

2112
02:24:59,599 --> 02:25:00,159
[SPEAKER_11]: What else is up?

2113
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:13,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much, but I want to stand behind Loki and join him in the lynching of Ouya because I have my own issues when it comes to gaming customer service.

2114
02:25:13,784 --> 02:25:20,567
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just close to literally losing my shit on Facebook and Twitter before they got back to me.

2115
02:25:21,447 --> 02:25:24,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, why don't you air your grievances here?

2116
02:25:25,225 --> 02:25:32,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Long story short, I bought a headset by Astro Gaming because I played them at PAX East last year and I loved them.

2117
02:25:32,808 --> 02:25:36,889
[SPEAKER_10]: So what happened was there was a short in the headset or the mic was dead.

2118
02:25:37,890 --> 02:25:45,432
[SPEAKER_10]: After waiting for the perfect time to pack up everything, I pack up the microphone, the headset, and the mixer because I was having troubles with that too.

2119
02:25:45,973 --> 02:25:46,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Sent it out.

2120
02:25:46,693 --> 02:25:49,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Two weeks later, I get a brand new mixer.

2121
02:25:50,594 --> 02:25:53,335
[SPEAKER_10]: A brand new microphone, same headset.

2122
02:25:53,775 --> 02:26:00,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm looking at the new mixer and they're telling me the battery that I had works for it, but the new mixer doesn't use the battery.

2123
02:26:00,758 --> 02:26:02,419
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a couple extra connectors on there.

2124
02:26:02,659 --> 02:26:04,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even use my optical out because they changed that.

2125
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:07,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm like, whatever, I can work with it.

2126
02:26:07,581 --> 02:26:10,102
[SPEAKER_10]: I can still do my podcasting and the music and so forth.

2127
02:26:10,622 --> 02:26:11,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Plug in the mic.

2128
02:26:11,542 --> 02:26:12,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's working well.

2129
02:26:13,624 --> 02:26:16,466
[SPEAKER_10]: A week later, the mics start shorting out again.

2130
02:26:17,227 --> 02:26:22,510
[SPEAKER_10]: So I contact them, and I'm like, okay, what they're probably going to do is send me a new kit.

2131
02:26:22,791 --> 02:26:24,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I pack up everything and send it back.

2132
02:26:24,792 --> 02:26:28,635
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, no, we need you to pack up everything, send it to us, and we'll send it back to you.

2133
02:26:29,295 --> 02:26:31,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, I use this for every day.

2134
02:26:31,657 --> 02:26:32,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't be without it.

2135
02:26:32,998 --> 02:26:37,621
[SPEAKER_10]: They say, okay, we'll send you a two-day UPS label.

2136
02:26:38,042 --> 02:26:39,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, you're not helping me here.

2137
02:26:41,624 --> 02:26:45,486
[SPEAKER_10]: So I end up going on their Twitter, their support Twitter, asking for help.

2138
02:26:45,846 --> 02:26:49,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I go on their Facebook, asking for help, explaining everything.

2139
02:26:50,769 --> 02:26:56,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually went as far as, when I was at PAX East this year, speaking to a rep at their booth to get this taken care of.

2140
02:26:56,591 --> 02:26:59,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that's dedication to the cause.

2141
02:26:59,733 --> 02:27:01,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I packed up all my equipment and took it down.

2142
02:27:01,934 --> 02:27:05,276
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because I actually like the quality of the equipment.

2143
02:27:05,596 --> 02:27:07,417
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just their customer service sucks.

2144
02:27:07,817 --> 02:27:09,498
[SPEAKER_10]: And every email I get back from them,

2145
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:11,641
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2146
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:30,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Friday, I check Twitter.

2147
02:27:30,821 --> 02:27:35,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I get a private message from the support saying they're so sorry since nothing has happened.

2148
02:27:35,983 --> 02:27:37,004
[SPEAKER_10]: No one's gotten back to me.

2149
02:27:37,364 --> 02:27:38,484
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been 30 days.

2150
02:27:38,985 --> 02:27:45,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I get in my email an actual phone number where I can call them and talk to them and explain the whole situation.

2151
02:27:47,150 --> 02:27:50,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, but did that actually fix it finally?

2152
02:27:50,993 --> 02:27:54,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet, because this past weekend I took a semi sort of sabbatical.

2153
02:27:54,475 --> 02:27:57,157
[SPEAKER_10]: I just stepped away, just did my own thing.

2154
02:27:57,777 --> 02:28:00,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow, I'm going to call and just get this taken care of.

2155
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:05,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Because like I said, Astro, the headsets, the mixers, the stuff's really good.

2156
02:28:05,483 --> 02:28:10,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't complain, because I use it for podcasting, listening to music, gaming on my consoles.

2157
02:28:11,627 --> 02:28:11,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2158
02:28:11,747 --> 02:28:11,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2159
02:28:38,263 --> 02:28:39,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well anything else?

2160
02:28:39,584 --> 02:28:41,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other grievances you want to air on tonight's OLR?

2161
02:28:42,467 --> 02:28:42,867
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2162
02:28:42,947 --> 02:28:43,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just say this.

2163
02:28:43,908 --> 02:28:46,050
[SPEAKER_10]: If you buy this, buy it from Best Buy.

2164
02:28:46,231 --> 02:28:47,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Get their service plan.

2165
02:28:47,932 --> 02:28:51,035
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll save you a lot of frustration and hair on your head.

2166
02:28:51,536 --> 02:28:51,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

2167
02:28:52,236 --> 02:28:53,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you take care, Ranma.

2168
02:28:53,918 --> 02:28:54,478
[SPEAKER_11]: You too, bro.

2169
02:28:54,558 --> 02:28:55,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, bye-bye.

2170
02:28:56,880 --> 02:28:58,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Always good to hear from our buddy Ranma.

2171
02:28:58,421 --> 02:29:00,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights here at the Voice Eats Network.

2172
02:29:01,082 --> 02:29:01,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.

2173
02:29:01,883 --> 02:29:06,625
[SPEAKER_11]: While we wait for more calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2174
02:29:06,805 --> 02:29:08,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have anything for last minutes?

2175
02:29:08,246 --> 02:29:17,211
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have any last minute stories, but I'd like to, once again, because I threw around this idea on Twitter and all of it, I think I'm going to move forward with it, which is...

2176
02:29:17,851 --> 02:29:34,402
[SPEAKER_12]: The, uh, Loki's 24-hour, uh, Total Noob Game Jam, basically, an experiment, because I've been going through this whole, like, game-making thing and actually just, you know, reading up a lot on programming and Unity and all that fun stuff, and now I just want to get my, get my hands dirty with it.

2177
02:29:35,163 --> 02:29:40,386
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, the experiment is basically, I'm gonna spend 24 hours putting together a game.

2178
02:29:40,466 --> 02:29:44,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, obviously, unlike regular game jams, I don't have enough time to sit...

2179
02:29:45,410 --> 02:29:47,111
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not 24 consecutive hours.

2180
02:29:47,592 --> 02:29:48,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, because our phone's lighting up.

2181
02:29:49,073 --> 02:29:52,456
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll come back to your thoughts in a minute here, but let's go to the phones.

2182
02:29:52,837 --> 02:29:53,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2183
02:29:53,978 --> 02:29:54,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

2184
02:29:55,359 --> 02:29:56,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey, it's LokiLives46.

2185
02:29:57,521 --> 02:29:59,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, say that again.

2186
02:29:59,463 --> 02:30:01,725
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... LokiLives46.

2187
02:30:02,146 --> 02:30:05,369
[SPEAKER_11]: LokiLives46, but no relation to our Loki.

2188
02:30:06,471 --> 02:30:08,011
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, unfortunately not.

2189
02:30:09,132 --> 02:30:10,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it is a commonly used name.

2190
02:30:11,332 --> 02:30:12,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, where did you get yours?

2191
02:30:12,512 --> 02:30:15,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours did not come from Thor or anything.

2192
02:30:15,213 --> 02:30:16,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours came from The Mask.

2193
02:30:16,353 --> 02:30:17,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a fan of Jim Carrey.

2194
02:30:17,294 --> 02:30:19,454
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mask, way back when, right?

2195
02:30:20,034 --> 02:30:21,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

2196
02:30:21,715 --> 02:30:24,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a bit of a persona I've taken up.

2197
02:30:26,456 --> 02:30:29,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a very mischievous little brat.

2198
02:30:29,296 --> 02:30:31,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, so yours is inspired from The Mask, too?

2199
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:33,781
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2200
02:30:54,713 --> 02:30:55,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, so are we.

2201
02:30:55,615 --> 02:30:57,559
[SPEAKER_11]: You're in good company here at the Voice Geeks Network.

2202
02:30:57,579 --> 02:31:02,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're all a little nerdy.

2203
02:31:02,068 --> 02:31:03,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, how have things been going for you guys?

2204
02:31:04,232 --> 02:31:04,593
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

2205
02:31:05,384 --> 02:31:06,624
[SPEAKER_03]: How have things been going for you guys?

2206
02:31:08,105 --> 02:31:08,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantastic!

2207
02:31:09,445 --> 02:31:12,967
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, DarkSakura?

2208
02:31:13,267 --> 02:31:14,267
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the listeners want to know.

2209
02:31:14,307 --> 02:31:15,087
[SPEAKER_11]: How the hell are you?

2210
02:31:15,488 --> 02:31:16,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I want this house.

2211
02:31:16,728 --> 02:31:18,269
[SPEAKER_11]: You want this house that you've been looking at?

2212
02:31:18,409 --> 02:31:18,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm longing.

2213
02:31:18,649 --> 02:31:19,289
[SPEAKER_07]: She's house hunting.

2214
02:31:19,489 --> 02:31:20,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm longing.

2215
02:31:20,449 --> 02:31:20,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2216
02:31:21,130 --> 02:31:22,470
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm employed now, so that's good.

2217
02:31:22,570 --> 02:31:27,752
[SPEAKER_11]: And our Loki is full of gummy bears, but he just ran to the kitchen real quick.

2218
02:31:28,532 --> 02:31:29,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I pity his porcelain right now.

2219
02:31:30,313 --> 02:31:30,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

2220
02:31:30,953 --> 02:31:32,274
[SPEAKER_03]: What, you're not a gummy bear fan?

2221
02:31:32,374 --> 02:31:32,874
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that?

2222
02:31:33,849 --> 02:31:36,472
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just that high concentration of sugar.

2223
02:31:36,552 --> 02:31:37,853
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm allergic to them.

2224
02:31:38,013 --> 02:31:41,817
[SPEAKER_12]: I already ate some of them, but there's no way I'm going to eat a ton of them.

2225
02:31:41,897 --> 02:31:43,379
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll seriously make me feel sick.

2226
02:31:45,161 --> 02:31:45,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fair enough.

2227
02:31:46,082 --> 02:31:47,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I'll let you guys get back to it.

2228
02:31:47,863 --> 02:31:48,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, fair enough.

2229
02:31:49,245 --> 02:31:50,927
[SPEAKER_11]: No games you want to talk about tonight or anything?

2230
02:31:50,947 --> 02:31:51,828
[SPEAKER_11]: What have you been playing?

2231
02:31:52,909 --> 02:31:55,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just been crazy busy with work, so I haven't really had a chance to.

2232
02:31:57,567 --> 02:31:59,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you better get on that.

2233
02:31:59,909 --> 02:32:03,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Last day of the Steam sale, last chance he games at a discount.

2234
02:32:03,451 --> 02:32:04,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Put all that money to use.

2235
02:32:06,332 --> 02:32:08,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my wallet doesn't like those Steam sales.

2236
02:32:08,253 --> 02:32:09,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you that much.

2237
02:32:09,974 --> 02:32:10,415
[SPEAKER_11]: That happens.

2238
02:32:10,475 --> 02:32:11,015
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, buddy.

2239
02:32:11,035 --> 02:32:11,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thanks for the call.

2240
02:32:11,775 --> 02:32:12,256
[SPEAKER_11]: You take care.

2241
02:32:12,976 --> 02:32:13,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you too.

2242
02:32:13,496 --> 02:32:14,077
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, bye.

2243
02:32:15,497 --> 02:32:18,139
[SPEAKER_11]: He just called to ask, how the hell are you?

2244
02:32:19,562 --> 02:32:20,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Alive and kicking.

2245
02:32:20,923 --> 02:32:21,324
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hot.

2246
02:32:21,464 --> 02:32:22,345
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very courteous.

2247
02:32:22,365 --> 02:32:23,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is a little hot, isn't it?

2248
02:32:23,546 --> 02:32:26,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not even like one of those... It's getting hot in here.

2249
02:32:26,509 --> 02:32:30,893
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll make sure the AC is on while... Well, I think it doesn't... Aren't you guys cooking a pizza or something?

2250
02:32:30,993 --> 02:32:31,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

2251
02:32:31,614 --> 02:32:33,275
[SPEAKER_11]: He's making a baked potato or something.

2252
02:32:33,295 --> 02:32:34,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I see.

2253
02:32:34,296 --> 02:32:36,158
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure these walls are really insulated.

2254
02:32:36,198 --> 02:32:37,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

2255
02:32:37,279 --> 02:32:37,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

2256
02:32:37,860 --> 02:32:38,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

2257
02:32:38,320 --> 02:32:39,821
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2258
02:32:58,268 --> 02:33:02,509
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see if that's feasible or not, depending on where I actually have to record and the times and that kind of stuff.

2259
02:33:03,249 --> 02:33:04,349
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to livestream it.

2260
02:33:04,369 --> 02:33:06,230
[SPEAKER_12]: At the very least, it's going to go up on YouTube.

2261
02:33:06,950 --> 02:33:10,131
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want some sort of interactivity with that.

2262
02:33:10,191 --> 02:33:13,411
[SPEAKER_12]: So obviously, chat room will be involved.

2263
02:33:13,711 --> 02:33:18,372
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to actually have polls at different parts during it.

2264
02:33:18,392 --> 02:33:23,694
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is going to be, I think, what concept should we go ahead... Because I can make anything.

2265
02:33:23,774 --> 02:33:25,414
[SPEAKER_12]: So what are we going to make...

2266
02:33:26,694 --> 02:33:32,436
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll come up with a couple ideas and maybe people vote on it and we'll go from there and later on as we get more into it.

2267
02:33:32,956 --> 02:33:38,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And hell, I don't know if I'll actually create a game in 24 hours because I've never made anything before, but I think I can do it.

2268
02:33:38,558 --> 02:33:40,139
[SPEAKER_11]: I love how you're doing your game jams.

2269
02:33:40,219 --> 02:33:43,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never made a game before, but I'm pretty sure I can do one in 24 hours.

2270
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:43,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

2271
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:45,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2272
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:46,541
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll try it.

2273
02:33:46,601 --> 02:33:49,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, hell, I've watched a video where someone made a game in three minutes.

2274
02:33:50,022 --> 02:33:51,062
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it can be done.

2275
02:33:51,122 --> 02:33:52,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be a good game?

2276
02:33:52,843 --> 02:33:53,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

2277
02:33:54,083 --> 02:33:54,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

2278
02:33:54,840 --> 02:34:00,628
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the noob night that Bobby and I keep talking about for Borderlands 2, except your noob night is programming.

2279
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:02,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it'd be fun.

2280
02:34:02,370 --> 02:34:03,551
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of want to do it.

2281
02:34:03,592 --> 02:34:06,395
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, as Bobby suggested, make a poll on the forum.

2282
02:34:06,415 --> 02:34:10,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I'll start off with doing that, and we'll do updates in there and stuff.

2283
02:34:11,241 --> 02:34:13,002
[SPEAKER_12]: See where it goes, because I think it'd be fun.

2284
02:34:13,102 --> 02:34:15,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you should try to make one of the OLR Dream games.

2285
02:34:15,082 --> 02:34:16,603
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, see, I knew you would say that.

2286
02:34:16,803 --> 02:34:19,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew you would say that, but here's why I don't want to do that.

2287
02:34:19,223 --> 02:34:21,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if I'm going to make one of those, it's got to be a good game.

2288
02:34:21,524 --> 02:34:24,485
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to make my first experiment at something that's going to suck.

2289
02:34:25,625 --> 02:34:28,066
[SPEAKER_12]: One of those games, no offense.

2290
02:34:28,126 --> 02:34:30,987
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd rather do it when I'm able to make something a little bit better.

2291
02:34:32,007 --> 02:34:32,948
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a dream game after all.

2292
02:34:32,968 --> 02:34:35,349
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to just crap out something.

2293
02:34:35,749 --> 02:34:36,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

2294
02:34:36,270 --> 02:34:39,071
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to make sure that the time is taken to get it right.

2295
02:34:39,091 --> 02:34:42,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Besides, I have a lot of really crazy ideas for things.

2296
02:34:42,093 --> 02:34:44,554
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, all sorts of silly things.

2297
02:34:45,395 --> 02:34:48,617
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let me quickly go to some tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

2298
02:34:49,697 --> 02:34:50,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at a few tweets here.

2299
02:34:51,779 --> 02:34:57,522
[SPEAKER_11]: SS2100Matt tweeted us about going to EA's NHL 94 anniversary mode party in New York City.

2300
02:34:58,022 --> 02:35:03,786
[SPEAKER_11]: and he actually took some footage that he posted over on Facebook and yeah, I saw that earlier in the week and it looks pretty cool.

2301
02:35:04,146 --> 02:35:17,394
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how they put that mode in there to kind of, you know, with the stars under the player and all that to kind of go back to the classic and I heard EA didn't really like him taking some of that footage but I'm glad his rogue footage made it to Facebook after all.

2302
02:35:18,334 --> 02:35:19,755
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw is sending us a couple tweets.

2303
02:35:20,536 --> 02:35:23,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Oculus Rift is planned for PC and mobile but consoles?

2304
02:35:23,397 --> 02:35:24,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a focus.

2305
02:35:24,158 --> 02:35:24,558
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2306
02:35:24,798 --> 02:35:31,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I suppose would go a ways in... Wasn't there some rumor about PlayStation 4 getting Oculus Rift at some point?

2307
02:35:31,705 --> 02:35:34,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say right around E3 there was some wank on that.

2308
02:35:34,227 --> 02:35:36,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, it can support any platform.

2309
02:35:36,169 --> 02:35:38,111
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just... It's HDMI inputs.

2310
02:35:38,352 --> 02:35:43,797
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically... It just has to output that display and it can work with pretty much anything.

2311
02:35:43,917 --> 02:35:46,540
[SPEAKER_12]: So... Well, actually, no.

2312
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,060
[SPEAKER_12]: I take that back.

2313
02:35:47,100 --> 02:35:48,662
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit more complex than that, but...

2314
02:35:49,042 --> 02:35:51,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think they said consoles at one time.

2315
02:35:52,244 --> 02:35:57,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, if it has native support for Unreal 4, both consoles can run that.

2316
02:35:58,449 --> 02:36:04,373
[SPEAKER_12]: And Source... I'm not really sure what other engines are going to be supporting it natively, but...

2317
02:36:04,993 --> 02:36:06,735
[SPEAKER_12]: and more and more are supporting it.

2318
02:36:06,795 --> 02:36:07,996
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wouldn't see why not.

2319
02:36:08,356 --> 02:36:08,616
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2320
02:36:09,437 --> 02:36:13,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Tiger Claw letting us know that a new side-scrolling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game is coming in October.

2321
02:36:15,641 --> 02:36:17,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Activision talked about this in a press release.

2322
02:36:17,423 --> 02:36:19,665
[SPEAKER_11]: It's based on the Nickelodeon version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

2323
02:36:19,685 --> 02:36:20,945
[SPEAKER_07]: You know they're doing a new movie, right?

2324
02:36:21,186 --> 02:36:21,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I knew that.

2325
02:36:21,726 --> 02:36:22,587
[SPEAKER_07]: With Megan Fox.

2326
02:36:23,621 --> 02:36:24,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I heard about that.

2327
02:36:26,344 --> 02:36:26,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Pass.

2328
02:36:28,386 --> 02:36:34,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, lastly, Spazinator on Twitter wants to know, after the show's over, anyone up for a game of Left 4 Dead 2?

2329
02:36:35,633 --> 02:36:37,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if not Left 4 Dead 2, then Civ 4.

2330
02:36:38,058 --> 02:36:39,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up for a game of driving home

2331
02:36:58,667 --> 02:37:01,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Go meet Raginator, Spazinator, whatever he's called.

2332
02:37:01,909 --> 02:37:04,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Go meet him in our VOG Network group and get a game going.

2333
02:37:05,210 --> 02:37:07,251
[SPEAKER_11]: He wants to kill some zombies with you.

2334
02:37:07,752 --> 02:37:08,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun.

2335
02:37:09,192 --> 02:37:09,493
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2336
02:37:10,133 --> 02:37:12,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess that's going to do it for our Skype line tonight.

2337
02:37:13,234 --> 02:37:16,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess it's going to start to do it for the end of our show.

2338
02:37:16,576 --> 02:37:18,377
[SPEAKER_11]: It's starting to get really hot in here, you guys.

2339
02:37:18,877 --> 02:37:24,080
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a hot day in Sacramento, and then we're running the oven right now because I guess Alan started dinner, so it's like...

2340
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:24,940
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2341
02:37:51,269 --> 02:38:18,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder how long it's going to take me to get all those gummy bears My final thought is I'm going to need to really convince myself not to buy Rogue Legacy while it's at least 20% off during the Steam sale and I was holding out for a deeper discount or else I'm probably going to end up buying that later tonight because I do want to get that I've heard a lot of good things about it

2342
02:38:19,212 --> 02:38:19,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn it.

2343
02:38:20,273 --> 02:38:21,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn you, Steam Sale.

2344
02:38:21,533 --> 02:38:22,714
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have gotten Little Inferno.

2345
02:38:23,134 --> 02:38:23,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn you.

2346
02:38:23,894 --> 02:38:24,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you have it?

2347
02:38:24,615 --> 02:38:25,295
[SPEAKER_11]: I still might.

2348
02:38:25,395 --> 02:38:25,975
