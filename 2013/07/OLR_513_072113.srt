00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, July 21, 2013, a long-awaited Nintendo classic finally hits Wii U Virtual Console,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
a dormant franchise re-emerges with a new game announcement at Comic-Con, and things get heated with one EA Sports franchise.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number 513, July 21, 2013.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about all things video gaming

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And, of course, my co-hosts, not here right now, DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers, she is running a little late tonight.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
She has more of those home buying, being an adult things that she's doing right now,

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but she'll be joining us, hopefully momentarily, within the next 30 minutes or so.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But, in the meantime, joining me live in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm working on a bag of three pounds of gummy bears.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I was going to say, you brought a lot of different stuff with you, fun things to the show tonight.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What are these things you brought to the studio with you? A giant package of Haribo gummy bears.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And not that I'm complaining, gummy bears are amazing, but that's three pounds. That's a lot of candy.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will eat it until it makes me sick. It's one of these things, we had a coupon from our local grocery store

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
where you spend 50 bucks and you get 10 bucks back.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And so, I bought all of our groceries for the week, and they're pretty affordable as it is.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And so, I get to the counter and it's like, yeah, you have $47. I'm like, crap, I need something else.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I was like, okay, well, maybe I'll get some M&M's. Ah, they're the crappy pretzel M&M's.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Gummy bears!

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So, you know, that kind of paid for itself.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There you go. Well, gummy bears are always exciting, and you know I'm going to steal some before the night is over.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So, you've kind of had a busy week, and before we get into our gaming weeks and all that stuff,

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I want to talk to you about some of the variety of things that's gone on this week.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But, of course, I do want to introduce the always-present fourth guest in our show, the chat room.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And even though Bobby's opinion on games sometimes can be very wrong,

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we do still support all our indie podcast friends, even when they don't agree with you that Super Metroid is the greatest game ever made.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I mean, geez, how can somebody not think that?

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But, diversity, I suppose. We have to embrace a diverse environment.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's fine. It's going to be the greatest game ever made up until Grand Theft Auto V comes out, and then, you know.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Things might change. You are trying to pressure me into the Grand Theft Auto V.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I might have to do it. You know, I've been taking a break from the MMOs lately,

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
because all my friends quit World of Warcraft, basically.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, I shouldn't say all. I have some friends that play World of Warcraft still, but very few.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Like, I signed in for the first time today in, like, six days, and I had a bunch of friends that were like,

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
oh my gosh, where have you been?

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But, I've been really able to catch up on a lot of single-player games, like Steam and stuff like that,

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
which I'll get into in my gaming week, but Grand Theft Auto IV is still sitting there on the list of things I need to do.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You need to play it.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, I know. I know I do.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Alright, going to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Rambo wants to know, are they vodka-infused gummy bears?

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, not yet.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, it's more like heat-infused gummy bears that have been sitting in my car.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And I've actually seen it before. What happens if they sit in my car for a very long time,

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
it will literally conform to the bag, and it'll be just one solid mass of gummy bears.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
LokiLives46, I don't know if that's in reference to your name, or if you just both happen to be Loki,

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
but LokiLives46 says that's almost a gross amount of sugar, man.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I won't eat them all in one day, because it seriously, right now, it feels like I have a weight in my stomach.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Because I just finished eating dinner, and then I had this.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, gummy bears expand in your stomach, you know.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, I didn't know.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No, I'm kidding. I don't know. I'm just messing with you.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Alright, so some of the other fun things you did with your week.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I love it when you bring presents to the show with you, and tonight you brought presents.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You brought this little Lego kit where you can actually build your own little, just tiny little Star Trek Enterprise.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's one of those mini, it comes in like the plastic bag things, and you know, it's not too difficult.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was building during Bobby's show, and well, not the whole thing, like the last ten minutes, I'm already almost done.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But where did you get this from, and what's been going on?

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I got it from the Namco band I rep, because they came to my work this week.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We do this kind of, what used to be a game summit, now it's like an entertainment summit,

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
because they have a couple movie studios coming, now there's also the other things that we sell as well,

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
including Wonder Chalk, which is like this modeling chocolate stuff now.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So yeah, so they had a bunch of game companies out and stuff, and they show us what's coming out.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I got to see a few different, we'll talk about some of the stuff in gaming week I guess,

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
but I got to see a few different things. There's a few guys that brought dev kits with them.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ubisoft brought Splinter Cell Blacklist, so I got to play a little of that.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Tecmo Koe, they brought Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z, so I got to play the E3 demo of that.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I didn't actually play it, but Activision brought Skylanders, Swap Force.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I did fondle the toys a little bit, because there was no one at the booth at the time,

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
so I was looking at them, and the top and bottom halves are held together with magnets.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
As you would expect, I guess. Very disappointed that Disney did not...

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Magnets! How did they work?

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was very disappointed that Disney did not bring their Disney Infinity stuff.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They only had a video, which I've already seen.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And what else?

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, it's neat that they were able to bring stuff to your work at all,

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
because there's other game stuff going on right now.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There's a lot of stuff going on at Comic Con, it seems even more gaming news this year than usual.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And then PAX Australia, which oddly haven't been hearing a lot coming out of PAX Australia.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I forgot it was even this week.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't think there was a lot of news to break.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sure some great local news and some indie news that just hasn't shown up on my radar yet,

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
because I've been too obsessed with the Steam sale and Earthbound and all that.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But there hasn't really been a lot of news broken at PAX Australia,

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
but I'm sure it's been really cool for them to just experience PAX,

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and getting all the nerds in one place and the big gaming rooms and all that.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But my favorite part about the whole thing was actually something that didn't even take place.

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, it took place at the event, but more of the after event, like the dinner.

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, so I have a couple reps that work at different companies.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
One guy, my friend Daniel, he's worked at a bunch of different companies.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've known him since he's worked at Konami, Namco, he's working at D3 now.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And then there's also Len, who actually owns a company now.

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He owns Maximum Family Games.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They do a lot of family product.

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Recently they've been doing some of these Xbox Live Arcade titles come to disc version.

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They just released the Serious Sam collection on 360,

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and they had the Worms collection back in May on PS3 and 360 and stuff like that.

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But that's not the thing.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So they've been in the industry forever, like ever and ever.

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And before, they used to both work at Sega a long time ago,

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
like back when they were launching the Genesis a long time ago and stuff.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And so they were telling me so many stories.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It was just fantastic.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
First off, Len was telling me stories about how, since he owns the company and stuff,

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
they deal a lot with shipping to Brazil and stuff and about all the difficulties with that

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and how you get product in there and stuff and how you have to almost bribe officials

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and stuff to get things in there is crazy.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But the stories from Sega were great.

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They were talking about how they came up with, I guess they announced the core system

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
for the Sega Genesis at CES one of these years or something.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And they were telling, I guess everyone was saying,

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, well, that's a brilliant idea and stuff.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Because it was the first time that they had ever come out with a game system

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
that was actually called a core system.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's kind of surprising that they've never released a game system

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
without a game packed in before or something cheaper, I guess.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But he was just saying, yeah, they literally came up with that idea the night before.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Some guy went to Kinko's, had the box printed up, and they put it on the roof,

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
covered it with some sort of tarp thing and then revealed it at CES.

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But just a whole lot of things talking about how they were asking him,

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
so what do you guys think about the 32X?

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Do you think this is going to be something that's going to work for consumers and stuff

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and how they're saying it's such a bad idea and everything?

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know. It just sounded like a lot of fun.

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I wish I could have got the guys on the show to talk about that kind of stuff,

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
but obviously they don't want a lot of the stuff coming back verbatim.

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Some people would get butthurt about that kind of stuff.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, total derailment here, but you're in the background of my Vine.

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Can I still post that?

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, I don't care.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Just making sure.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I always ask permission before I post people's face on the internet,

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
but I wanted to show off my Lego Enterprise because I finished.

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There you go.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, I'm glad you got to reminisce with people and old friends

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
that have moved from company to company and catch up on some of the drums, right?

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, it's fun.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And then also my other friend from, I guess it's not really a publisher,

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
but he's a rep firm.

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He works with, oh, what is it now?

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's Watt & Company.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He works with them.

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't know.

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There's a lot of these guys I've seen for a long time

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
because they've been here every single year.

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There's a few reps that cycle through and stuff.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I did get to meet with Microsoft.

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, my God.

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I swear to God.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
One thing you'll learn about Microsoft if you're in the industry and stuff

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and if you actually get face-to-face contact with some of these reps,

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
they're different than everybody else.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You'll talk to them, and you get this vibe from them.

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's just very much the Microsoft way of doing things.

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
For example, we were actually sitting down and having lunch,

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and my coworkers started asking them questions about the Xbox One

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and all the critical stuff about the Xbox One and stuff,

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and just listening to the guys spin stuff.

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I mean, obviously, he's kind of along the lines with how we're thinking.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's really early, and a lot of this stuff is going to change,

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
so you can't really say too much about what it's going to be in the final product

168
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
considering that they can just turn around.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But just like such the, well, we were listening to the consumers and blah, blah, blah.

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
For example, I set up items for a company.

171
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I set up items, and I don't have any of the first-party setup information,

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
so I asked Microsoft, hey, can you provide me a list of the UPCs

173
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
for the stuff that you have coming out?

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, we're sorry, because you see, you guys don't really buy direct from us,

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
so you're going to have to ask somebody else.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What the fuck?

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, but we're supporting you guys.

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's why we're out here today.

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What? Okay, fine.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You can't give me stuff to set up the items in our system so that we can sell your product.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I just won't bother pushing for that since.

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We'll just not sell your product then.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't know.

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The whole thing's a corporate script.

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The whole thing is ridiculous.

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This was the weird thing at E3, too,

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
is that there was just such the corporate script that nobody was going to deviate from.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Basically, everything benefits them.

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
They say they're thinking about the consumer, but it's always what's going to benefit Microsoft,

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and that's what it comes down to.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's everything that I've talked to them and listening to their spiel and stuff like that.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This isn't something new.

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This has been around since the first year of Microsoft.

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's never about here's the upcoming games we have and stuff like that.

195
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You guys need to sell more of our accessories.

196
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You need to sell more.

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is how you should be upselling these games.

198
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
When someone orders a Halo 4, you should ask them,

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
do you want a year of live with that, too?

200
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Dude, first off, I'm not selling retail, for one.

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And two, my customers order live cards when they need them and stuff.

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They don't need to be pushed for that stuff.

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I remember the first year.

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is when the Xbox 360 launched.

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Our guy, who is actually higher up now,

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
he's like, yeah, you guys need to be selling.

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You need to be pushing the accessories.

208
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Cool, but you're not shipping any to us because they're allocated.

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We want to order them.

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We're trying to sell them, but you're not shipping any.

211
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And now you're telling us that we need to push them,

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
but we can't because you're not shipping any to us.

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's hilarious.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's like banging your head against the wall.

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, the line is that's the stuff they're trying to sell and push.

216
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Sony on the other hand, I must add, asked them the same thing.

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Hey, I need setup information for UPCs.

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Guy gives me his card.

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He says, send me an email and I'll get you the information you need.

220
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Was that so fucking hard?

221
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And guess what?

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We don't buy direct from them either.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So perfect example.

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It shouldn't be that difficult to get information from them to sell their product.

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah.

226
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What he just said.

227
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Hi.

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Welcome to the show.

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
How are you?

230
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hopeful.

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You smell like sandwich.

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Did you bring a sandwich?

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I brought Panda.

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, okay.

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You were so wrong.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I haven't eaten all day.

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's fine.

238
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's fine.

239
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
All right.

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Loki, one other thing I want to ask you about,

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
especially now that Dark Soccer is here to hear this,

242
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
the Ouya thing you've been tweeting about.

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh God.

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah.

245
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Come on.

246
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What's up with the Ouya stuff?

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay.

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So since I've gotten my Ouya,

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't even know if you've noticed on that controller that,

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
since you're borrowing the system now,

251
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
the analog six are fucked up.

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Basically.

253
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I just thought that was part of the system.

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No.

255
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No.

256
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's actually the analog six.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Because if you play with a PS3 controller, it works just fine.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But the analog six are fucked up.

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
They have like these really weird dead zones on them where if you try to move diagonally,

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
it's like it doesn't,

261
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
it registers you pushing it almost like a quarter of the way instead of all the way.

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's just not, it doesn't work right.

263
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Like if you try to run in circles, it looks really weird.

264
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So it was a defect.

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It was a defect that was in the first run of those controllers.

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And it's something that's documented.

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And it's something I tested and I saw the same thing that they came up with.

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So I've been trying to get it replaced recently.

269
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Because I know they've been busy with the launch and stuff,

270
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and it's just getting a hold of customer service.

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I started my claim,

272
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
or I should say my support ticket back in June on the 25th.

273
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And the first response I got from them was kind of a canned response.

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Because everyone's asking, you know, where's my OUYA system?

275
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So it was all this information about, you know, when your OUYA system's coming

276
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and when, you know, how to track it and all that stuff.

277
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm like, well, if you read the ticket I sent you,

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
it has nothing to do with what I've been asking.

279
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And then so finally I got a response from,

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and the guy sent me this RMA thing, so I filled it all out,

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
took a picture of the serial number and stuff,

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and I hadn't heard from him in two weeks.

283
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm like, okay.

284
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I keep responding back to the thread.

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm like, hey, where do we go from here?

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What's going on here?

287
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And so then finally he's like, I get a response back,

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
your replacement faceplates have been sent out

289
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
because I guess there's some problem with some of the faceplates,

290
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and so people are requesting the faceplates.

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Once again, didn't read anything that I sent them.

292
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You know, I'm like, dude, I don't need faceplates.

293
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I need a new controller.

294
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I can take the faceplates off,

295
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and the controller works just the same as it does now.

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's so weird that they wouldn't go back and read the notes unless,

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I mean, I wonder if it's not an outsource thing,

298
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
where if like certain words aren't there that, I mean,

299
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
a certain very literal script is usually followed in an outsource environment.

300
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It doesn't sound like, you know,

301
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I mean, unless they're just making up names,

302
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
but I mean, it's like Chad and, you know,

303
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
EA's does that.

304
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm just saying, so it took me filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau,

305
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
which they already have, you know,

306
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
it looks like a few complaints against them already.

307
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They're not part of the Better Business Bureau yet,

308
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and that didn't really do anything.

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So then I had a complaint on Twitter,

310
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and so finally got the attention of their community manager,

311
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and she kind of got the ball rolling a little bit,

312
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and I finally got another response saying that I was supposed to be,

313
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
he's forwarding my thing to the RMA department.

314
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So still, I don't have a fixed controller.

315
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I mean, literally, I could have gone out to the store,

316
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
it's not the right way to do it,

317
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
but I could have gone to the store, bought a brand new Ouia controller,

318
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and took it back, took my old controller back as defective,

319
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and got my money back, and could have had it replaced weeks ago,

320
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
but, you know, I wanted to do it through the proper channels,

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
although if I get dicked around for another couple weeks,

322
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I am going to do that.

323
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So that's where I'm at. I still don't have a fixed controller yet.

324
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What a mess.

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

326
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Customer service is so important.

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Their customer service is absolutely terrible.

328
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And then this goes just the full gamut.

329
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's just not been good at all.

330
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And yeah, I understand that they're a new company,

331
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
but come on, man.

332
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They've been dealing with customer service issues for the last three months now.

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They should be a little bit more on top of it.

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I mean, just even getting back to people,

335
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you know, in a timely manner, or reading the email.

336
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
If you're getting a read back, you know, respond back to somebody,

337
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
read through what the whole problem is when you're saying,

338
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
oh, I'm going to send you replacement faceplates.

339
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's not going to fucking fix the problem.

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't know. It's just, it's strange.

341
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But, and now they've got, like, some more news about what they're trying to do,

342
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the drive-up sales and stuff,

343
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and even, like, their response to the NPD numbers this month.

344
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They're saying, oh, yeah, the Ouia launch hasn't been very successful

345
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
because they haven't sold that many units.

346
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They're like, well, we sold out of all of our units.

347
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We're chasing demand right now.

348
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah, because your manufacturing is so fucking slow.

349
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But, I don't know, it's, I'm just kind of over that system already.

350
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's kind of felt like it was a whole mistake to back it in the first place, but.

351
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, Dan said he wanted one.

352
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And I'm like, no, we're not getting one.

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm putting my foot down.

354
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's not, it's not terrible.

355
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's, and I think it's going to get better because it's just a system right now.

356
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You know, it's all up to the developers and what they're, you know,

357
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
coming out with and stuff.

358
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And they even had some stuff that came out of their, like,

359
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
little game jam thing that they did that looked really cool,

360
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but not a lot of it's actually been made yet.

361
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Like, there's a game called Television that I wanted to play.

362
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It was kind of this weird, like, almost like a WarioWare type of game.

363
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And it just hasn't come out yet, but it looked kind of cool.

364
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And they've got some other games that look really neat on them,

365
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
plus you can sideload stuff.

366
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But a lot of the stuff that they promised, like,

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
that was going to be easily routable.

368
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Like, they were going to basically have almost like a one button root for it.

369
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That hasn't happened.

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And, hell, it can't even access, you know, external storage devices yet.

371
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
None of that stuff's happened.

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It can't, you know, it doesn't have any sort of online multiplayer.

373
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There's no, like, any, you know, sharing of, like, friend,

374
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
there's no friends list things built into it.

375
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
There's nothing.

376
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's just very rushed, I guess.

377
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
WhatupG asks in chat, who has great customer service?

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I can think of a few companies.

379
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll say my car insurance company, AAA, has always been really good to me.

380
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can't really complain about them at all.

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I would say the masters of customer service.

382
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I've never seen anyone do it better.

383
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Disney. Disneyland.

384
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, but I'm saying as far as game industry,

385
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I actually had really good customer service with Blizzard.

386
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah.

387
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The two times I've had to call, I had really good service.

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't like how long I've had to wait in some of the hold times,

389
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
but once you get through to somebody, yeah,

390
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
my experiences with Blizzard has been good.

391
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I can't complain.

392
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The best, or one of the best is supposed to be Zappos,

393
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
but I've never really ordered from them,

394
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
although I've met them, met the people at the company,

395
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and they're all really great.

396
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
They're all shoes, right?

397
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
They're shoes and clothing and stuff.

398
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
They did get into electronics for a while.

399
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I actually sold them games for a little bit,

400
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but they're really great.

401
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I mean, just everybody there is fantastic.

402
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They're a very unique corporate culture, too.

403
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It really works for them.

404
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's really cool.

405
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
None of the executives have offices there.

406
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
They're all down there in cubicles with everybody,

407
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and it's just very, it's good morale,

408
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and just everybody is really happy to work there,

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and I think that's how you do it.

410
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You keep people happy, and they will be happy.

411
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I mean, if they're pissed off at their job,

412
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
they're not going to be happy to your customers.

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The place that I just got hired for believes the same thing,

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and everyone looked super happy there.

415
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm not going to say where I got hired, but still.

416
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Technist in Chat says,

417
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Costco has amazing customer service.

418
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Returns with no question asked.

419
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
They changed some of that policy lately.

420
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean, I think they still probably have

421
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
the most liberal return policy in most companies,

422
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
but it's not as crazy as it used to be.

423
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Tiger Claw asks, Rob, you're a corporate trainer.

424
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Do you teach customer service?

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I did for seven years, and obviously,

426
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
just due to separating my day job and my hobby,

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm not going to tell you where I work,

428
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
or much more than that, but yes,

429
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I taught customer service for seven years,

430
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and I actually still, even though,

431
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I am still a corporate trainer.

432
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I teach something else.

433
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I sometimes teach customer service elements,

434
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and I still write some manuals relating to that,

435
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
so that's why it's important to me,

436
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and I think a lot of companies,

437
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I hate it when they let it go,

438
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
because one of the biggest things about customer service

439
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
is just having to have the mentality.

440
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You want to do good things.

441
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's 90% of it right there, so anyway,

442
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I won't get into too much more than that.

443
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
A lot of people in chat saying Amazon.

444
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Rama's saying Newegg is great customer service.

445
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Bonds006 says, how can I forget Nintendo?

446
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
They have yet to let me down.

447
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And I've worked in customer service

448
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
for a solid eight years, so trust me,

449
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
when you're in it, you know what not to do.

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I've called people out on stuff.

451
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah, and I've actually, when I get good phone service,

452
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
which I can't remember the last company I got it from.

453
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's just been, I don't actually call places a whole lot.

454
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I kind of prefer to do interactions online myself,

455
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but the last time I called somebody,

456
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I asked such good customer service,

457
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I actually said, can I talk to your manager

458
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and leave a compliment?

459
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You know what I usually do?

460
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
They love that.

461
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Actually, it's even better.

462
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
If you like someone's job,

463
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
ask for the fax number, fax them a letter,

464
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
because when I worked in customer service before,

465
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
verbal compliments were really good,

466
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
but written compliments were like the gold star,

467
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
they were the diamond star.

468
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah, and if you're willing to do that,

469
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
not waste your time, spend your time doing something like that,

470
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
you know, that, you know.

471
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I got 14 of them in one year.

472
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I got taken out to dinner five times.

473
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Little did show off.

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
No, it was that one year that we were so super busy

475
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and I worked all that overtime,

476
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
but I actually just sort of gave up on the call time

477
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and ended up helping out whoever it was,

478
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
because it was really freaking busy.

479
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And it's one thing when you have 255 calls in queue,

480
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and your queue max is 255.

481
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah.

482
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Anyway, I don't know how we got on that.

483
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Oh, yeah, we have stuff.

484
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But anyway, anything else about your antics this week

485
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
you want to share with us, Loki,

486
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
before we get into gaming weeks?

487
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's pretty much it.

488
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
All right, let's get into how was your gaming week

489
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and the types of video games

490
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
that you have been playing this week.

491
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

492
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Animal Crossing.

493
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Still?

494
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yep.

495
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Ooh, is my DS around?

496
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I got to make sure.

497
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I got to make sure our 3DS is mate.

498
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I turned mine on.

499
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Mine's been on all day.

500
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Actually, when I went to South Sac yesterday,

501
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I straight passed two people there.

502
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I have no idea who,

503
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
but there were two people in South Sac,

504
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
so if you're listening, I straight passed you totally.

505
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And then, yeah, I actually, let's see,

506
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I've just expanded my second room.

507
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So I've expanded my upstairs,

508
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I've expanded my house twice,

509
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the upstairs once, my side room once,

510
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
my other side room once,

511
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and now I'm going to be expanding my basement.

512
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I have like 56,000 bills left.

513
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Okay, anyone who wants a tip,

514
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
fish on the island.

515
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Fish on the island, cat sharks.

516
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Throw everything back if they're not a shark.

517
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I've heard beetles on the island.

518
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah, some of the beetles, not all of them.

519
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The Goliath ones are worth some money.

520
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And that's, oh, and I finished Little Inferno.

521
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That game is weird.

522
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That was the one where you set things on fire, right?

523
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yes, I love that game.

524
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Good times.

525
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And that's really about it,

526
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
because I've been job interviewing.

527
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I've been shopping for professional clothes.

528
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But congrats, you got the job,

529
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and I know you don't want to say,

530
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
well, you'll tell me all about it off air, but.

531
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I pretty much knew I had it right after the interview,

532
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
because they're already talking about other stuff.

533
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's a good feeling.

534
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well, congrats.

535
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And the company is really reputable.

536
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm not going to say anything,

537
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
because I do want that window of separation.

538
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah, we all do.

539
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But they're a really good, reputable,

540
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
long-standing company who got very high ratings

541
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
for how well they take care of their employees.

542
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Wow.

543
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Well, what a positive time between that and the house stuff.

544
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And then, yeah, we found two really good houses today,

545
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
and we put out an offer on one of them today.

546
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Nice.

547
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And a little two-bedroom house,

548
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but we have a big office in it.

549
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, well, fingers and toes crossed.

550
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And my own bathroom.

551
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
All right.

552
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So, yeah.

553
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Fingers, is that the one out,

554
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I guess I can say Antelope.

555
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Was that the one at Antelope?

556
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
An Antelope.

557
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That's going to be a bit of a drive.

558
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It'd be a schlep,

559
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
but it'd be a watt to 50 for me to get to work.

560
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That's not bad.

561
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
All right.

562
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

563
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I played lots of stuff this week.

564
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So, some stuff out of the little game show thing.

565
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I played a brief demo.

566
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It was the E3 demo for Yiba Ninja Gaiden Z,

567
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
which honestly plays just like Ninja Gaiden,

568
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
except what's kind of cool is the zombies,

569
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
you can cut off their hands and stuff,

570
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and they turn into different weapons.

571
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So, like, I cut off some of the arms,

572
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and they turn into almost like a nunchuck.

573
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I managed to crash the demo at the end,

574
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
because I was supposed to,

575
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
there was supposed to be this zombie

576
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
that you throw into a car,

577
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and he's supposed to drive this truck into,

578
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
like, this sex shop or whatever,

579
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and panties are supposed to fly out,

580
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
because, you know, it's awesome.

581
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Instead, somehow, it let me kill the zombie,

582
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and then I couldn't finish the demo,

583
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
which is kind of funny.

584
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But I've already seen how it ends, so,

585
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
yeah, it wasn't that big a deal.

586
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And then I played a bit of Splinter Cell Conviction,

587
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
which, honestly, I have, or not Conviction,

588
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Splinter Cell Blacklist, that's a new one.

589
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Never really played a Splinter Cell game.

590
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's kind of fun, you know, a self-action game.

591
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I do like the new little gimmick that they have in there,

592
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
where you can mark different targets,

593
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and then you do this, you hit a button to execute them,

594
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and then it does it, like, all cinematic,

595
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and it's kind of neat.

596
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Apparently, that's only available in the lower difficulties,

597
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
which I was playing on Rookie,

598
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
because I just didn't care.

599
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And, I don't know, it was a fun game.

600
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Not one I'm probably going to pick up,

601
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
because it's not my style of gameplay,

602
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
but it looks good, so it was fun.

603
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
What else?

604
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I played more Super Meat Boy.

605
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I pretty much got all the A pluses for the first level.

606
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm working on the second level,

607
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and that includes both the dark and light worlds,

608
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and I got all of the bandages.

609
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So, then I have...

610
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Who did I unlock?

611
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I unlocked the robot from Macarium, I think,

612
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and then also...

613
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Oh, what's his name?

614
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I don't even remember who it was.

615
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Just a bunch of other characters.

616
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh, the alien from Alien Hominid,

617
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and some other character.

618
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I don't even know who it is.

619
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's from some other indie game.

620
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm trying to get the guy from Minecraft,

621
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
because he has the coolest kind of special attack.

622
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
He can actually dig through the level.

623
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Shadownextchan in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

624
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Loki, the mark and shoot mechanic,

625
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
was also in Splinter Cell Conviction.

626
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You should check it out.

627
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Okay.

628
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And then, before the show,

629
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I got sent the beta for Mercenary Kings,

630
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
which is a game I backed on Kickstarter,

631
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and it's awesome.

632
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It looks very much like a...

633
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Like a Metal Slug, but it's not.

634
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You can craft weapons in the game,

635
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
because you collect things.

636
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's really hard,

637
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and all really awesome hand-drawn pixel art.

638
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't know.

639
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I played it for about 15 minutes,

640
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and it was pretty sweet.

641
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I never finished the first level,

642
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
because I had no fucking clue

643
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
where I was supposed to be going.

644
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I was supposed to be rescuing one guy,

645
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and I went all through the level,

646
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
because it kind of plays a little Metroidvania, I guess.

647
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
They're very open levels,

648
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
but since I have no map,

649
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
or don't know where I'm supposed to be going,

650
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I kind of wandered the level for a while,

651
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and couldn't find who I was supposed to be rescuing,

652
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
because you have a time limit.

653
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But yeah, it looks awesome,

654
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and hopefully I get the full game pretty soon.

655
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I know, I think the Shadowrun Returns game

656
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
should be coming out pretty soon.

657
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I've got that, so I should be getting that,

658
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and also Shadowrun Online,

659
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
whenever the hell that comes out.

660
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So both of those.

661
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I need to check on Shadowgate Returns.

662
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I know I backed that kick,

663
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
so I've only backed two, maybe.

664
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Oh, no, no, because there were the two recently,

665
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
because we had them both on the network

666
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
that I backed.

667
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But then there was also,

668
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm starting to see the rewards for GamerCon,

669
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
or as they call it, GamerX,

670
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
is next weekend.

671
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That's actually happening,

672
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
which is pretty cool.

673
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So I'm just financing reaping the rewards of that.

674
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And then Shadowgate was the only other thing

675
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I've ever kickstarted

676
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
outside of the Professor Shy Guy thing.

677
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So I'm still waiting for that to come out,

678
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
which I think is later this year,

679
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
so I'm excited about that.

680
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah, so I think that's all I played this week.

681
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I wanted to play some other stuff.

682
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I installed a few games.

683
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So, yeah, that's it.

684
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Although there's going to be lots of taking up of time,

685
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
so I don't know if I'll get into a lot of these games.

686
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I just need to do the third.

687
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Still have a few achievements left I need to get.

688
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Okay.

689
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So my gaming week.

690
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I've played quite a bit of different things,

691
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
just kind of like a potpourri of stuff.

692
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And I think not playing MMOs right now,

693
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
because I'm kind of holding out.

694
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I know Final Fantasy XIV,

695
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Realm Reborn is going to be the next big thing

696
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I get sucked into,

697
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
but it's not really out until mid-August,

698
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
whenever the early launch

699
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and the next beta phase happen and all that.

700
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So I'm kind of in this lull right now.

701
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
World of Warcraft,

702
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
most of my friends are on hiatus.

703
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
They've either just gone off to play other things,

704
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
or they're going to play XIV,

705
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
or they quit, or whatever.

706
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
There's just not a lot of people still playing WoW.

707
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
There's just a couple people I still run into,

708
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
but not a lot.

709
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So I sign into WoW maybe once every few days,

710
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
play a PvP battleground,

711
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
try to talk to people,

712
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
but that's about it.

713
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So I've been using this time

714
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
to kind of catch up on single-player things

715
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and Steam Sale, obviously,

716
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
has been a huge contributor to that.

717
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The trading card metagame.

718
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I actually did my badge today for the summer sale,

719
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
so I got my summer sale badge,

720
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
and it gave me a friends list boost to five people.

721
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Not everybody would get that.

722
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That's just, I think you get a random loot.

723
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And I got a background for my profile,

724
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
so now when you go visit my profile on Steam,

725
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
which is, I think, GreenSky42 is my external name,

726
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
you can actually see my little trading card background.

727
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You know, just a silly thing.

728
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So, yeah, there was that.

729
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Thanks to that, I kind of was playing some more games on Steam.

730
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
A few things to note, Skyrim,

731
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I started randomly playing the other night,

732
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
because, you know, Skyrim is that game

733
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
you can just get sucked into.

734
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah, cards, partially cards.

735
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I got all of my cards in one sitting.

736
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That'll tell you how I got sucked into Skyrim one night, right?

737
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So there was that.

738
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But then the other game I got really sucked into,

739
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Torchlight 2.

740
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I bought it.

741
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I didn't play it, but I bought it.

742
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The last day of the sale is going on right now.

743
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
If you're listening to the podcast, you probably missed it.

744
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But if you're listening live,

745
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
that last day of the sale has all the encore sales going on right now,

746
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and I know Torchlight 2 is only five bucks.

747
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I already had the game, because I bought it when it first came out,

748
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
but I played it for like a little bit, and then I just, you know,

749
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
gamer ADD, I went and played something else.

750
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But I randomly decided to play it the other night to get trading cards,

751
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and I was doing a live stream of it,

752
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
because I've been getting into live streaming more

753
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
on my personal Twitch channel, which is just Rob Roberts on Twitch.

754
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I played some Torchlight 2 this week,

755
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and yeah, I played some more today,

756
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and my character's up to like level 18 or something,

757
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
so good times.

758
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Speaking of live streaming,

759
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
after the show last week,

760
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Shane made me play Slender the Eight Pages

761
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and do a live stream.

762
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh my god.

763
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That game was scary, but I beat his score.

764
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
He's only got as far as two pages.

765
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I got to three pages, but by sheer dumb luck.

766
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And I live streamed the whole thing,

767
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and I had the lights out, so like all you could see is my silhouette

768
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and the lights from Alan's computer,

769
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
because I had like my little webcam in the corner.

770
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's all in the archive on my channel at Twitch TV, Rob Roberts.

771
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And I did have a jump screen,

772
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
where I literally screamed once,

773
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and Shane, I just, he started laughing,

774
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and then I bust up laughing. It was really funny.

775
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But it was scary, like I was in this like bathroom area

776
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
looking for a page, and I turned the corner,

777
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and he was right there, and the music did the

778
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
BONG, and like the tentacles were coming out and everything,

779
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and I was like, ah! So I let out this big screech.

780
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So, that was fun.

781
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Even though, you know, I probably won't play that again anytime soon.

782
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But that was a good thrill for that.

783
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I also bought Final Fantasy VII on the Steam sale,

784
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
because it was on the Flash sale yesterday for eight hours.

785
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It was eight bucks, and I bought it.

786
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Not cheap enough yet.

787
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Well, here's the thing. There's some things I like about it.

788
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Even though the music in its MIDI form is kind of,

789
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
the graphics are improved.

790
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Like, I mean, I realize it's probably using a lot of

791
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
the same formulas from the PlayStation 1,

792
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
but like, the polygons there, they look crisp.

793
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Like, they look really good.

794
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But the whole cloud saving feature is busted.

795
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And I don't know if it's just because so many people bought it

796
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
when it went on the Flash sale yesterday,

797
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
but like, I could not save my game yesterday.

798
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That's very frustrating and stupid.

799
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Like, if the cloud thing doesn't work,

800
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the game should still let you save locally by default.

801
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But I could not save, and I streamed this whole thing happening.

802
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I couldn't save to a local file.

803
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That's ridiculous. Come on.

804
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Like, I realize that Square's trying to tie everything together online

805
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
to do the boost level thing and everything,

806
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
but it's ridiculous.

807
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It should always save locally, and then to the cloud.

808
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yes, right?

809
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So I have to really dog Final Fantasy VII for that cloud saving thing,

810
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
because it does more harm than good in this case.

811
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm hoping they fix it, but it did not leave a good impression.

812
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Like, who wants to replay the first hour of the game again, you know?

813
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I mean, well, I guess I did play it for the first time,

814
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
but like, the first time in a few years.

815
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Not the first time since yesterday.

816
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Jason in our chat room, vxjasonxv at live.hognetwork.com says,

817
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Cloud can't save Aeris. You expect him to save your game?

818
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Lol. I would hope.

819
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
My cloud would have stabbed her.

820
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Let's see. I'm also looking here.

821
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Tigerclaw says, Rob needs to play more scary games on Twitch.

822
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's a possibility. It's a possibility.

823
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm trying to play a variety of things. Just sometimes classic things.

824
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Too bad you don't have the Oculus Rift and then play like a Slender game.

825
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
No!

826
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You know what, by the way, Rob?

827
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I did remember one other video game related thing we did last night.

828
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We watched the live stream of video games live.

829
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh yeah, I saw part of that.

830
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It was pretty good.

831
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I decided to stream at the same time it was on,

832
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
which is probably why nobody was watching.

833
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm amused by David Hader's ponytail.

834
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Nice.

835
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Let's see, Ragenator says, speaking of streaming on Twitch, etc.

836
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
How would a total newbie like me stream on a site like that?

837
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's actually not too difficult.

838
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The program I use, which is great, is Open Broadcast Software?

839
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Open Broadcaster Source?

840
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I use FFSplit.

841
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Do you?

842
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

843
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh, no. I like Open Broadcaster.

844
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Look that one up because that one's great.

845
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I remember what I used because my computer had the format of the hard drive,

846
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
so I don't have my program anymore.

847
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
FFSplit, I did not get as good a performance out of that as I did.

848
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I mean, it's nice because that's free and everything,

849
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
but I got a better performance out of OBS.

850
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's see, also trying to read through our chat room real quick

851
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
at live.vognetwork.com.

852
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I guess that's it for now for chat comments,

853
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
but we'll get some more of these later.

854
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Some folks commenting on a story that's coming up.

855
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But I think I got everything in my gaming week.

856
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, one other thing I should throw out there.

857
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
On the Wii U this week, and I'm spoiling the news a little bit,

858
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
but it's my own story.

859
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Earthbound was out on the Wii U this week.

860
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I played a bit of that on Virtual Console.

861
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's nice to revisit that game after a very long time.

862
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I played it on emulators once, like years ago,

863
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
but to be able to play it again on the TV and on the little game pad

864
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
is a nice experience.

865
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
That is a great, great RPG, one of my all-time favorites.

866
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It really is.

867
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I know Bobby's been razzing me a little bit

868
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
about the whole Super Metroid versus Earthbound thing,

869
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
but I'm always kind of like,

870
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
but Earthbound really is a really good game,

871
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and I don't find Earthbound to be overrated.

872
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's not my favorite game, but it's probably in my top five, honestly.

873
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I love Earthbound. It's great.

874
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So, glad to be playing that again.

875
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And glad to hear they didn't really change a lot.

876
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
The changes they made, very minor stuff.

877
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
They made one dialogue change,

878
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and I don't even think it was that big a deal,

879
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
but they changed some of the graphic effects

880
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
to tone down the amazing seizure displays that some of the PSI effects had.

881
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You mean the embryos?

882
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Hmm?

883
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You mean the embryos?

884
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah, right.

885
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So, yeah, good times.

886
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Okay, so that's it for our Gaming Weeks.

887
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Quick housekeeping, twitter.com, excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR,

888
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
or facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio if you want to follow us.

889
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And of course, do support the other shows we have

890
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
vog network dot com.

891
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I do not, and this is going to be news to you guys,

892
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
so sorry to spring this on you mid-show.

893
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We will not be here in two weeks,

894
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
because I'm going to be at that convention in San Francisco.

895
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I won't be back in time.

896
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So, because Sunday's the last day.

897
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So, sorry.

898
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Okay.

899
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Sorry about it.

900
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
No show in two weeks.

901
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Surprise.

902
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Well, maybe, I don't, I don't,

903
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
keep that flexible, because maybe I'll be back early enough,

904
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
or we can do something a little later or something,

905
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
but I just, yeah.

906
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I totally want to take over the stream and do a fuck-off show.

907
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah, do whatever you want.

908
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's called Jamie Rants.

909
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Or do a live stream.

910
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Loki can play Borderlands whenever, so.

911
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm not playing Borderlands.

912
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm hoping I can do some fun stuff at the convention,

913
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and I'm going to be seeing a lot of my podcast pals from like,

914
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
well, we're all doing that panel, which I should obviously be plugging, duh.

915
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Saturday night, and I believe six o'clock, is Podcast Cross Zone.

916
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's OLR, me.

917
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's Koopa Club, our friends from Chicago,

918
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and I believe Long Beach is where one of their hosts lives.

919
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Game Buoy, Game Bar, and more.

920
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Special surprise guest, hopefully, all talking about podcasting,

921
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and kind of our own shows,

922
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and trying to enable other people to do their own shows,

923
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and enable more broadcasters.

924
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It is a GLBT-focused convention, obviously,

925
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
but we're really about everybody, you know, having a voice.

926
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Good times.

927
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Alright, let's get into some news.

928
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Loki.

929
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yes, Pokemon Rumble.

930
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm actually kind of surprised that this is coming out still digitally,

931
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
but Pokemon Rumble was a game that came out in Japan,

932
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think earlier last year, maybe this year.

933
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It was a digital download for the Wii U,

934
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
and what makes it kind of unique is it was sort of going the Skylanders route,

935
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
where you have these physical figurines that you buy for a certain amount of money,

936
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and you, I think you put them on the, I don't know if it's,

937
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I want to say it was the Near Field Communication part of the Wii U tablet,

938
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
or the game pad, or whatever, and it interacted with that.

939
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So, it is coming out over here in North America, August 29th.

940
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
18 figurines.

941
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
However, they are sold exclusively at Evil-G,

942
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:13,000
so if you watch your Pokemon, you know, Nintendo has still made this blood pack with Evil-G to do that.

943
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
The game, I guess, is 18 bucks in the eShop.

944
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Each figurine is going to be $4.

945
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I don't know.

946
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Neat.

947
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I, uh, why not?

948
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Except for the fact that it's a GameStop exclusive, but something to hold us over until X and Y, right?

949
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Europe is also going to be getting the game August 15th.

950
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No words on how they're going to, if that's going to be done through GameStop in Europe as well.

951
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't know.

952
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
But, it's kind of lame.

953
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I don't know.

954
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I just don't understand why they're making, I mean, I understand they're a big company,

955
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
but why exclusive through GameStop to do this stuff?

956
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I don't know why they would do that.

957
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I mean, because honestly, I think everybody could sell those stupid figurines.

958
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Hell, they put it on the game as, like, a disc.

959
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm surprised they didn't do that in the first place.

960
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
$20 game, you know?

961
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah, especially because Nintendo puts a lot of stuff on disc.

962
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Yeah, put it in a $20 game, maybe bundle it with a figurine or something like that, and there you go.

963
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Super Luigi U is on disc, right?

964
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
It will be.

965
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Anyway.

966
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Alright, well, more Nintendo news.

967
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I mentioned this, obviously, during my gaming week, but I want to officially acknowledge

968
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
EarthBound is finally out on the Virtual Console.

969
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's only available on Wii U, however, so you can't get it on 3DS, you can't get it on the Wii,

970
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
which sadly makes sense because Nintendo's trying to push people to the Wii U,

971
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and there are people crazy enough to buy a Wii U to play EarthBound.

972
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But you can play it at my house.

973
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Especially considering how much those cartridges go for on eBay, you know?

974
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah, I won't tell you how cheap we got ours.

975
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Well, you might have got lucky, too. Did you find it at a...

976
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It was a long time ago.

977
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah, before the value...

978
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Probably when we had the video game store.

979
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So, anyway, this is out.

980
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
There was a special Nintendo Direct to go with it.

981
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Some people taking surprise at the increased price because the game is $9.99 on the Wii U eShop.

982
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It is not the normal, I'm using my quotey fingers, price of $7.99.

983
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
But to be honest, this isn't the first time we've seen a game priced higher than the bar.

984
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I believe Mario 2 loss levels, or what they...

985
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Super Mario 2, the Japanese version, was a dollar more than most NES games.

986
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Because on the Wii, they did this whole week of import releases.

987
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And, you know, Mario 2 is the big flagship of those, the original one.

988
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And that was a dollar more.

989
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
The Final Fantasy games, I think, at least the Super Nintendo ones that they put out on Virtual Console,

990
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
those were a dollar, or maybe even two dollars more. I think they were a dollar more.

991
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Squeenix tax.

992
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah, basically. Well, now this is, you know, Nintendo tax.

993
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Both.

994
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Well, so why are they charging the increased price? Because they can, honestly.

995
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I mean...

996
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Gotta make up that game some exclusive money somewhere.

997
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I guess so. I mean, it's not like $9.99 is a ripoff,

998
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
but they are talking about that there's an enhanced value about the Earthbound Strategy Guide,

999
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
which is out there, and it's enhanced for the Wii U gamepad,

1000
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and you can actually view it on Nintendo's Earthbound site.

1001
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Which, you know, you press the little home button, go into the browser, and you can open up on the site.

1002
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm gonna be honest. I find that feature, and I'm using my quotey fingers,

1003
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I find that feature to be a little bit disingenuous.

1004
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I don't think that's really a feature, because you're just advertising a website, basically.

1005
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And to be honest, I could open up my internet browser and go to gamefacts.com

1006
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and pull up almost anything that's on Virtual Console.

1007
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I mean, I can do that.

1008
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That's cool that Nintendo did the optimized and scanned it in and made that or whatever,

1009
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
but you technically don't have to own Earthbound to see that.

1010
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You know what I mean? That's not really value for buying the game.

1011
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So if you're gonna tell me that the $2 was for that, I'm gonna tell you that's a crock of shit.

1012
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Because that would be like me saying,

1013
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Oh, well, with every copy of Donkey Kong sold on the Virtual Console, you get a free voggenetwork.com.

1014
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Check it out.

1015
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It doesn't quite work for me.

1016
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I mean, cool. It would be neat if Nintendo would do more manuals and stuff,

1017
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
but you know what would be even better is if instead of having to press the home button,

1018
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
having to press the internet browser button, having to enter in earthbound.nintendo.com,

1019
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
having to wait for the thing to load. You know what would be even better than that?

1020
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Just tapping the screen and having an extra button that says guide and then it just comes right up.

1021
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's already downloaded to your Wii U. It's just right there. Instant.

1022
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
No, it's even better.

1023
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
That would again require Nintendo to get online and speed some things up a little bit.

1024
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I guess this is a baby step.

1025
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Did you know with your copy of Balloon Fight that you can actually get a free copy of Pornhub?

1026
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Free porn. With a Nintendo title. I mean, that's ridiculous.

1027
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But it's optimized.

1028
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Shadownextgen in chat at live.voggenetwork.com says,

1029
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The guide from Nintendo would most likely be better than what you will find on Game Facts.

1030
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
No.

1031
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Graphically, yes. For the retro-minded in you, yes.

1032
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You know, again, for the whole tickling your retro tastes or whatever, yes.

1033
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But Game Facts will honestly be faster. That site was slow as hell when I was playing with it.

1034
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It's probably outsourced anyway, so it's probably going to be a Prima guide or something.

1035
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
But...

1036
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
No, no. Well, I mean, this was years ago, but every copy of Earthbound, when you bought it, it came in that bigger box.

1037
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I believe, I could be wrong, I believe it was a whole thing tied in to push Nintendo Power subscriptions.

1038
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Because, remember how Nintendo Power would do those guides?

1039
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
If there was one for Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, I could be wrong.

1040
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Mario Paint.

1041
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But I thought Earthbound was technically one of those guides.

1042
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And that there were things in there to try to get you to get a Nintendo Power subscription.

1043
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I had the Mario Paint one, that was freaking sweet.

1044
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I'm having to think back almost 20 years here, but...

1045
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Anyhow.

1046
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yeah, all sorts of pixel art in there for doing animated Yoshis and all sorts of fun stuff.

1047
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
AlphaKnanogram says, the online US guide sucks, the Nintendo Europe site has the PDF to download.

1048
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And you put it on your iPad.

1049
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
That's honestly how I've been doing a lot of playthroughs.

1050
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Not just Nintendo, but even 360 and Playstation 3 as well.

1051
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I pull up the thing on my iPad.

1052
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Works great.

1053
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And BlackWolf says, it was a Nintendo guide, not a Prima guide.

1054
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Could have still been outsourced though.

1055
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It didn't necessarily have to come in internally from Nintendo.

1056
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But they had the hotline, didn't they?

1057
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Oh, they still did at that time, yeah.

1058
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Oh yeah, the game counselors, absolutely.

1059
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,000
To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, thunder.

1060
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Moving on, DarkSakura.

1061
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yes, we do have some other news.

1062
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I'm sorry, I've been discussing certain old Exedy games with somebody.

1063
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Exedy games? That's really old.

1064
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Like Gorf? Wasn't Gorf an Exedy game?

1065
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Well, I'll go ahead and say it, but I won't say who I've been talking with or the reason why.

1066
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

1067
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Venture.

1068
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, yeah, you brought that up on the show before.

1069
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I think I've done Venture as a classic. If I haven't, I should.

1070
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I think you have.

1071
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Anyway, speaking of classic games, everybody has been messaging me this to show Dan, and Dan knows. Trust me.

1072
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Of course Dan knows.

1073
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Of course Dan knows.

1074
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's nice that people think of you, though.

1075
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Thank you, everybody. But keep in mind, Dan used to run a site called Neo Strider's Strider Zone.

1076
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And it was one of two Strider sites that existed back in the days when people had websites on AOL.

1077
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
He was probably sitting there, all of a sudden the hair on his arm went up. He's like, Strider news has been announced.

1078
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:25,000
He turned red in the face, and like all of a sudden weird signals came from his head where he started accepting the vibe of Strider.

1079
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Did he cry?

1080
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
As it flowed.

1081
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Did he cry? Was there a little shaking?

1082
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think he peed a little.

1083
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Which I'm glad that he's not listening right now, so I love you, Dan.

1084
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
What other embarrassing Dan stories do you want to tell?

1085
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Love you, mean it.

1086
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I did say that I was going to clone his liver and sell multiple copies on eBay.

1087
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Because livers are worth the money, man.

1088
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I told him if he ever pissed me off, I'd punch him until he peed blood.

1089
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You make that threat of a lot of people, though.

1090
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I do.

1091
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You can't just throw that around willy-nilly.

1092
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I only do that to people I care about. Rob, by the way.

1093
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Hey.

1094
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Anyway, so yeah, I mentioned Strider. It is Strider.

1095
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,000
There is a version of Strider which is supposed to be a series reboot, from what I understand, like a redoing of the first game.

1096
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
From what we could see of the trailer, it looked like the whole first level.

1097
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And it's being done by Double Helix, who is also working on Killer Instinct, so I don't know.

1098
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
This looks like it would be a lot better than that Killer Instinct thing, so I have some high hopes.

1099
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Watching the gameplay, it was really, really cool.

1100
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
He doesn't so much walk as Dash everywhere he goes. He runs with purpose.

1101
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Keep in mind, I loved Strider 2. I loved the updated thing.

1102
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I loved every appearance of Strider Hear You in Marvel vs. Capcom.

1103
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
The various Marvel vs. Capcom's when he was playable.

1104
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And one of my favorite characters of all time, thanks to Dan, making me sit down and said,

1105
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Any person I marry is going to beat Strider.

1106
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
On Genesis.

1107
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Which I have.

1108
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And finally beaten on arcade and beaten PlayStation version, blah, blah, blah.

1109
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And that last fight with the stupid master is bitch.

1110
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It's a pain in the ass.

1111
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,000
But anyway, so yeah, we both have a lot of happy going on in our house because of Strider.

1112
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Do you even love Strider on the NES?

1113
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm going to tell you about Strider on the NES.

1114
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It's based off the manga.

1115
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So it is not the arcade game.

1116
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It's got this one jump that's like freaking impossible.

1117
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I think we own the game and I think Dan kind of likes it.

1118
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
The infamous triangle jump.

1119
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
The triangle jump, yes.

1120
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I do like the story in the game. I've read the manga.

1121
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I don't like playing it.

1122
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So I would much rather play the original Strider any day.

1123
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I loved Strider on the NES.

1124
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Because I didn't have a Genesis.

1125
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
We weren't really a Sega household.

1126
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
We were all Nintendo.

1127
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So I played Strider on the NES.

1128
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I really liked it.

1129
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And hearing that this new game is kind of Metroidvania-ish made me think of the NES version.

1130
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Not that the NES was really Metroidvania, but it had like the different stages.

1131
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
The Nintendo Strider, I'm almost positive, was the same engine that DuckTales used.

1132
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Because they were very similar where you would select a stage.

1133
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Like you would go to the various areas.

1134
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And then, you know, you clear that.

1135
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Well, and other games use that same formula too.

1136
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But my big thing is that I just didn't enjoy playing it as much as I did the original.

1137
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And keep in mind, I didn't grow up with a Genesis.

1138
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I played Strider in the arcade a couple of times.

1139
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And it wasn't really my thing.

1140
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And I didn't play it on Nintendo.

1141
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
But like I said, Dan sat me down and said,

1142
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Any woman I marry is going to play Strider.

1143
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So I've beaten Ghosts N Goblins 2, which made me want to cry tears of blood.

1144
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But Strider, at least, is a fun game.

1145
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And, you know, he actually told me a little bit of trivia about that too.

1146
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Is that it was going to be a regular cartridge.

1147
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
But because they wanted to put the Amazon level in it,

1148
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
They actually upped the memory in it.

1149
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So they could include the Amazon level and have the music and everything.

1150
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Nice.

1151
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah. So.

1152
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So this news fills a certain hole in your heart that not even Moon Diver could fill, right?

1153
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Moon Diver was a good game.

1154
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I mean, it's a spiritual successor in the series.

1155
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But we need to have Strider.

1156
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
No one.

1157
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And what I'm kind of hoping is that with this we get some of the elements from Strider 2.

1158
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Like we see Hien.

1159
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You know, because I actually really like to play through the game with Hien.

1160
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That was really fun.

1161
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
The guy who had two cyphers.

1162
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It was really cool.

1163
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
But I have high hopes for this.

1164
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It looks pretty. It looks like it plays solidly.

1165
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
The backgrounds were amazing. The music was amazing.

1166
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And it was the same first level that I heard.

1167
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So I will keep my fingers crossed.

1168
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
A lot of people have been frowning a little bit hearing who's developing this.

1169
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Because, you know, the new Killer Instinct game.

1170
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Which I don't know. I mean, it's hard to judge a game that's not even out.

1171
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I don't know.

1172
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But Silent Hill Homecoming has a lot of people kind of nervous.

1173
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But, you know, I don't know if it's...

1174
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
We really have to wait until the game's out.

1175
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I mean, WayForward does a lot of great retro updates now.

1176
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Dude, they made Ping Pals if I remember right.

1177
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So that game was literally the worst handheld game in history.

1178
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So if, you know, that company can do better after their first couple attempts.

1179
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm willing to give these guys a chance.

1180
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And, like I said, I looked at the trailer and it really would be hard to screw up Strider.

1181
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Unless there were major timing and physics issues.

1182
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Other than that, it really looked very solid.

1183
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And all they have to do is take the timing physics from the original.

1184
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And they would know exactly how to do it.

1185
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And, you know, like I said, I've played other versions of Strider.

1186
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We actually have the PC Engine version.

1187
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Which we can't play because we don't have the card for it.

1188
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
The arcade card.

1189
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
But that one even...

1190
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I don't think it would be too hard. I really don't think it would be too hard.

1191
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
They'd have to really screw up, like I said, timing and physics to ruin the game.

1192
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Or, you know, maybe really shitty voice acting.

1193
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Which, it can't get...

1194
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Even the first game actually had pretty...

1195
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
The original had pretty decent voice acting in it.

1196
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It was all in whatever the native language of whoever the character was.

1197
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But it has the best line in it.

1198
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I gotcha.

1199
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
The one guy.

1200
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And the new one's like, I'm Strider! I wanna hit you with my sword!

1201
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
They'd be like, Hi! I hear you!

1202
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Wow.

1203
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
They better give him the uber-bishy voice, you know?

1204
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I'm surprised they waited to announce this for Comic-Con.

1205
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
That they didn't bring this out at E3.

1206
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I mean, maybe it just wasn't ready, but...

1207
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
It's one of the games that the fans have been dying to get a new game of...

1208
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Sorry Mega Man! You guys fucking suck!

1209
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Hey! Enjoy the Game Boy games on 3DS!

1210
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
The Mega Man thing I think is fight now.

1211
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
But I'm actually a little bit more excited about Strider than I am about a Mega Man game, so...

1212
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I think a Mega Man project's in the works.

1213
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But I think with this Strider news and so forth, and Mega Man and Smash...

1214
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I think there'll be something next year.

1215
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
But, I mean, easy to say, right?

1216
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Any strange analyst can say that.

1217
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Alright, let's move on. Loki.

1218
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You'll be really awesome as if they do a new Mega Man game that's done by...

1219
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Was it WayForward, actually? I think.

1220
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
There were comments to that in the chatroom, too.

1221
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It'll suck, whatever it is, I'm sure. They can't do it.

1222
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
If the DuckTales thing goes well, you never know.

1223
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That looks cool.

1224
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Anyways, so NCAA. There was a bit of drama with that.

1225
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Considering that the game just came out, apparently NCAA is not renewing its contract with EA.

1226
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
This'll be, I guess, the last year that it'll be called NCAA Football 14.

1227
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
However, and I know they have a lawsuit against them.

1228
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And this is from 2008.

1229
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Basically saying that...

1230
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I want to say it was because they're using the...

1231
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,000
They've never licensed the use of current student athlete names, images, or likenesses.

1232
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I think the whole reason that they're not renewing their contract with them is they're trying to distance themselves from EA.

1233
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Because EA is kind of going around them and putting these students in the game.

1234
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And I guess EA is still going to be making college football games.

1235
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It'll just probably be called EA Sports College Football 15 next year or something like that.

1236
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And, of course, you know, they're just saying that, once again, even some attorneys that are dealing with the whole lawsuit are saying,

1237
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
yeah, it's basically...

1238
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:00,000
The announcement makes it plain that NCAA is attempting to mitigate the damages by ducking its responsibilities.

1239
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:13,000
They say that our suit illustrates the cabal between NCAA and EA has exploited student athletes for years using their images in video games without compensation.

1240
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Well, that sounds like EA.

1241
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:26,000
While we are heartened that they've stopped the practice, we believe that they owe students or student athletes a great deal more than implied promise to stop stealing their images.

1242
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So how's that going to work next year? Are they actually going to stop using the student images?

1243
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
So it's just going to be like generic people on a team type thing?

1244
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Are we going like EA Sports Tech Mobile here?

1245
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I mean, how's that going to work?

1246
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So I don't know.

1247
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Whatever.

1248
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And I even read in chat or something that they were saying that next year is going to be all next gen anyways.

1249
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
No current gen version of the game.

1250
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Could be a chance to kind of re reboot, reinvent things.

1251
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It's interesting to see if 2K comes back with a college football game.

1252
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Although the last one was that remember how they tried to do that whole American football or I forget what their one had like this weird like lineup of people in there and stuff and fake teams and stuff.

1253
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
And that didn't work out too well.

1254
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
But it'd be kind of neat to see 2K come back and do new.

1255
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
How important is it to have the actual people in the game?

1256
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I mean, I don't play a whole lot of sports games, but it's never really mattered to me.

1257
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah, the games I played games.

1258
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So, you know, you want to play as your favorite players and stuff.

1259
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And so which I really, I realized the NCAA games didn't actually have the player.

1260
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Well, I mean, they were all there except in name.

1261
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I mean, that's that's what it was, right?

1262
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Like their stats were what you would expect to see.

1263
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Their looks were what you would expect to see, you know, with subtle changes.

1264
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Just the names weren't there, you know?

1265
00:59:48,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Yeah, I think it's just they want, you know, they just like, you know, if you're playing an NBA game, you'd want to have, you know, they pay those players to use their likenesses and stuff in the game.

1266
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So the thing is, why aren't they paying these college students?

1267
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Because they think they can get away with it.

1268
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Oh, what's a college student going to do?

1269
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Try to sue me?

1270
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
You're broke.

1271
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I mean, seriously.

1272
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Well, they can't they can't profit.

1273
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It's NCAA regulations that they can't.

1274
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
NCAA is saying that they never license that stuff to them.

1275
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,000
They're basically saying, oh, well, we didn't do this, but they're still getting this stuff in the game anyway.

1276
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Well, Bobby and Chad wants to clarify.

1277
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Bobby Black Wolf says they only lost the NCAA name.

1278
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Nothing else.

1279
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The colleges and bowls and stadiums and stuff are still EA.

1280
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The only thing they lost is the NCAA name and the NCAA logo.

1281
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
That's it.

1282
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Well, then that won't affect anything.

1283
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
You don't think?

1284
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I don't think.

1285
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I don't think it'll be a big deal either.

1286
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I think at the end of the day, a good game is a good game.

1287
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Like I love Tecmo Bowl is like my favorite football game.

1288
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And it didn't really have any of that.

1289
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So, you know, anyhow.

1290
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Moving on.

1291
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Lots of gaming things being shown at Comic-Con.

1292
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Now, I know gaming kind of comes up every year at Comic-Con.

1293
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But it definitely seems like there's more of it this year than we usually see.

1294
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And that probably has something to do with the fact that we have new consoles coming this year.

1295
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So obviously the companies want to push that to the potential buying audience of which a lot of them are at Comic-Con right now.

1296
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Although I'm not there.

1297
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
But Sony is at Comic-Con with the PlayStation 4.

1298
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:26,000
They have NAC and Drive Club out there open for play, letting the public experience PlayStation 4.

1299
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I think it would be a safe bet to say those games will show up.

1300
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Everything you're hearing here, these games will get in a truck and move to PAX in a couple weeks.

1301
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Absolutely.

1302
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Octodad, excuse me, I guess is part of PlayStation 4 as well.

1303
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Gran Turismo 6 is also there even though technically that's not next gen.

1304
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It's still there.

1305
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It still looks nice.

1306
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Yeah.

1307
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Microsoft has Rise with the Y, Rise and Killer Instinct out there on the floor.

1308
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Killer Instinct drawing pretty good.

1309
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Apparently Rise is too.

1310
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Apparently other games being shown out there, Dead Rising 3, Assassin's Creed 4, and Watch Dogs.

1311
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
All there at Comic-Con.

1312
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
That's just a taste.

1313
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That's just some of the stuff that involves next gen and the big companies.

1314
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
So is there any comics to be found at Comic-Con out of curiosity?

1315
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Marvel's got a whole big thing.

1316
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
No, I know.

1317
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Well, you know, they actually did announce the next Avengers movie.

1318
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeah, but that's a movie.

1319
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's not a comic.

1320
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yeah, but it's still Marvel.

1321
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And why are they fucking going with Age of Ultron?

1322
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Sorry.

1323
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Not a fan?

1324
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm not a fan of Ultron.

1325
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
And they're doing the same thing in the comics.

1326
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
They tease Thanos.

1327
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So here I go talking about movies on the video game podcast.

1328
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Sorry.

1329
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I went to go see This is the End last night.

1330
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It was funny.

1331
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It was one of those movies that was so stupid.

1332
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's seriously stupid.

1333
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It was awesome.

1334
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
But to the point where it's actually really funny.

1335
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
It's so stupid you can't help but laugh.

1336
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Like a lot of stoner comedies are.

1337
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It was great.

1338
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yeah, I had a good time. It was good.

1339
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
But I got home.

1340
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
In the first news that greets me when I yell,

1341
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
the Superman sequel will have Batman in it.

1342
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
They're doing the Superman vs. Batman thing that was in one of the comics.

1343
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I'm just like,

1344
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
stop.

1345
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Stop.

1346
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And I know this is a whole

1347
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
to build up to the Justice League movie

1348
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
that they have to do.

1349
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Because Marvel's got the Avengers.

1350
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
So now DC's got to do this.

1351
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
But it's like, no.

1352
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
No. You do not get to do

1353
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
a Justice League movie

1354
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
until you fucking do a Wonder Woman movie.

1355
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You don't get to debut her.

1356
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
No. She needs her own movie.

1357
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And it needs to be good. Because if it sucks,

1358
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
you don't get to do a Justice League movie.

1359
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And I don't.

1360
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
God, the whole idea of Batman and Superman is just.

1361
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I don't. I don't like that.

1362
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I don't know. Like, I get that it's based on a comic

1363
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
and it was a real thing and everything, but I don't know.

1364
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Maybe there's just that part of me that holds out hope

1365
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
for a fourth Bale Batman movie,

1366
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
which I realize they probably couldn't

1367
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
do because of the story and everything, but

1368
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
dammit, there's always a way.

1369
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
There's always a way. I want to see a

1370
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
sequel to Suburban Commando, but instead

1371
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
of having Hulk Hogan in the movie, it'll be

1372
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Christian Bale Batman, and he'll be like

1373
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
going around the neighborhood driving a car.

1374
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Just a regular car. Not the Batmobile. Just like

1375
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
calling the people. You know, that'd be fun.

1376
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Maybe babysitting some

1377
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
kids.

1378
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
There's

1379
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
some Marvel versus DC chat

1380
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
going on in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

1381
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And all the Marvel people are right.

1382
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Brad from Pod Culture says,

1383
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
you should ask if any good comics are there. Who reads

1384
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Marvel? People with taste.

1385
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Snap.

1386
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Slidekick says, I've always preferred Marvel

1387
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
for superheroes. People, please.

1388
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
There's good and bad on

1389
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
both sides. There's good and bad on

1390
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
both sides. Yes, check out Rocket Raccoon.

1391
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's all about image, anyways.

1392
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I will say,

1393
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I don't watch a lot of

1394
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
TV, although

1395
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I have been watching Orange is the New Black based on

1396
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Recommendation, that Netflix show, but

1397
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I'm stupid looking forward to

1398
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. TV show.

1399
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Yeah, me too. I think it's kind of rad that

1400
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
they're doing this big budget TV show.

1401
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I'm still super pissed off that there is

1402
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
still not AKA Jessica Jones.

1403
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
You heard at Comic-Con,

1404
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I don't know, I guess there was

1405
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
a panel or something with David Covington

1406
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and the whole X-Files crew and stuff, but he wants to

1407
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
bring that back. I'm like, yes.

1408
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Please. That would be fantastic.

1409
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I still haven't seen the second movie, which I hear

1410
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
is really dumb, but

1411
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I would love to have them just

1412
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
bring it back. I mean, they're both not really fucking

1413
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
doing anything. I mean, just bring back

1414
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
a whole new series and just set it

1415
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
20 years later and

1416
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
pick it up from where it, you know,

1417
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
where it left off. That'd be fantastic.

1418
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Alright.

1419
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Let's move on with more news.

1420
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Classic game of the week,

1421
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
still a little bit away, and release date's coming up

1422
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
right after this. TarSaga.

1423
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Ready to friend some butt?

1424
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
What? I explained that to Dan, by the way.

1425
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
He's like, you guys are weird.

1426
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So Nintendo has trademarked

1427
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
two game names that

1428
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
will really do hint to

1429
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Seaman.

1430
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
They have

1431
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
the rights to Mysterious Pet

1432
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Legend of the Fish with a Human Face

1433
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
and Mysterious Partner

1434
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Legend of the Fish with a Human Face.

1435
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And it was

1436
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
registered in

1437
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Japan. It was

1438
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
now, there have been

1439
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
some goings

1440
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
on with the creator of

1441
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Seaman, who is Yut Saito,

1442
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
who did work with

1443
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Nintendo

1444
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
for GameCube content. That was a

1445
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
pinball game,

1446
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Odama, and

1447
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
the Guild 101

1448
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
thing,

1449
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Air Reporter. So

1450
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
it could be possible that we may be seeing

1451
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
another Seaman. They'd have to put out

1452
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
a micro, well, I guess the microphone's already built into the

1453
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
controller, so who knows?

1454
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
On both the 3DS and

1455
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
on the, well,

1456
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
3DSDS and

1457
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Wii U.

1458
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I will not friend his butt, and actually it doesn't sound

1459
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
very exciting, but

1460
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
sure, why not?

1461
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I think that butt friending should be

1462
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
a thing.

1463
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Click to butt friend. I think there's a lot

1464
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
of people that don't get that joke, and I'm trying

1465
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
to find that original YouTube.

1466
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Yeah, that was a while back.

1467
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Was it a Let's Play? That was a long time ago.

1468
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Some dude doing a Let's Play with that

1469
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
game, Seaman. Yeah.

1470
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I think it was, like,

1471
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Seaman gameplay, or, yeah, Let's

1472
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Play.

1473
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I'm assuming Tigerclaw could probably find

1474
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
it, because he could find it. Yeah, Tigerclaw, do your job.

1475
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Find us the link.

1476
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Hopefully. Friend his butt for us.

1477
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Let me Tigerclaw that for you.

1478
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It was, like, asking

1479
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
about birthdays, and it was like,

1480
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
are we friends?

1481
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I'll friend your butt.

1482
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Wait, wait.

1483
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I might have found it.

1484
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I might have beat Tigerclaw out of this.

1485
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That's it.

1486
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Okay, wait.

1487
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Let me give credit where credit is due.

1488
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh, gotta love this

1489
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
username. Ebola World

1490
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
is the user that did this.

1491
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
You just need to click like.

1492
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So, what

1493
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
month is your birthday in?

1494
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
October.

1495
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You were born in October?

1496
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
No, it doesn't.

1497
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Let's try that again.

1498
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
In what month

1499
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
were you

1500
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
born?

1501
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
October.

1502
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You were born in October?

1503
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yes.

1504
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I wonder if people would say you're a

1505
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
trick, or a treat?

1506
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Treat.

1507
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Like

1508
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
the spice?

1509
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yes.

1510
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Well, you can

1511
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
look, but don't touch.

1512
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I don't want to touch

1513
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
you.

1514
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
What

1515
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
do you want?

1516
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
To touch you.

1517
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I don't know that word.

1518
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
You just said it.

1519
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
So, what day is your

1520
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
birthday on?

1521
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
The second.

1522
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
The second?

1523
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Yes, bitch.

1524
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Mahatma Gandhi was also

1525
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
born on October 2nd.

1526
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
This honestly sounds like me talking to

1527
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Siri.

1528
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I hope you are as peaceful as he.

1529
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I would loathe

1530
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
to be stuck in here with

1531
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
an aggressive human being.

1532
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Fuck you.

1533
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Listen, I

1534
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
don't know if our relationship

1535
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
can handle

1536
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
this, you know?

1537
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Besides, what would the neighbors think?

1538
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Fuck them.

1539
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Fuck them.

1540
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Hey, why all the noise?

1541
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Your mama.

1542
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
What?

1543
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Your mama.

1544
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Mama?

1545
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Nope,

1546
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I'm just fine.

1547
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Wait.

1548
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Sorry, I'm busy.

1549
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
You don't look busy.

1550
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I'll friend your butt.

1551
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Are you coming

1552
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
on to me?

1553
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
There, there it is.

1554
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Two minutes

1555
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and thirty seconds later. Again, credit to

1556
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
YouTube user EbolaWorld for that.

1557
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Totally just stole that there. But that's where that

1558
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
joke comes from, the whole I'll friend your butt thing, which

1559
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
is great. So, lots of

1560
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
let's plays, I'm sure, coming.

1561
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
If this happens to be true, which I kind of

1562
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
hope it is, that would be great.

1563
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
You know, we actually did

1564
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
play the game to completion

1565
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
and set our little frogman free.

1566
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And then Dan's like,

1567
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I wonder if he's still there.

1568
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Well, our

1569
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
we still have our save files intact.

1570
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
So. Nice.

1571
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check

1572
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
out some release dates of some games coming

1573
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
out a lot sooner than any

1574
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
C-Man reboot.

1575
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You know, we could

1576
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
definitely use a C-Man

1577
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
reboot this week because all we have is

1578
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
the Smurfs 2.

1579
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
The official game.

1580
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Let's check Boogaloo.

1581
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

1582
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.

1583
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You said Wii-Wii.

1584
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I said Wii-Wii U.

1585
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Alright, then I guess we travel to Japan.

1586
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
That was quick. Looking at some of the

1587
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
release dates in Japan. On the PlayStation 3

1588
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
this week, quite a bit actually,

1589
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Dragon's Crown, Ketsuie,

1590
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Kizuna, Jigoko Tachi Extra

01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
in regular and limited edition.

1592
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Majo Tohai Kihei comes out

1593
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
as well in regular and limited.

1594
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Also, Race Driver Grid 2 and

1595
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
X-Blade Code Embryo.

1596
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And, Zone of the Enders HD

1597
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
edition gets a price reduction this week.

1598
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
So. Lots and lots

1599
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
of releases there.

1600
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Also, going to

1601
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
on the Xbox 360

1602
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I don't think there's

1603
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
really anything

1604
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
on the 360. I mean, what did you expect?

1605
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Haha. Also, looking at

1606
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
the PlayStation Vita.

1607
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Let's see. Dragon's Crown

1608
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
as well as

1609
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
X-Blaze Code Embryo.

1610
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Next Rev Aiken

1611
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
and Dragon's Crown Famitsu

1612
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
pack. Like a Famitsu edition

1613
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
on the PlayStation Vita this week.

1614
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
And,

1615
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
looking at the, let's see

1616
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
on the Wii U. The Wii U does

1617
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
have Lego City Undercover, getting its Japanese

1618
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
release this week. And, also

1619
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
a new GamePad battery pack

1620
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
which I think was reported on a couple weeks ago. That is

1621
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
actually getting its release in Japan this week

1622
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
as far as peripherals go.

1623
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Going to the 3DS.

1624
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Gaikuten Saiban

1625
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
5 is finally released

1626
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
from Capcom. And, that

1627
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
is the Phoenix Wright game, basically.

1628
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
That's the one with Apollo and all the

1629
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
folks in it. Is that the one that's rated

1630
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
M, I think I heard?

1631
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I don't think so.

1632
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
For its release over here.

1633
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Well, anyway, that is out

1634
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
in Japan this week and there's a whole lot of peripherals

1635
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
to come with that. Fantasy Life

1636
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Link and Chibi Devil 2

1637
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Mahou no Yume Ihon.

1638
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
To.

1639
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Is that? No.

1640
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
No, not To.

1641
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Beast Saga Saikyuu

1642
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Gekutosu Coliseum

1643
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
comes out on the 3DS this week.

1644
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's a busy week in Japan. That's interesting.

1645
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Why? Hmm. Now, I've seen

1646
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
that before somewhere, but I don't know.

1647
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And lastly, yes, there are still

1648
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
PCP, or, PCP,

1649
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
PSP games coming.

1650
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Daya no Kuni no Alice

1651
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Wonderful Mirror World. I wonder if that's

1652
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
based off Alice in Wonderland type of game.

1653
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I'm sure it is. Or, Through the Looking Glass.

1654
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Like an anime to, oh yeah, see, look.

1655
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
The Mad Hatter is a

1656
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
sexy thing. That's the March Hare.

1657
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Well, the Mad Hatter is right behind him.

1658
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
They're all sexy.

1659
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Like, you know,

1660
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
anime style. And, Toki no

1661
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Keizuna Hanomisubi

1662
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Tezuri comes out in regular and

1663
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
limited edition. And there's a twin pack as well.

1664
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Lots of games.

1665
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Not so many for the UK.

1666
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
On the 22nd, we have RuneScape 3

1667
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
for PC. On the 25th,

1668
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I have no idea how this

1669
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
is supposed to say.

1670
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Rimmed Capsule. Is that it?

1671
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Rimmed Capsule on iPad, Android, and iPhone.

1672
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Shadowrun Returns for iPad,

1673
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Android, Mac, and PC.

1674
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And on the 26th, we have Pikmin 3 for Wii U.

1675
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It's over.

1676
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Nothing else.

1677
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys

1678
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
than the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.

1679
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Okay, this is kind of ridiculous.

1680
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
You know,

1681
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
a lot of people

1682
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
would say that the Xbox One

1683
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
might be a little rushed, or even some of these

1684
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
next gen systems. But,

1685
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
there was some

1686
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
news that came out

1687
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
regarding Forza Motorsport 5.

1688
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Saying that the game was

1689
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
going to require a one-time

1690
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
download before it can be played.

1691
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And that they were basically

1692
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
um, it's such

1693
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
a crunch for

1694
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
you know, time, that

1695
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
they were putting the base,

1696
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
you know, kind of the framework of the game together,

1697
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
they're getting that press to disk, and then

1698
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
they were going to be working

1699
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
on the tracks

1700
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
up until launch.

1701
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And so basically, you would

1702
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
have to buy the game,

1703
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
and then you'd have to download the rest

1704
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
um, you know,

1705
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
when you first put the game in the system.

1706
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
So you would need to be connected to the internet.

1707
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Now,

1708
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
of course, there's been some back and forth

1709
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
about it. They said, you know, I guess

1710
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Turn 10's Dan Greenwald,

1711
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
he changed his statement

1712
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
saying that

1713
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
the requirement

1714
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
of a connection to Xbox Live before

1715
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
playing is not the plan.

1716
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
However, when or if the game requires

1717
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
an internet connection for

1718
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
single player content, it's still not clear.

1719
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So...

1720
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I don't know. Is that how they were gonna

1721
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I mean, that is getting ridiculous.

1722
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You know, now where these games ship

1723
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
and there's not a whole ton of testing, and then they have

1724
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
this day one patch or whatever that fixes some

1725
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
bugs, which is fine. I understand that

1726
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I appreciate there is bug fixing being

1727
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
done between, you know, mastering the disk

1728
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
and actually launching it and stuff, but

1729
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
when you get to the point where the game is

1730
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
literally not done, it is

1731
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
admitted to be

1732
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
it is not done. The game is

1733
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
not done, and now

1734
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
they need to put it on

1735
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
disk so that, you know,

1736
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
you download the rest of the content later because

1737
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
they want to hit that launch

1738
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
window or whatever.

1739
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
That's ridiculous. That is

1740
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
absolutely ridiculous, and I'm sorry.

1741
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I just...

1742
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Is this why they wanted this whole digital

1743
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
system in the first place, is so that

1744
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
they could literally, you know,

1745
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
ship unfinished products, but hey, whatever

1746
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
you just download the rest later.

1747
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Is that how it's supposed to work?

1748
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Because what if you don't have an internet connection?

1749
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
The game is fucking useless. Are they gonna advertise

1750
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
this on the box that the game is gonna require

1751
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
a, you know,

1752
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
a connection to download the thing?

1753
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
What's the point? I just don't understand.

1754
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
That really sucks

1755
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
for those people that don't

1756
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
have the internet connection, which was a big

1757
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
part of the push to get Xbox One

1758
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
to reverse their policies to begin with. And it's not even

1759
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
the internet connection thing. Let's just skip

1760
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
the whole, like, people that don't have internet,

1761
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
okay? Because a lot of people do have internet.

1762
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It's still gonna take

1763
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
a long time to download the rest of the content

1764
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
for that game. I mean,

1765
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
you know DLC and stuff that includes

1766
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
like actual new art assets

1767
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and stuff, or at least a few hundred

1768
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
meg. And when you're talking that, you

1769
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
know, let's just assume that

1770
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
the majority of the tracks aren't on the game.

1771
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
You're talking like a multi-gig

1772
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
download that even on

1773
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
a somewhat decent

1774
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
you know,

1775
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
somewhat decent

1776
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I guess bandwidth or whatever. That's gonna

1777
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
take at least an hour

1778
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
to download. Are you gonna really wanna have

1779
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
to deal with that bullshit?

1780
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
You know, that you have to download a big portion

1781
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
of the game in the first place to

1782
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
be able to even play the single player campaign?

1783
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I think that's just kind of ridiculous.

1784
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
What if we even would do that?

1785
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I don't know.

1786
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And is this something that says,

1787
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
okay, yeah, we're gonna have

1788
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
you know, this extra

1789
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
content that we're building up to launch.

1790
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Does that mean that later on, after it

1791
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
launches, that they're gonna put all that content

1792
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
onto the disc later on?

1793
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Are they gonna do that, or are they just gonna

1794
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
say, eh, fuck it, or whatever?

1795
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I think this is

1796
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
too much of the letting the

1797
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
day one patch fix your problems.

1798
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Dude, if this game isn't ready at launch,

1799
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
then don't launch it with it.

1800
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Launch it a couple weeks later. It's fine.

1801
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Because you're already gonna have games coming out,

1802
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
so what if it doesn't come out day one?

1803
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
That's okay. It's sometimes good to have things

1804
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
a little later, too. I mean, like, you know, Infamous

1805
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
is- The Wii U could've used that.

1806
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah, Infamous isn't coming out day one and stuff,

1807
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
and I just don't understand

1808
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
why they wouldn't push it.

1809
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I wanna say that a lot

1810
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
of release dates for games

1811
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
have to do with money and advertising.

1812
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
With advertising,

1813
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
with deals

1814
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
with distributors. I really

1815
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
think that that's where a lot of it comes into. So they set

1816
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
this date that may or may

1817
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
not be realistic,

1818
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
and don't want to violate that date,

1819
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
so they go ahead and ship and keep

1820
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
working on it so that they have the patches ready.

1821
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
That's my thought on why they do that, but

1822
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I still- I would personally prefer

1823
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
them to wait. They can ship the data,

1824
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
but I understand, yeah, that people plan

1825
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
ahead for advertising, but

1826
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
it's- they're planning holiday

1827
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
advertisements and stuff.

1828
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
It's a little closer than now.

1829
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I mean, now is-

1830
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
you know, that's quite a ways

1831
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
away from launch. You know, whereas

1832
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
holiday advertisements and stuff, they probably want to

1833
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
nail that down maybe by September

1834
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
or something. You know, a couple months out.

1835
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I just think that, you know,

1836
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
it's not gonna be ready, and they know it

1837
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
now. They know right now their plan

1838
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
is not gonna ship the game complete.

1839
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That's a big problem

1840
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
if you know that you're not gonna hit your launch

1841
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
and you're already, you know, how many months out?

1842
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Just push it. Just push the game

1843
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
if it's not gonna be ready. Now, the question is

1844
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
are other games gonna be like this?

1845
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Are we gonna see the same thing with Rise

1846
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
because they've rushed the launch

1847
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
for this system.

1848
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Has Rise been worked on for quite some time now?

1849
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
It doesn't matter. I don't care. I mean,

1850
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
there's been games that have shipped

1851
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
incomplete, you know, before,

1852
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
so I'm just not-

1853
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I don't know. It's

1854
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
disheartening, I guess.

1855
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
But, you know, whatever, they're not gonna tell anybody

1856
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
about it, so. Well,

1857
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I guess they did. That's kind of weird. They probably

1858
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
won't tell the general public about it.

1859
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It won't be on the, you know, box saying

1860
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
hey, you need to connect to the internet to play this.

1861
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
It's all incentives. Alright. Well, here's

1862
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
a game I'm sure they will have no problem delaying

1863
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
until it's damn near perfect, although

1864
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I mean, sometimes this game gets bugs too.

1865
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
There was a pretty infamous one

1866
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
on the Wii release of Zelda.

1867
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And, come on, we all

1868
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
know that there's gonna be a Wii U game

1869
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
or a Zelda game on the Wii U.

1870
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
We all know that's something that's gotta happen.

1871
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Maybe something revealed next year. Who knows.

1872
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And, Satoru Iwata

1873
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
has come out saying, you know, we hope to reveal

1874
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
this game in the not-too-distant

1875
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
future. Quote,

1876
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It is true that Mr. Anuma's

1877
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
see, I can never say this guy's name. Sorry.

1878
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Anuma's team has been working on a new

1879
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Zelda title for Wii U, but the only

1880
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
announcement we have at the time of software that will

1881
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
soon become available is Wind Waker HD.

1882
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
But, they are actually working on an

1883
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
exclusive new Wii U title in the Zelda franchise

1884
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and I hope in the not-too-distant future

1885
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
we will be able to make the relevant announcement.

1886
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
So, it's like, yes,

1887
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
it's coming, but,

1888
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
no. Yes, it's coming.

1889
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And, the demo is on the Wind Waker

1890
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
HD disc. That would be

1891
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
awesome, but, probably not happening.

1892
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
But, anyway, what I really wanted to talk

1893
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
about was an interview with

1894
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Anuma

1895
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
who was talking about

1896
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
the tired formula

1897
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
of traditional Zelda games.

1898
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I might be kind of

1899
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
embellishing that a little bit, but

1900
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
here it is. Here's the quote in what he said

1901
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
in an interview with LA Times. Quote,

1902
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
It's not that anyone is telling me we have to

1903
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
change the formula. I want to change it.

1904
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I'm kind of getting tired of it.

1905
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
If I'm getting tired of it, then I'm sure other people are

1906
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
getting tired of it. There's an essential Zelda

1907
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I feel we need to stay true to. We are

1908
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
still testing things, exploring our options.

1909
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
We haven't landed anywhere at this point. We're still

1910
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
seeing what we can do. What I want to do, not

1911
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
specifically with Link, but with the Zelda franchise,

1912
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I'm always striving to make something no

1913
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
one else can. Something that is so

1914
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
distinctly Zelda that it can only be done

1915
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
in a Zelda game. There are times when I

1916
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
hit walls and I can't come up with new ideas and I

1917
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
think, maybe I should just give up and quit. But,

1918
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
eventually, a new idea comes along and I'm proud of myself.

1919
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It breathes new life into the creative

1920
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
process. I go through these phases

1921
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
over and over again. I hope those high points keep

1922
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
on coming. Alright, despite the whole

1923
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
fact that he says he's getting tired of it, I

1924
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
wouldn't read too much into that. I just would think

1925
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
that the next game is going to

1926
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
probably not necessarily

1927
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
be quite like

1928
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Skyward Sword and Twilight

1929
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Princess and all that. It might have some

1930
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
differences. But, we've already heard about that.

1931
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I remember a story about three, four months ago

1932
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
that Skyrim was influencing

1933
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Zelda as well, a little bit.

1934
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Maybe something more open world?

1935
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I would, well, I mean,

1936
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Zelda kind of already is

1937
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
pretty open world, the more recent ones.

1938
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
But, I mean, maybe a little less,

1939
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I mean, the dungeons

1940
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
could be fluid, but it isn't even like that

1941
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
in Skyrim. I mean, you go through a

1942
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
transition from open world to...

1943
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I used to be an adventurer, but I took a hookshot

1944
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
to the knee.

1945
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Shut up.

1946
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I think what's going to be neat

1947
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
is that, you know, Nintendo

1948
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
is very passionate about the whole two

1949
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
screen thing. And I'm sure they're

1950
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
going to think of a way to really incorporate

1951
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
the two screen thing into

1952
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Zelda and do it well. And if I knew

1953
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
what that was, then I

1954
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
would be making the new Zelda game. But

1955
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I'm pretty sure when we see it, we're going to be like

1956
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
that's pretty awesome. And, you know,

1957
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
how did Zelda work without this before? I think

1958
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
they'll be able to do something with this.

1959
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Slidekick

1960
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
is in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1961
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
and says, that's great news. I love

1962
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Zelda, but Skyward Sword was a step forward

1963
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
in the right direction and they need to continue to

1964
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
experiment with it. So,

1965
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
there you go.

1966
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Hopefully we'll get more info on this soon.

1967
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
But in the meantime,

1968
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
let's go back to a more classic

1969
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
era of video games.

1970
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I was really short. Let's go

1971
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
to when Zelda 2 was

1972
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
completely breaking the formula and some

1973
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
people hated it for that. No, no, no. Let's go

1974
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
earlier than that. Let's go even earlier

1975
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
than that. Let's go to me being

1976
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
six years old. Oh my God.

1977
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Is this a game

1978
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
that was long like...

1979
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I had to stand on a step stool

1980
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
to play it. Was it

1981
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Pong? No. Not that

1982
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
old. Was it Space War? No.

1983
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Girl, please. Alright.

1984
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It's the classic game of the week. Dark Soccer's gonna

1985
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
jump into her gaming vault and pull a game

1986
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
out of her butt that she

1987
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
framed. Ah! No.

1988
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
It's Kangaroo.

1989
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I'm gonna jump right into it.

1990
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It was done by Sun Electronics

1991
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
distributed

1992
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
by Atari.

1993
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
It's sort of

1994
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
like a cross between Donkey Kong and Popeye.

1995
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
You basically play a mother

1996
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
kangaroo who has to rescue her baby,

1997
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
her little joey. You go through the

1998
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
tree tops and

1999
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
beat up monkeys. I was not aware

2000
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
that there were monkeys in Australia. Are there monkeys

2001
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
in Australia? There's kangaroos in Australia.

2002
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
But why are there monkeys?

2003
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
They just run

2004
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
the other direction. Okay.

2005
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
My thought is that

2006
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
they're really criminals because you know

2007
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
that's how Australia was started. Yes.

2008
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I know the Australians love it when you point that out.

2009
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I think that

2010
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
they're pink criminals.

2011
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So I'm gonna go with that. That's my head cannon.

2012
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
You cannot convince me otherwise.

2013
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
So you can punch apples and

2014
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
throw them at

2015
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
they

2016
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
throw apples at you and you can punch them and

2017
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
you

2018
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
can knock down the monkeys with it. So

2019
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
basically you go up ladders

2020
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
through trees to rescue your baby kangaroo.

2021
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
There are four different

2022
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
levels and basically like I said

2023
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
you rescue the joey

2024
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and you get apples thrown at you

2025
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and you get to beat up the mean monkeys.

2026
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
You can punch them with your boxing gloves

2027
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
and you can punch the apples

2028
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
and you can punch other fruit. You just go around

2029
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
punching shit. And then

2030
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
you have to watch out for the big

2031
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
ape who tries to take your gloves

2032
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
away. You can't punch him if you don't have boxing

2033
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
gloves. But I would just think

2034
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
that a kangaroo could kick him in the face.

2035
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Cause I imagine that being kicked by a kangaroo

2036
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
would really freaking hurt.

2037
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
So

2038
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
it's uh, the third level

2039
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
is the different one cause the baby kangaroo

2040
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
is um

2041
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
actually being held up by monkeys

2042
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and you get apples

2043
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
that uh

2044
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
basically uh get sent up on

2045
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
you for when you climb up there so you have to punch

2046
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
the monkeys several times until the cage

2047
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
is open. Punch the monkey.

2048
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
At least I didn't say punch the monkey.

2049
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Never mind, that's rude.

2050
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
So the music

2051
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
in the background is uh like

2052
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
old classical folk tunes. You have

2053
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
the American Patrol

2054
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
by F.W. Meachum

2055
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
and Oh Susanna

2056
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
and you have

2057
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Westminster Quarters where the bell

2058
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
plays to and

2059
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Marcia Alla Turca which was

2060
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
well

2061
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
music inspired by that

2062
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
by Beethoven so

2063
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
anyway it came out on the

2064
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Atari 2600 and the 5200

2065
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
which I have both copies of. The 5200

2066
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
version is super good.

2067
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Never play it with a trackball by the way

2068
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
because you will want to shoot yourself in the face.

2069
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Now

2070
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
kangaroo

2071
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
was actually involved

2072
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
with the Saturday Supercade. You remember that Rob?

2073
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I actually do. 1984.

2074
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Kangaroo and Space Ace

2075
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
replaced Pitfall Harry, Frogger and Donkey Kong

2076
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Jr. for segments on that show.

2077
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And so basically the kangaroos

2078
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
were Katie and Joey

2079
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
and they lived in a

2080
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
zoo run by Mr. Friendly

2081
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
and they were friends

2082
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
with Sid the Squirrel

2083
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
and they had to fight the

2084
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Monkey Biz Gang.

2085
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Which you know who won? Oh that's actually cool.

2086
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I didn't know that. One of the voices for one of the monkeys

2087
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
was Frank Welker. They were Bingo

2088
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Bango Bongo and Fred.

2089
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
You can actually get those on DVD.

2090
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
That's kind of cool. I need to go get those on DVD.

2091
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So yeah. Kangaroo.

2092
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Fun game.

2093
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Now here's my

2094
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
background story on this one.

2095
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Imagine 1982.

2096
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Six years old.

2097
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I'm in first grade.

2098
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
At Godfather's Pizza.

2099
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Kneeling on

2100
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
this weird stool trying

2101
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
to play freaking kangaroo.

2102
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And I kept running

2103
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
back for quarters because I was bound

2104
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
and determined to punch those damn monkeys.

2105
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And I punch the monkeys.

2106
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Tell us more about how you punch the monkeys.

2107
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I punch monkeys all the time.

2108
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
That's what they get for

2109
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
throwing poo and yanking it

2110
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
in the zoo. Monkeys are

2111
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
nasty little bastards.

2112
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I love

2113
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
monkeys. I love lemurs.

2114
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
If someone

2115
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
said, do you want a monkey or a lemur?

2116
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I pick a lemur every time.

2117
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Or a kangaroo.

2118
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I don't know what the hell that has to do with the game

2119
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
but that's so funny. Monkeys!

2120
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Punching monkeys. There it is.

2121
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
The Punching Monkey classic.

2122
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Kangaroo.

2123
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Available in arcades everywhere.

2124
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Punching monkeys.

2125
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Look for it where you can punch your favorite monkeys. Tigerclaw posted

2126
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
up the intro to the kangaroo cartoon.

2127
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
There you go.

2128
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
But you know what? Nothing is as awesome as punching a monkey.

2129
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I stand by

2130
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
my monkey punching. There's your classic

2131
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
game of the week. At least I didn't say

2132
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
donkey. I was waiting the whole

2133
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
time for you to make a donkey punch punch.

2134
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Anyhow. I wasn't going to say it

2135
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
but I did anyway. Let's take a break

2136
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
and Dark Soccer

2137
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
has got to go punch a monkey or two. When we come back

2138
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
with more of Orange Lawn's radio. Do you have

2139
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
monkeys? Lots of responses to the

2140
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
question of the week. No, just a cat and you can't

2141
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
punch her. She doesn't like that. I will punch

2142
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
her by petting her. And

2143
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
the mail bag, maybe. I don't know. There were no

2144
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
emails in there this morning when I looked.

2145
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
And your phone calls

2146
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
when we come back with more of Orange Lawn's

2147
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
radio right after this break.

2148
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Stay tuned.

2149
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Congratulations.

2150
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Congratulations.

2151
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Is my mic off? Hi.

2152
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Thanks to our

2153
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
friends at gamefood.org for that

2154
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
bumper. Appreciate it.

2155
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Sometimes I wish we

2156
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
did a tape show like they did so that way

2157
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I could cover up all those screw ups when they

2158
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
happen like I don't have my mic on.

2159
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
That's the second

2160
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
time you've heard that bumper. That's because

2161
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
we're not getting

2162
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
any more bumpers from our listeners.

2163
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Shame on all of you. So you should

2164
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
definitely send us some. Check the

2165
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
forums over at vognetwork.com

2166
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
and you can send us a bumper. And

2167
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
you can tell us whatever you want. Use your voice

2168
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
here on the program to tell

2169
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
us whatever. We have a lot of people

2170
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
giving their voices to the FUGL

2171
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
question of the week here in a little bit. But we'll

2172
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
play that. We'll get to that in a

2173
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
little bit here. But first we have some

2174
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
rapid fire news we've got to go over.

2175
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Loki.

2176
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Alright. Let's talk

2177
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
a little bit about

2178
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
the awesome game that is Saints

2179
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Row 4.

2180
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
And there was some wonderful

2181
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
news that came out from a panel at

2182
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Comic-Con

2183
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
actually. And they were talking a little bit

2184
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
about some of the scrapped ideas that they had.

2185
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Originally the end of the game was

2186
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
going to have a Bollywood dance number.

2187
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Which...

2188
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
that's awesome. Outstanding. Outstanding.

2189
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
The only problem was

2190
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
it wasn't possible for them to

2191
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
do that because of the cost.

2192
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
By the time they figured out which

2193
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Bollywood

2194
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
song to license

2195
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
and also

2196
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
doing all the choreography and stuff like that

2197
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
and the motion capture. It was just going to be too

2198
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
much. So they just couldn't

2199
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
end up doing that.

2200
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Although I'm sure the ending

2201
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
of the game is going to be awesome.

2202
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Apparently though they said that there's some really interesting

2203
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
details in the game. They're kind of calling it

2204
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
they're joking that

2205
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Saints Row is about the arts.

2206
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And I guess they have one of the in-game

2207
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
radio stations where the

2208
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
evil alien guy

2209
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Zinyak. He's

2210
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
actually reading a bunch of different classical

2211
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
literature including

2212
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
monologues from Shakespeare and

2213
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
even the entire first chapter of Jane

2214
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Austin's Pride and Prejudice.

2215
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Spoiler alert!

2216
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I will not be listening to that station.

2217
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I've been listening to the dubstep dance

2218
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
as I

2219
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
always do.

2220
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And probably flipping

2221
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
between that and the 80's station because I hear the 80's

2222
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
station is pretty awesome. Will you listen to your dubstep

2223
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
while you use your dubstep gun?

2224
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
No!

2225
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Assuming that I can fire

2226
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
that out the window, yes.

2227
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Most likely, no.

2228
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I can't leave this.

2229
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I can't wait.

2230
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
It's not much longer now, right?

2231
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
We're getting to that point of the year. It's getting closer.

2232
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
What is today?

2233
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
July 21st.

2234
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
We're like five weeks away

2235
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
from Final Fantasy 14

2236
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Realm Reborn.

2237
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
That's going to be a tight schedule.

2238
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Alright.

2239
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
So I guess here's a positive.

2240
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Xbox One is also going to support partial

2241
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
download support.

2242
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Or I should say partial download play.

2243
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Meaning that while a game is being downloaded

2244
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
you will be able to play

2245
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
the game thanks to the cloud.

2246
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Cool. When the cloud works.

2247
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
When the cloud works.

2248
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Final Fantasy 7 is an indication, though granted

2249
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
the servers are not even

2250
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
run by the same company.

2251
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Perhaps you have to level up

2252
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
cloud so that he has his limit break.

2253
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Limit break is cloud saving.

2254
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
No, you get the limit break at level one.

2255
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
You get to use limit breaks in the beginning of the game.

2256
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Where have you been?

2257
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Alright.

2258
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Uh oh. Troll comment in our chat room.

2259
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Not really, but live.vognetwork.com

2260
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I'm going to read it anyway.

2261
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
MaskedBishop in our chat room says

2262
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I'm still trying to figure out the selling point

2263
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
of the Saints Row series. Loki?

2264
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It depends which one you're talking about.

2265
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
The original Saints Row games were kind of like a

2266
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Grand Theft Auto. In fact

2267
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Saints Row 1 for me was

2268
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Hey, Grand Theft Auto is on the Xbox 360

2269
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I'm going to play this game. And it was fun.

2270
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I think kind of the last few

2271
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
games it's just been so over the top

2272
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
and ridiculous that it's entertaining.

2273
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
And Bobby is informing me yes

2274
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
You can listen to the radio anytime because it's cyberspace

2275
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
and the radio stations are injected directly into your brain.

2276
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Awesome. So yes, you can listen to the dubstep

2277
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
while firing the dubstep gun.

2278
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Hooray.

2279
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Well let me say this. In my experience

2280
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
with at least Saints Row 3

2281
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Saints Row is good

2282
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
for the same reason that This is the End

2283
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
was good. It's fucking ridiculous

2284
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
and dumb as hell, but you can't help

2285
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
but laugh. Like it's just over the top

2286
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
stupid. It's beyond over the top.

2287
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Yeah. And some of the things in that movie

2288
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
were just ridiculous

2289
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
but I laughed. Like it was so funny.

2290
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It's not. See Grand Theft Auto

2291
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
is trying to take itself like kind of

2292
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
like an Oscar movie I guess where it's

2293
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
very well done. Grand Theft Auto is a little

2294
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
ridiculous in itself. It is a little ridiculous.

2295
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Some of the things you can do. But they're definitely going

2296
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
along the lines of realism. Like the amount of

2297
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
detail that they have in the game with the whole

2298
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
like stock markets and

2299
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
you know just all the stuff you can do in the game

2300
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
it's you know they're going

2301
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
one way with Grand Theft Auto. Whereas Saints

2302
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Row is like kind of going the completely opposite

2303
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
direction. They're just like hey you know

2304
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
be fun as if we have super powers. Are we going to explain

2305
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
it. Whatever. He's in the matrix now

2306
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
OK. They're done. OK. Sweet

2307
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
You know hey we're going to have a gun that fires

2308
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
dubstep.

2309
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Whatever. It's just ridiculous. It's supposed to be

2310
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
ridiculous.

2311
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And that's the whole point. I mean if that's the type

2312
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
of game you want to play then play Saints Row.

2313
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I honestly think it should play both because

2314
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
they're both awesome. I will be playing

2315
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
both. A lot.

2316
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
So much so that I'm probably not going to get

2317
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
PlayStation 4 now. Maybe.

2318
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
BlackWolf and TimTrip

2319
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
are having a conversation in our chat room about it

2320
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
and BlackWolf says Tim

2321
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Saints Row 4 is basically Grand Theft Auto meets

2322
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Crackdown meets Over the Top Humor especially

2323
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
with their version of the Crackdown orbs.

2324
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Oh. Alan's here to give

2325
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
comment. Hi Alan. Hello.

2326
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Just want to say because I beat

2327
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Grand Theft Auto 4 all the way through just a couple weeks

2328
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
ago after the insanity of GTA

2329
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
3 San Andreas which there was a lot

2330
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
of crazy stuff in that. A lot of people thought

2331
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
that 4 proper with

2332
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Niko Bellic was too dry. Oh yeah. It's very

2333
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
bleak and just super serious. Well did you

2334
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
get to, did you play through the Valet of

2335
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Gay Tony? No. I'm only like an hour into

2336
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Lost and Damned.

2337
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Ok. When you get to Valet of Gay Tony it's kind of like they're trying

2338
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
to bring it back towards San Andreas.

2339
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And I think honestly that was

2340
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
like the best as far as like playing with the weapon

2341
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
set and stuff like that. It was the best. And then

2342
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I guess you can tell already from the gameplay trailer

2343
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
for 5 that they realized that they

2344
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
don't want to turn the dial up to Saints

2345
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Row crazy but they need to have

2346
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
more over the top

2347
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
stuff in it I think.

2348
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
They're just giving you more freedom without

2349
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
going crazy with the stuff that's in there.

2350
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
In San Andreas wasn't there like a big wheel? Like it

2351
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
wasn't mod you could just drive a big wheel around?

2352
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I don't

2353
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
remember. It's been a while. You could like parachute

2354
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
off buildings. A lot of crazy stuff and then 4

2355
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
was very

2356
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
very bleak.

2357
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Captain Spike in our

2358
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

2359
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I want games to be fun. Games and

2360
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
all. Not really here for Grand Theft Auto's 4

2361
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
story wants to be an Oscar winning movie

2362
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
bullshit or whatever. It was fun. You just don't

2363
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
play the main storyline. Who cares?

2364
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Once in a while I'm ok

2365
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
with Oscar worthy video games

2366
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
though. Like you know Journey is like a Night of the Met.

2367
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Seriously Saints Row the 3rd is fun. It's pretty

2368
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
fun. There's a little bit

2369
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
of repetition when it comes to some of the activities

2370
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
and stuff but I think Saints Row

2371
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
the 3rd was fun and Saints Row 2 was actually

2372
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
pretty fun so Saints Row 4 sounds like

2373
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
it's going to be a lot of fun too. Alright let's move on.

2374
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
We got to rail a little bit. Did you just say your thing?

2375
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
No no I haven't done that yet. Last

2376
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
but not least they're trying

2377
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
to bring back

2378
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
sort of a spiritual successor

2379
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
to Police Quest.

2380
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
It's actually being done by the same creator

2381
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Robert

2382
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Lindsley

2383
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I guess and he

2384
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
is trying to kick start a game called

2385
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Precinct and right now their funding

2386
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
goal is half a million dollars

2387
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
and

2388
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
so yeah

2389
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
apparently I mean the game is going to be very similar

2390
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
to I guess

2391
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
the Police Quest series and

2392
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
if you're looking to get a game similar

2393
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
to that then maybe you should try

2394
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
backing this. Right now as of recording

2395
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
they are up to $50,000

2396
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
actually close to $51,000

2397
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
still a ways away from their goal but they have 25

2398
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
days left so there is a

2399
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
chance and some of the concept

2400
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
art looks actually pretty sweet. It's all

2401
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
like first person you have like the patrol view

2402
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
and stuff like that so

2403
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
looks like it could be pretty cool.

2404
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Okay.

2405
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And I like their precinct funding

2406
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
chart here. They said our campaign

2407
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
they're you know $500,000

2408
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
awesome $600,000

2409
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
awesomer $700,000

2410
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
mega awesome

2411
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
$800,000 plus badonk.

2412
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Alright

2413
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
well hopefully this movie will be pretty

2414
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
badonk but the first signs of

2415
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
the World of Warcraft movie

2416
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
was shown at Comic Con. The teaser

2417
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
trailer unveiled at Comic Con

2418
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
but here's the thing the movie doesn't have any

2419
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
stars attached yet so there wasn't really a

2420
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
lot to show but the teaser did

2421
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
have a mix of live action and computer

2422
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
generated effects.

2423
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
It was out in a desert field and had an armored

2424
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
human warrior that drank a potion and

2425
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
drew a sword just before battling

2426
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
a hammer wielding orc.

2427
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Of course as we all know Duncan Jones

2428
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
who did Source Code and Moon and

2429
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
also importantly as David Bowie's son

2430
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
is helming the Warcraft

2431
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
film. It's supposed to begin

2432
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
shooting in early 2014. I'm assuming

2433
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
that means released in probably

2434
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
2015. Can Bowie

2435
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
get like a monarch

2436
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
you know position in the movie? I would love

2437
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
that. I would love that. Perhaps the

2438
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
king of the goblins? I think

2439
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I think the reason why he

2440
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
goes by the name Duncan Jones is he doesn't

2441
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
want to be in the shadow of his dad though so

2442
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I would I would really really

2443
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
be surprised if David Bowie turns up in this

2444
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
at all. And maybe he can

2445
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
you know do a little dance magic

2446
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
dance. Now by the

2447
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
way this clip is not on the internet

2448
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
for us to see. I don't know if it leaked

2449
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
out to YouTube. I'm sure it's out there somewhere

2450
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
but Blizzard has said there is no plans

2451
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
to release the mood piece that

2452
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
was shown at Comic Con. That was only for

2453
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Comic Con and not for public

2454
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
consumption which I'm actually okay with

2455
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
because again it's not

2456
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
real footage from the movie so to speak

2457
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
because there's no stars attached yet or anything

2458
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
so interesting though that it's a human

2459
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
versus an orc

2460
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
the movie is also just called Warcraft

2461
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
it's not called World of Warcraft

2462
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
so I'm wondering if they're taking it way back

2463
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
like they might be taking the story way back

2464
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
to like the original humans versus orc story which

2465
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
is alright. As it should be.

2466
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Yeah I think I think fans would be

2467
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
forgiving if that's where they want to go with it

2468
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
so. It used to all be about Sylvanas

2469
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
and all that.

2470
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Moving on to some other quick news

2471
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
here.

2472
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Oh yes some voices

2473
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
being crowd sourced here

2474
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
for Oddworld

2475
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty

2476
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
If you would like

2477
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
to have your voice featured in the game

2478
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
as a Madonkin

2479
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
you can be in the remake

2480
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
there. You just have to record in a

2481
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
microphone there a few phrases

2482
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
and you make a Soundcloud account. Make sure things

2483
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
sound fine. Don't have a lot of feedback

2484
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
in the background or whatever. It's over on

2485
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
the official blog Oddworld.com

2486
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
and you have to get those in by

2487
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Friday July 26th.

2488
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
But you could have your voice featured in the game. I wonder if I should

2489
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
send something in. I think that might be fun.

2490
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I could use the recording equipment here.

2491
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
You have to say such things as

2492
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I'm pulling up the blog here. Some of the

2493
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
like

2494
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
it was very simple stuff. Some of it was like

2495
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
ow. Ogg.

2496
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
You know things like that.

2497
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Yeah. Which of course now it's not coming up

2498
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
but anyhow.

2499
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Let me try one more time.

2500
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
This link here might show it.

2501
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Live radio

2502
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
of course. There we go.

2503
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
The words to say are

2504
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
hello, okay, laughing

2505
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
giggling, angry hissing,

2506
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
pain grunts, death screams

2507
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
and bonus points for providing some sound

2508
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
effects for the wildlife of Mudos.

2509
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Birds, scarabs, elumes, etc.

2510
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Just

2511
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
get on the microphone. I'm a bird.

2512
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Make strange noises

2513
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
because somebody is going to have to listen to it.

2514
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Is your mic not on Dark Sakura?

2515
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
The chat room is bitching.

2516
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Oh you were muted.

2517
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Damn it Rob!

2518
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
That's awesome.

2519
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
That was totally my bad. Sorry Dark Sakura.

2520
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
That was not awesome. That was lame.

2521
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Boy we're all sorts of broken here at OLR tonight.

2522
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Sorry about that.

2523
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Anyhow, Dark Sakura

2524
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I have a new story to make it all better.

2525
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Alright, so here's the deal.

2526
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Capcom working on what

2527
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
they're calling a major IP for the Nintendo 3DS

2528
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
it's called Geist Crusher.

2529
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
It's a multiplayer game where you're going to

2530
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
fight monsters known as Geists

2531
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
or G-A-I-S-T-S. Geists.

2532
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Here's the thing though, Geist Crusher

2533
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
co-developed by Treasure.

2534
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
So there you go. The announcement's

2535
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
on Treasure's website, treasure-inc.co.jp

2536
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
so

2537
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Capcom and Treasure are coming

2538
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
together for this.

2539
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
So did that make it a little better?

2540
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I might be a little tingly.

2541
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Alright, then why don't you do some news

2542
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
with your now newly on mic.

2543
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Yeah.

2544
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Thanks Rob.

2545
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Well in other news

2546
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
it's actually not pulling up.

2547
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Great. Oh yeah, Valve

2548
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
while they will not give us

2549
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
a Half-Life 3 yet

2550
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
they are

2551
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Because they don't love you.

2552
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Oh, they don't love somebody.

2553
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So

2554
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
they are actually

2555
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
working with

2556
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
the

2557
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
modding community.

2558
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
So they're

2559
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
basically

2560
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Come on thing. I'm sorry

2561
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
it's my iPad being stupid.

2562
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
So basically

2563
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
they are doing the Half-Life

2564
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
campaign as a co-op

2565
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
and it's going to be put on

2566
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
for free and it's going to be

2567
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
available through Steam.

2568
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
So that is at least

2569
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
something new, right?

2570
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And it's the Sven co-op

2571
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
as a standalone game.

2572
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
In other news

2573
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
this makes me super happy

2574
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
there's an Adventure Time game

2575
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
It's actually

2576
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
going to be out

2577
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
in the fall

2578
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and 3DS

2579
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
and it's called Adventure Time

2580
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Explore the dungeon because I don't know.

2581
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
So

2582
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I'm super, super, super

2583
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
excited. I like Adventure Time.

2584
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
And last

2585
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
but not least

2586
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
this actually makes me super happy

2587
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes

2588
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
has new characters to add to it

2589
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
including

2590
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Stan Lee

2591
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Howard the Duck

2592
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
and Squirrel Girl. I love Squirrel Girl

2593
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
because she kicked the crap out of Thanos

2594
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
and Doctor Doom and did it legit

2595
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
through the power of squirrels.

2596
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
So yeah, also included

2597
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
there's Doctor Doom, Jean Grey

2598
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
What exactly is the power of squirrels?

2599
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
She talks to squirrels. Her power is control of squirrels.

2600
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And she can speak squirrel language

2601
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
and she also has sharp teeth and little claws

2602
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
and a big bushy tail and she can climb

2603
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
up trees.

2604
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
She also can kick anybody's ass.

2605
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Apparently Squirrel Girl cannot be defeated by anybody.

2606
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
And she's also Jessica Jones' nanny.

2607
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
So that makes her super cool.

2608
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
But yeah, also

2609
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
confirmed is Doctor Doom,

2610
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Jean Grey, Elektra, Magneto,

2611
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Silver Samurai, The Punisher, Beast,

2612
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Gambit Storm, Green Goblin,

2613
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Juggernaut, Rhino, The Thing, Vulture,

2614
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Sabretooth, and Invisible Woman.

2615
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So we also

2616
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
will have

2617
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Coulson in the game.

2618
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
And you have a pre-order exclusive

2619
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
The Iron Patriot and Deadpool.

2620
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
So there you go.

2621
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
There you go.

2622
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Alright, let's go to the foogle question

2623
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
of the week. Which, oh my gosh,

2624
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
this is one of the most popular ones we've ever asked.

2625
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
There's so many answers this week. I don't know what to do.

2626
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Alright, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

2627
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
You take Facebook

2628
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
and Google, you slam them together, you get

2629
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
foogle. And we ask a question of our

2630
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Facebook and Google Plus communities

2631
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
every week here on the show. And it's

2632
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
foogle. And I

2633
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
knew the news about

2634
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Strider was going to make Dark

2635
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Sakura very happy. And Dan, we talked

2636
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
about that in part A. I feel all squishy now.

2637
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
So I wanted to ask a similar question of the

2638
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
listeners tonight with the foogle question of the week. And that is

2639
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
what long dormant series would you

2640
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
like to see make a comeback? And I said

2641
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
listeners, you only get to pick one to try and

2642
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
keep the answers a little bit short tonight.

2643
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
There are alone

2644
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
like 23 answers on Facebook.

2645
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Should I read them all? That's a lot. Do eat.

2646
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I'm going to read them all quickly.

2647
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I'm only going to read

2648
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
like little bits and pieces. If I don't read the entire

2649
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
answer, I'm sorry. You'll just have to go

2650
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
read them for yourself. Facebook.com

2651
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
or Google Plus community.

2652
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Guess what? What? You're not really sorry.

2653
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Alright. VX JasonXV says

2654
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
bust a groove. But

2655
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
this also means it will probably end up a

2656
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
connect, move, or wiimote dancing game.

2657
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Bust a move. Move.

2658
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Well, it depends what country.

2659
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Unfolded Raptor says

2660
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
new Gex game. Even if it's not

2661
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Gex 4, just a really nice reboot.

2662
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Rob

2663
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
himself says a remake of California

2664
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
games because he played that to death

2665
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
on the Sega Master System along with Strider.

2666
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
James

2667
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
S says I want a new entry to the Soul

2668
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Blazer saga, but I'd settle for a remastered

2669
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia

2670
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Terra Enigma trilogy for my 3DS.

2671
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
That is a fucking great answer.

2672
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I'll have you know. I would love

2673
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
that too. Jeremy J,

2674
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
our buddy from Koopa Club says Mega Man.

2675
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
See, here's the thing with

2676
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Mega Man though is that although Capcom

2677
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
has been really, they've just

2678
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
been dicks about it to an extent.

2679
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Like, at least

2680
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
there was Mega Man 9 and 10

2681
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
and those weren't that long

2682
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
ago all things considered. And

2683
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
the Mega Man and Smash Brothers thing, now

2684
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I admit, I as much as the next person would

2685
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
like to see a new 3D Mega Man Legends

2686
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
or just like in a Mega Man 11

2687
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
in the 2-bit style or you know

2688
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
kind of like a 2.5D kind of

2689
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Mega Man game I think would be awesome, especially maybe

2690
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
on like the Wii U or something, but

2691
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I don't know. Mega Man's not

2692
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
as

2693
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
it hasn't been as horribly long

2694
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
for Mega Man yet as some other games

2695
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I can think of like on the Nintendo and so forth

2696
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
but. Like I don't know

2697
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
the Guardian Legend. Yeah

2698
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
right. Seriously? I don't think anybody

2699
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
answered Guardian Legend to which I

2700
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
say all fail. All these people are wrong. Yeah

2701
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
so it's unfortunate that all of our listeners had to be wrong

2702
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
tonight. Alright

2703
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Gaming Nerd said a new

2704
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Alex Kidd game. He's been featured

2705
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
in Sega collections but never a new game

2706
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
or a remake of his own. It would be nice to

2707
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
see Alex Kidd come back wouldn't it?

2708
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
DJ Rama S says

2709
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
one of the most underrated and underappreciated fighting

2710
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
games, Rival Schools.

2711
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Yeah I love Rival Schools. Zether

2712
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
says Gradius. Konami's kept it locked

2713
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
up for far too long. But didn't we

2714
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
have Gradius 5 just a few years ago?

2715
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Was it really that, not that long ago?

2716
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I don't think it was that long ago.

2717
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
William Murderface says

2718
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
a sequel to Darkwatch. It would be

2719
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Halo but with vampire cowboys.

2720
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
That'd be cool.

2721
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Fifth Dream says I was talking about Section Z

2722
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
and would love to see it make a comeback.

2723
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Kareem J says

2724
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Streets of Rage 4. Thanks.

2725
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Loco Poco

2726
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
says I'd love to see an Ill Bleed

2727
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
sequel. It was a great mixture of horror and

2728
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
camp.

2729
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Nikki E says Streets of Rage.

2730
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I still keep coming back to that game series.

2731
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Code Man says Mega Man Legends.

2732
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Rich B says

2733
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
not really a series but I've always wanted to see

2734
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
a follow up to Midnight Resistance on the

2735
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Sega Genesis. Midnight Resistance is a good game.

2736
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Yeah, I'll be. Especially

2737
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
something kind of like really off the radar

2738
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
like that. I think I've done it for Classic.

2739
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
You probably have at some point.

2740
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
But still I mean

2741
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
like he said in the answer

2742
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
there was never a series there, just one

2743
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
really good game that we want to see something

2744
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
else with.

2745
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Raginator says Samurai Showdown series

2746
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
provided that an update stays true to the

2747
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
original five games, 2D and Pixels.

2748
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
They actually said that they were completely

2749
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
closing the series off after five so I don't think that's happening.

2750
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Bastards. We'll open it back

2751
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
up.

2752
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Let's see. Edgar R says

2753
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
a new duck hunt.

2754
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
This time the dog dies.

2755
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Gamer Girl says

2756
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
even though this isn't a series I'd love to see Kid Chameleon.

2757
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I love that game. It's a good pick.

2758
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Chiggers says Altered Beast.

2759
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Yeah, make it

2760
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
better this time too.

2761
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
KNIM says Secret of Evermore.

2762
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I'd be happy if they released it again on anything

2763
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
but Square doesn't want my money evidently.

2764
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Yeah, Secret of Evermore kind of gets

2765
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
crapped on because it was the Square

2766
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
USA title and it wasn't really part of the

2767
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
second Detsetsu series. It was like a spinoff but

2768
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Secret of Evermore had some neat stuff about it.

2769
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Did you know that that was one of the first soundtracks

2770
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
that, what's his name, Jeremy Sulay

2771
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
that guy that does the soundtracks for Elder Scrolls

2772
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
and stuff? He did the soundtrack for Secret of Evermore.

2773
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
It was one of his first games ever. He was probably like 19

2774
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
when he did it. How's that game?

2775
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I think Secret of Evermore

2776
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
was really shit on when it first came

2777
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
out but like I think Time

2778
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
has treated it well and the whole like

2779
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
you know it wasn't as bad as everybody

2780
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
made it out to be at the time. It just wasn't

2781
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
a second Detsetsu game

2782
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
really even though they kind of tried to make

2783
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
it one.

2784
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Pika Uno says it would have to be

2785
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
the platform that got me into gaming in the first place.

2786
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Commander Keen would have to

2787
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
be 2D though.

2788
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Dark Tetsuya says with the resurrection

2789
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
and Capcom Arcade cabinet, how about

2790
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
a sequel or something to Black Dragon slash Black

2791
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Tiger? I want to say Magic

2792
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Sword was a sequel to it but there hasn't been another one

2793
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
since that. Maybe they could implement Oculus

2794
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Rift support.

2795
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Tim Tripp says

2796
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Free Space? I'd just like to see the

2797
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
return of the epic space combat genre.

2798
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Anomalous

2799
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Underdog says Vagrant Story.

2800
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I even thought of a name for it. Vagrant Army.

2801
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
You know we used to call that fragrant story

2802
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
because it stinks.

2803
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
No, I know it's not bad but that was the

2804
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
joke at my house. SSG100 Matt

2805
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
says really? No one's going to say Chrono Trigger or

2806
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Chrono Cross? It's long overdue.

2807
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Slidekicks says with the upcoming

2808
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
release of DuckTales Remastered

2809
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I'd love to see the return of more of

2810
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Capcom's classic Disney platformers.

2811
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Like a modern tale on the adventures

2812
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
in the Magic Kingdom. It's a fun blend

2813
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
of different games with a flawless Disney theme

2814
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
and I think a new version would even be more

2815
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
immersive. As long as it was more like

2816
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Nintendo Land and not so much like Connect Disneyland

2817
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Adventures which was sadly a big flop.

2818
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
But here's the thing though, is that Connect Disneyland

2819
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Adventures kind of was Adventures in the

2820
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Magic Kingdom. I mean, they

2821
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
really were the same type

2822
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
of thing. It's just that Magic Kingdom

2823
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
was out when you were a kid.

2824
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
So it was like, you know, it held up

2825
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
a little better than Connect Disneyland Adventures

2826
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
did I think.

2827
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
And lastly on Facebook, Shane says

2828
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Rising Xan. It will

2829
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
leave you with a theme, and I'll leave you with a

2830
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
theme song because that should be enough

2831
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
to spike some second hand sales of the game.

2832
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
How can anyone not love this? It's a Ninja

2833
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Cowboy.

2834
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Rising Xan was a fun

2835
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
game.

2836
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I'm gonna skip ahead a bit.

2837
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I'm gonna skip ahead a bit.

2838
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I like the idea of a Ninja Cowboy.

2839
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
But not as cool as the Ninja Pirate.

2840
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Uh, let's see. Anyhow,

2841
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
going to Google Plus,

2842
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
of which there's only four answers, but

2843
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Retertainment says Skate or Die.

2844
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
That was a fun one.

2845
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Biz says Pokemon Snap.

2846
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Travis H says Shining

2847
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Force. Ooh, this is a good

2848
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
answer. Act Def says Uniracers.

2849
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
That game was awesome.

2850
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
What?

2851
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Get out.

2852
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
You know what was kind of a sequel

2853
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
to Uniracers was Excite Truck

2854
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
in a way. Like, the same type of thing with the stunts

2855
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
and everything, mid-air and all that. A little bit.

2856
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
A little bit. Alright.

2857
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Lots of great answers you guys,

2858
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
except you all failed for

2859
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
not mentioning the Guardian legend. Get out.

2860
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Honestly though, the Uniracer

2861
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
or Unicycle should come back

2862
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
as a Smash Brothers fighting

2863
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
character. Yes.

2864
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
It'd be pretty sweet. It'd be awesome.

2865
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Well I suppose if Sega can have Daytona

2866
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
cars fighting, then we can have a fighting Unicycle.

2867
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
That's right. Or at least as like

2868
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
a power-up or something. Like Princess Peach can ride

2869
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
the Unicycle around and do tricks or something.

2870
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I don't know. Alright, let's get back

2871
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
to some more news. Loki.

2872
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Alright.

2873
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
So they're doing this really

2874
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
interesting promotion

2875
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I guess. It's Ouya's $1,000,000

2876
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Free the Games Fund.

2877
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
They're boosting Kickstarter games.

2878
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Or Kickstarted

2879
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
games I guess. So what's

2880
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
going to happen is I guess between August

2881
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
9th and August 10th

2882
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
next year

2883
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
any

2884
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
or I guess a game will

2885
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
qualify as long as it's achieved its

2886
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
minimum goal of $50,000.

2887
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
And Ouya

2888
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
will match the total raised up to

2889
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
$250,000.

2890
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
So I'm guessing this is going to be

2891
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
quite limited if you're

2892
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
going to only have a million

2893
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
dollars to shuffle around

2894
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
and

2895
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
you're going to pledge with

2896
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
$250,000.

2897
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Also I guess the

2898
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
game will receive an additional

2899
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
$100,000

2900
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
if I guess it's

2901
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
one of the most

2902
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
successful Kickstarter projects

2903
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
to take part in the Free the Games program.

2904
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I believe

2905
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
that the trick

2906
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
with that, there is a big

2907
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
but, you

2908
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
need to have your game

2909
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
exclusive for the Ouya for six months.

2910
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
So

2911
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
that's the only

2912
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
drawback I guess.

2913
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
That's cheating.

2914
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
But hey, free money.

2915
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Money's good.

2916
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
I don't know.

2917
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Money is always good, of course.

2918
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
But don't they have to fix some of these other

2919
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
problems, like their customer service and so forth first?

2920
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
God, that's what I suggested. I'm like, hey, you know

2921
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
the problem is

2922
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
that you don't have enough games on the system.

2923
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Although more would be good.

2924
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
More would be good, but I don't

2925
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
think you're going to get, I mean look at this.

2926
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I understand that games

2927
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
have budgets and stuff like that and

2928
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
they can be quite expensive, especially if you have a team of people.

2929
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
But

2930
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I don't know, for like an indie game, I would think

2931
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
like $100,000 is

2932
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
quite a bit. I mean

2933
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
especially if you're talking like a small team of people.

2934
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
And that's a

2935
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
lot of money.

2936
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I think, I don't know. But even like

2937
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
let's say if we're going to take the high

2938
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
end here and you have $250,000

2939
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
so a total of half a million dollars

2940
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
for

2941
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
a game, I mean that's quite a bit.

2942
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I mean it'd better be one hell of a good

2943
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
game. I mean there's some pretty decent

2944
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
games on there right now, but

2945
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I don't think any of them cost half a million dollars

2946
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
or even $100,000

2947
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
to make.

2948
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Alright well moving on

2949
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
to a little

2950
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
quote about a spinoff for

2951
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
a very well received game from this year.

2952
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
It has to do with the Tomb Raider series.

2953
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
And Gail Simone,

2954
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
who is a comic book veteran.

2955
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
She is awesome.

2956
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
What kind of other stuff is she doing? I don't follow comics.

2957
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
She's the only, one of the only reasons I ever

2958
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
read anything DC on purpose.

2959
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
She did

2960
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
what did she do?

2961
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Birds of Prey.

2962
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Even I know what that is because that was a CW show.

2963
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
But

2964
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
she is probably one of the

2965
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
best female comic book writers

2966
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
out there. Awesome. Well she's teaming up

2967
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
with publisher Dark Horse

2968
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
to work on a Tomb Raider comic.

2969
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
But what caught people's attention was this quote.

2970
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
She said quote,

2971
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
In continuity it will be a Tomb Raider canon

2972
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
and lead directly into the sequel.

2973
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
This is what got me excited.

2974
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
We get to be part of Lara Croft

2975
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
history. Well they haven't

2976
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
announced a sequel to Tomb Raider.

2977
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
So this quote kind of

2978
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
grabbed people's attention. Although

2979
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I mean let's be real. It would make

2980
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
a lot of sense. Like you didn't

2981
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
expect a sequel. Exactly right. Like the game

2982
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
was well received. It did perform under.

2983
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Well but we all kind of

2984
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
looked at that quote in the beginning and kind of went

2985
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
really? Really with that

2986
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
quote? Are people just pulling this way out of context?

2987
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
A? Why not

2988
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
A plus?

2989
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
That's right. Well

2990
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
plus I would think that if they're

2991
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
going to make a sequel it's going to

2992
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
likely use a lot of the same components

2993
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
that were in the original. So like I'm saying

2994
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
they don't have to necessarily reinvent the wheel

2995
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
with a sequel. They can carry over

2996
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
a lot of stuff that they did with the first game.

2997
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I mean granted they'd want to do bigger

2998
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
better and all that other stuff but. How more

2999
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
can we kill her more?

3000
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Right. But I would

3001
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
think that you wouldn't necessarily maybe have to

3002
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
put the same financial

3003
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
investment into it

3004
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
necessarily. So maybe you could

3005
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
still get bang for the buck.

3006
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
And maybe make up for this

3007
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
perceived lack. Although

3008
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I don't know. Again

3009
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I still think it seems like the game's

3010
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
done well. And I'm sure it sold a ton of extra copies.

3011
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
What was it? Eight bucks on the steam

3012
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
sale this week. And I'm sure there were a lot of people

3013
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
that snapped it up for that. So.

3014
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I've had a lot of fun playing it

3015
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Some other comments from

3016
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Gail Simone. The storytelling in the game

3017
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
hooked me instantly. The biggest difference

3018
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
is the game told a claustrophobic

3019
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
story in an isolated setting. We are

3020
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
going globe trotting.

3021
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
So maybe if there is a

3022
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
sequel. If this ties into it.

3023
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
It'll be more Laura exploring

3024
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
rather than the whole you know escape from

3025
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
you know Death Sentence Island.

3026
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
She'll be seeking the legendary

3027
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
elusive art thief

3028
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Carmen Sandiego.

3029
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Alright.

3030
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
So. Anyhow.

3031
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Exciting that. I mean.

3032
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Although I think a sequel to

3033
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Good Game is a bit of a duh. It's still

3034
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
exciting to hear that. Speaking of franchise

3035
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
reboot. Carmen Sandiego.

3036
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I heard about

3037
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
this. PBS has been teasing this

3038
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
right? No. I was just saying they should do

3039
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
a sequel. No. Like for real. Like PBS

3040
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
on their Tumblr or Twitter

3041
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
these things was posting these things

3042
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
about like. No. No.

3043
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Actually no. It wasn't PBS. I think it was the people

3044
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
that owned Carmen Sandiego or like her Twitter.

3045
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
But like I think they're doing something where they're gonna

3046
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
play the old game show

3047
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
things again on PBS.

3048
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Somebody in chat can help me fill in the gaps. I just remember

3049
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
picking up bits and pieces of this on Twitter.

3050
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
But like I think they are setting the stages

3051
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
for a Carmen Sandiego comeback. So it's funny that you

3052
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
bring that up. Cause like. No. Legitimately

3053
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
there's something to that. You know what would be

3054
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
funny? If you

3055
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Where in the world is

3056
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Carmen Sandiego would have worked in the 80's?

3057
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
But imagine like having

3058
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
that now. People be like well just can't we

3059
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
like do GPS and use CCTV

3060
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
and all this.

3061
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Yeah we found her in 5 seconds. Oops.

3062
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Send a drone.

3063
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Or more like

3064
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
What country? Where's that?

3065
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I've never heard of that country.

3066
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
China. What is this? Oh stop.

3067
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Alright.

3068
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Roo that's made up.

3069
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
You're

3070
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
so ignorant. Alright Dark Soccer

3071
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
what do you got? Stuff.

3072
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
And it's not Carmen Sandiego.

3073
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
It's about Atlas.

3074
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Basically Nintendo. Well you know

3075
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Atlas filed for bankruptcy and everyone's

3076
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
worried about a

3077
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
particular series of their Shin Megami Tensei.

3078
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Well Nintendo is buying it.

3079
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
So we may see a Persona 5 Wii U.

3080
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Yeah you made a noise.

3081
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
I'm sorry. Sorry no I was laughing at chat.

3082
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Sorry. But yeah.

3083
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Atlas kind of

3084
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
screwed themselves.

3085
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
But Nintendo seems to

3086
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
be grabbing the hot one.

3087
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Because you know all the fans that was what they were

3088
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
worried about. What's going to happen with a

3089
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Persona with a Shin Megami Tensei.

3090
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
So it looks like Nintendo is saving the series.

3091
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I thought this whole

3092
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
bankruptcy thing wasn't supposed to be this big of a deal.

3093
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
And now here we're talking Nintendo's

3094
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
snapping up

3095
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
IPs? Yeah.

3096
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
How did things go from A to Z

3097
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
like that? Well they've already been working with

3098
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Nintendo in this series because remember the crossover

3099
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
with Fire Emblem?

3100
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
It was like if you have Shin Megami

3101
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Tensei 4

3102
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
there had a

3103
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
crossover promotion with Fire Emblem.

3104
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
So if you had both of them you get like

3105
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
$30 eShop credit in North America.

3106
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So

3107
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
that was a big thing. But I think that

3108
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
there's a

3109
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
they're developing Shin Megami

3110
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Tensei cross Fire Emblem

3111
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
for Wii U. So I think

3112
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
it's gonna be

3113
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I think it's gonna

3114
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
definitely be... I would be something

3115
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
can you imagine if Persona 5 was a

3116
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Wii U exclusive? Now that's

3117
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
that'd be a pretty crazy

3118
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
grab there. Yeah it would be. But it's

3119
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
smart. It's smart move.

3120
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Oh yeah.

3121
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Just real quick off

3122
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
this is we were talking about Karma San Diego a second ago.

3123
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
So I pulled up that article

3124
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
that were on my LinkedIn chat and they were talking about

3125
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
different things. And then at the very bottom of course it said

3126
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
that

3127
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Shirlene Theresa Lynn

3128
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Thigpen the one that was the chief

3129
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
on the show. Oh yeah she passed away. Yeah she passed away

3130
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
in 2003 and stuff. But what I found a little bit

3131
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
disturbing is on

3132
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Wikipedia it actually shows

3133
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
where the resting place is. It tells you

3134
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
which cemetery she is buried in.

3135
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
What? There's a lot of Wikis

3136
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
that do that. Wikipedia has that on a lot of

3137
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
articles. That's kind of weird. Yeah no a lot of articles

3138
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
say that. And then there's this whole other site

3139
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
like there's a whole site dedicated... This is where they

3140
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
are buried I think. Yeah there's a whole site dedicated to

3141
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
like celebrity tombstones. I actually

3142
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I don't know if I should

3143
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
mention this in the show. I have friends

3144
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
that like do that. They go

3145
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
visit them. Like when they go to L.A. they'll go

3146
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
to the famous people. And I had

3147
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
a friend that went to the Pacific Northwest recently

3148
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
and went to some of those tombstones that are out

3149
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
there. And you know I don't like

3150
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
I don't know it's to

3151
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
me I'm like no thank you not my thing

3152
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
but they're not hurting anybody

3153
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
it's all a sign of respect. You know

3154
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
that's why they put tombstones out there so people

3155
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
can go pay their respects and so forth

3156
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
and you know my friends do this all tastefully.

3157
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
But yeah there are websites

3158
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
out there that have all the links to this stuff.

3159
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
There's also

3160
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
websites that display

3161
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
famous death masks.

3162
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Because there's actually still people today who do

3163
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
death masks.

3164
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
For anyone who doesn't know what those are basically there's

3165
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
a plaster cast made and then they're cast in

3166
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
bronze or sometimes

3167
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
clay or different things. But

3168
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
the death masks are basically

3169
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
the faces at death once they're

3170
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
you know ready to be buried and saved.

3171
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
But there's people who still do death masks to this

3172
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
day and there's websites that have all the modern death masks.

3173
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
So I'm going to have one done.

3174
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Do Walt Disney have one done?

3175
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I don't think so. I plan on having

3176
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
one done though. Really? Isn't that expensive?

3177
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
No. I know

3178
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
how much plaster and stuff costs.

3179
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Yeah but you can't do it yourself.

3180
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
No but I have. Rob how many artists

3181
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
do I know? That's true.

3182
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
It costs a lot to join that.

3183
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
What did it call the Neptune Society or whatever?

3184
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
The people that'll dump you at sea.

3185
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I told

3186
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
my funeral

3187
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
is going to be Jewish

3188
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
and easy. Pine box

3189
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
buried 24 hours later.

3190
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
No embalming. I've already

3191
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
mentioned I want to be flung out of a cannon

3192
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
at my work building during the lunch

3193
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
hour. That's all I want. We actually discussed what

3194
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Dan wanted today. What we're doing is we're

3195
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
putting him in his 69 Mustang Coupe

3196
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
loading it with explosives

3197
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
pushing it off a cliff and blowing

3198
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
it up in mid air. Awesome.

3199
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
So Genki style

3200
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
and Roger Corman style.

3201
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Fancy.

3202
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Yes. I am having

3203
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
a Jewish burial and an Irish wake.

3204
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Are you calling us unoriginal?

3205
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Yes. Alright moving on

3206
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Loki. So

3207
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Harmonix is due some

3208
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
sweet sweet money.

3209
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
And that's because Viacom

3210
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
they lost their appeal.

3211
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Which you know there was a whole lawsuit

3212
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I guess that they had owed

3213
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Harmonix some

3214
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
money. And

3215
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
that includes now

3216
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
$299 million dollars with

3217
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
interest.

3218
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
So good for Harmonix.

3219
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
That should fund some extra

3220
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
tracks in Fantasia.

3221
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
I guess now

3222
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
it says Harmonix is

3223
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
law firm estimate or estimates

3224
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
including another dispute I guess

3225
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
the company has for a total of

3226
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
$533 million dollars.

3227
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
That's a sweet chunk

3228
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
of change.

3229
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Maybe that change

3230
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
can go to making 3D versions

3231
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
of all their old games cause that's what some

3232
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
companies do. Although a 3D

3233
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
amplitude would be pretty sweet you gotta admit.

3234
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
But Sega is

3235
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
jumping on the 3D bandwagon. We kinda

3236
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
knew this was coming cause there's been hints about

3237
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
the 3D Sonic already. But

3238
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Sega did make the official announcement that Sega

3239
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
classic 3D titles for the 3DS are

3240
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
coming to the west. So this isn't

3241
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
just you know virtual console releases

3242
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
they are redone in the 3D.

3243
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I wouldn't expect a whole

3244
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
lot more. I mean that's

3245
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
really it. Like I don't think they're going back and redoing all the graphics

3246
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
or anything like that so don't get your hopes too far up.

3247
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
But you will be able to experience

3248
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
3D Altered Beast, 3D

3249
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Echo the Dolphin, 3D Galaxy

3250
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Force 2, 3D Shinobi 3,

3251
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
3D Sonic the Hedgehog, 3D Space Harrier,

3252
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
3D Streets of Rage, and

3253
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
3D Super Hang-On. I think that should look

3254
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
pretty cool considering that you know

3255
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
some of the 3D converts we've seen so far have been

3256
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
NES titles and now these are like 16 bit

3257
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
so. 3D Space Harrier

3258
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
is gonna be sweet. I like

3259
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
3D Kid Icarus was really

3260
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
cool. Like they didn't change a

3261
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
lot but it was just like it was very subtle

3262
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
like they added the backgrounds

3263
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
very subtle updates that

3264
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
made it really cool. Like I like that

3265
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
one a lot. But like some

3266
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
of the 3D remakes were a little silly

3267
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
like 3D Wrecking or no not Wrecking Crew

3268
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
with Urban Champion or whatever that was

3269
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
a little silly. But yeah it'll be

3270
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
cool to check out a couple of these

3271
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
I don't know about 3D Altered Beast like

3272
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I don't... Wise Fumio

3273
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Grave. Like people remember

3274
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
that epicness from the arcade when they were a kid

3275
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
and stuff but like I played through the game recently

3276
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
it's really not that good. It's really

3277
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
not that good. But 3D

3278
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Sonic will be cool even though it'll be like the

3279
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
17th time I've played Sonic.

3280
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
But 3D Space Harrier. Yes I'm here for that.

3281
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Welcome to the fantasy zone. Get ready.

3282
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I'm getting ready.

3283
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
My body is ready.

3284
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Are you in the fantasy zone Rob?

3285
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Yes. Alright are you in the mailbag

3286
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
zone? Do we have you? Yes we have two.

3287
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
We do have emails tonight. Woohoo!

3288
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Two whole emails. You can email us

3289
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
too. Mailbag at orange

3290
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
lounge radio dot com. Well great I better

3291
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
pay attention cause I have no idea what these are about tonight

3292
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
I didn't get to read them in advance. Well this comes from Brad

3293
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
our pod culture Brad. Hi

3294
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
pod culture Brad. At the end of part A

3295
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
you guys said there were not any emails

3296
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
yet so how about a kitty pic instead.

3297
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
So they sent us a picture of his kitty

3298
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
pat on the screen. Oh

3299
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
that's adorable. Hi kitty.

3300
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Gee cat.

3301
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I'm gonna get to meet Brad in

3302
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
five weeks. Kitty unfortunately cannot check in for points

3303
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
for the VOG network cause kitty does not have

3304
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
a cat phone. I am super pissed at my cat.

3305
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Why? Because she's trying to chew

3306
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
on my 3DS charge cable.

3307
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
And every time I move it out of her way

3308
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
she's like uh uh I'm gonna get it.

3309
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Meow.

3310
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
You need to buy her a shoestring or something.

3311
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I have toys for her. She plays with all of

3312
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Shermy's toys cause Shermy's too fat and lazy.

3313
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
But except I won't give her

3314
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Shermy's mousy. But

3315
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
you know what this house that we're looking at has a

3316
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
cat door in it.

3317
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Hee hee. Nice.

3318
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Next email. Hey it's

3319
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Ricimo. I haven't called

3320
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I haven't emailed or called in like forever

3321
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
but just a quick thank you for all your hard

3322
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
work and dedication to your craft and to your

3323
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
fans. I've been listening since I first

3324
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
heard about you guys on Joystiq.

3325
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
We were on Joystiq. We were on Joystiq.

3326
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
When the hell did that happen?

3327
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Oh.

3328
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Uh

3329
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
yes they used to do like a weekly

3330
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
podcast thing and I think we were

3331
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
featured once. Actually

3332
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I remember Playstation Joystiq

3333
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
site did a really

3334
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
nice write up on OLRPSP.com

3335
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
some time ago. That was really cool.

3336
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
And I want to say

3337
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
probably when the whole

3338
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
when the whole Katamari

3339
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
thing happened years ago that was probably

3340
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
on Joystiq. The president cat

3341
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
thing was written up on I think that hit

3342
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
a couple blogs and Joystiq was one of them too.

3343
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
So it was a while ago. But I know Ricimo has been listening a while.

3344
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
So yeah I guess we have got a few mentions.

3345
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Now we need to get Gaga Hamster.

3346
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Yes which by the

3347
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
way just the Glamster

3348
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
was what we were going to call it.

3349
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Kuma JP bless his heart did

3350
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
do some research on Glamster

3351
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
and they don't have a Twitter it seems like.

3352
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
But he did get us the website.

3353
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
It's Bergsala-lightweight.co.jp

3354
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
So

3355
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
that's

3356
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I mean so there's the official site and they actually have

3357
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
a website for the Hamster game

3358
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
which had a

3359
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
very long Japanese name that I'm totally

3360
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
mispronouncing. But DarkSakura decided last

3361
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
week to simply call it Glamster which is a

3362
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
fantastic name for it because it was

3363
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
making the hamsters pretty and putting

3364
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
them in pretty situations and so forth and we're

3365
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
like why can't this game be out here. It's like the pretty pretty

3366
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
princess of hamsters. So I wanted to bombard

3367
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
their Twitter and try to take another social

3368
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
media campaign like we did with President

3369
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Kat to its

3370
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
horrendous success. But

3371
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
but

3372
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
no luck. There's no Twitter to bug

3373
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
them through. But we'll

3374
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
keep trying.

3375
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Of course you remember the

3376
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Katamari debacle of yesteryear.

3377
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
I haven't missed a single episode and felt

3378
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
the need to say thanks for getting me

3379
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
through so many work days. I love you all.

3380
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Thanks once again. Sent from my iPhone.

3381
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Well that was very nice.

3382
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
There was no questions or opinions

3383
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
or I mean opinions. I like nice

3384
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
emails. Thank you. That was just a good old fashioned

3385
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
thank you. Especially

3386
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
there was only one missing comma.

3387
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
This is

3388
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
quite pleased. Well and you're

3389
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
welcome and thank you for that.

3390
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
It's always really

3391
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
awesome to see things like that. You get

3392
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
an invisible gold star for awesome.

3393
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Yeah I got to say I so appreciate

3394
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
the small gestures

3395
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
people have done to just kind of say

3396
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
thanks for all our like you know

3397
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
code man got me Borderlands

3398
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
too because I was bitching about wanting it last week

3399
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
and he was kind enough to get that for me. That means

3400
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
a lot. And I got a trading

3401
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
card I wanted just because somebody

3402
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
had it and was like hey I like

3403
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
all our here have this I know you need it

3404
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
and didn't expect anything in return and I was like

3405
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
that's all. Even though those cards are only like 18

3406
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
cents still it's just like the gesture is like

3407
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
oh my god it's awesome. Usually the small gestures

3408
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I get are lewd.

3409
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I got a wiener for you DarkSakura.

3410
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Oh Slidekick found

3411
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
our article.

3412
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Some Google foo.

3413
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
About the president

3414
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
cat. There you go. Oh he found the

3415
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
he found the article from 2007

3416
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
that was about O.L.R.

3417
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
P.S.P.com I believe. This is 2009.

3418
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Which apparently no there's another

3419
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
article look at the link there

3420
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
that fixed info on DarkSakura

3421
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I wonder what they

3422
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
said about you that was wrong who knows.

3423
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Anyhow.

3424
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I have to see this.

3425
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
It's an old article. And I'll tell you what

3426
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
probably updated it the last

3427
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
time they ran that article.

3428
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
You know actually I'm getting

3429
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
the emails from GoDaddy

3430
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
to renew OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3431
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
which you know obviously that'll happen

3432
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
even though we really need to do something

3433
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
with that website to modernize it a little bit

3434
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
and get it away from the hackers

3435
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
but O.L.R. P.S.P.com

3436
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
is up for renewal and I'm questioning

3437
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
if I should renew it. Probably not.

3438
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
However you can still

3439
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I feel like there's people that'll be pissed off

3440
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
if I let it go. No no no no no no no hold on.

3441
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I just had a Facebook

3442
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
comment the other day. You can still access it

3443
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
by going to OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3444
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
slash P.S.P. Oh okay.

3445
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
So.

3446
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Alright then I feel better letting it go if that's

3447
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
going to be the case. Yeah cause in fact I'll

3448
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
still protect this real quick. You have such a cute kitty

3449
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Brad. Yeah I'm pretty

3450
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
sure it's slash P.S.P.

3451
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
I think that actually

3452
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
yes yeah see if you

3453
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash P.S.P.

3454
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Okay well that's cool. Then then yeah

3455
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I might let O.L.R. P.S.P.com lapse

3456
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
if there's still a way to get to it.

3457
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Alright. A lot of these pages

3458
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
don't work anymore. Ranma secret message

3459
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
send me some. I will.

3460
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Alright.

3461
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Tiger Claw says

3462
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
why not change O.L.R. P.S.P. to a mobile

3463
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
site. No.

3464
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Yeah I kind of feel the

3465
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
same. It's like that's a lot of work to maintain

3466
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
and I think a lot of the focus right now

3467
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
is also on building VOG network

3468
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
is kind of like the central hub and making that

3469
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
bigger and better. The network's okay on mobile.

3470
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Yeah and that you know I think

3471
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
the next step at some point for VOG will

3472
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
be a mobile app but that's

3473
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
you know in the

3474
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
future. Ways away.

3475
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Don't get excited about that. Long

3476
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
ways out. You'll probably see

3477
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
it'll come out around the time Zelda's

3478
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
finally out on Wii U.

3479
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Alright.

3480
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Let's see.

3481
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
That's it for e-mails right?

3482
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Yarr. If you want to send us some

3483
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
e-mails mailbag at orange lounge radio

3484
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
dot com. That means it's the time

3485
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
in the show when we do the FUs

3486
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
of the week.

3487
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
My

3488
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
FU goes to this

3489
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
cough that will not go away.

3490
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
The conditions of some of the houses we've

3491
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
seen because there were like burnt

3492
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
carpet and cat pee smells.

3493
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Some of these like the HUD houses

3494
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
oh my god it's so bad. And then

3495
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
another FU just to the housing industry in

3496
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
general because it's

3497
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
really like this weird

3498
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
huge mungus

3499
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
legal ebay game with

3500
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
houses. It's a pain in the ass.

3501
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
But we found a cute one.

3502
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
The conditions seem

3503
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
favorable. Not gonna get my hopes

3504
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
up too high but keep your fingers

3505
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
crossed for us. We found a good one.

3506
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
And

3507
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Rob it has

3508
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
perfect accommodations for a new studio.

3509
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Nice.

3510
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
I'll keep my fingers and my toes crossed.

3511
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Loki.

3512
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Just fuck you because I still don't have

3513
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
a fixed controller yet even though it

3514
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
sort of seems like it's going on the right track.

3515
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I thought the same thing back on July

3516
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
1st and

3517
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
look where we are now. So fuck them.

3518
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
That's it? That's it.

3519
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
My FU goes to the fact

3520
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
that I can't follow through things on

3521
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
things that I say I'm going to do and

3522
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
convince myself that I'm going to do but then I'm just

3523
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
like, but you

3524
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
can't really do that even though you probably

3525
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
should. Go to the gym Rob.

3526
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
It's not even that I'm talking about actually.

3527
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
I could put that on the list.

3528
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
As one of many things. You should go to the gym

3529
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
with me. I can't because you don't go to the same

3530
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
gym I do. Yes I can.

3531
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I can get guest passes. Hello. You gonna switch?

3532
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
No I can get guest passes.

3533
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
That would work like once or twice.

3534
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
And then they'd try to bully me into joining and I don't want

3535
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
to join because I like the gym I've got.

3536
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Ours has got a heated pool.

3537
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Alright. Anyhow.

3538
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Back to

3539
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
a couple more news stories in the

3540
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

3541
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

3542
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
So

3543
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I guess that Namco is

3544
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
prepping a HD

3545
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
version of Soul Calibur 2.

3546
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Soul Calibur 2 HD Online

3547
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

3548
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
this fall. I'm assuming

3549
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
it's a download title because I haven't seen

3550
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
anything on here that says that

3551
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
it's gonna be

3552
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
released at retail.

3553
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I know I haven't heard of anything yet

3554
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
about retail. But uh

3555
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
yeah apparently the game

3556
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
is gonna be

3557
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
closer to HD now

3558
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
and the outputting at 720p

3559
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
um

3560
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I don't know.

3561
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Neat.

3562
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I'm assuming that the special characters aren't gonna be in the game.

3563
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
He probably can't get spawner.

3564
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
You know obviously Link's not gonna be back

3565
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
because he was only on GameCube.

3566
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
And Heihachi.

3567
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Yeah.

3568
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
So no Link.

3569
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Yeah well yeah because that was GameCube.

3570
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
So I don't know.

3571
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
It's bad it's not coming to Wii U.

3572
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Yeah

3573
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
that would be nice wouldn't it.

3574
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
But you never know. I mean you never know.

3575
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I'm kinda not getting my hopes up.

3576
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Yes.

3577
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Yes it does. Be quiet.

3578
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Stop trolling.

3579
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Alright well one more news story for you guys

3580
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
before we open up the Skype line and uh

3581
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I gotta say this is a really

3582
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
crazy idea but I totally love it.

3583
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
It's a site called

3584
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
All You Can Arcade

3585
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
and you can visit it at allyoucanarcade.com

3586
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
In a nutshell

3587
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
it's basically trying to be like a Netflix type thing

3588
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
for arcade cabinets.

3589
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Yes it's a business where arcade

3590
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
rentals are the focus.

3591
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
For $75 a month

3592
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
but we're talking cabinets people I know that sounds expensive

3593
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
but basically you can

3594
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
cancel your membership at any time

3595
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
or whatever you sign up for this

3596
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
and you can have 1, 2 or 3

3597
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
games brought to you

3598
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
and you can swap them out for a different one in stock

3599
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
or whatever. Now it's only

3600
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
in certain areas because they bring

3601
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
the games to you which is pretty amazing.

3602
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
It's only available in the San Francisco Bay Area

3603
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Stockton, San Jose, Sacramento

3604
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
and Sacramento. Yes Sacramento

3605
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
has it. So if

3606
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Dark Soccer wanted to do this or whatever

3607
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
And I have a job now. Can we check this

3608
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
stock? And they're saying

3609
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
in order to help scale the business we're partnering

3610
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
with other arcade coin operators and have our

3611
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
have set our website up so that anyone who

3612
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
owns a game can become an operator by listing

3613
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
photos of their games for rent. They can also

3614
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
set how far of a territory they're willing to cover

3615
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
on their route and our system will automatically

3616
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
find visitors who live within those zip codes

3617
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
and match their games with local homes and offices

3618
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
that want to rent them. This is actually aimed

3619
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
at private collectors too

3620
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
which is crazy.

3621
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I mean it's very ambitious.

3622
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
I should probably share that with Dan's

3623
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
pinball group. Yeah I mean

3624
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I didn't see if there were actually

3625
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
but yeah some of the cabinets they have on here

3626
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
most of them are old stuff but still

3627
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
you know bad dudes

3628
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Ms. Pacman looking at the site

3629
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
which we're totally just giving him free advertising

3630
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
here but whatever it's a neat

3631
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
idea and it's really taking the Netflix

3632
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
thing to the next level isn't it? I love the totally

3633
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
fake picture though. Oh yeah

3634
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
these little gals playing in the game

3635
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
and having fun. And the little black dresses and heels. Dude

3636
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
versus Goonies that's awesome I want that.

3637
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
That's cool.

3638
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Where can you view what they have?

3639
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
All You Can Arcade dot com. Yeah I went there.

3640
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Signing up and

3641
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Oh you can actually browse games available in my area.

3642
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Wow. Where? I put in my zip code here

3643
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
just in the upper right corner. Okay.

3644
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Bad Dudes, Berserk,

3645
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Donkey Kong, Galaga,

3646
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Golden Tee. This isn't all

3647
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
of them I'm just looking at. Heavy Barrel is a good one.

3648
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Silkworm. Yes.

3649
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
What? Silkworm. Dance of the Revolution Extreme.

3650
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Ha Ha. Get out

3651
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
really? Yes.

3652
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Oh my

3653
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
God there is a DDR

3654
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
machine. But you were just looking at area.

3655
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Oh yeah I was

3656
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
looking at area. This is looking at Sacramento.

3657
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
It might not be available in your area necessarily.

3658
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
But

3659
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
still that's the type of game they're willing to

3660
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
rent. One might show up Loki.

3661
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
They need a 2DX on that list. Oh boy.

3662
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I will rent it forever.

3663
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Alright. Yeah I may

3664
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
have to hog that if I actually. Hey if the idea

3665
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
does well and I just totally gave them

3666
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
free advertising. Dude

3667
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
I would totally just want to buy

3668
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
that. It's kind of neat.

3669
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
So anyway. There you go.

3670
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
That's it. That's it for the stories we had on deck

3671
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
tonight. So we're going to open up our Skype line if you

3672
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
want to give us a call. 1877

3673
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Game OLR. Our username on Skype is

3674
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
JoshLoungeRadio. If there's something you want to talk about tonight

3675
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
that we haven't brought up. We'll get to Twitter topics in a minute

3676
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
here. But first some last minute stories.

3677
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Darsakha I think you said you had one tonight right?

3678
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I do and I seriously thought I'd put it

3679
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
in my stories and I

3680
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
didn't. So this

3681
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
goes out to all the homestucks.

3682
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Basically Hussey. Oh God. Shut up.

3683
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Basically Hussey is

3684
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
going to be working with Namco

3685
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
doing a dating sim.

3686
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
The game is called Namco High

3687
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
and it is a fictional

3688
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
crossover high school that all

3689
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
the Namco characters are going to.

3690
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
So it's yeah date high school

3691
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
sim and

3692
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
so basically

3693
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
it's going to be Namco

3694
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
character shipping the game.

3695
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Like everybody does with Homestuck.

3696
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
So we're looking at characters from

3697
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Xenogears, Tekken

3698
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Idolmaster

3699
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Bites and Kratos so

3700
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
here

3701
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
we go with Pac-Man. That sounds weird.

3702
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
I'm totally getting it.

3703
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
That's weird it's like that one sim that they had

3704
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
where you date like birds.

3705
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Oh

3706
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Hat's a Full Boyfriend.

3707
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Alright let's go to the phones.

3708
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Hi you're on Orange on a Treaty who's this?

3709
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
It's the one and only Rama.

3710
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Rama how's it going?

3711
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Good good. I just got a

3712
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
brand new mixer on Saturday.

3713
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Oh congrats. So we're going to be hearing

3714
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
even more high

3715
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
fidelity anime jam sessions soon.

3716
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Either that or lots of margaritas.

3717
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
That'll happen

3718
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
provided Junami doesn't knock the desk

3719
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
over. Don't invite him to your house.

3720
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I told him he

3721
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
had to sign a release form first.

3722
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
In Junami's

3723
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
defense he came over on the 4th of July and didn't

3724
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
knock anything over. Good job. No

3725
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
he actually needs to come back to the show.

3726
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
It's been far too long.

3727
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
That sounds pretty cool.

3728
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Well congrats on your new mixing board. What else is up?

3729
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Not much

3730
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
but I want to

3731
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
stand behind Loki

3732
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
and join him

3733
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
in the lynching of

3734
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Uya because I have my own issues when it comes

3735
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
to gaming customer service and

3736
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
I was just close to literally

3737
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
losing my shit on Facebook and

3738
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Twitter before they got

3739
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
back to me.

3740
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Why don't you air your grievances here?

3741
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Long story short

3742
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
I bought a headset

3743
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
by Astro Gaming because I played

3744
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
them at PAX East last year and I

3745
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
loved them. So what happened was

3746
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
there was a short in the headset or

3747
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
the mic was dead. After

3748
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
waiting for the perfect time to pack up

3749
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
everything I pack up

3750
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
the microphone, the headset and the mixer

3751
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
because I was having troubles with that too.

3752
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Sent it out. Two weeks later I get

3753
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
a brand new mixer

3754
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
a brand new microphone

3755
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
same headset. And I'm looking

3756
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
at the new mixer and they're telling me the battery

3757
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
that I had works for it but

3758
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
the new mixer doesn't use the battery.

3759
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
There's a couple extra connectors on there

3760
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I can't even use my optical out because they

3761
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
change that. So I'm like whatever

3762
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I can work with it. I can still do my

3763
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
podcasting and the music and so forth.

3764
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Plug in the mic. Everything is working

3765
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
well. A week later

3766
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
the mic starts shorting out

3767
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
again. So

3768
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
I contact them and I'm like

3769
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
okay what they're probably going to do is send me a

3770
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
new kit. I pack up everything and send it

3771
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
back. They're like no we need you to pack up

3772
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
everything. Send it to us and we'll send it

3773
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
back to you. And I'm like

3774
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I use this for every day. I can't be

3775
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
without it. They should say

3776
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
okay we'll send you a two day

3777
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
UPS label.

3778
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I'm like you're not helping me here.

3779
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
So I

3780
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
end up going on their Twitter, their support

3781
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Twitter asking for help. I go

3782
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
on their Facebook asking for

3783
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
help explaining everything

3784
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
and I actually went as far as when I was

3785
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
at PAX East this year speaking to our

3786
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
rep at their booth to get this taken

3787
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
care of. Wow that's dedication

3788
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
to the cause. I packed

3789
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
up all my equipment took it down.

3790
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
It's because I actually like

3791
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
the quality of the equipment. It's just

3792
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
their customer service sucks. And

3793
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
every email I get back from them

3794
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
they don't

3795
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
have everything commented back. I've been sending

3796
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
an email. They keep responding back with

3797
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
the original complaint on the open

3798
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
ticket. I'm like are you guys not

3799
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
reading this? I'm sending them

3800
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
specific information about what's going on

3801
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
and how I want the situation resolved.

3802
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
I get a generic response

3803
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
coming back. Friday I

3804
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
check Twitter. I get a private message from

3805
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
their support saying they're so

3806
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
sorry since nothing has happened.

3807
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
No one's gotten back to me and it's been

3808
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
30 days. I get in my email

3809
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
an actual phone

3810
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
number where I can call them and talk to them

3811
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
and explain the whole situation.

3812
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Wow.

3813
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
But did that actually fix it finally?

3814
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Not yet because this past weekend

3815
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
I took a semi sort of sabbatical.

3816
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I just stepped away.

3817
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Just did my own thing. Tomorrow

3818
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
I'm going to call and just get this

3819
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
taken care of. Because like I said

3820
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
the headsets, the mixers.

3821
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
The stuff's really good. I can't complain

3822
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
because I use it for podcasting.

3823
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Listening to music. Gaming on

3824
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
my consoles. But when it just

3825
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
comes to support it's just like it lacks

3826
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
and people's defenses.

3827
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
They're mostly an online based

3828
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
company. You're going to

3829
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
be able to only contact them via email.

3830
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
I'm like no. There are other online

3831
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
companies where you can contact them not just through

3832
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
the forums. Support. Email.

3833
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Phone number. All that stuff.

3834
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Sadly I think there's a few too many companies

3835
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
willing to cut corners on customer service

3836
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
and it shows.

3837
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Yeah.

3838
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Alright well anything else. Any other grievances

3839
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
you want to air on tonight's OLR?

3840
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
That's it. I'll just say this. If you

3841
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
buy this, buy it from Best Buy.

3842
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Get their service plan.

3843
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
It'll save you a lot of frustration

3844
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
and hair on your head. Fair enough.

3845
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Alright. You take care Rama.

3846
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
You too bro. Alright. Bye bye.

3847
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Alright. Always good to hear from our buddy Rama.

3848
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here at

3849
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
The Voice Eagles Network. Totally.

3850
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
We wait for more calls at 1877

3851
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Game OLR or our username on Skype

3852
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Orange Launch Radio. Loki do you have anything for last minutes?

3853
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
I don't have any last minute stories

3854
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
but I'd like to once again

3855
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
because I threw around this idea on

3856
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Twitter and now I think I'm going to move

3857
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
forward with it which is

3858
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
the Loki's 24 hour

3859
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
total noob game jam

3860
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
basically an experiment

3861
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
because I've been going through this whole

3862
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
game making thing and actually just

3863
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
reading up a lot on programming

3864
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
and unity and all that fun stuff

3865
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
and now I just want to get my hands dirty

3866
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
with it and so

3867
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
the experience basically

3868
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I'm going to spend 24 hours putting the

3869
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
other game. Now obviously unlike

3870
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
regular game jams I don't have enough time

3871
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
to sit. It's not 24

3872
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
consecutive hours. Yes. Hold on because our

3873
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
phone's lighting up. We'll come back to

3874
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
your thoughts in a minute here but let's go to

3875
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
the phones. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio

3876
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
who's this? Hey hey hey

3877
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
it's lokilives46. Hey it's

3878
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
say that again it's

3879
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
lokilives46

3880
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
lokilives46 but

3881
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
no relation to rloki?

3882
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
No no no unfortunately not.

3883
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I guess it is a commonly

3884
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
used name from. Wait where did you

3885
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
get yours? Yours did not come from

3886
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
like Thor or anything. Yours came from

3887
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
the mask. I'm a fan of Jim Carrey. The mask

3888
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
way back when right? But some people

3889
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Yes yes I was originally

3890
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
it's actually a bit of a persona

3891
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I've taken up. Oh.

3892
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Yeah it was a very

3893
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
mischievous little brat. Wait so yours is

3894
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
inspired from the mask too?

3895
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Absolutely. Wow.

3896
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
You guys are kind of like distant cousins

3897
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
distant cousins or something. Alright.

3898
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Well I won't make you talk about your name anymore

3899
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
loki2

3900
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
or loki46.

3901
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
What's on your mind tonight?

3902
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Just sort of

3903
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
clearing up the discrepancies here but

3904
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I'm a bit of a

3905
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
tech geek myself.

3906
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Well so are we. You're in good

3907
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
company here at the Voice Geeks Network. I think we're all

3908
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
a little nerdy.

3909
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Anyways how have things been going for you guys?

3910
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
What's that? How have things been going

3911
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
for you guys?

3912
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Fantastic.

3913
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
How are you doing

3914
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
DarkSakura? That's what the listeners want

3915
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
to know. How the hell are you? I want this house.

3916
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
You want this house that you're looking at?

3917
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
She's house hunting. I'm longing.

3918
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Yes. But I'm employed now so

3919
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
that's good. And our loki is full of

3920
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
gummy bears but he just ran to the kitchen real quick.

3921
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Those gummy bears

3922
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I pity his poor soul right now.

3923
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Fine. What you're not a gummy bear fan?

3924
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
What's up with that? No

3925
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
it's just that high concentration of sugar.

3926
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I'm allergic to them. No I already

3927
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
ate some of them but

3928
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
there's no way I'm going to eat a ton of them.

3929
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
They'll seriously make me feel sick.

3930
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Alright fair enough.

3931
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Anyways I'll let you guys get back to it.

3932
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Okay fair enough. No games you want to talk

3933
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
about tonight or anything? What have you been playing?

3934
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
I've just been crazy busy

3935
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
with work so I haven't really had a chance to.

3936
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Well you better

3937
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
get on that last

3938
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
day of the steam sale. Last chance

3939
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
he gains at a discount put all that money

3940
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
to use.

3941
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Oh my wallet doesn't like those steam sales

3942
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I'll tell you that much.

3943
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Alright buddy well thanks for the call you take

3944
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
care. Yeah you too. Alright bye.

3945
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
He just

3946
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
called to ask how the hell are you?

3947
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Alive and kicking.

3948
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
It's hot. It's very courteous.

3949
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Yeah it is a little hot isn't it? It's not even

3950
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
like one of those. It's getting hot in here.

3951
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I'll make sure the AC is on while

3952
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I think it doesn't. Aren't you guys cooking a pizza

3953
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
or something? Oh yeah he's making a baked

3954
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
potato or something. Yeah I see.

3955
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I'm sure these walls are really insulated

3956
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
with the oven beaver. Yeah sorry.

3957
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Alright well while I make sure our AC

3958
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
is at full blast

3959
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
so it's not 24 consecutive

3960
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
hours. Not 24 consecutive hours because I just can't

3961
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I can't get that amount of free time

3962
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
anymore.

3963
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
So it'll be 24 hours total but it's

3964
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
kind of cool because what I'm hoping to do

3965
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
is actually have some well

3966
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
I want to live stream it

3967
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
we'll see if that's feasible or not depending on

3968
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
where I actually have to record and the times and that

3969
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
kind of stuff. I would like to live

3970
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
stream. At the very least it's going to go up on YouTube

3971
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
and I want some sort

3972
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
of interactivity with that

3973
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
so obviously chat room

3974
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
will be involved and

3975
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
I want to actually have polls at different parts

3976
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
you know during it

3977
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
like the first is going to be I think

3978
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
you know what concept should we go

3979
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
because I can make anything so

3980
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
what are we going to make you know

3981
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I'll come up with like a couple ideas

3982
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
and then maybe people vote on it and we'll go from

3983
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
there and then later on as we get more

3984
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
into it and hell I don't know

3985
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
if I'll actually create a game in 24 hours because I've

3986
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
never made anything before but I think I

3987
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
can do it. I love how you're doing your game jam

3988
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I've never made a game before but I'm pretty

3989
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
sure I could do one in 24 hours. Maybe

3990
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
I don't know.

3991
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
We'll try it I mean look at hell

3992
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I watched a video where someone made a game in 3 minutes

3993
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I mean it can be done it's just it's

3994
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
going to be a good game

3995
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
It's like the noob night

3996
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
that Bobby and I keep talking about for

3997
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Borderlands 2 except your noob night is

3998
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
programming. Yeah I think it'd be fun

3999
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
I just kind of want to do it so yeah

4000
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
as Bobby suggested make a poll on the

4001
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
forums so yeah I'll start off with doing that and we'll

4002
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
do updates in there and stuff

4003
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
and see where it goes

4004
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
because I think it'd be fun. I think you should try to make one

4005
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
of the OLR dream games. No no see I knew you would

4006
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
say that I knew you would say that but here's why

4007
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
I don't want to do that because I want to make if I'm going to make

4008
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
one of those it's got to be a good game I don't want to make

4009
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
my first experiment at like something that's going to suck

4010
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
one of those

4011
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
games no offense it's just you know

4012
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
I'd rather do it when I'm able to make something

4013
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
a little bit better you know

4014
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
it's a dream game after all we're not going to like just

4015
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
crap out something. Fair enough

4016
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
you want to make sure that it's

4017
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
the time is taken to get it right. Besides I have a lot of

4018
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
really crazy ideas for things

4019
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
I mean all sorts of silly

4020
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
things. Alright let me quickly

4021
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
go to some tweets at twitter.com slash

4022
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
OLR looking at

4023
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
a few tweets here s2100

4024
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Matt tweeted us about going to

4025
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
EA's NHL 94 anniversary

4026
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
mode party in New York City and

4027
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
he actually took some footage that he posted over

4028
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
on Facebook and yeah I saw

4029
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
that earlier in the week and it looks pretty cool

4030
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I like how they put that mode in there

4031
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
to kind of you know with the stars under the

4032
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
player and all that to kind of go back to the classic

4033
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
and I heard EA

4034
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
didn't really like him taking some of that footage but

4035
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I'm glad his rogue footage

4036
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
made it to Facebook after all.

4037
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Tigerclaw sending us a couple tweets

4038
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Oculus Rift is planned for PC

4039
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
and mobile but consoles not a focus

4040
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
which I suppose would go

4041
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
a ways in wasn't there some

4042
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
rumor about Playstation 4

4043
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
getting Oculus Rift at some point I want to say

4044
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
right around E3 there was some wank on that

4045
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Honestly it can support any platform

4046
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
it's just it's HDMI inputs

4047
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
it's basically

4048
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
it just has to output that display and it

4049
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
can work with pretty much anything so

4050
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
well

4051
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
actually no I take that back it's a little bit more complex

4052
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
than that but yeah I think they said consoles

4053
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
that you know one time and

4054
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
obviously if it has native support for

4055
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Unreal 4 you know

4056
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
both consoles can run that

4057
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
and

4058
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
you know source and I'm not really sure what

4059
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
other engines are going to be supporting it natively

4060
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
but more and more are

4061
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
supporting it so I wouldn't see why not

4062
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Alright also Tigerclaw

4063
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
letting us know that a new side scrolling Teenage Mutant

4064
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Ninja Turtles game is coming in October

4065
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Activision

4066
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
talked about this in a press release it's based on the

4067
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Nickelodeon version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

4068
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
You know they're doing a new movie right? Yeah I knew that

4069
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
With Megan Fox

4070
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Yeah I heard about that

4071
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Pass

4072
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Also lastly Spazinator

4073
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
on Twitter wants to know after the

4074
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
show is over anyone up for a game

4075
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
of Left 4 Dead 2 or if not

4076
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Left 4 Dead 2 then Civ 4

4077
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I'm up for a game of driving home

4078
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Here's the thing well I would play Civ

4079
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
5 but not on Sunday night because I got to go

4080
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
to work tomorrow you got to catch me on the weekend

4081
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
and you got to book that shit in advance

4082
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
but yeah sadly

4083
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
I can't tonight because Alan and I have errands

4084
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
to run after the show but I will invite

4085
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
the other listeners if you want to play some Left 4

4086
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Dead 2 which is a game a lot of people own on Steam

4087
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
go meet

4088
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Raginator or Spazinator whatever he's called

4089
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
go meet him in our VOG Network group

4090
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
and get a game going he wants to

4091
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
kill some zombies with you have fun

4092
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Alright

4093
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
Well I guess that's going to do it for our Skype line tonight

4094
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
and I

4095
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
guess it's going to start to do it for the end of our show

4096
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
It's starting to get really hot in here you

4097
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
guys it's been a hot day in Sacramento

4098
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
and then we're running the oven right now because

4099
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
I guess Alan started dinner so it's like

4100
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I think it's time for us to wrap

4101
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
up and get on out of here so sorry it was a little bit

4102
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
shorter of a show tonight but we'll be back next week

4103
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
to do it all over again

4104
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Won't we? Yay

4105
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
I guess

4106
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
and you guys will hopefully be here too

4107
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
at live.vognetwork.com

4108
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
I guess

4109
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
But before we end the show we have to go around and give everybody's

4110
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
final thought

4111
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
DarkSakura your final thought tonight

4112
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Um

4113
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Words

4114
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Loki your final thought tonight

4115
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Uh

4116
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I wonder how long it's going to take me to get all those

4117
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
coming bears

4118
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
My final thought is

4119
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
I'm going to need to really convince myself

4120
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
not to buy Rogue Legacy

4121
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
while it's at least 20%

4122
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
off during the Steam sale and I was holding out

4123
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
for a deeper discount or

4124
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
else I'm probably going to end up buying that later tonight

4125
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
because I do want to get that I've heard a lot of good things about it

4126
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Damn it

4127
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Damn you Steam sale

4128
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
You should have gotten Little Inferno Damn you

4129
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Or do you have it? I still might you never know

4130
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000

Alright well
