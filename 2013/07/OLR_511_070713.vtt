Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, July 7th, 2013, two gaming companies find themselves hacked this week.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Xbox One reputation system matching hopes to group trolls with trolls.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
And we find out why the Wii Vitality sensor disappeared.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
It's Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 511 for July the 7th, 2013.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to join you over the next couple hours to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, all things gaming

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and as well as my co-host, one just one right now in studio.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Say hello to Loki, Techmaster Loki here tonight.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hello.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm doing fine.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah?

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
I, I, my decision to not get fries was, it paid off, I think.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes, you made a, you made a little fast food decision tonight, right?

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
Well, yeah, cause I normally go to like fast food and stuff and a lot of times, especially in the evenings and even sometimes during, you know, the lunch hours and stuff,

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
like you go to like McDonald's or something like that and their fries are good when, when they're good.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
But there's such a small margin of when they are able to make them good versus just being crap.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
And a lot of times, especially at dinner time, it's just, it's garbage.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
It's just not good at all.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
So I decided, hey, you know, instead of getting like a double quarter pounder meal large and that kind of stuff and paying like eight bucks,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
I just got two double cheeseburgers and no fries and just a large drink.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
And then that ended up being like three bucks and I'm just as full from it.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
So I think that's the way to go.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
There you go. Saving money, right?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Exactly.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
And then you don't have crappy, soggy french fries, but I'll tell you what's even worse.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Yes, we do talk about fast food occasionally on the show.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
You know what?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
It is what it is.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
It is part of the gamer lifestyle.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Well, if you want to believe, I mean, Mountain Dew and Doritos isn't exactly fast food, but, you know, you get the idea.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
But, okay, so the other, just the other day I go to Carl's Jr., which I don't think they have on the East Coast.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I think they call it Hardee's. It's really all the same thing, right?

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
So I go there and I get my meal and I get Alan's thing. He gets a combo with fries.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
I always get Chris cut fries with my sandwich because I love their Chris cut fries.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
They're the bomb.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
They're like, you know, they're even better than like the waffle fries and other chains and so forth.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Like, I love them.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
So I get the fries and I can, like, smell them in the bag.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm like, mmm, smells like french fries, right?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Smells so good.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I get all the way home, open the bag.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
They gave me regular fries instead of Chris cut fries.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Like, the one reason I go to Carl's Jr., denied.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
So mad.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
It's like you want to just drive back to the building and scream at somebody.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Some poor guy who made a mistake.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
But I'm just too lazy and I ate the fries anyway.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
What can you do?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
What can you do?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
All right.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Go to our chat room.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
The Voice of the Geeks Network.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Live.vognetwork.com.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Queen Simeon chat says, is that what Carl's Jr. is?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Yes, it's pretty much Hardee's.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Some people that have had both tell me they're different, but they're...

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I think they serve different things.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Like, their menu's slightly different.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
But it's pretty much the same.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
They were selling, like, Hardee's biscuits here at one point.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I don't know.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
It's interesting how all that stuff...

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Just put the same menu on there.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
It's not like people, like, on the East Coast eat so much different things than the people on the West Coast.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
It's not all that...

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
It's interesting how fast food really varies.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
It's not like, you know, we're in Hawaii where, you know, beef is not plentiful and there is a lot of spam.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
But, you know, it's just...

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
I don't understand why it has to be that different when you have a chain that's on both sides of...

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Well, and I don't understand why they just won't put In-N-Outs on the East Coast.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Because anytime I have a friend from about...

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
What's the furthest In-N-Out goes out?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I think Texas now.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
So anything further east than Texas, if they come out here to visit or whatever, it's like, we gotta go to In-N-Out.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
We gotta go have In-N-Out.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
It's a good fast food burger, don't get me wrong.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
But, you know, I'm like, God, why don't they open one up in New York already?

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
It's just wanting to get the franchise.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
They're just like, why do we have Dunkin' Donuts over here?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Amen to that.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
But, I mean, I don't know.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
There's a lot of reasons, I guess.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
It's just whether people want to franchise something like that far away.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I don't know. I thought it'd be kind of cool.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
People are always shocked when I tell them we don't have Dunkin' Donuts here.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
We do not have Dunkin' Donuts here, people.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Which sucks because I love their coffee.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
I would go there as opposed to Starbucks if I could, even though it's so terrible for you.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
It's so good. I can't help it.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Every time I travel, I have to get a Dunkin' Coffee. It's so good.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
And then I can't resist and have one of those coconut donuts, too.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Alright, it is a show about video games, and I'm sure you're all wondering,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
where is the lovely Dark Sakura? Why didn't you introduce her?

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Dark Sakura is running a little late tonight, so she will be here during the show

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
because it is about a three-hour show.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
We're anticipating her arrival in about an hour.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
The only bummer is that she was going to kick off the show with her talk about Atari Party,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
which is a local event here in Davis.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
And, bummer, I really wanted to go, but it conflicted with something else I have for

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
rehearsals for something coming up, so I couldn't go to Atari Party.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
But she went, Dan went, I think Dan is coming here with her.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
So they're going to talk about Atari and all the classic things that they saw this week,

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
which I love that stuff because Atari 2600 really was my first gaming system.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Even though I show Commodore 64 a lot of love on this show, and rightly so,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Atari 2600 really was my first gaming system.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Like, you know, I have very fond memories being five years old

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
and playing the Spider-Man Atari 2600 video game on my mom's TV,

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
which was just like this little dude that had a red top and blue tights to look like Spider-Man.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
You could shoot a web up and you climbed up a building, basically.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I remember there was something with the windows.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
There was either bad guys in windows or people you rescued in windows.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I don't remember. It's been so long since I played.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
But, yeah, I used to play that Spider-Man game.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Did you play Atari 2600 growing up?

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
No, I didn't have a 2600.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Well, my friends did, but I had a ColecoVision with an Atari adapter.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
So I had Atari games, but it wasn't necessarily playing through the Atari system.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
It was that weird adapter that they had.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I didn't even know they had an adapter.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, it was in that really awkward like,

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
hey, that's kind of infringing on our copyrights type thing, but who cares?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
I don't have anything to do with copyrights.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
I just play the game.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
You ever go back and play the old stuff now, like emulators and so forth?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
See, here's the weird thing for me.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
The weird thing about when I play this stuff on emulators is that

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
my gaming attention deficit disorder, which is totally a legit thing I have,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
gets even worse.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
You'll load up an emulated game and I'll play it for literally 15 seconds.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Then it says, oh, onto a new game, oh, onto a new game.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
It's like, I'm going to try everything at the buffet.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
But there's something different about doing that

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
versus going to sit and play at the TV and force yourself to sit there at the TV,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
even if it's, and I know this is really weird,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
even if it's emulated on the TV like Xbox Game Room.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Perfect example, right?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Loads of Atari 200 games on Xbox Game Room.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
But that shit can hold my attention for a lot longer.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
Like playing something like Stampede, which is a grossly simple game, right?

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
It's just like wrangle up the cows and don't let them get past the left side of the screen.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Like I could sit there and play that shit forever and keep trying to beat my high score and stuff,

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
but when I'm playing it in emulators, it's like, board now, switch, board now, switch.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
I remember we played the ColecoVision version of Smurfs

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
and we cycled through the whole game like about 20 times one time.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
It's just like, it just keeps going. It's funny.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Just this week on, or no, it wasn't this week, but a couple weeks ago on Virtual Console for Wii U,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Mario Brothers came out, and I'm not talking Super Mario Brothers.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
I mean, the original Mario Brothers, which was that one static screen with the pipes and the turtles and the crabs,

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
that was on Atari 2600, and we used to play the shit out of that.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
My best friend in like second grade and I would play that all the time.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Thanks to the DS, I'm so burnt out on that game.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I remember when Mario Brothers was just like,

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Hey, it comes with Mario Brothers, every single Mario game that's on the DS comes with Mario Brothers.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
You can play with your friends, you know, with the Game Share thing because it comes with Mario Brothers.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
It's like, dude, I don't need to play this game anymore.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
You put it on every single cartridge.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Bobby Blackwolf, our pal from his show that's on right before us here at VOG Network says,

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
Oink, I loved Oink. I loved that game too, but it's really only good to me as a two player game

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
because if I remember right, I don't remember if it was a really advertised feature,

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
but you could plug in a second joystick and the second person could be the big bad wolf.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
And it wasn't in all the Activision collections.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
Like it wasn't in some of the ones I remember picking up, but that was a great game on the 2600.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
Remember when Activision was like the best games on the system back in the 2600 days?

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Dungeon Buster says, H-E-R-O was also fun. That's one of my all time favorite 2600 games.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
I grew up on that with the Commodore 64 first, which has like really improved graphics.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
That game was kind of awesome.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
S-H-A-100 Matt says, See, I have gamer ADD, but I have a hard time with MMOs because of it.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I wonder how Rob is able to play MMOs with it.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
The social element of MMOs makes it a lot like you want to improve your character

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
so you can go on adventures with friends like you.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
The motivation of having friends to play with is huge.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Like I can sit there on MMO and be chatting on Skype and it's a much kind of different experience

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
than just kind of like a single player with emulators.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Does that make sense?

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
I have found lately a lot of my friends are leaving World of Warcraft.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Almost all of my co-hosts on Horde House have left Warcraft.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
The one that still plays, Grandpa, plays with his cousins or his family or something now

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
so he doesn't really play with me anymore.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I had a couple friends that were playing for a week.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
Not a lot of people I know are playing it anymore and it's sad because it really kills my motivation to play.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
And there's still a couple people that play and I have some friends in Canada that play

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
and I really like them and I like talking to them but they're the only ones anymore that are playing

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
and it makes it really hard to motivate myself to kind of get on and you don't want to do anything

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
because I'm like, eh, what am I doing?

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm doing a daily dungeon, pew pew, alliance is dead, wah, moving on to something else.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm falling behind on all these single player games because of the MMOs.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah, that's the thing. It's like there's all these other games and those MMOs take so much of your time

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
that it's just hard to justify wanting to play them.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, I bet they left WoW to play Marvel Heroes.

10:52.000 --> 11:00.000
Not my co-host on Horde House so much but Captain Spike I don't think would mind me outing him from Game Buoy.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
We were playing WoW and he's been playing Marvel Heroes a lot lately which we all played one night.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
It was a lot of fun and now Alan got Marvel Heroes too so I don't know.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
That is kind of a thing that's happening right now is Marvel Heroes but for how long?

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Until Final Fantasy XIV comes out in its full form I'm sure.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Because every beta weekend for Final Fantasy XIV has been kind of that.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
But even Final Fantasy XIV I kind of hit a wall with this week.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
I hit one of those single player, I know I'm getting into my gaming week a little bit but oh well.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
I hit one of those single player missions you have to do in Final Fantasy XIV and it was kind of like,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
I just kind of got frustrated with it and I was like, you know what?

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
I'm going to go play some single player games I need to catch up on because I have extensively beta tested this game.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I've given my feedback. What am I doing?

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
I'm getting frustrated over this quest where my character is just going to get wiped in a couple days anyway when the next beta phase begins.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
So I'm going to wait at this point for the non-erased character beta which is the next open beta.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
The characters you create in open beta will carry over to the live game.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
So I'm just waiting for that at this point.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
I, uh, that game man, I don't know.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
I was playing it yesterday and it's just one of those things like, you know, I leveled up to 11.

12:14.000 --> 12:21.000
And I've been basically soloing everything because I don't know how to party and everybody that we kind of talk to,

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
they're never on or I don't see them or I don't have them friended or something.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
And so it's like, well this is kind of okay I guess.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
And then at the same time I'm like, I don't know if I want to keep playing this because I know I'm not going to play this in the future.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
Then at the same time I'm like, well I kind of want to play it, but at the same time I don't want to play it.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Because there are all these good games that I want to come out, you know, Grand Theft Auto for sure.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
I mean, I want to play that more online than I want to play Final Fantasy.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
But, you know, I like Final Fantasy, it's just, I don't know, I'm torn.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
A lot of people talking, about one million people registered for Final Fantasy XIV beta.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
It's going to be very interesting to see how that goes over once the sub-fee is kicking.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
Because I think a lot of people are just playing it as a demo right now, but sub-fees means, you know, you got to pay up if you want to keep going.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
We'll see, it's going to be interesting.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Raginator in chat says, Rob Roberts, I'm probably in the minority here, but I always thought that Game Room was underappreciated.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I love it.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Raginator, have you heard the show? I was a huge proponent of Game Room. I loved it.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
I was, I'm actually like legit pissed off that Microsoft really dropped the ball with it.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
And, you know, they let everybody go at Chrome and all that stuff.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Like, it actually pissed me off that they were out there promising thousands of games and nothing ever came of that.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Because Game Room, Game Room did what Virtual Console needs to do.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
I realized when it came to setting up your little rooms and so forth, that that feature was a little bit gimped.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
But whatever, when it came to the game playing itself, the live leaderboards was great.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
The replays was great.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Being able to send challenges to your friends was great.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
Like, that's all stuff that Nintendo's Virtual Console would greatly benefit from and would have a great enhanced value from.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
And it's a great way to modernize classic games.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
And I realized there's purists out there that are like, you know what, nothing matches the old school.

14:16.000 --> 14:23.000
Get my Atari 2600 with its coaxial cable to a TV that won't even get channels anymore because of the digital switch.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
And I totally respect that.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
And that's totally part of the point of a thing like Atari Party is for like-minded people to get together and play that stuff, I'm sure.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Or at least Jamie can give us insight to that later.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
But I liked Game Room as a modern experience of classic games.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
And I'm really pissed that Microsoft didn't try to invest a little more into it.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
I can't imagine it was this horrific expense.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Like, they weren't writing new games.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
Now, granted, they were probably having to go back and tweak an awful lot to get them to work and so forth.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
But really, were they just not selling anything?

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Then, I don't know, maybe there's other questions you need to ask yourself.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
But yeah, I was a huge proponent of Game Room.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
And I'm pissed it didn't work.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
And I'm pissed we probably won't get anything like it on Xbox One.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Or anything. You know? It sucks.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
I'm surprised we haven't seen PlayStation Home on the PlayStation 4.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
Like, I would have thought that would have been kind of cool to step up everything.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
Or maybe they just didn't really work out, I guess.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
They didn't do what they wanted to do with it.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
Well, PlayStation Home definitely has its cult...

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm not saying that in a negative context. Like a cult movie.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
PlayStation Home has its cult following.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
And we've had some of that on this show.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
We participated with one of the home events.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
It was a lot of fun to see that community.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
You're right. It is weird that they didn't mention that going to the PlayStation 4.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
I don't know if... I would have thought it was profitable enough with the microtransactions and everything.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
It was basically Second Life on a console and it seemed to be doing well enough in itself.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
But do you think that maybe they could...

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Well, I guess not because of the chipset.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
I was thinking in my mind, could they just carry PlayStation Home over to PlayStation 4?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
But I guess not for the same reason it's not backwards compatible.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
They changed the core chipset.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah, maybe streaming. Who knows?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Alright, well anyhow.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
That was a very random potpourri sort of kickoff topic.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
But let's talk about the video games that we've actually been playing this week.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Besides just Final Fantasy XIV, apparently.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Final Fantasy XIV. Unfortunately, that's all that I played this week.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
Just... I only played a few hours of it, actually.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Just the other day, just leveling my Thaumaturge.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
And I kept trying to solo stuff.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
It's so really weird how you can party but not party.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
People can help you.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
If you're fighting something, someone else can join in and fight the same monster.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And you still get the experience from it.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Even though you're not partying.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Which is odd. I don't know why they have that.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
But it's neat.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
It is a little frustrating.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
There was a monster chasing somebody and I was trying to pull it off of them.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
And the monster was invulnerable.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
And it got in this weird loop where he would run towards me and then run away.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
And then he'd run back towards me and then run away.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
And kind of kept going that way back and forth.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I guess that was a bug or something.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, it's a beta. It might have been a bug.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
But I've seen the invulnerable thing happen.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Like when the person who pulled it loses all the threat.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Like they run out of range or whatever.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
The mob retreats and during that time it's invincible.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Same thing happens in WoW actually.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
It'll evade in WoW.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
It's kind of nice.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
The only thing I don't like about that though is I'll try to pull a mob.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
And then try to use the landscape at my advantage.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
And it wasn't even that far away.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I was on a bridge and I was trying to attack fish.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
And the fish couldn't figure out how to turn the corner to the bridge or something.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And so it kept going invulnerable.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
And I couldn't do any damage to it even though I was well within range.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
It's just stupid I guess.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I don't know. It was kind of annoying.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Did you play around with any of the crafting professions?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
No.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I did a little bit of that this week.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
That's interesting.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
It's different.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
It's not just put the pieces together and craft.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
There's a little bit of strategy that comes into play on will you get a high quality item or not.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
How does that work?

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Your item as you craft it has durability.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
And so let's say you'll get four attempts.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
You can do four moves on it.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
And you can either craft and it might take two of your attempts to craft it.

18:42.000 --> 18:51.000
But as you level in a profession you'll get things that are like you get a 70% chance to enhance the percentage of possibility it will be a high quality item.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
Or you get a move that will restore all of the durability but at great cost.

18:56.000 --> 19:04.000
It's just interesting. All your abilities become part of the balancing game of trying to craft the item without breaking it and losing all your stuff.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
It's not just throw them all together and click craft.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I like that they changed it up a little.

19:09.000 --> 19:19.000
Yeah I was just basically doing the regular quests in the game and then just grinding I guess.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I mean that's really all I could do.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
I went back into town to get some more quests because the storyline doesn't seem to be progressing.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Because I'm not sure maybe I'm just not doing something right.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Let's be honest I'm not really reading any of the story either.

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
I'm just skipping through all of it because if they really want me to pay attention to something they'll have a cutscene.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
It ends up happening usually.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I still know what the story is and I don't really care.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I just want to get to a point where...

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I don't know if it's just in the beta.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
I guess if you get to a certain point where you're level 20 you can actually level all your other subs to 15.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
That'll only be in the beta but yes.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
And probably not carrying over to open beta.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Oh well.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
But once you get to level 15 they did finally implement the duty finder.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Not duty finder but duty finder.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Which basically they're looking for group tool.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
So you can do dungeons and that fun stuff.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Which wasn't really a thing in Final Fantasy XI.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
But that's a huge wow thing obviously.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I haven't really explored too far either.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
I've just been around the town so I don't know how to get anywhere.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Oh yeah you gotta get out there and explore.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Well everything's trying to kill me.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Keep doing story quests and around level 15 you get an airship pass.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And you go to the other towns as part of a quest.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
It's pretty cool.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Alright well if that's it for your gaming week.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
I'll talk about my gaming week a little bit besides Final Fantasy XIV.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
I kind of just needed a break from MMOs this week.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
I played Final Fantasy XIV extensively on Friday and Saturday.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But then I needed a break.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
So I played some other stuff.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
On Wii U Virtual Console I played Mario Brothers as I talked about before.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
I also played Pilot Wings because that came out on Virtual Console on July 4th.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
And who did not love the game that was made basically to show off Mode 7.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And it was a great game.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Who doesn't love Rocket Bell?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
What is it called? Rocket Pack? Rocket Bell?

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
That's a lot of fun to play as skydiving and all that stuff.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
And making the characters really angry or upset when you do really bad.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
But yeah the Mode 7 is fun.

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
One thing that at least the Wii U Virtual Console does that the Wii Virtual Console didn't do.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Is that you can take the screenshots and post them to Miiverse.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
And now as of like the end of June you can post those Miiverse posts to Twitter and stuff.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
So I've been doing that a little bit at my Twitter.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
If I can talk. Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E is my Twitter. Sky. S-K-I-E.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
And I've been posting some random things.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Like I posted a funny picture of one of the Pilot Wings people getting mad at me.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
And like this funny thing I did in Mario Brothers where I had two of the turtles facing each other.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
So it looked like they were talking to each other.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I like being able to post the screenshots to Miiverse.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
So if you want to follow me on Nintendo Network.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I'm Rob Roberts on Nintendo Network.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
I will post more hilarity when I can. When I'm feeling funny.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
So I've been doing that on Nintendo.

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
Otherwise on PC I suddenly got unexplainably addicted to Steam trading cards.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
I don't know why. I don't have a good reason for it.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
I just said this is something I want.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
You mean I can get silly loot like new backgrounds and experience that means nothing.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
And possibly coupons. I guess that's something.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
From doing this trading card game. Metagame in Steam.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Yes I must do this.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
So here's the thing though.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
The game kind of makes no sense when you hear it at first.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So let me explain it for you.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Best I can. Best I know about it.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
First off. First things first. You have to get this out of your head.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Trading cards are not tied to achievements.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Achievements have nothing to do with trading cards. They are separate.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
So get that out of your head. Break that link.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
First mistake people make. They think the two are tied together. They're not. Completely separate.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
So certain games have trading cards.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
And there might be five in a set. There might be nine in a set. There might be seven.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
There's anywhere from five to nine it looks like from the games I've played.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
Now there's two different systems in a game that you paid for.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Like Super Meat Boy.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Magica.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Binding of Isaac.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
In a game that you paid for. Every time you start the game.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
And play it for about twenty, thirty minutes.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
And log out. You get a trading card.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
Up to half the number that are in the deck.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
In other words.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
Super Meat Boy is probably one of the smallest decks that has five cards in it.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
You can get three of them by playing Super Meat Boy.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Once you've gotten all the cards. You can get repeats though which sucks.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
In Faerie Solitaire I've gotten three of the same card which is really irritating.

23:48.000 --> 23:54.000
But. And you don't. Like if you are only eligible. I think I'm eligible for five out of nine in Faerie Solitaire.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
Except three of my five are all the same. So I'm going to have to do some big time trading.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
So what happens once you get half?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
You become eligible for booster packs.

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
Which are handed out. This is the part I don't quite have figured out yet. Maybe somebody in chat can help.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
It seems to be arbitrary.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Like you might get them in a day. You might get them in a week.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
But you have to log into Steam every week in order to be eligible for the booster packs.

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
And my understanding is that booster packs spawn as people complete their sets.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
And you have a greater chance to get a booster pack if your Steam experience is higher.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Like your Steam level 10. Your Steam level 20. Which you can get from the games you own.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
The previous sales. And all this other stuff.

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
So once you get the booster packs then you open them up and maybe you'll finish your set through a booster pack.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
Which then you can combine your set and tada! You get your badge and you get a new profile background.

24:47.000 --> 24:53.000
A new emote icon. Just a bunch of really cosmetic stuff.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
But still kind of a little more than what achievements get you, right?

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
And possibly a coupon. Like I saw one YouTube where a guy opened it up and he got a 50% off Company Heroes or something.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
One of those games coupon. Which I thought, oh that's cool because that's more trading fodder later.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Like I could use that to trade for a card. Like I'm never going to buy this game.

25:10.000 --> 25:16.000
Why don't you give me your Super Meat Boy card and I'll give you my 50% off coupon for this game.

25:16.000 --> 25:24.000
So Steam's created this very interesting thing about it. I kind of wish there was a little more to it than just the play the game.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
Oh! I missed free to play. For games like Dota, Team Fortress, you don't get the cards for playing.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
You get the cards for spending money in the online shop.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Like for every, I think it's $9 or $10 you spend in the shop, you get a card.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
So I'm not so focused on those because I don't really play any of those.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
The only free to play game I play through Steam regularly right now is Marvel Heroes and they don't have cards.

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
But I've been going back, you know, I've got over 100 Steam games thanks to these bundles and bundles I accumulated in Steam sales.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Oh my god! Steam sale coming!

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah, a lot of the old stuff.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
ActDeft correcting me in chat saying you can only get them once per week.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
I did not know that.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
And ActDeft says you can also buy cards and boosters from the Steam Community Marketplace.

26:08.000 --> 26:14.000
Oh boy, see? They've created this whole game where you're spending money to get that one card.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I'm going to try not to go that route. I'm going to really try to do this the old-fashioned way.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I haven't gotten any booster packs yet because I just got into it this weekend.

26:20.000 --> 26:29.000
But I've collected like, I have three Super Meat Boy cards, three Really Big Sky cards, three Faerie Solitaire cards, one Magica card.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
And that'll tell you what else I've been playing with my gaming week.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
So let me quickly run down some of these other games.

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
Super Meat Boy. Plug in a controller and use it on the PC. It's just as fun as the Xbox 360 version and it's still fun to play.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
That's a great game to play for a few minutes.

26:44.000 --> 26:51.000
You play a few minutes, beat a few rounds, you feel accomplished, get frustrated on a level, whatever, close it, come back later.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
Really Big Sky is a twin-stick shooter that came out I think at the end of last year.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
I like it but it's not my favorite twin-stick shooter.

27:00.000 --> 27:07.000
And part of the reason I don't like it is that, well for one, I get really bad performance issues when there's too much stuff on screen on my PC.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
I probably need to play with the graphics settings and so forth.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
But I think it starts to become too much.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
Like the graphics are just too much and I can't tell things apart and it just looks like explosion mania.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
And I really didn't like how retro mode was just this really silly filter and a chiptune song.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Like it was not retro mode at all. I did not like that.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
But those are really the only, I know I'm sounding very negative about this game but it is a fun game especially if you like shooters.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
And the soundtrack is phenomenal. I really like that.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
Also been playing The Binding of Isaac which is kind of rogue.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
A lot of people say it's Legend of Zelda but it doesn't play like Zelda.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
It plays like a twin-stick shooter.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
But it's always randomly generated which is interesting.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
It's a little bit out there as far as the story goes.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
And it's one of those things you're like, you play it and you're like, you know, not all games are art.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Cause this one's a little weird.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
You got like monsters that leave poop everywhere that's part of a mechanic.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
And you find these really odd things that you're, cause you know the plot of the story is that your mom is trying to kill you.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
That's the plot of The Binding of Isaac.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And you find all this really weird stuff.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
It's kind of a creepy game. I'm only playing that as much as I have to to get cards.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
I like the idea of a roguelike that does the randomly generated stuff. There's a ton of those games out there.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
And then Magica. I like that.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
That's kind of like a puzzle-y type game where you can combine different magics together to get to.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
It reminds me of an old school PC game from like the late 90's.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
Where you, you know, you put things together to get to pass this part of a level.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
Like you might mix fire and stone magic together to throw a fire boulder.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Or you use ice magic to freeze a lake.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
And make all these clever spells.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And it's got a co-op mode that's supposedly a lot of fun.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
But I haven't really played a lot of the co-op mode.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
So, anyhow.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I've been talking to your ear off about Steam and all that.

29:04.000 --> 29:13.000
But the trading card thing is, I like that it gives me reason to go back and play these games that I probably didn't sink enough time into.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Like I played Binding of Isaac before.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
But I didn't play it enough to understand just how fucking disturbed it is, you know?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Now I understand a little better.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
And same thing with Magica and Fairy Solitaire and some of that.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
You know, I played enough Fairy Solitaire to get the game.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
But now I've really gotten to parts where it starts to just really get irritatingly difficult.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
So, there you go. That's been my time with Steam this week.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
AlphaCananagram in chat in reference to the Binding of Isaac says,

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
I only heard it is just like it is Zelda due to the dungeon format.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Yeah, and the bombs and the keys.

29:45.000 --> 29:53.000
But honestly, the way it plays as a game is a little more similar to Rogue and like a twin-stick shooter.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Even though you can only shoot in the four directions.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
But weird things happen. Like you'll find these pills.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
And you won't know what the pills do until you try using them once.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm almost positive that was a mechanic in Rogue.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
You didn't know what stuff did until you used it for once.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
And some of the pills will give you just derpy face.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
And it goes, I found a pill and I ate it.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Some will teleport you to a random room. Some will enhance your health.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
One of them is a suicide pill.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
You take it, you die. Game over. One life. That's it.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Game over, you start again from the beginning.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
That's like some Dark Souls level difficulty.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
Alright, let's move on.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Housekeeping. Don't forget to visit us on Twitter.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. And we are also on Facebook, of course.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
At Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Just got a text from DarkSakura. She's on her way.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
So we'll hopefully be seeing her in about 20 more minutes.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
But in the meantime, we're going to keep on moving with the show.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
And get into gaming news tonight.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Loki, start us off with one I'm sure you've all heard.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Don Mattrick has left Xbox.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
He was originally the president of the...

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
I believe their entertainment business division.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
And now he is going to become the president of Zynga.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
So that's interesting, I guess.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I'm not really sure why he did...

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
I mean, I can think of a few reasons why he might have done that.

31:19.000 --> 31:31.000
But the kind of general consensus out there is that he's jumping from a sinking ship to a ship that's on fire and in the water somehow.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
I think I saw that exact comic strip you're referencing.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
Yeah, it was a ship on fire and a ship being eaten by a shark or something.

31:39.000 --> 31:48.000
I don't want to sound like a know-it-all, but I can't resist in bringing up the fact that just two weeks ago on this show, after the big E3 thing, what did I say about Don Mattrick?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
What did I say, Loki? You remember?

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
You said that he was going to be on the chopping block, I guess.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
I said he would take the fall and he'd be gone within 365 days.

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
And just like the Xbox reversal thing, which happened in like three days, the Don Mattrick thing happened a lot faster than anticipated.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
But here's the kicker. I actually don't think he was forced out the door.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
No, I don't think so.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But I think Don Mattrick, I mean, he's the executive of a...

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Oh, he's now the CEO of a large company, whether you like it or not.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
It at one time was a profitable company.

32:17.000 --> 32:26.000
I think he saw what happened at E3, he saw what everybody was talking about, he saw this opportunity, and he took it.

32:26.000 --> 32:35.000
And I think it was one of those things where it's like, you know, if the Xbox One doesn't do well this holiday season, do I want to be left with no job?

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
Or do I take this job where maybe I can actually turn things around?

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
It is a heck of an opportunity and it could be a great way for him anyway to repair his image.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I mean, let's imagine he does turn Zynga around.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
And I know a lot of people are ready to pile poop on this.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
They're like, yay, poopy executive meets poopy company.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Go live in your poopy world together making poopville.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
But I don't know if I really see it that way because these are two...

33:04.000 --> 33:10.000
You've got a company in a pretty bad situation, you've got an executive that was in a pretty bad situation.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Maybe they can help each other more than they can hurt each other.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
And maybe this actually won't end up being the end of the world.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I mean, why do we hate on Zynga?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Why have we hated on Zynga in the past?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
What are people's complaints with Zynga?

33:22.000 --> 33:30.000
They seem to skirt around IP rights by mimicking as much as they can of a game without outright copy.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
I mean, they need sometimes outright copy, but they change enough to where they can't get sued, I guess.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Or they can't get sued and lose.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
They'll change things around slightly, but they'll keep...

33:41.000 --> 33:49.000
Because you can't copyright those core mechanics, so let's just rip them all out and take a popular game and make a clone of it.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
And then people will play because it's got Zynga on it.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Now, let me ask you this question.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
What does it take to change a company that's heading in that direction?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
What does that take?

34:02.000 --> 34:10.000
Well, it's not just that. They've had problems where they were buying up other companies and they're spending a lot of money doing that and they weren't making their money back.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Okay. What will it take to change that?

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Someone with good business sense.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
A new executive. New blood. A big change. A big change.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
And that's what Zynga's got, is they've got a big change.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
So now I think Don Mattrick and Zynga are really in a position to help each other.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
We can speculate to the cows come home what that's going to mean.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
And I know a lot of people joke, her perp is always online. Her perp one meets another.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
Don Mattrick did not come up with always online all by his lonesome self, y'all.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
But maybe there's some interesting stuff that could come of this. I don't know.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
Like, maybe Zynga will separate itself from Facebook a little bit.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
That's the part that's exciting to me. At least Don Mattrick wasn't from Facebook.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
Maybe Zynga will start to appear on consoles with games that aren't ripoffs of other stuff.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Like some casually interesting things.

35:01.000 --> 35:07.000
I think one of the things you're going to see with the Xbox One, and that's the whole reason why they have that Windows 8 section of the OS,

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
is that you're going to see all these apps that are being developed to run on Windows 8 are going to be able to run on the Xbox One.

35:14.000 --> 35:24.000
So if they have, say, a Farmville app that runs on Windows 8, I'm not sure if it's going to be just necessarily the RT or if it's just the actual x86 Windows 8,

35:25.000 --> 35:32.000
that these will probably be easily ported if not able to run natively on the Xbox One.

35:32.000 --> 35:41.000
So you could see these casual games coming to a game console, that and any other sort of app that people make.

35:41.000 --> 35:47.000
And that, very well, that may be why they're not really pushing the whole self-publishing thing because they're like,

35:47.000 --> 35:54.000
well, you published on Windows 8 on that marketplace and then you can publish on the Xbox One as well.

35:54.000 --> 36:04.000
And that's how they'll try to get people to make more apps for Windows 8 because they need apps on that marketplace in order to make Windows 8 seem appealing.

36:04.000 --> 36:11.000
Because kind of like what they have with the App Store on Mac, they need to have the content there in order to drive it.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.000
Rama says, I don't hate Zynga. All they're doing is playing the business game like a boss.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
ShadowNextGen says, Rob, Matric's image isn't tarnished except for the internet vocal minority.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
When it was announced that Matric was joining Zynga, Zynga's stock jumped up.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
I think you're minimalizing the negativity that came out of E3 a little bit.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
Now, how much of that is tied to Matric versus not? That could be argued a little bit.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
I don't think you can blame one person for the whole Xbox stuff anyway.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
I don't, but again, like I said two weeks ago, someone's going to take the fall for it.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.000
I don't know if anyone's taken the fall yet for it. He may have just jumped ship.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
I was going to mention, though, that they're going to have...

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Well, I want to say the second half of this comment here.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
When it was announced that Matric was joining Zynga, Zynga's stock jumped up.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Well, exactly. How can things get worse at Zynga?

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
And let's not belittle that Don Matric did have a lot of success at Microsoft.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Xbox 360's done very well.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
So, I think a lot of people see it as, you know, this can only help things.

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
Sure, maybe he had a bad week, but at the end of the day, Zynga's in the shitter.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
And maybe Don Matric can help bring them out of that at least.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
And that would be a great thing. And sure, sure, I think a lot of investors saw that too.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
Hey, you know, if Zynga's looking to get some games on the Xbox One or something,

37:37.000 --> 37:44.000
it might help to have somebody that used to be working for Microsoft to kind of build those bridges.

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
There were gonna... One other thing, I guess, Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft,

37:50.000 --> 37:59.000
he's considering, I guess, Julie Larson-Green, who is, I guess, the current Windows CEO or whatever

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
to take over the Xbox division.

38:03.000 --> 38:10.000
So, when she's quite experienced, I guess, she did product launches for Windows 7

38:10.000 --> 38:17.000
and helped design some of the user interface stuff for the Office products.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
Not the newer ones, but 2003, 2007, which I thought were sane.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
And then 2010 came around, it's like, what the fuck is this?

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
So, yeah, I'll be interested in seeing how that affects anything.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
I don't think... A lot of these people in these positions, I don't think have a lot...

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Because it seems like it doesn't change too much.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
Like, you get a new CEO, all of a sudden it's not radically different.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
It's just... I don't know, we'll see.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
They have a game plan, they're sticking to it, so...

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says,

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
Larson-Green headed up the Windows 8 group after the last head left.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Well, when did the last head leave?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
See, I haven't been following the Windows 8 drums.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
I just know that the launch of Windows 8, not so great,

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
but they really seem to be making things right with this 8.1 patch,

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
and it seems a lot more exciting this time than the original launch of Windows 8.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
It seems like they've got, like...

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
It's like they get this market research or something about what people want,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
and then they make it that way, but they don't...

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
It's like they don't quite get it 100%.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It's like, people want tablets.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
Let's make an OS for tablets and put it on a PC.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
It's like, uh-huh?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Tigerclaw in our chat says,

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
Who do you think should replace Don Mattrick when going up on stage

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
at next year's E3 press conference?

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
Well, I mean, if this rumbling is true, it would be Julie Larson-Green,

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
which, you know, I don't know much about this particular executive,

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
I have to say, but however, you know, silly this might sound...

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Steve Ballmer.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Well, it could be Steve Ballmer, but I...

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
He yells a lot.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
I like the girl power that Microsoft's showing a little bit here, you know?

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
I think it would be a great thing for a female to be taking the lead on this,

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
especially, you know, after there were some very shameful things

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
that came out of Microsoft's press conference,

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
whether it was intended or not, it was shameful.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
I think that would be...

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
I mean, Microsoft's got this executive possibly coming in.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
The one that used to work for CBS

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
is now the head of the Microsoft Entertainment Group.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
The head of 343 Studios is female.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I think that's great.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I'm all for that type of diversity.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
So, you know, at least there's that,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
is it will bring a little more diversity,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
but I don't know this gal's credentials

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
or what else she brings to the table outside of that.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
But I think we'll be learning a lot more about her

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
if it's true that she is going to be taking over Microsoft's entertainment division.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
We'll see.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
So, all right.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Anyhow, I guess we'll move on with news, yes?

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Yes.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Moving on to a story about Xbox One,

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
and since we've been talking a lot about Windows 8,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
and I guess if they're bringing in the Windows 8 executive,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
this might make a lot of sense here.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
Microsoft Builds Developers Conference last week

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
talked about what could be Xbox One compatibility for Windows 8 apps,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
and I think you were mentioning this a little bit too, Loki.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
Yeah, I completely didn't realize.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
I actually listened to part of the Build thing, too.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
There was some news out of it that was kind of exciting, but...

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Well, let me read at least some of the quotes here

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
when we can further talk about this here.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
Steve Guggenheimer, who is the VP of Developer and Platform Evangelism,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I don't know if that's a word this website used.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I can't imagine that's a title,

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
but he talked about how folks that would like to start on Xbox One development

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
should start on Windows 8 applications because, quote,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Xbox One has two engines.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
It's got a gaming engine, and it essentially has a Windows 8 engine.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
And then he showed a web application that was running on Xbox One.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Nothing to announce today,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
but when I talk about that common core,

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
you're seeing that common core in action being able to target other devices

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
over time that run the Windows 8 engine.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Hmm.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Yeah, and I already kind of...

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
They sort of alluded to that anyways

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
when they were talking about how their OS is set up,

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
how it's three OSes basically on top of each other.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
You have the Windows 8 OS, the Xbox One OS,

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
and then the one that kind of makes them talk to each other, I guess.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
The arbitrator OS.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Black Wolf corrects me in chat saying,

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
yes, it is an actual Microsoft title.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Strange, but okay.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I mean, it makes sense. I get it.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
I just, you know, when I think of evangelists,

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
I think of the guys on, you know, PTL on television.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
One of the things that was kind of exciting,

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
because now you know how they don't have really X and A anymore.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
It's kind of gone by the wayside.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
They did announce a partnership with Unity

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
where they're going to be allowing porting

42:43.000 --> 42:49.000
where you can make Xbox One games with Unity.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
That's going to have that built-in support as well,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
so that's kind of cool.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
And I think they're going to have PlayStation 4 support as well,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
so that's kind of...

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I don't know if it's necessarily replacing X and A,

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
but that may be the new route to go, I guess.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
Yeah, I was going to say, how useful is it

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
for Windows 8 apps to be on Xbox One when you can't self-publish?

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
But that's the thing, is they may have that,

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
where it's going to have access to the App Store that's on PC,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
but they're going to say,

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
well, you can't publish a game on Xbox One,

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
but you can publish an app on the App Store

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
and have access to Xbox One,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
or the Xbox One users will have access to it.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Maybe that's how they're going to get around it.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
You know, when I'm thinking to myself,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I'm like, what types of apps could we be talking about here?

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Are we talking about things like calendar management apps on Xbox One?

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Like anything.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
Because when I think of apps, like on 360,

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
outside of games, they have a lot of web video players.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
It seems like everything is some type of video player.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
I can't think of a whole lot of stuff on 360

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
that's not some type of video player for some network or some website.

43:58.000 --> 44:03.000
I have this weird feeling that that's somehow going to be

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
some sort of entry point for hacking right there,

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
allowing these applications that can be run on the App Store.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Because I can think of someone

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
that could somehow sneak something in there.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Oh, yeah, something that gets stealthily loaded,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
like how MAME got on the Apple Store.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
They loaded it as one of the freeware ROMs.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
I think it was called Gridly or something was the game.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
It's an arcade game that went freeware.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
People released it a long time ago.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
So they put that app on the marketplace.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
Well, hidden underneath it was a MAME emulator.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
And as long as you could get it from the Apple Store

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
in the window before they caught it,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
all you have to do is use one of those programs

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
that let you browse the file structure on your phone.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
You just throw ROMs in the directory.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
You got MAME on your iPad and iPhone,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
which works great with that little iCade I have sitting over there,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
just for the record.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Tigerclaw in chat says,

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
like, how about a VOG app for Xbox One?

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
I'm sure Bobby is wincing, kind of thinking about all the work

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
it would take to make something like that.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Loki is learning how to program.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Maybe he can take that project.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Well, here's the thing. I don't think that's necessary anymore

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
because nowadays, let's hope that their Internet Explorer

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
has HTML5 support.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
It should be able to support the website natively.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
You'd be able to just use the website.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
So it's not necessary to create a dedicated app for that stuff anymore

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
because browsers are smart enough now

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
to where they can run all that content.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
You know, before, they couldn't, so you had to build some.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Gameguru in chat says,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Unity is going to be the indie platform.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
We shall see.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I've been hearing a lot of good things about it, though.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, golf.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Let's move on.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I guess I'll do this story here.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Jamie was going to talk about this,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
but she's still a few minutes away, it sounds like.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I will cover this here.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
It's a game called...

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Is it Ittle-Doo?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
It's Ittle-Doo.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
That'll do, kid.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Ittle-Doo. I-T-T-L-E-Doo.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
Ittle-Doo is now out on the PC.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
Ittle-Doo, they say, is a kind of Zelda-esque adventure title.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
It's very cartoony.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
It's by Swedish studio Ludosity.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
It sells for 9.40 euros.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
That's $13.99.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
It's kind of like Zelda, but it has its own cartoon aesthetic,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
and it has a lot of self-referential humor.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Oh, I like the games that break down the fourth wall.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
That's always a lot of fun.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
It pokes fun at itself as your little shipwrecked character

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
and her flying fox, Tipsy,

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
go around terrorizing the island's inhabitants

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
and stealing their wealth and eating their hearts.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
That doesn't sound very good unless we're talking, like, flashy hearts like Zelda.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
Well, Ittle-Doo will also be on Mac and Steam and Wii U,

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
Linux, iPad, and Android later this year.

47:06.000 --> 47:11.000
If you get it now, you'll get the Steam, Mac, and Linux ports on their release.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
And Ouya.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Oh, and Ouya.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I wasn't hearing the story, but...

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
Oh, I see. It's on Twitter and it's in review right now.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Very cool.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
They review games that go on the Ouya?

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
That's news.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
I don't know what it says.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
Probably before it goes on the official marketplace, I would think so.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Yeah, that's good enough.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
If you want to see some of the games,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
there are some Let's Plays available on YouTube

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
if you want to see the game in action.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Sounds cute.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I would like to check it out, especially if there's a little demo,

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
I can get a sample of it,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
but I guess there's always a Let's Play if nothing else.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
You can kind of check out a little bit about what that game's about.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Jamie must have earmarked that

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
because that's something she's taken interest in,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
so we'll ask her when she gets here.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
But for now, let's move on.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
So, Ubisoft got hacked.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Uh oh.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Yeah.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
So, you know, apparently an unnamed Ubisoft website,

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
they were hacked,

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
and the usernames, email addresses, and password information

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
have all been compromised.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
Thankfully, there's no sort of payment data in there,

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
but still, you know, you share passwords with Uplay or something like that,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
you may want to change them.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
So, they didn't say that they...

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
It says the tag did not originate via any Uplay services.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
The intrusion targets some of our internal online systems,

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
and I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but whatever.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
All the more reason why I don't like, you know,

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
signing up for these different services.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Although, I guess now I'm going to have to sign up for Origin

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
if I want to play Battlefield 3 now, aren't I?

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Ugh.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I mean, well, on PS3, I think, right?

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
Because you have to do that for Mass Effect, right?

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Yeah, you have to do it for Mass Effect.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
God damn it.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Well, whatever.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
I think I still have an old EA account that's probably out there anyways.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
It just sucks that you have to have all these different passwords,

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
and I know there's app solutions and password wallets and things,

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
but I'm going to be honest,

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
and maybe I shouldn't be saying this in my public radio show, but whatever.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
I kind of have a pool of different passwords I pick from.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
My bank account has one password that is very hard.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
It's just the most secure type of password.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
You can't figure it out, and I don't use it for anything else.

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
But sites like Uplay or signing up for random web forum here or there,

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
especially if there's no finances tied to it,

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
I use one password for pretty much all that stuff.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
It's like whatever.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
No big deal if you lose it.

49:34.000 --> 49:41.000
Oh no, someone's going to take over my account on Minecraft forum or something.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
Pretty much anything that could potentially have my credit card information on it,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I have to basically do a unique password for.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
But I have my own little system.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
I don't want to say much more than that, but I have a system doing unique passwords.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
Well, it may not affect most of our listeners.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
Club Nintendo Japan also was hacked.

49:58.000 --> 50:09.000
I guess they realized that there was a bunch of failed login attempts or something like that,

50:09.000 --> 50:17.000
and then they said that just under 24,000 illegitimate logins between June 9th and July 4th

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
from over 15 million attempts.

50:20.000 --> 50:26.000
So basically said that some of the information compromised in the attack

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
included full names, phone numbers, home email addresses,

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
and since they don't hold any credit card information, none of that was leaked.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
But still, it sucks.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
Still, names and addresses always kind of sucks.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
You never know what's going to happen.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
I mean, I have my credit card around there.

50:43.000 --> 50:49.000
They get enough stuff to mine enough information, they can create their own credit cards.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Usually they have to get your social for that.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Well, at least here in the States, they have to get your social for that.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
But still, scary.

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
All right, well, moving on, since you talked about Nintendo Japan,

51:01.000 --> 51:07.000
one item that's been getting a lot of passion lately is the region locking that's on Nintendo's console.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
And you know, it's not something that apparently is going to exist on Xbox One or PlayStation 4,

51:12.000 --> 51:18.000
which leaves the Wii U kind of the sole holdout when it comes to region locking.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
And I think we talked last week or the week before about there was a petition going around

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
to try and get Nintendo to reverse course on that and open up their system.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
Well, I don't want to say that Nintendo necessarily responded to it this week,

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
but there has been more context that's come out about region locking

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
that's making the rounds on the sites this week.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
And it was an interview with Satoru Iwata, and I believe this was run in IGN,

51:41.000 --> 51:48.000
saying that, quote, from some people's perspectives, the region lock might seem like a kind of restriction.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
But each region has its own cultural acceptance and legal restrictions, as well as different age ratings.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
There are always things that we're required to do in each different region,

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
which may go counter to the idea that players around the world want the freedom to play whatever they want.

52:02.000 --> 52:09.000
Continuing the quote here, I hope the game fans can understand that the industry isn't doing this solely out of business ego.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
There are some reasons behind it.

52:12.000 --> 52:22.000
Yeah, but I don't think your average mom is going to accidentally import a Japanese copy of some game or something like that.

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
Oh my God, content that's not appropriate for over here is on that game.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Oh no, that's not going to happen.

52:29.000 --> 52:36.000
It's going to be dedicated fans that know what they want to play are going to pay the fees to import a game to get it over here.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I don't know, I don't see the problem.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
Considering it's not a problem for the other consoles, why should it be a problem for this console?

52:42.000 --> 52:49.000
I think the hard thing about this too is that I get the whole business ego thing and you have your reasons for doing it,

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
but you look really silly when your peers aren't doing it.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
That's the problem.

52:53.000 --> 52:59.000
If Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft were all banded together doing the same thing, this probably wouldn't be an issue in the first place.

52:59.000 --> 53:05.000
Also, I think that they're trying to keep the purity of their marketplace the way it is,

53:05.000 --> 53:13.000
because they're known for being more of a wholesome console versus the other systems that have a lot of violent games on there.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
So maybe that's the reason is that they want to make sure that, hey, we may have some stuff that comes out in Japan

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
that has maybe a little bit more nudity in it than, say, a version that comes out over here.

53:26.000 --> 53:31.000
Maybe that's why we don't want to have these games come out over here for some reason.

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
But at the same time, it's not like it's going to accidentally fall into the hands of...

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
How do they think does that work?

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
That someone's going to go into the store and somehow get a copy from Japan?

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
They don't do that very often.

53:44.000 --> 53:51.000
Whenever we talk about licensing in regions, I can't help but go back ten years to when we used to talk a lot about Dance Dance Revolution.

53:51.000 --> 53:57.000
Part of the interesting stuff about that game is that that became a huge thing over here,

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
but all those machines were being imported from Japan.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
A lot of the games people were playing were imported from Japan.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
There was a lot of...

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
They couldn't bring it over here because a lot of it came down to music licensing.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
A lot of the catchy stuff from Dance Dance Revolution, like Butterfly.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
Everybody remembers that for the first time they ever saw DDR years ago, the Butterfly song.

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
Well, that was from a Japanese series of dance albums.

54:25.000 --> 54:31.000
They had a license with the Toshiba EMI, which is the record company in Japan, to do that whole thing.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
They couldn't just do it as is over here.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
They would have to re-license it, make that agreement work for the US,

54:39.000 --> 54:45.000
and Konami, in a lot of their hard-headedness, which in some ways I think did come down to business ego, didn't do it.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Wouldn't do it.

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
And a lot of the stuff we got here in America, especially at first, was just like Konami Originals.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
Remember Dance Dance Revolution, Konamiics?

54:54.000 --> 54:59.000
They made a game out of nothing but Konami Originals because you don't have to license that stuff.

54:59.000 --> 55:05.000
And finally, once those games started proving themselves, thanks to the fandom and the fact that the peripheral actually sold,

55:05.000 --> 55:13.000
then they started making more quality games like DDR Max 2, UltraMix 2, which had a lot of US-specific licenses that were pretty good in it.

55:13.000 --> 55:21.000
But even at the end of the day, the arcade machines were almost still always coming from Japan, until what finally...

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
Well, they had USA Mix. That was one of the old ones.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
Yeah, but that was freaking pity being thrown at us in the US, right?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I'll take pity.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
But it was nothing like Max 2 in extreme arcades.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
I think finally, once Supernova hit, it seemed like they were getting songs licensed worldwide.

55:39.000 --> 55:44.000
But there was a huge gap between extreme and supernova, and there was probably some thought...

55:44.000 --> 55:51.000
I kind of missed when they were like, you know, not necessarily extreme, but like Max around there and EuroMix and stuff like that,

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
where each, you know, there was kind of like, you know, you had the European games had their own songs,

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
and the US games kind of had their own songs, and the Japanese games had their own songs.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
I liked the differentiation there, but now it's just like so much stuff.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
I don't even know what the fuck's on there anymore. It's just...

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
It is a lot of Konami originals now, but it's not bad.

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
When it comes to like licensing third-party stuff and so forth, I can understand...

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
I hate it, although, but I can understand the point of region locking, why they have to do that.

56:19.000 --> 56:25.000
I think we need to understand we're in a more world market now with the internet and kind of find ways around that.

56:25.000 --> 56:32.000
Here's where it comes down to. It's really the fault of, I think, the way the US music industry works,

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
and I'm not sure it's just limited to the US, but ironically enough, I was looking at this stuff today.

56:38.000 --> 56:46.000
There is a bunch of different licensing. When you get licensing for music, they call them pro and non-pro artists.

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
Pro basically means they're part of a performance rights organization,

56:51.000 --> 57:00.000
and what that means is you can license the music, you pay for the license or whatever for your game or whatever you want to do.

57:00.000 --> 57:07.000
You have it for your game, but because it's on your game, you're still not licensed for public performance.

57:07.000 --> 57:17.000
If you have your game in an arcade or something like that, you still have to pay for the performance rights for those tracks that are in the game

57:17.000 --> 57:23.000
because it's being publicly displayed. That was probably one of the problems,

57:23.000 --> 57:30.000
where they wouldn't necessarily want to have to pay additional fees to license all the music over here.

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
Again, although I understand that you can import everything.

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
At the same time, though, to go back to the whole region and import anything, how many people really import games?

57:40.000 --> 57:45.000
Not a whole ton. Granted, I really do want to import Earth Defense Force, and I probably will.

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
Honestly, back in the day, in PlayStation, it was so easy, and I've openly admitted this on the show, I didn't import things, I pirated them.

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
I had no problem. I bought DDR USA Mix, I bought DDR Canomics, and I bought all the US stuff they ever put out.

58:00.000 --> 58:08.000
But you know what? I pirated the Japanese games. If you're not going to put it out here for me to buy, I'm going to get what I want.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
I would have happily bought those games if they'd released them in the US.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
And I did buy a lot of those games that came out in Japan.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
Soundtracks and stuff. A lot. Not necessarily all of them. A lot.

58:17.000 --> 58:22.000
I'm not saying what I did was right, but I'm just saying this is what drives people to do it.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
Because then you're talking about paying, what, $80 for a PlayStation 1 game? And it's like, fuck that.

58:27.000 --> 58:35.000
I bought a lot of games at anime conventions. I had R4 and stuff like that. Fantastic game.

58:35.000 --> 58:42.000
And like Dance Dance Revolution, what the hell was that? Extra Mix. Remember that one?

58:42.000 --> 58:47.000
That was like fourth plus songs and the solo mix songs, I think.

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
Alright, go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

58:51.000 --> 58:58.000
SSG100Matt says, seriously, what's wrong with having multiple windows saying before you purchase, hey, this is an import title.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
It won't be in your native language. If you're going to complain about it, then you shouldn't buy this.

59:02.000 --> 59:11.000
I think that does happen on PlayStation. Like the Mega Man games that are all up were all the Japanese Mega Man redos that are all in the PlayStation Marketplace.

59:11.000 --> 59:16.000
And I think their warning is like in tiny text. You could probably easily miss it. I think.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
Well, here's the other thing, too, is why can't they have like...

59:20.000 --> 59:30.000
Well, they could easily build this in, but I know they don't want it because they want to make money from, you know, I guess just impulse purchases.

59:30.000 --> 59:39.000
But why couldn't they just, you know, have like Android does where say you need to return the game, you can do it within like, you know, say seven days or something like that and get your money back.

59:39.000 --> 59:50.000
And at the very least, you know, if it's, oh, I can't understand this game because it's all in Japanese or something, you know, maybe I thought I could get through, but it's too text intensive to actually be able to play it.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
You know, this isn't for me. I'm going to return it and get my money back or something like that.

59:53.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I don't see why they couldn't do that now, but I don't know. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but they could easily do that.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I think that I am surprised that they don't open the marketplaces up because there's a lot of games that do want to purchase that like Earth Defense Force.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
If I could buy Earth Defense Force 4 without having to import that thing. Hell yeah, I'd buy digitally.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I would totally buy it. I would have already bought it digitally, you know, but I'm going to have to pay seventy dollars to import that.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
A lot of people, not necessarily a lot of people in chat, but a lot of people I know talking about this game from our chat room.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, this region deal just reminded me of something else I played this week, Phantasy Star Online 2.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And yeah, just irritating that Sega will not put that game out here, but maybe it has something to do with the free to play model and the Japan thing.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And you know, that's a whole other monkey wrench in the system.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Servers, I think it's server cost.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
When you have the store built in or what have you.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Maybe it's a game that they don't think they're going to make their money back on as fast over here and so they don't want to invest in local servers.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Alright, well let me welcome to the show, she's here ladies and gentlemen, Dark Soccer, or Jamie Summers.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Hi.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Hi, welcome. You made it.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Yeah, this has been a harrowing day.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Yeah?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Trying to get in the chat.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Productive day though, right?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Yeah, we found a house that if all goes well, we're buying it.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Amazing.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
And it's actually relatively close to here.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Wow, really?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
It's over by ARC.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Okay.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It's a big house.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Yeah, I saw it from the picture you sent, yeah.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And it has perfect studio room.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Wow.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Moving on up.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Well, we'll keep our fingers crossed.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
We don't want to get ahead of ourselves.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
We'll keep our fingers crossed for you.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
We do not, but it is, it's adorbs.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Nice.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And it has almost no yard, so it's awesome.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Well, good luck.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
You walked in on a story about Nintendo defending region locking.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
So, and now you were talking about the whole, you know, the fact that Xbox One and Sony

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
won't do it, but Nintendo is saying, you know, we're not doing this out of business ego.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
We have to do it.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
There's reasons behind it, but I'm kind of like, but your peers don't do it.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
So, I don't know.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Anyway, I think that Nintendo tries to do things their own way.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And by the way, thank you.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Thank you for congratulations.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I, there's, I know reasons for doing it for controlling markets, at least.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
And I know Nintendo tends, for as much as they like to innovate with the system, they

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
like to stay traditional with the business model.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
So, it's sort of that same interesting, it's actually something I've noticed with a lot

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
of Japanese businesses, that they'll tend to innovate with the tech or with the product

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
that's going out, but keep their business model and their business practices very conservative.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And if this has been business as usual for them, I don't see them straying from it.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Okay.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
So, I'm surprised that they kind of went back on the whole, you know, region free stuff

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.000
because I remember the portable consoles from them used to be region free up until the 3DS.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And it's kind of weird that they went back on.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I mean, I guess there was a lot of piracy in the DS.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Maybe that was the reason they were trying to limit that.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Maybe, I don't know.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Maybe it has to, you know, I'm thinking the whole, like, the DLC and that stuff, like,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I kind of think there's something there with that too.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
See, I would agree with you if they were full into DLC and like online.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Well, they're starting to move that way though.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I mean, Super Luigi U.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
How long has it taken them?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I mean, seriously.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
But they're there.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
The plans are being set in motion.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I don't think they're there yet.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Well, they're coming.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
All right, anyhow.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Give me downloadable tracks and Mario Kart 8 and we'll talk.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Be careful what you wish for, young man.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I'm seriously, like, Mario Kart always sells me a console for Nintendo.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's sad, but, like, I do like the idea of playing on a separate screen because, you know,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
my wife does hog the TV a lot.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
All right.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Or I have a laptop, I guess.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Well, Dark Sakura, I'm dying to talk to you about Atari Party and your gaming week,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
but we'll make the listeners wait a little bit.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
We'll do that at the top of Part B.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Yes.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Tonight.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
So, we'll do that after the break tonight.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I can say though.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
We did do some reminiscing.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Tons of fun.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
We did do some reminiscing at the top of the show even though I didn't go to Atari Party

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
because, you know, rehearsals.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Well, you know what next week is, yes?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yes, and I want to go so bad, but I can because I got Clue, rehearsals, and other stuff.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
You know what?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
What?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
California Shrews only once a year.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
You can watch Clue anytime.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
No, but the Clue performance is only once a year, man.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
My costume's sitting over there.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Okay, Colonel Mustard.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Anyhow.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Just don't let me find a wrench in your, you know.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
July 27th.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Colonial Theater in Sacramento.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Yours truly.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
On stage.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
On screen.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Clue.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
All right.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Let's move on with video game news.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Dark Soccer was bringing a lot of indie game news tonight since she's still getting powered

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
on here.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I'm totally getting this game.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Undertale.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I don't know much about this, but Undertale is a traditional role-playing game, but it's

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
trying to avoid violence.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So, it's like a pacifist role-playing game.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000
So, Undertale is a place where humans and monsters used to coexist peacefully, but as

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
the two races tore apart because of war, the monsters went underground, and a child tumbles

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
through a great hole and falls into a monster-filled domain.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Wasn't that the plot of Monsters, Inc.?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Sort of, but I like the twist on this.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Kitty.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I like the twist on this one.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Kitty.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So, yeah, Undertale is a game where no one gets hurt.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It says the ability to take out enemies with a click still exists, but so do alternate

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
options.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
You can befriend a boss that you've encountered by talking to them.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Why not show your foes mercy and spare them?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I think that's kind of neat.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Something a little different.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Yeah, it gives you the opportunity to talk to them out of kicking your ass.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Let's see, the game is funding right now on Kickstarter, because you know a lot of these

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
indie games are, and the funding ends on July 24th.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Windows, PC, and Mac, and it will be released in summer 2014.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
This may take my Kickstarter virginity.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Oh, yeah?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Yeah.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
You got into it, huh?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Yeah, it's such a neat concept, and I've really been getting more and more into the indie

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
game scene, so I'm excited.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
You missed my gaming week.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I've played a shit ton of indie stuff thanks to that fucking Steam trading card thing.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
It's addicting.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Well, I played a shit ton of old stuff.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Have you played Binding of Isaac?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I haven't.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
That game is disturbing.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I've started it.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
It was really like, the controls bizarre on it, so I was like, this looks like Zelda,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
but bloody.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Yeah, well, it looks like Zelda, but it doesn't play anything like it.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
It plays more like Rogue.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
No, it doesn't.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
It really is Rogue.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It was alright, I started it.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I think I need to do like Operation Play My Steam games or something like that, because

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I seriously have like 150 games that I know I haven't touched a lot of them.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
A lot of them are like, dude, I gotta get that, especially like Arma 2.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I need to get that to play DayZ.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Not touched it once.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Not even a single time.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and games that

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
are coming a whole lot sooner than summer 2014, like this week.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Yeah, not a whole lot this week, but there are some actual games.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Dark on Xbox 360, kind of a stealth vampire game that's okay, I guess.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.000
That's coming from Calypso NCAA Football, 2014, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
360 this week.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:18.000
The Metal Gear Solid Collection, Legacy Collection, which is pretty much all your Metal Gear games

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:29.000
that you could possibly want on the PlayStation 3, including, they even have like the original

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Metal Gear games in there as well, so that's kind of cool.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And I want to say also this week, I think was the expansion for Civilization V?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Woot!

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
It is this week.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So, yeah, so that'll be coming out as well.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I'm trying to think, did I forget anything else here?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Let's see here.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yeah, Brave New World was this week.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Okay, cool.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And I thought there was one other game.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I'm forgetting here.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
What is it?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Nope.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Nope, that was it.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
All right.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Then let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases over there on the

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
PlayStation 3 this week.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
On kind of an off cycle day, July 10th, Nobunaga no Yabu Online, Tenka Mugen no Shu comes out

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
in Treasure and regular editions.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I'm thinking that's an expansion.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I think Nobunaga no Yabu is already out there, so I think this is an expansion version that's

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
coming out from Koe.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Of course, the Nobunaga games have been huge in Japan for years, but they never really

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
seem to catch on here the same way.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
But coming out on July 11th, Battlefield 3 gets a price reduction.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Dead Island Riptide gets its Japanese release.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Metal Gear Solid, the Legacy Collection will be there as well.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And something called a PlayStation 3 HDD Recorder Pack in 250 gig.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I think that's, oh, yeah, they have the whole, like, TiVo thing built into the PS3s in some

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
places over there.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
So we don't really have that so much here.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So you have that to look forward to if you need a 250 gig drive for all your TV recording

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
in Japan.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Otherwise, on the Xbox 360 this week, Dead Island Riptide also gets its release there

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
and Battlefield 3 a price reduction.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Monster Hunter Frontier G2 also gets a premium package.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
That, again, is on the Xbox 360.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, not a lot unless you need some new headphones because

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
that's a peripheral that's out this week.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:29.000
On the Wii U, July 13th, we'll see the release of New Super Luigi U as well as Pikmin 3.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Kind of bam, bam, getting hit with two games there.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:39.000
There's a new Wii U Premium Set 32 gig in white also to look forward to on that day.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
So kind of another little, I'm sure there will be a lot of promotion, almost like a

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
soft relaunch of the Wii U with some of those games behind it.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.000
On the 3DS, not a lot, but there is Yuukai Watch, which is, I'm trying to see what this game is.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Is it Yuukai or Yo-kai?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I think it's Yo-kai.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
That means monster or demon watch.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
It definitely is some type of little kitty demon thing.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I wonder if that's based on an anime.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
It's an RPG.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yeah, Yo-kai.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Alright, and let me look at the PSP because there's still games that come out there occasionally.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Yes, actually there are quite a few things this week.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Samurai Do Portable gets a price reduction.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:32.000
As far as new games go, there is Hanayakakana Waraga Ichizoku Saugare Polar Star in regular and limited edition.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And there's even a whole little set you can get with this as well.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Alright, that's it for Japanese releases.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
How about the UK?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Some stuff.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
On July 8th, we have Kavinsky for mobile Android iPad iPhone.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
On the 11th, we have Star Wars Pinball for Wii U and Tiny Thief for iPhone.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
On the 12th, we have a Dynasty Warriors 8.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
That's all.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And yes, she got here in time to do the classic game of the week.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I sped past a CHP guy and he didn't even bat an eye.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
He's like, go on girl, you go.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
We would have rolled it over until she got here if we had to.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
But we do have a couple more stories now that we're back on track. Loki.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Sorry, you put Saints Row in there as a classic game of the week.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I did play a lot of Commodore 64 games this week too.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Rob, they had all kinds of Atari computers and I played R-Type.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Did you?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Yeah.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And it sucks on the joystick, just saying.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Save it for the next half of the show, Loki.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
So now there's another new feature coming to Steam and that is Twitch integration.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
You can actually link your Twitch account with your Steam account.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And of course, what's the first thing that's going to make use of it?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Dota 2. Yay.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:00.000
You'll be able to, I guess, watch Dota tournaments in-game or via, I guess, Twitch.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I don't know if they're going to have a specific app or something as part of the Steam store.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I don't know.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I didn't really poke around for that because I'm not really a big Dota 2 player.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I've tried it and, you know, it's just, that's a genre I haven't been able to crack yet.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
So the whole, what do they call those? Mobas?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Yeah, Massive Online Battle Arena.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Yeah.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
MobaMoga?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
MobaMoga?

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
So, yeah, I haven't really gotten into those hardcore.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
But it doesn't sound like you can stream through this Twitch integration.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Like, Origin supposedly let you do, although it never worked for me.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Yeah, you can't stream, but you can actually, I guess, watch it.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
And they said also that you can, what was it?

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
You can get, like, oh, actually, they're launching this August 7th.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
So it's not something you can do yet.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
But I don't know if they're going to have-

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That's why I haven't seen ads for it. That makes sense now.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Yes, I guess now, I guess you can receive special items if you watch certain tournaments or something like that.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
So they're going to have, how much do you want to bet? Steam trading cards?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
How much do you want to bet?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Twitch, Twitch, Twitch. And I'm not talking about the website. That is actually my head twitching.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Alright.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Hey, Bobby, you know what VoG needs?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Uh oh.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Trading cards.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Oh god, don't give him ideas.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
VoG trading cards.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
You could trade the loot.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
That would be fun to make.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
You could maybe trade the loot or something.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I could totally make trading cards.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Oh boy, here we go.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
If you pay me for it.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
You know who does, you know who does some pretty interesting cards?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I'll pay you in Pinkberry.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Ooh, I could deal with that.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Bresl, you know.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Oh yeah, he does his little-

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
You know, I've got like four magic cards from him, and one of them was from when Shermy was alive, and it was Geek Cat.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
So Shermy is a magic card.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Aww.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Yeah, she's a legend.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
That's fun.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Alright, one more story for you guys, and it's about the Double Fine Project Broken Age.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
This is probably the first Kickstarter project most of us heard about it.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Oh god.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And yeah, Broken Age apparently needs a little more money.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Well, here's the thing. I've heard two sides to this story.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I've heard, so I'm going to read this.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
As it was reported on Joystiq here, it says,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000
they need more capital than the 3.3 million that it crowdfunded in March of 2012 through Kickstarter.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
And there's a backers only update that says,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000
quote, even though we received much more money from our Kickstarter than we or anybody anticipated,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000
that didn't stop me from getting excited and designing a game so big that it would need even more money.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:42.000
So Double Fine will release the, I guess a refined version of the first half of the game in January of 2014,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
when the income through early access should give production for the rest of the game.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Now, I saw this somewhere, I don't know if it was Twitter or Tumblr or both,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
that people might be misconstruing this a bit and that they're actually trying,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
they're not trying to raise the money for this project,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000
but they're putting it out there early so they can raise the capital to do other projects.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So the media might be jumping, like crossing lines a little bit here saying,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.000
oh, Kickstarter screwed up and nobody knows what the fuck they're doing on that site.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I think they're just a little suspicious because, you know,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
first they did this and they raised so much money and, you know, it should be enough.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Of course, you know, you adjust your budget for your game when you get a ton of extra revenue and stuff.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And that's why they have those stretch goals and stuff like that.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000
And then, of course, there's the massive Chalice game that's also being done by them

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000
that also just got Kickstarted that they're getting funding for already for a game that they haven't even finished the first one.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Yeah, I mean, I understand they have multiple teams working over there.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And now they're really, you know, they're trying to raise more funding for, you know,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
what originally seemed like this original game, but it may be for a future project.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
So it's like kind of like you guys are asking for a lot of money from us for different things.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And yet you still haven't been able to deliver on anything yet.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And I think that's kind of where the suspicion is.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But you know what? That's unlike a lot of the Kickstarter projects.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And, you know, even with the Ouya and stuff, you raise all this money, why couldn't you deliver them on time?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Well, it's because you can use DHL. I mean, all the money in the world is not going to make DHL good.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I mean, seriously.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Well, all the money in the world could maybe get FedExed to buy them.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
At least it didn't ship them Old Dominion. It wouldn't be here yet.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
It would be on a freaking turtle in the middle of the ocean, OK?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.000
All right, let's travel back to a time that was a lot more simpler than this.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
A lot more simpler?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
A lot more simpler with its grammar.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
You know what? You didn't have to wait for DHL to ship your game from Hong Kong.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
You walked into Best and you bought it.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Oh, no, no. You got it from Montgomery Ward, who's the mail order.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
That's right. It's the classic game of the week.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000
And then you'd get out your little magazine and order something from Funkoland.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
You check the price of it on their little newspaper.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
You know that was Dan started at Funkoland before the game came out?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
No, I know, I know, yeah.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I remember when they were an ad on the back of the magazine offering to buy your games.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
But anyway, the classic game of the week.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Millipede. Not centipede. Millipede.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And it was also known as Millipede Revenge of the Giant Instinct.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Insects. Why do I say instincts?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Miripido Kyodai Konchuu no Gyakushuu.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And that was its Famicom release.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
It came out in 1982 by Atari.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It is the sequel to Centipede.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And basically you have to score as many points as possible by destroying all the segments of the millipede as it moves down on the screen.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
When you destroy a section, it becomes a mushroom.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And you use a trackball to play it.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
So you don't even need a joystick. This is old school.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And guess what?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
The reason why I brought this up is because we actually had a prototype cartridge of it for the Atari 5200.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So when I bring up lists, I will tell you if you have an Atari 5200, I will tell you how to get it.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Atari age. They're great people. Anyway.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
So basically, the big differences between Millipede and Centipede.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And keep in mind, I like Millipede better than Centipede.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Is that the earwig is the same as the scorpion and centipede.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
So it makes poisonous mushrooms.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And it makes the millipede charge right towards the bottom.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000
The bee basically does the same thing as the centipede.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It drops mushrooms on a vertical line.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And takes two shots to kill.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
The spider bounces all over the screen.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
But you can get multiple spiders. You have an inchworm.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
And when it hits, it slows all the enemies on the screen for a short period of time.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
You have the beetle that crawls around the player area.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
And then goes into the leaves.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And it turns any mushroom it touches into indestructible flowers.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And when it hits, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The dragonfly drops mushrooms while zigzagging.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And it can be destroyed with one shot.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
The mosquito bounces off the sides.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And when you hit it, it scrolls the screen up one row.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And then there's a DDT bomb that you can blow up with one shot.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And it destroys all the enemies and mushrooms within its blast radius.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
But when the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
So you can have up to four bombs in play at a time.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Basically, when you get rid of all of the poisoned mushrooms, they all revert to normal.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And they all turn into normal when you lose a life.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So they don't have to worry about that if you happen to suck and die.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And you have new mushrooms growing on the field when others go.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
And it's just really awesome.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It's basically just scrolling and shooting as fast as possible.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
And to me this was harder than centipede.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And a lot more challenging.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
It just moved a lot faster.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
It was so much fun.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
And it has... centipede and millipede both have the best 1-up sound.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
The...

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Which I can't do because I have no voice...

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
As far as releases that came out.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
It came out on the Atari 8-bit and ST computer line and the Atari 2600.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
There was a NES version published in 1985.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
It came out with centipede on the Game Boy as Arcade Classics number 2 centipede millipede.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
It was released with centipede on Xbox 360 on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And it was going to be...

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
The Atari 2600 port was going to be a launch title for the Xbox 360

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
and the Games For Windows Live Game Room thing.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
It was on the Game Room on May 26, 2010.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Now like I was saying...

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
There are various prototype carts out there.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
We have a version for Atari 5200.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And I believe it might have been a...

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
A conversion from one of the PC versions.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
But it's really good.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
We've got Atari Trackball, which is almost as big as an Atari 5200.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And if you've ever seen an Atari 5200, that sucker's huge.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
You know, I was not a fan of this on the Xbox 360 Arcade.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And you know why? No Trackball.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
You cannot play this game without a Trackball.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Trackball or get out.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
If you play it on an Atari 2600 joystick, it's not the same.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
It's not the same.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It's like playing Tempest without a Trackball.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Well, you know what?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
You need the twist dial for Tempest.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
That's what I meant.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
We were actually going to try to make a...

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Because we actually have Tempest 5200.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Actually, Tempest with a Trackball, though, is okay.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Tempest worked well with a Trackball.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And if a mouse is on the right settings, that's like the closest you get.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
But it just doesn't work.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
But then again, Tempest 2000 was pretty kickass.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Well, I'm going to go ahead and say, as I said earlier,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
that for anybody who happens to have an Atari 5200,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
go to Atari Age, you can buy the copy.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I think that we paid like 25 for ours.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
We also did get a copy of Tempest for the Atari 5200.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And I'll tell you, they're great people.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
They make really quality products.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000
They come in, I believe it's refurbished cartridges, repurposed cartridges.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And it's just, they're great people.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.000
So if you've got the 5200, definitely get their release of Millipede.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
As far as high scores, by the way,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
there was a high score set by Donald Hayes in New Hampshire

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
of 10,627,331 points.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
That was in 1994.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And then the highest score in tournament play was also set by him

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
at almost 7,000,000 points.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.000
The default high scores in the arcade are actually FXL and ED.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
ED is for Ed Log, who was the design and programmer.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
And Franz Lasinger was also a designer and tester.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And it was the only way that they could get their credits in the game

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
because at the time Atari didn't allow them to put their credits in.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
And that is your trivia.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
That is a classic game. It is Millipede.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
All right. Millipede is the classic game of the week.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
A very fitting choice considering some of the shenanigans

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
you've been up to this week.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
And I'm sure we'll get something out of California Xtreme next week.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Have you ever done the Journey video game? It might be time.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
It might be time.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I have. Well, not the Journey video game.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
But I've played it a bunch of times.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And then I screamed and cried a little bit and felt sick.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
All right.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And as I say, just hold on.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Because the Atari 800, there's mentions of it coming up next part.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
All right.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
As far as what systems I don't have, I do not have the Fairchild Channel-F.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Just saying.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
If somebody's looking to buy a Darksider system.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Or the first Magnavox Odyssey. But I do have an Odyssey, too.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Do you have a Virtual Boy?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Yes, I do.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Wow. I didn't know that.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
There's a Virtual Boy that came in the phone case.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Because Dan bought it from Blockbuster.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I want to come over and get a headache.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Sure.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Maybe we'll have a great big headache party.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I'll play my 3DS on 3D.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And you can play the Virtual Boy.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And then we'll both be in pain.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And then we'll spin around until we barf.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Yay.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Don't they have an Oculus Rift emulator or something like that

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
that has Virtual Boy?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
That wouldn't surprise me at all, actually.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
This Oculus Rift thing is going to be interesting

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
when it's at a consumer level, you know?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Coffee.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
What do I look like, Dan?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Anyhow.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
No.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Alright.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Let us take a break here.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
We're going to take a quick break.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And when we come back with more of Orange Lawn Radio,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Darksider's going to talk to us about Atari Party.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
You're going to talk to us through our full question of the week

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
about board games and video games colliding.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I am.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I met you, the audience.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
But you can talk to us about it, too, if you want, Darksider.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
No, I don't want to.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
What, you don't like board games?

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
I like card games.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Alright.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Because I've been, I've had my mind blown with Cards Against Humanity.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And we like your emails, and we like to do some FUs of the Week,

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
and we like to take your phone calls.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
All that when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Hi there.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
This is Redertainment.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
And I want to use my voice to tell you that

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Garris ain't got nothing on Samantha Trainer.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Tonight, July the 7th of 2013, and we are back,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Episode 511 of our show with all of you, live.vognetwork.com.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And DarkSakura, she's here now.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And I have coffee.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
After running a variety of errands and so forth.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I'm giddy still.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I'm giddy.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Yeah?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I'm showing off the pictures of the house like it's a cat.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Well, just be careful.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Get the keys first.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I know, I know.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Well, we're-

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I don't need to press Sakura should anything go wrong next week.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I am just saying that we're in a good position.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Yeah.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
We're in a good position.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And it would take us about 30 to 45 days to get in the house,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
assuming everything goes fluidly.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Swell.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Well, good luck.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
We're all crossing our fingers and toes,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
but I don't want to see you pissed off.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
But they have to see our conditioner first.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
All right.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And I got to say, though,

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
that a new house doesn't exactly make for

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
as exciting swap note pictures as a cat.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
That's true.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I could put little doki-doki symbols on the house

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and make it blush.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Or I could make it, you know,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
demonic like the house from Poltergeist or something.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Nice.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
All right.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Well, let's talk about Atari Party.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Since I've been telling the listeners you went to this,

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
and I'm sure our retro gaming fans can appreciate

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
the fun of Atari Parties.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Tell us a little bit about what it is

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
and what you experienced when you went.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Atari Party.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
And basically this has happened, I think,

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
every year for the last, I want to say six years or so.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
And also you can look on Facebook.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
The Atari Party folks have a page.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
But this guy put everything together.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
He brings a lot of his own stuff.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And volunteers can bring their own systems.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
We had just all kinds of things across the board.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Like, we were the only ones there with a 5200,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
but we brought two of them.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
And then someone had an Atari flashback set up.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
There was a Jaguar set up on the big screen.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
So there was some Tempest and some Dragon's Lair going on.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
We were going to set up Alien vs. Predator

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
in the little conference room to the side,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
but people ended up bringing their food in there.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
There were definitely Atari 800s.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
There were Atari, that was the computer.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
There were STs.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
There was a couple links set up.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
In fact, I believe that every Atari computer

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
had a representation there.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
And let me look through my photos

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
because I took pictures of a lot of the systems.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
In fact, one thing that really impressed me

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
is that someone brought in an Atari touchpad.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
There were 7200s.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
There were just all kinds of stuff.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
So why?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Why Atari Party?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Because people love Atari. Why not? It's fun.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
People need to remember their roots.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I was kind of hoping the answer would be that.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Why the hell not?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
When's Commodore Party?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Am I invited to Commodore Party?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
You can start Commodore Party.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
But see, it was funny because this was at

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
one of the Davis Public Libraries

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
over by the, sorry, Library,

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
over by this park that Atari Party used to be at.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
The People's Republic of Davis.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Abandon all hope ye who enter.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Exactly.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Abandon hope of having your car not pooped on.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Tiger Claw on Chat says,

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
did they have some Atari arcade games too?

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
There was a guy there who,

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I think he came from,

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
he came from out of state. I know that.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But he hooked up an emulator that had different

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
emulated games.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000
He even had any game that had been on an Atari system.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
He had the arcade versions of plus the

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
regular Atari, various Atari versions.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I didn't realize that people came out of state for this.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I thought it was kind of a locals thing.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
A lot of people were more like just from out of,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
like our friends Tim and his girlfriend

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
came from the Bay Area.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Oh, okay. Like Reno is, you know, out of state,

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
but it's not that far.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yeah, no, this guy I think came from a couple states over.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
So I didn't ask him.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
To be honest, my sign language isn't that great.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I didn't mention he's deaf.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But he was using his iPad as a communication tool.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And like I am way out of practice with my ASL.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
So, yeah.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
But we, funny, Rage Nator asks,

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
would two Atari 5200s equal an Atari 10400?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
No, because they don't do that.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
One of the pictures I got of a really good version

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
of Pac-Man was played on an Atari 1200 XL.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
There were several different Atari computers there.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Like I said earlier,

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
there was one that was running R-Type.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Another one running Ghost and Gallows.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Just the thing is that while they make the games look pretty,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
they don't sound too fantastic.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And the control was shit.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
It's just really hard to play either of those games on a keyboard

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
or with the joystick, with an analog joystick

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
that just keeps wanting to recenter itself.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I'm looking at the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
SSJ100Matt says, I saw Dan's pictures on Facebook

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
and I thought it was really cool

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
to see kids playing systems that were twice their age.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
You know what, that was something that we were discussing

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
during the event.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I mean, there were a lot of kids that,

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I mean, some of them came with their parents

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
that remembered everything.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I met a really nice guy who actually had a Japanese 3DS,

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
so I now have a Japanese tag on my 3DS.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Well, right here, I should say.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And, you know, I just chatted with a lot of folks

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000
and we all had the same love of old, stinky systems.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And there were, though, a lot of people like,

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
oh my god, you have a 5200, rah, rah, rah.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And I was like, dude, you have a working 7200,

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.000
or 7800, yeah, with the worst joysticks ever.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Oh my god, now the Atari 5200,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
the joysticks were notorious for breaking.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
We had some good replacements

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
and Dan made a dedicated button pad to work with it.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
But because we had that trackball,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
a lot of people, you should see people

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
trying to play Dig Dug with trackball, it's hilarious.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
But Dan was saying that he noticed a lot of girls

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
were sitting down and wanting to play Qbert.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Like, he had the most, he was saying,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
it was like, I think that he noticed

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
that enough women were sitting down

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
and actually just playing Qbert above all else.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
So, and then he's like, is it a girl thing?

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Is Qbert a girl thing?

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I was like, well, maybe it's the nose, huh?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Wow, is Qbert a girl thing?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I like Qbert, what the hell does that mean?

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I like Qbert, but you know what my game is

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
on the Atari 5200 is Kix.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Oh yeah, Kix is a fun game.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I sat and played like a crap ton of Kix.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I got like three split Kixes in a row.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Kix was basically the inspiration for Miss Nude World 96.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Yes it was, but it was better.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
No it didn't, it didn't have techno music.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Or boobies.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Raginator in chat says, I gotta ask,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
did anyone bring the 2600 version of Pac-Man

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
or even E.T.?

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Yes, several people did.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
And I played 2600 Pac-Man.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I actually made it pretty far on 2600 Pac-Man.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
We did have people bringing E.T.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
And I actually sat next to some guy

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
and I was like, you do realize

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
that this is like a prime example

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
of gamer masochism, right?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
He's like, yeah.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I was like, so you're just into that kind of thing?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
He's like, yeah.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
And then we started, remember that story

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
we brought up though where the town in Arizona

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
was willing to let the dump be excavated?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Well, a couple of people hadn't heard that

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
so we were talking about it and they're like,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
well, we get to find out if it's, uh...

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Ugh, fuck.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Rob, that hurts my soul.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I love that game.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
This is some iconic noise though.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Like, it's funny.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
But keep in mind, this is the best they did

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
with what they had.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Oh yeah, no, if you read the stories

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
about how these games had to be programmed

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
like with such a short turnaround

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
and the coding in these games is so tight,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
like you actually...

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
You have no room for bonuses.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
It's kind of impressive.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I think the guy that programmed Jungle Hunt

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
has some weird Easter egg in that

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
where if you get a certain score at a certain time

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
and do a silly dance and then interpretive music,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
then maybe a prayer to Satan or something,

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
then you can see his initials pop up for five seconds.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Now the ET game, do you know the history

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
of why the ET game is this bad?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Yes. Howard Scott Warshaw, who did some great games,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
he did Yars Revenge, he only had like...

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Three weeks.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Yeah, oh yeah.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Three weeks to put out.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
And the reason why there were so many copies of it

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000
is they were expecting that because of the movie tie-in,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
because the movies sold so much,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
that they were expecting the game to equally sell as much

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
and basically it had high sales during its first week

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
and then people realized how bad it was

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
and that's where that urban legend of there being

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
just that dump full of ET cartridges.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I want to see a 48-hour game jam to make new ET games.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
You know, I remember a story we covered on the show

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
not that long ago where somebody actually fixed ET.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I'm using my quarter fingers.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Yeah, where they went back and made the collision detection

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
not so crazy and just made the game better, basically.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Well, I mean, the equivalent of doing this in three weeks

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
was me doing my final exam in one day

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
for my web design class.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Yeah, my site looks pretty good, but could have been better.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Yeah, it could have actually worked, too.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
But, well, actually I did three days,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
got my web design stuff done.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
But anyway, going back to what was there,

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
there was a really good representation

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
and not just Atari systems, too.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
There were people who brought in Atari collections.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Like I said, there was an Atari flashback,

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
but someone also brought a Nintendo with the Atari games

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
that were released for Nintendo, an NES.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And there was a PlayStation with one of the, sorry,

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
a PS2 with one of the collections on it.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Someone had a Game Boy, two Game Boy SPs

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000
with various Atari collection packs on it.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
And like I said, we had Linksys.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
We had various computer setups.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
There were actually a lot more computer setups

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
than console setups, I noticed.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And then there was a raffle, and some jerk face

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
ran off with one of the books for the raffle.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
So someone had to go without a prize.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Oh, no, like legit, oh, I thought you were saying

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
that like, oh, he won what I wanted.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
It was like a book about Atari stuff.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
No, some guy legit stole it.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Asshole.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Yeah, the guy who ran it, Bill,

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
and Bill is just, he's so great for,

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
he had the best shirt, too.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
He had one of the ghost monsters being chased

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
by the Act01 all in pixels, you know, from Ghostbusters.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
It was really cute.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
And his kids were there.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And there were like lots of,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I would probably say preteen and up aged kids,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
and just going around and having a good time,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
and getting to see these things.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Oh, and I've actually heard flat out,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I've never seen this game before, this is fun.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Just goes to show that you don't have to have

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
the shiniest graphics to make a really good game.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And like, Dan, we had to stay relatively near his stuff

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
because we had so many 5200 games

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000
that we brought with us in the protos.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
But we had a few rounds of Super Pac-Man going on,

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
and if anyone wants to look, a few days back,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
well, actually just yesterday's stuff on my Tumblr,

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.000
my Tumblr is Kurotsubasa, it's K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I have some of my photos from Atari Party,

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
and if you're on Facebook and a friend of me,

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I did put up a thing, but I will go to my fan page

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
and share the photos there so that people can see

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
the photos from Atari Party.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Cool.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I had a really good time, it was just fun,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
and the guys bought us sodas, and I didn't drink any

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
because they're regular Coke.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000
So more classic gaming next week with California Extreme.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Yeah, I didn't know that California Extreme was next week,

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
and Dan's like, so you're going to California Extreme with me?

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
I guess so.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Are you going to be back for the show?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Saturday.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Oh yeah, well it runs all weekend long.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
But we're not going for the whole thing, because money.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Sure, sure.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Okay.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Well, I want to move on with the show,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
get into rapid fire news, but I did want to ask about

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
your gaming week outside of Atari Party.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Have you played anything this week besides Atari?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Besides Atari games?

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Well, I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIV this weekend

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
because I wanted to start my scholar.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
You can't.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Arcana still isn't in the beta.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Ah, fuck!

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
You wouldn't have been able to anyway.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Well, poop.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Well, then I wanted to get at least past level 15.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing because,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
you know, I got my 3DS last weekend.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you, slidekick.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I have paid off my mortgage, two room expansions,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
my upstairs, and I'm paying off my upstairs room expansion.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I've been to the island, it doesn't really get me,

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
it kind of gets me some good money.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I have fruit everywhere.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Beetles, nothing but beetles.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
And I have a cross-dressing dog.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Awesome.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Named Butch.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
That's awesome.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Yes, I want Dina back there.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Dina was my lady.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Actually, no, I want the gay unicorn.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Yes, I've heard there's a gay unicorn.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
There's a gay unicorn named Julian, and I said,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Becky, don't, you know, that's not named after your son.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
He's just a gay unicorn.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000
We know your little boy likes girls.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
But if he didn't, we'd still love him anyway.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Which makes me want him in my village so I can be his hag.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I would totally be his hag, and I would put up

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
pride signs outside of his house.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
We'd have a parade just for him.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
You and Dina.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Julian and Dina.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
You go.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Do you think there's fanfic out there that ships those two?

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Rob.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
As friends.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
This is the internet.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
There's fanfics that ship everybody and everything.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
There are fanfics that would take two blades of grass

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
in a Star Trek movie and ship them.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
And no, people actually-

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I want to find some really dirty Animal Crossing fanfic

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
and have some red on the show.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Oh, no.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Tumblr has created its own phenomenon,

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
and that is shipping fandoms.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Creating avatars for fandoms and shipping them.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Welcome to the internet.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Everything is shippable.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Rob's looking it up too.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
You're so disgusting, Rob.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Alright, maybe I'll have something for you guys

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
after rapid-fire news.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And Shakers.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I was going to be playing Ragnarok Online 2,

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
but I gave it up for Final Fantasy XIV.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I did get a little bit of time on Drunken Robot Pornography,

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
which is a great game.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I'd recommend everyone get it.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
And I have to thank Gamer Girl,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
because she got me JetSight Radio.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And I love that game,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000
but I have to do some rewiring with my various USB cables

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
so that my hub will work again

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.000
and I can plug in my Xbox controller to use on-

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Shakers just shipped his pants.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I ship my pants with my shirt.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
But the shirt has to be on top.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Alright, we've got to move on with the show.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Thank you for the classic gaming take-back, though,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
and you'll bring us more of it next week.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Meanwhile, rapid-fire news about new games.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Loki, starting us off.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
So Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to require an install

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
which is not surprising, on Xbox 360,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
because it's such a large game.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
It is on two disks.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
The first disk will allow you to install the game,

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
and then the second disk is going to be the one

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
that you actually play with.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000
So it creates an install partition for the game,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
and then you just play it from there on,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
which makes sense because the world's so fucking huge.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000
The PS3, of course, is one disk because it's Blu-ray.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
You can store more shit on there.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
So you're going to need eight gigabytes of free space

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
in order to install the first disk section

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
or the section of the game on PlayStation 3.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I'm excited.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Still can't wait to play it, and I'm not surprised.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And now, of course, the way they've gotten around things

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000
in Australia being unrated or not being barred

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
because they can't get it rated,

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
even though they have an R18 Plus rating, makes no sense,

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
there is a low violence version that's being made

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
for Australia for Saints Row IV,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
and that's been spotted on Steam.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
So I guess that's how they're going to get around it.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
And remember, it's not the end of the world.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
There's always mods.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
You better believe that somebody in Australia

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
is going to find a way around that shit

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
to patch the game back to the way it should be.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
So just, you know, not a big deal.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And speaking about patching, Fez is getting patched

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Phil Fish said basically that, you know,

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000
now that the updates don't cost anything,

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
he's going to spend a few months, I guess,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
to put an update together to fix the problems that were,

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I guess, affecting about 1% of the players before.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.000
So fix the problems that were in the first patch

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
that they had to recall.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
So that's good news, I guess.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And of course, as a reminder, Fez 2 is not in development

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
for the Xbox One or Xbox 360 because he's still pissed.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Sorry, I'm laughing over here because I'm finding

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
some Animal Crossing fanfic to read.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And this one isn't dirty, but it's about a relationship

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
between Monique and Rosie.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
And my favorite is that they actually incorporated

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
how Monique always says, pfft, into the story.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
And they're fighting over a letter.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And Monique shrugged her shoulders

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
then shook her head once more.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Then you won't mind if I read this then.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I know what I'm doing after the show.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
All right, moving on to some other rapid-fire news.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Xbox One's Kinect will be able to read QR codes.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
This will be handy because that way you don't have to input

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
those long download codes.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
This was confirmed by Xbox Chief Product Officer

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Mark Whitman on Twitter.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
So yeah, that's kind of neat that you won't have to input

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
those long download codes.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Hopefully you don't have to scratch off all that crap,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
though, because if some of that gets left behind,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
then it's going to screw up the QR codes.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
So they'll find a way around that, I guess.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
A little bit of Final Fantasy news.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Lightning Returns, of course, is coming out early next year

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
and invoking a little bit of the Final Fantasy VII wank.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I know.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Cloud-based pre-order bonuses,

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
and I'm not talking about in the cloud.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
There's already wank going on.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
You can actually dress her up as Cloud,

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
which is kind of neat.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
There's the wank going on about the outfit being

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
over-sexualized. No, it's not.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
It looks exactly like on Cloud. She just has boobs.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
And you can pre-order this.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
It's a pre-order bonus. That's what this is for.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
This is currently listed at Amazon.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Don't know if it's exclusive to Amazon or what yet,

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
but we'll find out a little closer to February 11th

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
when the game is set to come out.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
By the way, I should state, it wasn't in this particular story,

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
but there was also news coming out of Final Fantasy XIV

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000
that there's going to be, for the lady characters,

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
you will be able to dress your character similar to Lightning,

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
and guy characters can dress their character similar to Snow,

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
which I think is kind of interesting.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And a lot of people are like,

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
But are they going to be a hero?

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Get your 13 out of my 14.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Are they going to be a hero?

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Everybody on the internet sounds like Monique.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Get your 13 out of my 14.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000
But there's a lot of Final Fantasy throwbacks.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Like, the quest I was stuck on,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I had to kill a Magitek armor, okay?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Get your six out of my 14.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
No, actually, you can stay.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Anyhow, also, speaking of Final Fantasy VII,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Final Fantasy VII, I'm sure a lot of you heard,

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
now available on Steam for $11.99.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Now, this game's been out, you know, forever,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
but now it works on Windows 7.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Actually, they released the version that works on Windows 7 last year,

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
but it's through Steam,

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
and because it's with Steam, it has cloud saves,

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
and Steam achievements.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I'm tempted. I'm sorely tempted.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Character booster.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Well, you need to create a new save file,

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
where you know who dies.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
I know!

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
It's like you can't carry your PlayStation 1 file over,

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
so you need something to kill her again.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I can't carry over my last PC save either, huh?

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
I know. I don't know if that'll work.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.000
If Dark Sakura's able to get Julian and Dina to get married,

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000
or, excuse me, to celebrate their pride in Animal Crossing,

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
maybe she can convince Microsoft to loan a Halo Warthog

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
decorated in rainbow colors,

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000
because this was featured in the Seattle Pride Parade on Sunday, June 30th.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
The Halo vehicle, of course,

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Microsoft's up there in the Seattle area.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
A decorated Warthog in rainbow colors,

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.000
escorted by a Spartan soldier and supporters of LGBT equality

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000
were there at the Pride Parade in Seattle.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Pretty cool.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I like to see game companies get involved in that.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I know EA usually does the one here in San Francisco,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
so very, very cool.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I have some stuff.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Well, Natural Selection 2 is going to add female marines,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
and the thing that really makes me happy about this

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.000
is that they're actually in a legit uniform.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I mean, they're not made to have boob-shaped armor or anything like that.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Basically, they had to take the time to do research, concept art,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
doing the textures and models, animation,

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
and then making sure that the game would sell

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
before they could actually incorporate the female marine.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So they have that coming out,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
and let me see if I've got a date on it.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
It just says in late summer.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:20.000
In other news, Battlefield 3 Free is going to be free on PlayStation Plus this week.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Go get it.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Other free games include Jet Set Radio, Metal Slug XX,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Docoro, and Oddworld Munches Odyssey HD.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Sadly, I actually checked to see.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I don't know if they stagger when they upload those different games,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
but I only saw Battlefield 3.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I wanted Jet Set Radio.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Jet Set Radio.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I'll have to check it again.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
But I did manage to grab Battlefield 3.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I recommend anybody that has PlayStation Plus

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
that listens to the show to go grab it as well

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
because I think it would be fun for a game night or something like that

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000
because I have no idea what I'm doing with Battlefield 3.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Plus, it makes it even more fun that you can fly jets.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000
You want to kick everyone's ass, right?

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I just want to fly a jet and the people and do all sorts of crazy shit.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I think that would be fun.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Is that your goal in life? To fly a jet and do a person?

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
No.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
So, other news.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000
There is a Mega Man board game.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Well, there is going to be, let's see,

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000
it looks like they're trying to tie it in with 25th Anniversary,

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
but it will let you be Mega Man on the board field

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
and beat Dr. Wily the usual way, except with rolling dice, I guess.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
There's also going to be other memorabilia coming out

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
including a Mega Man statue and 3DS case covers.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
But no game, so whatever.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Well, a board game.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
A board game?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Hey, don't diss board games.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I like board games.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Me too.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I played a really fun one and I can't remember the name of it,

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
although it was more of a card game.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
It was fun. Everybody got dealt an identity.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
It was kind of like Mafia or Wolf Game or one of those types of things

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
where everybody got dealt an identity.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Somebody in chat is going to know this.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Degenerate Johnny or somebody who knows their card games are going to know this.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
You get dealt these cards and three people would be the spies

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
and everybody else is the good guys.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
And you go on missions, but if the spies go on missions,

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
they can flunk the missions.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
And if too many missions get flunked, then the spies win.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
If missions pass, then the good guys win.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
And then you also have these cards that can reveal people's identities.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Well, it gets in this really good...

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
You start arguing with all your friends about who's a spy and who's not a spy.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
You know, a la Mafia.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I think it was called The Resistance.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I want to say that was the name of it.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Might have been the name of it.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
That made me just think of that old werewolf game

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
that people used to play on DDR4.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Oh yeah, that's a thing that happens at conventions and stuff.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
That's all based off of LARP, basically.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Which, you know, OL LARP.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Big, big, positive reception to the OL LARP idea.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Just saying.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000
You know what? I do kind of want to do OL LARP.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I definitely want to do OL LARP.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
But I have to play myself.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Maybe in our nod to DDR Freak, we could start with the wolf game.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
That would be cool.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
You know, it's going to sound a little bit sad,

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
but I do miss my LARP days.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Where I would wear this...

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
And keep in mind, it was vampire LARP.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
So it was even more sad.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Black Wolf in Chat says,

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Used to play. Werewolf is all I do at Dragon Con.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I can't fucking wait for Dragon Con

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
and actually play some authentic LARPing.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000
I'm so excited.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
In Mobile, where I'm from,

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
the big convention there is Mobicon.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
And it's gotten a lot bigger, too.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
It was Gold Dragon's thing,

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
and Gold Dragon's since gone out of business,

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
but Mobicon has stayed a fixture.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000
And it was my first actual LARP experience,

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
was playing a vampire there.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And now I think that they're doing a couple of other ones.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
And actually, when I went to...

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
What's the convention?

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Coast Con, I think it was, in Biloxi.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
They did a live action anime game.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
They just decided to make one up.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000
And keep in mind, this is like in 1996.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000
So if anyone wants to keep in mind what was out then.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I did Dragon Ball Z stuff.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I think this is it.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Fifth Dream linked me to something that's on Geek and Sundry,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
where it has a bunch of the nerd celebs,

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
like Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day,

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
are all playing The Resistance.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
And it's like this big reality show set up here.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
So I think this is the game. Yeah, yeah.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000
This is fun.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
This is a lot of fun.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
This would be a good game for OLARP,

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
even though it's not really LARPing.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
I think people would enjoy watching us yell at each other

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
and playing this game.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
It was a lot of fun.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Yes.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Oh yeah, this is definitely it,

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
now that I can see the board here.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Very cool.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Alright, anyway.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Sorry for the sidetrack,

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
but since we're talking about board games.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Let's go to the FUBU Question of the Week.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Take Facebook and Google+, slam them together,

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
and you get FUBU.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
And this week, it's about board games.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Since we didn't just talk about this story anyhow,

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
about Mega Man being a board game,

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
we decided to ask our listeners,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
what video game do you think would make a fun board game?

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Or, if you rather, what board game that isn't already one

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
would make a fun video game?

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
That one's hard, because I find a lot of people

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
don't know what video games have been turned into board games.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
So, you know, if you named one that happens to already be out there,

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
oh well, you know, they need to promote it better.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000
But like, you know, I know Civilization is a board game,

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
there's gonna be the Mass Effect Risk game.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I won, I won, I won, I won, I won.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
And there's certainly a lot of board games that are video games.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
But maybe some of our listeners picked up on stuff

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
that fell through the cracks.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
And that's what we're trying to find out

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
in our FUGL Question of the Week this week.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
We'll start on Google+.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
JB Mon says,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I definitely think that a board game can be made out of Metal Gear Solid

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
as some sort of tactical game, maybe Mass Effect as well.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Also, although this is a card game,

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I definitely think Cards Against Humanity

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
would make a fun Xbox Live arcade game.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
They do have Apples to Apples,

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
which does have the Helen Keller card,

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
which kind of led to Cards Against Humanity, just saying.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Robert Gauss on Google+, says,

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
XCOM would be a good one, being turn-based already.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Animal Crossing also,

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
but it would be a resource gathering trading game like Catan.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Dr. Noir says,

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I've already, I've actually enjoyed the Dragon Age table chop RPGs

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
and am very much amazed no one has put out a clean pen and paper RPG

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
based on any Final Fantasy franchise.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Also, the D&D crossover, computer to tabletop and vice versa games

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
are really enjoyable.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Thank you to the folks over on Google+.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Let's check out Facebook and some of the answers we have here on Facebook.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Ooh, we have a lot.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Jeremy Jay from Koopa Club says,

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Metroid!

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Also, I think The Legend of Zelda would lend itself well to the format.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I've never played the Milton Bradley game,

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
but I don't think they've done one since then.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Clerical Error 404 says,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Castlevania could potentially make an entertaining board game,

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000
especially the entries that are primarily about exploration and backtracking.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
It's kind of interesting, Metroid and Castlevania,

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
and I think of Metroidvania games.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
If I may make a suggestion, by the way,

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
keep in mind that for some of these things,

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
there are games out overseas.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000
In fact, there's even RPGs in Japan

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000
that have spawned anime and various video games.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
For example, Lodoss War.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
It started off as a tabletop game.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Clerical Error also follows up,

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
saying, I would really like to see a video game version

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
or a completely new take on Arkham Asylum.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Now, Stan H. followed up later,

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
saying there already is one, a board game.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
But, you know, it's kind of hard to keep track

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
of a lot of the board games that are out there.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
So, you know, I didn't know until Stan said that either

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
that there was an Arkham Asylum board game.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
But thanks to the boys from Koopa Club

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
for jumping in there first on that question. I appreciate it.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Moving on, Katsuhiko J. says,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Katamari Damacy would make a fun board game.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Roll up all the pieces and weigh the ball to win.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Although keeping all the pieces would be a nightmare.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
That's actually kind of like silly awesome.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Think about what you could do with Velcro.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Like rolling over other Velcro things.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000
You remember the actual Katamari that they had at E3?

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm just thinking of just a big ball made of Velcro

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
and you could roll over Velcro chips

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
that would keep, like, you could add to the Velcro.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
But then taking that thing apart would be a bitch.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Yeah. But it would be fun.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000
You did see the thing about the people that made the full-size ball

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000
as a controller for Katamari Damacy.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
So that, like, little kids could push it around and play the game.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Rob, I've got an easy solution for you.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Alright.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
And it makes cleanup even easier.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Remote-controlled electromagnet.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Magnets? Yes.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Because then there you go.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Magnets? How do they work?

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000
When you're done, you just click the button to turn the magnet off

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
and, boop, everything comes free.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I'm sure that'll be cheap.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And get your credit cards far away from that.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
It's like wire wrapped around metal. Come on.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Actually, it would not be at all expensive.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
And keep in mind that if you have all your pieces as metal,

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
magnetic current will carry through metal.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Alright. Let's see.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Clover Nikon says,

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Well, Bioshock Infinite is a board game already,

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
so it'd have to be Grand Theft Auto.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
That's a good idea for a board game.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000
You got hot coffee. Lose a turn.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Stan H says,

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000
The Last of Us would make a good board game similar to Last Night on Earth,

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
a board game where one player takes control of the infected

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
and all other players control one of the survivors

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000
while looking around for weapons and tools.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I always mispronounce this name. I apologize.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Ciao says,

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
A Mario board game might be interesting.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Gamer Girl says,

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I think they should totally make a board game based on the DLC content of that game

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
at Borderlands 2, of course.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000
It's so fun and just reminds me of the old pen and paper board games.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Degenerajani says,

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
My first choice would be Mass Effect, but we all know that Mass Effect Risk,

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
ahem, Galaxy at War, will be released this fall.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Therefore, I would go with a board game version of Deus Ex.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000
With that being said, I cannot think of any better company

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
to create the Deus Ex board game than Fantasy Flight.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Fantasy Flight has specialized in making board games

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000
based on video game titles such as Gears of War, Age of Conan,

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
and pay attention, Robin Bobby, Civilization.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Yes, I'm aware of the Civilization board game, believe it or not.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Expensive as hell and about 11 billion pieces

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
and nobody to play it with me.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Andy R says,

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
How about a real-life triple triad? That would be cool.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Hey, I'm all for the Final Fantasy card games becoming like real card games.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
As far as board games to video games,

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
I'd love to see more board games get a video game adaptation,

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
as in just the board game but able to play over the internet.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
All my college friends live in different cities now

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
and I'd love to be able to play with them over the internet with voice chat or such.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I'd really be interested to see what a video game company

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
can make out of Galaxy truckers, though.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I'm sure to be hard as balls.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Ragenator says, I want to say that Half-Life 3 would make a good board game,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
assuming that the board game ever gets released.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Of course, Duke Nukem Forever, the board game will take forever to be released

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
due to development hell.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Oh, you.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Steve Chiller says, Super Mario RPG.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
William Murderface says, Disgaea might make an interesting game.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
It could be sort of like Munchkin,

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
but the combat would work a bit differently

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
and the leveling system would be more detailed.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Also, C-Man might make an interesting game.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Maybe make it like Cards Against Humanity.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I'll friend your butt.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000
It's a reference to an old YouTube joke on the show.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Tyler M says, There needs to be a Munchkin, Xbox Live,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.000
or PlayStation Network adaptation.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Shane, our good friend Shane Olinko from Horde House says,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Clearly, the correct answer is anticipation.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000
It needs to have the limp ice cream cone and floppy horn.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Good answer. Good answer.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
A real answer would be Pokemon.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I don't think it would work so much

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
as I'd really just want to see if they packaged in 649 pieces

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000
for every Pokemon in the series, excluding form changes.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
It's a card game already.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Chiggers, last but not least, says, Final Fantasy Tactics,

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
a combo board and card game.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
For the record, you know there is a Mario monopoly, right?

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
That's right.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
There's a Pokemon one, too. There's an everything monopoly.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Mario monopoly is just a monopoly.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
For the record, Rob, I've decided to do something,

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
and I've given myself this idea.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
You know how you can make custom cards for Cards Against Humanity?

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I'm going to do the OLR theme.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
With the print template and everything.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000
That'll be fun.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.000
I should do that.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.000
That'll be a lot of fun.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
$50! No, I'm kidding.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Alright, that does it for the FOOGLE Question of the Week.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Friend us on Facebook at facebook.com slash OrangeLawnsRadio

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
or add us on Google Plus.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Just search OrangeLawnsRadio on Google and we come right up.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
And there you go. You can answer next week.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Meanwhile, more news. Loki.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Yes, let's get into news.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
So, the Xbox One.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.000
They've got this reputation system that's going to be on the new system,

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
and it's not entirely a new concept.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Basically, what they're going to be doing is

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
they're going to be matching people with low reputation

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
with other people of similar reputation.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000
They have a similar system that was in Max Payne 3

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
where it's kind of if people get caught cheating,

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
they get put in a cheater's pool

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
where all they encounter are people that hack the game

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
and, you know, are cheaters.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
So, similar sense to that.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Although, I don't know if it's going to work exactly the same

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
on the reputation system because

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.000
your rating goes back up if you get...

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
if no one really reports you.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Like, if they don't report you much.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.000
So, what's going to happen is you're going to have this yo-yo process

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
where you get a low rep,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
and then you get put in the low rep pool,

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000
and then all the people with low rep aren't probably going to report each other,

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
so your rep's going to go back up,

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000
and then you go back in their pool, and so on and so forth.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000
But, hey, I guess it's better than nothing.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Here's my thing, though, is that

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I thought this already was supposed to be there to some extent

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
in the current Xbox.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
I thought you were supposed to get massive assholes.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
They do have a reputation system in Xbox,

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
so you can block people and stuff that you don't want to play with

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
that are cheaters and stuff.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
But then again, I also have

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000
an 80% rating for unsportsmanlike conduct,

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
but that's just because I kick the crap out of them.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
It's not because I talk trash, because I don't have a headset.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
It's just because I kick the crap out of them.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Mercifully.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Mercilessly, I guess.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
They...

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
So you get false reports all the time.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I mean, my star rating's still high,

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000
but it's just...

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Yeah, you gotta be careful.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
You get, especially if you're playing a lot,

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
you get a lot of false ratings.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Somebody who uses this system a lot

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
should have their vote weighed less

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
than somebody who uses it sparingly,

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
because you know they mean it when they use it sparingly, you know?

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000
But somebody who kind of overuses it?

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I guess.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
There's gotta be, there's a fine system to it.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I don't know what the answer is.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
I don't know.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
It would be, or like if they're like,

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000
you know, rating you for like,

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
I don't know, language or something like that.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
You don't have a headset connected or something.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
You know, maybe flag something going,

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.000
hey, wait a second, how did they say anything to you

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
without any sort of communication tool?

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I don't know.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Whatever.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.000
I mean, I guess it's not a big deal

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
unless, you know, a bunch of people gang up on something,

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
but it's the same flaw in any system, I guess.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Well, remember the Wii Vitality Sensor?

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
This was something that was shown at E3 a few years ago,

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
and you know, Nintendo kind of made a big hoop to do about it.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000
And it kind of disappeared.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
And that was a really poor showing.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
That whole year in general for Nintendo was not good news.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
And this thing kind of disappeared.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Well, news coming out this week

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
about why the Wii Vitality Sensor disappeared.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
And this was in a conversation

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
that Satoru Iwata had with investors.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Basically what it comes down to is that

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
after doing a large test of the prototype,

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000
the peripheral apparently only worked on certain people.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.000
The success rate was 9 out of 10 people could use it.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
So, quote, we've pushed forward its development

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
on the academic assumption that by observing the wave patterns

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
of the human pulse, we could quantify

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.000
how tense or relaxed a person is.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Or to be more specific, how much the sympathetic

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
and parasympathetic nerves work as functions

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
of the autonomic nerve.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
The Wii Vitality Sensor is an interesting device,

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
and we did various experiments to see what is possible

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
when it's combined with a video game.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
But as a result, we have not been able to launch it

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
as a commercial product because we could not get it to work

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.000
as we expected, and it was of narrower application

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
than we originally thought.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
We would like to launch it into the market

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000
if technology advancements enable 999 out of 1,000 people

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
to use it without any problems,

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
not only 90 out of 100 people.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
So it makes me wonder, though, that if,

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
you know, this doesn't work as well.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I wonder if, you know, the new Kinect

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
is actually gonna work as well as they said.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
That's what I was thinking, because I thought the Kinect

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
was supposed to have something like this in there.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Um, you know, I don't know, because...

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Well, it's not like a monitor, but it's supposed to kind of see that.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
It's supposed to, like, see the pulse of your skin, I guess, but...

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Mmm. Come on.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
And really, we know why this isn't working.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Merka, your fingers are too fucking fat.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Can't get your stump in there.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Uh, I'm not exactly sure what exciting games

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
could have come of it anyway, except I could...

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Zero. Zero games would have been exciting with that.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I could give myself an EKG at home.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
That's what it sounds like the Wii Vitality Sensor would be good for.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
What's next, the Wii Blood Pressure Monitor?

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Like, just, I don't know, it was...

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Wasn't feeling it, and I don't think many of us were.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
This is kind of one of those, you know, sometimes...

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
You know what would get my vitality up?

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Huh?

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
If they re-released the Rez Trance?

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
No.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
You know what would get my vitality up?

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Sex.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Pinkberry.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Oh yeah, and Pinkberry.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
I was actually trying to ask IkumaJP,

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
what is the nasty tea you happen to have?

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000
But let's go to other news, speaking of nasty things.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Violent games.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Well, there's a study that came out that says

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:16.000
they do not adversely affect pro-social behavior,

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:22.000
meaning that they don't take regular, everyday social people

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
and suddenly make them anti-social.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:29.000
This was a research that was conducted by

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
University of Queensland, Australia,

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:36.000
that concluded that playing violent video games

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
really doesn't have an adverse effect on people,

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
and I guess...

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000
I wouldn't say neurotypical mental states,

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
but you know, basically, they're not gonna make

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
an extroverted person suddenly introverted,

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
and they're not gonna make an introverted person

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
suddenly want to go on a murderous rampage.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000
But they may make some lazy people not want to bathe

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
if they're playing for a long time.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
How do you know this?

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I'm just saying.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Anyway, the way that it goes is that each participant

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
played one of four video games for 20 minutes,

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.000
and at the end of the test, they had to drop some pens

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
to see how many would pick them up.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.000
So no matter how many games they got these people to play,

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
about 40 to 60% of them helped pick the pens back up

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
at the end of the study.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
And then they found that participants were more likely

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
to help when pens were dropped halfway through the experiment.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000
So they basically said that it doesn't really affect

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
your willingness to help other people.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
It doesn't affect your ability to interact with other people.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Pretty much, I think, it's like we've been saying all along,

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.000
that has to already be there to have the adverse effect.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:52.000
And this was, you can find out from going to PLOS One.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I think that you can find the study if you search for it online.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000
And I found this information out actually through Game Politics,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
so there's links following through that website as well.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
All right.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Let's see here.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Let's talk a little bit about advertisements.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:24.000
And one of the big criticisms that Microsoft gets with the Xbox 360 is,

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
hey, you know what? I pay for Xbox Live Gold.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Why the fuck do I have advertisements on my console?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Why do I see this when I'm paying for my online already?

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Well, it's not going to get any better.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:44.000
In fact, they are working on integrating Kinect functionality with ads.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Hooray!

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.000
That's right.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:51.000
And one of the examples that they have in this wonderful picture here is for Ben Gay.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
That's right.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
You can use the Ben Gay campaign, or they had a campaign, I guess, that ran on 360.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:06.000
And they're saying that new ads, I guess, will support the Kinect somehow.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Voice recognition, I guess, maybe.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:13.000
I'm wondering if they're going to have some sort of,

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:19.000
because I know some of these videos I've seen before will have a way,

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
instead of just hitting a button to skip it,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
it's like, type this word to skip this.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Or they may say this phrase to skip this thing.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000
And then sometimes it's like the commercial slogan.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
I saw that on a cap show the other day where it was like you had to type the little slogan

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.000
of the company that was advertising, that was the cap show, was to type the slogan.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
That's so stupid.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
It's less irritating.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
It's clever as hell, actually.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:50.000
It's basically just to say that you saw the ad and that you saw it instead of just ignoring it.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000
So, I don't know, I'm not too excited about that,

02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:00.000
but obviously they're going to try to support the peripherals that are on there for that stuff.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000
And I think they did some of that stuff with the Xbox 360.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Hell, they've crafted whole games based on advertisement.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Yars.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
And Doritos, I guess they have the Doritos stuff.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Yeah, the dash of destruction or whatever.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
But yeah, but one of those is good.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Princess Irene's favorite game.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000
One of those is good, one of them's not, so yeah.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Alright, well, speaking of things that are good and not so good,

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
depending on what side of the fence you're on,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
the controversial SimCity.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
I did want to add this quote at the very end there.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000
It says, while advertising was more of an afterthought on the 360,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
the Xbox One is going to have advertising in mind.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Advertising in mind.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Not consumers in mind, advertising in mind.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
So the Xbox One is anti-consumer.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Yes.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Which is why Bobby Blackwolf pre-ordered one.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
So a lot of the limitations that we have now,

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
hopefully the release of the boundaries will be widened

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
so the opportunities will be elaborated, whatever the fuck that means.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
I don't know, but yeah.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Alright, anyhow.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.000
SimCity, which one might argue is also anti-consumer,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
at least a lot of people really felt that way.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.000
SimCity, you know, they said this game was not designed

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
to be played as a single-player experience,

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
not designed to be offline.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.000
This is a, it's a, what did they talk about,

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000
the new experience, it's part of the experience,

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
it's what people want with SimCity.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Well, now take this with a grain of salt

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.000
because it comes from a Reddit post of a customer survey

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
that was being sent to SimCity players,

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000
but EA is thinking about an offline mode for the game.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000
The survey lists several features, including a classic mode,

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
which would allow you to, quote,

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
in offline or online mode play a single,

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
fully functioning city using cheats and unlocks

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
that allow you to create your perfect city.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:47.000
So in other words, the game that most of us believe is actually SimCity.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.000
The poll also talks about expansions, DLC,

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
something that would add super scrapers into the game,

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000
clean energy cities, green economies, and so forth.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000
You can get screen caps of the survey on Imgur,

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
which were posted via Reddit.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Again, I'm just saying this kind of stuff that doesn't,

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
isn't really sourced except through screen caps, you know,

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
you have to take with a grain of salt.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
But I think some of us certainly saw this coming

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:18.000
where SimCity might kind of back end an offline mode into it,

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
but charge for it.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.000
I mean, let's just, it could be fake, it could be real,

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000
but we know for a fact that you can play it offline

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000
because people have hacked it to be able to play it offline.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000
So a lot of the computations that they're offloading onto a server

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000
is just ridiculous.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I mean, your computer can handle that stuff.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
It's just, they still want an excuse to tie it to you.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000
So just keep that in mind when you have these next gen games,

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
and I'm not saying it's just an Xbox One thing,

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
it's going to be PlayStation 4 as well,

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:55.000
that require cloud computing for this shit to work

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000
because it probably could handle it on the system,

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
but for whatever reason,

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:03.000
they wanted that extra layer of connectivity or DRM.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
What happens when the servers go down?

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Because they will go down.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Oh, you get delisted from Steam like Darkspore.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000
SSG100Matt in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Did they ask any questions about SimCity Action News?

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000
No, but I wish they would.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
That feature would be like Instabuy.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000
If they could get that back in SimCity,

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.000
the full motion video clips from the classic CD-ROM game,

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I'd be there in a heartbeat.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
SSG100Matt asked the hard-hitting questions here at OLR.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I appreciate that.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Every week you ask some hard-hitting questions in our mailbag.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Darkspore will dive in the mailbag head first

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000
and read an email or two that she deems worthy.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Only got two.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Or you only get two emails the entire week

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
and so it makes your job easy.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Yes, it does.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000
I'll read the first one.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Greetings, OLR.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Loki, I'm thinking about getting a 3DS soon,

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
but the only thing holding me back

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:04.000
is the lack of an R4 card that hasn't been patched out.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.000
The biggest thing I used my DS Lite for

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
was homebrew and multimedia.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000
So what do you think,

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
someone will create a perma-hack for the 3DS

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
and allow me to play my homebrew games?

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.000
I don't know.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000
It's a little harder now that they can patch the system.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
You know, with the DS,

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:23.000
they couldn't really patch it too easily at all, I think.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
So yeah, it's gonna be a lot harder.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
It's always gonna get harder with each generation.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.000
You said harder.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
No, I don't think they're gonna have

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
any sort of permanent solution.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Keep the DS you've got for that stuff, if you can.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.000
All right, next part and a comment for Rob.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Yay.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
It finally happened.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Super Metroid for SNES has been bumped

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
to my second favorite game of all time.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
What?

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Stop reading this email.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I don't want to hear the rest.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.000
It's not official yet,

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000
but I think that Far Cry 3 might have replaced it.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I thought about breaking down

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
and paying full price on Steam 50 bucks for the game

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
when I remembered Loki saying that

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Amazon usually has better sales on certain games.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000
He was right.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000
$20 for a hard copy and I am in business.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Usually in sandbox games,

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
I get a little bored with all the side missions,

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
but the island is so beautiful and immersive

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
and I've been doing everything there is to do.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
I haven't even tried the multiplayer yet.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.000
So if you have a good graphics card, $20,

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I highly recommend it.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
And please ask chat to comment

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000
if they like the multiplayer or not.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Thanks, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtles.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
You don't even need a really good graphics card

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.000
for that game for some reason.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Like I have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:33.000
and it runs fine on my laptop.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
So much wrong with this email.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
First you say Super Metroid gets bumped to number two.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Then you use the phrase Loki was right.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
There's so much wrong with this email.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I don't even know where to begin.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Hey, I agree Super Metroid is a better game

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.000
than Far Cry 3.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Alright, you're a smart man, Loki.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
That's why we keep you around.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
But no, in all seriousness,

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
I haven't played Far Cry 3.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
I can't hate on it.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Loki sure seems to enjoy it.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I got bored of it pretty fast, actually.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Oh, I thought you really liked it.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Blood Dragon was cool,

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
but Blood Dragon was even kind of...

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
It's just...

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.000
It's very...

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
You know, they have an open world,

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000
but it's kind of like,

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:06.000
okay, takeover outpost.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Okay, hunt some animals.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Okay, you know, kill this dude.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I don't know.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
It just got really boring for me,

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
and I never finished it,

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
so I probably should.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Although they have a really cool multiplayer mode.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Like, see, Far Cry was kind of cool

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.000
on the consoles and PCs.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
You can make your own maps.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
But in 3, they got rid of the multiplayer

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000
where you can make your own maps.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
They have just like this single player,

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
like sandbox thing that you can make some shit.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.000
So, I don't know.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Well, and here's the other thing,

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000
is that, you know,

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000
it's looking very likely

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
we might have a Steam sale next week.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
You know, it's about that time of year.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
It should have started already,

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000
but it might be next Thursday.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000
It doesn't show up by next Thursday.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
I thought they announced the date.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.000
I think it's next weekend.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Yeah.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.000
So, there'll be that.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.000
And, you know, I know you said

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.000
the good deals come from Amazon,

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.000
but at this point,

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Far Cry 3 on a Steam summer sale,

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
if they put trading cards in it,

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000
it's over.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
They have like some really good bundles.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000
You know, it's just like they had one.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
It was for 40 bucks.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000
You get Bioshock Infinite,

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Bioshock 2, and Bioshock 1.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000
I already have one and two

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
from previous Amazon sales,

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000
so I didn't get that,

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
but, you know, that was a pretty good deal.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.000
And they've got some other games,

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
but the problem is like,

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
like I'm pretty limited now

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
with what I'm buying on PC,

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
because I have a ton of shit

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.000
that I just don't play.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.000
So, you know, unless it's like,

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
I don't even really know

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
what else I really need.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff I have.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
It's just, I don't know,

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Saints Row 4?

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I mean, you know,

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.000
I'll get that eventually,

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
but I don't really know what else I need.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Like I have all of,

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
I mean, Far Cry,

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
or not Far Cry yet.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
I mean, I have Far Cry 3.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
I don't have Far Cry 3 on PC yet,

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.000
but like Fallout, maybe Fallout.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I don't have the Fallout games yet,

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
but I don't know if I'd have time to play that.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000
I mean, I'm assuming it's gonna be

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
hundreds of hours just like Skyrim and shit,

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
so I don't have time for that.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000
All right, next email.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Hey everyone.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
I just wanted to make this quick,

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000
short, and sweet.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Last week's episode of OLR reminded me

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
of how much we are more of a family

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
than anything else.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
You three were there for that listener

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
as he was dealing with the loss of his wife.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
You three were also there for me

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
when I had to deal with my passing of my mother

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000
along with everyone else

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
that has been a long time listener.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
I'm inclined to say that Orange Lounge Radio

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
is that chill big brother slash sister

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
that we can come to for advice on dealing with anything

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
and will not pass judgment on us,

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
except me because I judge everybody.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Kidding.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
And speaking of passing judgment,

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
two weeks ago with that unprofessional email

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
that came in, as you recall,

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
the entire chat room banded together

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000
and we were ready to lynch someone for it

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
because we are family.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
We look out for each other.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Tell you what, though, I am ever grateful for Rob

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
who helped me set up for my show

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
right after my ex dumping me 15 minutes prior.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
And that's why I keep listening, supporting,

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
and telling others to check out OLR.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Much love, Ron Chan.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
I had no idea about that until after the fact, though.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000
But I still would have helped you all the same.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Thank you.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:06.000
And big hearts to Ron Chan because my Ron Chan.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
And there's P.S.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Hey, Rob, what's the new OLR hashtag, wink?

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:15.000
OLR love fest is the new hashtag, OLR love fest.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Not gonna lie to you guys,

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
that was a very difficult call at the end of last week's show.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Probably one of the toughest, if not the toughest,

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.000
I've taken in the, what, 11, 12 years we've been here.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
But he needed a friend

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:34.000
and I was so happy to see that there's like 70 of them

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.000
in the chat room and countless more on the podcast feed.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
So, yeah, that really is what it's all about.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000
And you guys, you know, it's not just us for you guys.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
We've shared some pretty personal stories

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
over the past few years of this show as well.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000
We've had, you know, not every day of Sunshine and Roses

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
at Studio OLR.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
But we get through it.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Here we are.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Yep.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
All these years later.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Still going.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.000
And just think, I get to pay 400,000 real bells for a house.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.000
No, I'm kidding.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
No, not that much actually.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.000
PPS, two tacos for Uchan.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Heart.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I want a taco.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I want tacos too.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Did I tell you, I told you Rob,

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000
the real estate lady who took us around to all these houses

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.000
and got us this good deal on this house, bought us pizza.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Cause she wanted to sell you that house.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000
She was a nice lady.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
She was legit nice.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
She knew the way to get your attention.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
And she brought us drinks.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
P-I-Z-Z-A.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:34.000
But champagne would have definitely sold more houses.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I'm just saying.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000
All right.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
I'm going to have a mimosa party if we get this house by the way.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Bottomless mimosas?

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Heck yeah.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I'm there.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Bring us champagne.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
All right.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.000
After the hashtag OLR love fest is a very appropriate time

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.000
to bring us back down to earth with some FUs of the week.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:20:11.000
F-U to this damn cough that will not go the fuck away.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Fuck you.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Fuck you.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Fuck you.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Fuck you.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Fuck you.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Fuck you.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Fuck you.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Fuck you.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Fuck you.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
I like that.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.000
And my toes are hurting.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
And um, yeah.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
And girl problems.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Loki.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Fuck you, the long weekend is gone.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Amen to that.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Fuck you to the heat.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Fuck you to Grandpa for living in San Francisco where the weather

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
was beautiful the whole time we stayed.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000
We went over there for a concert on Wednesday.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
And um, Frank music.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:54.000
He puts on a great show by the way.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:55.000
He's a very talented young man.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Um, we stayed over at his place and the weather was just great.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Back here it's hotter than balls.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000
So F you to the heat.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Other locals say?

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Hmm.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Thank God the heat wave is over.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Because what hasn't it been nice the last couple of nights?

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Yeah, it's much better.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Yeah, this week's OLR much more tolerable than last week.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.000
I don't think Slidekick will ever come back.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
It was so hot here.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Now you just brought the heat with him?

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.000
That's right.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Girl, you need to leave that heat at home.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Because he's just a hot mess.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
I hope he's listening.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Gameboy.org.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Yes, artichokes are good on pizza.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Shut up.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Artichoke hearts.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Alright, let us move on with a couple more news stories for you guys.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000
And then Twitter topics and the Skype line.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
But first, Loki.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Alright, so Sony during their press conference actually,

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:49.000
and during E3, they were showing off this kind of augmented reality tech demo

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:54.000
to show off the PlayStation 4 and the new iCamera.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Well, what's kind of cool, this tech demo called Playroom

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:05.000
is actually going to be included with the PlayStation 4 system.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:12.000
And the only weird thing though is that the iCamera is not included with the system.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:15.000
So I don't really know how you're going to deal with augmented reality stuff.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I guess it's an excuse to buy the camera.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I personally, if it were me, I would just throw that tech demo in with the camera

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.000
and not necessarily the system so that, you know, you have something with the camera

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
that you play games with.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
I don't know.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Maybe some of the demos in there don't necessarily use the camera.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
I don't know.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000
It looks neat though. It kind of makes me want to get a camera too.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
That's enough to sell you on the whole?

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:50.000
That looks neat. I mean, I don't know.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.000
I don't know. I need to see more games that really make good use of it.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Although, the move is kind of underrated.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:00.000
As far as the motion stuff goes, the move works very well.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Have you used the move?

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Yeah, I have.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
All the way back at E3 once even.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Toy Story was one of the first games I played.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
I think the first game I played on the move.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
And somebody else I knew had one.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
One more news story for you guys.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
It's about Nintendo on the losing end of a lawsuit.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.000
They actually filed a domain dispute with the World Intellectual Property Organization

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000
over the WiiU.com domain name.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Now Nintendo does own Wii-U.com and Wii-U.net.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:41.000
But an unknown, or at least they're unnamed, registrant snapped up WiiU.com in 2004.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Long before even the first Wii.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Nintendo filed a cyber squatting camp complaint.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:51.000
The WIPO denied that complaint.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Nintendo will have to contact WiiU.com's owner directly to negotiate a purchase.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Microsoft, by the way, in a similar domain dispute with Xbox One.com and Xbox One.net's domains.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
So, it gets harder to get these domains.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
The people just snap up and they sit on them.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
So, Nintendo tried with the cyber squatting.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:17.000
I'd like to hear more about why it was denied.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
I mean, what's on that site?

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:20.000
What was denied?

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Well, WiiU stood for, was like, we invest in you, is what it was.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.000
And it was, it's from a long time ago that the guy registered the site.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Yeah, but now it's just a bunch of, it's ads.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000
I'm looking at the site now.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000
This is totally, this is like a squat ad thing.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
I don't get, like, why is this here?

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Well, they tried, I understand that, but it's still his site.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:48.000
And the thing was, they were trying to take it, saying basically that he's just squatting on the name and stuff like that.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:54.000
But it's legitimately, he registered it a long time ago, it wasn't to try to make a quick buck and stuff.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:02.000
But, so now they can't necessarily get it just by saying, oh well, it should be turned over to us because it's infringing on our copyrights or anything like that.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Now they have to basically go the second route, which is offer big sum of cash to buy it.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Yeah, but this, I get what you're saying, but this shit's shady.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
He's not using it now for that purpose.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:17.000
So give it up, because this is profiting off of Nintendo's.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Nintendo has built the name recognition.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000
This guy, with this page here, this is profiting off it.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:30.000
If I went to WiiU.com and saw, you know, Wii financial investment, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, and this guy's thing, you know, things not tied to video games,

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:34.000
I'd be like, okay, you know, sucks for Nintendo, but this guy, this guy had it first, you know?

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000
And it's just like, it's just like, you know, OLR.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
We probably don't own OLR.com.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
I don't know, who does own OLR.com?

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000
What is there if I go there?

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Remember when we had the sacramentals back in the day as our DDR group?

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Okay, OLR.com belongs to this online residential and it's something to do with New York and getting places in New York.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
It's hard for me to complain about this.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Somebody's not sitting on this profiting off of, you know, here's every annoying rant Rob's ever made with ads attached to it or something.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Like they're not profiting off of something we did, you know, it just happens to be that OLR is a pretty common acronym that means a few different things.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:16.000
So this online residential has it. So can't really complain about that, you know?

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:23.000
My point was with the sacramental thing is that when I tried to register it, it belonged to some Catholic group in Sacramento.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Oh, that's right. That's right.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Yeah.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Remember that.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
All right.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Also word of warning, Animal Crossing will not let you say fart face or ass face or arse face.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Really?

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.000
As anybody's catchphrase.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Oh.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:41.000
But you can't get biatch, mared, and zoot.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.000
How about bish?

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.000
I haven't tried it.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:49.000
I did get, I got one of my, Brie or one of my characters to say LOL butts.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.000
I have to try that one.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Yeah. LOL butts.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Pretty good.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Surely you saw on Tumblr the person that named their town My Butt.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Yeah.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Hilarious.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.000
This will be the best renovation in my butt.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.000
He lives in my butt.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:06.000
All right.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
We're five.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Okay.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Let's get to the Skype line.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Let's open it up.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000
One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.000
If you'd like to give us a call and talk about whatever we've talked about tonight or maybe something different.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
We are open now for your calls.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:25.000
We'll get to Twitter topics here in a minute if there's no calls coming in right away.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.000
But first, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories you want to share with listeners.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Just some stuff I saw online.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.000
They've got a villager mod now for Skyrim.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.000
So you can play as the villager from Animal Crossing.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Murder people and that.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
That's kind of awesome actually.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
In a creepy way.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
So I'm going to point it out in chat.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:55.000
There's going to be a 2D Mega Man game based off of Mega Man Legends 3.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:00.000
I know they've had quite a few Mega Man Legends based games.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:09.000
They're a part of that 100,000 for bringing back Mega Man thing.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I don't know.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.000
What else?

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.000
I don't know.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.000
It's pretty much it.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
I mean, like I said, slow news week.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Very slow.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000
So not a whole lot to report out there.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
It's too bad.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.000
All right.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Again, it's 1877 Game O-L-R.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Meanwhile, I will move on.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Maybe Skype's having problems though.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Because I know when Bobby tried to call us earlier, we didn't even show up on Skype.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.000
I assure you we are on Skype.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Just call the name.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
If it's not working, I guess you could send us a message.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Although please don't make 20 bazillion messages show up on my screen at once.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:55.000
That really annoys me when people send me messages when I'm trying to do a show.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
No offense.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Let's see.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.000
I was going to get to Twitter topics, but I got sidetracked with a personal tweet.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Where am I here?

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Rab.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
I can't help it if I love Twitter.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Oh, yes.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Oh, God.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Tigerclaw sent us one.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
I know this is going to come up on Horde House this week.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Tigerclaw sent us this tweet.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Blizzard exploring microtransactions for World of Warcraft.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
He links this to an article on GameSpot, but I can summarize this.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:32.000
They datamined an item in the latest patch of Warcraft that increases your experience gain by 300% for a short amount of time.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:35.000
And it says, from the Blizzard net cash shop.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
But here's the thing.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:40.000
It came out, I think just today or yesterday, it's for Asia.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Asia is the region that this is for.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:45.000
It's not for America, at least not yet.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:52.000
But I really hope Blizzard is either going to just say, fuck it, and go free to play, and they're not going to double dip.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Because that is going to piss me off.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Like, if they try to double dip, I'm done with WoW.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
They got free to play would be interesting.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:08.000
They are already walking a fine line, because you can't tell me they don't make some good money off of mounts, server transfers, faction changes, blah-di-blah-di-blah.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Like, they make a heck of a lot of good money off of that stuff, and they're already walking a fine line.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:21.000
The minute they start putting stuff in that enhances gameplay and gives people an edge, as opposed to cosmetic stuff, I'm kind of over it.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:29.000
And I know some WoW fans are looking forward to this, but I'm not willing to pay a sub-fee and money for advantage gaining things on top of that.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.000
That's too much.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Choose one model and go for it.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.000
You don't get to do both, especially when your game is aging.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000
By the way, I did get into the beta test of the new battle.net launcher.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:42.000
That was pretty cool.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:51.000
I will say, the new battle.net launcher that has all the games in there, and you can just, like, it actually, I'm going to spoil something that's going to come up on this week's Horde House, but oh well, don't tell.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.000
So we talked about it a little bit on last week's show.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:00.000
I guess after last week's show, Grandpa side-loaded Starcraft, because you can get the free version of Starcraft right there in the launcher.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
He ended up buying it, and the expansion.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:06.000
He enjoyed the little free version of it so much, he bought the whole thing.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Wow.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:13.000
So I'm like, wow, battle.net launcher justified, just wait until they add the free-to-play Hearthstone into the mix.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
It's going to just download right on your computer.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
I'm still not probably going back to WoW, not for a while.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Well, there's a lot of people that aren't playing WoW right now, which is sad.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:26.000
But we have pretty games, like Final Fantasy XIV, that actually have a balanced system.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
And no grinding rep.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:32.000
I'm enjoying some single-player action right now, so whatever.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.000
No grinding rep.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Alright, let's see what else I have here.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Oh, ActDeaf tweeted us and says, after the Atari talk, I went and found my 2600.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Don't know if it works though.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Actually, that joystick you have, though, looks like my old Commodore 64 joystick.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Also, if I may say, because he messaged me on Twitter, I won't give any more information than this, but Micah is who I spoke with.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Spoke to at Atari Party, who had the Japanese 3DS, and very, very cool.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Very lucky kids, having a cool dad like that.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Spazzernator PSN tweets us, saying, we need VOG Magic 2013 or 2014 game night on Steam.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:15.000
He's been trying to whore that game left and right. He must really love that game.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
What is the next game night? Have you picked something yet, Loki?

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Oh God, I keep, I keep, what is that, last, last, or this Friday, it was a little big playing card game.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
There was nobody on.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:30.000
And last week, I mean, honestly, I forgot, but I don't even know.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.000
I don't know what we're going to do for next week, and I don't even know if we're going to continue doing it, because I'm just, I'm...

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Participation's not at a level you need to be at.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Well, it's participation, and on top of that, well, it's because Bobby's PS3 broke, so we at least have two, you know.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:52.000
But no, honestly, it was like, we got home late, and you know, by the time I got Josh in bed, it was like 9 o'clock, and so it's just...

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Friday's a rough night, it's tough.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000
I wouldn't mind if you did VOG game night during Hoard House. If you wanted to do Wednesday, I wouldn't mind that, actually.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
We could hop in as soon as we're done.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I do still stream Mass Effect 3 on Thursdays, I just didn't because it was the fourth.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:11.000
I just, I don't know, it's hard to pick like a game that everybody has, and it's something we can consistently play, so...

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.000
I don't know, I'll have to think about it a little bit more.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.000
It's too bad Minecraft wasn't free to play.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:20.000
I was going to say, we need to do a Minecraft night, I'm kind of surprised.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:29.000
I have the server access stuff, I just haven't gone around to updating the server and getting what mods we want in there.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.000
But they have horses now, and you can put horse armor on them.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
So, hey, horses.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:36.000
I want guinea pig armor.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:48.000
I will point out, we have a VOG community in the Steam group, and to be fair, we have an OLR community on Steam too, but I'm saying VOG because I'm trying to grow that one for all the shows.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Because I need people to trade cards with.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:56.000
So if you want to trade some cards, you want to throw down and trade some cards, get in that VOG community and let's trade some cards.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:57.000
For what games do you need cards?

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.000
I need two more for Super Meat Boy, but I have nothing to trade yet.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Well, I have Faerie Solitaire, like one Faerie Solitaire card I have dupes of that I'm willing to trade at this point.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Because I don't want to trade it if I don't have dupes.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Ask me again when I start getting booster packs.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Alright, I guess I'll just have to start playing.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
There you go.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Where's the list for this stuff?

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Attaboy, attaboy.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:18.000
I guess I'll have to start playing because I haven't played Super Meat Boy yet, and I haven't, but I just haven't played it.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Who posted the link earlier in chat? Post that again.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
There's actually a sort in the marketplace.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:30.000
You sort advanced search, games, and then there's a one in the bottom right where it says like Steam achievements.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.000
There's also trading cards.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
It'll show you what games use it, but it's in the store.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
It doesn't show you what games you own that use it.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:42.000
But I think if you go to your profile and look at badges, I think any games that you have will show up there with the empty cards.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Like you have Super Meat Boy, right?

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Yeah.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
So you should see Super Meat Boy with the blank cards there.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:47.000
So.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Alright.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Alright, I'll tell you some more stuff about that off air that I think you'll enjoy.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:52.000
So.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Alright.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Nobody's calling in? That's really weird.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
I wonder if Skype is screwing up something because...

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
It's probably Skype.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Yeah, because Bobby was having those problems earlier where he didn't even see us.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:09.000
I'm gonna call the nice British lady on Skype just to make sure it's working.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Just testing.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Hello, welcome to Skype Core Testing Service.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Alright.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Yeah, we got it.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:15.000
We got it.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.000
We're good.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Hello.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
It is the 4th of July weekend.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Our chat's got 61 people in it right now.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Are any of them trying to call?

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Yeah, is anyone trying?

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:27.000
No, nobody's complaining.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Maybe there's just nothing to say tonight.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I don't know.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Where every gamer has a voice, but not tonight.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.000
That's cool.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
We can go home early.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
That's fine.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
I can start playing that Super Meat Boy later in those cards.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:38.000
There you go.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Alright, fine.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Fine.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:46.000
If you guys don't want to call in, we will go off and earn our trading cards.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
I'll make the grudge noise until someone calls.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Oh, God no.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000
I'll end the show.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.000
End the show.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Turn it off for Mike.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Oh, look, look, look.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:56.000
It's finally lighting up.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Somebody's taking pity on this program.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Who's this?

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.000
It is Brad from Bot Culture.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Hey, Brad.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.000
How you doing?

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Oh, peachy game.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Oh, and of course, now that you call, like the minute Dark Soccer started making noises.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:14.000
As soon as Dark Soccer started making noises, my screen is full of calls.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Please stop.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Please stop.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
What?

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Somebody had to call.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Somebody had to call.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
I love your kitty.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Well, good.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.000
You know what?

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:27.000
We don't promote the fine show that is Pod Culture here on the show enough, and you do

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:32.000
so much for our program, and you've done a lot for Horde House that I'm always happy

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:36.000
to sit down and talk with you for a minute about what's going on in Pod Culture.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Well, outside of cat the game this week.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Yeah?

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Been playing a lot of the 3DS this week.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Oh, yes.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
You got sucked into the animal cracking, didn't you?

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Yes, I did.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Dammit.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Congrats.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.000
We've been playing that, and Lego City Undercover.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Oh, how's that?

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:57.000
It's a lot of fun.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
It's Grand Theft Auto with Legos.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
It's great.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000
That sounds kind of fun.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.000
All the Lego games are pretty much the same.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:08.000
I'm surprised Loki is not all over that game if it's Grand Theft Auto.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
You could teach Josh on that.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.000
It was going to be a game that was going to sell me the console, but I just looked at

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:14.000
him like, no.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000
No.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:18.000
It's a lot of fun.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.000
I don't know if it would be a system seller, but it's one picking it up.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.000
That's a nice little addition then.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
What else have you been playing in the gaming?

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
You doing any consoles these days?

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:28.000
No.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Nope.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:30.000
That's all right.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.000
I am fun employed at the moment.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
That'll do it.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
It's been your day when it comes to consoles.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Well, good luck on that front.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000
We're all hoping for you and Dark Sakura.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.000
We're the gamelessly fun employed.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Well, I am going to let you guys go.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:48.000
I just wanted to see if I could actually get in.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Hey, before you go, before you hang up and go, tell us a little bit about Pod Culture,

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:57.000
your show that's on Mondays at six o'clock on the network.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Just four geeks sitting around shooting the shit.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Good times.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.000
You guys also do once a month lately, or at least for this year,

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
you're doing Doctor Who based specials, right?

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Yeah.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
It's kind of a sideshow for us.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Have another couple of friends that come in,

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.000
and we just talk Doctor Who on our Tartar's Interruptus episodes.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:20.000
We thought for, hey, 2013, it's the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.000
We do a show for every doctor each month, and that's kind of what we've been doing.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:25.000
All right.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Love it and love your show, and thanks so much for the support

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
and for calling in when nobody else would, Brad.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Appreciate it.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Later, guys.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Take care, buddy.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:35.000
You could tell he just wanted to call in because he felt bad.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
I appreciate that, Brad.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Black Wolf giving us a little last-minute leg-breaking story in the chat room.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Infinity Blade 2 free in the App Store right now.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:48.000
If you want to go just tag that on your iPhone or iPad or whatever iDevice you're using.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
I like free. It's the best price ever.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Oh, do I still have your mic off? I do.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
God, Rob, you suck.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Fired.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.000
That was funny.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.000
That was not funny.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.000
That was totally funny.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.000
That was not funny.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
All right.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Anyhow, let's go to the phones and try to take another call.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Who's this?

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Hey, this is Agdef.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Hey, Agdef.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.000
What's up?

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Well, I don't know if you touched this story today or tonight.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Iwata telling people why he doesn't lay off people.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:24.000
No, we didn't touch on that, but I read about that.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Please go ahead and share that with the listeners.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Basically, Iwata said to some reporters, I don't remember who exactly,

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:41.000
but they asked him because Nintendo is in the best financial position right now,

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:44.000
that why they don't lay off people.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:51.000
So he basically says that laying off people would lower the morale of the rest

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:58.000
and would produce not quality games, basically.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:05.000
And I admire that because even despite the financial problems

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:11.000
Nintendo has right now, not laying off people just because they want to produce quality stuff,

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
it's pretty good.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.000
I don't know if it's fair to say Nintendo has, quote, financial problems either.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.000
I know that's what a lot of people out on the internet are saying,

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
but Nintendo's got a shit ton of cash in the bank.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
They made a lot of money on the Wii.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
The 3DS is still crazy good for them.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Is the Wii U living up to expectations?

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.000
No.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.000
But is it an epic loss of biblical proportions?

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Not yet.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
Let's see where they're at after this holiday.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:40.000
But I love that Iwata gets that, you know, I could lay people off,

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:43.000
but that's only going to help the short-term numbers, not the long-term numbers.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.000
If I lay people off, where are the people to make games?

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Indeed.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
I love it.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:41:05.000
And especially because I think it was last year that he caught his salary by half of what he was making.

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:06.000
I remember that a lot.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:11.000
And other people in Nintendo at the higher staff.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:15.000
That was pretty cool of him and the rest of the Nintendo staff, too,

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:23.000
because despite what happens in Senga or other gaming companies,

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.000
it's cool that people at Nintendo, at least in Japan,

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:31.000
we know if the same happens here in America,

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:38.000
that they have at least a secure job there.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:46.000
They don't have to worry about getting laid off just because they are not making any money, or just because.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Right.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:51.000
Doomplague in chat says, I think Kazurai laid it off a ton of people last year.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Just saying.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Yeah, I remember some of the publicists, especially in Santa Monica.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
There was some pretty big layoffs at Sony.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
And of course, Microsoft.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:02.000
We talked about Game Room earlier in the show and so forth.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Layoffs are inevitable as part of the ebb and flow of the industry,

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:11.000
but it's nice to know that Nintendo is not the first option on the top of their list.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:14.000
And unfortunately for some executives, that's usually the first thing considered.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Yeah, it's really the executives that should be taking the pay cut,

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:21.000
because they're the ones that are making the decisions that are leading to the bad.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
But again, Nintendo did.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:28.000
So hate on Nintendo all you want, but it's pretty hard to get mad at this.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:31.000
I just wish other people would follow that example.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Alright, well, Act Deft, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.000
No, that's all. Basically, good guy eat water.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:39.000
What's that?

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Good guy eat water.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Oh yeah, good on you. A thumbs up for you, Iwata.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Alright, and a thumbs up for you too, Act Deft.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
I appreciate the phone call. You take care, buddy.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:49.000
You too. Thanks.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Bye. And have fun with that Atari 2600.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Hope it works.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:54.000
I will. I try.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Hope it works. Bye.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:01.000
I don't know how easy it is to find Atari 2600 games in Mexico, Act Deft,

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:06.000
but if you go to flea markets here in the US, oh, they're all over the place.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:09.000
I probably have spares I could send you.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000
You can't find a copy of Combat somewhere?

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
You saying you can't find a copy of Combat?

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Alright, sadly we are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but you know what?

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:22.000
You should have called when you had the chance.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Appreciate it though.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.000
You can always send us an email.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:29.000
if you'd like to send us an email for consideration for next week.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:32.000
But in the meantime, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Dark Sakura, sorry you couldn't be here for the whole show tonight,

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:37.000
but I'm glad you had fun at Atari Party.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.000
I really rushed it.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:43.000
We finally actually ended up cutting out six houses so that we could go look at this one

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
because I'd had my eye on it the whole time, and it turns out to be the one.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Nice. Have a mountain of fun at California Extreme.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.000
I wish you could come.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Get us some more listeners for the show.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:54.000
I've been spreading the news.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Appreciate it.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.000
And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.000
I hate my lungs and I want this house.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Good luck.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:09.000
I don't know.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:14.000
I learned a lot about the Runswick A2 Pin Setter this week.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.000
And my final thought tonight is trading cards.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Give me all your trading cards.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:25.000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
Thank you guys so much for checking out the show.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
You know what we say. We do the show for free.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:30.000
We're not asking for your money.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.000
If you enjoy the show, all we ask, help spread the word about the show.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Help spread the word about independent podcasting.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Support folks like us who do this for nothing but the pure love of community

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:46.000
and spreading the word out there and having mature discussions about gaming.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Support the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
All our friends at vognetwork.com.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.000
But even beyond that, all the great independent hardworking podcasters out there.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
And there's an awful lot of them that are, especially in the gaming world,

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:01.000
that are getting to 8, 9, 10 years old that are all doing amazing things out there.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:04.000
And yeah, support. Don't cut people down.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Support. If you don't like our show, that's fine.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
You got this far.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
So we appreciate you trying.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Go support a different independent broadcaster who works hard like we do

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
because there might be another show that's a little more up your alley.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.000
That's the great thing about diversity all over the internet.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:22.000
You can buy my momentary silence, though, with a copy of Magical Chase.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Just saying for the TurboGrafx. Just saying.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
How much does that run?

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.000
A few hundred.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Yeah. That's what I thought.

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:34.000
All right. We'll be back to do it all again next week on Orange Lawn Radio.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Dark Soccer will have a report from California Extreme.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:39.000
If I find a way to sneak over there, I'll have to do it.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
And hopefully Dan will join us for that one.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Yeah. He was going to be here tonight.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.000
It was, but he actually got called in to do inventory at work.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
And we've been crunching his numbers, actually.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:52.000
I would have been here slightly a bit earlier if it wasn't that I was checking on what the taxes are on that house.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Gotcha.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Well, I look forward to hopefully having him here next week

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
because we've had a lot of fun guests lately.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:02.000
So let's get Dan, who's one of the most funnest.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Well, I married him. There had to be something good about him.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:06.000
I'm still looking.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
All right. That does it, guys. Have a great week.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.000
And we'll see you next time here at Orange Lawn Radio. Good night.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:14.000
