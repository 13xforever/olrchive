1
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky, and Loki!

2
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:20,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, July 14th, 2013, there will be no sequel to Zombie U and we get inside as to why.

3
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:25,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Exhibitors are announced for the Tokyo Game Show, and is League of Legends the next great American sport?

4
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:36,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:41,697

6
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:44,538
[SPEAKER_04]: How you guys doing out there?

[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

12
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:21,885
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

14
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:58,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello to, and I don't know how firm his butt is, but let's say hi to Tech Master Loki.

15
00:01:58,727 --> 00:01:58,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

16
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:00,388
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

17
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:01,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing fine.

18
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not that firm when you get two cheeseburgers at McDonald's, but today you have Subway.

19
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,691
[SPEAKER_04]: You going the Jared diet or what's up with this?

20
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:09,452
[SPEAKER_12]: No diet.

21
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,912
[SPEAKER_12]: I just got sick of eating cheeseburgers.

22
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:11,693
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fair.

23
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:14,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually been trying to eat better.

24
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:16,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing more salads at work.

25
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't go out and get fast food.

26
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:20,258
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you like in the candy bar?

27
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:21,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

28
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:21,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to get to that.

29
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have Friday as a cheat day.

30
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:28,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, chicken McNuggets don't even sound good.

31
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,125
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's a good thing, right?

32
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:31,846
[SPEAKER_04]: When the really bad food starts to sound bad.

33
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:33,647
[SPEAKER_08]: After a while, it stops tasting good to you.

34
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:40,431
[SPEAKER_04]: But then Dark Sakura, this bitch, shows up and brings candy bars to the show.

35
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:42,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not just any candy bars.

36
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:48,361
[SPEAKER_04]: They're crunch bars with Girl Scout cookie mix or something in them because basically she brought me Samoas.

37
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:49,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically candy bar form.

38
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:54,228
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you read the label, they are less bad for you than a serving of Samoas.

39
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:54,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.

40
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,952
[SPEAKER_08]: The entire package is 190 calories.

41
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:57,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool, can I have two?

42
00:02:58,013 --> 00:02:58,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you can have two.

43
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, bitch, if you want to eat it, then sure.

44
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:05,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I will just do some butt-firming Just Dance 4 after the show, too.

45
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I had the worst Mongolian barbecue last night.

46
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Never go to Sue's Mongolian barbecue in Santa Clara.

47
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

48
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Girl, girl, first mistake.

49
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:17,163
[SPEAKER_04]: You went to Mongolian barbecue in the Bay Area.

50
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:17,383
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

51
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:19,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet to find a good place over there.

52
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,845
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Dan said that they had a really good place that they went to last year.

53
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:22,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

54
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we thought we were going there, but they went to a different place, and it was nasty butt.

55
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,228
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

56
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:54,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I want to introduce a guest that doesn't drive us to drink out of anger, but we might have a drink with him because he's a good friend of the show and he's been here on and off for really the past 12 years.

57
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:57,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you recognize this name, even though he hasn't been here in a while.

58
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:57,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello.

59
00:03:57,577 --> 00:03:58,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back.

60
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley is here.

61
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

62
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,000
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it going?

63
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcadian42, if you rather.

64
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:03,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

65
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:05,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that still your screen name all these years later?

66
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:05,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

67
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:06,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

68
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:07,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Still going that way.

69
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:07,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Howdy.

70
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:08,447
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

71
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:09,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing okay.

72
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:10,248
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new with you?

73
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:12,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch us up on the past year, since you've been on the show.

74
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was about six months ago.

75
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, six months ago.

76
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't done too much different.

77
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:19,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to California Extreme, and I saw Dan, but I didn't see Jamie at all.

78
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:25,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually hanging out in the Bimani Corner for quite a while, and then I hung up playing Metallica for quite a while.

79
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:27,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I played that one.

80
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get to play it?

81
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:29,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I played it a few times.

82
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:30,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get to play Wizard of Oz?

83
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,638
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I saw it, but I didn't have time.

84
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:33,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see the horde around Wizard of Oz?

85
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to touch it.

86
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:35,829
[SPEAKER_10]: California Xtreme

87
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:30,493
[SPEAKER_08]: California Extreme is basically a bunch of pinball tables and a bunch of classic arcade games and a couple of new ones here and there like I said there was a 2DX and a couple of DDRs and a Beatmania 3 and also it's where a lot of pinball vendors which the number is kind of dwindling now but parts vendors will come you know people sell like I almost bought a Bionic Woman lunchbox like from when I was an infant I was so close

88
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:35,375
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, it's just a big... Man, lunchbox.

89
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,816
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I ended up not.

90
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And people, there's documentaries they do there.

91
00:05:40,597 --> 00:05:41,297
[SPEAKER_08]: They do panels.

92
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:50,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we went to this one that was called Galaxy Game where they were talking about the old Space Fight game and how they programmed it and how much a computer cost in 1971.

93
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,320
$13,000.

94
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:52,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

95
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:54,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was expensive.

96
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:57,883
[SPEAKER_08]: It talks about having 8K of RAM and how wonderful it was.

97
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:02,102
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just a really neat event.

98
00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:05,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And I ran into tons of people I know that I never see.

99
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:09,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like a celebration of classic gaming with like a splash of modern gaming.

100
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

101
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,094
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically if Bobby Blackwolf's show were an expo, right?

102
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:18,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's also, you know, all these games are on free play on top of it.

103
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:24,621
[SPEAKER_08]: And Stern comes out every year and brings like their top new tables.

104
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:27,783
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there was like an Avengers there.

105
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:29,064
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an X-Men.

106
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:31,506
[SPEAKER_08]: There was ACDC.

107
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:35,349
[SPEAKER_08]: There was the new Metallica table with all the three different types of back glass on it.

108
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:36,665
[SPEAKER_08]: and

109
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:41,519
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just really a lot of fun.

110
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:55,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, man, I feel so bad because the guy who owns this Big Bang Bar, actually no, he I think sold it to the convention finally, a Big Bang Bar prototype, which was like one of Capcom's last tables they produced.

111
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,242
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really beat.

112
00:06:58,282 --> 00:06:59,042
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in rotten shape.

113
00:06:59,082 --> 00:06:59,923
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to be shopped.

114
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:08,304
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing now is that you can get repro parts for it because they've actually, there's a person reproducing the Big Bang Bar table in Kingpin.

115
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:09,484
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a kingpin there too.

116
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:16,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there were like the Gottlieb tables that were all like Miami Heat instead of Miami Vice and Raven instead of Rambo.

117
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,506
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, all these little knockoff titles because they couldn't get licensing.

118
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:24,228
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, Data East tables that are always kind of between cheeseball and awesome.

119
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,748
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Super Mario Mushroom world there, you know.

120
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:27,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that one.

121
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it was broken when I tried to play it.

122
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all these other people who were taller than me were trying to play it.

123
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,109
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, dude, I'm actually the right size.

124
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was this game that had like

125
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:40,299
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like called Alley Cat or something that had trash cans and they lift up.

126
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little kid's ball game.

127
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've seen that.

128
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:47,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Melody and I were there, got on our knees and we're just throwing balls and balls and balls and balls at it.

129
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:49,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got on your knees and we're playing with balls.

130
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And cats.

131
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:51,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Balls and pussy.

132
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:53,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, just making sure we're clear.

133
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:53,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Balls and pussy.

134
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:54,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

135
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:55,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

136
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:58,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley, were you on your knees playing with balls at some point?

137
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, not really your thing?

138
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:08,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't get on my knees, but I did play that little, the Super Mario one, the small table.

139
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:09,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

140
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:12,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Mario had a kid's table and an adult table, right?

141
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because they were right next to each other.

142
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:17,769
[SPEAKER_08]: They did have one that was on adult-sized legs.

143
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:18,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

144
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:20,170
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was just to display the LEDs.

145
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:25,446
[SPEAKER_10]: That might have been something different, but there was two next to it, the little one and the other one.

146
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:32,990
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the complete name of it, but there was an arcade near my high school that had it.

147
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Ice Rink had it, and I went there and played it every so often.

148
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,253
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good, fun one.

149
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:53,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just gonna say about California Extreme it's not really just the games either you because you run into a lot of people right which is what ticks me off why I couldn't go because you ran into like tons of people blast from the past from the DDR days right

150
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:57,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I ran into Richard.

151
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw Chris Tang, which you see Chris Tang at every event that has the money.

152
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:06,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I ran into Ali.

153
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:08,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I ran into Wendell, of course.

154
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,438
[SPEAKER_08]: And Chris from DDR Freak back in the day, he actually arrived late at night.

155
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:15,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in the middle of playing the song, and then I end the song.

156
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Next thing I know, I'm in this bear hug.

157
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:18,601
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.

158
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:19,041
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

159
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:21,582
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty cool.

160
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like a little mini con of sorts.

161
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:23,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, pretty much.

162
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:37,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's a lot of, you know, because a lot of us who, you know, started off back in the day, we're all grown up, so we were going out, you know, drinking in the, because there's like a little bar in the front of the Hyatt, and, you know, $15 lemon drop, but I also did want Grey Goose.

163
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're all actually out there having our adult frou-frou drinks and talking about games.

164
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:44,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it more of an adult convention?

165
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm not talking about... There were some kids there, but a lot of people...

166
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:49,035
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

167
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,182
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually ended up hanging out at a table just chatting about collections versus buying a house.

168
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:12,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's what Dan and I were trying to do.

169
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get more listeners for VOG while you were there?

170
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:16,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I did pimp us out.

171
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:16,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

172
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:24,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's some people, I'm sorry I've forgotten to put you on my Facebook, but hi, it was great to meet you.

173
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,051
[SPEAKER_08]: And I met a friend of Kyle Snyder.

174
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,577
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya put together had his premiere in it.

175
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,228
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

176
00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:28,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it was pretty interesting.

177
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:31,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Running into people who knew people that I knew.

178
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:39,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And I spent all day on my DS checking where I tagged people from.

179
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,768
[SPEAKER_08]: And running into people whose screen names I recognize.

180
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:45,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And going, I want to send them a message!

181
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:47,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Find me shit!

182
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,710
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be able to add friends from that.

183
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:55,499
[SPEAKER_08]: or at least send a message.

184
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:01,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually did tag him twice and I could have sent him a message but it was toward the end of the night and he wouldn't have gotten my message.

185
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So, whatever.

186
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:04,861
[SPEAKER_04]: You're having fun with your 3DS.

187
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:06,541
[SPEAKER_04]: This is only the second week you've had it, right?

188
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:10,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear everybody... Oh yeah, I've already got... Let's see.

189
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:12,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I've expanded my house.

190
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:13,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought my house, expanded it twice.

191
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Bought my upstairs, expanded it once and I have my basement now.

192
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:17,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm paying for my dream suites.

193
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:19,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting Club LOL and...

194
00:12:20,544 --> 00:12:23,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Blathers wants to expand my museum.

195
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on it in Animal Crossing.

196
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.

197
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:26,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

198
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:34,201
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because I go to the island and pick fruit instead of doing the little games and then go sell my fruit and then I do it like five times in a day.

199
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:35,642
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how to do it.

200
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,343
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how to do it.

201
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:37,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm making money.

202
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:38,005
[SPEAKER_08]: That's 80s style.

203
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,768
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let me go back to Bradley, our guest.

204
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley, you had fun at California Extreme.

205
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:45,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you there Friday and Saturday or just Saturday?

206
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:46,755
[SPEAKER_10]: No, just Saturday.

207
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,477
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a Saturday-Sunday convention.

208
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:49,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did I think it was three days?

209
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:50,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was.

210
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,320
[SPEAKER_10]: No, just two.

211
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

212
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,806
[SPEAKER_04]: What kinds of games have you been playing the past year or six months?

213
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:58,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you beaten anything lately?

214
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:00,008
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

215
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:27,039
[SPEAKER_10]: As you get more money, once you die after a while, because the enemies are kind of hard and it's easy to fall into spikes and all that kind of stuff.

216
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:29,560
[SPEAKER_10]: So once you die, you basically build up your castle.

217
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:39,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, as you upgrade, you get different options, and you get new options for what children can be, and runes and things like that to basically expand your gameplay.

218
00:13:40,923 --> 00:14:05,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Help you along, get you more HP, more MP, and other options like that And then you keep trying over and over again for hundreds of times Yeah, I saw this game on Steam and I wanted to get it But it is not part of the, and we'll obviously have to talk about this The Steam sale going on right now, which has many people's attentions But it's still worth it outside the lack of sale price, right?

219
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:09,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, actually I did see it on sale for like $2 off or something like that.

220
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Not too big of a deal, but... Well, it's something.

221
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:14,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I bought it at $15 and that's well worth the price.

222
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:20,013
[SPEAKER_04]: That's no like Tomb Raider for $12 or Borderlands 2 for $10, but that's still a pretty good deal.

223
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and you can play this for hours and hours.

224
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people can beat it pretty fast.

225
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:29,380
[SPEAKER_10]: That took me like 22 hours just because I took a lot of time exploring the castle each time and didn't try to kill the bosses really early.

226
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:29,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

227
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:31,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So... Okay.

228
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's Nuclear Plus and you can just keep going and going as much as you want.

229
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:36,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

230
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:37,903
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a fun time.

231
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:41,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Another big game was playing Animal Crossing.

232
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:43,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing that shitloads.

233
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:46,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, I'm already up to 85 hours in the game.

234
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:46,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Like...

235
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:47,926
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

236
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:09,877
[SPEAKER_04]: and part of it too is that it's a slow process.

237
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:12,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I could just open up my 3DS and be in my town, yay, I'd be there.

238
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:20,048
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like you gotta open it up, load the game, wait for the game, wait for the thing to load your town, then you gotta make sure you save and quit.

239
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you gonna get Mr. Resetti?

240
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:23,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kinda like it takes too fucking long to get in there.

241
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:24,232
[SPEAKER_10]: True.

242
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:25,453
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think so.

243
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:25,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

244
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:29,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it is a lot of time investment to do a bunch of things.

245
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:40,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and basically the masterboards I go at basically have loads of people that are messing with each other and getting swapping items and all that stuff.

246
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:41,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

247
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:42,903
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically I've gotten a lot of stuff.

248
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:44,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost done with the house.

249
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:51,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you will get my small pitiful house in your plaza now since I see the green light on my 3DS.

250
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:52,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

251
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,405
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

252
00:15:53,425 --> 00:15:56,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And other games, FTL was a big game that I played a lot of.

253
00:15:56,946 --> 00:16:00,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played that this week for the Trading Garden thing.

254
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:00,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

255
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:03,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got sucked into that trading card thing too.

256
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

257
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about the trading yet.

258
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:10,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually doing the trading because that seems like a ton of annoyingness.

259
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:12,826
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did play that and a bit of Meat Boy.

260
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:16,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Meat Boy and haven't played too many other games that were...

261
00:16:16,784 --> 00:16:21,245
[SPEAKER_10]: in that thing that's trading cards so far.

262
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:23,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're adding new ones every day.

263
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:24,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

264
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:36,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I probably go play... I want to play Portal and Portal 2 again because I haven't played them on Steam yet so I could see them other than 720p and watch them in 1080 or however good they are for the Steam version.

265
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,650
[SPEAKER_10]: So I might do that pretty soon.

266
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

267
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,112
[SPEAKER_10]: And another big thing right now is the new Meat Plaza games.

268
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they just released those last week.

269
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,333
[SPEAKER_10]: You can basically get the bundle for $15 of all four of them.

270
00:16:52,934 --> 00:17:00,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically, I think near the beginning of California Extreme yesterday,

271
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:08,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost spent an hour standing off right near the entrance doing the updates for those, or doing those games.

272
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:17,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, for each new game, you can take all the 10 tags that you have and take them through each game, so that takes a lot.

273
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:20,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's not for convention play.

274
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,340
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

275
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,361
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just too many people.

276
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:27,183
[SPEAKER_04]: For when you occasionally street pass with people, I think that's a good thing to do.

277
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:29,725
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to let you hold more than 10 people in the buffer, though.

278
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:30,625
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be nice.

279
00:17:30,705 --> 00:17:32,426
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be nice for conventions.

280
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:34,807
[SPEAKER_08]: That was annoying because then I think I'd be done.

281
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,569
[SPEAKER_08]: And then like, nope, more people.

282
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:40,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine when I was at E3.

283
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just waiting until my next Disneyland trip.

284
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:43,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

285
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Disneyland's not as bad.

286
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:48,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you will fill it up partway through the day, so you want to check a couple times a day.

287
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:54,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be harder with these four new games because now it's like, now I've got to play the Fantasy Zone game.

288
00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:58,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I've got to play the Kingdom game and whatever.

289
00:17:58,881 --> 00:17:59,381
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot.

290
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:05,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I kind of have to pick my battles and which game do I really want to progress on the most?

291
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:09,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, that's the puzzle trading to get the little 3D pictures.

292
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:10,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I did finish two puzzles.

293
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:10,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you?

294
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:10,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.

295
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:11,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

296
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:14,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they just opened up two new ones.

297
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Right when I was like, I was within like 40 pieces of having everything and now two new puzzles.

298
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,334
[SPEAKER_04]: She's four new puzzles.

299
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:20,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Bastard.

300
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:21,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

301
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:21,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

302
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:22,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.

303
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:25,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerks.

304
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:27,519
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fair enough.

305
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess I've been blurring the line here a little bit between trying to interview Bradley and getting to our gaming weeks.

306
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:36,304
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing I wanted to bring up was Steam Sale.

307
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:39,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you guys listening to this show can't avoid it.

308
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:43,367
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it about the Steam Sale that gets everybody in the gaming community talking?

309
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:43,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's...

310
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:46,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably them prices, right?

311
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,972
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that, you know, what is it today, right now?

312
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomb Raider, as of the taping of the show, $12.

313
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:55,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that was yesterday's deal, but they last for 48 hours, right?

314
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Borderlands 2 for $10.

315
00:18:57,942 --> 00:19:00,264
[SPEAKER_04]: In the season pass, another $10.

316
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cheap stuff.

317
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:02,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course...

318
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:04,568
[SPEAKER_04]: or by spending money.

319
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:25,504
[SPEAKER_04]: or by crafting badges.

320
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:26,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Loki.

321
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:32,594
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave me the two cards I was missing in the Super Meat Boy set and I crafted my first badge before the show.

322
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:37,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got a summer sale card for crafting it now.

323
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got my little emoticon that's deal with it with the Super Meat Boy shades.

324
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got the Dr. Fetus background with the big middle finger from my profile.

325
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:47,832
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of awesome.

326
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you visit my profile, well, I haven't changed it yet, but I will.

327
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:54,120
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will be flipping you off on my Steam profile.

328
00:19:54,861 --> 00:20:02,049
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to say, if you are getting into the trading card whoring thing for no explainable reason like myself, visit vognetwork.com.

329
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:03,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the forums.

330
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I have posted an official Steam trading card forum there.

331
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:11,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only did I trade with Loki, I traded with Rababa the other day.

332
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:15,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting to trade with other people, but I would like to help out VOG listeners.

333
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:21,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to the general Steam trade community if I must, but I'd rather help the VOG people get the cards they need first.

334
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:25,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have a couple extras right now, but if I have something you want, let's talk.

335
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Because now, what do I need?

336
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm two cards short on Really Big Sky.

337
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:33,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have the cards for that, help me out.

338
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:41,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, The trading cards are neat, but I'm annoyed at their integration into the sale.

339
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:47,854
[SPEAKER_04]: They already had a great metagame for sales that worked and did more to enrich and create content for the community, in my opinion.

340
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:52,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, write a recommendation for a game you own, post screenshots, and so on.

341
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:53,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

342
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:59,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, Steam did kind of generalize that into a community badge.

343
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's there.

344
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:07,506
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I liked, I did like how you'd kind of get the perks every few months when they did these big sales, the summer sale and the winter sale.

345
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:16,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I do kind of miss that a little bit because the kind of homogenizing it all into just the general community badge is going to make the sales lose that little special end of it.

346
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:19,113
[SPEAKER_04]: But the trading cards is something.

347
00:21:19,314 --> 00:21:20,955
[SPEAKER_04]: But I draw the line at spending real money.

348
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:22,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't.

349
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:22,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't.

350
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:23,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise.

351
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:23,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't.

352
00:21:25,357 --> 00:21:29,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will probably end up with Borderlands 2 because Bobby got Borderlands 2.

353
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:29,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play.

354
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:30,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got Borderlands 2.

355
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I do and I haven't played it yet.

356
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki has Borderlands 2.

357
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:37,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That's four people to all play some co-op on live streaming.

358
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:37,783
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

359
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,423
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, DarkSakura?

360
00:21:39,443 --> 00:21:39,963
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

361
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:41,024
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

362
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:42,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the thumbs up in the other room.

363
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:43,465
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

364
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:48,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into our other gaming weeks and the other types of games that you've been playing this week.

365
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,020
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

366
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,120
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

367
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:27,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

368
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:28,850
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

369
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:31,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured you probably got out what you were currently playing in there.

370
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:34,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Jamie's back, so let me ask DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

371
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:34,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck.

372
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:35,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Busy.

373
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:39,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a lot of Beatmania 2DX.

374
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:41,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to try a lot of new songs, some of which I passed the first time through.

375
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:44,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing on standard, so, you know, easy mode.

376
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:48,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I passed Starmine.

377
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:49,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Ain't no shame in that.

378
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in your mid-30s now.

379
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:51,812
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to tone it down a bit.

380
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:53,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't touched it since we last had one.

381
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:54,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And what did we have last?

382
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,375
[SPEAKER_08]: A red?

383
00:22:56,276 --> 00:23:00,320
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and this is a, it actually had the DJ Troopers banner on it, but it was a Tricoro.

384
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,551
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to play a lot of fun stuff.

385
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:11,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I played some Beatmania 3, which going from 2DX to Beatmania 3, the timing is just freaking bizarre.

386
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:19,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, I played Quartet, which I was super disappointed that I couldn't hear the music.

387
00:23:19,118 --> 00:23:24,220
[SPEAKER_08]: So our fortune cookie reflects the music because I want to freaking hear that song.

388
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I also played, um, I didn't play Journey, but because there was someone on it every time.

389
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:34,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I played a lot of Metallica pinball.

390
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It's super good.

391
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:40,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like funny with me and three other people behind me singing Master of Puppets while I'm playing the game.

392
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:41,942
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

393
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:21,219
[SPEAKER_08]: and he got it signed by uh the uh I think the artist's name was Dirty Donny I think he got it he just ran into him and got him to sign it so that was cool um I uh I know I played a bunch of other stuff well I you know I did play some uh

394
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:25,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Little Inferno, as far as not classic stuff.

395
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:28,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I pretty much played a ton of different games.

396
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:30,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Timber with Melody.

397
00:24:30,498 --> 00:24:30,939
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fun.

398
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:33,360
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we threw our balls at some pussies.

399
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:34,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was pretty fun too.

400
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:38,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I also played ACDC Pinball.

401
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:39,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I played...

402
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:43,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Big Bang Bar.

403
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:52,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I played the Wizard of Oz pinball and I've got some, like I said, some footage of it that I'm going to be putting on my Tumblr and reposting to the Orange Lounge Tumblr later tonight.

404
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:54,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Including the rainbow mode.

405
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:55,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, it's so cool.

406
00:24:56,026 --> 00:25:08,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like they've got multicolored LEDs underneath the in the playfield so that they'll cycle through different colors over each area instead of just having the standard incandescence of the older tables.

407
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,331
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty neat.

408
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:10,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Um

409
00:25:12,063 --> 00:25:18,266
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I won't go too much into the classic stuff because, like I said, there's a bunch of it there and I played a bunch of it.

410
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:22,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a lot of Animal Crossing, like I said.

411
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:26,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Little Inferno, I finally put down the two bucks to get Little Inferno on Steam.

412
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:27,812
[SPEAKER_08]: It's freaking fun.

413
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:28,352
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like...

414
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:29,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

415
00:25:51,341 --> 00:26:09,131
[SPEAKER_08]: and you just burn stuff and you can like earn money the more that you burn things and buy different things out of catalogs and as you get different combos of stuff you unlock more catalog and you have to use up your catalog before you can get a new catalog and just you have to make 99 different combos of stuff

416
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:10,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

417
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:34,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Put in Pluto and then put in the sun and then the moon and then it'll do everything.

418
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:36,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You get like ice cubes.

419
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:40,715
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one that's called the well-medicated combo that's like wine and happy pills and stuff.

420
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:42,136
[SPEAKER_08]: That one's pretty funny.

421
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:44,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And the wine is called the Midlife Crisis Mitigator.

422
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:47,270
[SPEAKER_03]: What game is this still?

423
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Little Inferno?

424
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:17,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And I actually have not played any Mass Effect for an entire week.

425
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:19,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

426
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:22,245
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the date?

427
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,765
[SPEAKER_04]: July 14th, episode 512.

428
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:28,186
[SPEAKER_04]: The one where she didn't play Mass Effect all week long.

429
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:30,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.

430
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:36,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, in my defense, I've been looking for houses and I didn't play live on Thursday because of the stupid cough.

431
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:38,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know what?

432
00:27:39,746 --> 00:27:41,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm allowed to take a vacation.

433
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Commander Shepard is shedding a single tear.

434
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:51,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes people in relationships need to take some time off from each other.

435
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Allowed to take a vacation.

436
00:27:53,981 --> 00:27:55,803
[SPEAKER_12]: That is something a pod person would say.

437
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:04,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I did buy a few more games on Steam, but I forgot what they were because I'm probably going to buy more tonight.

438
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:09,393
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was going to get FTL, but it just doesn't seem like my kind of game.

439
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:13,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I did get Hotline Miami and the download pack.

440
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:27,387
[SPEAKER_08]: And I haven't tried it yet, but it just looks like it's so much fun because I like going around in a virtual environment, a safe virtual environment where there's no risk that I'm actually going to do anything like this in real life and kill a bunch of people.

441
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:31,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And big bloody massacres with a neat soundtrack.

442
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:37,735
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like I'm going to go plug in my iPhone and listen to some Deadmau5 and shoot up a mall.

443
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:38,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Not going to happen.

444
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:41,699
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

445
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:12,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I figured I needed a little bit more than just the really cheap blower fans that they had on there.

446
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:21,434
[SPEAKER_12]: So I crafted a thing using, uh, basically the parts I had from my, my PC and my laptop cooling tray.

447
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:24,678
[SPEAKER_12]: So after, you know, cutting some of the plastic around and stuff.

448
00:29:25,018 --> 00:29:44,494
[SPEAKER_12]: I screwed in two 120mm fans in there that are from my Antec case so they have the three speed settings and of course you need a dedicated 12V power supply so I have a separate plug in the wall now and I had to manufacture a super long Molex cable to connect to it

449
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:47,957
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

450
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:06,134
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

451
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:31,372
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

452
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:49,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

453
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:53,068
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not picking that up yet.

454
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:56,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Although tomorrow, that's another thing.

455
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That gameplay trailer, which I haven't seen yet.

456
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So amazing.

457
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:01,092
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you feel about that?

458
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:02,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was great.

459
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:02,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

460
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:04,194
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fantastic.

461
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:05,775
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about it on Horde House this week.

462
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:08,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's a teaser at the end about a Grand Theft Auto Online?

463
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:11,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's just what they're calling their online portion of the game.

464
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:15,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there's an online portion to Grand Theft Auto 4, but now they're calling it Grand Theft Auto Online.

465
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,841
[SPEAKER_12]: and it looks great.

466
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,381
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it looks really good.

467
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:37,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, the screenshots that they've been putting out aren't as the same quality as the gameplay trailer, but that just leads to the rumors that, yeah, they're producing a higher quality asset version of the game so that it can be ported to the PC or next-gen consoles when the time comes.

468
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:42,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so y'all know, Loki told me before the show tonight, you will get Grand Theft Auto V and you will play it.

469
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:44,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it was not you need to, it was that you will.

470
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:48,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because you have Grand Theft Auto 4 and you still haven't played it.

471
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Alan played it on PC.

472
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:51,637
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Alan playing it.

473
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:52,978
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not talking about Alan.

474
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,459
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking about you playing it.

475
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:02,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, though, you probably should just skip 4 at this point and just go straight into 5 because it's going to be way better anyways.

476
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:06,208
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, everything looks great about it.

477
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:13,254
[SPEAKER_12]: The gameplay looks tighter, the combat looks better, the level of detail in the game is just ridiculous.

478
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:16,477
[SPEAKER_12]: It just looks fun.

479
00:32:16,597 --> 00:32:19,199
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like a game that I can sink hundreds of hours into.

480
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's not kid ourselves, you will.

481
00:32:22,502 --> 00:32:22,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

482
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:26,706
[SPEAKER_04]: That game will cause disagreements between you and the wife.

483
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:30,289
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, it won't because it's good because I will.

484
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:34,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the only problem is going to be getting this scream to play that on.

485
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:41,801
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I could play it in the other room, but yeah, I can because, you know, my Xbox 360 has Wi-Fi, so that'll be just fine.

486
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:42,301
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

487
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:43,522
[SPEAKER_12]: I can play in the other room.

488
00:32:43,602 --> 00:32:44,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Problem solved.

489
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:45,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

490
00:32:45,804 --> 00:32:46,125
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

491
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:47,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else for your gaming week?

492
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:48,855
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not really.

493
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:49,675
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just getting ready.

494
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:54,197
[SPEAKER_12]: I was installing Arma 2 in the expansion, Daisy.

495
00:32:54,597 --> 00:33:03,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, because Gally had sent me a message on Twitter saying that he has a Daisy Breakpoint server.

496
00:33:04,301 --> 00:33:08,863
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe we could do that in a future VOG game night.

497
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:12,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, for now, I'm just suspending VOG game night because it's hard to get everybody together.

498
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:16,947
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just to think of games to play.

499
00:33:17,347 --> 00:33:18,368
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

500
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:45,927
[SPEAKER_12]: By some miracle, they fixed our Minecraft server long enough for me to download the backup of it.

501
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,927
[SPEAKER_12]: So I made a backup and downloaded the world.

502
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:50,908
[SPEAKER_12]: So we still have the world intact now.

503
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:55,529
[SPEAKER_12]: So my plan is when I do eventually get around to actually...

504
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Aw, that's just fantastic.

505
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:01,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Brad, you're awesome.

506
00:34:02,113 --> 00:34:07,136
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Brad from PodCulture sent me a copy of Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition.

507
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:08,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shut up.

508
00:34:08,357 --> 00:34:08,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now?

509
00:34:08,737 --> 00:34:08,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

510
00:34:09,017 --> 00:34:10,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

511
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:11,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

512
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:12,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad, you are too good to us.

513
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:13,760
[SPEAKER_04]: That man sends us booze.

514
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,261
[SPEAKER_04]: He sends us games.

515
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:16,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad, you're the man.

516
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:17,382
[SPEAKER_04]: He's awesome.

517
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And he sends me episodes of Doctor Who.

518
00:34:20,504 --> 00:34:23,966
[SPEAKER_04]: What else does a nerd need besides games, Doctor Who, and booze?

519
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:27,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Coffee!

520
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:28,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Coffee.

521
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad, you rock.

522
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody listen to PodCulture.

523
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,792
[SPEAKER_04]: 6 o'clock Pacific, Monday nights here at VOG.

524
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:52,586
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyway, the plan is, what I'm going to do with it once I get around to actually setting up that Minecraft server with mods and stuff, is I'm going to do a multi-world server where you can travel between the server that Gally has set up right now, which I think is a survival server, so I'm going to just leave that alone, and then ours, which is a...

525
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:57,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Creative servers, so you'll be able to go back and forth between that stuff, and I think it'll be the best of both worlds there.

526
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:01,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ruin the mood, but don't download that while the show's going.

527
00:35:02,255 --> 00:35:03,255
[SPEAKER_12]: No, of course not.

528
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:04,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, man.

529
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:05,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

530
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:09,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, going to the chat room, it's almost like it's a list list going on here.

531
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:14,165
[SPEAKER_04]: What else does a nerd need besides Doctor Who, liquor, and games?

532
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,167
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, boobs.

533
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:20,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a gay male and I'm not going to disagree with that.

534
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:21,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I need boobs too.

535
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:22,736
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

536
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:23,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes boobs get in the way.

537
00:35:26,383 --> 00:35:27,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I will co-sign that to the list.

538
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:29,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Fifth dream says masturbation.

539
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:54,271
[SPEAKER_04]: No comment Misty says Mountain Dew I don't know Nasty shit Maybe beverage of some type Coffee So a caffeinated beverage of some sort I will let caffeinated beverages go Except Mountain Dew is nasty shit Which by the way Rob I have to say something Speaking of nerd drinks Do you remember a soda called Josta?

540
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,234
[SPEAKER_04]: God, yes, it sounds familiar for some reason.

541
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And somebody brought a 15-year-old can of it.

542
00:36:15,461 --> 00:36:16,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I do remember this.

543
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:19,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody brought a 15-year-old can of it to California Extreme and you drank it.

544
00:36:19,524 --> 00:36:24,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I found a soda at the Russian market that tastes almost exactly like it.

545
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:26,210
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Brazilian Guarana soda.

546
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:30,934
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the most random thing you've ever said on this show.

547
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:32,415
[SPEAKER_08]: But Josta was made out of Guarana.

548
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:33,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, y'all, remember Josta?

549
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:36,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can get it at the Russian grocery store.

550
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:41,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind, I used to drink this stuff and watch Sailor Moon marathons.

551
00:36:42,023 --> 00:37:03,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Josta is the official drink of my Sailor Moon marathons so you can stop laughing at me alright so let me just add that to the list Doctor Who, boobs, game, liquor apparently Josta and Sailor Moon are on the list too well I'm glad that the Josta clone or whatever was more important than playing Mass Effect this week

552
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:10,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Now looking for houses is more... Which, by the way, the other... And by the way, it wasn't Russian, it was Brazilian, but it was a Brazilian soda at a Russian market.

553
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:23,864
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the other comment we got in chat, this is a little bit delayed here, but that the Gaben.tv song, the G-A-B-E-N.tv song, is appropriate for when Dark Sakura announces that she hasn't played Mass Effect for an entire week.

554
00:37:24,624 --> 00:37:26,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is supposed to be for the Steam sale.

555
00:37:28,786 --> 00:37:30,187
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also for you not playing it.

556
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you ready for a miracle?

557
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:37,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you ready for a miracle?

558
00:37:56,843 --> 00:37:58,504
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that song is going to play.

559
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:02,365
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what's going to happen when they play that song on Steam.

560
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:04,165
[SPEAKER_12]: It's when Half-Life 3 gets announced.

561
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:08,147
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just going to all of a sudden be like, hey, wait a second, this is from the Steam sale.

562
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:10,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, whoa, now hold on a second.

563
00:38:10,948 --> 00:38:11,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Something's different.

564
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:12,668
[SPEAKER_12]: He's not dressed.

565
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:17,070
[SPEAKER_12]: He's dressed up like a... I want that song played at my 40th birthday.

566
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:20,371
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow.

567
00:38:21,405 --> 00:38:22,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who you people are.

568
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:22,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm leaving.

569
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:23,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

570
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,473
[SPEAKER_04]: and listen to VOG on the TuneIn app, which you can do.

571
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:54,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you own an OUYA, I urge you, go get the TuneIn app and check out VOG because we are on TuneIn and you can listen to us through your OUYA.

572
00:38:56,043 --> 00:39:00,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I also played that parking valet simulator, the No Brakes Valet, whatever that's called.

573
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:01,369
[SPEAKER_04]: That game cracked me up.

574
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:01,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.

575
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:12,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing around with the Twitch TV app, which runs, I gotta say, it runs, no surprise, it's the exact same setup as the mobile Twitch TV, but it runs very well.

576
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't getting any screens that were entirely black, which I get a lot on mobile.

577
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:20,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I was getting a lot of good-looking feeds on Twitch TV, so that was pretty awesome.

578
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:21,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

579
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, as far as other games go, thank you Steam Sale.

580
00:39:25,753 --> 00:39:30,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought Scribblenauts Unlimited for $5 and I've been having fun with that.

581
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:40,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Scribblenauts, of course, is a puzzle game of sorts where you can type whatever object that comes to mind to help you solve the puzzle.

582
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:56,381
[SPEAKER_04]: for example I was in a museum level and I had to put things on the paintings that the people looking at them would appreciate so for example there might be a caveman so one thing that he might appreciate a campfire so you put in campfire and you put it in there

583
00:39:56,741 --> 00:40:03,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Scribblenauts Unlimited allows you to use the descriptive text so like you get an adjective, right?

584
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:18,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a red balloon or a red whatever or like I think I had a mission where the guy was going to go pick a girl up on a date and needed a cool ride so I said pink SUV and I got credit for it.

585
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:19,865
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have done DeLorean.

586
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's, yeah, that's true.

587
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:31,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the only, like, the only negative I can think of for Scribblenauts Unlimited is it's basically like a, it's more of a word puzzle than it is platformer puzzle, at least in the early levels.

588
00:40:31,432 --> 00:40:44,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Now granted, I'm still early on, I probably have like 16 stars total, so I'm not like super far into the game, but I've played it for an hour or two, and I imagine the puzzles get more complicated later on, and maybe there's not so much maybe platforming

589
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,641
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

590
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:12,999
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Cthulhu does.

591
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:13,720
[SPEAKER_08]: He's an Elder God.

592
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

593
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:15,722
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

594
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:16,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cute game.

595
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:20,588
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of an elaborate word puzzler.

596
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:25,954
[SPEAKER_04]: The first few levels you're going to be like kind of tapping your fingers on the desk like, okay, this is pretty easy.

597
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what I'm going to do when I get to that level.

598
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:29,198
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

599
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Little Red Corvette.

600
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:51,509
[SPEAKER_04]: and if it's driven by Prince it'll be even better I haven't really seen a sandbox stage I mean I guess you can always go back to the farm level and do whatever you want there but I was kind of surprised that like there isn't like well the first Scribblenauts game it was just a mode that you just go in the sandbox yeah I didn't I haven't really seen that in this so but anyway it was five bucks amazing

601
00:41:52,749 --> 00:42:19,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in chat says I summoned Cthulhu for a monster party you do see some funny stuff like in I think it was in the diner level in the basement there's some monsters that are dancing around and they want another person to dance with them so I summoned scary unicorn and it was a unicorn with a mask on that was scary it is really cool how the game really can translate like whatever you type into items and you can even build your own items which is pretty cool and edit stuff so yeah I was uh

602
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:46,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I was I there's there's still a lot of fun to be had in it even if the game itself is is pretty simple um otherwise other games I've been playing not a lot of new stuff uh still the Final Fantasy 14 beta which beta 3 finally ends this weekend okay here's how much I've played the Final Fantasy 14 beta you guys I actually got to the point where it said well that's all the story we have in the beta you have completed everything in the beta

603
00:42:48,613 --> 00:42:49,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Go home!

604
00:42:49,353 --> 00:42:53,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to that point in the story where it's like, look forward to the release of the game.

605
00:42:53,335 --> 00:42:54,056
[SPEAKER_04]: You beat the beta.

606
00:42:54,996 --> 00:42:57,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then, Shane's like, well, you could still go get your Chocobo.

607
00:42:57,717 --> 00:42:58,618
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not really done yet.

608
00:42:58,638 --> 00:42:59,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Go get your Chocobo.

609
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:00,859
[SPEAKER_04]: We got more instances to run.

610
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play it all this weekend, Rob.

611
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

612
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:08,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was... I think a lot of people are just kind of waiting for the release now.

613
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:11,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to save up the money so I can buy it.

614
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:16,246
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, they're going to nuke everybody pretty soon anyway, so it's like, eh, why am I going to waste that time?

615
00:43:16,486 --> 00:43:17,807
[SPEAKER_04]: But beta 4 should be in about...

616
00:43:18,827 --> 00:43:27,754
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 weeks or so and that supposedly is going to have the voice acting in the story quests and some other stuff too, it'll have more of the game oh there's voice acting in the game?

617
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:37,821
[SPEAKER_04]: for the main story quests there's going to be voice acting yeah I didn't know that until I read it I think on Reddit and it was out of a producer interview or something like that so I don't question its legitimacy

618
00:43:39,596 --> 00:43:41,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm loving Realm Reborn.

619
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:44,818
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such good fan service.

620
00:43:44,878 --> 00:43:46,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so well done.

621
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,201
[SPEAKER_04]: The first game, we don't acknowledge that anymore.

622
00:43:50,221 --> 00:43:51,662
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really what it should have been the whole time.

623
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:54,044
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what people want out of a Final Fantasy MMO, I think.

624
00:43:54,584 --> 00:44:01,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Some XI purists would probably argue with me on that, but I really think there's a lot of people that are going to be very happy with what Realm Reborn is doing.

625
00:44:01,828 --> 00:44:04,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I want, out of an MMO, Final Fantasy XI to go free-to-play.

626
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

627
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:10,837
[SPEAKER_04]: WhatUpG in chat asks, how many hours did you put in, Sky?

628
00:44:11,378 --> 00:44:12,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost count.

629
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a slash played?

630
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Easily 20.

631
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:15,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Easily.

632
00:44:18,106 --> 00:44:18,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably more.

633
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:23,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not just talking this weekend, I'm talking kind of comprehensive across the beta, but it's probably more.

634
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:31,312
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn on max graphics settings is amazing.

635
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:32,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Soundtrack is great too.

636
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:35,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, the soundtrack is phenomenal.

637
00:44:36,294 --> 00:44:41,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to be fair, the soundtrack was actually pretty good in 1.0, but a good soundtrack won't save a shitty game.

638
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:46,498
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's great that now there's this nice game that the soundtrack complements very well.

639
00:44:47,669 --> 00:44:48,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

640
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:07,472
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really it for my gaming week.

641
00:45:07,552 --> 00:45:08,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the Mii Plaza games.

642
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:10,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I played those quickly.

643
00:45:10,193 --> 00:45:12,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just say a couple of those I checked out.

644
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:23,459
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a space shooter type game where your Miis that you collect by street passing, the color of their shirts determines the weapons that you can place on your ship.

645
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:30,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have a red shirt as a flamethrower, a blue shirt as a homing missile, and then it's a little space shooter game.

646
00:45:30,283 --> 00:45:32,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an awesome little addition to Mii Plaza.

647
00:45:33,284 --> 00:45:38,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Bummer that they cost money, but they're decent games for, you know, what is it, $15 for the bundle?

648
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,231
[SPEAKER_04]: For four games?

649
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:41,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice little expansion.

650
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:43,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So, great.

651
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:53,123
[SPEAKER_04]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase COLOR.

652
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,526
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's it for our gaming weeks.

653
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:58,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can get into gaming news, but quickly I'm just going to say housekeeping.

654
00:45:59,069 --> 00:46:03,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget to add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and follow us on Facebook as well.

655
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Be our friend, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

656
00:46:07,035 --> 00:46:08,216
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also on Google+.

657
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:13,500
[SPEAKER_04]: All the places you can connect with us are located at our website, orangeloungeradio.com.

658
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:13,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

659
00:46:36,812 --> 00:46:41,978
[SPEAKER_12]: The only way that I would get into that is if it was conveniently timed with a game that I'm playing.

660
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:45,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm not going to really play a game, although I did for Super Meat Boy.

661
00:46:45,642 --> 00:46:46,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I did play the game.

662
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And you gave me your cards, so I'm more than happy with the way it turned out.

663
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:50,808
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what, though?

664
00:46:50,928 --> 00:46:54,412
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad that I did, because Super Meat Boy was an excellent game, and I do like it.

665
00:46:55,073 --> 00:46:55,734
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, you know...

666
00:46:55,894 --> 00:46:57,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great way to revisit games.

667
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:08,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't talk about it during my gaming week, but not only did I play Scribblenauts, I played Really Big Sky, I played Super Meat Boy, I played Magicka, I played... What else did I play to get cards out of?

668
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,579
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something else, too.

669
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:13,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's all these games I'm collecting cards in, and it forces me to go back and play the games again.

670
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:14,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

671
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:16,322
[SPEAKER_12]: So, anyways.

672
00:47:17,442 --> 00:47:17,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

673
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:22,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so how popular are these next-gen systems going to be?

674
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think they're going to be very popular.

675
00:47:24,228 --> 00:47:31,615
[SPEAKER_12]: And if anything, we should learn from these pre-orders that they are so popular that they're selling out of their allotments.

676
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:36,239
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, like any other console launch, they're going to be hard to find at launch.

677
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,281
[SPEAKER_12]: So, for example...

678
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:50,917
[SPEAKER_12]: GameStop, they've stopped taking pre-orders for the PlayStation 4 and they are also running short, I guess, on Xbox One systems, the Day 1 edition.

679
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:52,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

680
00:47:53,780 --> 00:48:03,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess, well, right now they are still selling some of the Xbox One bundles, but a lot of them are gone.

681
00:48:03,626 --> 00:48:05,107
[SPEAKER_12]: So they are almost out of those.

682
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:06,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, Amazon.

683
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:13,072
[SPEAKER_12]: They have stopped taking pre-orders for the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 launch bundles as well.

684
00:48:13,872 --> 00:48:14,212
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

685
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:22,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, probably the demand's been just very high for these things, so that's gotta be a good sign, unlike the Wii U.

686
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:26,464
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

687
00:48:26,644 --> 00:48:27,265
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have to see.

688
00:48:27,325 --> 00:48:36,489
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember there's still that rumor that they were having some problems making the problems with the yields from the chips for the Xbox One.

689
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:40,231
[SPEAKER_12]: So that could possibly lead to some shortages there.

690
00:48:40,611 --> 00:48:41,972
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see if there's anything to that.

691
00:48:42,472 --> 00:48:47,594
[SPEAKER_12]: But either way, it should be a very successful launch as far as console numbers go.

692
00:48:48,515 --> 00:48:51,016
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt says, of course there's going to be shortage.

693
00:48:51,036 --> 00:48:52,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to drive up demand as much as possible.

694
00:48:54,948 --> 00:48:59,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, yes, but I mean, honestly, I don't think they try to do it on purpose.

695
00:48:59,611 --> 00:49:03,613
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, granted, that's a wonderful side effect of, you know, the console being popular.

696
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:11,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Unlike, you know, I seriously think with the Wii and the Wii U or whatever, that they were shortening that stuff on purpose.

697
00:49:12,438 --> 00:49:20,502
[SPEAKER_12]: At least the Wii U, because I remember they were saying, oh, it's so impossible to find, and yet it was just sitting on shelves, like all these different places.

698
00:49:21,743 --> 00:49:23,924
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just kind of wonder about that stuff, but...

699
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:24,840
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

700
00:49:25,301 --> 00:49:40,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Once again, they're going to have to sell a lot of units to get the third-party support because if it's just not there, if they're not selling any units, then they're not going to sell games and they're going to lose support.

701
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:43,553
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to develop for systems that have the numbers.

702
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:44,974
[SPEAKER_04]: What systems would be left?

703
00:49:45,134 --> 00:49:46,014
[SPEAKER_04]: The 360 and PS3?

704
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:47,315
[SPEAKER_12]: You'd be surprised, yeah.

705
00:49:47,475 --> 00:49:49,277
[SPEAKER_12]: They would just develop for current-gen stuff.

706
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:51,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see in our chat room.

707
00:49:51,437 --> 00:49:55,119
[SPEAKER_04]: WhatUpG says, I think they are putting out more PlayStation 4 than Xbox One.

708
00:49:55,819 --> 00:50:01,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeon Buster says, in Microsoft's case, it could also be a continuing problem with silicon yields for their new CPU.

709
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:04,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Alchemy says, it's only on purpose when Nintendo does it.

710
00:50:05,762 --> 00:50:06,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.VogNetwork.com.

711
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:08,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, okay.

712
00:50:09,304 --> 00:50:14,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's why, and this is kind of going back to, how long were there shortages on the Wii?

713
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:16,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, over a year.

714
00:50:16,586 --> 00:50:17,766
[SPEAKER_12]: That's ridiculous.

715
00:50:17,986 --> 00:50:29,268
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, even with the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, there were shortages for maybe six months when they were catching up on the demand and stuff, but then they were able to keep up with it.

716
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:33,469
[SPEAKER_12]: But the Wii, it was hard to find just forever.

717
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:35,310
[SPEAKER_12]: It was ridiculous.

718
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:36,270
[SPEAKER_12]: And...

719
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:41,471
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, seeing the day to day operation of how Nintendo works.

720
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:50,806
[SPEAKER_12]: They do allocate a lot of stuff where they kind of hold back things that they could possibly sell and place them in certain places.

721
00:50:50,886 --> 00:51:01,234
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, there may be shortages for some retailers, but other retailers are getting product because they're filling the demand there first and shorting everybody else.

722
00:51:01,294 --> 00:51:07,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Or they're holding back because they don't want any extra units sitting on the shelves to make it seem like the system is selling out.

723
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:09,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

724
00:51:30,275 --> 00:51:33,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, way too early to still call a victor this year though, right?

725
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:34,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything can still happen.

726
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:46,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm, all I'm gonna say is Nintendo has got their work cut out for them to really sell those consoles because they're, you know, betting that these first party titles are gonna sell consoles and, and,

727
00:51:47,015 --> 00:51:47,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong.

728
00:51:47,536 --> 00:51:49,518
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Nintendo Mario games are great.

729
00:51:49,718 --> 00:51:52,000
[SPEAKER_04]: They do remain the cheapest option on the table.

730
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,261
[SPEAKER_12]: They are the cheapest option.

731
00:51:53,281 --> 00:52:00,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, speaking of cheap options, actually, I was going to say there is a PlayStation 3 SKU coming out next month for $199.

732
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:02,410
What?

733
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:03,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

734
00:52:04,092 --> 00:52:05,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, PlayStation 3, wow.

735
00:52:05,813 --> 00:52:06,234
[SPEAKER_12]: PlayStation 3.

736
00:52:06,274 --> 00:52:07,795
[SPEAKER_12]: That's still, wow, that's great.

737
00:52:08,576 --> 00:52:10,177
[SPEAKER_12]: However, the hard drive is really small.

738
00:52:10,217 --> 00:52:11,198
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a 12-gig hard drive.

739
00:52:11,218 --> 00:52:12,679
[SPEAKER_12]: They had it in Europe right now.

740
00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:13,400
[SPEAKER_12]: They were selling it.

741
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:18,404
[SPEAKER_12]: But a 12-gig hard drive for $199, that's still pretty cheap.

742
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:27,572
[SPEAKER_12]: And, I mean, granted, those hard drives are replaceable, and you can get a cheap hard drive, so it might be an easy way to get in if you want a PlayStation 3 system.

743
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:30,015
[SPEAKER_12]: So, there's that.

744
00:52:30,295 --> 00:52:32,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that might go through the holidays as well.

745
00:52:32,238 --> 00:52:32,858
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll help out.

746
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:37,444
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I mean, seriously, I hope that that Mario game does really well for them.

747
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:40,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that Mario game and Zelda and stuff really does sell systems for them.

748
00:52:40,488 --> 00:52:45,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if it doesn't, I don't know what more they can do.

749
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:46,336
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Mario Kart will be good, but...

750
00:52:47,938 --> 00:52:51,660
[SPEAKER_12]: They may be in the shitter for another year.

751
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:54,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think they're just going to stop.

752
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:58,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo themselves will not stop supporting Wii U. No, I understand.

753
00:52:58,504 --> 00:53:02,226
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll still see games that people are going to want on that for the next couple years.

754
00:53:02,506 --> 00:53:13,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, it may not be the powerhouse that the Wii was without all the other third-party support, but, I mean, Nintendo will still make games for their own system while they work on the successor.

755
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,274
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of games are, you know, Nintendo...

756
00:53:16,914 --> 00:53:20,196
[SPEAKER_12]: People that buy Nintendo systems a lot of times buy it for Nintendo games.

757
00:53:20,556 --> 00:53:28,661
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a huge loss, but it does affect if you want to buy a system or if you're contemplating buying another system.

758
00:53:29,302 --> 00:53:30,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's consider it next-gen.

759
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:34,325
[SPEAKER_12]: I still don't consider the Wii U next-gen because of the hardware and stuff.

760
00:53:35,525 --> 00:53:43,250
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're considering a next-gen system and you're looking at all the games that are coming out that I want to play and the Wii U is missing a lot of them,

761
00:53:45,041 --> 00:54:00,126
[SPEAKER_04]: you just might not buy the system and by the way just because I say Nintendo working on a successor I don't mean like they're hurrying a successor but it's very common that the research and development of these systems is years in advance PlayStation 5 is probably already being worked on

762
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:03,849
[SPEAKER_04]: very, very, very slowly in its early planning stages.

763
00:54:04,049 --> 00:54:15,498
[SPEAKER_12]: If the roadmaps are to be believed, the one that leaked out for the Xbox system and the Kinect and the VR stuff, Microsoft's working on some VR stuff.

764
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:16,899
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

765
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:19,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Next year is apparently when that's supposed to come out.

766
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:19,501
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

767
00:54:20,522 --> 00:54:21,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

768
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:30,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Microsoft, apparently, as Bobby likes to call them, the Microsoft space bucks, the Microsoft points, they're being phased out.

769
00:54:31,028 --> 00:54:33,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we kind of knew that that was going to be happening at some point.

770
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:40,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that came up during E3, but it is actually now kind of dated when that's all going to go down.

771
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:45,435
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Live rewards will be doing away with these bonuses as of August 1st.

772
00:54:47,877 --> 00:54:49,357
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX Live Rewards Program

773
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:15,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently some problems right now in the new dashboard build that's being previewed that's going to roll out in the fall.

774
00:55:16,274 --> 00:55:22,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess some problems there about some negative exchange rates and some that are too favorable.

775
00:55:23,739 --> 00:55:27,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Incorrect game title pricing in wrong regions and so forth.

776
00:55:27,582 --> 00:55:32,185
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it is a beta, so you can't exactly sit there and go, Microsoft, you suck.

777
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:35,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what you get when you sign up for a beta is that things are going to...

778
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:36,731
[SPEAKER_07]: We can still say they suck.

779
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:39,618
[SPEAKER_07]: We just can't say that that sucks.

780
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:41,663
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand how they can't, like,

781
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:47,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you telling me that Microsoft is confused on how their space bucks work?

782
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:54,054
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, granted, I know it's easy for the North American stuff where it's like 80 points equals a dollar.

783
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:58,175
[SPEAKER_12]: But in other regions, I'm sure it's X amount of points equals whatever.

784
00:55:58,535 --> 00:56:02,516
[SPEAKER_04]: With so much crap in the marketplace, though, I'm sure it's a database conversion issue.

785
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:06,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's one wrong little line of code that fucks everything up.

786
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it's something that simple.

787
00:56:08,297 --> 00:56:08,837
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be.

788
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:17,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, don't know yet exactly when the points will move into dollars, but it's gonna be before, probably this same September timeframe.

789
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:18,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And the 20 points thing?

790
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:19,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

791
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:20,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Before on your birthday?

792
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think I got that.

793
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Who, who, who even cares?

794
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:26,048
[SPEAKER_12]: That is just so ridiculously stupid.

795
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:27,149
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you buy with 20 points?

796
00:56:27,169 --> 00:56:32,572
[SPEAKER_12]: There was, uh, someone, I think it was... I think it was, um, uh...

797
00:56:33,773 --> 00:56:37,317
[SPEAKER_12]: and Flaco Jones who said, you know, hey, I got 20 points on my birthday.

798
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:39,179
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, don't spend it all in one place.

799
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,703
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you not spend it all in one place?

800
00:56:43,723 --> 00:56:44,764
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only 20 points.

801
00:56:45,745 --> 00:56:46,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.

802
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:47,527
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

803
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:48,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

804
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:48,909
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

805
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:50,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

806
00:56:51,808 --> 00:57:01,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know how we've talked about the poor sales of the Wii U are probably going to start affecting third-party markets as far as what gets developed for them?

807
00:57:02,317 --> 00:57:07,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it looks like Ubisoft has come out and said that they're not doing a sequel to Zombie U just for that reason.

808
00:57:08,422 --> 00:57:16,265
[SPEAKER_08]: That basically the Wii U hasn't sold enough and the game itself, Zombie U, hasn't sold enough.

809
00:57:16,865 --> 00:57:22,187
[SPEAKER_08]: So even though they have a prototype of a sequel, they are not going to pursue development.

810
00:57:22,668 --> 00:57:24,628
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be no Zombie U 2.

811
00:57:26,389 --> 00:57:28,890
[SPEAKER_08]: No Zombie The Edge, no Zombie Bono.

812
00:57:30,189 --> 00:57:34,794
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably going to be called something else, be my guess.

813
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:39,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's going to be multi-platform because that's why they can't, they know.

814
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:44,544
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's sad too because Zombie U is probably one of the most successful third-party games they had at launch.

815
00:57:45,404 --> 00:57:47,066
[SPEAKER_12]: I was really surprised by this news.

816
00:57:47,987 --> 00:57:48,868
[SPEAKER_12]: It was that bad.

817
00:57:48,988 --> 00:57:49,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Zombi-me.

818
00:57:49,288 --> 00:57:49,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Zombi-us.

819
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:18,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombie1!

820
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:27,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised to hear that it was that bad, but it also kind of shed some light on why they pulled the plug on the Rayman thing so fast.

821
00:58:27,428 --> 00:58:28,409
[SPEAKER_08]: It's exactly the same reason.

822
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:28,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

823
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:33,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because we didn't know this then, and we were kind of like, Ubisoft's just being dicks.

824
00:58:33,673 --> 00:58:37,375
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but I guess financially, that's what it is.

825
00:58:37,795 --> 00:58:41,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, well.

826
00:58:41,057 --> 00:58:45,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one time that Mr. Negative over there, Norman Negative, is right.

827
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:46,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

828
00:58:47,904 --> 00:58:48,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

829
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:49,966
[SPEAKER_04]: What else we got?

830
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:50,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up.

831
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:52,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha ha, Beatrageinator.

832
00:58:53,149 --> 00:58:53,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

833
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:55,311
[SPEAKER_08]: To my really awful U2 joke.

834
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:56,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Beat him with your shoe?

835
00:58:58,414 --> 00:58:59,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Zombie Bono.

836
00:58:59,856 --> 00:59:08,924
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, one of the things that PlayStation 4 was going to allow developers to do is self-publish on the PlayStation Network.

837
00:59:09,565 --> 00:59:12,047
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, basically their thought is, you know,

838
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:19,269
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to treat every single individual developer as a publisher as far as we're concerned.

839
00:59:19,629 --> 00:59:23,810
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't separate, we don't segregate indies from traditional publishers.

840
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I think is a fantastic thing.

841
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:32,792
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's awesome that you see these indie games next to big budget games and stuff.

842
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:40,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, it's kind of refreshing compared to the stuff that was happening with the Xbox indie games.

843
00:59:41,154 --> 00:59:41,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Where it's just like...

844
00:59:42,634 --> 00:59:43,535
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

845
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:04,508
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hoping that that also carries on over to the Vita as well because the Vita could always use more games.

846
01:00:19,235 --> 01:00:20,875
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX ONE XBOX ONE

847
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:46,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Microsoft's strategy with the Xbox One, or not even really with the Xbox because now they're kind of treating all their platforms as one platform.

848
01:00:47,502 --> 01:00:59,385
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the problem is they know that people want to develop games for the Xbox One, but they also know they have a lack of application support on Windows 8.

849
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:06,268
[SPEAKER_12]: So, their end is going to be basically, hey, develop games for the Windows 8 platform, and guess what?

850
01:01:06,308 --> 01:01:13,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we have that kernel running on, you know, or that version of the firmware, whatever, however you're going to split it up.

851
01:01:13,312 --> 01:01:15,052
[SPEAKER_12]: We have that running on the Xbox One.

852
01:01:15,093 --> 01:01:18,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Your games will be able to be ported over to the Xbox One very easily.

853
01:01:19,014 --> 01:01:21,116
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how they're going to win on both platforms, because...

854
01:01:22,196 --> 01:01:26,600
[SPEAKER_12]: They want to sell those operating systems because that's where they're probably going to make a lot of money.

855
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:32,285
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time, they also want to have stuff on their console.

856
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:35,908
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that's what they're going to try to do is try to get people almost like...

857
01:01:37,714 --> 01:01:43,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Trick them into making games for the Microsoft platform, I guess.

858
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:56,150
[SPEAKER_04]: ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, You have to worry about whether PlayStation Network on PS4 will turn into the App Store, though.

859
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:57,631
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.

860
01:01:57,751 --> 01:02:00,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the App Store has a lot of crap on it, like a lot of crap.

861
01:02:02,215 --> 01:02:04,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how many fart apps do we need, right?

862
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:06,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Flashlight apps, really.

863
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:07,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

864
01:02:08,906 --> 01:02:10,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's going to happen that way, though.

865
01:02:10,767 --> 01:02:22,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Because even right now with the way PlayStation Network's indie games are, it's easier for them to get on, but I don't think it's like they can just throw games up there like you can on the indie store and stuff.

866
01:02:23,477 --> 01:02:23,817
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

867
01:02:24,217 --> 01:02:25,298
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be interesting to see how they do it.

868
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:48,368
[SPEAKER_04]: All it was was pictures of Pokemon, but people legit thought it was like Nintendo's Pokemon on the App Store.

869
01:02:48,828 --> 01:02:51,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And people were downloading it like crazy and losing money on it.

870
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:55,373
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that they'll probably have some sort of review process in there.

871
01:02:55,573 --> 01:02:55,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

872
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,534
[SPEAKER_12]: You know...

873
01:02:59,095 --> 01:03:01,456
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll probably just, they have just a fun and happy medium.

874
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:05,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can't just make it super duper easy to put stuff on there.

875
01:03:05,397 --> 01:03:07,298
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, look at, like, for example, the Ouya.

876
01:03:07,398 --> 01:03:13,380
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a perfect example of how you can self-publish on there, but there's not a ton of stuff on there.

877
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,381
[SPEAKER_03]: That store's a mess, too, I gotta say.

878
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:18,202
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, well, that store has been a mess since launch, especially with their...

879
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:21,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Like fucked up like menus and stuff.

880
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:24,146
[SPEAKER_04]: The way to navigate that is it's not very well.

881
01:03:24,226 --> 01:03:30,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you know, you look at like all the different bars that feature things like every single one of them has got the same games in it, just in a different order.

882
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,973
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the Wii U store when it first launched or not too much different now.

883
01:03:35,782 --> 01:03:50,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so it's just kind of weird, but they do have it where you can easily publish stuff on there, but I think it's just some sort of quality sorting and stuff and just better ways to search for what you're actually looking for.

884
01:03:52,665 --> 01:04:00,708
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, you know, THQ had some problems last year and they went bankrupt and, you know, a lot of their properties went to all these different places.

885
01:04:00,808 --> 01:04:04,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence why, you know, we have Deep Silver doing Saints Row now and so forth.

886
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:14,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But Sega, apparently not happy with the way things went down because they filed a claim against THQ and bankruptcy court, of course, because THQ is bankrupt.

887
01:04:15,694 --> 01:04:39,090
[SPEAKER_04]: for almost a million dollars just shy of that about $941,000 that apparently is the amount that THQ received in pre-orders after Valve's cut for Company of Heroes 2 apparently Eurogamer had also reported that about a half million was made after THQ filed for bankruptcy so Sega wants to get that money back that came in from pre-orders for Company of Heroes 2

888
01:04:40,570 --> 01:05:03,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Double Fine, Codemasters, and other former THQ executives also looking for the money that they're supposed to be getting this doesn't mean any of them will get anything I imagine this is part of the process filing the claim so you can ultimately later on claim it as a loss when it comes to tax season later on but it's interesting that this THQ drama still goes on

889
01:05:04,003 --> 01:05:10,128
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the reason why Sega wants the money is because they got Relic, the developer, and the Company of Heroes property.

890
01:05:10,529 --> 01:05:14,692
[SPEAKER_04]: They bought that for $26.6 million at the THQ asset auction.

891
01:05:16,734 --> 01:05:17,655
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's going down.

892
01:05:17,715 --> 01:05:18,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega wants their money.

893
01:05:19,937 --> 01:05:21,738
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to buy their building back from Zynga.

894
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:23,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish.

895
01:05:24,926 --> 01:05:29,248
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they say, if we had a million dollars, we could make Dreamcast 2.

896
01:05:30,269 --> 01:05:35,231
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had a million dollars, maybe Sonic 4 wouldn't suck.

897
01:05:37,012 --> 01:05:41,314
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's funny the difference between what a million dollars is to you 10 years ago versus now.

898
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:41,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

899
01:05:42,695 --> 01:05:42,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

900
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:44,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm like, house!

901
01:05:44,656 --> 01:05:45,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I can buy a house!

902
01:05:47,157 --> 01:05:47,778
[SPEAKER_08]: League of Legends

903
01:06:02,695 --> 01:06:19,679
[SPEAKER_08]: It is now been considered, and this is a quote coming from Riot Games esports manager Nick Allen, said the United States government recognizes League of Legends pro players as professional athletes and awards visas to essentially work in the United States under that title.

904
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:29,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it is officially an esports and the pro players are ethletes, as I'm calling them.

905
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:31,802
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my new word and you have to give credit to me, ethlete.

906
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:33,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you suck at croquet?

907
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:00,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, actually I do.

908
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:05,653
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I cannot play croquet without singing Que Sera Sera to myself because of Heathers.

909
01:07:06,673 --> 01:07:08,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty good at miniature golf.

910
01:07:09,114 --> 01:07:11,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So am I. My husband's really good at it.

911
01:07:11,435 --> 01:07:11,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a sport?

912
01:07:11,975 --> 01:07:12,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Is mini golf a sport?

913
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,136
[SPEAKER_08]: It is officially in my universe.

914
01:07:14,336 --> 01:07:15,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well that's all I need.

915
01:07:15,216 --> 01:07:20,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've been talking about forming the Island of Awesome, and I think the national sport of the Island of Awesome should be mini golf.

916
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:31,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I honestly think that they should make mini golf courses the size of actual golf courses and televise that shit because I want to see someone doing a drive off of a giant loop-de-loop and all sorts of crazy stuff.

917
01:07:31,108 --> 01:07:34,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be right there with Dodgeball and League of Legends on the Ocho.

918
01:07:36,753 --> 01:07:37,674
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been 8, the 8th

919
01:08:00,054 --> 01:08:04,216
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have Blizzard, All Stars, Valve has Dota 2.

920
01:08:04,276 --> 01:08:05,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't there another one?

921
01:08:05,136 --> 01:08:06,357
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another one I'm not thinking of.

922
01:08:06,397 --> 01:08:07,397
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another smaller one.

923
01:08:07,778 --> 01:08:14,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, all those guys that contributed to the original Defense of the Ancients mod in Warcraft 3 all went their own separate ways.

924
01:08:14,641 --> 01:08:16,802
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got all these games because of it.

925
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:19,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Dota 2 going to be a sport?

926
01:08:19,743 --> 01:08:20,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what happens next?

927
01:08:21,504 --> 01:08:23,085
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you guys feel about... I still think we want Pro DDR.

928
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:26,342
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you guys feel about... But DDR's dead, yo.

929
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:27,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you got the memo?

930
01:08:27,182 --> 01:08:29,684
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

931
01:08:29,764 --> 01:08:32,125
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR... It's like the disco boys in Mystery Men.

932
01:08:32,165 --> 01:08:32,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Eddie Izzard.

933
01:08:33,306 --> 01:08:34,086
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR's life.

934
01:08:35,447 --> 01:08:36,027
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's death.

935
01:08:36,587 --> 01:08:38,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, after we're done playing.

936
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:41,970
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sweat playing chess.

937
01:09:05,263 --> 01:09:05,804
[SPEAKER_12]: In a hot room.

938
01:09:06,224 --> 01:09:07,505
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know.

939
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

940
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:09,847
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, fine.

941
01:09:11,469 --> 01:09:14,992
[SPEAKER_12]: But those people are... You're not going to see it in the fucking Olympics, okay?

942
01:09:15,513 --> 01:09:16,453
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not going to happen.

943
01:09:17,174 --> 01:09:18,956
[SPEAKER_12]: And don't even try to petition that shit.

944
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:21,158
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says it's called eSports.

945
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:22,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like new sports.

946
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:24,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Will we have the Olympics?

947
01:09:25,702 --> 01:09:26,743
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be actually kind of cool.

948
01:09:27,607 --> 01:09:37,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in chat says, how about stuff like Evo?

949
01:09:37,997 --> 01:09:39,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's all going on right now.

950
01:09:39,298 --> 01:09:41,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's a huge Olympics type of thing.

951
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,421
[SPEAKER_04]: That's only for fighting games.

952
01:09:43,001 --> 01:09:47,125
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, I mean, getting quite a bit of viewership and controversy of its own online.

953
01:09:47,445 --> 01:09:48,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll get into later in the show.

954
01:09:49,307 --> 01:09:49,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

955
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:51,955
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

956
01:10:13,722 --> 01:10:17,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Infinal in our chatroom says, Next, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics will be an eSport.

957
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:18,909
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very meta.

958
01:10:18,949 --> 01:10:19,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea.

959
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:20,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

960
01:10:21,332 --> 01:10:21,652
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

961
01:10:22,353 --> 01:10:24,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to release dates.

962
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:28,861
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to travel around the world and check out what games are coming out that could be a sport in a few years.

963
01:10:28,901 --> 01:10:29,442
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, Loki.

964
01:10:29,827 --> 01:10:38,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't know about any of the games you're going to support this week, but... Because, like, for example, there's Turbo Super Stunt Squad, which is a game based on the... Is it TurboTastic?

965
01:10:40,335 --> 01:10:40,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably not.

966
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:49,322
[SPEAKER_12]: It's based on that DreamWorks movie about the snail that somehow ingests NOS and so becomes, like, a super fast snail.

967
01:10:50,003 --> 01:10:51,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, that's science right there.

968
01:10:52,865 --> 01:10:55,407
[SPEAKER_12]: So they have that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360...

969
01:10:56,848 --> 01:10:59,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.

970
01:10:59,812 --> 01:11:09,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Also this week, your ever-yearly multi-release version of you versus a bunch of other feudal Japan warriors.

971
01:11:10,163 --> 01:11:15,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Dynasty Warriors 8 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

972
01:11:18,072 --> 01:11:21,796
[SPEAKER_12]: Also this week, Time and Eternity on PlayStation 3.

973
01:11:24,778 --> 01:11:28,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, the Serious Sam Collection being released on Xbox 360.

974
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:30,904
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a bunch of Xbox Live Arcade games that were on there.

975
01:11:32,065 --> 01:11:35,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say, I think that might be it.

976
01:11:36,029 --> 01:11:36,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I missing something?

977
01:11:40,312 --> 01:11:40,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

978
01:11:40,993 --> 01:11:42,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me move to Japan then.

979
01:11:43,075 --> 01:11:43,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, Rob.

980
01:11:44,697 --> 01:11:44,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

981
01:11:45,037 --> 01:11:45,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, I'm moving.

982
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:48,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving to the Japanese release dates.

983
01:11:48,861 --> 01:11:52,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIII 2 gets a price reduction on the PlayStation 3 on July 18th.

984
01:11:53,506 --> 01:12:00,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Shin Sangoku Mosou Online Z in regular edition and Treasure Box edition comes out on the 18th as well.

985
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:01,834
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Dynasty Warriors Online, right?

986
01:12:01,854 --> 01:12:02,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what that is.

987
01:12:03,696 --> 01:12:04,656
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on the PlayStation 3.

988
01:12:05,737 --> 01:12:07,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the Xbox 360.

989
01:12:07,218 --> 01:12:11,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIII 2 gets its reduction there too.

990
01:12:12,403 --> 01:12:15,505
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a digital contents version and Platinum Collection.

991
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:18,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I bet digital contents is just all the DLC.

992
01:12:18,388 --> 01:12:21,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Saw's side story and all the stuff that came out for XIII 2.

993
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,091
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of DLC for XIII 2.

994
01:12:23,231 --> 01:12:23,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

995
01:12:23,932 --> 01:12:24,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

996
01:12:25,013 --> 01:12:25,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't care about XIII 2?

01:12:26,574 --> 01:12:27,175

Cho Custom comes out this week from Level 5 There is a special Luigi Nintendo 3DS XL this week I don't know if it's like green or what the... I gotta see what this is Is it a green...

1000
01:13:23,587 --> 01:13:26,049
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S doesn't try and import one of these.

1001
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:53,883
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1002
01:13:54,903 --> 01:13:55,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he will.

1003
01:13:56,364 --> 01:14:05,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on the 3DS this week, Shin Sekaiju no Mikyu Design Skins.

1004
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:07,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Those aren't even games.

1005
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are just little skins for the 3DS.

1006
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:14,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Osahari Hamster 2 Korosau Isho ni Orokake comes out this week.

1007
01:14:16,295 --> 01:14:17,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Do something together.

1008
01:14:18,756 --> 01:14:20,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Play with adorable hamsters.

1009
01:14:20,476 --> 01:14:21,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, it's hamster sim.

1010
01:14:21,477 --> 01:14:22,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's let's play together.

1011
01:14:22,777 --> 01:14:23,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, the box.

1012
01:14:24,337 --> 01:14:25,177
[SPEAKER_04]: This is adorable.

1013
01:14:25,237 --> 01:14:26,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we get games like this here?

1014
01:14:26,898 --> 01:14:28,478
[SPEAKER_07]: They're on a sunflower.

1015
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:30,619
[SPEAKER_04]: The hamsters are sitting on a sunflower.

1016
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:31,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Wearing bows.

1017
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:32,919
[SPEAKER_04]: One is wearing a tiara.

1018
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:34,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you look at the game shots.

1019
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:49,967
[SPEAKER_04]: and like they're playing in this like cherry blossom field with a little hamster wheel and then there's one underwater here and then here's one with the hamsters they're just chilling at the beach this little chief hamster there sitting in a lounge chair just chilling at the beach

1020
01:14:50,327 --> 01:14:51,348
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not realistic at all.

1021
01:14:51,428 --> 01:14:56,791
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, if they were in that field of flowers... Well, they're not going to have Richard Gere's asshole as a level, Loki.

1022
01:14:56,811 --> 01:14:57,532
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I understand that.

1023
01:14:57,552 --> 01:14:59,133
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying that they do that.

1024
01:14:59,153 --> 01:15:00,974
[SPEAKER_08]: They'd be like running from owls level.

1025
01:15:01,014 --> 01:15:06,538
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying that they would just need to be there, and they would just shove in their face full of food, because that's all hamsters do, is shove in their face full of food.

1026
01:15:07,238 --> 01:15:11,741
[SPEAKER_12]: They throw their poop, actually, because they like to keep their cage clean, so they huck it like footballs.

1027
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:13,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And they pee on you when they're nervous.

1028
01:15:14,548 --> 01:15:14,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1029
01:15:17,891 --> 01:15:21,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma is pointing out that he's not interested in this 3DS XL because it's region locked.

1030
01:15:22,314 --> 01:15:23,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?

1031
01:15:23,455 --> 01:15:32,662
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to find a way to un-region lock Osahara Hamster to Koraso Isho ni Odakake because, again, here's the game.

1032
01:15:32,882 --> 01:15:35,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it says, like, let's play together.

1033
01:15:36,235 --> 01:15:38,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a game that we need in America.

1034
01:15:38,657 --> 01:15:40,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we have this game in America?

1035
01:15:40,539 --> 01:15:47,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo's fascist state 3DS will not allow me to import this game.

1036
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,926
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a challenge to all our listeners now.

1037
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:52,650
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a hamster, I want you to put a bow on it and send me a picture.

1038
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,451
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep the hamster's... Oh my God, don't harm the hamster.

1039
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:57,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't glue it to the hamster's head, you know, like... Or what do they do?

1040
01:15:57,254 --> 01:15:59,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Staple it to the hamster's... Safety first.

1041
01:15:59,576 --> 01:16:00,276
[SPEAKER_07]: In Scrooged?

1042
01:16:00,296 --> 01:16:01,958
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be this great.

1043
01:16:02,478 --> 01:16:06,720
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, I want to see... Or you can Photoshop a tiara onto your hamster.

1044
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see your glammed-up hamsters.

1045
01:16:10,142 --> 01:16:11,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Photoshop DarkSakura's face.

1046
01:16:11,863 --> 01:16:12,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Photoshop DarkSakura's face.

1047
01:16:12,883 --> 01:16:14,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Glamsters, yes.

1048
01:16:14,104 --> 01:16:14,544
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1049
01:16:14,944 --> 01:16:16,285
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the game that we need, Rob.

1050
01:16:16,325 --> 01:16:16,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

1051
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:17,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a dream game?

1052
01:16:17,585 --> 01:16:18,586
[SPEAKER_08]: OLR dream game.

1053
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:19,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Glamsters.

1054
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:20,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Glamsters.

1055
01:16:21,947 --> 01:16:22,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

1056
01:16:22,768 --> 01:16:23,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

1057
01:16:23,308 --> 01:16:23,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, yes.

1058
01:16:23,888 --> 01:16:25,229
[SPEAKER_12]: There have been games...

1059
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:26,609
[SPEAKER_12]: by Activision.

1060
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:30,931
[SPEAKER_12]: There's actually, I believe, like a Pets Hamsters with a Z in there.

1061
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:34,752
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have had games where it's Pets fashion where you actually do dress up.

1062
01:16:34,933 --> 01:16:36,413
[SPEAKER_12]: It is not that cute.

1063
01:16:36,473 --> 01:16:37,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I beg to differ, Loki.

1064
01:16:37,574 --> 01:16:38,974
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also a Hamtaro game.

1065
01:16:40,074 --> 01:16:46,577
[SPEAKER_08]: But not like little CG actual looking hamsters that are adorable that wear bows and tiaras and go to the beach.

1066
01:16:47,688 --> 01:16:52,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Photoshop of a hamster with a crown on a beach chair.

1067
01:16:53,795 --> 01:16:54,495
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my challenge.

1068
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:56,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I could do it myself, but I'm lazy.

1069
01:16:56,277 --> 01:17:03,005
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to... No, this is a whole President Cat thing going on here because who made this?

1070
01:17:03,245 --> 01:17:03,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Who made this?

1071
01:17:03,906 --> 01:17:04,807
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to start harassing them.

1072
01:17:04,827 --> 01:17:05,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Nipong Columbia, yes.

1073
01:17:05,928 --> 01:17:07,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I want their Twitter harassed.

1074
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,792
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're going to call this game Glamsters is the U.S.

1075
01:17:10,812 --> 01:17:12,133
[SPEAKER_04]: localization title.

1076
01:17:12,813 --> 01:17:14,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want Glamsters.

1077
01:17:14,455 --> 01:17:15,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what it translates to.

1078
01:17:15,876 --> 01:17:16,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1079
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:17,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Glamsters.

1080
01:17:17,997 --> 01:17:20,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want Glamsters in the U.S.

1081
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:24,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, the name is essentially playing with hamsters or playing together with hamsters.

1082
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:27,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Glamsters.

1083
01:17:30,306 --> 01:17:30,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Who made this?

1084
01:17:30,826 --> 01:17:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Nippon Columbia.

1085
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:33,108
[SPEAKER_04]: What's their Twitter?

1086
01:17:34,188 --> 01:17:35,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Oil Army, get to work.

1087
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:36,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring me a Twitter.

1088
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:36,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.

1089
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,821
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 14th, which is what today?

1090
01:18:10,515 --> 01:18:10,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it now?

1091
01:18:11,095 --> 01:18:11,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1092
01:18:11,956 --> 01:18:13,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Mega Man Unlimited for PC.

1093
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:18,200
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 16th, Momotokun Curse on PlayStation 3.

1094
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,721
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 18th, Plants vs. Zombies 2.

1095
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:21,682
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about time.

1096
01:18:23,143 --> 01:18:24,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And that wasn't me saying that.

1097
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:24,924
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually the title.

1098
01:18:26,044 --> 01:18:26,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?

1099
01:18:27,865 --> 01:18:28,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm spent.

1100
01:18:29,607 --> 01:18:31,648
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm surprised Mega Man Unlimited was listed on there.

1101
01:18:31,668 --> 01:18:32,688
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a fan game.

1102
01:18:32,748 --> 01:18:33,529
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a fan game.

1103
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:34,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of surprised that's on there.

1104
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:37,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's on there, so good for them.

1105
01:18:38,472 --> 01:18:38,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1106
01:18:39,264 --> 01:18:41,366
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1107
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:17,740
[SPEAKER_12]: As a precautionary measure, they basically said that credit card information was not stored on the server, and they weren't sure what was taken during the breach, or if anything.

1108
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:24,326
[SPEAKER_12]: But basically, all the stored passwords were encrypted, and they're saying it's very unlikely anything can be done with the passwords.

1109
01:19:24,446 --> 01:19:28,510
[SPEAKER_12]: But they've reset them, so you've got to make a new one anyways.

1110
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:28,950
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1111
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:34,435
[SPEAKER_12]: And Konami has also been hacked as well.

1112
01:19:34,475 --> 01:19:43,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Konami's ID portal website had a large batch of unauthorized logins, I guess, during the month of June.

1113
01:19:44,843 --> 01:19:51,509
[SPEAKER_12]: And basically saying that it's exposed some customer information and they recommend changing your passports.

1114
01:19:52,529 --> 01:19:52,810
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

1115
01:19:54,531 --> 01:20:04,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and apparently also the information that may have been exposed, customer names, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, email addresses, and that's it.

1116
01:20:05,965 --> 01:20:06,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Change your passwords.

1117
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:10,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Hackers gonna hack.

1118
01:20:11,532 --> 01:20:11,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1119
01:20:13,152 --> 01:20:20,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope your password that you used on these websites was not the same that you used on your bank website because that would have been a really bad idea.

1120
01:20:21,378 --> 01:20:25,040
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why these things get hacked for people that use the same password everywhere.

1121
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:31,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe you'll see Glamsters on the show floor at Tokyo Game Show.

1122
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:36,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you won't because it's already out in Japan, but we can still dream it will still show up at Tokyo Game Show.

1123
01:20:36,728 --> 01:20:40,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Tokyo Game Show had its list of exhibitors announced this week.

1124
01:20:40,871 --> 01:20:42,251
[SPEAKER_04]: When is Tokyo Game Show?

1125
01:20:42,312 --> 01:20:42,872
[SPEAKER_04]: October-ish?

1126
01:20:43,453 --> 01:20:44,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually September.

1127
01:20:45,077 --> 01:20:45,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is September.

1128
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:51,734
[SPEAKER_04]: The Exhibitor list is out and Microsoft's on it, which is a bit of a surprise because the Xbox One...

1129
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:53,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you laughing over there?

1130
01:20:53,970 --> 01:21:01,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, we got all these cool things to show you that we're not releasing this year because the Xbox One's not coming to your region because you're second tier.

1131
01:21:01,313 --> 01:21:04,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox One coming to the second tier country of Japan.

1132
01:21:06,334 --> 01:21:15,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I don't say that to be offensive, but the reality is that since Japan didn't support the first Xbox... Do they have cosplay at Tokyo Game Show?

1133
01:21:15,657 --> 01:21:15,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1134
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:16,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1135
01:21:16,457 --> 01:21:19,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Good, someone can cosplay at Tumbleweed and maybe roll through the booth.

1136
01:21:20,816 --> 01:21:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You're such an ass.

1137
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:28,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft also going to be going to Gamescom if anyone's keeping track of that.

1138
01:21:28,761 --> 01:21:29,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it'll be interesting.

1139
01:21:30,102 --> 01:21:38,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, folks at Tokyo Game Show, Sony, Capcom, EA, Sega, Squeenix, Konami, Namco Bandai, Tecmo Koei, Bethesda.

1140
01:21:39,087 --> 01:21:40,688
[SPEAKER_04]: All those folks are going to be at Tokyo Game Show.

1141
01:21:40,728 --> 01:21:41,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess who's not there?

1142
01:21:42,049 --> 01:21:42,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're never there.

1143
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:44,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo.

1144
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo will not be there.

1145
01:21:45,551 --> 01:21:46,891
[SPEAKER_04]: But they never do Tokyo Game Show.

1146
01:21:47,412 --> 01:21:49,212
[SPEAKER_04]: They usually do their own thing that same week.

1147
01:21:50,033 --> 01:21:51,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're Nintendo and that's what they do.

1148
01:21:54,134 --> 01:22:00,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with a comment on the hacking article saying it is Konami's own fault they were hacked.

1149
01:22:00,877 --> 01:22:03,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Their code was up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

1150
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:09,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Shouldn't use the same code in every game that you make.

1151
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's different in Proteus.

1152
01:22:12,789 --> 01:22:14,270
[SPEAKER_04]: It was backwards.

1153
01:22:37,475 --> 01:22:39,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Respect this game or get out of my planet.

1154
01:22:40,337 --> 01:22:40,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1155
01:22:40,777 --> 01:22:41,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Off my planet.

1156
01:22:41,758 --> 01:22:43,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Get off my patalandia.

1157
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:46,000
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1158
01:22:46,481 --> 01:22:46,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Pinbot.

1159
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:48,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, good choice.

1160
01:22:48,482 --> 01:22:48,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1161
01:22:49,142 --> 01:22:50,343
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's actually not the table.

1162
01:22:50,443 --> 01:22:52,424
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the NES game that Rare developed.

1163
01:22:52,524 --> 01:22:53,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent choice.

1164
01:22:54,646 --> 01:22:56,787
[SPEAKER_04]: The game came out in... Crap, I didn't link the YouTube.

1165
01:22:56,987 --> 01:22:57,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Rob.

1166
01:22:57,808 --> 01:22:59,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, it'll take me a minute to get the audio.

1167
01:22:59,289 --> 01:23:01,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody, I'm sorry for Rob.

1168
01:23:01,786 --> 01:23:02,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1169
01:23:02,647 --> 01:23:03,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for you.

1170
01:23:03,847 --> 01:23:05,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry for your face.

1171
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:06,189
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

1172
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:08,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, epic rare soundtrack.

1173
01:23:08,731 --> 01:23:10,532
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I didn't know I didn't have such good music.

1174
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we just listen to this for a minute?

1175
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:12,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1176
01:23:12,194 --> 01:23:13,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to hear you talk.

1177
01:23:13,534 --> 01:23:14,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to hear this.

1178
01:23:14,695 --> 01:23:14,935
[SPEAKER_08]: You what?

1179
01:23:14,976 --> 01:23:15,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Head face.

1180
01:23:22,766 --> 01:23:25,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, sexy lady pinball.

1181
01:23:25,469 --> 01:23:28,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I like her electro moves.

1182
01:23:28,972 --> 01:23:30,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I suppose you can talk now.

1183
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:36,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, the game came out in North America in 1990, and it was a version of the same pinball machine that Williams did in 1986.

1184
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:46,447
[SPEAKER_08]: The NES version actually has most of the stuff from the machine, and graphically is pretty darn accurate, I think.

1185
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:54,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how they even have the Williams logo at the bottom and how they did the scores where the normal price things are.

1186
01:23:56,219 --> 01:23:58,642
[SPEAKER_08]: So the point really is just to get points.

1187
01:23:59,724 --> 01:24:01,646
[SPEAKER_08]: You start off with your marker set on Pluto.

1188
01:24:02,087 --> 01:24:04,370
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go through the solar system by hitting different targets.

1189
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:10,052
[SPEAKER_08]: and different checkpoint planets give you specials so you get extra balls that way.

1190
01:24:10,532 --> 01:24:13,373
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you reach the sun you get a super special so you get another extra ball.

1191
01:24:14,994 --> 01:24:21,396
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the visor too which basically works exactly like it does in the arcade machine.

1192
01:24:21,476 --> 01:24:27,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure, I really hope most of you have played the legit for reals pinball, I mean pinbot before.

1193
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:37,067
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have a 5x5 grid that has drop targets, and once you've hit them, the grid lights, the visor opens, and you can lock the balls there to start your multiball.

1194
01:24:37,147 --> 01:24:38,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this game, it is a double multiball.

1195
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:45,334
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can also re-lock balls while they're in multiball and get extra points.

1196
01:24:46,074 --> 01:25:00,508
[SPEAKER_08]: So with this, basically, to get such a long playfield, it actually crops it where your flippers are and the top screen moves until it reconnects to wherever it would be once they're joined.

1197
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the ramps.

1198
01:25:03,351 --> 01:25:04,392
[SPEAKER_08]: It has everything.

1199
01:25:04,512 --> 01:25:06,694
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is about the best.

1200
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:16,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, other than now, like on pin name or something, it really is probably... It was the only good version of this game you could get at home, apart from owning the table.

1201
01:25:17,684 --> 01:25:20,626
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, I mean, I'll sit and play this sometimes, too.

1202
01:25:21,207 --> 01:25:29,052
[SPEAKER_08]: And one good thing about this, too, is that, um, it actually has, um, some of the synthesized speech from the game.

1203
01:25:30,133 --> 01:25:33,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, although it pauses the game to play the speech.

1204
01:25:34,356 --> 01:25:37,278
[SPEAKER_08]: It has most of the music, the sound effects.

1205
01:25:37,338 --> 01:25:38,518
[SPEAKER_08]: You can turn them on and off.

1206
01:25:40,179 --> 01:25:42,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Your pause is on your second controller.

1207
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:45,842
[SPEAKER_08]: The first can't because you use start and select as your nudge.

1208
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:47,903
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, make sure you don't tilt.

1209
01:25:50,874 --> 01:26:00,645
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people really, really liked it because it is a faithful rendition, but there are people who did not like the enemies and hazards on the playfield as they were not in the original.

1210
01:26:01,105 --> 01:26:12,258
[SPEAKER_08]: They did rare reuse the game engine to do high speed, which was also based off of Steve Ritchie's High Speed, but it was published by Tradewest.

1211
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:33,713
[SPEAKER_08]: by the way, Steve Ritchie is a really cool guy he did the voices for Black Knight for No Fear and he's just a really cool dude I want to do voices on a pinball game be fun stop shaking the table

1212
01:26:36,286 --> 01:26:37,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob's game would be called Girl Please.

1213
01:26:38,528 --> 01:26:39,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitch, please!

1214
01:26:41,111 --> 01:26:49,020
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, as far as other pinball games that came out on the NES, there was Pinball, Rollerball, Rock'n'Ball, and Pinball Quest.

1215
01:26:51,142 --> 01:26:54,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I really think that Pinbot is the brightest on the list.

1216
01:26:55,489 --> 01:26:59,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball Quest is one of those games you kind of remember through rose-colored glasses.

1217
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:01,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oh man, Pinball Quest was awesome.

1218
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:06,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you go back and play it and you're like, god, it was... It had so many bugs and issues, though.

1219
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:07,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not good.

1220
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:09,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Pinbot is just solid.

1221
01:27:09,797 --> 01:27:12,958
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a testament, I think, to early Rare games.

1222
01:27:13,058 --> 01:27:13,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Rollerball wasn't bad.

1223
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:15,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Rollerball wasn't bad at all.

1224
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,681
[SPEAKER_04]: You forgot the actual game called Pinball from Nintendo.

1225
01:27:18,701 --> 01:27:19,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was Pinball.

1226
01:27:20,122 --> 01:27:22,323
[SPEAKER_08]: But I still think that Pinbot's the best of the batch.

1227
01:27:22,383 --> 01:27:22,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I agree.

1228
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:26,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Rollerball was also... I thought there was one other I'm not thinking of.

1229
01:27:27,286 --> 01:27:28,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what's funny.

1230
01:27:28,247 --> 01:27:33,950
[SPEAKER_08]: The actual table for Rollerball was the first game I played when I got to the expo.

1231
01:27:34,951 --> 01:27:36,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know it was a real table.

1232
01:27:37,232 --> 01:27:41,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like... Was it like four screens tall or something?

1233
01:27:41,655 --> 01:27:41,855
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1234
01:27:43,536 --> 01:27:44,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm thinking of a different game.

1235
01:27:45,618 --> 01:27:46,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe it was Roller Games.

1236
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:47,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Roller Games is one of them.

1237
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:48,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think you're blending those.

1238
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:52,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think Roller Ball on NES was like a four screen tall table.

1239
01:27:52,062 --> 01:27:52,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.

1240
01:27:52,442 --> 01:27:53,543
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking of Roller Games.

1241
01:27:53,763 --> 01:27:54,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1242
01:27:55,224 --> 01:27:58,466
[SPEAKER_08]: You know which one I always wish I would have had a release like that?

1243
01:27:58,546 --> 01:27:59,247
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Hyper Ball.

1244
01:28:00,247 --> 01:28:06,311
[SPEAKER_08]: The one where you have the major multiballs and all you do is shoot pinballs all day and all night until you hit these little side targets.

1245
01:28:08,212 --> 01:28:09,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Hyper Ball would have been fun, I think.

1246
01:28:09,793 --> 01:28:09,913
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1247
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:11,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Digress.

1248
01:28:11,934 --> 01:28:12,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Pinbot.

1249
01:28:12,735 --> 01:28:13,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Classic.

1250
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:15,856
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't go wrong with Pinbot.

1251
01:28:17,216 --> 01:28:17,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1252
01:28:17,856 --> 01:28:24,018
[SPEAKER_08]: And if anyone ever thinks to get a classic table, Pinbot makes a great start and it makes really good for trading up later.

1253
01:28:25,219 --> 01:28:25,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is.

1254
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:26,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week.

1255
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinbot for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1256
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,400
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorites.

1257
01:28:30,341 --> 01:28:31,381
[SPEAKER_04]: A non-Sega game.

1258
01:28:31,401 --> 01:28:32,681
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1259
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:34,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I do non-Sega games all the time.

1260
01:28:34,582 --> 01:28:35,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done Compile.

1261
01:28:35,742 --> 01:28:37,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-Sega slash non-Termographics game.

1262
01:28:38,003 --> 01:28:38,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done Irem.

1263
01:28:39,104 --> 01:28:39,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, no.

1264
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:40,204
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good times.

1265
01:28:40,724 --> 01:28:44,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks in chat reminiscing about some of the portable pinball games that were really good.

1266
01:28:44,508 --> 01:28:46,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Fifth Dream says Pokemon pinball owned.

1267
01:28:47,391 --> 01:28:50,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf says I enjoyed Metroid Prime pinball in the DS.

1268
01:28:50,113 --> 01:28:53,216
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the game that was on the original Game Boy?

1269
01:28:53,276 --> 01:28:54,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it Revenge of the Gator?

1270
01:28:55,138 --> 01:28:57,180
[SPEAKER_08]: That one was fun.

1271
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Revenge of the Gator was great.

1272
01:28:58,641 --> 01:29:00,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I would stay up all night playing that damn game.

1273
01:29:00,403 --> 01:29:01,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember playing that in 7th grade.

1274
01:29:01,644 --> 01:29:03,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you a Revenge of the Gator fan, Bradley?

1275
01:29:06,221 --> 01:29:07,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, your mic cut out.

1276
01:29:07,463 --> 01:29:08,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

1277
01:29:08,084 --> 01:29:10,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it came off the end there.

1278
01:29:11,228 --> 01:29:13,230
[SPEAKER_10]: I was saying something even earlier than these games.

1279
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:22,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it was based on any real pinball table, but there was a pinball on the Atari 2600, like Midnight Magic or something like that.

1280
01:29:22,822 --> 01:29:23,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1281
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Atari had one of their own too.

1282
01:29:25,784 --> 01:29:27,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was like a really basic sort of thing.

1283
01:29:28,246 --> 01:29:34,751
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorite Commodore 64 games ever was Pinball Construction Set by ECA.

1284
01:29:35,052 --> 01:29:36,513
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what EA used to be back in the day.

1285
01:29:36,533 --> 01:29:37,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It was ECA.

1286
01:29:37,434 --> 01:29:39,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball Construction Set was awesome.

1287
01:29:39,735 --> 01:29:51,725
[SPEAKER_04]: It was literally build your own damn pinball table, but people would, you know, there was no internet really back then, but you would disc trade with people and get their pinball tables and you could find some pretty epic stuff out there.

1288
01:29:52,365 --> 01:29:52,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

1289
01:29:54,506 --> 01:29:56,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of props for Revenge of the Gator in our chatroom.

1290
01:29:56,768 --> 01:29:57,908
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf says, I loved it.

1291
01:29:58,448 --> 01:30:00,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, Revenge of the Gator was godly.

1292
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:03,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew BlackWolf would remember Pinball Construction set.

1293
01:30:03,851 --> 01:30:04,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew he would.

1294
01:30:04,712 --> 01:30:05,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew he would.

1295
01:30:06,053 --> 01:30:06,513
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1296
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:07,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1297
01:30:09,051 --> 01:30:16,974
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was actually just thinking that it would be cool if, you know, because you know, like, there's actually a pinball table for Rollercoaster Tycoon.

1298
01:30:18,274 --> 01:30:21,095
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be cool if they did, like, SimPin now.

1299
01:30:21,955 --> 01:30:25,957
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, where it's, you build your pinball tables and then put them out on, um...

1300
01:30:27,737 --> 01:30:35,199
[SPEAKER_08]: and on something like Steam, you have the creator and you put your tables up for other people to download and compare and rate.

1301
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:39,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how about just freaking pinball construction set, but like, you know.

1302
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:45,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that the game you were thinking of was called David's Midnight Magic, wasn't it?

1303
01:30:46,921 --> 01:30:50,642
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there was a Midnight Magic for Atari 2600, but there was also a David's Midnight Magic.

1304
01:30:51,713 --> 01:30:53,094
[SPEAKER_04]: See, here's the pinball construction set.

1305
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:56,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if there's actual music or if there's somebody talking in this clip here on YouTube.

1306
01:30:56,875 --> 01:31:03,859
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you can see that they're putting together their little pinball table, and they put up little ramps, and all the stuff you use to build it's over there on the side.

1307
01:31:03,899 --> 01:31:06,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And then let's see if we actually see a finished table here.

1308
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:07,801
[SPEAKER_08]: It was David's Midnight Magic.

1309
01:31:07,821 --> 01:31:09,822
[SPEAKER_08]: There was also a Commodore 64 version, Rob.

1310
01:31:10,722 --> 01:31:10,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1311
01:31:11,122 --> 01:31:12,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was on the Atari computers.

1312
01:31:13,403 --> 01:31:15,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Atari 2600 version was just called Midnight Magic.

1313
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:15,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1314
01:31:19,656 --> 01:31:20,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1315
01:31:20,497 --> 01:31:23,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1316
01:31:24,019 --> 01:31:26,341
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got more of Orange Launch Radio to come after the break.

1317
01:31:26,461 --> 01:31:27,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, Crewball.

1318
01:31:27,962 --> 01:31:29,023
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awful.

1319
01:31:29,423 --> 01:31:30,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Crewball, apparently.

1320
01:31:30,764 --> 01:31:41,852
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mailbag, the Fugle Question of the Week, your phone calls, and some more stories, including, yes, we're going to talk about that little controversy that went down between Nintendo and Evo, and speaking of Nintendo, a possible new franchise for them next year.

1321
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:46,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk all about that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1322
01:31:53,117 --> 01:31:59,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there, this is Elliot B, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1323
01:31:59,802 --> 01:32:06,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.

1324
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:09,669
[SPEAKER_01]: It has musical apes fighting reptilian pirates.

1325
01:32:10,109 --> 01:32:11,270
[SPEAKER_01]: What more could you ask for?

1326
01:32:13,407 --> 01:32:13,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Boobs.

1327
01:32:14,968 --> 01:32:21,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 512, July the 14th of 2013.

1328
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:30,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks to Elliot there for the bumper, even though that's the second time y'all have heard it, because I don't have any new bumpers to play, so I think you guys need to fix that.

1329
01:32:30,413 --> 01:32:37,175
[SPEAKER_04]: For more information about sending a bumper to Orange Lounge Radio, check out vognetwork.com, and the forums has all the information there in Orange Lounge Radio.

1330
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:39,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything you need to know there.

1331
01:32:41,016 --> 01:32:49,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing the new Find Me games during the break because I street passed with Bradley, who's sitting here in studio tonight, and I also street passed with DarkSakura.

1332
01:32:49,740 --> 01:33:02,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, one thing I noticed about this Warriors Way, which I'm still trying to figure this game out, it's basically like you have troops, and the troops number is based on the number of people you've had ever in your plaza.

1333
01:33:02,626 --> 01:33:09,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I street passed with a friend of mine that does some of the shadow casting for movies here locally, and he's like, dude, Robb,

1334
01:33:10,109 --> 01:33:14,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you gave me 700 people for my army in Warrior's Way.

1335
01:33:14,415 --> 01:33:17,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you know, I've been to E3 and all this stuff.

1336
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:19,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've picked up quite a few people.

1337
01:33:19,883 --> 01:33:21,064
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, you helped me beat a level.

1338
01:33:21,084 --> 01:33:21,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, cool.

1339
01:33:21,986 --> 01:33:22,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, all right, I'm awesome.

1340
01:33:22,987 --> 01:33:23,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a big army.

1341
01:33:24,089 --> 01:33:26,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just street passed you with Brad who came into Warrior's Way.

1342
01:33:29,253 --> 01:33:29,974
[SPEAKER_04]: 25,000 people?

1343
01:33:30,554 --> 01:33:32,374
[SPEAKER_04]: You've Street Passed with 25,000 people?

1344
01:33:32,534 --> 01:33:32,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1345
01:33:33,114 --> 01:33:36,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, you're not... Okay, sorry, we're not hearing you for some reason.

1346
01:33:36,395 --> 01:33:37,335
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my fault, I didn't mute you.

1347
01:33:37,355 --> 01:33:37,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Bradley.

1348
01:33:37,815 --> 01:33:40,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so that's not exactly how many I've Street Passed.

1349
01:33:40,356 --> 01:33:40,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually have 1,000...

1350
01:33:52,318 --> 01:33:53,999
[SPEAKER_10]: A little over a thousand street passes.

1351
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:54,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Still, that's a lot.

1352
01:33:55,059 --> 01:34:02,502
[SPEAKER_10]: But the army is 25,000 because as you play the game, you get more people into your army and they'll show you the actual force.

1353
01:34:02,602 --> 01:34:10,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's you come in as a monarch if you've actually been playing the game and then that's when you'll see something more than a few hundred to a thousand.

1354
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:12,846
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why it was 25,000.

1355
01:34:12,926 --> 01:34:14,947
[SPEAKER_10]: It's showing what my actual armory is right now.

1356
01:34:14,987 --> 01:34:18,729
[SPEAKER_04]: But your people weren't like, oh, I'm going to join up.

1357
01:34:19,129 --> 01:34:19,989
[SPEAKER_04]: You tried to attack

1358
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:20,629
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1359
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:45,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy Taxi

1360
01:35:01,107 --> 01:35:01,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Possibly.

1361
01:35:02,268 --> 01:35:07,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Crazy Taxi has come to Android, and yeah, it's out for $5.

1362
01:35:09,153 --> 01:35:11,836
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically like the iOS port.

1363
01:35:11,876 --> 01:35:18,241
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got the two modes, original and arcade, and I think some of the music's back too, so that's good.

1364
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:20,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they don't have Pizza Hut and all that stuff in there, but...

1365
01:35:22,364 --> 01:35:22,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Still fun.

1366
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:25,526
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it does support some controllers.

1367
01:35:25,606 --> 01:35:29,929
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first thing I'm going to do with this game is I'm going to sideload it onto the Ouya to see if it works.

1368
01:35:30,029 --> 01:35:33,071
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's going to be mission number one, I guess.

1369
01:35:34,512 --> 01:35:38,675
[SPEAKER_12]: New Ratchet & Clank game was revealed this week into the Nexus.

1370
01:35:39,436 --> 01:35:48,361
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be coming out at some undetermined point, I guess holiday, for $30 on PlayStation 3.

1371
01:35:49,722 --> 01:35:50,423
[SPEAKER_12]: So look for it then.

1372
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:59,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And last but not least, we have some more details about the PlayStation Plus version of DriveClub.

1373
01:35:59,738 --> 01:36:02,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, it will be missing a few things.

1374
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:12,486
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically the exact same version as the full version, except it's missing a few assets, such as some of the cars or tracks that will be found in the full version.

1375
01:36:12,846 --> 01:36:19,450
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess the PlayStation Plus edition will feature online multiplayer and the single-player campaign.

1376
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:23,853
[SPEAKER_12]: as well as some of the challenges, you will be able to purchase missing content.

1377
01:36:23,953 --> 01:36:27,875
[SPEAKER_04]: But press the R2 button to upgrade to the full version of DriveClub now.

1378
01:36:28,095 --> 01:36:38,221
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's not going to be as expensive as buying the full version of DriveClub, but still, I mean, if you want to check it out, it's kind of a cool thing, and you don't have to buy the full version of it.

1379
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:45,326
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, like, for example, if someone like me just wants to play it on a VOG gaming night or something like that, I don't need to buy the full version.

1380
01:36:45,786 --> 01:36:48,748
[SPEAKER_12]: I can just play it as is, so it'll be cool to check out.

1381
01:36:49,161 --> 01:36:57,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I wasn't expecting... To get a release game on the system's release for free... I mean, usually the PS Plus games aren't new stuff.

1382
01:36:57,706 --> 01:36:58,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually a year old.

1383
01:36:59,227 --> 01:37:02,969
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not totally surprised by this, that it's basically a glorified demo.

1384
01:37:02,989 --> 01:37:05,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But it sounds like it'll at least have some multiplayer.

1385
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:07,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll give you a little something.

1386
01:37:08,092 --> 01:37:10,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is what we get now instead of a pack-in game, right?

1387
01:37:11,994 --> 01:37:13,335
[SPEAKER_04]: A free download coupon.

1388
01:37:13,435 --> 01:37:16,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Technically, you get a pack-in thing, but it's only if you have the camera.

1389
01:37:17,777 --> 01:37:18,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah?

1390
01:37:18,598 --> 01:37:19,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, the camera, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1391
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:22,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the camera, so I guess I'm screwed.

1392
01:37:23,762 --> 01:37:27,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was lucky enough to order a PlayStation 4 early, and I don't plan on changing that.

1393
01:37:28,146 --> 01:37:30,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, moving on to other news.

1394
01:37:30,568 --> 01:37:32,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom had some layoffs this week.

1395
01:37:32,469 --> 01:37:33,670
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always a bit disappointing.

1396
01:37:34,291 --> 01:37:38,995
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the people affected, Christian Svensson, which is the senior VP, excuse me,

1397
01:37:39,355 --> 01:37:40,997
[SPEAKER_04]: of Planning and Business Development.

1398
01:37:41,537 --> 01:37:43,259
[SPEAKER_04]: He apparently is departing the company.

1399
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:51,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom said in a statement, Capcom today laid off several employees from the US office as part of an overall organizational restructure of the company.

1400
01:37:51,848 --> 01:37:58,374
[SPEAKER_04]: The transition to new generation of hardware and changing industry landscape have required us to adapt our business to best meet our new goals.

1401
01:37:58,814 --> 01:38:02,118
[SPEAKER_04]: We sincerely thank each individual for their contributions and wish them well.

1402
01:38:02,578 --> 01:38:04,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is never fun news to report.

1403
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:07,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to kind of figure out the why behind this, though.

1404
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:12,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this because maybe expectations of Lost Planet 3 and so forth are kind of low?

1405
01:38:12,325 --> 01:38:13,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this because there's no more Mega Man?

1406
01:38:14,126 --> 01:38:14,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all Mega Man's fault.

1407
01:38:14,967 --> 01:38:15,487
[SPEAKER_08]: All Mega Man.

1408
01:38:15,507 --> 01:38:16,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all Mega Man's fault.

1409
01:38:16,408 --> 01:38:18,570
[SPEAKER_08]: If you did Mega Man Legends 3, they wouldn't have this problem.

1410
01:38:19,944 --> 01:38:22,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, now, no need to kick them while they're down.

1411
01:38:23,065 --> 01:38:23,345
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1412
01:38:24,406 --> 01:38:32,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Reggie Fils-Aimé in a video on YouTube mentioned that Nintendo fans can pick up Pikmin 3 early at certain video game retailers.

1413
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:40,233
[SPEAKER_04]: July 20th and 21st, you can actually do like a hands-on demo at over 250 GameStop and EB Games locations.

1414
01:38:40,533 --> 01:38:42,974
[SPEAKER_04]: They still have EB Games up and running different places?

1415
01:38:43,454 --> 01:38:44,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Foreign company.

1416
01:38:44,714 --> 01:38:45,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, in Canada.

1417
01:38:45,575 --> 01:38:46,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1418
01:38:46,495 --> 01:38:47,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So the US and Canada will have...

1419
01:38:48,576 --> 01:39:06,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Pikmin 3 experiences or whatever if you pre-order the downloadable version of the game at any GameStop store on either of those two days so you have to go get a download code at GameStop on one of those two days you will be able to get the full game one whole day early on August 3rd

1420
01:39:07,202 --> 01:39:28,147
[SPEAKER_04]: or you can go to Kmart who breaks street dates or Toys R Us or apparently Walmart is the new street date breaker because you know you can get them Twinkies at Walmart yeah it's rogue Twinkies in the Walmart aisles or just wait a day it's Pikmin it's not fucking Grand Theft Auto 5 or something right I mean that's what she got you know that

1421
01:39:29,427 --> 01:39:32,829
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, think of the deal with the devil that you're making here.

1422
01:39:32,849 --> 01:39:40,833
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you're like buying a digital download code at retail to play it one day early.

1423
01:39:40,893 --> 01:39:45,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And they will make you sign a pact at GameStop that you will have to sign with blood.

1424
01:39:45,575 --> 01:39:46,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's give us your email.

1425
01:39:47,256 --> 01:39:52,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, why don't you sign up for the card, you know, so that we can... Hey, you want to get our magazine?

1426
01:39:52,299 --> 01:39:54,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you come... You got Pikmin 2 to trade in?

1427
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:56,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Truth be told, their magazine's actually pretty decent.

1428
01:39:58,152 --> 01:39:59,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing is ever as good as Sonic R.

1429
01:40:21,852 --> 01:40:23,993
[SPEAKER_04]: SuperStreetFighter4, Alina, Poison, Rolento, Hugo

1430
01:40:44,137 --> 01:41:06,310
[SPEAKER_04]: which are all based off of the fact that they were in Street Fighter X Tekken so I'm guessing that they'll be easy enough to bring over so those are the only four confirmed characters at the moment no word about the mystery fifth character although not it doesn't sound like it's Alex I guess there was a rumor going around that it was Alex but it doesn't appear to be Alex so interesting

1431
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:08,690
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this all about here?

1432
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:11,331
[SPEAKER_04]: $15 for the download.

1433
01:41:11,491 --> 01:41:17,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know what the date will be, but there will also be a disc-based version, which I'm assuming is everything, for $40.

1434
01:41:17,774 --> 01:41:19,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Early 2014 is the tentative release.

1435
01:41:19,494 --> 01:41:24,756
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'd like to see some of the EX characters make it into the new Street Fighter 4 stuff.

1436
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool that this game is still going.

1437
01:41:28,058 --> 01:41:30,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, thanks to updates and DLC and all that.

1438
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:31,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You're shaking your head over there.

1439
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,221
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a hater, Loki.

1440
01:41:32,241 --> 01:41:34,262
[SPEAKER_12]: How many times have they re-released this game?

1441
01:41:34,342 --> 01:41:36,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, they've had... How many times have they re-released Street Fighter 2?

1442
01:41:37,504 --> 01:41:46,010
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that, but they had Street Fighter 4, then they had Super Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.

1443
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:48,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking all disc-based releases.

1444
01:41:48,552 --> 01:41:51,554
[SPEAKER_12]: And now they're going to have Hyper Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition?

1445
01:41:51,574 --> 01:41:51,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

1446
01:41:53,328 --> 01:41:54,629
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1447
01:41:54,689 --> 01:41:55,450
[SPEAKER_04]: You draw the lines?

1448
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:58,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop buying that game.

1449
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously.

1450
01:42:00,473 --> 01:42:00,994
[SPEAKER_12]: It's done.

1451
01:42:01,374 --> 01:42:02,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Just make a new Street Fighter game.

1452
01:42:02,875 --> 01:42:04,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Or give me Capcom vs. SNK.

1453
01:42:04,937 --> 01:42:06,558
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Capcom vs. SNK 3.

1454
01:42:07,399 --> 01:42:14,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what evil, satanic packs have to be formed between those companies to get this to happen, but I want that game.

1455
01:42:16,285 --> 01:42:16,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it to me.

1456
01:42:18,787 --> 01:42:20,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1457
01:42:20,068 --> 01:42:21,049
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1458
01:42:23,464 --> 01:42:24,325
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1459
01:42:46,902 --> 01:42:50,285
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just porting the... They're not even porting the game over.

1460
01:42:50,305 --> 01:42:52,868
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it works with controller support already.

1461
01:42:53,068 --> 01:42:54,590
[SPEAKER_12]: You can sideload that thing in there.

1462
01:42:55,651 --> 01:42:56,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I have Sonic CD.

1463
01:42:56,792 --> 01:42:58,253
[SPEAKER_12]: I got it with my MOGA controller.

1464
01:42:59,034 --> 01:43:02,277
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's sideloaded on my Ouya, actually.

1465
01:43:02,558 --> 01:43:04,520
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember if I did that or not.

1466
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:05,681
[SPEAKER_12]: But it works.

1467
01:43:06,335 --> 01:43:09,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Saga of America saying that it's going to be soon.

1468
01:43:10,237 --> 01:43:12,299
[SPEAKER_08]: That same soon that we always refer to.

1469
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:18,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, fans of Skullgirls can be happy that it's coming on PC on August 22nd.

1470
01:43:19,423 --> 01:43:21,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Being put out by Lab Zero Games.

1471
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:23,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know a lot of people are totally into Skullgirls.

1472
01:43:25,046 --> 01:43:34,332
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're also working on five new characters as DLC which is coming directly from their Indiegogo campaign they've actually exceeded their $150,000 goal they've made $828,768 so yay more Skullgirls

1473
01:43:43,328 --> 01:43:46,551
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1474
01:44:02,427 --> 01:44:26,621
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm really looking forward to this there's also a link on here to the documentaries which talks about the game itself and the development so I'm going to go ahead and actually relink this one in the chat room and if any people who are listening to the podcast want to look for it just go to Capcom Unity and look through their blog yeah they're actually going to do a physical retail release with pins in it

1475
01:44:27,681 --> 01:44:28,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1476
01:44:28,843 --> 01:44:30,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I heard about that.

1477
01:44:31,067 --> 01:44:32,749
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a week later, though, which sucks.

1478
01:44:33,891 --> 01:44:35,614
[SPEAKER_04]: But it might still be worth it.

1479
01:44:36,495 --> 01:44:38,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, life is like a hurricane.

1480
01:44:40,922 --> 01:44:41,363
[SPEAKER_04]: It blows?

1481
01:44:41,764 --> 01:44:41,944
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1482
01:44:42,325 --> 01:44:42,525
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1483
01:44:43,936 --> 01:44:44,396
[SPEAKER_08]: The song?

1484
01:44:44,476 --> 01:44:45,577
[SPEAKER_08]: The theme song?

1485
01:44:45,717 --> 01:44:47,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock You Like a Hurricane.

1486
01:44:47,378 --> 01:44:48,738
[SPEAKER_08]: DuckTales Rob theme song.

1487
01:44:48,758 --> 01:44:49,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.

1488
01:44:49,399 --> 01:44:49,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1489
01:44:49,859 --> 01:44:50,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1490
01:44:50,279 --> 01:44:50,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1491
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:50,980
[SPEAKER_04]: God.

1492
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:51,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little slow.

1493
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:52,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez, Rab.

1494
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:57,603
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, though, I listened to the Japanese theme song for DuckTales.

1495
01:44:58,143 --> 01:45:00,024
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of interesting.

1496
01:45:00,404 --> 01:45:01,325
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a song by a lady.

1497
01:45:05,493 --> 01:45:07,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, time for the foogle question of the week, right?

1498
01:45:07,335 --> 01:45:08,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize that was our last story.

1499
01:45:09,258 --> 01:45:11,260
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you got on me for being quiet.

1500
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I was pulling up everything.

1501
01:45:13,002 --> 01:45:14,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're doing it too.

1502
01:45:14,363 --> 01:45:16,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing me plaza games.

1503
01:45:16,145 --> 01:45:16,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Pot kettle.

1504
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:17,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Pot, pot, kettle.

1505
01:45:17,987 --> 01:45:19,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very important.

1506
01:45:19,169 --> 01:45:19,849
[SPEAKER_08]: My butt.

1507
01:45:23,169 --> 01:45:43,552
[SPEAKER_04]: uh let's see uh looking at chat room at live.vognetwork.com apparently BlackWolf made a vine of me playing Pimbot Ness me meaning him while listening to OLR but vine decides not to accept the upload I guess this is why everybody ran away to Instagram sad have you guys played with the Instagram video at all no no

1508
01:45:44,765 --> 01:45:48,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, Instagram is like so three months ago, I swear.

1509
01:45:48,367 --> 01:45:49,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Hipstagram.

1510
01:45:50,108 --> 01:45:51,349
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here, I had to hear this.

1511
01:45:51,409 --> 01:45:56,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to use a top-level digital camera out of irony.

1512
01:46:21,355 --> 01:46:21,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

1513
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:22,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Still catchy.

1514
01:46:24,097 --> 01:46:28,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things transcend language barriers, and a catchy melody is one of those things.

1515
01:46:28,642 --> 01:46:30,443
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1516
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:34,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this little theme song here is a catchy melody for some of you out there.

1517
01:46:41,716 --> 01:46:43,017
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1518
01:47:06,633 --> 01:47:06,974
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1519
01:47:21,973 --> 01:47:27,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment says, There's what I call a classic arcade game that I've played that I'd like to play again, The Act.

1520
01:47:28,578 --> 01:47:35,562
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an extremely rare arcade game that, according to Wikipedia, only one arcade has a working stand-up arcade copy of it.

1521
01:47:35,943 --> 01:47:40,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It just so happens the one arcade with a stand-up copy of The Act is located near me.

1522
01:47:40,746 --> 01:47:42,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like I have something to do on Monday.

1523
01:47:42,907 --> 01:47:43,548
[SPEAKER_04]: What is The Act?

1524
01:47:43,628 --> 01:47:44,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know that one.

1525
01:47:44,929 --> 01:47:46,209
[SPEAKER_12]: The Act is a game.

1526
01:47:46,690 --> 01:47:48,411
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all hand-drawn animation.

1527
01:47:51,993 --> 01:47:52,674
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Loki,

1528
01:48:11,271 --> 01:48:18,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see, Robaba responds on Google Plus and says, I've always wanted to try Hyperball, the ball-bearing gun rapid-fire pinball.

1529
01:48:18,595 --> 01:48:21,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie probably has, and I'm curious as to the general object of that game.

1530
01:48:21,797 --> 01:48:22,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Spell things?

1531
01:48:22,637 --> 01:48:23,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot them faster than they drain?

1532
01:48:24,418 --> 01:48:25,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked about it earlier.

1533
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:25,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

1534
01:48:26,259 --> 01:48:29,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like shooting them really fast, and just because it's fun.

1535
01:48:30,362 --> 01:48:33,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's so many, it's like you can play with so many balls.

1536
01:48:34,264 --> 01:48:34,644
Ha ha ha!

1537
01:48:35,024 --> 01:48:36,886
[SPEAKER_08]: You can paddle balls all day.

1538
01:48:36,946 --> 01:48:39,528
[SPEAKER_04]: You just took all those balls all at once, didn't you, DarkSakura?

1539
01:48:39,568 --> 01:48:40,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And I beat them.

1540
01:48:40,969 --> 01:48:43,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I beat those balls with flippers.

1541
01:48:45,133 --> 01:48:45,893
[SPEAKER_04]: With your flipper?

1542
01:48:46,314 --> 01:48:46,834
[SPEAKER_08]: My flippers.

1543
01:48:51,131 --> 01:48:52,551
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is fucking loud, by the way.

1544
01:48:52,731 --> 01:48:54,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to Facebook.

1545
01:48:55,032 --> 01:49:03,614
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I just want to point out over on Facebook right now, we have 572 people that like us on Facebook, which is a nice admirable number, but we're 572.

1546
01:49:04,794 --> 01:49:08,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We need one more like, and then there'll be a huge Bomani in joke there.

1547
01:49:08,655 --> 01:49:09,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, people.

1548
01:49:09,895 --> 01:49:11,876
[SPEAKER_04]: One more like on Facebook.

1549
01:49:12,736 --> 01:49:13,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody give it to us.

1550
01:49:13,316 --> 01:49:13,496
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1551
01:49:13,836 --> 01:49:16,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Kurti K replied and said, Simpsons pinball.

1552
01:49:17,617 --> 01:49:19,299
[SPEAKER_04]: There were actually two Simpsons pinball machines.

1553
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:21,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it Simpsons Pinball Party, are you thinking?

1554
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:22,742
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an old one and a newer one, isn't there?

1555
01:49:22,902 --> 01:49:24,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Simpsons Pinball Party we used to have at my house.

1556
01:49:24,743 --> 01:49:24,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1557
01:49:25,424 --> 01:49:26,205
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a pretty fun table.

1558
01:49:26,954 --> 01:49:40,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy R said, I was a bit young during the arcade boom, so I don't remember, but if I can expand to non-classic arcade games, I really want to play Jubit or Reflect Beat in an arcade.

1559
01:49:41,383 --> 01:49:46,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I love rhythm games like Technica, and I feel these games would be a lot more fun in the arcade than their iPad equivalents.

1560
01:49:47,266 --> 01:49:47,807
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be right.

1561
01:49:48,487 --> 01:49:52,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, I no longer live near Round 1 or Sunnyvale Golf Land, so I guess I'll have to settle for the iPad.

1562
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:54,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that reminds me of something, Rob.

1563
01:49:55,011 --> 01:49:57,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what game they also have there speaking of side-scrolling?

1564
01:49:57,432 --> 01:49:57,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Willow.

1565
01:50:12,938 --> 01:50:13,859
[SPEAKER_04]: and Willow Arcade.

1566
01:50:13,919 --> 01:50:14,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

1567
01:50:14,879 --> 01:50:16,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for the Facebook noises.

1568
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:20,681
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not disabled on this computer and freaking people are setting it off on purpose.

1569
01:50:21,322 --> 01:50:22,002
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1570
01:50:22,182 --> 01:50:26,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Thomas B replies and says, have you ever heard of the pinball machine Hercules?

1571
01:50:26,504 --> 01:50:26,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1572
01:50:26,624 --> 01:50:28,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe they used four inch balls.

1573
01:50:29,205 --> 01:50:30,605
[SPEAKER_04]: The machine was very large.

1574
01:50:30,705 --> 01:50:33,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I only played it a few times, but it was always fun to play.

1575
01:50:33,066 --> 01:50:34,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like big balls, DarkSakura?

1576
01:50:34,367 --> 01:50:34,987
[SPEAKER_08]: And I cannot lie.

1577
01:50:35,587 --> 01:50:36,407
[SPEAKER_08]: It used a cue ball.

1578
01:50:37,248 --> 01:50:37,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like in pool?

1579
01:50:38,345 --> 01:50:43,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and they had one at the last Classic Gaming Expo I went to.

1580
01:50:43,507 --> 01:50:46,808
[SPEAKER_08]: It was at California Extreme two years ago.

1581
01:50:46,848 --> 01:50:49,309
[SPEAKER_08]: They also had that dressed-up Captain Fantastic, too.

1582
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:54,231
[SPEAKER_08]: The big Elton John platform boots from Tommy.

1583
01:50:55,332 --> 01:50:57,893
[SPEAKER_08]: But Hercules is actually... I'm short.

1584
01:50:57,953 --> 01:51:00,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a hard time playing that game because I can't really...

1585
01:51:01,554 --> 01:51:02,776
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't reach the balls?

1586
01:51:02,856 --> 01:51:06,542
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I have to... It's like as wide out as my arms go.

1587
01:51:07,343 --> 01:51:08,424
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like my wingspan.

1588
01:51:08,925 --> 01:51:10,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And hitting the flippers is difficult.

1589
01:51:11,128 --> 01:51:12,010
[SPEAKER_08]: And it moves slowly.

1590
01:51:13,138 --> 01:51:18,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya says, there was one I played years ago in Santa Cruz that I'd love to chance to play again, Namco's Galaxian 3.

1591
01:51:19,141 --> 01:51:26,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine a gigantic booth with six seats, two 50-inch monitors with a separate laser displayer for each one, and six Star Wars-style flight controllers.

1592
01:51:27,225 --> 01:51:33,388
[SPEAKER_04]: You fly along in your gunship, shooting at aliens as they fly in formation, while occasionally dealing with a gigantic alien boss.

1593
01:51:33,428 --> 01:51:37,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's up to you and your teammates to take them down before they deplete your ship's life meter to zero.

1594
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:39,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Suffice to say, it's pretty epic.

1595
01:51:39,551 --> 01:51:40,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to know something depressing?

1596
01:51:41,732 --> 01:51:52,717
[SPEAKER_08]: At our Roseville Dave & Busters, right by the Redemption area, there is this booth that, for a different game, but that booth was once a Galaxian 3 booth.

1597
01:51:54,158 --> 01:51:57,099
[SPEAKER_08]: It even has some of the decorating elements on it.

1598
01:51:57,579 --> 01:51:59,260
[SPEAKER_08]: That used to be a Galaxian 3 booth.

1599
01:52:00,627 --> 01:52:15,594
[SPEAKER_04]: uh let's see um Will M replied and said an arcade game I've never played and would love to difficult to answer as I've played a massive amount due to traveling around but I can name one I'd love to play again the Ninja Warriors that widescreen was oh so damn awesome

1600
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:19,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Chiggers says, I remember playing the kiss table when I was a kid.

1601
01:52:19,839 --> 01:52:20,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.

1602
01:52:21,121 --> 01:52:25,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator said, I never had the opportunity to play the arcade version of Killer Instinct, which I regret.

1603
01:52:26,108 --> 01:52:30,755
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of stuff I want to play again, it's Samurai Shodown 4, Amakusa's Revenge.

1604
01:52:31,676 --> 01:52:32,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitstun says,

1605
01:53:01,301 --> 01:53:02,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds a lot like Proteus.

1606
01:53:02,322 --> 01:53:05,764
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's only console release is a Japanese PlayStation 2 exclusive.

1607
01:53:06,084 --> 01:53:08,145
[SPEAKER_04]: He could have made that up and I'd never know the difference.

1608
01:53:09,326 --> 01:53:15,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Codeman replied and said, I know this sounds like a generic answer, but I've always wanted to play the Tron arcade game.

1609
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:16,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?

1610
01:53:16,831 --> 01:53:17,071
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1611
01:53:17,111 --> 01:53:18,432
[SPEAKER_04]: There was Tron and Discs of Tron.

1612
01:53:18,712 --> 01:53:21,314
[SPEAKER_08]: They had actually Tron and Discs of Tron next to each other.

1613
01:53:22,454 --> 01:53:24,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Codeman, more reason for you to go to Disneyland.

1614
01:53:24,616 --> 01:53:25,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1615
01:53:25,868 --> 01:53:29,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you have a little girl who soon will be old enough to appreciate Disneyland.

1616
01:53:29,912 --> 01:53:30,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1617
01:53:30,492 --> 01:53:33,095
[SPEAKER_08]: If you take a child to Disneyland before they're five years old, they get in free.

1618
01:53:33,795 --> 01:53:34,917
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1619
01:53:35,097 --> 01:53:36,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And a game called Time Pilot.

1620
01:53:37,039 --> 01:53:37,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Time Pilot's fun.

1621
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:40,942
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, for what it's worth, that's on Xbox Live Arcade.

1622
01:53:41,222 --> 01:53:43,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And it plays pretty decently with a 360 analog stick.

1623
01:53:44,105 --> 01:53:44,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for what it's worth.

1624
01:53:45,787 --> 01:53:46,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was in Game Room.

1625
01:53:47,597 --> 01:53:55,121
[SPEAKER_04]: and lastly Kane I Am says not that I ever played it but I really want the Elvira Mistress of the Darkness table for my house because boobies.

1626
01:53:55,761 --> 01:53:56,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent answer.

1627
01:53:56,562 --> 01:53:57,982
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a great table too.

1628
01:53:58,042 --> 01:53:58,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1629
01:53:59,123 --> 01:53:59,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Which one?

1630
01:53:59,423 --> 01:54:01,124
[SPEAKER_08]: The Elvira Mistress or the Scared Steff?

1631
01:54:01,984 --> 01:54:03,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Elvira Mistress of the Dark.

1632
01:54:03,527 --> 01:54:04,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Scaredstiff, I think, is a better table.

1633
01:54:04,927 --> 01:54:16,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I know you saw this, DarkSakura, because Alan and I went out to a bar in San Francisco after the Frank Music concert on the 4th of July, or the night before the 4th of July.

1634
01:54:16,451 --> 01:54:17,672
[SPEAKER_04]: We went out in San Francisco.

1635
01:54:17,712 --> 01:54:21,853
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to this bar in the Castro called Moby Dick, and they have pinball machines there.

1636
01:54:22,513 --> 01:54:30,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, literally, it was like DarkSakura and Alan Alchemy pinball paradise because they had a World Cup Sakura 94.

1637
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:30,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1638
01:54:31,756 --> 01:54:49,251
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had Elvira Scared Stiff Okay, I need to go there Yeah First of all And gays and booze and a pool table Like five of my favorite things together That actually is like college for me Well, keep in mind, I worked in a pool hall Uh-huh

1639
01:54:50,601 --> 01:54:56,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very certain that my boss, even though he was a major dick, he did set off the gator a bit.

1640
01:54:57,902 --> 01:55:01,343
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, there were also the three other guys that I used to hang out with.

1641
01:55:01,363 --> 01:55:04,263
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, I've been a hag all my life, Rob.

1642
01:55:04,283 --> 01:55:04,963
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?

1643
01:55:05,143 --> 01:55:05,864
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

1644
01:55:06,424 --> 01:55:08,024
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had the World Cup soccer there.

1645
01:55:08,644 --> 01:55:13,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Across the street at Solomon's, they had the Mistress of the Dark.

1646
01:55:14,145 --> 01:55:18,166
[SPEAKER_04]: But did your pool hall let people play free if they weren't wearing pants?

1647
01:55:18,586 --> 01:55:19,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this place did.

1648
01:55:20,499 --> 01:55:23,300
[SPEAKER_08]: No, usually if they weren't wearing pants.

1649
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:24,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

1650
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,241
[SPEAKER_08]: I could wear a skirt, then I wouldn't be wearing pants.

1651
01:55:27,642 --> 01:55:29,602
[SPEAKER_08]: What if a guy comes in in a Utila kilt?

1652
01:55:29,783 --> 01:55:30,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that count?

1653
01:55:31,303 --> 01:55:35,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't question the system because nobody wants to see me up there playing it.

1654
01:55:35,465 --> 01:55:35,865
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1655
01:55:35,905 --> 01:55:37,966
[SPEAKER_08]: You should just have sequined boxers.

1656
01:55:38,726 --> 01:55:41,507
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you know I don't?

1657
01:55:43,984 --> 01:55:45,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, does Rob have sequin boxers?

1658
01:55:46,045 --> 01:55:48,766
[SPEAKER_12]: The 1970s basketball shorts.

1659
01:55:50,827 --> 01:55:52,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the ones that are up to here.

1660
01:55:52,467 --> 01:55:53,647
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the teeny slit.

1661
01:55:54,328 --> 01:55:56,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Like your ass literally hangs out of them.

1662
01:55:56,568 --> 01:55:57,709
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to go in Columbia shorts.

1663
01:55:57,749 --> 01:55:58,549
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not sexy at all.

1664
01:55:58,689 --> 01:55:59,550
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this is sexy.

1665
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:01,310
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this is sexy.

1666
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:02,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Columbia shorts.

1667
01:56:02,891 --> 01:56:03,191
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1668
01:56:04,331 --> 01:56:05,592
[SPEAKER_04]: That was all our answers.

1669
01:56:05,992 --> 01:56:09,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys at Facebook and Google Plus for answering the question.

1670
01:56:09,053 --> 01:56:09,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate it.

1671
01:56:10,254 --> 01:56:14,696
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't get your question or your answer read this week, sorry, but try sending an email.

1672
01:56:15,176 --> 01:56:18,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Let me quickly open that up to folks here in studio.

1673
01:56:18,977 --> 01:56:24,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there an elusive game you haven't been able to play or maybe something you played once long ago you're dying to play again?

1674
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:24,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley?

1675
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:41,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking of when I played it a long time ago, Galaxy Force 2, the actual arcade game that actually had a full rotating seat or sit down cabinet where you basically Sumo Yeah, but full rotating.

1676
01:56:42,121 --> 01:56:43,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you actually go upside down and stuff?

1677
01:56:43,763 --> 01:56:44,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

1678
01:57:01,468 --> 01:57:04,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I would have said the Galaxian 3, but someone already said that.

1679
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:12,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I would be willing to try the Silent Hill arcade game, because I still haven't played that, and I know that was something that they made a while ago.

1680
01:57:13,075 --> 01:57:14,816
[SPEAKER_12]: So the Silent Hill arcade game would be fun.

1681
01:57:15,336 --> 01:57:21,200
[SPEAKER_12]: And although it's not really an arcade game, I'd love to go back and play Battletech again as part of Virtual World.

1682
01:57:22,781 --> 01:57:23,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Alan just text you?

1683
01:57:24,041 --> 01:57:25,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he did, and he said no.

1684
01:57:26,663 --> 01:57:26,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan!

1685
01:57:28,564 --> 01:57:29,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, is there something that's been eluding you?

1686
01:57:31,423 --> 01:57:38,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to play Radiant Silvergun again because I've played an arcade version of that and I loved Gun Survivor 2, Byhazard Gun Survivor 2.

1687
01:57:40,427 --> 01:57:46,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what I would actually like to play again as far as tables that I haven't seen in a little while is a Black Rose.

1688
01:57:47,590 --> 01:57:48,971
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been trying to get Dan to get us one.

1689
01:57:49,351 --> 01:57:50,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to have a Black Rose.

1690
01:57:51,092 --> 01:57:51,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1691
01:58:09,006 --> 01:58:14,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my answer would be I would really like to play F-Zero AX again in one of the sit-down cabinets.

1692
01:58:15,129 --> 01:58:17,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit was pretty amazing and I missed that an awful lot.

1693
01:58:18,290 --> 01:58:19,291
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to be able to play that again.

1694
01:58:19,311 --> 01:58:21,032
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're not talking just the regular sit-down cabinets.

1695
01:58:21,052 --> 01:58:22,572
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're talking the ones that rotate.

1696
01:58:22,592 --> 01:58:25,534
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones that will almost flip you upside down, like just shy of that.

1697
01:58:25,934 --> 01:58:26,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed that.

1698
01:58:26,674 --> 01:58:27,594
[SPEAKER_04]: That was epic.

1699
01:58:28,375 --> 01:58:29,935
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say maybe, yeah, I guess that's my answer.

1700
01:58:30,035 --> 01:58:30,696
[SPEAKER_04]: F-Zero AX.

1701
01:58:30,936 --> 01:58:31,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to play that again.

1702
01:58:31,656 --> 01:58:35,698
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was like a table, a pinball table that I hadn't played in a long time that I actually got to see it

1703
01:58:36,258 --> 01:58:37,159
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1704
01:59:00,736 --> 01:59:01,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Coupa Kid Jeremy Coupa Kid Jeremy

1705
01:59:20,976 --> 01:59:46,609
[SPEAKER_04]: like that's what old arcades smelled like and Chuck E. Cheese well Chuck E. Cheese didn't smell like cigarettes like they did ban smoking in there I think because you know kids but cheap pizza for sure at Chuck E. Cheese anyhow uh let's see Codeman says tell me about it I don't even want to know what an arcade is anymore well god I think there's somebody legit said in their answer you know I think I was kind of born after arcades were really a thing and that just made me like

1706
01:59:47,129 --> 01:59:48,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a sad for a minute.

1707
01:59:48,911 --> 01:59:49,411
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1708
01:59:49,711 --> 01:59:51,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to offer up a description.

1709
01:59:51,813 --> 01:59:54,835
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the Aladdin's Castle in Mobile, Alabama.

1710
01:59:55,495 --> 01:59:58,778
[SPEAKER_08]: The day I went after my little brother had gotten hit by a car.

1711
01:59:59,378 --> 01:59:59,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my.

1712
01:59:59,899 --> 02:00:00,459
[SPEAKER_08]: He was six.

1713
02:00:00,659 --> 02:00:01,340
[SPEAKER_08]: He's 30 now.

1714
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,622
[SPEAKER_08]: No, 27 right now.

1715
02:00:04,782 --> 02:00:06,584
[SPEAKER_08]: So that, you know, dates it.

1716
02:00:07,484 --> 02:00:11,227
[SPEAKER_08]: The walls were half-carpeted, the same way they had been since the 70s.

1717
02:00:11,468 --> 02:00:16,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this has to be like 1992, something like that.

1718
02:00:16,292 --> 02:00:16,272
91.

1719
02:00:18,133 --> 02:00:21,176
[SPEAKER_08]: The walls had brown carpet up to the side, like a roller rink does.

1720
02:00:22,257 --> 02:00:22,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Old wallpaper.

1721
02:00:24,138 --> 02:00:26,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Posters of games from the 80s.

1722
02:00:28,222 --> 02:00:32,446
[SPEAKER_08]: The first thing that you saw when you walked in was a Samurai Shodown 2 on the 44-inch screen.

1723
02:00:33,086 --> 02:00:33,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Big-ass thing.

1724
02:00:34,207 --> 02:00:35,708
[SPEAKER_08]: To the left would have been a hockey table.

1725
02:00:35,748 --> 02:00:36,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember it perfectly.

1726
02:00:36,609 --> 02:00:38,250
[SPEAKER_08]: To the left would have been an air hockey table.

1727
02:00:39,051 --> 02:00:41,112
[SPEAKER_08]: As you go back, you see Nark.

1728
02:00:41,973 --> 02:00:44,254
[SPEAKER_08]: You see a four-player Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1729
02:00:44,755 --> 02:00:48,377
[SPEAKER_08]: You see a Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting Edition.

1730
02:00:49,038 --> 02:00:49,598
[SPEAKER_08]: You see...

1731
02:00:51,039 --> 02:00:52,441
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1732
02:01:08,638 --> 02:01:09,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Chuck E. Cheese smells like pee

1733
02:01:29,392 --> 02:01:52,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember they do now that's for sure I don't remember from when I was a kid but maybe you know everything I remember I have this really early memory you know I don't remember a lot from when I was like before like you know you don't remember a lot from before you're like five years old I don't know about you guys but one thing I do remember is being I think I was three years old at my sister's wedding because my sister would have been 19 or 20 at the time because there's a big age difference between us

1734
02:01:52,844 --> 02:01:53,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1735
02:02:17,982 --> 02:02:30,684
[SPEAKER_04]: and I remember a room at Chuck E. Cheese that was nothing but a strobe light and you would dance in front of the strobe light or whatever and like it's like 80s technology like strobe lights or like this new technology.

1736
02:02:30,724 --> 02:02:32,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can have a strobe light on your fucking phone.

1737
02:02:32,545 --> 02:02:34,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Did yours have the day glow room?

1738
02:02:35,045 --> 02:02:35,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

1739
02:02:35,505 --> 02:02:46,007
[SPEAKER_08]: It was black lights with drawings on the wall that would glow under the black light and at my Chuck E. Cheese and this is like the old old ass one that like I think burned down.

1740
02:02:47,427 --> 02:02:56,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but there were the hands and feet on the wall right above the door and you go through the door and you're in this little room that's day glow and then on the other side is the bathroom.

1741
02:02:56,591 --> 02:02:56,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1742
02:02:57,572 --> 02:02:58,512
[SPEAKER_08]: But we had that too.

1743
02:02:58,552 --> 02:03:00,953
[SPEAKER_08]: We had the strobe room too and then we had the room with the hippo lady.

1744
02:03:01,713 --> 02:03:02,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I remember the hippo lady.

1745
02:03:03,014 --> 02:03:04,374
[SPEAKER_08]: The party room with hippo lady.

1746
02:03:04,474 --> 02:03:05,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Henrietta Hippo.

1747
02:03:05,355 --> 02:03:06,996
[SPEAKER_04]: They still have all the animatronics.

1748
02:03:07,036 --> 02:03:08,816
[SPEAKER_04]: They get scarier as you get older.

1749
02:03:09,437 --> 02:03:09,837
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.

1750
02:03:10,237 --> 02:03:12,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we had the showbiz pizza at my place.

1751
02:03:14,064 --> 02:03:14,824
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them bought the other.

1752
02:03:14,864 --> 02:03:16,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuck E. Cheese bought Showbiz at one point.

1753
02:03:17,505 --> 02:03:18,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Pizza Time Theater.

1754
02:03:18,666 --> 02:03:20,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you from this area?

1755
02:03:20,827 --> 02:03:22,388
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm from South Carolina.

1756
02:03:22,908 --> 02:03:24,369
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who owned Pizza Time Theater, right?

1757
02:03:24,509 --> 02:03:26,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Nolan Bushnell.

1758
02:03:27,290 --> 02:03:29,411
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there was Bullwinkles that had the water show.

1759
02:03:30,712 --> 02:03:31,413
[SPEAKER_12]: Water Sports.

1760
02:03:31,613 --> 02:03:32,473
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a water show.

1761
02:03:32,513 --> 02:03:34,074
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a fountain.

1762
02:03:34,214 --> 02:03:36,795
[SPEAKER_12]: It would just do this fountain show thing.

1763
02:03:36,875 --> 02:03:39,437
[SPEAKER_12]: A miniature version of what you would see at the Bellagio.

1764
02:03:39,497 --> 02:03:41,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like the climax of The Great Muppet Caper?

1765
02:03:41,658 --> 02:03:43,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Miss Piggy come out on the fountain?

1766
02:03:43,159 --> 02:03:43,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of, I guess.

1767
02:03:44,019 --> 02:03:45,280
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Bullwinkles.

1768
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,281
[SPEAKER_12]: All the Bullwinkles characters.

1769
02:03:47,609 --> 02:03:49,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go to an arcade, arcade, arcade

1770
02:04:13,513 --> 02:04:20,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went to some mall and, you know, because my mom liked to shop anyway, so we went to the mall and they had an arcade and I got my way.

1771
02:04:21,036 --> 02:04:23,637
[SPEAKER_12]: I fucking miss malls having arcades.

1772
02:04:23,857 --> 02:04:24,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1773
02:04:24,657 --> 02:04:25,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1774
02:04:26,438 --> 02:04:35,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss, and actually I'd have to say that even though I hated doing parties and stuff, that was probably the most fun job I've had was working at the arcade.

1775
02:04:35,521 --> 02:04:36,502
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1776
02:04:56,978 --> 02:05:02,664
[SPEAKER_08]: When Tekken 3 just came out, and we had just been purchased by Namco as well, so we had shirts with Pac-Man on it, it was really cool.

1777
02:05:03,044 --> 02:05:07,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And went over to the cyber station that was all Pac-Man branded themed and everything, and that was really cool.

1778
02:05:07,929 --> 02:05:13,194
[SPEAKER_08]: But working at the Aladdin's Castle was just a touch like working in an old 80s style arcade.

1779
02:05:13,674 --> 02:05:15,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had a good time there.

1780
02:05:15,536 --> 02:05:19,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would come home with a migraine every night, but other than that, I had a great time working there.

1781
02:05:24,635 --> 02:05:26,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good memories about arcades.

1782
02:05:26,617 --> 02:05:27,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1783
02:05:28,759 --> 02:05:33,343
[SPEAKER_08]: And also that was figuring out the right place to knee the Street Fighter Alpha 2 where I could play for free.

1784
02:05:34,364 --> 02:05:37,386
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, was that like your first minimum wage job type of thing?

1785
02:05:38,307 --> 02:05:38,447
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1786
02:05:38,908 --> 02:05:44,893
[SPEAKER_08]: My first minimum wage job was working for a grocery store, which I probably quit a week later because they scheduled me during my classes.

1787
02:05:45,333 --> 02:05:46,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Dope.

1788
02:05:46,434 --> 02:05:49,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't actually count that as a for reals job because it was hell.

1789
02:05:49,377 --> 02:05:50,838
[SPEAKER_04]: My first minimum wage job was not that bad.

1790
02:05:51,966 --> 02:06:01,681
[SPEAKER_08]: My second one was working in the game room at school and then after that it was working at a cookie store where I lived on cookies for a year and then it was the arcade.

1791
02:06:02,925 --> 02:06:04,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked at a place called... They don't exist anymore.

1792
02:06:04,887 --> 02:06:08,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Placer TV Video, which was a video rental store they used to rent.

1793
02:06:08,349 --> 02:06:08,830
[SPEAKER_12]: I know of them.

1794
02:06:09,010 --> 02:06:13,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, they were still around in the mid-90s when everything was starting to shift to DVD.

1795
02:06:13,934 --> 02:06:21,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that time, they were still renting NES games and videotapes, but they didn't really get on the DVD bandwagon fast enough, and that's kind of what killed them.

1796
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:22,981
[SPEAKER_04]: But we rented porn.

1797
02:06:23,962 --> 02:06:24,162
Like...

1798
02:06:24,562 --> 02:06:25,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have the red door?

1799
02:06:41,139 --> 02:06:42,340
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was just on the top shelf.

1800
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:43,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1801
02:06:43,820 --> 02:06:45,661
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no laws prohibiting that stuff.

1802
02:06:45,922 --> 02:06:53,105
[SPEAKER_04]: People weren't so freaking... I remember... Like, trying to be politically correct and protect everybody back then.

1803
02:06:53,125 --> 02:06:54,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember... Kids can't reach that high.

1804
02:06:55,026 --> 02:06:58,708
[SPEAKER_08]: My granny taking me to rent videos when I was in Dothan for a summer.

1805
02:06:59,228 --> 02:07:01,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, the arcade we had in Dothan was Tilt.

1806
02:07:01,449 --> 02:07:02,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember Tilt.

1807
02:07:03,290 --> 02:07:03,491
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1808
02:07:04,691 --> 02:07:07,432
[SPEAKER_08]: She just said, okay, pick whatever movie, make sure it's a good movie.

1809
02:07:08,172 --> 02:07:12,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rent Star Wars like 57,000 times and just actually return to the Jedi because that was my favorite movie.

1810
02:07:13,053 --> 02:07:20,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I once rented this movie that I think the name was in another language, but it was pretty much Tiger Shark.

1811
02:07:20,755 --> 02:07:23,515
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was one of those Jaws-like movies except with naked people.

1812
02:07:24,156 --> 02:07:25,016
[SPEAKER_08]: And I watched it.

1813
02:07:25,136 --> 02:07:27,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched the whole movie.

1814
02:07:28,057 --> 02:07:32,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, my sister's with me and she's like, this movie's dirty.

1815
02:07:32,958 --> 02:07:33,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like...

1816
02:07:34,448 --> 02:07:35,649
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much blood.

1817
02:07:37,289 --> 02:07:38,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Blood RG, yeah.

1818
02:07:38,610 --> 02:07:43,012
[SPEAKER_08]: But I loved being taken to go rent movies with people who wouldn't read labels.

1819
02:07:43,272 --> 02:07:43,672
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1820
02:07:43,772 --> 02:07:47,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Memory lane, memory lane, and we're not even back into gaming news.

1821
02:07:47,614 --> 02:07:48,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1822
02:07:48,874 --> 02:07:50,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back into some gaming news, Loki.

1823
02:07:51,195 --> 02:07:57,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so there was a little bit of a controversy with the new DSX game, The Fall, that came out on iOS platforms.

1824
02:07:57,857 --> 02:08:02,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, the game had a lockout for jailbroken devices.

1825
02:08:03,059 --> 02:08:08,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I guess the general thought is, well, your device is jailbroken, you're probably stealing the game.

1826
02:08:09,421 --> 02:08:10,282
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not always true.

1827
02:08:10,362 --> 02:08:16,146
[SPEAKER_12]: People jailbreak devices to put their phone on a different carrier or something like that.

1828
02:08:16,546 --> 02:08:17,206
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's that.

1829
02:08:17,286 --> 02:08:24,952
[SPEAKER_12]: So people that were legitimately buying the game, allegedly, were unable to fire the gun in the game.

1830
02:08:25,492 --> 02:08:26,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Couldn't fire it.

1831
02:08:26,713 --> 02:08:26,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing.

1832
02:08:27,697 --> 02:08:38,426
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of a... I mean, it's like one of the... You hear about the clever anti-piracy things like, you know, in what, Batman Arkham Asylum, like you couldn't jump far enough to get past certain parts of the game.

1833
02:08:38,806 --> 02:08:44,611
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I can applaud for a clever anti-piracy thing, but jailbreaking your device isn't piracy.

1834
02:08:44,631 --> 02:08:45,572
[SPEAKER_04]: It's legal, actually.

1835
02:08:46,352 --> 02:08:48,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought didn't they come down and say that was illegal?

1836
02:08:48,793 --> 02:08:50,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's gone back and forth a few times.

1837
02:08:50,954 --> 02:08:51,435
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mess.

1838
02:08:51,675 --> 02:08:56,317
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I mean, people, exactly like you said, just because you jailbreak your device doesn't make you a pirate.

1839
02:08:56,677 --> 02:08:56,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1840
02:08:57,498 --> 02:09:11,665
[SPEAKER_12]: And on top of that, though, there is an app that you can get from the homebrew store or whatever that basically you can patch it so that you can play the game.

1841
02:09:11,825 --> 02:09:15,207
[SPEAKER_12]: It basically makes your device look like it's not jailbroken, even though it is.

1842
02:09:15,498 --> 02:09:22,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what they should have done is they should have put this out there on the piracy sites like the hours before they put it out on the official app store.

1843
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:31,382
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you get the pirates is you got to put like the version of the game up on the piracy sites and then kind of like flood the market, so to speak.

1844
02:09:32,002 --> 02:09:34,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it'll get ratted out as a fake soon enough.

1845
02:09:34,283 --> 02:09:36,603
[SPEAKER_04]: But by that point, it's already kind of saturated.

1846
02:09:36,703 --> 02:09:40,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if you know, apparently, you know, people didn't like that.

1847
02:09:40,364 --> 02:09:41,565
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the case.

1848
02:09:41,645 --> 02:09:43,085
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're going to patch it out later on.

1849
02:09:43,345 --> 02:09:44,446
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1850
02:10:02,896 --> 02:10:14,569
[SPEAKER_12]: We did not clearly state that the game would not support jailbroken devices, and we'll be switching this off via an update so that all support iOS devices will be able to play the game in the near future.

1851
02:10:15,441 --> 02:10:15,721
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1852
02:10:34,282 --> 02:10:36,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some people are watching it while they're listening to the show.

1853
02:10:36,644 --> 02:10:38,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It's finishing up right now, I believe.

1854
02:10:39,065 --> 02:10:40,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, big controversy this week.

1855
02:10:40,987 --> 02:10:41,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

1856
02:10:42,047 --> 02:10:46,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Melee was pulled from the live streaming schedule at one point.

1857
02:10:47,151 --> 02:10:47,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

1858
02:10:47,911 --> 02:10:49,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Melee was pulled from the weekend event.

1859
02:10:50,013 --> 02:10:51,574
[SPEAKER_04]: In an update on Shoryuken.com...

1860
02:10:52,754 --> 02:11:19,399
[SPEAKER_04]: EVO co-founder Inkblot said regrettably we've just been informed by Nintendo of America that we do not have permission to broadcast Super Smash Brothers Melee for EVO 2013 well now this whole thing was a bit of a mess because in order to get the game featured in EVO in the first place they had to do a charity fundraiser to raise the money not for the tournament but I think to get like like the whole thing was like which fan communities can raise the most money for a good cause will feature those games in EVO that's the sense I get from this whole thing

1861
02:11:19,919 --> 02:11:44,424
[SPEAKER_04]: and sure enough the fans of Smash Brothers Melee raised $90,000 well in comes Big Bad Nintendo to pull the plug on this you know to not have this happen but thanks to the immense vocalness of the internet and trending topics on Twitter, Reddit certainly a bit of a PR nightmare and within hours Melee returned to be broadcast over the EVO 2013 tournament

1862
02:11:48,085 --> 02:11:51,146
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting, though, is that it did came out after that.

1863
02:11:51,546 --> 02:11:52,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So it got reinstated.

1864
02:11:52,546 --> 02:11:52,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pulled.

1865
02:11:52,986 --> 02:11:53,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It was reinstated.

1866
02:11:53,686 --> 02:12:04,549
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it came out after that, that co-founder Joey Quellar, I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong, said about the he's a co-founder of the EVO thing and an organizer.

1867
02:12:04,609 --> 02:12:10,090
[SPEAKER_04]: He said they were not only trying to shut down the stream, they were trying to shut down the event, the smash portion of the event.

1868
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:11,370
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their IP.

1869
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:12,310
[SPEAKER_04]: They can do what they want.

1870
02:12:12,330 --> 02:12:14,711
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't present us with any options to keep it open.

1871
02:12:15,651 --> 02:12:18,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but of course that obviously didn't happen.

1872
02:12:18,213 --> 02:12:19,414
[SPEAKER_04]: They ended up streaming it after all.

1873
02:12:19,454 --> 02:12:28,699
[SPEAKER_04]: This does seem like a real bad case of communication and kind of the PR department saying one thing and the legal department coming through and saying another.

1874
02:12:29,139 --> 02:12:32,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is incredibly protective of their IPs and so forth.

1875
02:12:32,982 --> 02:12:36,444
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like it wasn't really understood what was going on.

1876
02:12:36,924 --> 02:12:37,325
[SPEAKER_04]: EVO Evolution

1877
02:12:55,501 --> 02:12:57,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, I thought I said, sorry, yeah, Evo.

1878
02:12:58,644 --> 02:13:00,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, anyway, I thought of this.

1879
02:13:00,786 --> 02:13:03,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I was reminded of a couple years ago.

1880
02:13:03,087 --> 02:13:09,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember when Weird Al did that parody of Lady Gaga's Born This Way that was performed this way?

1881
02:13:10,053 --> 02:13:13,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said that he couldn't put it out.

1882
02:13:13,957 --> 02:13:15,998
[SPEAKER_04]: He was going to do it as like a single or whatever.

1883
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:18,861
[SPEAKER_04]: He couldn't put it out because Lady Gaga said no.

1884
02:13:19,261 --> 02:13:45,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Lady Gaga he always gets permission from the artist or at least always tries you know but if the artist says no he won't put it out and Lady Gaga said no and all these people started tweeting Lady Gaga like you know bitch it's weird out let him do the song well turns out Lady Gaga comes out and says I never heard the song one of my people to or like you know one of her legal people said no to it even though that legal person in the response said Lady Gaga said no but she had never heard it

1885
02:13:46,621 --> 02:13:48,342
[SPEAKER_04]: and it wasn't until the whole thing blew up on the internet.

1886
02:13:48,722 --> 02:13:54,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't help but be reminded of that because unfortunately, yes, I'm comparing Nintendo to Lady Gaga.

1887
02:13:54,465 --> 02:13:55,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Hear me out here.

1888
02:13:56,106 --> 02:14:04,670
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's this whole big mess of he said, she said, right hand isn't talking to left hand and this is the stuff that happens and it did make Nintendo look stupid.

1889
02:14:05,231 --> 02:14:11,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, this is all for... Well, it was done by charity for a good cause to bring...

1890
02:14:11,974 --> 02:14:12,814
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

1891
02:14:33,359 --> 02:14:34,380
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1892
02:14:53,716 --> 02:14:59,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you can say, fuck you, you're not going to get to watch this because we're just going to be dicks about it.

1893
02:15:00,159 --> 02:15:06,903
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, you know, now you just pissed off a community and you're like, we're not buying your system or your game, so forget it.

1894
02:15:07,543 --> 02:15:09,144
[SPEAKER_12]: But then they'll buy the game because, you know, they have to have it.

1895
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:16,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw said that he heard that Super Smash Brothers Melee had over 130,000 people watching the live stream during the game's finals earlier today.

1896
02:15:16,963 --> 02:15:21,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the most watched fighting game in history, according to the co-founder of EVO.

1897
02:15:22,265 --> 02:15:24,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, because the whole thing did kind of work out in the game.

1898
02:15:24,685 --> 02:15:28,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think more people watched it because of this controversy.

1899
02:15:28,107 --> 02:15:30,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people wouldn't have had an idea this was happening.

1900
02:15:30,908 --> 02:15:31,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be honest.

1901
02:15:32,088 --> 02:15:33,069
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happened.

1902
02:15:33,409 --> 02:15:37,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, we have our smarties in chat saying Actdeft says play this way.

1903
02:15:38,154 --> 02:15:39,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says stream this way.

1904
02:15:41,858 --> 02:15:43,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, baby, there is no way.

1905
02:15:43,559 --> 02:15:45,061
[SPEAKER_04]: We will let you stream that game.

1906
02:15:45,241 --> 02:15:47,043
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot stream that game, no.

1907
02:15:48,539 --> 02:15:48,739
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1908
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:51,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried.

1909
02:15:52,721 --> 02:15:53,462
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

1910
02:15:53,562 --> 02:16:01,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, glad they worked it out, but legal department and big companies need to figure, you know, realize that this is the world we live in.

1911
02:16:02,667 --> 02:16:05,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yet another example of Nintendo does not understand the internet.

1912
02:16:06,589 --> 02:16:07,729
[SPEAKER_04]: This does not help their case.

1913
02:16:07,749 --> 02:16:10,411
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it, a series of tubes?

1914
02:16:10,491 --> 02:16:11,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, right, DarkSakura.

1915
02:16:12,272 --> 02:16:16,154
[SPEAKER_08]: It's these wires, and there's things on them, and they do stuff.

1916
02:16:16,610 --> 02:16:22,276
[SPEAKER_08]: How about a new franchise coming from Nintendo?

1917
02:16:22,296 --> 02:16:25,078
[SPEAKER_08]: This was actually voiced by Miyamoto.

1918
02:16:28,882 --> 02:16:35,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, he let it slip that there is going to be a new franchise, and he said this on the Japanese publication.

1919
02:16:36,229 --> 02:16:36,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1920
02:16:36,589 --> 02:16:36,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1921
02:16:56,812 --> 02:16:59,413
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad that they're coming up with new IP.

1922
02:16:59,994 --> 02:17:01,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Like the new IP that they launched the Wii system with.

1923
02:17:02,075 --> 02:17:04,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Excite Truck needs a sequel.

1924
02:17:04,796 --> 02:17:05,496
[SPEAKER_12]: A good sequel.

1925
02:17:05,757 --> 02:17:08,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not talking about Excite Bots because that was crap.

1926
02:17:08,258 --> 02:17:10,659
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't put minigames in the middle of a fucking race.

1927
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:11,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1928
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:15,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I shouldn't have to throw pie at a clown while I'm racing a car.

1929
02:17:17,282 --> 02:17:18,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I do that all the time.

1930
02:17:18,143 --> 02:17:19,403
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called going to Disneyland with Dan.

1931
02:17:20,324 --> 02:17:22,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Or make a sandwich.

1932
02:17:23,081 --> 02:17:28,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Literally, there was make a sandwich during Burger Time Racers.

1933
02:17:28,403 --> 02:17:30,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong, it's a funny idea.

1934
02:17:31,004 --> 02:17:33,846
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, in playing the game, you're just like, what the fuck?

1935
02:17:33,866 --> 02:17:39,468
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this is silly, but it's just... We need Warriors Wacky Races.

1936
02:17:40,088 --> 02:17:40,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't that be crazy?

1937
02:17:41,249 --> 02:17:46,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of a Mario Kart, do like a Wario Kart and have it be like just completely fucked up.

1938
02:17:46,616 --> 02:17:49,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this new Mario Kart 8, you're going upside down.

1939
02:17:49,498 --> 02:17:53,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 basically looks like F-Zero, which, like, it makes me happy.

1940
02:17:53,402 --> 02:17:54,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't we just have F-Zero?

1941
02:17:54,583 --> 02:17:57,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me really happy and really fucking irritated at the same time.

1942
02:17:58,306 --> 02:18:01,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Nintendo, you're fucking teasing me now.

1943
02:18:02,009 --> 02:18:02,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.

1944
02:18:02,449 --> 02:18:03,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo, wrong.

1945
02:18:04,891 --> 02:18:06,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for new IPs, though.

1946
02:18:06,373 --> 02:18:06,993
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, new IPs are fine.

1947
02:18:07,013 --> 02:18:11,537
[SPEAKER_04]: We built this wonderful engine for F-Zero, and then we're like, eh, no one wants F-Zero.

1948
02:18:11,637 --> 02:18:12,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody wants F-Zero.

1949
02:18:12,578 --> 02:18:13,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody wants that.

1950
02:18:14,386 --> 02:18:14,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, moving on.

1951
02:18:14,946 --> 02:18:15,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

1952
02:18:16,167 --> 02:18:16,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1953
02:18:17,027 --> 02:18:23,431
[SPEAKER_12]: So, uh, Desura has actually been purchased up by, um... What was it?

1954
02:18:23,651 --> 02:18:28,093
[SPEAKER_12]: The Second Life company, Linden Labs.

1955
02:18:28,413 --> 02:18:30,995
[SPEAKER_12]: And so... What's that mean?

1956
02:18:32,496 --> 02:18:33,476
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no fucking clue.

1957
02:18:34,557 --> 02:18:36,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Other than, you know, it's changed ownership.

1958
02:18:36,418 --> 02:18:41,540
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's really going to change anything as far as, you know, the distribution service goes.

1959
02:18:42,521 --> 02:18:42,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1960
02:18:44,201 --> 02:18:44,882
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it's interesting.

1961
02:18:44,902 --> 02:18:50,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Second Life will become like PlayStation Home and you can launch games within Second Life.

1962
02:18:51,048 --> 02:18:55,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Except with a lot more furry... No, actually it is exactly like PlayStation Home.

1963
02:18:55,072 --> 02:18:56,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly like PlayStation Home.

1964
02:18:56,233 --> 02:18:59,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be very meta because like PlayStation Home was kind of inspired by Second Life.

1965
02:18:59,937 --> 02:19:03,460
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are flying dicks in Second Life and not in PlayStation Home.

1966
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:05,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there are dicks in PlayStation Home.

1967
02:19:06,323 --> 02:19:07,364
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not flying though.

1968
02:19:08,825 --> 02:19:09,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have rocket packs?

1969
02:19:12,728 --> 02:19:21,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you can file this in, you know, I don't know if this is rule 37 or what, but this is just the gaming community at work here.

1970
02:19:21,834 --> 02:19:34,103
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a petition going around telling Microsoft, or I should say asking, demanding that Microsoft bring back the restrictive DRM policies that they had already rescinded due to outrage.

1971
02:19:34,143 --> 02:19:37,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there are fans petitioning Microsoft to bring it back.

1972
02:19:38,325 --> 02:19:44,468
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a petition posted on Change.org I hate that site Why do you hate Change.org?

1973
02:19:44,588 --> 02:19:57,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you sign any petition on there and you get 50,000 spam emails from them And yeah, I'm all good for signing petitions, but not on that site I will not sign a single one on that site

1974
02:19:57,938 --> 02:19:59,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here's the petition.

1975
02:20:23,962 --> 02:20:28,307
[SPEAKER_04]: to whoever, give us back the Xbox One we were promised at E3.

1976
02:20:28,387 --> 02:20:29,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Sincerely, your name.

1977
02:20:30,289 --> 02:20:34,052
[SPEAKER_04]: They have hit 24,476 signatures.

1978
02:20:34,233 --> 02:20:38,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and a lot of those are just troll signatures too, by the way, because they're like, yeah, we want them to do this.

1979
02:20:39,218 --> 02:20:45,704
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm sorry, once again, comparing the digital marketplace that Xbox One would have to Steam is just stupid.

1980
02:20:46,826 --> 02:20:51,931
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a perfect example of the difference right now with the Steam sale.

1981
02:20:51,991 --> 02:20:56,035
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, you see a lot of discounts on Steam.

1982
02:20:57,657 --> 02:21:00,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Steam is not the only place you can get Steam games.

1983
02:21:00,841 --> 02:21:08,349
[SPEAKER_12]: You can get Steam games or Steam DRM-enabled games on Amazon, Greenman Gaming...

1984
02:21:08,889 --> 02:21:10,190
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1985
02:21:29,830 --> 02:21:31,631
[SPEAKER_04]: and we still don't know what the fucking details were on that.

1986
02:21:31,651 --> 02:21:33,153
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what pisses me off about this too.

1987
02:21:33,253 --> 02:21:35,694
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know what the fuck you're complaining about.

1988
02:21:36,875 --> 02:21:41,959
[SPEAKER_04]: All 24,000 of you, you literally do not know what the fuck you're complaining about.

1989
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:46,983
[SPEAKER_04]: They never said what the rules were.

1990
02:21:49,004 --> 02:21:58,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if it was that one hour demo thing... I know this is a show where every gamer has a voice and I welcome every opinion but I can literally say this petition is ignorant.

1991
02:22:00,450 --> 02:22:06,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of ignorant and change.org, I have been informed that they no longer send out the emails.

1992
02:22:06,695 --> 02:22:06,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1993
02:22:06,995 --> 02:22:07,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good.

1994
02:22:09,116 --> 02:22:09,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1995
02:22:09,397 --> 02:22:11,358
[SPEAKER_04]: You just fessed up to your own ignorance here on the show.

1996
02:22:11,498 --> 02:22:11,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens.

1997
02:22:12,078 --> 02:22:13,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's because I ignored them for a while.

1998
02:22:13,620 --> 02:22:14,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't care.

1999
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:15,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Ignore ignorant.

2000
02:22:16,261 --> 02:22:17,222
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, same word.

2001
02:22:17,242 --> 02:22:18,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Same combination.

2002
02:22:20,086 --> 02:22:20,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Humblebundle.

2003
02:22:20,586 --> 02:22:23,847
[SPEAKER_12]: There's another perfect example of places you can get Steam games for dirt cheap.

2004
02:22:24,368 --> 02:22:27,028
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying that's the problem.

2005
02:22:28,029 --> 02:22:39,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Even comparing the PlayStation Network store or Xbox Live Marketplace to Steam is just ridiculous because it's not an open platform as far as you're not going to have competing marketplaces out there.

2006
02:22:39,593 --> 02:22:42,514
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not like the retail marketplace where everyone's competing with each other.

2007
02:22:42,794 --> 02:22:44,394
[SPEAKER_12]: You have one central marketplace.

2008
02:22:45,215 --> 02:22:47,335
[SPEAKER_12]: You buy it their way or you don't buy it at all.

2009
02:22:47,516 --> 02:22:47,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Origin.

2010
02:22:50,065 --> 02:22:55,608
[SPEAKER_04]: ShadowNextGen in our chat says, Sky, couldn't it be said that people originally didn't really know what they were complaining about?

2011
02:22:56,008 --> 02:22:58,569
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, no, I haven't signed the petition, nor do I plan to.

2012
02:22:58,749 --> 02:23:00,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the devil's advocate perspective.

2013
02:23:00,890 --> 02:23:02,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're an Xbox fan.

2014
02:23:02,831 --> 02:23:05,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And unlike some of these people, I do think you do know what you're talking about.

2015
02:23:05,552 --> 02:23:06,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me humor this opinion here.

2016
02:23:07,653 --> 02:23:10,254
[SPEAKER_04]: about didn't we not originally know what we were complaining about.

2017
02:23:10,394 --> 02:23:11,194
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we did.

2018
02:23:11,514 --> 02:23:15,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox made it very clear about the restrictions that they were putting into place.

2019
02:23:16,316 --> 02:23:18,016
[SPEAKER_04]: They had three pages of it.

2020
02:23:18,056 --> 02:23:20,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was that whole official letter they put out there.

2021
02:23:20,357 --> 02:23:21,157
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very clear.

2022
02:23:21,197 --> 02:23:22,498
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no misinterpreting that.

2023
02:23:22,898 --> 02:23:25,279
[SPEAKER_04]: You will have to check in once every 24 hours.

2024
02:23:25,699 --> 02:23:29,860
[SPEAKER_04]: You will only be able to trade and use games through authorized vendors and all this stuff.

2025
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:31,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was in writing.

2026
02:23:32,721 --> 02:23:40,828
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can read between the lines and see that that meant that you would not be able to sell games yourself on eBay and so on and so on.

2027
02:23:41,208 --> 02:23:46,572
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is what they didn't communicate was the positive to offset that negative.

2028
02:23:47,213 --> 02:23:49,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Family sharing was this big cloud out there.

2029
02:23:49,595 --> 02:23:52,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten people in your house can play the games but how?

2030
02:23:53,318 --> 02:23:54,238
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the terms?

2031
02:23:54,579 --> 02:23:58,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's literally people out there and I bet you the people signing this petition think

2032
02:23:59,076 --> 02:24:14,862
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was share with people across the internet the full unhinged complete game 10 people playing it all at once now we can all pool in on our game sales I don't think any of you think that listening to this but I think there were people out there that really think that

2033
02:24:15,402 --> 02:24:17,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they thought that they could share games.

2034
02:24:17,663 --> 02:24:25,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hey, I'm only going to have to pay $6 for this Xbox One game, and all my nine other friends are going to chip in as well, and we can all play this game.

2035
02:24:25,268 --> 02:24:26,489
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm sorry, that's not the way it works.

2036
02:24:26,549 --> 02:24:30,211
[SPEAKER_04]: When in reality, it was probably like the GIMP to Drive Club thing, honestly.

2037
02:24:30,251 --> 02:24:37,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, people, do you really think that Microsoft would legitimately put out a service like that, that they would stand to lose money on?

2038
02:24:38,758 --> 02:24:52,836
[SPEAKER_04]: and they got beat by Sony Sony took advantage of this yes they did take advantage of this situation that is business and it's the it's to be fair it's the exact flip of seven years ago when PlayStation embarrassed themselves at E3

2039
02:24:54,357 --> 02:24:58,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I wanted to read this comment to... Where was it?

2040
02:24:58,179 --> 02:24:58,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

2041
02:24:58,519 --> 02:25:02,680
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very important from Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.

2042
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:06,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Official quote from anti-consumer Blackwolf with his quotey fingers.

2043
02:25:07,462 --> 02:25:08,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck those fans.

2044
02:25:10,443 --> 02:25:11,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Bobby.

2045
02:25:12,724 --> 02:25:14,365
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll end on that note.

2046
02:25:15,145 --> 02:25:17,726
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on to the mailbag.

2047
02:25:19,174 --> 02:25:21,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

2048
02:25:21,295 --> 02:25:25,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are one of those people that signed that petition, I invite you to come at me, bro.

2049
02:25:25,976 --> 02:25:33,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com In all seriousness, I can be respectful if you want to have a respectful discussion.

2050
02:25:35,679 --> 02:25:38,060
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to admit that the petition is a little silly at this point.

2051
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:38,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Just let it be.

2052
02:25:38,860 --> 02:25:40,161
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an online petition.

2053
02:25:40,221 --> 02:25:40,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

2054
02:25:41,381 --> 02:25:41,821
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2055
02:25:41,941 --> 02:25:42,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait.

2056
02:25:42,321 --> 02:25:42,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Before the mailbag.

2057
02:25:43,042 --> 02:25:43,582
[SPEAKER_04]: This is important.

2058
02:25:44,362 --> 02:25:46,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I would fully support, fully support

2059
02:25:47,503 --> 02:25:54,906
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think this is what those people would want so before you write your angry email I'm going to meet you halfway here I would be totally okay with this

2060
02:25:55,663 --> 02:25:59,446
[SPEAKER_04]: with a physical disc license and a digital download license.

2061
02:26:00,166 --> 02:26:10,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to buy your game on physical disc, then game sharing and all that stuff works the way you know it today, and everything is just like that shady PlayStation video and all that, everything you know and love about games.

2062
02:26:11,414 --> 02:26:15,237
[SPEAKER_04]: But a digital download license would give you something different.

2063
02:26:15,638 --> 02:26:21,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of the place gaming ought to go, is that if you download a game... But you have the freedom to choose.

2064
02:26:21,442 --> 02:26:22,322
[SPEAKER_04]: You get these perks.

2065
02:26:23,343 --> 02:26:45,432
[SPEAKER_04]: your perk for buying the game digitally is you get it day one you can buy the game without pants you won't have to leave your house and you can give that game to a friend in New York or something cross country it would have these different licenses I am totally okay with that and I would be behind Xbox One 100% with that I just don't think it's going to happen

2066
02:26:46,590 --> 02:26:47,711
[SPEAKER_12]: And they can always come back.

2067
02:26:47,791 --> 02:26:50,933
[SPEAKER_12]: They said that later on they may implement some of the stuff that they got rid of.

2068
02:26:51,153 --> 02:26:54,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully none of the bad things, but you know.

2069
02:26:54,635 --> 02:26:58,077
[SPEAKER_08]: They could just be there trying to find a way to integrate something that won't scare people off.

2070
02:26:58,157 --> 02:27:02,520
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can't support a petition that is like, switch it back to the way it was because everyone's stupid.

2071
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:03,701
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't like it.

2072
02:27:03,761 --> 02:27:04,682
[SPEAKER_06]: We want it this way.

2073
02:27:05,822 --> 02:27:08,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Daddy, I want the goose that lays the golden eggs.

2074
02:27:09,099 --> 02:27:10,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the world I want the whole world

2075
02:27:25,765 --> 02:27:30,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear OLR, I just wanted to say, as always, that you have an awesome show.

2076
02:27:31,269 --> 02:27:34,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to share with you a game I recently acquired on Steam.

2077
02:27:34,151 --> 02:27:37,573
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Akaniero Demon Hunters.

2078
02:27:38,513 --> 02:27:42,056
[SPEAKER_08]: It plays a lot like Okami in the sense that you get shards for each demon you kill.

2079
02:27:42,096 --> 02:27:44,377
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the storyline... Learn to spell.

2080
02:27:45,738 --> 02:27:46,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2081
02:27:47,179 --> 02:27:47,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Straight.

2082
02:27:47,819 --> 02:27:49,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Not with an E, with an A. From Steam.

2083
02:27:50,961 --> 02:27:54,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not very good at descriptions, so I took this one from the official game site.

2084
02:27:55,244 --> 02:28:04,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Akaneiro Demon Hunters transports you to a world realized in a striking visual style inspired by Japanese ink, water, and woodblock illustration.

2085
02:28:05,089 --> 02:28:09,793
[SPEAKER_08]: We've dug deep into the history and folklore of Japan when designing our scenarios and characters.

2086
02:28:12,054 --> 02:28:19,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Mixing this foundation with an original mythology inspired by Red Riding Hood has yielded a fantastic and inspiring setting for players to explore.

2087
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:26,325
[SPEAKER_08]: It was produced, I think, by Spicy Horse, who was in charge of American McGee's Alice Madness Returns, which is another awesome game, by the way.

2088
02:28:26,745 --> 02:28:28,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you guys can check it out.

2089
02:28:28,066 --> 02:28:29,587
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on Steam for $10 now.

2090
02:28:29,968 --> 02:28:31,069
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphics are stunning.

2091
02:28:31,109 --> 02:28:34,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminded me a lot of Okami, as it looks like drawings on the screen.

2092
02:28:34,631 --> 02:28:36,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys get to check it out sometime.

2093
02:28:36,893 --> 02:28:39,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And as always, happy gaming and thanks for letting every gamer have a voice.

2094
02:28:39,515 --> 02:28:40,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely, Gigi.

2095
02:28:41,136 --> 02:28:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

2096
02:28:42,017 --> 02:28:42,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2097
02:28:42,757 --> 02:28:44,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have to give it a try if I have money.

2098
02:28:45,700 --> 02:28:49,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I like hearing about game reviews about games I haven't really heard a lot of.

2099
02:28:49,222 --> 02:28:49,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you.

2100
02:28:50,403 --> 02:28:52,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2101
02:28:52,505 --> 02:28:52,985
[SPEAKER_08]: This comes from...

2102
02:28:55,675 --> 02:28:58,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Rob, I got caught up in the same trading cards thingy.

2103
02:28:59,356 --> 02:29:01,237
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to be never-ending.

2104
02:29:01,297 --> 02:29:06,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for fun, I bought my missing binding of Isaac's cards.

2105
02:29:06,499 --> 02:29:07,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I converted them to a badge.

2106
02:29:07,780 --> 02:29:13,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only did that eat all the cards, I got a booster pack soon with more binding of Isaac cards.

2107
02:29:13,482 --> 02:29:16,403
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the cards was a foil, and so now I have a foil badge to collect.

2108
02:29:17,123 --> 02:29:23,046
[SPEAKER_08]: The regular trading cards can power up my existing badge, so there's no reason for selling or trading cards unless they're duplicates.

2109
02:29:24,146 --> 02:29:27,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I was using $5 of my own money plus selling my duplicates to obtain a full set.

2110
02:29:28,271 --> 02:29:30,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have almost $3 left over.

2111
02:29:30,253 --> 02:29:34,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Pro tip, don't try buying the cards at the top of the queue on the marketplace.

2112
02:29:34,297 --> 02:29:36,940
[SPEAKER_08]: It will most likely be gone before you can complete your transaction.

2113
02:29:37,761 --> 02:29:40,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the trading card system was running...

2114
02:29:45,073 --> 02:29:49,237
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 to 5 July, and maybe the 2nd through the 5th July because I paid for hours and got no drops.

2115
02:29:50,518 --> 02:29:51,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I played for hours and got no drops.

2116
02:29:52,139 --> 02:29:54,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, the cards are worth zooming in on.

2117
02:29:54,021 --> 02:29:56,683
[SPEAKER_08]: The Fairy Solitaire cards are actually panoramas from the game.

2118
02:29:57,143 --> 02:30:01,527
[SPEAKER_08]: The artwork will probably look way better zoomed in, and that's from Addictra-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

2119
02:30:01,707 --> 02:30:03,088
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2120
02:30:30,485 --> 02:30:32,786
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, yeah, the trading card thing is fun.

2121
02:30:33,006 --> 02:30:37,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Ranma, for doing trading cards with me last week or this last week.

2122
02:30:38,328 --> 02:30:39,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma sent an email that just said 573.

2123
02:30:40,988 --> 02:30:44,149
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we hit.

2124
02:30:44,250 --> 02:30:44,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we hit it?

2125
02:30:44,930 --> 02:30:45,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, maybe we did.

2126
02:30:46,650 --> 02:30:47,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ranma.

2127
02:30:48,171 --> 02:30:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking now.

2128
02:30:50,185 --> 02:30:54,889
[SPEAKER_08]: We have another email that I'm just going to go ahead and read it but I'm not going to say the guy's full name.

2129
02:30:55,430 --> 02:30:55,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2130
02:30:56,050 --> 02:31:02,096
[SPEAKER_08]: So my name is Jeff G and I've worked at an ESPN affiliate radio station for three years.

2131
02:31:02,516 --> 02:31:03,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played video games since I can remember.

2132
02:31:04,057 --> 02:31:08,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I am interested in video games radio and would love to send in my resume and some clips of me on air.

2133
02:31:08,461 --> 02:31:10,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, we're not hiring because we don't pay anything.

2134
02:31:12,204 --> 02:31:13,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see this email, really.

2135
02:31:14,987 --> 02:31:19,310
[SPEAKER_08]: If nothing comes of this email, I would still like to commend you for living the dream of talking about video games.

2136
02:31:19,711 --> 02:31:22,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

2137
02:31:22,373 --> 02:31:23,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, bless your heart, sir.

2138
02:31:25,735 --> 02:31:27,637
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could afford to pay, we would be paid.

2139
02:31:27,897 --> 02:31:33,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, unfortunately, this is an all-volunteer organization, but I will throw this out there.

2140
02:31:34,162 --> 02:31:36,263
[SPEAKER_04]: VOG is looking for more shows.

2141
02:31:36,504 --> 02:31:43,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're looking for established shows because we want to make sure that the people we recruit aren't going to throw in the towel after you.

2142
02:31:43,488 --> 02:31:46,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look to the site's credit at Voice of Geeks Network.

2143
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:48,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had the same lineup for like a year.

2144
02:31:49,471 --> 02:31:49,892
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

2145
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:11,933
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do have a show that's interested in being on the network, get in touch with me directly, rob at vognetwork.com.

2146
02:32:28,983 --> 02:32:34,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love a board game, card game, like non-video game type show.

2147
02:32:34,268 --> 02:32:42,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you think about, I would love, love, love a show that is like LARPing live or like playing a game live, one of those types of shows.

2148
02:32:42,976 --> 02:32:44,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It would make a great serial.

2149
02:32:45,519 --> 02:32:46,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So just throwing that out there.

2150
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:51,044
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have an established show along those lines, get in touch with me, rob at vognetwork.com.

2151
02:32:51,965 --> 02:32:53,086
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll see what we can do.

2152
02:32:57,045 --> 02:33:01,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I invite this guy to just call our show some night.

2153
02:33:02,107 --> 02:33:04,407
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're around on a Sunday night, give our show a call.

2154
02:33:04,647 --> 02:33:05,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2155
02:33:05,408 --> 02:33:06,808
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be happy to talk video games with you.

2156
02:33:07,188 --> 02:33:07,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And who knows?

2157
02:33:07,768 --> 02:33:09,309
[SPEAKER_08]: For free.

2158
02:33:09,569 --> 02:33:14,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And who knows, you know, you might find your niche in the geekdom market, too.

2159
02:33:15,510 --> 02:33:16,811
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we might...

2160
02:33:17,932 --> 02:33:19,295
[SPEAKER_08]: There's sports geeks out there.

2161
02:33:19,315 --> 02:33:22,001
[SPEAKER_08]: You said you worked for ESPN affiliates, so who knows?

2162
02:33:22,522 --> 02:33:26,131
[SPEAKER_08]: We got sports geek talk, as long as there's no wrestling, because that would drive Bobby crazy.

2163
02:33:29,557 --> 02:33:30,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's like 80s wrestling.

2164
02:33:30,818 --> 02:33:32,019
[SPEAKER_04]: How could that drive anybody crazy?

2165
02:33:32,279 --> 02:33:32,919
[SPEAKER_04]: 80s wrestling was the best.

2166
02:33:32,939 --> 02:33:37,602
[SPEAKER_08]: And your theme song has to be Hulk Hogan's I am a real American.

2167
02:33:37,622 --> 02:33:39,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, anyway.

2168
02:33:39,823 --> 02:33:41,825
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get to the FUs of the week.

2169
02:33:42,545 --> 02:33:49,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week here on the show we... Oh, by the way, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you would like to send in your mail, please, no resumes.

2170
02:33:50,950 --> 02:33:54,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Here's the FUs of the week time.

2171
02:34:10,246 --> 02:34:11,907
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to Bitchface.

2172
02:34:13,707 --> 02:34:14,868
[SPEAKER_08]: She doesn't listen to the show.

2173
02:34:15,428 --> 02:34:16,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people know who Bitchface is.

2174
02:34:17,809 --> 02:34:18,089
[SPEAKER_08]: FU.

2175
02:34:19,149 --> 02:34:19,869
[SPEAKER_08]: And also my hip.

2176
02:34:21,950 --> 02:34:24,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And the stupid cough that I am now going on to week five.

2177
02:34:26,392 --> 02:34:26,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck.

2178
02:34:28,352 --> 02:34:28,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Done.

2179
02:34:29,513 --> 02:34:29,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Loki.

2180
02:34:30,753 --> 02:34:31,674
[SPEAKER_12]: FU to Tension and Headaches.

2181
02:34:31,994 --> 02:34:33,334
[SPEAKER_12]: I always get them.

2182
02:34:34,415 --> 02:34:35,355
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have one now.

2183
02:34:36,539 --> 02:34:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna follow that up with my own F.U.

2184
02:34:39,201 --> 02:34:43,965
[SPEAKER_04]: to headaches, because I had a really bad one yesterday that pretty much ruined my day.

2185
02:34:44,165 --> 02:34:46,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that, but I guess shit happens.

2186
02:34:46,987 --> 02:34:48,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley, do you have any F.U.s you want to get off your chest?

2187
02:34:49,289 --> 02:34:49,429
[SPEAKER_10]: F.U.

2188
02:34:49,449 --> 02:34:52,792
[SPEAKER_10]: to my back for hurting after a California stream yesterday.

2189
02:34:52,812 --> 02:34:58,436
[SPEAKER_10]: And then seriously, fuck you to this douchebag Wingstopper's boy.

2190
02:34:58,456 --> 02:35:02,979
[SPEAKER_10]: He said they wouldn't take my order because it's getting late at 10.30 when I ordered after 11, like, several times.

2191
02:35:06,642 --> 02:35:07,762
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is.

2192
02:35:07,802 --> 02:35:09,363
[SPEAKER_10]: FUs of the Week.

2193
02:35:34,441 --> 02:35:38,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with a couple more news stories and then you guys can give us a call in a moment here.

2194
02:35:39,324 --> 02:35:39,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

2195
02:35:40,545 --> 02:35:45,288
[SPEAKER_12]: You remember a time when Sony's online network was hacked?

2196
02:35:46,109 --> 02:35:47,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Pepperidge Farm remembers.

2197
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:50,112
[SPEAKER_12]: And Sony, they...

2198
02:35:52,381 --> 02:35:54,543
[SPEAKER_12]: They basically got fined in the UK.

2199
02:35:55,364 --> 02:36:03,091
[SPEAKER_12]: They had to pay a £250,000 fine and they were originally appealing it.

2200
02:36:03,452 --> 02:36:06,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they decided they're going to withdraw that.

2201
02:36:06,414 --> 02:36:09,858
[SPEAKER_12]: So after careful consideration, we are withdrawing our appeal.

2202
02:36:10,178 --> 02:36:15,343
[SPEAKER_12]: This decision reflects our commitment to protecting the confidentiality of our network security from disclosures.

2203
02:36:15,964 --> 02:36:23,015
[SPEAKER_12]: We continue to disagree with the decision on the merits.

2204
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:28,845
[SPEAKER_12]: They disagree, but they're going to pay for it.

2205
02:36:30,427 --> 02:36:33,268
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't like this, but we'll do it anyway.

2206
02:36:33,809 --> 02:36:47,535
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm wondering if they did appeal it that they would go, maybe there would be some sort of trial where information would come out about how shoddy their protection was and they didn't want that, so they decided to go ahead and pay the original settlement or something.

2207
02:36:47,595 --> 02:36:48,236
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, whatever.

2208
02:36:49,176 --> 02:36:49,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

2209
02:36:49,876 --> 02:36:50,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Water in the bridge.

2210
02:36:51,437 --> 02:36:51,757
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2211
02:36:53,099 --> 02:36:56,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the entire gaming community had probably already forgotten about the hack.

2212
02:36:56,501 --> 02:36:57,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Never forget.

2213
02:36:58,343 --> 02:37:00,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't say the entire community, but a big chunk of them.

2214
02:37:01,425 --> 02:37:05,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragenator said, how about a show that combines wrestling, bronies, and furries?

2215
02:37:05,909 --> 02:37:07,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said that sounds like really bad porn.

2216
02:37:07,911 --> 02:37:10,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that be Dogpile?

2217
02:37:10,453 --> 02:37:12,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It will air at 3 a.m.

2218
02:37:12,394 --> 02:37:13,375
[SPEAKER_04]: on Tuesday morning.

2219
02:37:16,218 --> 02:37:25,246
[SPEAKER_08]: All joking aside, as much as I say we're kind of full up on video game shows right now, I would love to see a Mega Man show.

2220
02:37:25,306 --> 02:37:26,687
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, but anyway...

2221
02:37:35,134 --> 02:37:45,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man is a diehard community, and the community makes a lot of great fan projects, and one of them is on its way out, Mega Man Revolution.

2222
02:37:45,877 --> 02:37:46,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been in development since 2002.

2223
02:37:48,598 --> 02:37:51,378
[SPEAKER_04]: It tries to recreate the magic of the NES games.

2224
02:37:51,398 --> 02:37:53,979
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also, I guess, enable slowdown and so forth.

2225
02:37:54,919 --> 02:37:56,180
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of early reaction.

2226
02:37:56,420 --> 02:37:57,340
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is too hard.

2227
02:37:58,160 --> 02:37:58,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

2228
02:38:15,663 --> 02:38:15,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

2229
02:38:39,566 --> 02:38:40,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

2230
02:38:40,427 --> 02:38:44,870
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean to stop liking us on Facebook because the next goal would be, what would it be?

2231
02:38:44,970 --> 02:38:45,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably like 5,730?

2232
02:38:46,612 --> 02:38:49,474
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it would be 1,337.

2233
02:38:49,774 --> 02:38:50,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

2234
02:38:50,575 --> 02:38:53,377
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an admirable goal.

2235
02:38:53,397 --> 02:39:00,222
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, Mega Man Revolution, I would mention that there is also Mega Man Unlimited, which was released today.

2236
02:39:01,163 --> 02:39:03,524
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can download that at megafillx.com.

2237
02:39:05,792 --> 02:39:08,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that Phil like a dude named Phil or Phil like F-I-L-L?

2238
02:39:09,023 --> 02:39:10,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Phil like a dude named Phil.

2239
02:39:10,368 --> 02:39:11,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.

2240
02:39:12,853 --> 02:39:24,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty, I guess that is about it for the show, but we do want to take an opportunity to open up our Skype line for you guys to have your say on anything we've talked about tonight or maybe something we missed.

2241
02:39:24,338 --> 02:39:33,302
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you'd like to give us a call and we'll talk about whatever you'd like, within reason.

2242
02:39:34,502 --> 02:39:38,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to some Twitter topics and last minute stories while we wait for those to come in.

2243
02:39:40,014 --> 02:39:40,635
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2244
02:39:59,051 --> 02:40:06,838
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, there's one character that's a fish, a fish man, and all he can do is flop around.

2245
02:40:07,739 --> 02:40:11,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Zombie Bride, Giant Preen Mantis, Average Run-of-the-Mill Old Man.

2246
02:40:13,044 --> 02:40:14,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, he's an old man who can't fight.

2247
02:40:14,605 --> 02:40:15,766
[SPEAKER_12]: What about Middle-Aged Man?

2248
02:40:15,866 --> 02:40:16,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And Female Paul.

2249
02:40:17,207 --> 02:40:20,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get to the phones, because the phones are ringing here.

2250
02:40:20,811 --> 02:40:21,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2251
02:40:21,711 --> 02:40:22,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2252
02:40:23,007 --> 02:40:23,467
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Jason.

2253
02:40:23,688 --> 02:40:24,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Jason.

2254
02:40:24,288 --> 02:40:24,809
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

2255
02:40:24,889 --> 02:40:25,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jason.

2256
02:40:25,429 --> 02:40:27,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we go back to Nostalgia Land?

2257
02:40:27,571 --> 02:40:28,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course we can.

2258
02:40:29,372 --> 02:40:30,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Nostalgia Land.

2259
02:40:30,714 --> 02:40:37,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I was driving back from a friend's concert and you guys were talking and we're going to the mailbag and I was just driving along the highway just going, ah.

2260
02:40:39,521 --> 02:40:40,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

2261
02:40:40,422 --> 02:40:40,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2262
02:40:40,782 --> 02:40:44,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to build a house out of pixels in Nostalgia Land and live there.

2263
02:40:44,425 --> 02:40:44,865
[SPEAKER_04]: A fort.

2264
02:40:45,066 --> 02:40:47,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I will have my pixel fort in Nostalgia Land.

2265
02:40:47,668 --> 02:40:49,229
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to talk about in Nostalgia Land?

2266
02:40:49,249 --> 02:40:50,050
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes you nostalgic?

2267
02:40:50,070 --> 02:40:50,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.

2268
02:40:51,089 --> 02:40:51,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Prop Cycle.

2269
02:40:52,890 --> 02:40:53,431
[SPEAKER_04]: They had one!

2270
02:40:53,711 --> 02:40:55,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Prop Cycle's awesome.

2271
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:56,613
[SPEAKER_04]: They had one.

2272
02:40:56,693 --> 02:40:58,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Not in the Prop Cycle Addams Family, but they had a Prop Cycle.

2273
02:40:59,395 --> 02:41:02,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, some of our listeners don't know what Prop Cycle is, so please explain it.

2274
02:41:04,147 --> 02:41:06,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Prop Cycle was an exercise game.

2275
02:41:06,528 --> 02:41:15,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Essentially, you sat on an exercise bike that had a two-handed flight stick, and you could tilt it forward, pull it back, obviously turn right and left.

2276
02:41:16,989 --> 02:41:31,432
[SPEAKER_11]: You couldn't just crank the pedals continuously because the game... I think it was basically like exertion prevention built into the game, but you just pedaled persistently and flew around popping balloons and not crashing into things.

2277
02:41:32,620 --> 02:41:33,061
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2278
02:41:33,281 --> 02:41:34,402
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just a lot of fun to play.

2279
02:41:34,462 --> 02:41:35,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so silly looking too.

2280
02:41:35,563 --> 02:41:36,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so fun.

2281
02:41:36,864 --> 02:41:42,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Rio Rancho, my hometown, doesn't actually have a mall still to this day.

2282
02:41:44,091 --> 02:41:48,435
[SPEAKER_11]: The mall that got closest to us, Cottonwood Mall, is just on the other side of the city limit border.

2283
02:41:49,737 --> 02:41:55,142
[SPEAKER_11]: But when that was first built up, the movie theater downstairs had a very tiny little arcade.

2284
02:41:55,182 --> 02:41:55,682
[SPEAKER_11]: It had a...

2285
02:41:56,343 --> 02:42:01,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Metal Slug, I want to say a Neo Geo Multicab, and a couple of other typical things.

2286
02:42:02,107 --> 02:42:08,591
[SPEAKER_11]: But upstairs, for the first couple of years of that mall's existence, there was a divided laser tag?

2287
02:42:10,207 --> 02:42:32,610
[SPEAKER_11]: a divided laser tag meaning that you can't cross into the other person's territory and it had Sega City and that was like with the exception of the roller rink that we used to go to when I was younger way the hell out in Albuquerque Sega City was like my personal arcade back in the day and that's where I played Prop Cycle and it was one of those things where whenever we would go I would play that and it

2288
02:42:33,251 --> 02:42:33,812
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.com.

2289
02:42:52,928 --> 02:42:53,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Ugh.

2290
02:42:54,409 --> 02:42:55,430
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was a great game.

2291
02:42:55,510 --> 02:42:59,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I've literally never seen that in any other arcade to my mind, to my memory.

2292
02:42:59,813 --> 02:43:03,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they have, like, these weird hacks for Prop Cycle where they hook up Prop Cycle to other games?

2293
02:43:03,996 --> 02:43:06,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, wouldn't there, like, even, like, a pinball game that ran off Prop Cycle?

2294
02:43:07,538 --> 02:43:19,786
[SPEAKER_11]: As a matter of fact, my friends out here in Colorado, before I moved out here, hooked up a poppin' music of some sort to the proppin', uh, proppin', the Prop Cycle TV.

2295
02:43:19,886 --> 02:43:21,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was called, they called, they dubbed it proppin' music.

2296
02:43:22,028 --> 02:43:22,608
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

2297
02:43:23,349 --> 02:43:27,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I never, I unfortunately wasn't up here for the occasion but I saw pictures and it was definitely amazing.

2298
02:43:28,077 --> 02:43:28,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

2299
02:43:29,499 --> 02:43:32,664
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one game, so I've never known the name of this game.

2300
02:43:32,764 --> 02:43:32,924
[SPEAKER_11]: My...

2301
02:43:34,318 --> 02:43:39,743
[SPEAKER_11]: My brain does really weird things when specific details of things go away.

2302
02:43:40,023 --> 02:43:42,425
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wonder if you guys know this arcade game.

2303
02:43:43,225 --> 02:43:46,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I seem to remember it in the roller skating rink that I used to go to as a kid.

2304
02:43:47,969 --> 02:43:54,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, what it boils down to is you play on... You're a character that runs around a...

2305
02:43:56,276 --> 02:44:00,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Rollercoaster collecting cherries and you have to dodge the rollercoaster.

2306
02:44:00,458 --> 02:44:03,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never been able to find the actual cars on the rollercoaster.

2307
02:44:03,639 --> 02:44:05,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never been able to find this game.

2308
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:06,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that Mr. Dew's Wild Ride?

2309
02:44:07,321 --> 02:44:09,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Dew's Wild Ride.

2310
02:44:09,862 --> 02:44:10,482
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like it.

2311
02:44:10,522 --> 02:44:12,163
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're collecting cherries, it's Mr. Dew.

2312
02:44:14,212 --> 02:44:17,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, Wikipedia, give me a screenshot and not just the box art.

2313
02:44:17,875 --> 02:44:18,755
[SPEAKER_11]: No, the box art doesn't.

2314
02:44:19,456 --> 02:44:25,640
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, this is the thing that I kind of run into is that the image is ridiculously small.

2315
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:34,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I seem to remember it being very, very circular with ladders that connect you to the different portions where this looks like.

2316
02:44:34,647 --> 02:44:35,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost positive.

2317
02:44:35,668 --> 02:44:36,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Google.

2318
02:44:36,748 --> 02:44:37,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out on Google.

2319
02:44:38,529 --> 02:44:41,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Do a Google search.

2320
02:44:42,251 --> 02:44:53,676
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so weird because my brain... Filling in the gaps now that I actually have game screenshots, this kind of seems to make sense.

2321
02:44:54,477 --> 02:44:56,858
[SPEAKER_11]: But my brain remembers this game looking...

2322
02:44:58,038 --> 02:44:59,119
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit better, I guess?

2323
02:44:59,960 --> 02:45:02,242
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit newer than this actually is?

2324
02:45:02,502 --> 02:45:05,125
[SPEAKER_04]: The resolution on old games is going to be itty-bitty.

2325
02:45:05,725 --> 02:45:06,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course.

2326
02:45:06,406 --> 02:45:07,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I think that's part of it.

2327
02:45:07,847 --> 02:45:08,888
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the raster.

2328
02:45:10,210 --> 02:45:14,894
[SPEAKER_11]: The detail of this thing just seems... What I remember and what this looks like is entirely different.

2329
02:45:15,034 --> 02:45:15,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.

2330
02:45:31,233 --> 02:45:33,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at Rob's image search.

2331
02:45:33,334 --> 02:45:37,155
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like all these screen captures and then there's a really badly drawn cock.

2332
02:45:37,715 --> 02:45:39,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It says you mad on it.

2333
02:45:40,116 --> 02:45:41,756
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that have to do with Mr. Dew's wild ride?

2334
02:45:41,796 --> 02:45:42,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2335
02:45:42,497 --> 02:45:43,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Google Images.

2336
02:45:43,557 --> 02:45:44,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Google Images.

2337
02:45:45,117 --> 02:45:47,078
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I get for turning safe search off.

2338
02:45:48,458 --> 02:45:50,059
[SPEAKER_04]: No one wants to search safe.

2339
02:45:50,219 --> 02:45:50,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

2340
02:45:50,659 --> 02:45:53,060
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't have your search for cock interfered.

2341
02:45:55,478 --> 02:45:56,038
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2342
02:46:14,833 --> 02:46:15,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to play that again.

2343
02:46:36,761 --> 02:46:37,941
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like a choose-your-game.

2344
02:46:38,222 --> 02:46:45,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was a choose-your-game, and you could play either Pac-Man or Dig Dug, and I want to say... I want to say they have one at the Roseville Dave & Buster's.

2345
02:46:45,404 --> 02:46:45,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

2346
02:46:46,664 --> 02:46:47,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say.

2347
02:46:48,385 --> 02:46:49,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I've seen one.

2348
02:46:49,465 --> 02:46:51,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know where I can get the name wrong.

2349
02:46:52,146 --> 02:46:52,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real.

2350
02:46:53,307 --> 02:46:54,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywhere, probably.

2351
02:46:54,387 --> 02:46:56,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I want to know what it's called, so I can get it.

2352
02:46:57,388 --> 02:46:59,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is like one of the anniversary editions.

2353
02:46:59,409 --> 02:47:02,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember the name, but I know I've seen one, and I know I've played one.

2354
02:47:02,990 --> 02:47:06,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll have to do some Google Foo on that, because I was thinking of that game earlier.

2355
02:47:08,644 --> 02:47:12,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, it was a nice trip down nostalgia lane, Jason.

2356
02:47:12,026 --> 02:47:12,286
[SPEAKER_04]: It was.

2357
02:47:12,766 --> 02:47:14,267
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a great 20 minutes.

2358
02:47:14,467 --> 02:47:15,728
[SPEAKER_11]: A good way to kill my drive.

2359
02:47:15,848 --> 02:47:16,648
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

2360
02:47:17,289 --> 02:47:18,630
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I appreciate about this show.

2361
02:47:18,670 --> 02:47:20,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great way to kill a long commuter drive.

2362
02:47:21,191 --> 02:47:23,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get to see you in a couple weeks, yes?

2363
02:47:25,753 --> 02:47:28,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps not in Sacramento, I don't think.

2364
02:47:29,075 --> 02:47:32,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprisingly busy considering how long I'm going to be out in the Bay Area.

2365
02:47:32,057 --> 02:47:35,819
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, I am definitely there for the upcoming con at the start of next month.

2366
02:47:36,027 --> 02:47:53,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know you'll be, even if you're not going to GamerX, you'll be in the area, and I'll be able to meet up with you there, which gives me another opportunity to promote the little panel deal-y going on Saturday at GamerX in San Francisco, August 3rd, I think it is the date.

2367
02:47:53,838 --> 02:47:54,559
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that Saturday.

2368
02:47:55,279 --> 02:48:04,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am doing a panel with my buddies from Koopa Club and Game Bar and Game Buoy.

2369
02:48:04,945 --> 02:48:06,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I'm leaving somebody else out.

2370
02:48:06,565 --> 02:48:07,786
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize in advance.

2371
02:48:07,866 --> 02:48:12,229
[SPEAKER_04]: But all us guys are getting together doing a podcast cross zone panel.

2372
02:48:12,969 --> 02:48:15,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just going to be talking about podcasting.

2373
02:48:16,331 --> 02:48:20,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Our show is kind of how we got into it and trying to enable more people to get their voices heard.

2374
02:48:20,774 --> 02:48:21,254
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be fun.

2375
02:48:23,082 --> 02:48:23,883
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a gay old time.

2376
02:48:23,903 --> 02:48:24,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a good time.

2377
02:48:24,984 --> 02:48:25,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Gay meaning happy.

2378
02:48:26,204 --> 02:48:31,188
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to take me to that place in Castro you were talking about earlier too.

2379
02:48:31,308 --> 02:48:31,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Which place?

2380
02:48:31,688 --> 02:48:32,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Cookie?

2381
02:48:33,829 --> 02:48:35,170
[SPEAKER_11]: No, the bar.

2382
02:48:36,551 --> 02:48:37,792
[SPEAKER_11]: The pinball bar.

2383
02:48:38,272 --> 02:48:43,016
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally going to become that song that's you, I'm going to take you to a gay bar.

2384
02:48:45,945 --> 02:48:47,226
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'm choking so have a good night guys.

2385
02:48:47,366 --> 02:48:48,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye Jason.

2386
02:48:48,106 --> 02:48:50,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for mentioning hot cookie because now I want to go there.

2387
02:48:51,088 --> 02:48:51,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2388
02:48:52,169 --> 02:48:53,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another call on the line.

2389
02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:54,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2390
02:48:54,571 --> 02:48:54,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2391
02:48:56,452 --> 02:48:57,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Azurame.

2392
02:48:58,313 --> 02:48:58,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Azurame.

2393
02:48:58,993 --> 02:48:59,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?

2394
02:49:01,155 --> 02:49:13,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just talking to one of my friends about the show and he actually came up and brought up the whole looking for a new show and we kind of do a show but it's kind of based off of like

2395
02:49:14,096 --> 02:49:14,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, pimp your show.

2396
02:49:14,957 --> 02:49:16,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about supporting indie shows.

2397
02:49:16,337 --> 02:49:18,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us where we can find it.

2398
02:49:40,006 --> 02:49:44,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, the name of the actual show is like Learning Japanese Through Music.

2399
02:49:45,188 --> 02:49:54,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And we kind of, you can look on Facebook at facebook.com slash groups, Japanese Through Anime.

2400
02:49:54,692 --> 02:49:57,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can probably see the page there you can actually add.

2401
02:49:57,693 --> 02:50:00,974
[SPEAKER_05]: We have like Thursday nights, we have like a three hour show.

2402
02:50:02,518 --> 02:50:05,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anybody follows the new anime Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan.

2403
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:22,661
[SPEAKER_08]: That show is crazy.

2404
02:50:23,162 --> 02:50:27,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, we broke down the show and, like, not the show, I'm sorry.

2405
02:50:27,425 --> 02:50:33,810
[SPEAKER_05]: We broke down the song into, like, different parts and translated it, and then at the end of the show, we kind of, like, all sing, like, on Adobe Connect.

2406
02:50:34,711 --> 02:50:42,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we also have a meet-up that we also, some of the local people kind of speak, you know, we meet up in person and kind of sing at, like, karaoke bars, but...

2407
02:50:44,383 --> 02:50:48,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, but I love the idea that your show ends with karaoke.

2408
02:50:49,005 --> 02:50:53,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know a lot of shows that do that.

2409
02:50:53,908 --> 02:50:55,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we need to do that here at OLR.

2410
02:50:55,849 --> 02:51:01,772
[SPEAKER_04]: We end every night with a rousing rendition of So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, good night.

2411
02:51:04,534 --> 02:51:05,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Second the no.

2412
02:51:06,515 --> 02:51:06,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

2413
02:51:07,715 --> 02:51:09,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm branching out and doing my own show.

2414
02:51:09,957 --> 02:51:11,898
[SPEAKER_05]: The lag kind of throws people off.

2415
02:51:11,938 --> 02:51:12,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2416
02:51:12,659 --> 02:51:19,801
[SPEAKER_05]: It does give you a chance to learn a little bit more about the anime or the Japanese pop band that you're probably interested in.

2417
02:51:20,101 --> 02:51:21,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe a little few words of Japanese too.

2418
02:51:22,461 --> 02:51:25,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we do have a show about anime on the network called Anime Jam Session, which is a good time.

2419
02:51:25,962 --> 02:51:28,923
[SPEAKER_04]: But it sounds like you have a different approach to the way you do it.

2420
02:51:28,943 --> 02:51:29,783
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a lot of fun.

2421
02:51:29,883 --> 02:51:31,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I will have to check that out.

2422
02:51:32,423 --> 02:51:33,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds fun.

2423
02:51:33,964 --> 02:51:38,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot me an email, rob at vognetwork.com and we'll chat a little more.

2424
02:51:39,265 --> 02:51:39,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

2425
02:51:39,992 --> 02:51:41,274
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2426
02:51:55,092 --> 02:52:10,815
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I'm sitting there and I'm leveling I think I got to level 25 and I was doing the Totema dungeon this morning which is like I mean there's only one other dungeon in the beta after that and I just I I'm not gonna be able to have enough time to get to that but I yeah I've been playing the shit out of that beta it's a lot of fun

2427
02:52:12,717 --> 02:52:13,277
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

2428
02:52:13,417 --> 02:52:14,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

2429
02:52:14,678 --> 02:52:21,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if you guys had a little group on here that might be doing some sort of free company LOR.

2430
02:52:21,781 --> 02:52:23,221
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a link shell yet.

2431
02:52:23,722 --> 02:52:25,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually made one.

2432
02:52:26,103 --> 02:52:27,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Link shells are really just chat channels.

2433
02:52:28,443 --> 02:52:32,305
[SPEAKER_04]: The free companies are really the guilds a la WoW or whatever.

2434
02:52:32,865 --> 02:52:34,806
[SPEAKER_04]: There will absolutely be something like that.

2435
02:52:34,926 --> 02:52:37,127
[SPEAKER_04]: At least Horde House is going to lead one somewhere.

2436
02:52:38,308 --> 02:52:41,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I will have more information on that when we know the full server list.

2437
02:52:42,009 --> 02:52:47,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now we're on Behemoth, but that could change for Phase 4, but we're going to commit to something soonish here.

2438
02:52:47,735 --> 02:52:50,638
[SPEAKER_04]: We just want to figure out where our frenzies are going to be and try to pick the best server.

2439
02:52:51,616 --> 02:52:52,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool, cool, okay.

2440
02:52:52,657 --> 02:52:56,659
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I'll just continue to just chime in on the network and find out more.

2441
02:52:56,799 --> 02:53:00,101
[SPEAKER_04]: We will whore the shit out of it here on OLR once the game's out.

2442
02:53:00,882 --> 02:53:01,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2443
02:53:01,482 --> 02:53:01,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2444
02:53:01,662 --> 02:53:02,183
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.

2445
02:53:02,403 --> 02:53:02,683
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2446
02:53:02,983 --> 02:53:03,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you take care, buddy.

2447
02:53:03,724 --> 02:53:04,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck with your show.

2448
02:53:04,604 --> 02:53:05,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Adobe Connect.

2449
02:53:05,665 --> 02:53:14,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not heard... You know, Adobe Connect, I know because during my day job, I'm a corporate trainer, so I've used Adobe Connect in meetings of that sort, but I've never heard of doing...

2450
02:53:15,271 --> 02:53:44,715
[SPEAKER_05]: a podcast through Adobe Connect but I'm thinking about it going well it makes sense it would work why not right it's kind of it's very similar to Google Hangout in many ways so yeah besides the payments I mean unfortunately it's kind of expensive like $80 a month and you get a chance to utilize like some of the tools like talking through a chat menu controlling the desktop and even like passing the microphone or the camera to someone else in the chat you know it's just it's a little bit more interactive I think that maybe uh

2451
02:53:46,112 --> 02:53:48,494
[SPEAKER_05]: If we moved to something like this, we'd probably be dying.

2452
02:53:49,775 --> 02:53:50,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

2453
02:53:50,696 --> 02:53:51,196
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, buddy.

2454
02:53:51,216 --> 02:53:52,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for the call.

2455
02:53:52,337 --> 02:53:53,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck with your show.

2456
02:53:53,198 --> 02:53:55,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk to you again here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2457
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:55,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

2458
02:53:56,180 --> 02:53:57,942
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, later.

2459
02:53:57,962 --> 02:54:01,524
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2460
02:54:01,644 --> 02:54:02,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got a tweet.

2461
02:54:03,206 --> 02:54:05,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the interactiveness of the show.

2462
02:54:05,648 --> 02:54:06,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got a tweet from...

2463
02:54:07,489 --> 02:54:17,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming Nerd who goes by GNVersion2 on Twitter that says Namco Classic Collection Volume 2 is a collection featuring Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Rally-X.

2464
02:54:17,591 --> 02:54:19,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was, yes, the other game.

2465
02:54:19,452 --> 02:54:21,972
[SPEAKER_04]: In both original and arrangement versions.

2466
02:54:22,012 --> 02:54:24,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'm Googling this right now to see if it's what I remember.

2467
02:54:24,733 --> 02:54:27,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody help me fill time while I ask for more calls.

2468
02:54:27,213 --> 02:54:28,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably have that at home, you know.

2469
02:54:29,034 --> 02:54:30,134
[SPEAKER_08]: That Namco Collection.

2470
02:54:33,114 --> 02:54:35,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean the ones that they released at home, but...

2471
02:54:36,535 --> 02:54:40,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I do remember that one because that was it.

2472
02:54:40,197 --> 02:54:41,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is it.

2473
02:54:41,578 --> 02:54:43,119
[SPEAKER_04]: This is totally what I was thinking of.

2474
02:54:43,539 --> 02:54:44,319
[SPEAKER_04]: You win a cookie.

2475
02:54:45,580 --> 02:54:49,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to... I'm going to shove a cookie through Twitter and I hope it made it in one piece.

2476
02:54:49,562 --> 02:54:50,582
[SPEAKER_04]: That is exactly the game I was thinking of.

2477
02:54:50,622 --> 02:54:52,543
[SPEAKER_08]: That person probably already has lots of cookies on their computer.

2478
02:54:53,304 --> 02:54:53,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

2479
02:54:55,085 --> 02:54:56,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that is exactly the game I was thinking of.

2480
02:54:56,646 --> 02:54:57,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at these screenshots.

2481
02:54:57,786 --> 02:55:01,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this whole little one with Pac-Man in the temple and with the little jumps.

2482
02:55:01,728 --> 02:55:01,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

2483
02:55:03,129 --> 02:55:04,189
[SPEAKER_04]: You, sir, are a win.

2484
02:55:04,229 --> 02:55:04,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2485
02:55:05,650 --> 02:55:08,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And next, hook me up with a link for a ROM.

2486
02:55:10,355 --> 02:55:10,635
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2487
02:55:12,176 --> 02:55:14,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Love the interactiveness here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2488
02:55:14,338 --> 02:55:15,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the tweets.

2489
02:55:15,539 --> 02:55:17,481
[SPEAKER_04]: That was on my personal Twitter, but you know what?

2490
02:55:18,562 --> 02:55:21,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I'm going to bring up personal stuff on the show because I had to know what game that was.

2491
02:55:22,545 --> 02:55:27,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to tweets that went to the OLR account and then Loki, I'll go over to you for some more last minute stories.

2492
02:55:27,609 --> 02:55:32,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio if you want to get in on the show.

2493
02:55:32,874 --> 02:55:38,718
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt sent us a tweet that says there's a Kickstarter to help open the largest pinball museum in Southern California too.

2494
02:55:39,078 --> 02:55:41,701
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I got a text message on this.

2495
02:55:41,741 --> 02:55:45,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Melody sent me a text on this and I think...

2496
02:55:46,348 --> 02:55:46,988
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2497
02:56:10,965 --> 02:56:20,332
[SPEAKER_08]: in fact I've been to the one in Las Vegas before they moved to their newer location and the one in Las Vegas has a pinball circus and all kinds of machines you just don't see anywhere

2498
02:56:25,009 --> 02:56:30,733
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma sent us a link about Xbox One gets booed out of Evo while demoing Killer Instinct.

2499
02:56:31,614 --> 02:56:31,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch.

2500
02:56:32,975 --> 02:56:34,036
[SPEAKER_04]: This doesn't sound good.

2501
02:56:34,076 --> 02:56:35,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to bring up the story right now.

2502
02:56:36,178 --> 02:56:39,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the booing is just sensationalism or what.

2503
02:56:39,801 --> 02:56:40,762
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's see.

2504
02:56:40,822 --> 02:56:41,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently...

2505
02:56:43,362 --> 02:56:43,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking ads.

2506
02:56:44,163 --> 02:56:45,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having a hard time bringing this up on my phone.

2507
02:56:47,606 --> 02:56:48,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2508
02:56:48,206 --> 02:56:56,913
[SPEAKER_04]: The Double Helix and Mad Catz guys were at Evo to pimp fight stick accessories and Killer Instinct, which of course was originally shown at E3.

2509
02:56:56,933 --> 02:56:56,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

2510
02:57:01,661 --> 02:57:07,584
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of hostility, I guess, shown at the event, even though the gameplay for Killer Instinct looked pretty good, and there's a video on there.

2511
02:57:09,205 --> 02:57:21,010
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it says the crowd was moderately accepting of Killer Instinct, but the fact that they were booing the Xbox One at such a core event like Evo 2013 speaks volumes about what gamers actually feel about the console.

2512
02:57:21,871 --> 02:57:22,951
[SPEAKER_04]: These weren't casuals.

2513
02:57:23,011 --> 02:57:25,753
[SPEAKER_04]: These weren't grandpas and grandmas buying consoles for little Timmy.

2514
02:57:26,033 --> 02:57:27,133
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the big Timmy's.

2515
02:57:27,654 --> 02:57:27,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

2516
02:57:28,254 --> 02:57:30,275
[SPEAKER_04]: This story from cinemablend.com.

2517
02:57:30,735 --> 02:57:33,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just sounds like a few angry mobsters.

2518
02:57:34,197 --> 02:57:37,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how much... I don't know.

2519
02:57:38,980 --> 02:57:44,763
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like there were just a few angry gaming nerds there and they unfortunately got picked up by the media.

2520
02:57:46,252 --> 02:57:47,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I heard about this.

2521
02:57:47,253 --> 02:57:49,276
[SPEAKER_04]: SJ100Matt is also sending us this tweet.

2522
02:57:49,756 --> 02:57:52,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Even I'm excited about this, and this says a lot.

2523
02:57:52,760 --> 02:58:00,469
[SPEAKER_04]: NHL 14, you know, hockey, is going to have an NHL 94 mode, which is like one of the best games ever, right?

2524
02:58:00,750 --> 02:58:03,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Complete with original sound effects, controls, and visuals.

2525
02:58:05,154 --> 02:58:05,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's sad?

2526
02:58:06,015 --> 02:58:08,656
[SPEAKER_04]: That's totally going to sell tons of copies in that game.

2527
02:58:08,996 --> 02:58:11,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Because NHL 94 is one of the best sports games ever.

2528
02:58:12,018 --> 02:58:16,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, before I give you all those concessions, I'm going to say this.

2529
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:19,021
[SPEAKER_04]: NHL 94 is no Blades of Steel.

2530
02:58:20,322 --> 02:58:21,122
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still pretty cool.

2531
02:58:22,563 --> 02:58:24,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people disagree with me there.

2532
02:58:24,964 --> 02:58:29,586
[SPEAKER_04]: AJ Twist wanted to alert us to the Ultra Street Fighter 4 game as well.

2533
02:58:30,627 --> 02:58:30,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

2534
02:58:32,936 --> 02:58:40,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft is tweeting us about Main6 who created Fighting is Magic is posting progress on their new game.

2535
02:58:40,699 --> 02:58:45,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they have to do something where they took the license out of it and now it's like a different type of game?

2536
02:58:46,501 --> 02:58:48,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to scan through the update here real quick.

2537
02:58:51,103 --> 02:58:53,404
[SPEAKER_04]: What, did they just change the horses basically?

2538
02:58:53,424 --> 02:58:53,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2539
02:58:56,361 --> 02:58:57,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Magical Horse Fighting Game

2540
02:59:20,797 --> 02:59:24,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure if Actdeft had something else he wants me to mention on that, he'll yell it in chat real quick.

2541
02:59:25,003 --> 02:59:33,614
[SPEAKER_04]: But while I'm waiting for that, I will mention Tigerclaw's tweet here that says, Valve introduces Pipeline, a program for teens seeking careers in the game industry.

2542
02:59:34,275 --> 02:59:34,836
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

2543
02:59:37,329 --> 02:59:38,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to read more about this here.

2544
02:59:39,190 --> 02:59:39,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

2545
02:59:39,690 --> 02:59:40,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Valve, Pipeline.

2546
02:59:40,931 --> 02:59:41,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

2547
02:59:41,371 --> 02:59:41,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

2548
02:59:43,932 --> 02:59:53,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Pipeline is an experiment to see if we can take a group of high school students with minimal work experience and train them in the skills and methods necessary to be successful at a company like Valve.

2549
02:59:53,717 --> 03:00:00,780
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing there yet besides a video and an FAQ, but hopefully that's going to change in the near future, especially as we get into the new school year, right?

2550
03:00:00,800 --> 03:00:00,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2551
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:12,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we will teach them to make two highly critical games and then delay the third one forever, thus building infinite anticipation for said sequel.

2552
03:00:12,334 --> 03:00:14,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, these high schoolers will be working on Half-Life 3.

2553
03:00:17,024 --> 03:00:18,265
[SPEAKER_12]: The next Half-Life 3.

2554
03:00:18,485 --> 03:00:24,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma in chat helping to clear up some about the Fighting is Magic new game.

2555
03:00:25,031 --> 03:00:30,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Lauren Faust is creating new characters for the game on the Skullgirls engine that they got for free after the Kickstarter.

2556
03:00:31,396 --> 03:00:32,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I remember that.

2557
03:00:32,436 --> 03:00:32,957
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

2558
03:00:33,337 --> 03:00:41,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though they couldn't use those characters, the creator was going to make new characters, and then the folks behind Skullgirls were really into it.

2559
03:00:41,303 --> 03:00:45,527
[SPEAKER_04]: They're apparently bronies over there at Skullgirls, so...

2560
03:00:46,147 --> 03:00:46,747
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

2561
03:00:49,248 --> 03:00:52,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats to all you fans who are going to be in that game.

2562
03:00:52,088 --> 03:00:54,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you guys will be excited about that.

2563
03:00:54,609 --> 03:00:55,669
[SPEAKER_04]: One last call for calls.

2564
03:00:55,689 --> 03:00:59,510
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2565
03:01:00,310 --> 03:01:03,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check in with Loki one more time and see if there's any other last minute stories or what have you.

2566
03:01:03,671 --> 03:01:04,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nothing.

2567
03:01:04,631 --> 03:01:04,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing?

2568
03:01:04,992 --> 03:01:05,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it for tweets too.

2569
03:01:06,972 --> 03:01:07,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We running out of show?

2570
03:01:07,992 --> 03:01:09,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Must be time to stick a nail in it.

2571
03:01:09,853 --> 03:01:11,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I guess we're done.

2572
03:01:11,394 --> 03:01:12,954
[SPEAKER_04]: The skyline's not ringing.

2573
03:01:13,154 --> 03:01:14,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It's over!

2574
03:01:14,615 --> 03:01:16,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to those that didn't get through.

2575
03:01:16,575 --> 03:01:20,317
[SPEAKER_04]: But, well, I guess maybe I missed you when I was on another call.

2576
03:01:20,357 --> 03:01:20,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2577
03:01:20,997 --> 03:01:22,157
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can always email us.

2578
03:01:22,217 --> 03:01:24,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.

2579
03:01:24,198 --> 03:01:25,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Or Skype could just be working.

2580
03:01:25,878 --> 03:01:26,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's true.

2581
03:01:26,559 --> 03:01:26,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Skype.

2582
03:01:28,860 --> 03:01:35,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at Orangelongerator.com Jason in our chatroom is piping up saying, Pipeline isn't going to teach them to make games.

2583
03:01:35,986 --> 03:01:39,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to teach them to make hats, cards, and other trinkets.

2584
03:01:39,628 --> 03:01:43,752
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is becoming a more and more popular thing in high schools to take a more trade school approach.

2585
03:01:44,112 --> 03:01:49,696
[SPEAKER_04]: And I honestly, you know, from somebody who just, I've been open about this on the show before.

2586
03:01:50,237 --> 03:01:51,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't finish college.

2587
03:01:52,359 --> 03:01:56,482
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why is because the industry I was studying at the time was radio and television.

2588
03:01:57,043 --> 03:02:11,435
[SPEAKER_04]: After interning at a TV station and doing all this stuff in the past, I just felt like I wasn't really going to be happy doing that stuff.

2589
03:02:13,097 --> 03:02:17,441
[SPEAKER_04]: This show is kind of a byproduct of what I did get out of college, which I'm very thankful for.

2590
03:02:18,541 --> 03:02:21,842
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, I went into the working world and just worked my way up.

2591
03:02:21,922 --> 03:02:27,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think being able to expose high schoolers to those really entry-level job skills, I think is a great thing for some people.

2592
03:02:27,864 --> 03:02:29,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not knocking college.

2593
03:02:29,085 --> 03:02:31,105
[SPEAKER_04]: College is a great thing for some people.

2594
03:02:31,506 --> 03:02:32,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't for me.

2595
03:02:32,726 --> 03:02:39,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly wish that for a lot of fields, especially the one that I'm in, that it didn't go so much from paying the $50,000 for college

2596
03:02:42,029 --> 03:02:46,452
[SPEAKER_08]: and went more into, you know, an apprenticeship type environment.

2597
03:02:46,952 --> 03:02:52,375
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, not an unpaid internship because to me that just seems like some form of required slavery.

2598
03:02:53,255 --> 03:02:58,678
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I think that it should work on, I mean, yeah, you need to go to college.

2599
03:02:58,818 --> 03:03:03,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Like for me, yeah, going to take art history, going to take anatomy, going to take things are all helpful.

2600
03:03:04,521 --> 03:03:10,206
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think when it comes to actually the industry type of job, it should be one-on-one working with somebody.

2601
03:03:10,966 --> 03:03:17,211
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, some type of, you know, you work as an apprentice, you become a journeyman, you know, like back in the day.

2602
03:03:18,973 --> 03:03:22,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so I don't want people to misunderstand what we're trying to like say here.

2603
03:03:22,816 --> 03:03:23,977
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR is anti-college.

2604
03:03:23,997 --> 03:03:24,717
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not it.

2605
03:03:24,778 --> 03:03:25,318
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know.

2606
03:03:25,538 --> 03:03:26,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having fun at college.

2607
03:03:26,819 --> 03:03:27,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2608
03:03:27,159 --> 03:03:28,521
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not going to a four-year yet.

2609
03:03:29,982 --> 03:03:31,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's many different ways to learn.

2610
03:03:33,684 --> 03:03:37,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that about does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2611
03:03:37,665 --> 03:03:43,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to thank you guys for tuning in tonight and supporting the show and supporting independent podcasting.

2612
03:03:43,287 --> 03:03:46,987
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show.

2613
03:03:47,067 --> 03:03:49,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and help grow our family.

2614
03:03:49,988 --> 03:03:51,408
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it.

2615
03:03:51,909 --> 03:03:53,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Bradley, thank you very much for being here tonight.

2616
03:03:53,949 --> 03:03:56,710
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get to hear a whole lot from you tonight, but I hope you had fun here on the show.

2617
03:03:56,850 --> 03:03:57,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, it was good.

2618
03:03:57,850 --> 03:03:59,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And feel free to pop back in any time.

2619
03:03:59,770 --> 03:04:00,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a pleasure to have you on.

2620
03:04:01,491 --> 03:04:01,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, yep.

2621
03:04:02,151 --> 03:04:06,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time we'll play a game or something you can actually have a little bit more of a say in or something.

2622
03:04:06,873 --> 03:04:10,474
[SPEAKER_04]: But see you hopefully in less than six months.

2623
03:04:10,674 --> 03:04:11,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a stranger.

2624
03:04:11,955 --> 03:04:13,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Any final thoughts you want to get out for the listeners?

2625
03:04:16,436 --> 03:04:20,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, after this show I'm going to probably go see Pacific Rim because that looks pretty cool.

2626
03:04:21,158 --> 03:04:26,980
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a goddamn travesty that that fucking Adam Sandler movie outpaced Pacific Rim.

2627
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:27,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so angry.

2628
03:04:28,221 --> 03:04:29,841
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much wrong with America.

2629
03:04:30,642 --> 03:04:30,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

2630
03:04:31,983 --> 03:04:34,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, they did not cancel the apocalypse.

2631
03:04:35,264 --> 03:04:35,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

2632
03:04:36,544 --> 03:04:36,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Horrible.

2633
03:04:37,685 --> 03:04:38,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

2634
03:04:38,025 --> 03:04:40,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because there are a lot of dumb people.

2635
03:04:40,786 --> 03:04:42,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So, more people need to go see Pacific Rim.

2636
03:04:43,586 --> 03:04:46,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything you want to... You don't really have, like, a Twitter or anything.

2637
03:04:46,547 --> 03:04:48,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any websites you want to pimp or promote while you're here?

2638
03:04:48,908 --> 03:04:50,148
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really have any of that stuff, do you?

2639
03:04:50,168 --> 03:04:54,290
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing I really have that's game-related is, like, I have a backloggery thing.

2640
03:04:55,310 --> 03:04:55,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2641
03:04:55,530 --> 03:04:59,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really have loads of people on that other than someplace, but...

2642
03:05:00,936 --> 03:05:04,199
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a pretty cool place if you want to list your games, but it takes forever to put them in there.

2643
03:05:04,219 --> 03:05:06,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if they don't have any drop-down, you have to put it in yourself.

2644
03:05:07,161 --> 03:05:10,463
[SPEAKER_10]: It tells me to keep up with the million things I'm playing.

2645
03:05:10,824 --> 03:05:13,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I have like 400 plus, let me wear it.

2646
03:05:13,726 --> 03:05:14,126
[SPEAKER_10]: 400 plus?

2647
03:05:15,387 --> 03:05:16,248
[SPEAKER_10]: 483 unfinished games.

2648
03:05:17,008 --> 03:05:17,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

2649
03:05:17,769 --> 03:05:18,690
[SPEAKER_10]: And I bought more already.

2650
03:05:19,971 --> 03:05:24,774
[SPEAKER_10]: You can really see how far behind you and how much crap you have on Steam and everything.

2651
03:05:24,834 --> 03:05:27,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it make a competition out of who can catch up on their backlog more?

2652
03:05:28,617 --> 03:05:29,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it give you trading cards?

2653
03:05:29,978 --> 03:05:30,579
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

2654
03:05:30,699 --> 03:05:36,504
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have little icons that show up depending on what you've finished.

2655
03:05:37,966 --> 03:05:41,349
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm confused because I have played 10 plus games at once.

2656
03:05:43,951 --> 03:05:44,692
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like me.

2657
03:05:45,593 --> 03:05:47,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well thanks again for being here and we'll see you soon.

2658
03:05:48,595 --> 03:05:50,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll go to DarkSakura.

2659
03:05:50,377 --> 03:05:51,258
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought tonight?

2660
03:05:52,279 --> 03:05:55,582
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I wish I had ice cream.

2661
03:05:57,510 --> 03:06:01,833
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought tonight is, well, maybe we can give you a Greek yogurt bar.

2662
03:06:01,873 --> 03:06:02,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not ice cream.

2663
03:06:02,914 --> 03:06:03,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

2664
03:06:04,055 --> 03:06:04,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, though.

2665
03:06:04,595 --> 03:06:05,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Thought we'd offer.

2666
03:06:06,336 --> 03:06:13,802
[SPEAKER_04]: My other final thought is, Shane is trying to course me into doing a Let's Play tonight on one of the streaming sites, so be looking for that.

2667
03:06:14,122 --> 03:06:17,084
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants me to play a game called Slender Man, which is a scary game.

2668
03:06:17,104 --> 03:06:19,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play that.

2669
03:06:19,606 --> 03:06:20,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you laughing over there?

2670
03:06:20,827 --> 03:06:21,447
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be funny.

2671
03:06:21,927 --> 03:06:26,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently that's going to happen later on, but I do have to work tomorrow, so we can't go too late.

2672
03:06:26,533 --> 03:06:27,394
[SPEAKER_04]: But stay tuned.

2673
03:06:27,995 --> 03:06:30,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I get the show up, if I have some time, I'll maybe go to that.

2674
03:06:30,578 --> 03:06:31,819
[SPEAKER_12]: You should just play Surgeon Simulator.

2675
03:06:31,839 --> 03:06:33,501
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's just as funny.

2676
03:06:33,701 --> 03:06:33,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it?

2677
03:06:33,961 --> 03:06:39,007
[SPEAKER_12]: And everybody should buy Surgeon Simulator if you haven't yet, 2013, because it's just...

2678
03:06:39,588 --> 03:06:40,089
[SPEAKER_12]: and DarkSakura.

2679
03:06:54,847 --> 03:07:11,366
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura has her own channel and I want to be able to do things that don't necessarily have the OLR name attached to it just because you know I don't want to be OLRs for all of us so we'll have like maybe hopefully I'm hoping we can bring the webcam back streaming the shows in the future and so forth but there you go

2680
03:07:12,006 --> 03:07:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: uh Codeman says can you record it please uh I I'm gonna try I don't want to promise tonight I feel like I should do a test run of something else tonight and then do Slender Man but I am I am very interested in getting into the YouTube scene of Let's Play I'll leave it at that

2681
03:07:28,777 --> 03:07:33,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the program that you were using before and the one that I'm using still automatically records.

2682
03:07:33,921 --> 03:07:34,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.

2683
03:07:34,302 --> 03:07:38,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to make sure I don't have performance suffering because of it, but I should.

2684
03:07:38,305 --> 03:07:38,585
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.
