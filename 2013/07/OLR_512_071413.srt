Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this, episode 512, July the 14th of 2013.

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Always appreciate your support of indie podcasting. So let's talk about games. My name is Rob Roberts and we'll talk games tonight with DarkSakura.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Me. How are you? Me. Me? Oh, you're MII because you have your 3DS open right now. Yeah, I actually feel like I've been to the gym.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah? Because like I walked around all day yesterday, which I'm sure we'll get to, but like my butt hurts like I've been on the elliptical. That's hot.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Everyone knows the elliptical butt hurt, I'm hoping. And if not, then imagine walking uphill for a long time. And that's the elliptical butt hurt as well. I am literally butt hurt.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The show hasn't even started. Is your butt nice and firm DarkSakura? And speak slowly when you respond.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah. Also say hello to, and I don't know how firm his butt is, but let's say hi to tech master Loki. Hi. How are you doing?

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Doing fine. Probably not that firm when you get two cheeseburgers at McDonald's, but today you have Subway. You go in the Jared diet or what's up with this?

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No, no diet. I just got sick of eating cheeseburgers. It's fair. I've actually been trying to eat better. I've been doing like more salads at work. Like I don't like go out and get fast food.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How are you liking the candy bar? Shut up. I was going to get to that. I do have Friday as a cheat day and I was like, ah, I can't even like like chicken McNuggets don't even sound good. So I think that's a good thing. Right? Like when the really bad food starts to like so bad.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But then DarkSakura, this bitch shows up and brings candy bars to the show and not, they're not just any candy bars. They're crunch bars with girl scout cookie mix or something in them. Cause basically she brought me Samoas. Basically candy bar form.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But if you read the label, they are less bad for you than a serving of Samoas. Oh cool. The entire package is 190 calories. Cool. Can I have two? Yes, you can have two.

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Bitch, if you want to eat it, then sure. I will just do some butt firming. Just dance for after the show too. Oh my God. I had the worst Mongolian barbecue last night. Never go to Sue's Mongolian barbecue in Santa Clara.

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, okay. Girl, first mistake. You went to Mongolian barbecue in the Bay area. No. Yet to find a good place. No. Dance said that they had a really good place that they went to last year. Okay. And so we thought we were going there, but they went to a different place and it was nasty.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I mean they had some really good orange chicken that wasn't hot. It was more like sweet and sour orangey chicken and it was pretty good, but I got so sick and then I had to go drink to forget about it.

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It was so bad that I had to, I had to drink and then I played drunk 2DX, which was great.

23
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Look, I want to introduce a guest that doesn't drive us to drink out of anger, but we might have a drink with him because he's a good friend of the show and he's, he's been here on and off for really the past 12 years.

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hopefully you recognize this name, even though he hasn't been here in a while. Say hello. Welcome back. Bradley is here. Hello. How's it going? Arkadian42, if you rather. Yes. Is that still your screen name all these years later? Yes, it is. Awesome. Still going that way.

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Howdy. How you doing? I'm doing okay. What's new with you? Catch us up on the past year since you've been on the show. Well, it was about six months ago. Okay, six months ago. I haven't done too much different. I went to California Extreme and I saw Dan, but I didn't see Jamie at all.

26
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So I was actually hanging out in the Bamani Corner for quite a while and then I hung up playing Metallica for quite a while. Yeah, I played that one. Did you get to play it? Yeah, I played it a few times. Did you get to play Wizard of Oz? No, I saw it, but I didn't have time. Did you see like the horde around Wizard of Oz? I got to touch it.

27
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah, there was a fair number of people and I kind of looked at it and watched someone playing it right before I left. I have a video of the gameplay and I was planning on posting it tonight and reposting it to the Orange Lounge Tumblr.

28
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Alright, we got to back up a minute here because I wanted to talk about this at the start of the show anyway. You guys, both you guys, I didn't get to go, Logie didn't go. You guys are both at this thing that they do in the Bay Area every year called California Extreme, right? It was quite extreme.

29
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So what, for those that don't know, because they do have an international audience, what is California Extreme? California Extreme is basically a bunch of pinball tables and a bunch of classic arcade games and a couple of new ones here and there. Like I said, there was a 2DX and a couple of DDRs and a BeatMania 3.

30
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And also it's where a lot of pinball vendors, which the number is kind of dwindling now, but parts vendors will come. You know, people sell like, I almost bought a Bionic Woman lunchbox like from when I was an infant. I was so close. So anyway, it's just a big...

31
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And lunchbox.

32
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No, no I didn't. I ended up not. And people, there's documentaries they do there. They do panels. Like we went to this one that was called Galaxy Game where they were talking about the old space fight game and how they programmed it and how much a computer cost in 1971. $13,000.

33
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

34
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, it was expensive.

35
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It talks about having 8K of RAM and how wonderful it was.

36
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It was just a really neat event, you know, and I ran into like tons of people I know that I never see.

37
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So it's like a celebration of classic gaming with like a splash of modern gaming.

38
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah.

39
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's basically if Bobby Black Wolf Show were an expo, right?

40
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, it's also, you know, all these games are on free play on top of it. And it's, Stern comes out every year and brings like their top new tables. And so there was like an Avengers there. There was an X-Men. There was ACDC. There was the new Metallica table with all the three different types of back glass on it.

41
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And it was just really a lot of fun. And of course, man, I feel so bad because the guy who owns this Big Bang bar, actually no, he I think sold it to the convention finally, a Big Bang bar prototype, which was like one of Capcom's last tables they produced.

42
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's really beat. It's in rotten shape. It needs to be shopped. But the thing now is that you can get repro parts for it because they've actually there's a person reproducing the Big Bang bar table and kingpin. They had a kingpin there, too.

43
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And then there were like the Gottlieb tables that were all like Miami Heat instead of Miami Vice and Raven instead of Rambo. You know, all these little knockoff titles because they couldn't get licensing.

44
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And, you know, Data East tables that are always kind of between cheeseball and awesome. There's the Super Mario mushroom world there. You know, I love that one. Yeah. And it was broken when I tried to play it. And then all these other people who are taller than me were trying to play like, dude, I'm actually the right size.

45
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And then there was this game that had like it's like called Alley Cat or something that had trash cans and they lift up. It's a little kid's ball game. Oh, yeah. Melody and I were there, got on our knees and we're just throwing balls and balls and balls and balls at it.

46
00:07:47,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So you got on your knees and we're playing with balls and cats, balls and pussy. Okay. Just just make it sure we're all busy. All right. Good times. Bradley, were you on your knees playing with balls at some point? Oh, not really your thing.

47
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I didn't go on these, but I did play that little the Super Mario one, the small title. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Because like Mario had like a kid's table and an adult table. Right. Yeah. Because they were right next to each other. They did have one that was on adult size legs. Yeah. But it was just to display the LEDs.

48
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay. That might have been something different, but there was two next to the little one and the other one. I know because one of them does the I don't know the complete name of it, but it's one that I had like there was an arcade near my high school that had it.

49
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We're not an arcade. Actually, Ice Rink had it and I went there and played it every so often. Oh, it's a good fun one.

50
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Um, I was just gonna say about California extreme. It's not really just the games either. You because you run into a lot of people. Right. Which is what ticks me off. Why I couldn't go because you ran into like tons of people blast from the past from the DDR days. Right. Yeah.

51
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah. Like, uh, ran into, uh, Richard ran into, uh, sell Chris Tang, which you see Chris Tang at every event that has the money. Um, uh, ran into, uh, Ali, I ran into, um, Wendell, of course.

52
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And, uh, Chris from DDR freak back in the day, he actually arrived late at night. Like I'm in the middle of playing the song and then I end the song. Next thing I know, I'm like in this bear hug. It was awesome. That's cool.

53
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So it was kind of like a little mini con. Yeah, pretty much. And then it's a lot of, you know, because a lot of us who, you know, started off back in the day, we're all grown up. So we were going out, you know, drinking in the, cause there's like a little bar in the front of the Hyatt and you know, $15 lemon drop.

54
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So we're actually out there having our adult fruit, fruit drinks and talking about games. Is it more of an adult convention? Like I'm not talking, there was some kids there, but a lot of people, you know, there was, there was some teenagers, there were some little kids there, but a lot of people really were just older gamers.

55
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I bet a lot of those were like people bringing their kids too, or like they were bringing themselves and brought their kids. There were a few. Yeah. Like I actually met a guy from Folsom who has like a pretty sizable private collection and he brought his daughter.

56
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Nice. We actually ended up hanging out at a table just chatting about collections versus buying a house. Cause that's what Dan and I were trying to do. Did you get more listeners for VOG while you were there? I did pimp us out.

57
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, good. And there's some people I'm sorry, I've forgotten to put you, uh, uh, on my Facebook, but hi, it was great to meet you. And I met a friend of Kyle Snyder.

58
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What the hell has he been doing? I'm sorry. No idea, but I said I'd give him a shout out. So hi.

59
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I know like we have like more listeners now than we did back in the DDR day. And like none of you people know who Kyle Snyder was, but for those that do epic freestyle and he actually what didn't he debut a single here on this show like years ago.

60
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And I've always wondered what happened to that kid. I'm not even kidding. Like, Oh God, no, it was one of the best of the dark Tetsuya put together, had his premiere in it.

61
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And I was listening to like, yes, I was listening to my own show while I was driving to Disneyland cause I'm such a narcissist. Well, no, I, I, I wanted to hear the best of the dark Tetsuya put together.

62
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And I heard the Kyle Snyder segment and I was like, what happened to that kid? What happened? I mean, he's gotta be like 30 now, right? Maybe if I'm 35, that guy's gotta be 30 last I heard, you know, he went on his Mormon mission and that's, you know, that's a two year commitment.

63
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So people sometimes disappear after that. So amazing. I just thought it was, you know, pretty, uh, pretty interesting, you know, running into people who knew people that I knew and, you know, especially, and I spent all day on my, uh, my, uh, DS checking where I tagged people from and running into people who screen names.

64
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I recognize and like going, I want to send them a message, find me shit, you know, but yeah, you should be able to like add friends from that or at least, or at least like send a message.

65
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You know, I wanted to, I actually did tag him twice and I could have sent him a message, but it was toward the end of the night and he wouldn't have gotten my message. So whatever you're having fun with your three DS. This is only the second week you've had it.

66
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I swear everybody. Oh yeah, I have, I'm already, I've already got, let's see, I've expanded my house. I bought my house, expanded it twice, bought my upstairs, expanded it once and I have my basement now. I'm paying for my dream suites. I'm getting club lol and Blathers wants to expand my, uh, my museum.

67
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're, you're on it and animal crossing. Fuck yeah. Awesome. It's cause I go to the island and pick fruit instead of doing the little, uh, games and then go sell my fruit and then I do it like five times in a day. That's how to do it. That's how to do it. I'm making money. It's 80 style.

68
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All right, let me go back to Bradley, our guest Bradley. You had fun at California stream. Were you there Friday and Saturday or just Saturday or no, just Saturday. There's a Saturday Sunday convention. So why don't I think it was three days? I thought it was just to gotcha.

69
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Um, what, what, what kinds of games you've been playing the past year or six months you beaten anything lately or, uh, rogue, rogue Alexi was the last thing I beat. That was a pretty cool game. Bobby was just talking about that on his show.

70
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's the one where like it's the Metroid Castlevania game where you play descendants of the hero. Yeah. So basically you go through the castle and you're collecting, basically you're collecting money as you go through it and then trying to beat the bosses and stuff.

71
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And, uh, as you get more money and once you, you die after a while, cause it's, the enemies are kind of hard and it's easy to, to all the spikes and all that kind of stuff. So once you die, you basically build up your castle.

72
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Basically, uh, as you upgrade, you get different options and, uh, you get new options for what children can be and like runes and things like that to basically expand your gameplay and help you along, get you more HP, more MP and, and other, other options like that.

73
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And then then you keep trying over and over again for hundreds of times. Um, yeah, I saw this game on steam and I wanted to get it, but it is not part of the, and we'll obviously have to talk about this.

74
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The steam sale going on right now, which has many people's attentions, but it's still worth it outside the, the lack of sale price, right?

75
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah. Actually I did see it on sale for like $2 off or something like that. Not, not too big of a deal, but.

76
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well that's something.

77
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah. So I bought it at $15 and that's well worth the price.

78
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's no like Tomb Raider for 12 bucks or Borderlands 2 for 10, but that's, that's still a pretty good deal.

79
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah. And you can play this for hours and hours. Some people can beat it pretty fast. That took me like 22 hours just cause I took a lot of time exploring the castle each time and didn't try to kill the bosses really early.

80
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So, and then there's new fame plus and you can just keep going and going as much as you want.

81
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Nice. That sounds like a fun time.

82
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Another big game was playing Animal Crossing. I've been playing that shit loads. Basically I'm already up to 85 hours in the game. Like man, it just takes so much time. There's so many different things to do. Like it takes like two hours a day to, to when you're starting out.

83
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's all?

84
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah. Well, I've spent more than that. Like on the Island days, if you go to Island.

85
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I fell off the wagon y'all. I stopped playing Animal Crossing. I just couldn't take that investment anymore. I'm just like, it's too much. I have to do it every day.

86
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And part of it too is that it's a slow process. Like if I could just open up my 3DS and be in my town, yay, I'd be there. But it's like, you got to open it up, load the game, wait for the game, wait for the thing to load your town.

87
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Then you got to make sure you save and quit. Are you going to get Mr. Aceti? It's just kind of like, it takes too fucking long to get in there.

88
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
True.

89
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, I don't think so.

90
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I do.

91
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah. But it is a lot of time investment to do a bunch of things. Yeah. And basically the, the message boards I go at, we're basically have loads of front people that are messing each other and getting, swapping items and all that stuff.

92
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay.

93
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So basically I've gotten a lot of stuff.

94
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, nice.

95
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Almost done with the house.

96
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, you will get my small pitiful house in your, in Plaza now since we, I see the green light on my 3DS. So there you go.

97
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And other games, FTL was a big game that I played a lot of, and I played that this week, uh, to, for the trading card thing.

98
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And you got sucked into that trading card thing too?

99
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't know. I don't know about the trading yet, actually doing the trading cause that seems like a ton of annoyingness, but I did play that and a bit of Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy, and haven't played too many other games that were in that thing that this trading card so far.

100
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, they're adding new ones every day.

101
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah. Cause I probably go play, I want to pay Portal and Portal 2 again to, cause I haven't played them on Steam yet, so I could see them in other than 720p and watch them in 1080 or however good they are on, for the Steam version.

102
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So I might do that pretty soon.

103
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Awesome.

104
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And another big thing right now is those new, the new Meat Plaza games. Basically they just released those last week, and you can basically get the bundle for 15 bucks of all four of them.

105
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And basically, I think at the right, at the beginning, near the beginning of, of, of Extreme, the California Extreme yesterday, I almost spent an hour standing off right near the entrance doing the updates for those, or doing the, doing those games.

106
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Doing, cause basically you can, for each new game you can take all the 10 tags that you have and take them through each game. So that takes a lot.

107
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah, that's not for convention play. You know what I mean? Like that's just too many people. Like, but that's, for, for when you occasionally street pass on people, I think that's a good, good thing to do.

108
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
They need to let you hold more than 10 people in the buffer though.

109
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That would be nice.

110
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That would be nice. For conventions.

111
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah, that was annoying cause then I think I'd be done and then like, nope, more people.

112
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Imagine when I was at E3.

113
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh yeah. I'm just waiting until my next Disneyland trip.

114
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Disneyland's not as bad. I mean, you will fill it up partway through the day. So you want to check a couple of times a day and it's going to be harder with these four new games because now it's like, now I got to play this, the fantasy zone game.

115
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Now I got to play the kingdom game and whatever. It's, it's a lot. So I think, I think I kind of have to pick my battles and which, which game do I really want to progress on the most? And for me, that's the puzzle trading to get the little 3d pictures.

116
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I did finish two puzzles.

117
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Did you? Congrats.

118
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Good.

119
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah. They just opened up two new ones right when I was like, I was within like 40 pieces of having everything and now two new puzzles.

120
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Just these four new puzzles.

121
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Bastard. Really?

122
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes.

123
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh my God.

124
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Jerks.

125
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
All right. Fair enough.

126
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Um, well, I guess I've been blurring the line here a little bit between trying to interview Bradley and getting to our gaming weeks, but one thing I wanted to bring up was steam sale.

127
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sure you guys listening to this show can't avoid it.

128
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What is it about the steam sale that gets everybody in the gaming community talking?

129
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I guess it's probably them prices, right?

130
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The fact that, uh, you know, what is it today right now?

131
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Tomb Raider as of the taping of the show, 12 bucks.

132
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Actually, that was yesterday's deal, but they, they last for 48 hours, right?

133
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Uh, borderlands two for $10 and the season pass another $10 a really cheap stuff.

134
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And then of course, valve trying to sweeten the pot a little bit by this whole new thing with the trading cards.

135
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And now they've incorporated that into the sale where you get trading cards for voting, which Ooh, it's after six o'clock.

136
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I got to go vote on what game is next. Get my, I'll do my later.

137
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But, uh, yeah, they get the cards through that or by spending money or by crafting badges.

138
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Thank you, Loki. He gave me the two cards I was missing in the super meat boy set.

139
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And I crafted my first badge before the show.

140
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And I got, uh, I got a summer sale card for crafting it now.

141
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And I got my little emoticon that's deal with it with the super meat boy shades.

142
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And I got the doctor fetus background with the big middle finger for my profile.

143
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So that's kind of awesome. So if you visit my profile, well, I haven't changed it yet, but I will, but, uh, I will be flipping you off on my steam profile.

144
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But I wanted to say, if you are getting into the trading card whoring thing for no explainable reason, like myself, uh, visit vognetwork.com and check out the forums.

145
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I have posted an official steam trading card for him there because not only did I trade with Loki, I think I traded with Rababa the other day.

146
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You know, I'm starting to trade with other people, but I would like to help out vog listeners.

147
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll go to the general steam trade community if I must, but I'd rather help the vog people get the cards they need first.

148
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So I only have a couple extras right now, but if I have something you want, let's talk.

149
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Uh, cause now what do I need? I'm two cards short on really big skies.

150
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So if you have, if you have the cards for that, help me out.

151
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Uh, Alan Alchemy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says the trading cards are neat, but I'm annoyed at their integration into the sale.

152
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
They already had a great meta game for sales that worked and did more to enrich and create content for the community in my opinion.

153
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Like write, write a recommendation for a game you own, post screenshots and so on.

154
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Um, yeah, you know, steam did kind of generalize that into a community badge.

155
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So it's there, but yeah, I liked, I did like how you'd kind of get the perks every few months when they did these big sales, the summer sale and the winter sale.

156
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Like I, I do kind of miss that a little bit because the kind of homogenizing it all into just the general community badge is going to make the sales lose that little special end of it.

157
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But the trading cards is something, but I draw the line at spending real money.

158
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I won't, I won't, I promise I won't, but I will probably end up with Borderlands 2 cause Bobby got Borderlands 2.

159
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'll play.

160
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And you've got Borderlands 2.

161
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I do and I haven't played it yet.

162
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Loki has Borderlands 2. That's four people to all play some co-op on live streaming. What do you think? What do you think Dark Soccer? What do you think?

163
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Alright, I get the thumbs up in the other room.

164
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Alright, let's get into our other gaming weeks and the other types of games that you've been playing this week.

165
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I do not leave trash all over your table, hello.

166
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, I appreciate that.

167
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I was throwing it away like a responsible adult.

168
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You gotta do something responsible.

169
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You could have just put it in the bowl with this trash cause I gotta go throw that out anyway.

170
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You know what? My trash is separate.

171
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You have to separate our trash? I understand.

172
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't want my trash to get gay.

173
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm kidding. Shame on you.

174
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Alright.

175
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I will throw away your trash.

176
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh, you don't have to do that.

177
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm up.

178
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Aw, shucks. Thanks.

179
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Well then, since Dark Soccer's walking away, let me check in with Bradley.

180
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I know you kinda already gave us the rundown on what you've been playing lately, but is there any other games you wanna talk about during your gaming week?

181
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh, let's see. I don't know if there was anything else that I didn't mention.

182
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay. That's alright. I figured you probably got out what you were currently playing in there.

183
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Well, Jamie's back, so let me ask Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

184
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Fuck. Busy.

185
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I played a lot of BeatMania 2DX. I got to try a lot of new songs, some of which I passed the first time through.

186
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I was playing on standard, so, you know, easy mode.

187
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I passed Star Mine.

188
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Ain't no shame in that. You're in your mid-thirties now. You get to tone it down a bit.

189
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I haven't touched it since we last had one, and what did we have last? A red?

190
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It actually had the DJ Troopers banner on it, but it was a trichoro.

191
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I got to play a lot of fun stuff. I played some BeatMania 3.

192
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Going from 2DX to BeatMania 3, the timing is just freakin' bizarre, you know?

193
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So anyway, I played Quartet, which I was super disappointed that I couldn't hear the music.

194
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Our fortune cookie reflects the music because I wanna freakin' hear that song.

195
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I also played... I didn't play Journey because there was someone on it every time.

196
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I played a lot of Metallica Pinball. It's super good.

197
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's funny with me and three other people behind me singing Master of Puppets while I'm playing the game.

198
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Because I can't help it, you know?

199
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Master of Puppets is just one of those songs that you have to sing along with certain parts of it if you know the song.

200
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And I love old Metallica.

201
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Also, one of our friends that drove us down there, he has a limited edition Metallica.

202
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
He buys everything that Stern puts out new.

203
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And he got it signed by... I think the artist's name was Dirty Donny, I think.

204
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
He just ran into him and got him to sign it. So that was cool.

205
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I know I played a bunch of other stuff.

206
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I did play some Little Inferno as far as not classic stuff.

207
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I pretty much played a ton of different games.

208
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I played Timber with Melody. That was fun.

209
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And then we threw our balls at some pussies. And it was pretty fun too.

210
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I also played ACDC Pinball. I played Big Bang Bar.

211
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I played The Wizard of Oz Pinball.

212
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I got some footage of it that I'm going to be putting on my Tumblr and reposting to the Orange Lounge Tumblr later tonight.

213
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Including the rainbow mode. Rob, it's so cool.

214
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's like they've got multicolored LEDs in the play field.

215
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So that they'll cycle through different colors over each area instead of just having the standard incandescence of the older tables.

216
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's pretty neat.

217
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So yeah, I won't go too much into the classic stuff because, like I said, there's a bunch of it there and I played a bunch of it.

218
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I played a lot of Animal Crossing, like I said.

219
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Little Inferno, I finally put down the two bucks to get Little Inferno on Steam.

220
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's freaking fun.

221
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And the art style is like Edward Gorey and Joan M. Vasquez and Tim Burton all got put into a blender and their art style came out into this.

222
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It was pretty neat.

223
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And it's kind of just a creepy game, but basically what happens in that game is that you get a fireplace.

224
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And you just burn stuff. And you can earn money the more that you burn things and buy different things out of catalogs.

225
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And as you get different combos of stuff, you unlock more catalog and you have to use up your catalog before you can get a new catalog.

226
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And you have to make 99 different combos of stuff.

227
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And some of them are kind of hard because for one that's one of the last ones in there, you have to combine the sun and Pluto and the moon.

228
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And it's called the solar system combo.

229
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But when you put Pluto in there, it freezes everything. But when you put the sun in there, it burns everything.

230
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And it lasts for a long time, so you actually have to wait until your fireplace is completely empty.

231
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Put in Pluto and then put in the sun and then the moon. And then it'll do everything.

232
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You get like ice cubes. There's one that's called the well-medicated combo that's like wine and happy pills and stuff.

233
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That one's pretty funny. And the wine is called the midlife crisis mitigator.

234
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What game is this still? Little Inferno?

235
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Little Inferno. And then when you get past that, and to anyone who hasn't played it before that's going to,

236
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
remember what items that you send to your neighbor.

237
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Because those are the items for the final combo.

238
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Which I had to go back and look them all up again because I forgot what I sent.

239
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
After that, though, you have like a little adventure part of the game. You know, kind of a point-and-clicky sort of thing.

240
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And I just started that, so I'm going to probably be playing more of that one tomorrow.

241
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I actually have not played any Mass Effect for an entire week.

242
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh my god! What is the date? July 14th, episode 512. The one where she didn't play Mass Effect all week long. Holy shit.

243
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Rob, in my defense, I've been looking for houses and I didn't play live on Thursday because of the stupid cough.

244
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So you know what? I'm allowed to take a vacation.

245
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I just, Commander Shepard is shedding a single tear.

246
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Sometimes people in relationships need to take some time off from each other.

247
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Allowed to take a vacation. That is something a pod person would say.

248
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Anyway, I did buy a few more games on Steam, but I forgot what they were because I'm probably going to buy more tonight.

249
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But I was going to get FTL, but it just doesn't seem like my kind of game.

250
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Oh, I did get Hotline Miami and the Download Pack.

251
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I haven't tried it yet, but it just looks like it's so much fun because I like going around in a virtual environment.

252
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
A safe virtual environment where there's no risk that I'm actually going to do anything like this in real life and kill a bunch of people.

253
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And big bloody massacres with a neat soundtrack.

254
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's not like I'm going to plug in my iPhone and listen to some dead mouse and shoot up a mall. Not going to happen.

255
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Not going to happen.

256
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Only in game.

257
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Only in a game.

258
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

259
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I didn't really play a whole ton of this stuff because I was doing all sorts of weird things.

260
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Like I was modding my laptop cooling tray because I was trying to play Super Meat Boy on Sunday and my laptop got really hot.

261
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
My laptops with dedicated graphics cards, they tend to get warm because graphics cards aren't meant to be shoved into a laptop.

262
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So I figured I needed a little bit more than just the really cheap blower fans that they had on there.

263
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So I crafted a thing using basically the parts I had from my PC and my laptop cooling tray.

264
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So after cutting some of the plastic around and stuff, I screwed in two 120mm fans in there that are from my Antec case.

265
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So they have the three speed settings.

266
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And of course you need a dedicated 12 volt power supply so I have a separate plug in the wall now.

267
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And I had to manufacture a super long molex cable to connect to it.

268
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So I have that now.

269
00:29:47,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It works okay except I need new fan grills on it because the ones I made out of some office mesh stuff, office supply trays and stuff, they kind of bend too much.

270
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And so occasionally if it's sitting weird in my lap you'll hear it scrape against the fan blades.

271
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But it keeps it cool, that's for sure.

272
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So let's see, aside from that I played Super Meat Boy. I actually played through quite a bit of it.

273
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And then I have been staring at a lot of the Steam sales stuff but so far I'm showing much restraint and not picking up Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition for $5.

274
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Because I know that a game like that, like Skyrim, is going to take hundreds of hours to sink in there.

275
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And it'll be a fun hundred hours or so but with Saints Row 4 around the corner and Grand Theft Auto 5 in a couple months I really have to plan my gaming because Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to encompass my entire life after Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out.

276
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So yeah, so I'm not picking that up yet.

277
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Although tomorrow that's another thing.

278
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That gameplay trailer which I haven't seen yet.

279
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So amazing.

280
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
How'd you feel about that?

281
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh it was great.

282
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah?

283
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It was fantastic.

284
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What'd you think of it?

285
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We talked about it on Hoard House this week.

286
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I guess there's a teaser at the end about a Grand Theft Auto Online?

287
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Well it's just what they're calling their online portion of the game.

288
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Because there's an online portion to Grand Theft Auto 4 but now they're calling it Grand Theft Auto Online.

289
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And it looks great.

290
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I mean it looks really good.

291
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Obviously the screenshots that they've been putting out aren't the same quality as the gameplay trailer.

292
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But that just leads to the rumors that yeah they're producing a higher quality asset version of the game so they can be ported to the PC or next gen consoles when the time comes.

293
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Just so y'all know, Loki told me before the show tonight, you will get Grand Theft Auto 5 and you will play it.

294
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Like it was not unique to us. You will.

295
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Well because you have Grand Theft Auto 4 and you still haven't played it.

296
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Alan played it on PC.

297
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That's Alan playing it. I'm not talking about Alan. I'm talking about you playing it.

298
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Honestly though, you probably should just skip 4 at this point and just go straight into 5 because it's going to be way better anyways.

299
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't know. Just everything looks great about it.

300
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Like the gameplay looks tighter. The combat looks better.

301
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
The level of detail in the game is just ridiculous.

302
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And it just looks fun. It looks like a game that I can sink hundreds of hours into.

303
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And let's not kid ourselves. You will.

304
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I will.

305
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That game will cause disagreements between you and the wife.

306
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
No, no it won't because I will.

307
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The only problem is going to be getting this scream to play that on.

308
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I guess I could play it in the other room but I can because my Xbox 360 has WiFi so that will be just fine.

309
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
There you go.

310
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I can play in the other room.

311
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Problem solved.

312
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Exactly.

313
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

314
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
No, not really. I'm just getting ready.

315
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I was installing Arma 2 and the expansion DayZ.

316
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Actually, because Gali had sent me a message on Twitter saying that he has a DayZ breakpoint server.

317
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So maybe we can do that in the future.

318
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
VOG game night. Although for now I'm just suspending VOG game night because it's hard to get everybody together.

319
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's just to think of games to play.

320
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's really difficult, especially since on Fridays, usually Josh is going to bed later.

321
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So I'm getting on at 9 and it's not a whole ton of time to play.

322
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Focus on building our online communities for now and then we can look into doing something like that again.

323
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The good thing though, there is one good gaming thing that did happen this week.

324
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,000
By some miracle, they fixed our Minecraft server long enough for me to download the backup of it.

325
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So I made a backup and downloaded the world. So we still have the world intact now.

326
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So my plan is when I do eventually get around to actually...

327
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Aww, that's just fantastic. Brad, you're awesome.

328
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So Brad from Pod Culture sent me a copy of Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition.

329
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Oh, shut up. Right now?

330
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah, it's awesome. Thank you.

331
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Brad, you are too good to us. That man sends us booze. He sends us games.

332
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Brad, you're the man. He's awesome.

333
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And he sends me episodes of Doctor Who.

334
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What else does a nerd need besides games, Doctor Who, and booze?

335
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Coffee!

336
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Coffee.

337
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Brad, you're right. Everybody listen to Pod Culture. 6 o'clock Pacific, Monday nights here at VOG.

338
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So anyways, the plan is what I'm going to do with it once I get around to actually setting up that Minecraft server with mods and stuff.

339
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm going to do a multi-world server where you can travel between the server that Gali has set up right now, which I think is a survival server.

340
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So I'm just going to leave that alone. And then ours, which is a creative server.

341
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So you'll be able to go back and forth between that stuff and I think it'll be the best of both worlds there.

342
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I don't want to ruin the mood, but don't download that while the show's going.

343
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
No, of course not. Come on, man.

344
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Let's see. Oh, going to the chat room. It's almost like it's a list list going on here.

345
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
What else does a nerd need besides Doctor Who, liquor, and games?

346
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,000
SSJ100Matt says boobs. You know, I'm a gay male and I'm not going to disagree with that. I need boobs too.

347
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You know what? Sometimes boobs get in the way.

348
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I will cosign that to the list. Fifth Dream says masturbation. No comment.

349
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Misty says Mountain Dew. I don't know.

350
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
No. Nasty shit.

351
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Maybe beverage of some type.

352
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Coffee.

353
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Okay. Coffee.

354
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Coffee.

355
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So a caffeinated beverage of some sort.

356
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I will let caffeinated beverages go, except Mountain Dew is nasty shit.

357
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Which, by the way, Rob, I have to say something, speaking of nerd drinks.

358
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Do you remember a soda called Josta?

359
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Oh God, yes. It sounds familiar for some reason.

360
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It was like this golden colored drink and it had a red and black label with a panther on it.

361
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It was put out by Pepsi, but Pepsi never put their logo on the label.

362
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And it went off the market fairly quickly. Josta was really good.

363
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And somebody brought a 15 year old can of it. Oh, I do remember this.

364
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Somebody brought a 15 year old can of it to a California extreme and you drank it.

365
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
No. I found a soda at the Russian market that tastes almost exactly like it. It's a Brazilian guarana soda.

366
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That is the most random thing you've ever said on this show.

367
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But Josta was made out of guarana.

368
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Hey y'all, remember Josta? Well you can get it at the Russian grocery store.

369
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Keep in mind, keep in mind, I used to drink this stuff and watch Sailor Moon marathons.

370
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Josta is the official drink of my Sailor Moon marathons, so you can stop laughing at me.

371
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Alright, so let me just add that to the list.

372
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Doctor Who, boobs, game, liquor. Apparently Josta and Sailor Moon are on the list too.

373
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Well I'm glad that the Josta clone or whatever was more important than playing Mass Effect this week.

374
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
No, looking for houses was more...

375
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Which by the way, the other...

376
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And by the way, it wasn't Russian, it was Brazilian, but it was a Brazilian soda at a Russian market.

377
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
By the way, the other comment we got in chat, this is a little bit delayed here,

378
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
but that the Gaben.tv song, the G-A-B-E-N dot TV song,

379
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
is appropriate for when Dark Sakura announces that she hasn't played Mass Effect for an entire week.

380
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Now this is supposed to be for the Steam sale.

381
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
This website is brilliant.

382
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I really think this should be the official thing that they launch with when you open Steam during the sale.

383
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It really should be that, but it just launches with that.

384
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Or whenever Jamie launches Mass Effect, it's a picture of Garrus that comes up.

385
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Are you ready for a miracle?

386
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You know, that song is gonna pull...

387
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That's what's... You know what's gonna happen when they play that song on Steam?

388
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's when Half-Life 3 gets announced.

389
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That's just gonna all of a sudden be like, hey, wait a second, this is from the Steam sale.

390
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Oh, whoa, now hold on a second. Something's different.

391
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
He's not dressed... He's dressed up like a...

392
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I want that song played at my 40th birthday.

393
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Alright, anyhow.

394
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I don't know who you people are. I'm leaving.

395
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You love us. Okay, My Gaming Week.

396
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
For dinner.

397
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
We haven't even done My Gaming Week yet.

398
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
My Gaming Week consisted of Loki's Ouya.

399
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
He let me borrow it.

400
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Now I was playing with some apps on it. I didn't get to play a lot of games, to be honest,

401
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
but one of the first things I had to do, because again, I'm a narcissist.

402
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
We talked about this earlier in the show.

403
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I had to download the TuneIn app and listen to VOG on the TuneIn app, which you can do.

404
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So if you own an Ouya, I urge you, go get the TuneIn app and check out VOG,

405
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
because we are on TuneIn and you can listen to us through your Ouya.

406
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I also played that parking valet simulator, the No Brakes Valet, whatever that's called.

407
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That game cracked me up. That was fun.

408
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And I was playing around with the Twitch TV app, which runs...

409
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I gotta say, it runs... No surprise, it's the exact same setup as the mobile Twitch TV,

410
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
but it runs very well. I wasn't getting any screens that were entirely black,

411
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
which I get a lot on mobile. I was getting a lot of good-looking feeds on Twitch TV.

412
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So that was pretty awesome. I like that.

413
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Also, as far as other games go, thank you Steam sale.

414
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I bought Scribblenauts Unlimited for $5, and I've been having fun with that.

415
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Scribblenauts, of course, is a puzzle game of sorts where you can type whatever object

416
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
that comes to mind to help you solve the puzzle.

417
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
For example, I was in a museum level and I had to put things on the paintings

418
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
that the people looking at them would appreciate.

419
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So, for example, there might be a caveman.

420
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So one thing that he might appreciate, a campfire.

421
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So you put in campfire and you put it in there.

422
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Scribblenauts Unlimited allows you to use the descriptive text,

423
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
so like you get an adjective, right?

424
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
When you have a red balloon or a red whatever.

425
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Or I think I had a mission where the guy was going to go pick a girl up on a date

426
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
and needed a cool ride, so I said, pink SUV.

427
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And I got credit for it.

428
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Should have done DeLorean.

429
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah, that's true.

430
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
The only negative I can think of for Scribblenauts Unlimited is it's more of a word puzzle

431
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
than it is platformer puzzle, at least in the early levels.

432
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Now, granted, I'm still early on.

433
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I probably have like 16 stars total, so I'm not like super far into the game.

434
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But I've played it for an hour or two.

435
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And I imagine the puzzles get more complicated later on

436
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
and maybe there's not so much maybe platforming,

437
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
but certainly the way that items would interact with other items

438
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
because I've seen a little bit of that so far.

439
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Like, I think at one point I called out an axe murderer

440
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
because somebody wanted to be scared.

441
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But the axe murderer actually ended up killing somebody,

442
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
and that was like a permanent thing.

443
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So you've got to be careful.

444
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Just watch out when you summon axe murderers.

445
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Maybe you should just do Creepy Stalker.

446
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Never summon Cthulhu. He will kill everything.

447
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That's what Cthulhu does. He's an older god.

448
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
All right. So, yeah.

449
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's a cute game.

450
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's kind of an elaborate word puzzler.

451
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The first few levels you're going to be kind of tapping your fingers on the desk

452
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
like, okay, this is pretty easy.

453
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I know what I'm going to do when I get to that level.

454
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
What?

455
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Little red Corvette.

456
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And if it's driven by prints, it'll be even better.

457
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I haven't really seen a sandbox stage.

458
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I mean, I guess you can always go back to the farm level

459
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and do whatever you want there,

460
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
but I was kind of surprised that, like, there isn't, like...

461
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Well, the first Scribblenauts game, it was just a mode that you just go in the sandbox.

462
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Yeah, I haven't really seen that in this, so...

463
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But anyway, it was five bucks. Amazing.

464
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Actdeft in chat says, I summon Cthulhu for a monster party.

465
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You do see some funny stuff, like in...

466
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I think it was in the diner level in the basement.

467
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
There's some monsters that are dancing around

468
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and they want another person to dance with them.

469
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So I summon Scary Unicorn,

470
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and it was a unicorn with a mask on that was scary.

471
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It is really cool how the game really can translate,

472
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
like, whatever you type into items.

473
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And you can even build your own items,

474
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
which is pretty cool and edit stuff, so...

475
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah, I was...

476
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
There's still a lot of fun to be had in it,

477
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
even if the game itself is pretty simple.

478
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Otherwise, other games I've been playing, not a lot of new stuff.

479
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Still the Final Fantasy XIV beta,

480
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
which Beta 3 finally ends this weekend.

481
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay, here's how much I've played the Final Fantasy XIV beta, you guys.

482
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I actually got to the point where it said,

483
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Well, that's all the story we have in the beta.

484
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You have completed everything in the beta.

485
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Go home!

486
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I got to that point in the story where it's like,

487
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Look forward to the release of the game.

488
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You beat the beta.

489
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And even then, Shane's like,

490
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Well, you can still go get your chocobo.

491
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You're not really done yet.

492
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Go get your chocobo.

493
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
We got more instances to run.

494
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I didn't play it all this weekend, Rob.

495
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah?

496
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Because I was...

497
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I think a lot of people are just kind of waiting for the release now.

498
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I have to save up the money so I can buy it.

499
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And also, they're going to nuke everybody pretty soon anyway,

500
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
so it's like, eh, why am I going to waste that time?

501
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But Beta 4 should be in about three weeks or so,

502
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and that supposedly is going to have the voice acting in the story quests

503
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and some other stuff too.

504
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It'll have more of the game.

505
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Oh, there's voice acting in the game?

506
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeah.

507
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
For the main story quests, there's going to be voice acting.

508
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah, I didn't know that until I read it, I think on Reddit.

509
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And it was out of a producer interview or something like that,

510
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
so I don't question its legitimacy.

511
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
But yeah, I'm loving Realm Reborn.

512
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
It's such good fan service.

513
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It's just so well done, especially the first game.

514
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
We don't acknowledge that anymore.

515
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
This is really what it should have been the whole time,

516
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and this is what people want out of a Final Fantasy MMO, I think.

517
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So, I don't know.

518
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Some Eleven purists would probably argue with me on that,

519
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
but I really think there's a lot of people that are going to be very happy with it.

520
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You know what I want out of an MMO?

521
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Final Fantasy XI, then go free to play.

522
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

523
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
WhatupG in chat asks,

524
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
How many hours did you put in Sky?

525
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I lost count. Is there a slash played?

526
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Easily 20. Easily.

527
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Probably more.

528
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And I'm not just talking this weekend.

529
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm talking kind of comprehensive across the beta,

530
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
but it's probably more.

531
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Sg100Matt says,

532
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn on max graphics settings is amazing.

533
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Soundtrack is great, too.

534
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Oh yeah, the soundtrack is phenomenal.

535
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I mean, to be fair, the soundtrack was actually pretty good in 1.0,

536
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
but a good soundtrack won't save a shitty game.

537
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So it's great that now there's this nice game

538
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
that the soundtrack compliments very well.

539
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I do need to turn down the crowd noise,

540
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
because there's some weird voices in the crowd noise

541
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
when you're in a crowded area.

542
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Like the one girl who goes, ha ha!

543
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It is neat, though, that when you go into crowded areas,

544
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
you get the crowd noises.

545
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
There's little things like that that really add to it.

546
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It's really cool.

547
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That was really it for my gaming week.

548
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh, the Mii Plaza games.

549
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I played those quickly.

550
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
A couple of those I checked out.

551
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
There is a space shooter-type game

552
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
where your Miis that you collect by street passing,

553
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
the color of their shirts determines the weapons

554
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
that you can place on your ship.

555
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So you can have a red shirt as a flamethrower,

556
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
a blue shirt as a homing missile,

557
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and then it's a little space shooter game,

558
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
so it's an awesome little addition to Mii Plaza.

559
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Bummer that they cost money,

560
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
but they're decent games for, what is it, $15 for the bundle?

561
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
For the four games?

562
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Great.

563
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
To register participation for this week's episode

564
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

565
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
use the passphrase, color.

566
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
All right, that's it for our gaming weeks,

567
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
so we can get into gaming news,

568
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
but quickly I'm just going to say housekeeping.

569
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Don't forget to add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R,

570
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and follow us on Facebook as well.

571
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Be our friend, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio,

572
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
or also on Google+.

573
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
All the places you can connect with us

574
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
are located at our website, orangeloungeradio.com.

575
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
There's a place in the upper right-hand corner

576
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
that has all these little logos

577
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
to the different places that we're at.

578
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I encourage you to follow us on Steam as well.

579
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I mentioned before we have our little Steam community

580
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
at the Voice of Geeks Network,

581
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
which you can see in the forums,

582
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
that if you're getting into the trading card whoring

583
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
like I am and like Loki inevitably will get into later,

584
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
check it out.

585
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
The only way that I would get into that

586
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
is if it was conveniently timed with a game that I'm playing,

587
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
because I'm not going to really play a game,

588
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
although I did for Super Meat Boy, I did play the game.

589
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And you gave me your cards,

590
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
so I'm more than happy with the way that turned out.

591
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And you know what though? I'm glad that I did,

592
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
because Super Meat Boy was an excellent game,

593
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and I do like it.

594
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's a great way to revisit games.

595
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I didn't talk about it during my gaming week,

596
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
but not only did I play Scribblenauts,

597
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I played Really Big Sky, I played Super Meat Boy,

598
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I played Magica, I played...

599
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
What else did I play to get cards out of?

600
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
There's something else, too.

601
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I mean, there's all these games I'm collecting cards in,

602
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and it forces me to go back and play the games again.

603
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah. So, anyways.

604
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Alright, so how popular are these next-gen systems going to be?

605
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I mean, I think they're going to be very popular,

606
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and if anything, we should learn from these pre-orders

607
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
that they are so popular that they're selling out

608
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
of their allotments.

609
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So yes, like any other console launch,

610
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
they're going to be hard to find at launch.

611
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So, for example, GameStop,

612
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
they've stopped taking pre-orders for the PlayStation 4,

613
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
and they are also running shorts, I guess,

614
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
on Xbox One systems, the day one edition.

615
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I guess, well, right now,

616
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
they are still selling some of the Xbox One bundles,

617
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
but a lot of them are gone, so they are almost out of those.

618
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Also, Amazon.

619
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
They have stopped taking pre-orders for the Xbox One

620
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
and the PlayStation 4 launch bundles as well.

621
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So, yeah.

622
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Probably the demand's been just very high for these things,

623
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
so that's got to be a good sign, unlike the Wii U.

624
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I don't know. We'll have to see.

625
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I remember there's still that rumor

626
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
that they're having some problems with the yields

627
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
from the chips for the Xbox One,

628
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
so that could possibly lead to some shortages there.

629
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
We'll see if there's anything to that.

630
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
But either way, it should be a very successful launch

631
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
as far as console numbers go.

632
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
SSG100Matt says,

633
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Of course there's going to be shortage.

634
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Gonna drive up demand as much as possible.

635
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yes, but I mean, honestly,

636
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I don't think they try to do it on purpose.

637
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I mean, granted, that's a wonderful side effect

638
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
of the console being popular.

639
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Unlike, you know, I seriously think with the Wii

640
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and the Wii U or whatever,

641
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
that they were shortening that stuff on purpose.

642
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
At least the Wii U, because I remember they were saying,

643
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Oh, it's so impossible to find,

644
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and yet it was just sitting on shelves

645
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
like all these different places.

646
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So I just kind of wonder about that stuff,

647
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
but I don't know.

648
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Once again, it's going to end up,

649
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
they're going to have to sell a lot of units

650
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to get the third-party support,

651
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
because if it's just not there,

652
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
if they're not selling any units,

653
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
then they're not going to sell games,

654
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and they're going to lose support.

655
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
They're going to develop for systems that have the numbers.

656
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
What systems would be left, the 360 and PS3?

657
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You'd be surprised, yeah.

658
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
They would just develop for current gen stuff.

659
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Let's see, in our chat room,

660
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
WhatUpG says,

661
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I think they are putting out more PlayStation 4 than Xbox One.

662
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Dungeon Buster says,

663
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
In Microsoft's case,

664
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
it could also be a continuing problem

665
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
with silicon yields for their new CPU.

666
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Alan Alchemy says,

667
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's only on purpose when Nintendo does it.

668
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Live.vognetwork.com.

669
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Well, okay.

670
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Here's why, and this is kind of going back to,

671
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
how long were there shortages on the Wii?

672
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Like, over a year.

673
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That's ridiculous.

674
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I mean, even with the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3,

675
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
there were shortages for maybe six months

676
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
when they were catching up on the demand stuff,

677
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
but then they were able to keep up with it.

678
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But the Wii, it was hard to find just forever.

679
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It was ridiculous.

680
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Seeing the day-to-day operation of how Nintendo works,

681
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
they do allocate a lot of stuff

682
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
where they kind of hold back things

683
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
that they could possibly sell

684
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and place them in certain places.

685
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
For example, there may be shortages for some retailers,

686
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
but other retailers are getting product

687
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
because they're filling the demand there first

688
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and shorting everybody else,

689
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
or they're holding back

690
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
because they don't want any extra units

691
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
sitting on the shelves

692
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
to make it seem like that the system is selling out.

693
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Like the Wii U, they didn't hold back systems,

694
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and there were some sitting on the shelves,

695
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and that definitely let people know

696
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
that it isn't selling out,

697
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
and so I guess maybe that could have possibly affected

698
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
demand on it or something.

699
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I don't really know.

700
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I don't think it would,

701
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
but I guess that could be their train of thought.

702
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Way too early to still call a victor this year, though, right?

703
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Anything still happen?

704
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Oh, yeah.

705
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
All I'm going to say is

706
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Nintendo has got their work cut out for them

707
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
to really sell those consoles

708
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
because they're betting that these first-party tiles

709
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
are going to sell consoles in.

710
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Don't get me wrong.

711
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I mean, Nintendo, Mario games are great.

712
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
They do remain the cheapest option on the table.

713
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
They are the cheapest option.

714
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Oh, speaking of cheap options, actually,

715
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I was going to say there is a PlayStation 3 SKU

716
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
coming out next month for $199.

717
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
What?

718
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah.

719
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Oh.

720
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
PlayStation 3, wow.

721
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
PlayStation 3.

722
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That's still, wow, that's great.

723
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
However, the hard drive is really small.

724
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It's a 12-gig hard drive.

725
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
They had it in Europe right now.

726
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
They were selling it.

727
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But 12-gig hard drive for $199,

728
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
that's still pretty cheap.

729
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And, I mean, granted, those hard drives are replaceable,

730
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
and you can get a cheap hard drive,

731
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
so it might be an easy way to get in

732
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
if you want a PlayStation 3 system.

733
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So there's that.

734
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I mean, that might go through the holidays.

735
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Well, that'll help out.

736
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But, yeah, I mean, seriously,

737
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I hope that that Mario game does really well for them.

738
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I hope that Mario game and Zelda and stuff

739
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
really does sell systems for them,

740
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
because if it doesn't,

741
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't know much more of what they can do.

742
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I mean, Mario Kart will be good,

743
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
but they may be in the shitter for another year.

744
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah.

745
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, I don't think they're just going to stop.

746
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Nintendo themselves will not stop supporting Wii U.

747
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
No, I understand that.

748
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You'll still see games

749
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that people are going to want on that

750
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
for the next couple of years.

751
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It's just, you know, it may not be the powerhouse

752
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
that the Wii was without all the other third-party support,

753
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
but, I mean, Nintendo will still make games for their own system

754
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
while they work on the successor.

755
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And a lot of games are, you know,

756
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Nintendo, people that buy Nintendo systems,

757
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
a lot of times buy it for Nintendo games.

758
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So it's not a huge loss,

759
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
but it does affect, you know,

760
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
if you want to buy a system

761
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
or if you're contemplating buying another system,

762
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
like, let's consider it next-gen.

763
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I still don't consider the Wii U next-gen

764
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
because of the, you know, hardware and stuff,

765
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
but let's, if you're considering a next-gen system

766
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and you're looking at, okay,

767
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
all the games that are coming out that I want to play

768
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
and the, you know, Wii U is missing a lot of them,

769
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
you know, you just might not buy the system.

770
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah.

771
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And by the way,

772
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
just because I say Nintendo working on a successor,

773
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I don't mean like they're hurrying a successor,

774
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
but it's very common that the research and development

775
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
of these systems is years in advance.

776
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
PlayStation 5 is probably already being worked on

777
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
very, very, very slowly in its early planning stages,

778
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
but, you know.

779
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
If the roadmaps are meant, are to be believed,

780
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
you know, the one that leaked out for the, you know,

781
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
the Xbox system and the Kinect and the VR stuff,

782
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Microsoft's working on some VR stuff, so.

783
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
We'll see.

785
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Next year is apparently when that's supposed to come out.

786
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We'll see.

787
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
All right, moving on, speaking of Microsoft,

788
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
apparently the, as Bobby likes to call them,

789
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
the Microsoft SpaceBucks, or the Microsoft points,

790
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
they're being phased out.

791
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Now, we kind of knew that that was going to be happening

792
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
at some point.

793
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I believe that came up during E3,

794
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
but it is actually now kind of dated

795
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
when that's all going to go down.

796
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
The Xbox Live Rewards will be doing away with these bonuses

797
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
as of August 1st, okay,

798
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
but the Xbox Live Rewards program will still be there in place.

799
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Apparently, September 1st is when we'll have more information

800
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
on whatever the Xbox Live Rewards program turns into.

801
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I think this is the program that gives you, like,

802
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
20 points on your birthday.

803
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Like, ooh, Microsoft gave me a quarter.

804
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Woo-hoo!

805
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But in the Xbox Live beta, apparently some problems right now

806
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
in the new, you know, the new dashboard build is being previewed

807
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
that's going to roll out in the fall,

808
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
and I guess some problems there about some negative exchange rates

809
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
and some that are too favorable,

810
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
incorrect game title pricing in wrong regions and so forth,

811
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
but, you know, it is a beta,

812
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
so you can't exactly sit there and go,

813
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Microsoft, you suck.

814
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I mean, that's what you get when you sign up for a beta

815
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
is that things are going to screw up.

816
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
We can still say they suck,

817
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
but we just can't say that that sucks.

818
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Yeah, I don't understand how they can't, like,

819
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
are you telling me that Microsoft is confused

820
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
on how their space bucks work?

821
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I mean, granted, I know it's easy for the, you know,

822
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
North America and stuff where it's, like,

823
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
you know, 80 points equals a dollar,

824
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
but, like, you know, in other regions,

825
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm sure it's X amount of points equals, you know, whatever.

826
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
With so much crap in the marketplace, though,

827
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I'm sure it's a database conversion issue.

828
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Like, it's one wrong little line of code that fucks everything up.

829
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I'm sure it's something that simple.

830
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It's got to be.

831
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So, I don't know yet exactly when the points will move into dollars,

832
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
but it's going to be before probably this same September timeframe.

833
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And the 20 points thing on your birthday.

834
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I don't even think I got that.

835
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Who even cares?

836
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
That is just so ridiculously stupid.

837
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
What can you buy with 20 points?

838
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:35,000
There was someone at, I think it was Flaco Jones who said,

839
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
you know, hey, I got 20 points on my birthday.

840
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And I'm like, don't spend it all in one place.

841
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
How can you not spend it all in one place?

842
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
There's only 20 points.

843
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Geez.

844
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
All right. Let's move on.

845
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Dark Sakura.

846
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Let's see.

847
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Well, you know how we've talked about the poor sales of the Wii U

848
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
are probably going to start affecting third party markets

849
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
as far as what gets developed for them.

850
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Well, it looks like Ubisoft has come out and said

851
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
that they're not doing a sequel to Zombie U just for that reason.

852
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
That basically the Wii U hasn't sold enough

853
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
and the game itself, Zombie U, hasn't sold enough.

854
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So even though they have a prototype of a sequel,

855
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
they are not going to pursue development.

856
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
There will be no Zombie U 2.

857
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
No Zombie The Edge, no Zombie Bono.

858
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It's probably going to be called something else, be my guess.

859
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And it's going to be Multiplatform because that's why they can't, they know.

860
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And that's sad too because Zombie U is probably one of the most successful

861
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
third party games they had at launch.

862
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I was really surprised by this news.

863
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It was that bad.

864
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Well, they've delayed Rayman Legends

865
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
for the reason of putting it on Multiplatform.

866
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I think that's exactly what's going to happen with it.

867
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Especially now that you have the next-gen consoles or whatever

868
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
going to have all the second screen support anyway,

869
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
you can still do all that stuff that they have in Zombie U.

870
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Just do it with the second screen.

871
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Or you can make a lot of that stuff optional.

872
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
So I think that they're going to have another zombie game,

873
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
but it just probably won't be called Zombie U.

874
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Instead of calling it Zombie U, call it Zombie Them.

875
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Zombie Me.

876
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Zombie Us.

877
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Zombie One.

878
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I was surprised to hear that it was that bad,

879
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
but it also kind of shed some light on why they pulled the plug

880
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
on the Rayman thing so fast.

881
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's exactly the same reason.

882
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yeah.

883
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I mean, because we didn't know this then,

884
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
and we were kind of like, Ubisoft's just being dicks.

885
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
You know, but I guess financially that's what it is.

886
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I didn't say that.

887
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Yeah, well.

888
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Well, it's the one time that Mr. Negative over there,

889
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Norman Negative, is right.

890
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
All right, anyhow.

891
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
What else we got?

892
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Next up.

893
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

894
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I beat Raginator.

895
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Huh?

896
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
To my really awful U2 joke.

897
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You beat him with your shoe?

898
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Zombie Bono.

899
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So, you know, one of the things that PlayStation 4

900
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
was going to allow developers to do

901
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
is self-publish on the PlayStation Network.

902
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And, you know, basically their thought is, you know,

903
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
we're going to treat every single individual developer

904
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
as a publisher as far as we're concerned.

905
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And we don't separate, we don't segregate indies

906
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
from traditional publishers,

907
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
which I think is a fantastic thing.

908
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I think it's awesome that you see these indie games

909
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
next to, you know, big budget games and stuff.

910
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And I, honestly, it's kind of refreshing

911
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
compared to, like, the stuff that was happening

912
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
with the Xbox indie games,

913
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
where it's just like, yeah, we got the indie games,

914
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
but they're tucked away in a corner in a closet

915
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
underneath some clothes and stuff.

916
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And you might be able to find them, you know, if you dig.

917
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So I'm glad to see that they're actually doing that,

918
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
and hopefully it is a little bit easier

919
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
to publish on the PlayStation Network.

920
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
So, I mean, and so far, I know,

921
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
at least with the PlayStation 3,

922
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I think it's been pretty easy for them,

923
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
and even PlayStation Vita, so that's just only good things.

924
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And that kind of also carries on over to the Vita as well,

925
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
because, you know, the Vita could always use more games.

926
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
This indie thing has really been great for Sony, too.

927
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I mean, that was one thing people were very excited about at E3,

928
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
was all their indie developers on the stage,

929
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
and kind of one of the places where PlayStation

930
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
kind of gave Microsoft a little kick in the butt, too,

931
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
because there's been a lot of negative about Microsoft.

932
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Do you think that Microsoft might change some of their strategy

933
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
when it comes to Xbox One?

934
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I think Microsoft's strategy with the Xbox One,

935
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
or not even really with the Xbox,

936
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
because now they're kind of treating all their platforms as one platform.

937
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I think the problem is they know that people want to develop games

938
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
for the Xbox One, but they also know

939
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
they have a lack of application support on Windows 8.

940
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
So therein is going to be basically,

941
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
hey, develop games for the Windows 8 platform, and guess what?

942
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Because we have that kernel running on,

943
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
or that version of the firmware or whatever,

944
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
however you're going to split it up,

945
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
we have that running on the Xbox One,

946
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
your games will be able to be ported over to the Xbox One very easily.

947
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
That's how they're going to win on both platforms,

948
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
because they want to sell those operating systems,

949
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
because that's where they're probably going to make a lot of money.

950
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And at the same time, they also want to have stuff on their console,

951
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I just think that that's what they're going to try to do,

952
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
is try to get people, almost like,

953
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:44,000
trick them into making games for the Microsoft platform, I guess.

954
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Shadownextgen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

955
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
you have to worry about whether PlayStation Network on PS4

956
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
will turn into the App Store, though.

957
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
That's a good point.

958
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I mean, the App Store has a lot of crap on it,

959
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
like a lot of crap.

960
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Like, how many fart apps do we need, right?

961
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Flashlight apps, really?

962
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Yeah, exactly.

963
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I don't think it's going to happen that way, though,

964
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
because even right now with the way PlayStation Network's indie games are,

965
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
it's easier for them to get on,

966
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
but I don't think it's like, you know,

967
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
they can just throw games up there like you can on the indie store.

968
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I don't know, it'll be interesting to see how they do it.

969
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Do you think there will be some type of quality review process?

970
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I think so.

971
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Because the problem is you open it up too much,

972
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
and that's where you start getting all the IP theft stuff, too.

973
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Like, we've heard about the stuff in the App Store

974
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,000
that was like literal ripoffs of games that existed other places.

975
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I remember there was one, like a Pokémon app.

976
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
All it was was pictures of Pokémon,

977
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
but people legit thought it was like Nintendo's Pokémon on the App Store,

978
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and people were downloading it like crazy and losing money on it.

979
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I think that they'll probably have some sort of review process in there,

980
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
and, you know, they'll probably just, they have just a fun and happy medium.

981
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I mean, you can't just make it super duper easy to put stuff on there.

982
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I mean, look at, like, for example, the Ouya.

983
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
There's a perfect example of how you can self-publish on there,

984
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
but there's not a ton of stuff on there.

985
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
That store is a mess, too, I gotta say.

986
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Okay, well, that store has been a mess since launch,

987
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
especially with their, like, fucked up, like, menus and stuff.

988
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
The way to navigate that is, it's not very well,

989
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
and, like, you know, you look at, like, all the different bars that feature things,

990
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and, like, every single one of them has got the same games in it,

991
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
just in a different order.

992
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It's like the Wii U store when it first launched,

993
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
or not too much different now.

994
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Yeah, so it's just kind of weird,

995
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
but they do have it where you can easily publish stuff on there,

996
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
but I think it's just some sort of, you know, quality sorting and stuff,

997
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
and just, you know, better ways to search for what you're actually looking for.

998
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Alright, well, you know, THQ had some problems last year,

999
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and they went bankrupt, and, you know, a lot of their properties went to all these different places,

1000
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
hence why, you know, we have Deep Silver doing Saints Row now, and so forth,

1001
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
but Sega, apparently not happy with the way things went down,

1002
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
because they filed a claim against THQ, and bankruptcy court, of course,

1003
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
because THQ is bankrupt, for almost a million dollars,

1004
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
just shy of that, about $941,000.

1005
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
That apparently is the amount that THQ received in pre-orders,

1006
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
after Valve's cut, for Company of Heroes 2.

1007
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Apparently, Eurogamer had also reported that about a half million was made

1008
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
after THQ filed for bankruptcy,

1009
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,000
so Sega wants to get that money back that came in from pre-orders for Company of Heroes 2.

1010
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Double Fine, Codemasters, and other former THQ executives

1011
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
also looking for the money that they're supposed to be getting.

1012
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
This doesn't mean any of them will get anything.

1013
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I imagine this is part of the process, filing the claim,

1014
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
so you can ultimately later on claim it as a loss when it comes to tax season later on,

1015
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
but it's interesting that this THQ drama still goes on.

1016
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
By the way, the reason why Sega wants the money is because they got Relic, the developer,

1017
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
and the Company of Heroes property,

1018
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
they bought that for $26.6 million at the THQ asset auction.

1019
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
So, that's what's going down. Sega wants their money.

1020
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
They want to buy their building back from Zynga.

1021
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I wish.

1022
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You know, they say, if we had a million dollars, we could make Dreamcast 2.

1023
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,000
If I had a million dollars, maybe Sonic 4 wouldn't suck.

1024
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
You know, it's funny the difference between what a million dollars is to you ten years ago versus now.

1025
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Right. Anyhow.

1026
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Now I'm like, house! I can buy a house!

1027
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Well, did you know that video games can become professional sports, according to the US government?

1028
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I remember when we used to talk about when is DDR going to become a sport.

1029
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I know, right? Well, you know what made it?

1030
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It was in Finland or something, wasn't it?

1031
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I think. But you know what made it officially? League of Legends.

1032
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It has now been considered, and this is a quote coming from Riot Games,

1033
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:16,000
esports manager Nick Allen, said the United States government recognizes League of Legends pro players as professional athletes

1034
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and awards visas to essentially work in the United States under that title.

1035
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:29,000
So, yeah. It is officially an esports, and the pro players are e-thletes, as I'm calling them.

1036
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
That's my new word, and you have to give credit to me. E-thlete.

1037
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I don't know if you're the first person I've heard that term from.

1038
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Well, you know what? I'm saying it, so whatever.

1039
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,000
But this means that, yeah, you can actually apply for a visa if you're a professional e-thlete.

1040
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
You know what this also means? We can just add this to the list of sports that I'm terrible at,

1041
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
which is right up there with baseball and basketball and football, League of Legends.

1042
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
There you go. That's why this is a sport because I'm terrible at it.

1043
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Do you suck at croquet?

1044
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Yes, actually I do.

1045
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You know, I cannot play croquet without singing Que Sera Sera to myself because of Heathers.

1046
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm pretty good at miniature golf.

1047
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So am I. My husband's really good at it.

1048
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Is that a sport? Is mini golf a sport?

1049
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It is officially in my universe.

1050
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Okay, well that's all I need.

1051
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Well, I've been talking about forming the island of awesome, and I think the national sport of the island of awesome should be mini golf.

1052
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I honestly think that they should make mini golf courses the size of actual golf courses and televise that shit,

1053
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
because I want to see someone doing a drive off of a giant loop-de-loop and all sorts of crazy stuff.

1054
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It could be right there with dodgeball and League of Legends on the Ocho.

1055
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's been eight. The Ocho.

1056
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Gamergirl in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

1057
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Then I guess this means Dota 2 is next?

1058
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
You know, that's a good comment because, you know,

1059
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:56,000
it brings this interesting area where you've got a game that's essentially owned by a company as a sport.

1060
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I mean, what about all the competitors that make similar games?

1061
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
We're going to have Blizzard, All-Stars, Valve has Dota 2. Isn't there another one?

1062
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
There's another one I'm not thinking of. There's another smaller one.

1063
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Because, you know, all those guys that contributed to the original Defense of the Ancients mod in Warcraft 3

1064
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
all went their own separate ways, so you got all these games because of it.

1065
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Is Dota 2 going to be a sport? Or what happens next?

1066
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
How do you guys feel about-

1067
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I still think we want pro DDR.

1068
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
How do you guys feel about- but DDR's dead, yo. Haven't you got the memo?

1069
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
No, it's not.

1070
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
It's like the disco boys in Mystery Men. Eddie Izzard. DDR is life.

1071
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
No, it's death.

1072
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
After we're done playing.

1073
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Loki, what do you think about video games becoming sports?

1074
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It's kind of ridiculous to call it a sport.

1075
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I mean, just call it something else, but it's not like a sport.

1076
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Isn't that what gamers want?

1077
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I guess if you want to call chess a sport, then I guess we can call video games a sport.

1078
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But, I mean, I don't know. I always think of sports as something, like, active.

1079
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I mean, even chess is kind of like, ehhh.

1080
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
You can sweat playing chess.

1081
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
In a hot room.

1082
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I mean, I don't know.

1083
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Whatever. I mean, fine.

1084
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
But, those people are- you're not going to see it in the fucking Olympics, okay?

1085
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
It's just not going to happen.

1086
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
And don't even try to, like, petition that shit.

1087
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Tiger Claw says it's called eSports.

1088
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It's like new sports.

1089
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Will we have the Olympics?

1090
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
That'll be actually kind of cool.

1091
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
For our eathletes.

1092
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Shouldn't it be Sports 2.0? Because, you know, the whole, like, Web 2.0 shit.

1093
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
ActDeft.

1094
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I want Robot Jocks.

1095
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
ActDeft in chat.

1096
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
For reals.

1097
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
ActDeft in chat says, how about stuff like EVO?

1098
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Well, that's all going on right now. Like, that's a huge Olympics type of thing.

1099
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
That's only for fighting games.

1100
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
But still, I mean, getting quite a bit of viewership and controversy of its own online.

1101
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
So, we'll get into it later in the show.

1102
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So.

1103
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Man, I like EVO when there's, like, people that no one's ever heard of who just come in and kick ass.

1104
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Yeah.

1105
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Well, that's like any sport.

1106
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Yeah, but I really like it in Street Fighter because I've played a bunch of, you know, people who are really good.

1107
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And sometimes they can be dicks.

1108
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's like Wimbledon. It always makes headlines.

1109
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I liked watching the video from, I think it was EVO last year, where they had I Wanna Be the Guy Guy Den.

1110
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Mm-hmm.

1111
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
That's a good name.

1112
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
That was awesome.

1113
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Infinel in our chatroom says, next, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics will be in eSports.

1114
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
That's very meta. I like that idea.

1115
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
We'll see.

1116
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
We'll see.

1117
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
All right, moving on to release dates.

1118
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
We're going to travel around the world and check out what games are coming out that could be a sport in a few years.

1119
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
We'll see. Loki?

1120
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Well, I don't know about any of the games you're going to support this week.

1121
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
But, because, like, for example, there's Turbo Super Stunt Squad, which is a game based on the-

1122
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Is it turbo-tastic?

1123
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Probably not.

1124
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It's based on that Dreamworks movie about the snail that somehow ingests NOS and so becomes, like, a super fast snail.

1125
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Because, you know, that's science right there.

1126
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Mm-hmm.

1127
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,000
So, they have that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.

1128
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Also, this week, your ever yearly multi-release version of you versus a bunch of other feudal Japan warriors.

1129
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Dynasty Warriors 8 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1130
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Also, this week, Time of Eternity on PlayStation 3.

1131
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Let's see, the Serious Sam collection being released on Xbox 360.

1132
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
There's a bunch of Xbox Live arcade games that were on there.

1133
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I want to see. I think that might be it.

1134
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Am I missing something?

1135
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And that's it.

1136
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Let me move to Japan then and if Loki thinks-

1137
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Bye, Rob.

1138
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Bye.

1139
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Bye, I'm moving.

1140
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Alright, moving to the Japanese release dates.

1141
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Final Fantasy XIII-2 gets a price reduction on the PlayStation 3 on July 18th.

1142
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Shin Sangokumusou Online Z in regular edition and Treasure Box edition comes out on the 18th as well.

1143
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
This is Dynasty Warriors Online, right?

1144
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
That's what that is.

1145
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
That's on the PlayStation 3.

1146
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Going to the Xbox 360.

1147
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Final Fantasy XIII-2 gets its reduction there too.

1148
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
There's like a digital contents version and platinum collection.

1149
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Oh, I bet digital contents is just all the DLC.

1150
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Like the Saw's side story and all the stuff that came out for XIII-2.

1151
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
There was a lot of DLC for XIII-2.

1152
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Okay.

1153
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
So, yeah. You don't care about XIII-2?

1154
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I'm just like-

1155
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Pass.

1156
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I'm agreeing with you. I'm like, okay.

1157
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Okay.

1158
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Well, there's nothing to debate here, Darus Sakura.

1159
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
These are the release dates.

1160
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And I'm just accepting them.

1161
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I've accepted them into my version of reality.

1162
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Alright, fine.

1163
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You will import them into Planet Sakura.

1164
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I am incorporating them into my own virtual consciousness.

1165
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Fair enough.

1166
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
On the Wii U.

1167
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Yes, Sniper Elite V2 is out this week from Ubisoft in Japan.

1168
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Sniper Elite, that's a game that's out here?

1169
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Is that like one of the small Clancy games?

1170
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
No, it's a World War II sniper game.

1171
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Nintendo 3DS sees a little bit this week.

1172
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Mario & Luigi RPG 4 Dream Adventure comes out this week from Nintendo.

1173
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Damball Senkai W. Cho Custom comes out this week from level 5.

1174
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
There is a special Luigi Nintendo 3DS XL this week.

1175
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I don't know if it's like green or what the-

1176
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I gotta see what this is.

1177
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Is it a green?

1178
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I mean, it has to be, right?

1179
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Oh, it's like-

1180
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
No, it's white.

1181
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But it has like little green silhouettes of Luigi all over it.

1182
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Green and teal and light green.

1183
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And barfy yellow.

1184
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Easter egg.

1185
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
There is one of those that's actually a Mario.

1186
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Oh, really?

1187
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Yeah, you said it looked great.

1188
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
That like snuck on there? Like a red one?

1189
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
No, it's not red. It's green, but it's a Mario.

1190
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Look for the squat, Mario.

1191
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
It must be on the-

1192
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I think it's on the back.

1193
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah, it must be on the back because I don't see it in the little box art here.

1194
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I am surprised that DJ Rama S doesn't try and import one of these.

1195
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So, we'll see.

1196
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Maybe he will.

1197
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Also on the 3DS this week,

1198
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Shin Sekaiju no Miku Design Skins

1199
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Oh, those aren't even games. Those are just little skins for the 3DS.

1200
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Osahare Hamster 2 Korosau Ishoni Orakake comes out this week.

1201
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Do something together?

1202
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Play with adorable hamsters.

1203
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Oh my gosh, it's Hamster Sam.

1204
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Maybe it's just play together.

1205
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Oh my god, the box. This is adorable.

1206
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Why do we get games like this here?

1207
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
They're on a sunflower.

1208
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
The hamsters are sitting on a sunflower.

1209
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Wearing bows.

1210
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
One is wearing a tiara.

1211
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And then you look at the game shots.

1212
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
And they're playing in this cherry blossom field.

1213
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
With a little hamster wheel.

1214
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And then there's one underwater here.

1215
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
And then here's one with the hamsters. They're just chilling at the beach.

1216
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
This little chief hamster there sitting in a lounge chair.

1217
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Just chilling at the beach.

1218
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That's not realistic at all.

1219
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
First off, they were in the field of flowers.

1220
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
They're not going to have Richard Gere's asshole as a level.

1221
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
No, I understand that. I'm not saying that they do that.

1222
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
They'd be running from owls level.

1223
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I'm just saying that they would just shove in their face full of food.

1224
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Because that's all hamsters do. Shove their face full of food.

1225
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And poop.

1226
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
They throw their poop, actually.

1227
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Because they like to keep their cage clean.

1228
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
So they huck it like footballs.

1229
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And they pee on you when they're nervous.

1230
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Yes.

1231
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Rama is pointing out that he's not interested in this 3DSXL because it's region locked.

1232
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Well, you know what? We need to find a way to un-region lock

1233
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Osahare hamster to Kuraso Isho ni Oda Kake.

1234
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Because, again, here's the game.

1235
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Yeah, I think it says let's play together.

1236
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Here's a game that we need in America.

1237
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Why don't we have this game in America?

1238
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And Nintendo's fascist state 3DS will not allow me to import this game.

1239
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
This is a challenge to OLR listeners now.

1240
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
If you have a hamster, I want you to put a bow on it and send me a picture.

1241
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
But keep the hamster. Oh my god, don't harm the hamster.

1242
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Don't glue it to the hamsters head, you know, like, or what do they do?

1243
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Staple it to the hamsters.

1244
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Safety first.

1245
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And Scrooged. That movie is great.

1246
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
But, like, I want to see, or you can Photoshop a tiara onto your hamster.

1247
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I want to see your glammed up hamsters.

1248
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Photoshop dark soccer's face.

1249
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Glampsters. Yes, that's it.

1250
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
That's the game that we need, Rob.

1251
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Oh my god, is that a dream game?

1252
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
OLR dream game, glampsters.

1253
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Glampsters.

1254
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Hold on, hold on.

1255
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Okay, yes.

1256
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
There have been games by Activision.

1257
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
There's actually, I believe, like a pet's hamsters with a Z in there.

1258
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And they have had games where it's pet's fashion where you actually do dress up.

1259
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It is not that cute.

1260
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
But there's also a hamtaro game.

1261
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I don't, you know.

1262
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:47,000
But not like little CG actual looking hamsters that are adorable, that wear bows and tiaras and go to the beach.

1263
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I want Photoshop of a hamster with a crown on a beach chair.

1264
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
That's my challenge. I mean, I could do it myself, but I'm lazy.

1265
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
We're just gonna, no. This is a whole president cat thing going on here.

1266
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Because who made this?

1267
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
We need to start harassing them.

1268
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Nippon Columbia, yes. I want their Twitter harassed.

1269
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
And we're gonna call this game Glamsters, is the US localization title.

1270
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And I want Glamsters in the, I don't even know what it translates to.

1271
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Who cares? It's Glamsters.

1272
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And I want Glamsters in the US.

1273
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Rob, the name is essentially playing with hamsters, or playing together with hamsters.

1274
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Glamsters.

1275
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Who made this? Nippon Columbia.

1276
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Can we, what's their Twitter?

1277
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
O.L. Army, get to work. Bring me a Twitter.

1278
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Alright.

1279
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Where is Ikuma JP when we need him?

1280
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I know. I mean, I appreciate Ikuma JP every week he listens, but I really need him tonight.

1281
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Where is he?

1282
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Ikuma-san, find us this Twitter.

1283
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Alright. We need you.

1284
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Anyhow, let's move on to the UK.

1285
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Captain Planet.

1286
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
While we plan our wishes to get Glamsters localized.

1287
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I wish I could move to the UK, then I could avoid the bullshit here.

1288
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Alright.

1289
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Sorry.

1290
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
On the 14th, which is, what, today?

1291
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Isn't it now?

1292
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Mega Man Unlimited for PC.

1293
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
On the 16th, Mamoru-kun Curse on PlayStation 3.

1294
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
On the 18th, Plants vs. Zombies 2. It's about time.

1295
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
And that wasn't me saying that. That's actually the title.

1296
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And guess what? I'm spent.

1297
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I'm surprised Mega Man Unlimited was listed on there. I think that's a fan game.

1298
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Yeah, I think it's a fan game. We're kind of surprised that's on there.

1299
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Well, it's on there so good for them.

1300
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Yeah. Got good reviews.

1301
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1302
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Alright, so, yeah. Apparently, websites be getting hacked again.

1303
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,000
So, Bohemia Interactive had their website hacked.

1304
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And you may remember them for the ARMA series.

1305
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
And also, basically, they've had to reset all of the user's passwords.

1306
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
As a precautionary measure.

1307
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
They basically said that credit card information was not stored on the server.

1308
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:17,000
And they weren't sure what was taken during the breach.

1309
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Or if anything.

1310
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But basically, all the stored passwords were encrypted.

1311
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And they're saying it's very unlikely anything can be done with the passwords.

1312
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
But, you know, they reset them.

1313
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So, you got to make a new one anyways. There you go.

1314
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And Konami has also been hacked as well.

1315
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Konami's ID portal website had a large batch of unauthorized logins.

1316
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I guess during the month of June.

1317
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And basically saying that it's exposed some customer information.

1318
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And they recommend changing your passwords.

1319
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
So, yeah.

1320
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
And apparently also the information that may have been exposed.

1321
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Customer names, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, email addresses.

1322
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And that's it.

1323
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So, change of passwords.

1324
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yeah.

1325
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Hackers gonna hack.

1326
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Yep.

1327
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I hope your password that you used on these websites was not the same that you used on your bank website.

1328
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Because that would have been a really bad idea.

1329
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
That's why these things get hacked.

1330
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
For people that use the same password everywhere.

1331
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Well, maybe you'll see Glamsters on the show floor at Tokyo Game Show.

1332
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Actually you won't because it's already out in Japan.

1333
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
But we can still dream it will still show up at Tokyo Game Show.

1334
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Tokyo Game Show had its list of exhibitors announced this week.

1335
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
When is Tokyo Game Show? October-ish?

1336
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Usually September.

1337
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
September? Yeah, it is September.

1338
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
The exhibitor list is out and Microsoft's on it.

1339
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Which is a bit of a surprise because the Xbox One.

1340
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Why are you laughing over there?

1341
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:01,000
We got all these cool things to show you that we're not releasing this year because the Xbox One's not coming to your region because you're second tier.

1342
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Xbox One coming to the second tier country of Japan.

1343
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Sorry, I don't say that to be offensive but the reality is that since Japan didn't support the first Xbox.

1344
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Do they have cosplay at Tokyo Game Show?

1345
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Yes.

1346
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Oh yeah.

1347
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Good, someone can cosplay at Tumbleweed and maybe roll through the booth.

1348
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
You're such an ass.

1349
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Microsoft's also going to be going to Gamescom if anyone's keeping track of that.

1350
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
But yeah, it'll be interesting.

1351
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Also, folks at Tokyo Game Show.

1352
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Sony, Capcom, EA, Sega, Squeenix, Konami, Namco Bandai, Tecmo Koei, Bethesda.

1353
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
All those folks are going to be at Tokyo Game Show.

1354
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Guess who's not there?

1355
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Because they're never there.

1356
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Nintendo. Nintendo will not be there.

1357
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
But they never do Tokyo Game Show.

1358
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
They usually do their own thing that same week.

1359
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Because they're Nintendo and that's what they do.

1360
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Alright, Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with a comment on the hacking article saying it is Konami's own fault they were hacked.

1361
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Their code was up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

1362
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Womp, womp, womp, womp.

1363
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
You shouldn't use the same code in every game that you make.

1364
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
There you go.

1365
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Actually it's different in Proteus.

1366
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Wasn't it like literally backwards?

1367
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
It was backwards.

1368
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Silly.

1369
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Alright, well, speaking of games that the Konami code might work on, we're going to take a trip down memory lane.

1370
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
It won't work on this game.

1371
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
That code really did work in a lot of games.

1372
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Yeah, not this game because this week is not a Konami game.

1373
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
But it is the classic game of the week.

1374
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:40,000
DarkSakura is going to jump into her gaming vault or maybe she'll go to an expo and see a lot of classic games and find one that she thinks, hey, respect this game or get out of my planet.

1375
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Yeah.

1376
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Off my planet.

1377
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Get off my patch of land here.

1378
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1379
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Pinbot.

1380
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Ooh, good choice.

1381
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Yes.

1382
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
And it's actually not the table.

1383
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It's the NES game that Rare developed.

1384
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Excellent choice.

1385
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Um, the game came out.

1386
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Crap, I didn't link the YouTube.

1387
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Yeah, Rob.

1388
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Sorry, it'll take me a minute to get the audio.

1389
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Got everybody.

1390
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I'm sorry for Rob.

1391
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Shut up.

1392
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I'm sorry for you.

1393
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I'm sorry for your face.

1394
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
There we go.

1395
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Aw, epic Rare soundtrack.

1396
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Got it now.

1397
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Didn't have such good music.

1398
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Can we just listen to this for a minute?

1399
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Sure.

1400
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I don't want to hear you talk.

1401
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I just want to hear this.

1402
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
You what?

1403
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Ah, sexy lady Pinbot.

1404
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I like her, uh, electro boots.

1405
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Alright, I suppose you can talk now.

1406
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Anyway, the game came out in North America in 1990 and it was a version of the same pinball

1407
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
machine that Williams did in 1986.

1408
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:45,000
The NES version actually has most of the stuff from the machine and graphically is pretty

1409
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
darn accurate, I think.

1410
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Um, even down, I like how they even have like the Williams logo at the bottom and how they

1411
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
did the scores where the normal price things are.

1412
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Um, so the point really is just to get points.

1413
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You start off with your marker set on Pluto and you have to go through the solar system

1414
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,000
by hitting different targets and different checkpoint planets give you a special so you

1415
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
get extra balls that way and when you reach the sun you get a super special so you get

1416
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
another extra ball.

1417
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Um, you have the visor too which basically works exactly like it does in the arcade machine

1418
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and I'm sure, I really hope most of you have played the legit for reals pinball, I mean,

1419
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Pinbot before.

1420
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Um, but you have a 5x5 grid that has drop targets and once you've hit them the grid

1421
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
lights, the visor opens and you can lock the balls there to start your multiball and in

1422
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
this game it is a double multiball.

1423
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
So, you can also relock balls while they're in multiball and get extra points.

1424
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:52,000
So with this, um, basically the, to get such a long play field it actually crops it where

1425
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:59,000
your flippers are and the top screen moves until it reconnects to wherever it would be

1426
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
once they're joined.

1427
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Um, it has the ramps, it has everything.

1428
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
It really is about the best.

1429
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I mean, other than now like on Pinmame or something it really is probably, uh, it was

1430
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
the only good version of this game you could get at home apart from owning the table.

1431
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
And, um, I mean I'll sit and play this sometimes too.

1432
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And one good thing about this too is that, um, it actually has, um, some of the synthesized

1433
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
speech from the game.

1434
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Um, although it pauses the game to play the speech.

1435
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
It has most of the music, the sound effects.

1436
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
You can turn them on and off.

1437
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Um, your pause is on your second controller.

1438
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
The first, um, can't because you use start and select as your nudge.

1439
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
You know, make sure you don't tilt.

1440
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Um, a lot of people really, really liked it because it is a faithful rendition.

1441
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But there are people who did not like the enemies and hazards on the play field as they

1442
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
were not in the original.

1443
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,000
They did, um, Rare reused the game engine to do high speed which was also based off

1444
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
of, uh, Steve Ritchie's High Speed.

1445
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Um, but it was published by, uh, Trade West.

1446
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
But it used Rare's engine.

1447
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
By the way, Steve Ritchie is a really cool guy.

1448
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
He did the voices for Black Knight.

1449
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
For, um, for, uh, No Fear.

1450
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
And, uh, he's just a really cool dude.

1451
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I want to do voices on a pinball game.

1452
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Be fun.

1453
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Yeah.

1454
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Stop shaking the table.

1455
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Rob's game would be called Girl, Please.

1456
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Bitch, please.

1457
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Yeah.

1458
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
But anyway, as far as other, um, pinball games that came out on the, uh, NES, there

1459
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
was pinball, rollerball, rock and ball, and pinball quest.

1460
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Uh, I really think that pinbot is the brightest on the list.

1461
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Pinball quest is one of those games you kind of remember through rose colored glasses.

1462
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Like, oh man, pinball quest was awesome.

1463
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And then you go back and play it and you're like, God, it was, it had so many bugs and

1464
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
issues though.

1465
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It was not good.

1466
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Pinbot is just solid.

1467
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
It was a testament, I think, to, to rares, you know, early rare games.

1468
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Rollerball wasn't bad.

1469
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Rollerball wasn't bad at all.

1470
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Uh, you forgot the, the actual game called pinball from, uh, Nintendo.

1471
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Yeah, there was pinball.

1472
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
But I still think that pinbot is the best of the bunch.

1473
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Yeah.

1474
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Oh yeah, I agree.

1475
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
You know, rollerball was also, uh, I thought there was one other I'm not thinking of.

1476
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I'll tell you what's funny.

1477
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
The actual table for rollerball was the one that I, the first game I played when I got

1478
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
to the expo.

1479
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Oh.

1480
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Yeah.

1481
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I didn't know it was a real table.

1482
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Yeah.

1483
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
It's like, um.

1484
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Was it like four screens tall or something?

1485
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
No.

1486
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Oh, maybe I'm thinking of a different game.

1487
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Or maybe it was roller games.

1488
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Roller games is one of them.

1489
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Yeah, I think you're, I think you're blending those.

1490
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Because I think rollerball on NES was like a four screen tall table.

1491
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Yeah, it was.

1492
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I was thinking of roller games.

1493
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Sorry.

1494
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Um, you know which one I always wish would get, uh, would have had a release like that?

1495
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
It was hyperball.

1496
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
The one where you have, like, the major multi balls and that's all you do is shoot, like,

1497
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
pinballs all day and all night until you hit these little side targets.

1498
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Rollerball would have, uh, uh, hyperball would have been fun.

1499
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I think.

1500
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
But digress.

1501
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Pinbot.

1502
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Classic.

1503
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
It's, you can't go wrong with Pinbot.

1504
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Alright.

1505
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,000
And if you have, anyone ever thinks to get a classic table, Pinbot makes a great start

1506
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
and it makes really good for trading up later.

1507
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Alright, there it is.

1508
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Your classic game of the week.

1509
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Pinbot for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1510
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
One of my favorites.

1511
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
A non-Sega game.

1512
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Oh, my stars and daughters.

1513
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
You know what?

1514
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I do non-Sega games all the time.

1515
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I've done compile.

1516
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Non-Sega slash non-tomographic.

1517
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Non-tomographic game.

1518
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I've done Irem.

1519
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Alright, no, it was good times.

1520
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Uh, some folks in chat reminiscing about some of the portable pinball games that were really

1521
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
good.

1522
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Uh, Fifth Dream says Pokemon Pinball owned.

1523
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Uh, Black Wolf says I enjoyed Metroid Prime Pinball in the DS.

1524
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Yeah, both were really good.

1525
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
What was the game that was on the old, the original Game Boy?

1526
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Was it Revenge of the Gator?

1527
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Revenge of the Gator.

1528
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
That one was fun.

1529
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Yeah, that was great.

1530
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Revenge of the Gator was great.

1531
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I would stay up all night playing that damn game.

1532
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I remember playing that in seventh grade.

1533
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Were you a Revenge of the Gator fan, Bradley?

1534
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
No, I was thinking about something even earlier.

1535
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Oh, your mic cut out.

1536
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I don't know why.

1537
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Let me, yeah, just uh.

1538
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Oh yeah, it came off the end there.

1539
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Okay, I was thinking something even earlier than these games.

1540
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It was a, I don't know if it was based on any real pinball table, but there was a pinball

1541
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
on, uh, on the Atari 2600, uh, like Midnight Magic or something like that.

1542
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Yeah.

1543
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I don't remember.

1544
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Atari had one of their own too.

1545
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Yeah, it was like a really basic sort of thing.

1546
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:35,000
One of my favorite Commodore 64 games ever was Pinball Construction Set by ECA.

1547
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
That's what EA used to be back in the day was ECA.

1548
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Pinball Construction Set was awesome.

1549
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Like you, it was literally build your own damn pinball table, but people would, you

1550
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
know, uh, there was no internet really back then, but you could find, you would disc trade

1551
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
with people and get their pinball tables and yeah, you could find some pretty epic stuff

1552
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
out there.

1553
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Amazing.

1554
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
So, uh, lots of props for Revenge of the Gator in our chat room.

1555
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Black Wolf says I loved it.

1556
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Rama says Revenge of the Gator was godly.

1557
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I knew Black Wolf would remember Pinball Construction Set.

1558
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I knew he would.

1559
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I knew he would.

1560
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
There you go.

1561
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Good times.

1562
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Hmm.

1563
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,000
You know, I was actually just thinking that it would be cool if, you know, cause you know,

1564
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
like, uh, there's actually a pinball table for Rollercoaster Tycoon.

1565
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Um, it would be cool if they did like sim pin now, you know, where it's, you build your

1566
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:29,000
pinball tables and then put them out on, um, on, uh, like, uh, some, you know, something

1567
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
like steam, you know, you put your, you have the crater and you put your tables up for

1568
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
other people to download and compare and rate.

1569
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Or how about just freaking pinball construction set, but like, you know.

1570
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
And I think that the game you were thinking of was called, uh, David's Midnight Magic,

1571
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
wasn't it?

1572
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,000
No, there was a midnight magic for Atari 2600, but there was also a David's Midnight Magic.

1573
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
See, here's the pinball construction set.

1574
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Let me see if there's actually music or if somebody talking in this clip here on YouTube,

1575
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
but yeah, you can see that they're putting together their little pinball table and they

1576
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
put a little ramps and all the stuff you use to build it.

1577
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
So they're on the side and then if we actually see like a finished table here, it was David's

1578
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Midnight Magic.

1579
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
There's also a Commodore 64 version, Rob.

1580
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Nice.

1581
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
And, uh, it was on the Atari computers and the Atari 800.

1582
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I'm sorry.

1583
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
The Atari 2600 version was just called Midnight Magic.

1584
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Hmm.

1585
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Very cool.

1586
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
All right.

1587
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Uh, that's going to do it for this part a of Orange Lawn Tradio, but don't go anywhere.

1588
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
We've got more of Orange Lawn Tradio to come after the break.

1589
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Oh my God.

1590
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Crewball.

1591
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
That was awful.

1592
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Crewball, apparently.

1593
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Uh, the mailbag, the Fugu Question of the Week, your phone calls, and some more stories,

1594
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
including, yes, we're going to talk about that little controversy that went down between

1595
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Nintendo and Evo and, uh, speaking of Nintendo, a possible new franchise for them next year.

1596
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,000
We'll talk all about that when we come back with more of Orange Lawn Tradio right after this.

1597
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Hi there.

1598
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
My name is Elliot B, and you're participating with Orange Lawn Tradio, the show where every

1599
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
gamer has a voice, and I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is

1600
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.

1601
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It has musical apes fighting reptilian pirates.

1602
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
What more could you ask for?

1603
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Boobs.

1604
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Welcome back to Orange Lawn Tradio, live with episode number 512, July the 14th of 2013.

1605
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Big thanks to Elliot there for the bumper, even though that's the second time you all

1606
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
have heard it, because I don't have any new bumpers to play, so I think you guys need

1607
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
to fix that.

1608
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
For more information about sending a bumper to Orange Lawn Tradio, check out vognetwork.com

1609
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
and the forums has all the information there in Orange Lawn Tradio.

1610
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Everything you need to know there.

1611
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Uh, I'm playing the, um, new Find Me games during the break because I streetpassed with

1612
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Bradley, who's sitting here in studio tonight, and I also streetpassed with Dark Sakura.

1613
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Now, one thing I noticed about this Warriors Way, which I'm still trying to figure this

1614
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,000
game out, it's basically like you have troops, and the troops number is based on the number

1615
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
of people you've had ever in your plaza.

1616
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Now, I streetpassed with a friend of mine that does some of the shadowcasting for movies

1617
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:14,000
here locally, and he's like, dude, Rob, like, you gave me 700 people for my army in Warriors

1618
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Way, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, I've been to E3 and all this stuff.

1619
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
You know, I've picked up quite a few people, and he's like, you helped me beat a level,

1620
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
and I'm like, cool.

1621
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
So I'm like, alright, I'm awesome, I have a big army.

1622
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Well, I just streetpassed here with Brad, who came into Warriors Way.

1623
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
25,000 people?!

1624
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
You've streetpassed with 25,000 people?!

1625
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,000
That isn't, actually, that isn't the right, that's because, that's like the monarch,

1626
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
that's what the person who's actually played the game,

1627
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Yeah.

1628
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
come as a monarch.

1629
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Oh, wait, wait, you're not, okay, sorry, we're not hearing you for some reason.

1630
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
No, it's my fault, I didn't mute you.

1631
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Sorry, Bradley.

1632
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Okay, so that's not exactly how many I've streetpassed.

1633
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I actually have a thousand, like, a little over a thousand streetpasses.

1634
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Still, that's a lot.

1635
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
But the army is 25,000 because, as you play the game, you get more people into your army,

1636
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
and then, and it'll show you the actual force.

1637
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I think it's, you come in as a monarch if you've actually been playing the game,

1638
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Yeah.

1639
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,000
and then that's when you'll see something more than, like, a few hundred to a thousand.

1640
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Uh-huh.

1641
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Okay.

1642
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
25,000, showing what my actual armory is right now.

1643
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:21,000
But, your people weren't like, oh, I'm gonna join up, you tried to attack me or something,

1644
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I'm like, rude!

1645
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Yeah, so that's what happens if a monarch comes in, you have to,

1646
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Ugh.

1647
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
you have to either let them go in peacefully or attack them.

1648
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Assert them.

1649
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Well,

1650
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Basically, crush your army.

1651
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I did not get 25,000 troops from Bradley, but I did get, like, 50 from Dark Sakura,

1652
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
so that helped me.

1653
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That'll, that'll help a little bit.

1654
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
What?

1655
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
There we go.

1656
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Alright, um, moving on, we're going to get back into some gaming news here, starting

1657
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
off with Loki.

1658
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Yes.

1659
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, um, Crazy Taxi.

1660
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
That's right.

1661
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Crazy Taxi.

1662
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Are we gonna make some crazy money?

1663
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Possibly.

1664
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And, Crazy Taxi has come to Android, and, um, yeah, it's out for, uh, five bucks.

1665
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
It's basically like the, uh, IOS port.

1666
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
They've got, uh, the two modes, original and arcade.

1667
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And I think some of the music's back, too, so, um, that's good.

1668
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I mean, I'm sure they don't have Pizza Hut and all that stuff in there, but, um, still

1669
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
fun.

1670
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
And I think it does support some controllers, so the first thing I'm gonna do with this

1671
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
game is I'm gonna sideload it onto the Ouya to see if it works, so that's gonna be, uh,

1672
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
mission number one, I guess.

1673
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Um, new Ratchet and Clank game was, uh, revealed this week into the Nexus.

1674
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:46,000
That's gonna be, um, coming out at some undetermined point, I guess, holiday, uh, for thirty bucks,

1675
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
and, um, on PlayStation 3.

1676
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
So, look for it then.

1677
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:58,000
And, uh, last but not least, uh, we have some more details about the PlayStation Plus version

1678
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
of Drive Club.

1679
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Obviously, it will be missing a few things.

1680
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It's basically the exact same version as the full version, except it's missing a few

1681
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,000
assets, such as, um, some of the cars or tracks that will be found in the full version.

1682
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Um, I guess the PlayStation Plus edition, I guess, will feature online multiplayer and

1683
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
the single-player campaign, as well as some of the challenges.

1684
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Uh, you will be able to purchase missing content.

1685
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
But press the R2 button to upgrade to the full version of Drive Club now.

1686
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I think it's not gonna be as expensive as buying the full version of Drive Club, but

1687
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
still, I mean, if you wanna check it out, that's kind of a cool thing.

1688
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
And you don't have to buy the full version of it.

1689
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I mean, like, for example, if someone like me just wants to play it, like, on a VoG gaming

1690
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
night or something like that, I don't need to buy the full version.

1691
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
You know, I can just play it as is.

1692
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
So, it'll be cool to check out.

1693
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Yeah, I mean, I wasn't expecting...

1694
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
To get a release game on the system's release for free, I mean, usually the PS Plus games

1695
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
aren't, like, new stuff.

1696
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Like, it's usually a year old.

1697
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
So, I'm not totally surprised by this, that it's basically a glorified demo.

1698
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
But it sounds like it'll at least have, like, some multiplayer.

1699
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
So, it'll give you a little something.

1700
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I mean, this is what we get now instead of a pack-in game, right?

1701
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
A free download coupon.

1702
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Technically, you get a pack-in thing, but it's, you know, only if you have the camera.

1703
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, the cam...

1704
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1705
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I don't have the camera, so I guess I'm screwed.

1706
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Because I was lucky enough to order a PlayStation 4 early, and I don't plan on changing that.

1707
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Anyway, moving on to other news.

1708
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Capcom had some layoffs this week.

1709
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
That's always a bit disappointing.

1710
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,000
One of the people affected, Christian Svensson, which is the Senior VP, excuse me,

1711
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
of Planning and Business Development.

1712
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
He apparently is departing the company.

1713
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Capcom said in a statement,

1714
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Capcom today laid off several employees from the US office as part of an overall organizational restructure of the company.

1715
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:58,000
The transition to new generation of hardware and changing industry landscape have required us to adapt our business to best meet our new goals.

1716
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
We sincerely thank each individual for their contributions and wish them well.

1717
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Well, this is never fun news to report.

1718
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Trying to kind of figure out the why behind this, though.

1719
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Is this because maybe expectations of Lost Planet 3 and so forth are kind of low?

1720
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
It's because there's no more Mega Man?

1721
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
It's all Mega Man's fault.

1722
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
It's all Mega Man's fault.

1723
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
All Mega Man.

1724
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
It's all Mega Man's fault.

1725
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
If they did Mega Man Legends 3, they wouldn't have this problem.

1726
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Now, now, no need to kick them while they're down.

1727
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Alright, Reggie Fils-Aime in a video on YouTube mentioned that Nintendo fans can pick up Pikmin 3 early at certain video game retailers.

1728
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:40,000
July 20th and 21st, you can actually do like a hands-on demo at over 250 GameStop and EB Games locations.

1729
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
They still have EB Games up and running different places?

1730
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
A foreign company.

1731
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Oh, in Canada.

1732
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Yeah.

1733
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
So the US and Canada will have Pikmin 3 experiences or whatever.

1734
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:58,000
If you pre-order the downloadable version of the game at any GameStop store on either of those two days.

1735
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
So you have to go get a download code at GameStop on one of those two days.

1736
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
You will be able to get the full game one whole day early on August 3rd.

1737
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Or you can go to Kmart.

1738
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Who breaks street dates.

1739
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Or Toys R Us.

1740
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Or apparently Walmart is the new street date breaker because you know you can get them Twinkies at Walmart.

1741
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Yeah.

1742
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
It's rogue Twinkies in the Walmart aisles.

1743
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Or just wait a day. It's Pikmin. It's not fucking Grand Theft Auto 5 or something.

1744
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Right?

1745
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I mean, that's what you got, you know, that...

1746
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I mean, think of the deal with the devil that you're making here.

1747
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I mean, you're like buying a digital download code at retail to play it one day early.

1748
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
And they will make you sign a pact at GameStop that you will have to sign with blood.

1749
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Hey, let's give us your email. Hey, why don't you send it for the card, you know, so that we can...

1750
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Hey, you want to get our magazine?

1751
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
You got Pikmin 2 to trade in?

1752
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Tristan told their magazine is actually pretty decent.

1753
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
You got any other Wii U games you want to trade in?

1754
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Oh yeah, there aren't any Wii U games out there to trade in.

1755
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
There are. They're just not worth anything.

1756
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Well, remember Nintendo's philosophy is make games that people want to keep.

1757
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
To be fair, like the games I own, I don't want to trade in.

1758
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Maybe the Sonic Racing game. I guess that wasn't that great.

1759
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
But I still like it enough.

1760
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Nothing is ever as good as Sonic R.

1761
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Alright.

1762
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Also, one more story about Super Street Fighter IV.

1763
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Apparently still going with updates.

1764
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:37,000
There was a panel at Evo announcing Hyper Street Fighter IV with five new characters.

1765
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Four of them have been named.

1766
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Alina, Poison, Rolento, and Hugo.

1767
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Rolento!

1768
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Which are all based off of the fact that they were in Street Fighter X Tekken.

1769
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
So I'm guessing that they'll be easy enough to bring over.

1770
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
So those are the only four confirmed characters at the moment.

1771
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
No word about the mystery fifth character.

1772
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Although not... It doesn't sound like it's Alex.

1773
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Alina's a fun one.

1774
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I guess there was a rumor going around that it was Alex, but it doesn't appear to be Alex.

1775
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
So, um, interesting.

1776
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
What is this all about here? $15 for the download.

1777
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Don't know what the date will be, but there will also be a disc-based version, which I'm assuming is everything, for $40.

1778
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Early 2014 is the tentative release.

1779
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,000
You know, I'd like to see some of the EX characters make it into the new Street Fighter IV stuff.

1780
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
It's pretty cool that this game is still going.

1781
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I mean, thanks to updates and DLC and all that.

1782
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
You're shaking your head over there. You're a hater, Loki.

1783
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
How many times have they re-released this game?

1784
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I mean, seriously, they've had...

1785
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
How many times have they re-released Street Fighter II?

1786
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I understand that, but they had Street Fighter, Super Street, or they had Street Fighter IV.

1787
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Then they had Super Street Fighter IV.

1788
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition.

1789
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I'm talking all disc-based releases.

1790
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
And now they're gonna have hyper Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition?

1791
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
No.

1792
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You draw the lines.

1793
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Stop buying that game. Seriously.

1794
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
It's done. Just make a new Street Fighter game.

1795
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Give me Capcom vs. SNK III.

1796
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I don't care what evil, satanic pacts have to be formed between those companies to get this to happen,

1797
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
but I want that game.

1798
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Give it to me.

1799
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Alright, moving on. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1800
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Anything? Dark Soccer? Hello?

1801
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I'm waiting for...

1802
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Sonic 4 is going to have its episodes on Ouya.

1803
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:38,000
So I guess if you like crappy Sonic games and crappy systems, then you can play Sonic 4 on Ouya.

1804
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Also though, and this is good news, Sonic CD is going to be out on Ouya,

1805
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
and it better freaking have the Japanese soundtrack.

1806
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
They're just porting the... They're not even porting the game over.

1807
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I mean, it works with controller support already.

1808
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
You can sideload that thing in there.

1809
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Because I have a Sonic CD, I got it with my Moga controller,

1810
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
and I think it's siloed on my Ouya, actually.

1811
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I don't remember if I did that or not, but it works.

1812
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Osega of America saying that it's going to be soon.

1813
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
That same soon that we always refer to.

1814
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Also, fans of Skullgirls can be happy that it's coming on PC on August 22nd.

1815
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Being put out by Lab Zero Games, and I know a lot of people are totally into Skullgirls.

1816
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
They're also working on five new characters as DLC,

1817
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
which is coming directly from their Indiegogo campaign.

1818
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
They've actually exceeded their $150,000 goal.

1819
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
They've made $828,768.

1820
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
So, yay more Skullgirls.

1821
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:50,000
And then, this one, I'm actually going to relink this one because it's on Capcom Unity.

1822
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But I wanted to talk about it.

1823
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:59,000
The PS3 art for DuckTales Remastered, the box art, has been released,

1824
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
and it's looking pretty darn good.

1825
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
And I'm really looking forward to this.

1826
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
There's also a link on here to the documentaries,

1827
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
which talks about the game itself and the development.

1828
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
So, I'm going to go ahead and actually relink this one in the chat room.

1829
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
And if any people who are listening to the podcast want to look forward,

1830
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
just go to Capcom Unity and look through their blog.

1831
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Yeah, they're actually going to do a physical retail release with pins in it.

1832
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Nice.

1833
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Yeah, I heard about that. It's a week later, though, which sucks.

1834
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
But, it might still be worth it.

1835
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Rob, life is like a hurricane.

1836
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
It blows?

1837
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
No.

1838
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
What?

1839
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
The song? The theme song?

1840
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Rock you like a hurricane.

1841
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
DuckTales, Rob, theme song.

1842
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I get it, I get it, I get it.

1843
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Just a little slow.

1844
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Geez, Rob.

1845
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
By the way, though, I listened to the Japanese theme song for DuckTales.

1846
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
It's kind of interesting.

1847
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
It's a song by a lady.

1848
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Oh, time for the Fugu Question of the Week, right?

1849
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I didn't realize that was our last story.

1850
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
G-Rob, you know, you got on me for being quiet, always pulling up everything.

1851
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
And now you're doing it, too.

1852
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I was playing Mii Plaza games, it was very important.

1853
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Hot kettle, pot pot kettle.

1854
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Very, very important.

1855
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
My butt.

1856
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Let's see.

1857
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Looking at chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1858
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Apparently, BlackWolf made a Vine of me playing Pimbot Ness, me meaning him,

1859
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
while listening to OLR, but Vine decides not to accept the upload.

1860
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I guess this is why everybody ran away to Instagram.

1861
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Sad.

1862
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Have you guys played with the Instagram video at all?

1863
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
No.

1864
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
No.

1865
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Rob, Instagram is like, so three months ago, I swear.

1866
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Oh, Hipstagram.

1867
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Alright, here, I had to hear this.

1868
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I need to use a top-level digital camera out of irony.

1869
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Amazing.

1870
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Still catchy.

1871
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Some things transcend language barriers, and a catchy melody is one of those things.

1872
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

1873
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Maybe this little theme song here is a catchy melody for some of you out there.

1874
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
It's my vehicle.

1875
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Every week, we go to our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities and ask a question,

1876
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
and we read some of our favorite answers here live on air.

1877
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Or if we have enough time, which I guess we probably do tonight with the answers we were given,

1878
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
we will read all the answers.

1879
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:01,000
So this weekend, Dark Sakura and Bradley attended California Extreme,

1880
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:06,000
which is a classic arcade game show in the Bay Area that is a celebration of pinball machines and classic game machines.

1881
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Is there a classic arcade or pinball machine that you've never played that you've always wanted to try?

1882
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,000
If you can't think of one, is there one you remember from a long time ago that you really want to play again?

1883
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
So we wanted to show some love to classic games in this week's FUGL question.

1884
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Retertainment says, there's what I call a classic arcade game that I've played that I'd like to play again, The Act.

1885
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:35,000
This is an extremely rare arcade game that, according to Wikipedia, only one arcade has a working stand-up arcade copy of it.

1886
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,000
It just so happens the one arcade with a stand-up copy of The Act is located near me.

1887
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
It looks like I have something to do on Monday.

1888
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
What is The Act? I don't even know that one.

1889
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
The Act is a game. It's all hand-drawn animation.

1890
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
It's basically about this guy who's in love with some girl.

1891
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:59,000
It kind of, like, think of it as almost like a Dragon's Lair type game, but it's not really like that.

1892
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:05,000
They built it for, like, iOS and Android and stuff, and it has a lot of contextual sensitive stuff in there.

1893
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,000
But it looks pretty cool. It's all, you know, gorgeous and looks like it has a good story.

1894
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Let's see, Rababa responds on Google Plus and says, I've always wanted to try Hyperball, the ball-bearing gun rapid-fire pinball.

1895
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Jamie probably has, and I'm curious as to the general object of that game. Spell things? Shoot them faster than they drain?

1896
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I talked about it earlier. I just like shooting them really fast, just because it's fun.

1897
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:37,000
And there's so many, it's like you can play with so many balls. You can paddle balls all day.

1898
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
You just took all those balls all at once, didn't you guys?

1899
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And I beat them. I beat those balls with flippers.

1900
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
With your flipper?

1901
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
With my flippers.

1902
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
That game is fucking loud, by the way.

1903
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Going to Facebook, which, by the way, I just want to point out over on Facebook right now,

1904
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:05,000
we have 572 people that like us on Facebook, which is a nice, admirable number, but we're 572.

1905
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,000
We need one more like, and then there'll be a huge Bamani and joke there.

1906
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Come on, people. One more like on Facebook. Somebody give it to us.

1907
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:19,000
30K replied and said, Simpsons Pinball. There were actually two Simpsons Pinball machines with her.

1908
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Was it Simpsons Pinball Party, are you thinking?

1909
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
There's an old one and a newer one, isn't there?

1910
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Simpsons Pinball Party we used to have at my house.

1911
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Yeah.

1912
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
It's a pretty fun table.

1913
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Andy R. said, I was a bit young during the arcade boom, so I don't remember,

1914
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:37,000
but if I can expand to non-classic arcade games, I really want to play ju-beat or, u-beat,

1915
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I always say that wrong, excuse me, u-beat or reflect-beat in an arcade.

1916
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I love rhythm games like Technica and I feel these games would be a lot more fun in the arcade than their iPad equivalents.

1917
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
You'd be right.

1918
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Sadly, I no longer live near Round 1 or Sunnyvale Golf Land, so I guess I'll have to settle for the iPad.

1919
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Xtafer replied and said, Growing up, I loved plating side-scrolling games, I think he meant playing,

1920
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
side-scrolling games in the arcade like Shinobi or Strider.

1921
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I also have fond memories of Golden Axe and Super Mario Brothers.

1922
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Which, actually that reminds me of something, Rob.

1923
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
You know what game they also had there, speaking of side-scrolling?

1924
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Willow.

1925
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Oh.

1926
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
That Willow arcade.

1927
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Amazing.

1928
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Sorry for the Facebook noises, they're not disabled on this computer and frickin' people are setting it off on purpose.

1929
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Alright, Thomas B. replies and says, Have you ever heard of the pinball machine Hercules?

1930
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Yes.

1931
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I believe it used 4-inch balls.

1932
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,000
The machine was very large, I only played it a few times, but it was always fun to play.

1933
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Do you like big balls, Dark Soccer?

1934
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And I cannot lie.

1935
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
It used a cue ball.

1936
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Oh, like in pool?

1937
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yeah.

1938
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And they had one at the last classic gaming expo I went to, it was at California Extreme

1939
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
two years ago, they also had that dressed up Captain Fantastic 2.

1940
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:55,000
The big Elden John platform boots from Tommy.

1941
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:00,000
But Hercules is actually, I'm short, I have a hard time playing that game because I can't

1942
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
really...

1943
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
You can't reach the balls?

1944
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
No, I have to, it's like as wide out as my arms go.

1945
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
It's like my wingspan, and hitting the flippers is difficult.

1946
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
And it moves slowly.

1947
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Dark Tetsuya says, There was one I played years ago in Santa Cruz that I'd love to chance

1948
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
to play again, Namco's Galaxian III.

1949
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Imagine a gigantic booth with six seats, two 50-inch monitors with a separate laser displayer

1950
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
for each one, and six Star Wars-style flight controllers.

1951
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
You fly along in your gunship, shooting at aliens as they fly in formation, while occasionally

1952
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
dealing with a gigantic alien boss.

1953
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
And it's up to you and your teammates to take them down before they deplete your ship's

1954
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
life meter to zero.

1955
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Suffice to say, it's pretty epic.

1956
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Do you want to know something depressing?

1957
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:48,000
At our Roseville Dave and Busters, right by the redemption area, there is this booth

1958
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
for a different game, but that booth was once a Galaxian III booth.

1959
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
It even has some of the decorating elements on it.

1960
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
That used to be a Galaxian III.

1961
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Let's see.

1962
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Will M. replied and said, An arcade game I've never played and would love to.

1963
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Difficult to answer as I've played a massive amount due to traveling around, but I can

1964
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
name one I'd love to play again.

1965
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
The Ninja Warriors.

1966
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
That widescreen was oh so damn awesome.

1967
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Chiggers says, I remember playing The Kiss Table when I was a kid.

1968
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I loved it.

1969
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Ragenator said, I never had the opportunity to play the arcade version of Killer Instinct,

1970
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
which I regret.

1971
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,000
In terms of stuff I want to play again, it's Samurai Shodown IV, Amakusa's Revenge.

1972
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Hitstun says, I want to play Data East's 1990 side-scrolling beat-em-up masterpiece,

1973
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Trio the Punch, Never Forget Me.

1974
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
What it lacks in graphical power, responsive controls, or music changes, it makes up for

1975
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
in being batshit insane.

1976
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Enemies include a giant bronze foot that stomps you, enemies that plant bombs that self-destruct

1977
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:54,000
in fear of those same bombs, a giant statue of Karnov carried by four smaller Karnovs,

1978
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,000
and Colonel Sanders with a head that explodes to reveal a purple bird that froze fried chicken

1979
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
at you.

1980
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
What?

1981
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Sounds a lot like Proteus.

1982
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
The game's only console release is a Japanese PlayStation 2 exclusive.

1983
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
He could have made that up and I'd never know the difference.

1984
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Codeman replied and said, I know this sounds like a generic answer, but I've always wanted

1985
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
to play the Tron arcade game.

1986
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Which one?

1987
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
That's true, there was Tron and Discs of Tron.

1988
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
They had actually Tron and Discs of Tron next to each other.

1989
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Codeman, more reason for you to go to Disneyland, just saying.

1990
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,000
And I know you have a little girl who soon will be old enough to appreciate Disneyland,

1991
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
just saying.

1992
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
If you take a child to Disneyland before they're five years old, they get him free.

1993
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
There you go.

1994
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
And a game called Time Pilot.

1995
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Time Pilot's fun.

1996
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
That is, for what it's worth, that's on Xbox Live Arcade, and it plays pretty decently

1997
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
with a 360 analog stick, just for what it's worth.

1998
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And it was in Game Room.

1999
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:52,000
And lastly, Kane I Am says, not that I ever played it, but I really want the Elvira Mistress

2000
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
of the Darkness table for my house, because boobies.

2001
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Excellent answer.

2002
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
That is a great table too.

2003
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Which one, the Elvira Mistress or the Scared Stiff?

2004
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Elvira Mistress of the Dark.

2005
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Scared Stiff I think is a better table.

2006
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Okay, so I know you saw this, Dark Sakura, because Alan and I went out to a bar in San

2007
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Francisco after the Frank music concert on the 4th of July, or the night before the 4th

2008
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
of July.

2009
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
We went out in San Francisco, we went to this bar in the Castro called Moby Dick, and they

2010
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
had pinball machines there.

2011
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:29,000
And, like, literally, it was like Dark Sakura and Alan Alchemy, Pinball Paradise, because

2012
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,000
they had a World Cup Soccer 94, and they had Elvira Scared Stiff.

2013
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Okay, I need to go there.

2014
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Yeah.

2015
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
First of all-

2016
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
And gays, and booze, and a pool table.

2017
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Like, five of my favorite things together.

2018
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
That actually is like college for me.

2019
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Well, keep in mind, I worked in a pool hall.

2020
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I'm very certain that my boss, even though he was a major dick, was also, he did set

2021
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
off the Gator a bit.

2022
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And, of course, there were also the three other guys that I used to hang out with.

2023
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Anyway, anyway, I've been a hag all my life, Rob, what are you talking about?

2024
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
It's fine.

2025
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
So, and then we had the World Cup Soccer there.

2026
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Across the street, at Solomon's, they had the Mistress of the Dark.

2027
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
But did your pool hall let people play free if they weren't wearing pants?

2028
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Because this place did.

2029
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
No, usually, if they weren't wearing pants, well, I don't know, I could wear a skirt,

2030
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
then I wouldn't be wearing pants.

2031
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
What if a guy comes in in a Utila kilt?

2032
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Does that count?

2033
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I didn't question the system, because nobody wants to see me up there playing it, so.

2034
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
You know what, you should just have, like, sequined boxers.

2035
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And wear those.

2036
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
How do you know I don't?

2037
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Alan, does Rob have sequined boxers?

2038
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
The 1970s, you know, basketball shorts.

2039
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Like the ones that are, like, up to here.

2040
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
They have, like, the teeny slit on the side.

2041
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Like your ass literally hangs out of them, yeah.

2042
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
You need to go in Columbia shorts.

2043
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
That's not sexy at all.

2044
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
None of this is sexy.

2045
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Columbia shorts.

2046
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
None of this is sexy.

2047
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Columbia shorts.

2048
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Alright.

2049
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
That was all our answers.

2050
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Thank you guys at Facebook and Google Plus for answering the question.

2051
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Really appreciate it.

2052
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
If you didn't get your question, or your answer read this week, sorry.

2053
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
But try sending an email.

2054
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

2055
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Let me quickly open that up to folks here in studio.

2056
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Is there an elusive game you haven't been able to play, or maybe something you played once long ago you're dying to play again?

2057
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Bradley?

2058
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I was thinking of, it was, when I played it a long time ago,

2059
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Galaxy Force 2, the actual arcade game that actually had a full rotating seat, or sit-down cabinet where you basically...

2060
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Sumo.

2061
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Yeah, but full rotating.

2062
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Like, could you actually go upside down and stuff?

2063
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Well, full rotating, 103.

2064
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Oh, yeah, 360.

2065
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2066
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I get it.

2067
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
You're not rotating upside down.

2068
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
You're just going left and right.

2069
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
But that was pretty cool.

2070
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
And then, like, the home version that was on the Saturn didn't really do it justice, I think.

2071
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Or maybe it was just a really janky game I didn't know until later.

2072
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Loki?

2073
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Well, I would have said the Galaxian 3, but someone already said that.

2074
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I would be willing to try the Silent Hill arcade game, because I still haven't played that, and I know that was something that they made a while ago.

2075
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
So the Silent Hill arcade game would be fun.

2076
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:21,000
And although it's not really an arcade game, I'd love to go back and play Battletech again as part of Virtual World.

2077
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Did Alan just text you?

2078
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Yes, he did, and he said no.

2079
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Alan!

2080
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Jamie, is there something that's been eluding you?

2081
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I would like to play a radiant silver gun again, because I've played an arcade version of that, and I loved Gun Survivor 2.

2082
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I think what I would actually like to play again as far as tables that I haven't seen in a little while is a black rose.

2083
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
And I've been trying to get Dan to get us one.

2084
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I would love to have a black rose.

2085
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Because you shoot a cannon, and you're a pirate wench.

2086
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
That's the best.

2087
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I honestly can't think of any games that I've never been able to play that I legit haven't played.

2088
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I just miss old arcades. That's what I want more than anything. I want an old school arcade again.

2089
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I guess my answer would be, I would really like to play F-Zero AX again in one of the sit-down cabinets.

2090
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
That shit was pretty amazing, and I missed that an awful lot.

2091
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
And we're not talking just the regular sit-down cabinets, we're talking the ones that rotate.

2092
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:27,000
The ones that will almost flip you upside down, just shy of that. I missed that. That was epic.

2093
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,000
So I would say maybe, yeah, I guess that's my answer. F-Zero AX. I'd like to play that again.

2094
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:38,000
There was a pinball table that I hadn't played in a long time that I actually got to see at California Extreme the last two years.

2095
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:43,000
A pinball table called Genie, which actually my dad had when I was young.

2096
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
I think I know that one.

2097
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:51,000
And sadly this year, one of the flippers or something was weak or broken. It worked, but not very well.

2098
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:58,000
It was working a lot better last year. It was kind of a blast from the past because he sold it 20 years ago.

2099
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Let's see, Koopa Kid Jeremy is in our chat room saying about old arcades, I'm assuming.

2100
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I miss the smell. Not really. This was probably before. When I was a kid, California hadn't banned smoking pretty much everywhere yet.

2101
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,000
So I seem to remember Sam's Town up Highway 50. Remember that place? It was so awesome.

2102
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I remember that place smelling like cheap pizza and cigarettes. That's what old arcades smelled like.

2103
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And Chuck E. Cheese. Well, Chuck E. Cheese didn't smell like cigarettes. They did ban smoking in there, I think, because kids.

2104
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:35,000
But cheap pizza for sure at Chuck E. Cheese. Anyhow, let's see.

2105
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Code Man says, tell me about it. I don't even want to know what an arcade is anymore.

2106
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Well, God, I think there's somebody legit said in their answer, you know, I think I was kind of born after arcades were really a thing.

2107
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:51,000
And that just made me like I had a sad for a minute. You know what? I'm going to offer up a description.

2108
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:59,000
This was the Aladdin's castle in Mobile, Alabama. The day I went after my little brother had gotten hit by a car.

2109
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Oh, my. He was six. He's 30 now. No. Twenty seven right now.

2110
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:12,000
So that, you know, dates it. The walls were half carpeted the same way they had been since the 70s.

2111
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:17,000
This is yeah, this has to be like 1992, something like that. Ninety one.

2112
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:24,000
The walls had brown carpet up to the side like a roller rink does. Old wallpaper.

2113
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Posters of games from the 80s. And the first thing that you saw when you walked in was a samurai showdown to on the 44 inch screen.

2114
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Big ass thing to the left would have been a hockey. I remember perfectly to the left would have been in your hockey table.

2115
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:44,000
As you go back, you see narc. You see a four player Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

2116
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,000
You see a street fighter to a hyper fighting edition.

2117
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:56,000
You see, you know, in the far, far back or your pinballs, your Galaga, your Q.

2118
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Bert, we had a Q. Bert kicks. So you go in.

2119
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:08,000
And the first thing that you hear is, first of all, you sort of smell the same type of smell that comes from Confunk.

2120
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:14,000
You know, sweaty boys playing games, but you hear loud noises and you see bright neon.

2121
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:19,000
And when you leave, if you don't have a headache and your ears aren't ringing a little bit, you haven't been there long enough.

2122
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:26,000
You're doing it wrong. Yeah. Koopa Kid Jeremy, our buddy from the Koopa Club podcast in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

2123
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Chuck E. Cheese smells like pee. I don't remember. They do now. That's for sure.

2124
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I don't remember from when I was a kid, but maybe, you know, everything I remember.

2125
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I have this really early memory. You know, I don't remember a lot from when I was like before.

2126
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Like, you know, you don't remember a lot from before you're like five years old. I don't know about you guys.

2127
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,000
But one thing I do remember is being, I think I was three years old at my sister's wedding,

2128
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
because my sister would have been 19 or 20 at the time because there's a big age difference between us.

2129
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:57,000
And we went to Chuck E. Cheese after one of the rehearsals, I think it was. Not after the wedding.

2130
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,000
She didn't have the reception there. We went after Chuck E. Cheese after one of the rehearsals.

2131
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:07,000
And I remember there was a room. Well, I remember two things. I remember playing Crystal Castles.

2132
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:12,000
And in order to play the game, I had to stand up on one of those little, like, box things that they had for kids.

2133
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:17,000
So I could sit up there and peer over the edge and move that little trackball around so I could move the little bear.

2134
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:22,000
And I remember a room at Chuck E. Cheese that was nothing but a strobe light.

2135
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
And you would, you would dance in front of the strobe light or whatever.

2136
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
And like, it's like 80s technology, like strobe lights, like this new technology.

2137
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Now you can have a strobe light on your fucking phone.

2138
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Did yours have the Dayglo room?

2139
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:40,000
It was black, black lights with drawings on the wall that would glow under the black light.

2140
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:46,000
And at my Chuck E. Cheese, and this is like the old, old ass one that, like, I think burned down.

2141
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Yeah. But there were the hands and feet on the wall right above the door.

2142
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:56,000
And you go through the door and you're in this little room that's Dayglo and then on the other side is the bathroom.

2143
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Wow.

2144
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,000
But we had that too. We had the strobe room too. And then we had the room with the hippo lady.

2145
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Yes. I remember the hippo lady.

2146
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
The party room with hippo lady.

2147
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
All those.

2148
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Henrietta Hippo.

2149
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
They still have all the animatronics. They just, they get scarier as you get older.

2150
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
But anyway.

2151
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Yeah. We had the showbiz pizza at my place.

2152
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Yeah. One of them bought the other. Chuck E. Cheese bought showbiz at one point, right?

2153
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Yeah.

2154
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Yeah.

2155
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Pizza Time Theater.

2156
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Were you from this area? Were you from the Bay Area?

2157
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
No. I'm from South Carolina.

2158
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Oh, that's right. Okay.

2159
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
You know who owned Pizza Time Theater, right?

2160
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Oh, at Nolan Bushnell.

2161
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Yeah.

2162
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Yeah.

2163
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
And then there was Bullwinkles. They had the water show.

2164
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Water sports?

2165
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:36,000
They had a water show. They had a fountain, like, interactive. Like, it would just do this fountain show thing.

2166
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Like, a mid-tier version of what you would see, like, at the Bellagio or something like that.

2167
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Was that, like, the climax of the Great Muppet Caper? Did Miss Piggy come out on the fountain?

2168
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Sort of, I guess.

2169
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,000
So it's Bullwinkles, you know? All the Bullwinkles characters.

2170
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Yeah. I remember the time when I always wanted to go to the mall because that's when they had the arcades there.

2171
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
They had Aladdin's Castle and both of the malls that we had at the time.

2172
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Mm-hmm.

2173
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I was going there all the time.

2174
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
No, no. I don't really want to go to malls at all.

2175
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:05,000
God. When I was a kid, I was so obnoxious because whenever my parents were going on vacation, like, we literally, I was like, I was 10 or something.

2176
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,000
We went to Hawaii. We went to Maui. We went to Hawaii. And I'm like, I want to go to an arcade.

2177
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,000
I want to go to an arcade. I want to go to an arcade. Arcade.

2178
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:18,000
So we went to some mall and, you know, because my mom liked to shop anyway.

2179
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
So we went to the mall and they had an arcade and I got my way.

2180
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I fucking miss malls having arcades.

2181
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Yeah, I know.

2182
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
True. Seriously.

2183
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Well, I miss, and actually, I'd have to say that even though I hated doing parties and stuff,

2184
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:35,000
that was probably the most fun job I've had was working at the arcade.

2185
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Because, like, I could just hang around all day, you know, yeah, I had to, you know, do that, what, dust mop thing that you,

2186
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:48,000
the mop with the motor, the vacuum motor thing that you just push around and go instead of actually a vacuum.

2187
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
And, you know, and walk around and just get to chat games with people.

2188
02:04:52,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I worked at Aladdin's Castle when we had, when Tekken 3 just came out and we had just been purchased by Namco as well.

2189
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
So we had shirts with Pac-Man on it. It was really cool.

2190
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,000
And whatever the cyber station that was all Pac-Man branded themed and everything, that was really cool.

2191
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:13,000
But working at the Aladdin's Castle was just a touch like working in an old 80s style arcade.

2192
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
And I had a good time there.

2193
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I mean, I would come home with a migraine every night, but other than that, I had a great time working there.

2194
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Yeah, good memories about arcades. Good times.

2195
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:33,000
And also that was figuring out the right place to knee the Street Fighter Alpha 2 where I could play for free.

2196
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,000
You know, as far, was that like your first minimum wage job type of thing? Because like my first...

2197
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
No.

2198
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
No?

2199
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:45,000
My first minimum wage job was working for a grocery store, which I probably quit a week later because they scheduled me during my classes.

2200
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Dope.

2201
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,000
I don't actually count that as a for reals job because it was hell.

2202
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
My first minimum wage job was not that bad.

2203
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,000
But my second one was working in the game room at school.

2204
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Oh, okay.

2205
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
And then after that, it was working at a cookie store where I lived on cookies for a year.

2206
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
And then it was the arcade.

2207
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I worked at a place called, they don't exist anymore, it was Placer TV Video, which was a video rental store they used to rent.

2208
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
I know of them.

2209
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Yeah, well, they were still around like in the mid 90s, like when everything was starting to shift to DVD.

2210
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:20,000
And at that time, they were still renting NES games and like videotapes, but they didn't really get on the DVD bandwagon fast enough.

2211
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
And that's kind of what killed them.

2212
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:31,000
But we rented porn, like, because like that's and that's seriously why people would come to Placer TV because there was, you know, Hollywood Video didn't rent that stuff.

2213
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Blockbuster didn't rent that stuff. We had porn.

2214
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:39,000
So that was kind of fun. Like my first minimum wage job, I get to like check out porn to people.

2215
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Did you have the red door?

2216
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
No, it was just on the top shelf.

2217
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:53,000
There was there was no laws prohibiting that stuff. People weren't so freaking like trying to be politically correct and protect everybody back then.

2218
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
It was just kids can't reach that high.

2219
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
My granny taking me to rent videos when I was in Dothan for a summer.

2220
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
And by the way, the arcade we had in Dothan was Tilt.

2221
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Yeah, I remember Tilt.

2222
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:07,000
But she just said, OK, pick whatever movie, make sure it's a good movie.

2223
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:12,000
You know, I'd read Star Wars like fifty seven thousand times and actually return to the Jedi because that was my favorite movie.

2224
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:20,000
And then I once rented this movie that I think the name was in another language, but it was pretty much Tiger Shark.

2225
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
And it was one of those Jaws like movies, except with naked people.

2226
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
And I watched it. I watched the whole movie.

2227
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:33,000
And I'm like, my sister's my sister's with me and she's like, this movie's dirty.

2228
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I'm like, there's so much blood, blood orgy.

2229
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I loved being taken to go rent movies with people who hadn't who wouldn't read labels.

2230
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:48,000
All right. Memory lane, memory lane. And we're not even back into gaming news. Sorry.

2231
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Let's get back into some gaming news, Loki.

2232
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:58,000
All right. So there is a little bit of a controversy with the new Deus Ex game, The Fall, that came out on iOS platforms.

2233
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Apparently the game had a lockout for jailbroken devices.

2234
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Now, I guess the general thought is, well, your device is jailbroken, you're probably stealing the game.

2235
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:16,000
That's not always true. People jailbreak devices to, you know, put their phone on a different carrier or something like that.

2236
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:25,000
So there's that. So people that were legitimately buying the game allegedly were unable to fire the gun in the game.

2237
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Couldn't fire it. Nothing.

2238
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:33,000
That's kind of a I mean, it's like one of the you hear about the clever anti piracy things like, you know, in what?

2239
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Batman, Arkham Asylum, like you couldn't jump far enough to get past certain parts of the game.

2240
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
You know, I and I can applaud for a clever anti piracy thing.

2241
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
But jailbreaking your device isn't piracy.

2242
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
It's legal, actually.

2243
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I thought I thought then they come down and say that was illegal.

2244
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
And I think it's gone back and forth a few times.

2245
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:56,000
It's a mess. But I mean, people jailbreak exactly like you said, just because you jailbreak your device doesn't make you a pirate.

2246
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Yeah. And on top of that, though, you know, there is an app that you can get from the, you know, the homebrew store or whatever.

2247
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
That basically you can patch it so that you can play the game.

2248
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
It basically makes your device look like it's not jailbroken, even though it is.

2249
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Well, what they should have done is they should have put this out there on the piracy sites like the hours before they put it out on the official app store.

2250
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:31,000
That's how you get the pirates is you got to put like the version of the game up on the piracy sites and then kind of like flood the the market, so to speak.

2251
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I mean, it'll get ratted out as a fake soon enough. But by that point, it's already kind of saturated.

2252
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Well, if you know, apparently, you know, people didn't like that. That was the case.

2253
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:46,000
So they're going to patch it out later on. It says we we have not been clear in our communication because they didn't mention anything either.

2254
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,000
That says that this work. They were trying to be discreet about being dicks.

2255
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:55,000
But, you know, they made a huge mistake in that jailbreaking. Your phone doesn't make you a pirate.

2256
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Thanks, Square Enix. So we have not been clear in our communication earlier this week when we launched Deus Ex the fall.

2257
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:07,000
We did not clearly say that the game world would not support or the game would not support jailbroken devices.

2258
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:14,000
And we'll be switching this off via an update so that all support IS devices will be able to play the game in the near future.

2259
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,000
So although at that point, nobody will want to anymore. Well, maybe the people that bought it.

2260
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:30,000
All right. There was quite a bit of controversy this week and finally came to a head this weekend with the Evo tournament that's going on right now.

2261
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,000
And where was this? Las Vegas, I think. And it's being streamed all around the Internet.

2262
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I think some people are watching it while they're listening to the show. It's finishing up right now, I believe.

2263
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:46,000
And, of course, big controversy this week. Super Smash Brothers Melee was pulled from the live streaming schedule at one point.

2264
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Super Smash Brothers Melee was pulled from the weekend event in an update on shoryuken.com.

2265
02:10:51,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Evo co-founder Inkblot said, regrettably, we've just been informed by Nintendo of America that we do not have permission to broadcast Super Smash Brothers Melee for Evo 2013.

2266
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Well, now, this whole thing was a bit of a mess because in order to get the game featured in Evo in the first place, they had to do a charity fundraiser to raise the money.

2267
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Not for the tournament, but I think to get, like, the whole thing was, like, which fan communities can raise the most money for a good cause will feature those games in Evo.

2268
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:24,000
That's the sense I get from this whole thing. And sure enough, the fans of Smash Brothers Melee raised $90,000.

2269
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Well, in comes big bad Nintendo to pull the plug on this, you know, to not have this happen.

2270
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:46,000
But, thanks to the immense vocalness of the internet and trending topics on Twitter, Reddit, certainly a bit of a PR nightmare, and within hours Melee returned to be broadcast over the Evo 2013 tournament.

2271
02:11:46,000 --> 02:12:01,000
What's interesting, though, is that it did came out after that. So, it got reinstated. It was pulled, it was reinstated, but then it came out after that that co-founder Joey Quellar, I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong, said about the Evo.

2272
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:10,000
He's a co-founder of the Evo thing and an organizer. He said they were not only trying to shut down the stream, they were trying to shut down the event, the Smash portion of the event.

2273
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:15,000
It's their IP. They can do what they want. They didn't present us with any options to keep it open.

2274
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:23,000
But, of course, that obviously didn't happen. They ended up streaming it after all. This does seem like a real bad case of communication.

2275
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:29,000
And kind of the PR department saying one thing and the legal department coming through and saying another.

2276
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Nintendo is incredibly protective of their IPs and so forth. It sounds like it wasn't really understood what was going on.

2277
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:46,000
We already know there's some weird cloudiness with Nintendo's, you know, because of everything that happened with the Let's Play stuff not that long ago or anything like that either.

2278
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:52,000
You know what? I couldn't be helped but reminded of this. And you guys are gonna think I'm crazy, but deal with it. You already do.

2279
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,000
By the way, Evo, not E-V-O. It's evolution.

2280
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Oh, sorry. I thought I said E-V-O. Anyway, I thought of this. I was reminded of a couple years ago. Do you remember when Weird Al did that parody of Lady Gaga's Born This Way that was performed this way?

2281
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:19,000
And he said that he couldn't put it out. He was gonna do it as like a single or whatever. He couldn't put it out because Lady Gaga said no.

2282
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Lady Gaga, he always gets permission from the artist, or at least always tries. But if the artist says no, he won't put it out and Lady Gaga said no.

2283
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,000
And all these people started tweeting Lady Gaga like, you know, bitch, it's Weird Al. Let him do the song.

2284
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Well, turns out Lady Gaga comes out and says, I never heard the song. One of my people, like one of her legal people said no to it.

2285
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Even though that legal person in the response said Lady Gaga said no. But she had never heard it.

2286
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:56,000
And it wasn't until the whole thing blew up on the internet. I couldn't help but be reminded of that because unfortunately, yes, I'm comparing Nintendo to Lady Gaga. Hear me out here.

2287
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:05,000
But it's this whole big mess of he said, she said, right hand isn't talking to left hand. And this is the stuff that happens. And it did make Nintendo look stupid.

2288
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Like, you know, this is all for, well, it was done by charity for a good cause to bring positivity to an old Nintendo franchise.

2289
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:22,000
It's a game tournament. Who gives a crap? I don't understand why they would have such an objection to it. The only thing I can think of is because it's being broadcast.

2290
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:33,000
But I don't know. It's like, come on, you guys are trying this point. I think you want to salvage any sort of good faith you have with the community.

2291
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Since you kind of need them right now to buy your damn system, especially when the new Smash Brothers game comes out.

2292
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Maybe, I don't know, people see Smash Brothers that haven't really played the game while watching the EVO tournaments.

2293
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:53,000
And they're like, hey, you know, that looks kind of fun. Maybe I should buy the new Wii U and buy the new Smash Brothers game when it comes out.

2294
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Or you could say, fuck you, you ain't going to watch it. You're not going to get to watch this because we're just going to be dicks about it.

2295
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:07,000
And then, you know, now you're just pissed off a community and you're like, we're not buying your system or your game, so forget it.

2296
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
But then they'll buy the game because, you know, they have to have it.

2297
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Tigerclaw said that he heard that Super Smash Brothers Melee had over 130,000 people watching the livestream during the game's finals earlier today.

2298
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:21,000
It was the most watched fighting game in history, according to the co-founder of EVO.

2299
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Interesting, because the whole thing did kind of work out in the game. I mean, I think more people watched it because of this controversy.

2300
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I think a lot of people wouldn't have had an idea this was happening. I'm going to be honest. That's what happened.

2301
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:40,000
And then, of course, we have our Smarties in chat saying Act F says, play this way. Rama says, stream this way.

2302
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Ooh, baby, there is no way. We will let you stream that game. You cannot stream that game, no.

2303
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
No.

2304
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
I tried.

2305
02:15:51,000 --> 02:16:01,000
All right. Anyway, well, glad they worked it out, but legal department and big companies need to figure, you know, realize that this is the world we live in.

2306
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:08,000
It's yet another example of Nintendo does not understand the internet. This does not help their case.

2307
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
What is it, a series of tubes?

2308
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Yes, right? Dark Sakura.

2309
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:16,000
It's these wires and there's things on them and they do stuff.

2310
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:25,000
How about a new IP, a new franchise coming from Nintendo. This was actually voiced by Miyamoto.

2311
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:35,000
And God, I hate how this looks on my iPad. Basically, he let it slip that there is going to be a new franchise and he said this on the Japanese publication.

2312
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:49,000
He didn't release any details, but he said that they were trying to get away from relying on their longstanding franchises, wanting to innovate and go a bit further with what was out there.

2313
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Thank you.

2314
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,000
So maybe they finally understand how innovation works.

2315
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I'm glad that they're coming up with new IP, like the new IP that they launched the Wii system with.

2316
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Excite Truck needs a sequel, a good sequel. And I'm not talking about Excite Bots because that was crap.

2317
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,000
You don't put mini games in the middle of a fucking race.

2318
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Yeah.

2319
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I shouldn't have to throw a pie at a clown while I'm racing a car.

2320
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I do that all the time. It's called going to Disneyland with Dan.

2321
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Or make a sandwich. Literally, there was make a sandwich during Burger Time Racers.

2322
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Don't get me wrong. It's a funny idea. I mean, in playing the game, you're just like, what the fuck? You know, this is silly, but it's just...

2323
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:46,000
We need Wario's Wacky Races. Wouldn't that be crazy? Instead of a Mario Kart, do like a Wario Kart and have it be like just completely fucked up.

2324
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Well, this new Mario Kart 8, you're going upside down. Mario Kart 8 basically looks like F-Zero, which, like, it makes me happy.

2325
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Why can't we just have F-Zero?

2326
02:17:54,000 --> 02:18:02,000
It makes me really happy and really fucking irritated at the same time. Like, Nintendo, you're just like, you're fucking teasing me now. Stop it.

2327
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Nintendo, wrong.

2328
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I'm all for new IPs, though. You know, new IPs are fucking...

2329
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Build this wonderful engine for F-Zero and then we're like, eh, no one wants F-Zero.

2330
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Nobody wants F-Zero. Nobody wants that.

2331
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

2332
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Alright. So, Desura has actually been purchased up by, what was it, the Second Life company, Linden Labs.

2333
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:36,000
And so, what's that mean? I have no fucking clue. Other than, you know, it's changed ownership.

2334
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I don't think it's really going to change anything as far as, you know, the distribution service goes.

2335
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
So, yeah, it's interesting.

2336
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Maybe Second Life will become like PlayStation Home and you can launch games within Second Life.

2337
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Except with a lot more furry... No, actually, it is exactly like PlayStation Home.

2338
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:00,000
It would be exactly like PlayStation Home. It would be very meta because, like, PlayStation Home was kind of inspired by Second Life.

2339
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
But there are flying dicks in Second Life and not in PlayStation Home.

2340
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Well, there are dicks in PlayStation Home.

2341
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
They're not flying, though.

2342
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Do they have rocket packs?

2343
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Alright. You can file this in, you know, I don't know if this is Rule 37 or what, but this is just the gaming community at work here.

2344
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:34,000
There is a petition going around telling Microsoft, or I should say asking, demanding that Microsoft bring back the restrictive DRM policies that they had already rescinded due to outrage.

2345
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Yes, there are fans petitioning Microsoft to bring it back.

2346
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:41,000
It's actually a petition posted on change.org.

2347
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
I hate that site.

2348
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Why do you hate change.org?

2349
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Because you sign any petition on there and you get 50,000 spam emails from them.

2350
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:55,000
And, yeah, I'm all good for signing petitions, but not on that site.

2351
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
I will not sign a single one on that site.

2352
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Okay, so here's the petition.

2353
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:08,000
This was to be the future of entertainment, a new wave of gaming where you could buy games digitally, then trade, share, or sell those digital licenses.

2354
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Essentially, it was Steam for Xbox, but consumers were uninformed and railed against it, rallied against it, I think they meant to say, and it was taken away because Sony took advantage of consumers' uncertainty.

2355
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
We want this back. It can't be all or nothing. There must be a compromise.

2356
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Two, whoever, give us back the Xbox One we were promised at E3.

2357
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Sincerely, your name. They have hit 24,476 signatures.

2358
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Yeah, and a lot of those are just troll signatures, too, by the way, because they're like, yeah, we want them to do this.

2359
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:46,000
But I'm sorry, once again, comparing the digital marketplace that Xbox One would have to Steam is just stupid.

2360
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:52,000
And there's a perfect example of the difference right now with the Steam sale.

2361
02:20:52,000 --> 02:21:01,000
First off, you see a lot of discounts on Steam, and Steam is not the only place that you can get Steam games.

2362
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:16,000
You can get Steam games or Steam DRM-enabled games on Amazon, on Green Man Gaming, a bunch of different websites out there have these games at different prices all the time, so there's competing marketplaces.

2363
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,000
There are not competing marketplaces when Microsoft owns the marketplace.

2364
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,000
That is the only marketplace. The price that they have it on there is the price that you're going to pay for it.

2365
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:32,000
And on top of that, I think the whole reason was the whole game sharing thing, and we still don't know what the fucking details were on that.

2366
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,000
This is what pisses me off about this, too. You don't know what the fuck you're complaining about.

2367
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:43,000
You literally, and I say to all 24,000 of you, you literally do not know what the fuck you're complaining about.

2368
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:49,000
They never said what the rules were.

2369
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:58,000
I know this is a show where every gamer has a voice, and I welcome every opinion, but I can literally say this petition is ignorant.

2370
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Speaking of ignorant, and change.org, I have been informed that they no longer send out the emails.

2371
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Oh, okay, well that's good. Wow, you just fessed up to your own ignorance here on the show. It happens.

2372
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Well, it's because I ignored them for a while. I didn't care. Ignore ignorant. You know, same word. Same combination.

2373
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Humble Bundle, there's another perfect example of places you can get Steam games for dirt cheap.

2374
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:34,000
I'm just saying that's the problem. Even comparing the PlayStation Network store or Xbox Live marketplace to Steam is just ridiculous,

2375
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:39,000
because it's not an open platform as far as you're not going to have competing marketplaces out there.

2376
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:44,000
It's not like the retail marketplace where everyone's competing with each other. You have one central marketplace.

2377
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:48,000
You buy it their way, or you don't buy it at all. Origin.

2378
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Shadownextgen in our chat says, Skye, couldn't it be said that people originally didn't really know what they were complaining about?

2379
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:00,000
By the way, no I haven't signed the petition, nor do I plan to. I appreciate the devil's advocate perspective.

2380
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I know you're an Xbox fan, and unlike some of these people, I do think you do know what you're talking about.

2381
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:10,000
So let me humor this opinion here about, didn't we not originally know what we were complaining about?

2382
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:16,000
No, we did. Xbox made it very clear about the restrictions that they were putting into place.

2383
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
They have three pages in it.

2384
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Yeah, it was that whole official letter they put out there. It was very clear. There was no misinterpreting that.

2385
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:30,000
You will have to check in once every 24 hours. You will only be able to trade and use games through authorized vendors and all this stuff.

2386
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:41,000
That was in writing. And you can read between the lines and see that that meant that you would not be able to sell games yourself on eBay and so on and so on.

2387
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:46,000
The problem is, what they didn't communicate was the positive to offset that negative.

2388
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Family sharing was this big cloud out there. Ten people in your house can play the games, but how? What are the terms?

2389
02:23:54,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Because there's literally people out there, and I bet you the people signing this petition think that it was share with people across the internet the full, unhinged, complete game.

2390
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Ten people playing it all at once. Now we can all pool in on our game sales. I don't think any of you think that listening to this, but I think there were people out there that really think that.

2391
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:21,000
They thought that they could share games. Oh hey, I'm only going to have to pay $6 for this Xbox One game.

2392
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:26,000
And nine of my other friends are going to chip in as well and we can all play this game. No, I'm sorry. That's not the way it works.

2393
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:30,000
When in reality, it was probably like the GIMP to Drive Club thing, honestly.

2394
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:37,000
And seriously, do you really think that Microsoft would legitimately put out a service like that? That they would stand to lose money on?

2395
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,000
And they got beat by Sony. Sony took advantage of this. Yes, they did take advantage of this situation.

2396
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:44,000
That's what business is.

2397
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:53,000
That is business. And it's, to be fair, it's the exact flip of seven years ago when PlayStation embarrassed themselves at E3.

2398
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Anyhow, I wanted to read this comment to, where was it? Oh yes, this is very important.

2399
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:07,000
From Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com. Official quote from anti-consumer Blackwolf, with his quotey fingers.

2400
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Fuck those fans. Thank you Bobby. We'll end on that note.

2401
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Alright, moving on to the Mailbag. It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

2402
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
And if you were one of those people that signed that petition, I invite you to come at me bro.

2403
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com. In all seriousness, I could be respectful if you want to have a respectful discussion.

2404
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,000
But you have to admit that the petition is a little silly at this point. Just let it be.

2405
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
It's an online petition. I mean, come on.

2406
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:47,000
You know what? Before the Mailbag, this is important. I would fully support. Fully support.

2407
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:53,000
And I think this is what those people would want. So before you write your angry email, I'm gonna meet you halfway here.

2408
02:25:53,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I would be totally okay with this. With a physical disc license and a digital download license.

2409
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:06,000
And if you want to buy your game on physical disc, then game sharing and all that stuff works the way you know it today.

2410
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:11,000
And everything is just like, you know, like that shady PlayStation video and all that. Everything you know and love about games.

2411
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:18,000
But a digital download license would give you something different. I think that's kind of the place gaming ought to go.

2412
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Is that if you download a game, you have the freedom to choose. You get these perks.

2413
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Your perk for buying the game digitally is you get it day one without having to leave your...

2414
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,000
You could buy the game without pants. You won't have to leave your house.

2415
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:36,000
And you can give that game to a friend in New York or something cross-country.

2416
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,000
You know, it would have these different licenses. I am totally okay with that.

2417
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:45,000
And I would be behind Xbox One 100% with that. I just don't think it's gonna happen.

2418
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:51,000
And they can always come back. They said that later on they may implement some of the stuff that they got rid of.

2419
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Hopefully not all the bad things, but you know.

2420
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
They could just be there trying to find a way to integrate something that won't scare people off.

2421
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,000
But I can't support a petition that is like, switch it back to the way it was because everyone's stupid.

2422
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:08,000
We don't like it. We want it this way. But Daddy, I want the kiss that lays the golden eggs.

2423
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Alright, let's see what our emailers want this week.

2424
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Dark Soccer's gonna dive in head first and find the email she's gonna read now.

2425
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Dear OLR.

2426
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Looks like this is a bad nut.

2427
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Dear OLR, I just wanted to say, as always, that you have an awesome show.

2428
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I wanted to share with you a game I recently acquired on Steam. It's called Akaneiro Demon Hunters.

2429
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:42,000
It plays a lot like Okami in the sense that you get shards for each demon you killed.

2430
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:45,000
This is a storyline... learn to spell.

2431
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2432
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Straight. Not with an E, with an A. From Steam.

2433
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I'm not very good at descriptions, so I took this one from the official game site.

2434
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Akaneiro Demon Hunters transports you to a world realized in a striking visual style inspired by Japanese ink, water, and woodblock illustration.

2435
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:10,000
We've dug deep into the history and folklore of Japan when designing our scenarios and characters.

2436
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Mixing this foundation with an original mythology inspired by Red Riding Hood has yielded a fantastic and inspiring setting for players to explore.

2437
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:26,000
It was produced, I think, by Spicy Horse who was in charge of American movies Alice Madness Returns, which is another awesome game by the way.

2438
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Hope you guys can check it out. It's on Steam for $10 now.

2439
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
The graphics are stunning and remind me a lot of Okami as it looks like drawings on the screen.

2440
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Hope you guys get to check it out sometime and as always happy gaming and thanks for letting every gamer have a voice. Sincerely, GG.

2441
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
You're welcome.

2442
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Thank you. I might have to give it a try if I have money.

2443
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I like hearing about game reviews about games I haven't really heard a lot of, so thank you.

2444
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:55,000
This comes from Rob-a-b-b-b-b.

2445
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Like Rob, I got caught up in the Steam Trading Cards thingy. It seems to be never ending.

2446
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Just for fun, I bought my missing Binding of Isaac cards. Then I converted them to a badge. Not only did that eat all the cards, I got a booster pack soon after with more Binding of Isaac cards.

2447
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:16,000
One of the cards was a foil and so now I have a foil badge to collect.

2448
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:23,000
The regular trading cards can power up my existing badge, so there's no reason for selling or trading cards unless they're duplicates.

2449
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:30,000
I was using $5 of my own money plus selling my duplicates to obtain a full set. I still have almost $3 left over, pro tip.

2450
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Don't try buying the cards at the top of the queue on the marketplace. It will most likely be gone before you can complete your transaction.

2451
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:52,000
I don't think the trading card system was running 2-5 July because I paid for hours and got no drops.

2452
02:29:52,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Lastly, the cards are worth zooming in on. The Fairy Solitaire cards are actually panoramas from the game. The artwork will probably look way better zoomed in.

2453
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:09,000
That is very true. If you are getting those cards, take a minute to actually look at them because there is some really good artwork. Especially if it's a game you really do appreciate.

2454
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:14,000
I know we probably don't have a lot of hardcore Fairy Solitaire fans out there. Well, except Dark Sakura.

2455
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I'm not really hardcore. I just play it when I get incredibly bored.

2456
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:25,000
It is a good game, to be fair. What's the difference between Fairy Solitaire and old school Windows 3.1 Solitaire?

2457
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Well, because it's not exactly Solitaire. It's arranged out a little bit differently.

2458
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Yeah, it's a little special. But, anyhow. Yeah, the trading card thing is fun. And, thank you RaBaba for doing trading cards with me last week.

2459
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Bronnman sent an email that just said 573. So, maybe we hit our lives.

2460
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Did we hit it? Oh, maybe we did. Thank you, Rama. I'm looking now.

2461
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:55,000
We have another email that I'm just going to go ahead and read it, but I'm not going to say the guy's full name.

2462
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:02,000
So, my name is Jeff Gee, and I've worked at an ESPN affiliate radio station for three years.

2463
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:08,000
I've played video games since I can remember. I'm interested in video games radio and would love to send in my resume and some clips of me on air.

2464
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Sorry, we're not hiring because we don't pay anything.

2465
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
I didn't see this email, really.

2466
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:19,000
If nothing comes of this email, I would still like to commend you for living the dream of talking about video games.

2467
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

2468
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Well, bless your heart, sir.

2469
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,000
If we could afford to pay, we would be paid.

2470
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Yeah, unfortunately, this is an all-volunteer organization, but I will throw this out there.

2471
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:43,000
VOG is looking for more shows. Now, we're looking for established shows because we want to make sure that the people we recruit aren't going to throw in the towel after you.

2472
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:49,000
I mean, look to the site's credit at Voice of Gee's network. We've had the same lineup for like a year.

2473
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:52,000
The shows haven't left, which is a great testament.

2474
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Inevitably, some shows are going to throw in the towel eventually. That's just the way things go.

2475
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:05,000
But we want to make sure that the shows we get are established shows that will go for a year or two if we're going to invest the promo and so forth in the shows.

2476
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:12,000
If you do have a show that's interested in being on the network, get in touch with me directly, robatvognetwork.com.

2477
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
I will say this, unfortunately, to this guy.

2478
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:20,000
We're not really looking for video game shows right now because we have a bunch between Girls Gone Wow, Horde House, us, Bobby.

2479
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,000
We're looking for some more general geekdom shows to diversify the palette a little bit.

2480
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:28,000
But I could tell you comic book shows are right at the top of the list.

2481
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I would love a board game, card game, non-video game type show.

2482
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:42,000
I would love, love, love a show that is larping live or playing a game live, one of those types of shows.

2483
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I would make a great cereal. So just throwing that out there.

2484
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:53,000
If you have an established show along those lines, get in touch with me, robatvognetwork.com, and we'll see what we can do.

2485
02:32:53,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Otherwise, I invite this guy to just join, call our show some night.

2486
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,000
If you're around on a Sunday night, give our show a call.

2487
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Yeah.

2488
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Let's talk, we'll be happy to talk video games with you.

2489
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
And who knows?

2490
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
For free.

2491
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:15,000
And who knows, you know, you might find your niche in the geekdom market too.

2492
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:19,000
You know, we might, there's sports geeks out there.

2493
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:22,000
You said you worked for ESPN affiliates, so who knows?

2494
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:26,000
We got sports geek talk as long as there's no wrestling because that would drive Bobby crazy.

2495
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Unless it's like 80s wrestling, how could that drive anybody crazy?

2496
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,000
80s wrestling was the best.

2497
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Your theme song has to be Hulk Hogan's, I am a real American.

2498
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Cause you know, anyway.

2499
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

2500
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Every week here on the show, oh by the way, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

2501
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:50,000
If you would like to send in your mail, please, no resumes.

2502
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

2503
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Here's the FUs of the week time.

2504
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:12,000
FU to Bitchface.

2505
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,000
She doesn't listen to the show.

2506
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Some people know who Bitchface is.

2507
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
FU.

2508
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
And also my hip.

2509
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:25,000
And the stupid cough that I am now going on to week five.

2510
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Fuck.

2511
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Done.

2512
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Uh, Logie.

2513
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
FU detention headaches.

2514
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I always get them.

2515
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
And I have one now.

2516
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:40,000
I'm going to follow that up with my own FU to headaches.

2517
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Cause I had a really bad one yesterday that pretty much ruined my day.

2518
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,000
I will say that, but I guess shit happens.

2519
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Bradley, do you have any FUs you want to get off your chest?

2520
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,000
FU to my back for hurting after California Extreme yesterday.

2521
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:56,000
And then seriously fuck you to this uh,

2522
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Wingstomp employee said they wouldn't take my order cause it's getting late at 1030

2523
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:06,000
when I ordered after 11, 11 like several times.

2524
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,000
He said, we're really late.

2525
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,000
And it basically went and just said fuck you to him right there.

2526
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Never saying that.

2527
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Cause I don't know if it was tone or just he set me off for some reason.

2528
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
But that was kind of the stupid answer.

2529
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,000
I don't know if there was something going on or they're closing earlier or something.

2530
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Don't you dare get between me and my wings.

2531
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
It's like a crime.

2532
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Yeah.

2533
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
All right.

2534
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Uh, there it is.

2535
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Uh, FUs of the week.

2536
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Let's move on with a couple more news stories and then you guys can give us a call in a moment here.

2537
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Uh, Loki.

2538
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:45,000
You may remember a time when Sony's uh, online network was hacked.

2539
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Pepperidge Farm remembers.

2540
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:50,000
And uh, Sony they uh,

2541
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:54,000
they basically got fined in the UK.

2542
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Uh, they had to pay a 250,000 pound fine.

2543
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:02,000
And they were originally appealing it.

2544
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Now they decided they're going to withdraw that.

2545
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:09,000
So after careful consideration we are withdrawing our appeal.

2546
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:17,000
This decision reflects our commitment to protecting the confidentiality of our network security from disclosures in the course of proceedings.

2547
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:23,000
And we continue to disagree with the decision on the merits.

2548
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:29,000
So they're gonna, they disagree but they're gonna pay for it.

2549
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:33,000
We don't like this but we'll do it anyway.

2550
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:42,000
I'm wondering if they did appeal it that they would go, maybe there would be some sort of trial where like information would come out about how shoddy their protection was.

2551
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:48,000
And they didn't want that so they decided to go ahead and pay the original settlement or something. I don't know, whatever.

2552
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Cool. Water in the bridge.

2553
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Alright. Although the entire gaming community have probably already forgotten about the hack. Never forget.

2554
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:01,000
I shouldn't say the entire community but a big chunk of them.

2555
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Rageinator said how about a show that combines wrestling, bronies, and furries.

2556
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:08,000
And I said that sounds like really bad porn.

2557
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Would that be Dogpile?

2558
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:14,000
It will air at 3am on Tuesday morning.

2559
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Yes, we can have the wrestling, bronies, furries show.

2560
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:24,000
It will air at 4am on No Day. Ever. In the never.

2561
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:33,000
All joking aside, you know, as much as I say we're kind of full up on video game shows right now, I would love to see a Mega Man show. I don't know.

2562
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:41,000
But anyway, Mega Man is a die hard community and the community makes a lot of great fan projects.

2563
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:45,000
And one of them is on its way out, Mega Man Revolution.

2564
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:51,000
It's been in development since 2002. It tries to recreate the magic of the NES games.

2565
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,000
You can also, I guess, enable slow down and so forth.

2566
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:57,000
A lot of early reaction. This game is too hard.

2567
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:00,000
But also that it's a solid fan game.

2568
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:04,000
So you can check that out. MegaManRevolution.com slash download.

2569
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:07,000
It is a free download since this is a fan project.

2570
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I haven't seen Capcom trying to shut it down.

2571
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:12,000
I guess that's good news. But it's on the internet now so you'll never shut it down.

2572
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:15,000
So go enjoy that.

2573
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:18,000
I suppose nothing wrong with keeping up the awareness of Mega Man.

2574
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Especially with he will be in the next Smash Brothers of course.

2575
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Inevitably, Capcom will dust him off and bring him out in another game.

2576
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:29,000
It's gotta happen, right? Someday. Someday.

2577
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:32,000
By the way, I did get sent a picture here.

2578
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:36,000
We did get our 573rd like on Facebook.

2579
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Thank you.

2580
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I appreciate it. That doesn't mean to stop liking us on Facebook.

2581
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Because the next goal would be, what would it be? Probably like 5730?

2582
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:51,000
No, it would be 1337.

2583
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Oh, okay. That's an admirable goal.

2584
02:38:54,000 --> 02:39:00,000
And of course, Mega Man Revolution, I would mention that there is also Mega Man Unlimited which was released today.

2585
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
And you can download that at MegaPhilX.com.

2586
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Is that Phil like a dude named Phil or Phil like F-I-L-L?

2587
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Phil like a dude named Phil.

2588
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Alrighty. I guess that is about it for the show.

2589
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:22,000
But we do want to take an opportunity to open up our skype line for you guys to have your say on anything we've talked about tonight.

2590
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Or maybe something we missed. 1877 Game O-L-R or a username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2591
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
All one word if you'd like to give us a call.

2592
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,000
And we'll talk about whatever you'd like, within reason.

2593
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Let's get to some Twitter topics and last minute stories while we wait for those to come in.

2594
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Alright, so there's the Tekken Revolution. Remember the free to play Tekken game that's going to be coming out?

2595
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Well, they have a poll up right now for some new candidates, I guess, that are going to be added to the game.

2596
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Some of these were kind of B-roll characters that didn't even make it into certain games.

2597
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:06,000
For example, there's one character that's a fish. A fish man. And all he can do is flop around.

2598
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Zombie bride, giant preen mantis, average run of the mill old man.

2599
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Yes, he's an old man who can't fight.

2600
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,000
What about middle aged man?

2601
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
And female Paul.

2602
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Let me get to the phones because the phones are ringing here.

2603
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2604
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,000
It's Jason.

2605
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Hey, Jason. How you doing?

2606
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Hi, Jason.

2607
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Can we go back to Nostalgia Land?

2608
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Of course we can. I love Nostalgia Land.

2609
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I was driving back from a friend's concert and you guys were going to the mailbag and I was just driving along the highway just going,

2610
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Yeah, right. I know. I want to build a house out of pixels in Nostalgia Land and live there.

2611
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:47,000
A fort. I will have my pixel fort in Nostalgia Land.

2612
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:50,000
What do you want to talk about in Nostalgia Land? What makes you nostalgic?

2613
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Prop cycle.

2614
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,000
They have one.

2615
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Yes. Prop cycle is awesome.

2616
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:59,000
They have one. Not in the prop cycle, Addams Family, but they had a prop cycle.

2617
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Believe it or not, some of our listeners don't know what prop cycle is, so please explain it.

2618
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Prop cycle was an exercise game. Essentially you sat on an exercise bike that had a two-handed flight stick and you could tilt it forward, pull it back, obviously turn right and left.

2619
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:25,000
You couldn't just crank the pedals continuously because the game, I think it was basically like exertion prevention built into the game,

2620
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:32,000
but you just pedaled persistently and flew around popping balloons and not crashing into things.

2621
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,000
There you go. And it was just a lot of fun to play. It was so silly looking too.

2622
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:43,000
It was so fun. Rio Rancho, my hometown, doesn't actually have a mall still to this day.

2623
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:49,000
The mall that got closest to us, Cottonwood Mall, is just on the other side of the city limit border.

2624
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:55,000
But when that was first built up, the movie theater downstairs had a very tiny little arcade.

2625
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:01,000
It had a metal slug, I want to say, a Neo Geo multi-cab, and a couple of other typical things.

2626
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:08,000
But upstairs, for the first couple of years of that mall's existence, there was a divided laser tag.

2627
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Excuse me. A divided laser tag, meaning that you can't cross any of the other person's territory, and it had Sega City.

2628
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:23,000
And that was like, with the exception of the roller rink that we used to go to when I was younger, way the hell out in Albuquerque,

2629
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Sega City was like my personal arcade back in the day, and that's where I played Prop Cycle.

2630
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:32,000
And it was one of those things where whenever we would go, I would play that.

2631
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:38,000
And it was such a great game, and I always had such a fun time, but as that place declined,

2632
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:46,000
the screen CRT and the general death of that kind of thing just kind of slowly but surely started to whitewash

2633
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:52,000
and fall off and burn in before the entire place just got taken out to pasture.

2634
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:59,000
But it was a great game. I've literally never seen that in any other arcade to my mind, to my memory.

2635
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Don't they have these weird hacks for Prop Cycle, where they hook up Prop Cycle to other games?

2636
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Like, wouldn't there even be a pinball game that ran off Prop Cycle?

2637
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:15,000
As a matter of fact, my friends out here in Colorado, before I moved out here, hooked up a Poppin' Music of some sort

2638
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:22,000
to the Prop Cycle TV, and they dubbed it Propin' Music.

2639
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
That's awesome.

2640
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:28,000
I unfortunately wasn't up here for the occasion, but I saw pictures and it was definitely amazing.

2641
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Good times.

2642
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:33,000
There's one game, so I've never known the name of this game.

2643
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:43,000
My brain does really weird things when specific details of things go away, and I wonder if you guys know this arcade game.

2644
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:47,000
I seem to remember it in the roller skating rink that I used to go to as a kid.

2645
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Basically, what it boils down to is you're a character that runs around a roller coaster collecting cherries,

2646
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
and you have to dodge the roller coaster.

2647
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,000
I've never been able to find the actual cars on the roller coaster.

2648
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
I've never been able to find this game.

2649
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Is that Mr. Do's Wild Ride?

2650
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Mr. Do's Wild Ride.

2651
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Sounds like it. If you're collecting cherries, it's Mr. Do.

2652
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Come on, Wikipedia. Give me a screenshot and not just the box art.

2653
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:26,000
This is the thing that I kind of run into is that the image is ridiculously small.

2654
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:33,000
I seem to remember it being very, very circular with ladders that connect you to the different portions.

2655
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Yep, that's Mr. Do's Wild Ride.

2656
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
I'm almost positive.

2657
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Go to Google.

2658
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Check it out on Google. Do a Google search.

2659
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Wow, okay, okay. Yeah, this starts a scene.

2660
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:51,000
It's so weird because my brain, filling in the gaps now that I actually have game screenshots,

2661
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:59,000
this kind of seems to make sense, but my brain remembers this game looking a little bit better, I guess.

2662
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:02,000
A little bit newer than this actually is.

2663
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:05,000
The resolution on old games is going to be itty bitty.

2664
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Oh, of course.

2665
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Yeah, so I think that's part of it.

2666
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:09,000
It's all about raster.

2667
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Yeah.

2668
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
The detail of this thing just seems...

2669
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:15,000
What I remember and what this looks like is entirely different.

2670
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,000
I want a classic arcade Smash Brothers game, like with Mr. Do in there.

2671
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:22,000
That also might be the platform you're looking at.

2672
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:25,000
I don't know if that screen is an actual arcade shot that you're looking at,

2673
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:29,000
but there was also a Commodore 64 version, so you might be seeing a different version of it.

2674
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Oh, wow.

2675
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
I'm looking at Rob's image search.

2676
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:37,000
There's all these screen captures, and then there's a really badly drawn cock.

2677
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
It says you mad on it.

2678
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:42,000
What does that have to do with Mr. Do's wild ride? I don't know.

2679
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Thank you, Google Images.

2680
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Thank you, Google Images.

2681
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:48,000
That's what I get for turning safe search off.

2682
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
No one wants to search safe. Come on.

2683
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:55,000
You can't have your search for a cock in a fair game.

2684
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Well, I'm glad we got to play Identify the Classic Arcade Game.

2685
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:03,000
I've been meaning to ask somebody about this for literally years.

2686
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Dropping back into Nostalgia Land actually reminded me of it.

2687
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Maybe Jamie can help me with this one, because she's a big Namco girl.

2688
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:17,000
They did a re-release of Pac-Man in some type of anniversary set that not only had Pac-Man,

2689
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:21,000
but it had Dig Dug 2, and it might have had one other game.

2690
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:24,000
I don't know if it was a tenth anniversary or a fifteenth anniversary.

2691
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,000
There was some type of anniversary collection that had these games in it,

2692
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:30,000
and they were like up-rezzed. Not like Pac-Mania or anything like that.

2693
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:34,000
It was Pac-Man with some subtle differences, but it had Dig Dug in it too,

2694
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
and I really want to play that again.

2695
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
It was like a choose-your-game.

2696
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:41,000
Yes, it was a choose-your-game, and you could play either Pac-Man or Dig Dug.

2697
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:45,000
I want to say they have one at the Roseville Dave and Busters.

2698
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Really?

2699
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:49,000
I want to say. I know I've seen one.

2700
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:53,000
I just want to know where I can get the meme wrong. Let's be real.

2701
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Anywhere, probably.

2702
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Well, I want to know what it's called so I can get it.

2703
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
I think it is one of the anniversary editions.

2704
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:02,000
I don't remember the name, but I know I've seen one, and I know I've played one.

2705
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Okay, I'll have to do some Google-Fu on that because I was thinking of that game earlier.

2706
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Anyhow, it was a nice trip down nostalgia lane, Jason.

2707
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:16,000
It was. It was a great 20 minutes. A good way to kill my drive.

2708
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
No problem. That's what I appreciate about this show.

2709
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:21,000
It's a great way to kill a long commuter drive.

2710
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:25,000
I'm going to get to see you in a couple weeks, yes?

2711
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Perhaps. Not in Sacramento, I don't think.

2712
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:32,000
I'm surprisingly busy considering how long I'm going to be out in the Bay Area,

2713
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,000
but yes, I am definitely there for the upcoming con at the start of next month.

2714
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Yes, I know you'll be, even if you're not going to GamerX, you'll be in the area,

2715
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:45,000
and I'll be able to meet up with you there, which gives me another opportunity to promote

2716
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:52,000
the little panel dealy going on Saturday at GamerX in San Francisco, August 3rd?

2717
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:55,000
I think it is the date. It's that Saturday.

2718
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:05,000
And I am doing a panel with my buddies from Koopa Club and Game Bar and Game Buoy,

2719
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:08,000
and I know I'm leaving somebody else out, so I apologize in advance,

2720
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:13,000
but all us guys are getting together doing a podcast cross zone panel,

2721
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:18,000
and we're just going to be talking about podcasting, our show is kind of how we got into it,

2722
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:22,000
and trying to enable more people to get their voices heard, so it'll be fun.

2723
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Yes.

2724
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,000
We'll have a gay old time.

2725
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,000
It'll be a good time.

2726
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Yeah, gay meaning happy.

2727
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:27,000
You left.

2728
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:28,000
All right.

2729
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Oh, excuse me. Wow.

2730
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
You need to take me to that place in Castro you were talking about earlier, too.

2731
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Which place? Hot Cookie?

2732
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Um, no.

2733
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Oh, Moby Dick.

2734
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
The bar with the pinball bar.

2735
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:40,000
So it's literally going to become that song that's,

2736
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:45,000
you, I'm going to take you to a gay bar.

2737
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
And I'm choking, so have a good night, guys.

2738
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,000
All right. Bye, Jason.

2739
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Thank you for mentioning Hot Cookie, because now I want to go there.

2740
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
All right. Let's go to another call on the line.

2741
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

2742
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Hi, this is Azurmay.

2743
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Azurmay. Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?

2744
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,000
I was just talking to one of my friends about the show,

2745
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:09,000
and he actually came up and brought up the whole looking for a new show,

2746
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
and we kind of do a show.

2747
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:15,000
But it's kind of based off of, like, Japanese culture

2748
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:19,000
and, like, how Japanese culture affects American culture

2749
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:22,000
with a little bit of, like, learning a little bits of Japanese.

2750
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:25,000
We do things through Facebook and Adobe Connect.

2751
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Interesting.

2752
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
But I was just throwing that, like, out there.

2753
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Maybe, like, the chat would be able to see, like,

2754
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:33,000
if that's something they were interested in listening to.

2755
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Well, Pimp, your show, I'm all about support and indie shows.

2756
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Tell us where we can find it.

2757
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Okay, well, the name of the actual show is, like,

2758
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Learning Japanese Through Music.

2759
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:47,000
And we kind of try to...

2760
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:51,000
You can look on Facebook at facebook.com slash groups,

2761
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Japanese Through Anime,

2762
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
and you can probably see the page there.

2763
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:57,000
You can actually add.

2764
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
We have, like, Thursday nights.

2765
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,000
We have, like, a three-hour...

2766
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Like, it basically starts out with two hours of, like, a song,

2767
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
and then after, like, the last hour is like a karaoke

2768
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
where we get a chance to sing the song,

2769
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:14,000
but we break down the song and kind of, like, practice Japanese.

2770
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Like, last week, the...

2771
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
I don't know if anybody follows the new anime

2772
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan.

2773
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
That show is crazy.

2774
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Yeah, well, we broke down the show,

2775
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
and, like, in... Not the show, I'm sorry.

2776
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
We broke down the song into, like, different parts

2777
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
and translated it, and then at the end of the show,

2778
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:34,000
we kind of, like, all sing, like, on Adobe Connect.

2779
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:37,000
And, you know, we also have a meetup that we also...

2780
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Some of the local people kind of speak, you know,

2781
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:43,000
we meet up in person and kind of sing at, like, karaoke bars, but...

2782
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:46,000
I don't know why, but I love the idea

2783
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
that your show ends with karaoke.

2784
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Like, I don't know a lot of shows that do that.

2785
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Like, maybe we need to do that here at OLR.

2786
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
We end every night with a rousing rendition of

2787
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:02,000
So Long, Farewell, Avita's Ain't Good Night.

2788
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
I second the no.

2789
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Damn it.

2790
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
I'm branching out and doing my own show.

2791
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:12,000
You know, the lag kind of, like, throws people off.

2792
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
It does give you a chance to learn a little bit more

2793
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:18,000
about the anime or the Japanese pop band

2794
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
that you're probably interested in,

2795
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
and maybe a little few words of Japanese, too, but...

2796
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Well, we do have a show about anime on the network

2797
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
called Anime Jam Session, which is a good time,

2798
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
but it sounds like you have a different approach

2799
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,000
to the way you do it.

2800
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
It sounds like a lot of fun.

2801
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
I will have to check that out.

2802
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
That sounds fun.

2803
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Shoot me an email, robatvognetwork.com,

2804
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
and we'll chat a little more.

2805
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Cool.

2806
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Well, other than that, that's pretty much it.

2807
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
You guys still playing Final Fantasy XIV, right?

2808
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Ready for phase four?

2809
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
I have been playing the shit out of that beta.

2810
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
I don't know a better way to put it.

2811
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
I literally, I told myself this weekend,

2812
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:52,000
I'm not going to play it.

2813
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I'm done.

2814
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:54,000
I'm just, I'm going to wait for the,

2815
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:55,000
I don't want my character to get erased,

2816
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
and then I'm sitting there and I'm leveling.

2817
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
I think I got to level 25,

2818
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:02,000
and I was doing the Totama dungeon this morning,

2819
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
which is like, I mean, there's only one other dungeon

2820
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
in the beta after that, and I just,

2821
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
I'm not going to be able to have enough time to get to that,

2822
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
but I, yeah, I've been playing the shit out of that beta.

2823
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
It's a lot of fun.

2824
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,000
That's cool.

2825
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Okay, great, because, like, I was wondering

2826
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
if you guys had, like, a little group on here

2827
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
that might be doing some sort of, like,

2828
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
free company LOR.

2829
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:22,000
We will.

2830
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,000
We don't have a link shell yet.

2831
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:24,000
I actually made one for,

2832
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,000
I did?

2833
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Yes, but link shells are really just chat channels.

2834
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,000
The free companies are really the, like, guilds,

2835
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,000
a la WoW or whatever.

2836
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
There will absolutely be something like that.

2837
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:37,000
At least Horde House is going to lead one somewhere.

2838
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:40,000
I will have more information on that

2839
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,000
when we know the full server list.

2840
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Right now we're on Behemoth,

2841
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
but that could change for phase four,

2842
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
but we're going to commit to something soonish here.

2843
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
We just want to figure out where our frenzies are going to be

2844
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
and try to pick the best server.

2845
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Cool, cool, okay.

2846
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
All right, so I'll just continue to just chime in

2847
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
on the network and find out more.

2848
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:59,000
We will whore the shit out of it here on OLR

2849
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,000
once the game's out.

2850
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Awesome.

2851
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:02,000
All right, guys.

2852
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:03,000
All right.

2853
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Well, you take care, buddy.

2854
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Good luck with your show.

2855
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:06,000
Adobe Connect.

2856
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,000
I have not heard, you know, Adobe Connect,

2857
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
I know because during my day job,

2858
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,000
I'm a corporate trainer,

2859
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:13,000
so I've used Adobe Connect in meetings of that sort,

2860
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:16,000
but I've never heard of doing a podcast through Adobe Connect,

2861
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:17,000
but I'm thinking about it going,

2862
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:18,000
well, it makes sense.

2863
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,000
It would work.

2864
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,000
Why not, right?

2865
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:23,000
It's very similar to Google Hangout in many ways.

2866
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Yeah, besides the payments,

2867
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
unfortunately it's kind of expensive,

2868
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
like $80 a month,

2869
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:32,000
and you get a chance to utilize some of the tools

2870
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:35,000
like talking through a chat menu,

2871
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
controlling the desktop,

2872
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
and even passing the microphone or the camera

2873
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
to someone else in the chat.

2874
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
It's a little bit more interactive.

2875
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:47,000
I think that maybe if we moved to something like this

2876
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
we'd probably be dying, you know, so.

2877
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Good times.

2878
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:51,000
All right, buddy.

2879
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Well, thanks for the call.

2880
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Good luck with your show,

2881
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
and we'll talk to you again here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2882
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Thanks.

2883
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:57,000
All right, later.

2884
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:00,000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype,

2885
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2886
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
I just got a tweet.

2887
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
I love the interactiveness of the show.

2888
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:08,000
I just got a tweet from Gaming Nerd

2889
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
who goes by GNVersion2 on Twitter

2890
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,000
that says Namco Classic Collection Volume 2

2891
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:17,000
is a collection featuring Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Rally X,

2892
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
I think that was, yes, the other game,

2893
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:22,000
in both original and arrangement versions.

2894
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Hold on, I'm Googling this right now

2895
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:24,000
to see if it's what I remember.

2896
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Somebody help me fill time while I ask for more calls.

2897
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
I probably have that at home, you know,

2898
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
that Namco collection.

2899
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Well, I mean, the ones that they released at home,

2900
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:38,000
but yeah, I think I do remember that one

2901
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
because that was it, that was it.

2902
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Yes, this is it.

2903
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
This is totally what I was thinking of.

2904
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
You win a cookie.

2905
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:46,000
I don't know how to,

2906
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,000
I'm gonna shove a cookie through Twitter,

2907
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
and I hope it made it in one piece.

2908
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:50,000
That is exactly the game I was thinking of.

2909
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,000
That person probably already has

2910
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
lots of cookies on their computer.

2911
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Probably.

2912
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Yes, that is exactly the game I was thinking of.

2913
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:57,000
I'm looking at these screenshots.

2914
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:58,000
I remember this whole little one

2915
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
with like Pac-Man and the temple

2916
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:01,000
and with the little jumps.

2917
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:04,000
Yep, you, sir, are win.

2918
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Thank you.

2919
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:10,000
And next, hook me up with a link for a ROM.

2920
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
All right.

2921
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
Love the interactiveness here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2922
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Let's go to the tweets.

2923
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:16,000
That was on my personal Twitter,

2924
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
but you know what?

2925
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Sometimes I'm gonna bring up personal stuff on the show

2926
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
because I had to know what game that was.

2927
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
Let's go to tweets that went to the OLR account,

2928
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
and then, Loki, I'll go over to you

2929
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:27,000
for some more last-minute stories.

2930
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Again, 1877 game OLR or username on Skype,

2931
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to get in on the show.

2932
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Sj100matt sent us a tweet that says,

2933
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:37,000
there's a Kickstarter to help open the largest pinball museum

2934
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:38,000
in Southern California, too.

2935
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
You know I got a text message on this.

2936
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:41,000
They were at Cosigami Expo.

2937
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Melody sent me a text on this,

2938
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:47,000
and I think we might have an interview with them

2939
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:48,000
in the coming weeks.

2940
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
I don't want to promise, but that might actually happen.

2941
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:51,000
But you can check that out.

2942
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:54,000
They're called Museum of Pinball on Twitter.

2943
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:57,000
They've only raised 15,000 out of 150,000,

2944
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
but they've got 24 days to go, so they might make it.

2945
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:02,000
But that's pretty awesome.

2946
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:03,000
I hope they do it.

2947
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:06,000
They're going to build a huge museum of pinball.

2948
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Isn't there already a museum in the Bay Area?

2949
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,000
There's also one in Las Vegas.

2950
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Yeah?

2951
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
In fact, I've been to the one in Las Vegas

2952
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
before they moved to their newer location,

2953
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
and the one in Las Vegas has a pinball circus

2954
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:20,000
and all kinds of machines you just don't see anywhere.

2955
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
All right, some other tweets here.

2956
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
DJ Rama sent us a link about,

2957
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Xbox One gets booed out of Evo while demoing Killer Instinct.

2958
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Ouch.

2959
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,000
This doesn't sound good.

2960
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
I'm trying to bring up the story right now.

2961
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:39,000
I don't know if the booing is just sensationalism or what,

2962
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:40,000
but let's see.

2963
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Apparently, fucking ads.

2964
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:47,000
I'm having a hard time bringing this up on my phone.

2965
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:48,000
Let's see.

2966
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
The Double Helix and Mad Catz guys were at Evo

2967
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:54,000
to pimp fight stick accessories and Killer Instinct,

2968
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:57,000
which, of course, was originally shown at E3,

2969
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:03,000
and a lot of hostility, I guess, shown at the event,

2970
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:06,000
even though the gameplay for Killer Instinct looked pretty good,

2971
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
and there's a video on there.

2972
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:12,000
But then it says the crowd was moderately accepting of Killer Instinct,

2973
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:15,000
but the fact that they were booing the Xbox One at such a core event

2974
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:21,000
like Evo 2013 speaks volumes about what gamers actually feel about the console.

2975
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:22,000
These weren't casuals.

2976
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:25,000
These weren't grandpas and grandmas buying consoles for Little Timmy.

2977
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
These are the Big Timmies.

2978
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,000
Hmm.

2979
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
The story from Cinnamablend.com.

2980
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:33,000
So it just sounds like a few angry mobsters.

2981
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:36,000
I don't know how much I...

2982
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:37,000
I don't know.

2983
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:41,000
It sounds like there were just a few angry gaming nerds there,

2984
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:45,000
and, you know, they unfortunately got picked up by the media.

2985
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Ooh, I heard about this.

2986
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
Sj100mad is also sending us this tweet.

2987
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Even I'm excited about this, and this says a lot.

2988
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:56,000
NHL 14, you know, hockey, is going to have an NHL 94 mode,

2989
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:59,000
which is like one of the best games ever, right?

2990
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Complete with original sound effects, controls, and visuals.

2991
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Amazing.

2992
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,000
You know what's sad is that's totally going to sell tons of copies of that game,

2993
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:10,000
because NHL 94 is like one of the best sports games ever.

2994
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Now, before I give you all those concessions, Sj100mad,

2995
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:15,000
I'm going to say this.

2996
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:20,000
NHL 94 is no Blades of Steel, but it's still pretty cool.

2997
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
I know a lot of people disagree with me there.

2998
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:28,000
AJ Twist wanted to alert us to the Ultra Street Fighter IV game as well.

2999
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:36,000
ActDeft is tweeting us about Mane6, who created Fighting is Magic,

3000
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:39,000
is posting progress on their new game.

3001
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Didn't they have to do something where they took the license out of it,

3002
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
and now it's like a different type of game?

3003
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:47,000
So I'm trying to scan through the update here real quick.

3004
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:51,000
Did they just change the horses, basically?

3005
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Maybe.

3006
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:56,000
Magical horse fighting game or something now?

3007
02:58:56,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Well, it's some behind-the-scenes look at Mane6.com.

3008
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,000
You can check that out there.

3009
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
It's a little bit technical.

3010
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:06,000
I was hoping we could see a little more in-game or whatever,

3011
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:10,000
but you can at least see the work that goes into drawing these things.

3012
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:14,000
I guess why it is such a big deal when you have to go back and change the characters.

3013
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:18,000
I'm sure ActDeft had something else he wants me to mention on that.

3014
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
He'll yell it in chat real quick.

3015
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:23,000
But while I'm waiting for that, I will mention TigerClaw's tweet here

3016
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
that says Valve introduces Pipeline,

3017
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:28,000
a program for teens seeking careers in the game industry.

3018
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
That's pretty cool.

3019
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:33,000
I'm trying to read more about this here.

3020
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:36,000
I get it. Valve, Pipeline. Get it? Get it?

3021
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:41,000
Pipeline is a program for teens seeking careers in the game industry.

3022
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
I get it. Get it?

3023
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:47,000
Pipeline is an experiment to see if we can take a group of high school students

3024
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:50,000
with minimal work experience and train them in the skills and methods

3025
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:53,000
necessary to be successful at a company like Valve.

3026
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:57,000
There's nothing there yet besides a video and an FAQ,

3027
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
but hopefully that's going to change in the near future,

3028
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
especially as we get into the new school year, right?

3029
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Here we will teach them to make two highly critical games

3030
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:08,000
and then delay the third one forever,

3031
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:12,000
thus building infinite anticipation for said sequel.

3032
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:15,000
Yes, these high schoolers will be working on Half-Life 3.

3033
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
The next Half-Life 3.

3034
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:24,000
Rama in chat helping to clear up about the Fighting is Magic new game.

3035
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:27,000
Lauren Faust is creating new characters for the game

3036
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:31,000
on the Skullgirls engine that they got for free after the Kickstarter.

3037
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Now I remember that. That's right.

3038
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
Even though they couldn't use those characters,

3039
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
the creator was going to make new characters,

3040
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:40,000
and then the folks behind Skullgirls were really into it.

3041
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:45,000
They're apparently bronies over there at Skullgirls.

3042
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
So that's pretty cool.

3043
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:52,000
Congrats to all you fans who are going to be in that game.

3044
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
I'm sure you guys will be excited about that.

3045
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,000
One last call for calls.

3046
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:59,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

3047
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
I'll check in with Loki one more time

3048
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
and see if there's any other last minute stories or what have you.

3049
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:04,000
I have nothing.

3050
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Nothing? Yeah, that's it for tweets too.

3051
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:07,000
We running out of show?

3052
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
Must be time to stick a nail in it.

3053
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
All right. I guess we're done.

3054
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
The Skype line's not ringing.

3055
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:14,000
It's over.

3056
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Sorry to those that didn't get through.

3057
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:20,000
But, well, I guess maybe I missed you when I was on another call.

3058
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:21,000
I don't know.

3059
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:22,000
But you can always email us.

3060
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.

3061
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
Or Skype could just be working like Skype.

3062
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Yeah, that's true.

3063
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

3064
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Jason in our chat room is piping up saying,

3065
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:35,000
Pipeline isn't going to teach them to make games.

3066
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:39,000
It's going to teach them to make hats, cards, and other trinkets.

3067
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:42,000
You know, this is becoming a more and more popular thing in high schools

3068
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
to take a more trade school approach.

3069
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:47,000
And I honestly, you know, from somebody who just,

3070
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
I've been open about this on the show before.

3071
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
I didn't finish college.

3072
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:55,000
And the reason why is because the industry I was studying at the time

3073
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,000
was radio and television.

3074
03:01:56,000 --> 03:02:00,000
And after interning at, I almost said what network it was

3075
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:01,000
and I really shouldn't.

3076
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:04,000
But interning at a TV station and doing all this, you know,

3077
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:09,000
stuff in the past, I just felt like I wasn't really going to be happy

3078
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
in that, doing that stuff.

3079
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:16,000
So, this show is kind of a byproduct of what I did get out of college,

3080
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:17,000
which I'm very thankful for.

3081
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:21,000
But otherwise, I went into the working world and just worked my way up,

3082
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:22,000
you know.

3083
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
And I think being able to expose high schoolers to like those like really

3084
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:27,000
entry level job skills, I think is a great thing for some people.

3085
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
And I'm not knocking college.

3086
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
College is a great thing for some people.

3087
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:32,000
It just wasn't for me.

3088
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:36,000
I honestly wish that for a lot of fields, especially the one that I'm in,

3089
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:41,000
that it didn't go so much from paying, you know, the $50,000 for college

3090
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:46,000
and went more into, you know, an apprenticeship type environment.

3091
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:49,000
You know, not an unpaid internship because to me that just seems like

3092
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:52,000
some form of required slavery.

3093
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:57,000
But, you know, I think that it should work on, I mean, yeah,

3094
03:02:57,000 --> 03:03:01,000
you need to go to college, like for me, yeah, going to take art history,

3095
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:04,000
going to take anatomy, going to take things are all helpful.

3096
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:07,000
But I think when it comes to actually the industry type of job,

3097
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:10,000
it should be one-on-one working with somebody.

3098
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:14,000
You know, some type of, you know, you work as an apprentice,

3099
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:17,000
you become a journeyman, you know, like back in the day.

3100
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:22,000
Anyhow, I don't want people to misunderstand what we're trying to like say here.

3101
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:25,000
OLR is anti-college. No, that's not it. It's just, you know.

3102
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:26,000
I'm having fun at college.

3103
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:27,000
Yeah.

3104
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:28,000
I'm not going to a four-year yet.

3105
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:31,000
So, there's many different ways to learn.

3106
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:37,000
Anyhow, that about does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3107
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:40,000
I really want to thank you guys for tuning in tonight and supporting the show

3108
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
and supporting independent podcasting.

3109
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:45,000
You know, if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio,

3110
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
please tell a friend or five about the show.

3111
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:50,000
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and help grow our family.

3112
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:51,000
We really appreciate it.

3113
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
Bradley, thank you very much for being here tonight.

3114
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
We didn't get to hear a whole lot from you tonight,

3115
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:56,000
but I hope you had fun here on the show.

3116
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Sure. It was good.

3117
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
And feel free to pop back in any time.

3118
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
It's always a pleasure to have you on.

3119
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Yep, yep.

3120
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:03,000
Next time, we'll play a game or something.

3121
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:06,000
You can actually have a little bit more of a say in or something.

3122
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:10,000
But see you hopefully in less than six months.

3123
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:11,000
Don't be a stranger.

3124
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:14,000
Any final thoughts you want to get out for the listeners?

3125
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:19,000
Well, after this show, I'm going to probably go see Pacific Rim

3126
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:20,000
because that looks pretty cool.

3127
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:25,000
And it is a goddamn travesty that that fucking Adam Sandler movie

3128
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:28,000
outpaced Pacific Rim. I'm so angry.

3129
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
There's so much wrong with America.

3130
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:34,000
Unfortunately, they did not cancel the apocalypse.

3131
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:38,000
Ugh. Horrible. Anyway.

3132
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
Yeah, because there are a lot of dumb people.

3133
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
So, more people need to go see Pacific Rim.

3134
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Do you have anything you want to...

3135
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
You don't really have like a Twitter or anything.

3136
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
Do you have any websites you want to pimp or promote while you're here?

3137
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
You don't really have any of that stuff, do you?

3138
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
No. The only thing I really have that's game related

3139
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
is like I have a backloggery thing.

3140
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Oh, okay.

3141
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:59,000
I don't really have loads of people on that other than some place.

3142
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:02,000
That's a pretty cool place if you want to list your games,

3143
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
but it takes forever to put them in there

3144
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:07,000
because if they don't have any drop down, you have to put it in yourself.

3145
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:10,000
It tells me to keep up with the million things I'm playing.

3146
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
I have like 400 plus. Let me wear it.

3147
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
Oh, my. 400 plus?

3148
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
483 unfinished games.

3149
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:17,000
Oh, my God.

3150
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
And I bought more already.

3151
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
You can really see how far behind you

3152
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:24,000
and how much crap you have on Steam and everything.

3153
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:28,000
Does it make a competition out of like who can catch up on their backlog more?

3154
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:29,000
Does it give you trading cards?

3155
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:30,000
No.

3156
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:31,000
Oh, bummer.

3157
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:37,000
They do have like little icons that show up depending on what you've finished.

3158
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:41,000
Like I have Confused because I have playing 10 plus games at once.

3159
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:45,000
That sounds like me.

3160
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
All right. Well, thanks again for being here.

3161
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:48,000
We'll see you soon.

3162
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
I guess we'll go to Dark Sakura.

3163
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
What's your final thought tonight?

3164
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:57,000
My final thought is I wish I had ice cream.

3165
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:02,000
My final thought tonight is, well, maybe we can give you a Greek yogurt bar.

3166
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:03,000
I mean, it's not ice cream, but.

3167
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
That's okay. Thank you, though.

3168
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:06,000
Thought we'd offer.

3169
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:10,000
My other final thought is Shane is trying to course me into doing a Let's Play tonight

3170
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:14,000
on one of the streaming sites, so be looking for that.

3171
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:19,000
He wants me to play a game called Slender Man, which is a scary game.

3172
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
Why are you laughing over there?

3173
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:22,000
That'll be funny.

3174
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
So apparently that's going to happen later on.

3175
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
But I do have to work tomorrow, so we can't go too late.

3176
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:29,000
So but stay tuned once I get the show up.

3177
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
If I have some time, I'll maybe go to that.

3178
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:32,000
You should just play Surgeon Simulator.

3179
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:33,000
I mean, that's just as funny.

3180
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Is it?

3181
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:37,000
And everybody should buy Surgeon Simulator if you haven't yet.

3182
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:40,000
2013 because it's just stupid.

3183
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
Is it still three bucks or was that the first four bucks?

3184
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:43,000
It's really cheap.

3185
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:46,000
It's like I have it.

3186
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:47,000
I have it in front of me, I think.

3187
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:53,000
Which, by the way, speaking of Let's Play channels, I may be creating my own channel independent of the OLR channel

3188
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:56,000
just because Dar Sakura has her own channel.

3189
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:59,000
And I want to be able to do things that don't necessarily have the OLR name attached to it,

3190
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:03,000
just because, you know, I don't want to be OLRs for all of us.

3191
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:07,000
So we'll have like maybe hopefully I'm hoping we can bring the webcam back.

3192
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:10,000
Streaming the show is in the future and so forth.

3193
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:11,000
But there you go.

3194
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:14,000
Code Man says, can you record it, please?

3195
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
I'm going to try.

3196
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
I don't want to promise tonight.

3197
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:21,000
I feel like I should do a test run of something else tonight and then do Slender Man,

3198
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:27,000
but I am very interested in getting into the YouTube scene of Let's Play.

3199
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:28,000
I'll leave it at that.

3200
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:33,000
I know that the program that you were using before and the one that I'm using still automatically records.

3201
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:34,000
Oh, nice.

3202
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:38,000
I said to make sure I don't have performance suffering because of it, but I shouldn't.

3203
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:39,000
We'll see.

3204
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:40,000
Okay.

3205
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:43,000
Loki, your last, your final thought tonight.

3206
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:46,000
I wish I had no headache.

3207
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:47,000
Oh, you want some ibuprofen?

3208
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:48,000
No, I got it.

3209
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:49,000
I'm going to go home and take them.

3210
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:50,000
All right. I feel better.

3211
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
All right. That does it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3212
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
Thank you guys for tuning in and supporting the show.

3213
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:55,000
We really appreciate it.

3214
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:56,000
Have a great week, everybody.

3215
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

3216
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:59,000
Have a good night.

3217
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:03,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
