Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, July 7th, 2013, two gaming companies find themselves hacked this week.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Xbox One reputation system matching hopes to group trolls with trolls.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And we find out why the Wii Vitality sensor disappeared.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 511 for July the 7th, 2013.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to join you over the next couple hours to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, all things gaming

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and as well as my co-host, one just one right now in studio.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Say hello to Loki, Techmaster Loki here tonight.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How are you doing, Loki?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm doing fine.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I, I, my decision to not get fries was, it paid off, I think.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, you made a, you made a little fast food decision tonight, right?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, yeah, cause I normally go to like fast food and stuff and a lot of times, especially in the evenings and even sometimes during, you know, the lunch hours and stuff,

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
like you go to like McDonald's or something like that and their fries are good when, when they're good.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But there's such a small margin of when they are able to make them good versus just being crap.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And a lot of times, especially at dinner time, it's just, it's garbage.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's just not good at all.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I decided, hey, you know, instead of getting like a double quarter pounder meal large and that kind of stuff and paying like eight bucks,

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I just got two double cheeseburgers and no fries and just a large drink.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And then that ended up being like three bucks and I'm just as full from it.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So I think that's the way to go.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There you go. Saving money, right?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Exactly.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then you don't have crappy, soggy french fries, but I'll tell you what's even worse.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, we do talk about fast food occasionally on the show.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You know what?

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It is what it is.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It is part of the gamer lifestyle.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, if you want to believe, I mean, Mountain Dew and Doritos isn't exactly fast food, but, you know, you get the idea.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But, okay, so the other, just the other day I go to Carl's Jr., which I don't think they have on the East Coast.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I think they call it Hardee's. It's really all the same thing, right?

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So I go there and I get my meal and I get Alan's thing. He gets a combo with fries.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I always get Chris cut fries with my sandwich because I love their Chris cut fries.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They're the bomb.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They're like, you know, they're even better than like the waffle fries and other chains and so forth.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Like, I love them.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So I get the fries and I can, like, smell them in the bag.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm like, mmm, smells like french fries, right?

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Smells so good.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I get all the way home, open the bag.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They gave me regular fries instead of Chris cut fries.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Like, the one reason I go to Carl's Jr., denied.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So mad.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's like you want to just drive back to the building and scream at somebody.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Some poor guy who made a mistake.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But I'm just too lazy and I ate the fries anyway.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What can you do?

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What can you do?

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All right.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Go to our chat room.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The Voice of the Geeks Network.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Live.vognetwork.com.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Queen Simeon chat says, is that what Carl's Jr. is?

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes, it's pretty much Hardee's.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Some people that have had both tell me they're different, but they're...

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I think they serve different things.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Like, their menu's slightly different.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But it's pretty much the same.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They were selling, like, Hardee's biscuits here at one point.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's interesting how all that stuff...

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Just put the same menu on there.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not like people, like, on the East Coast eat so much different things than the people on the West Coast.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's not all that...

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's interesting how fast food really varies.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not like, you know, we're in Hawaii where, you know, beef is not plentiful and there is a lot of spam.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But, you know, it's just...

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't understand why it has to be that different when you have a chain that's on both sides of...

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, and I don't understand why they just won't put In-N-Outs on the East Coast.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Because anytime I have a friend from about...

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What's the furthest In-N-Out goes out?

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think Texas now.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So anything further east than Texas, if they come out here to visit or whatever, it's like, we gotta go to In-N-Out.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We gotta go have In-N-Out.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a good fast food burger, don't get me wrong.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But, you know, I'm like, God, why don't they open one up in New York already?

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's just wanting to get the franchise.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
They're just like, why do we have Dunkin' Donuts over here?

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Amen to that.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But, I mean, I don't know.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There's a lot of reasons, I guess.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's just whether people want to franchise something like that far away.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't know. I thought it'd be kind of cool.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
People are always shocked when I tell them we don't have Dunkin' Donuts here.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We do not have Dunkin' Donuts here, people.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Which sucks because I love their coffee.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I would go there as opposed to Starbucks if I could, even though it's so terrible for you.

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's so good. I can't help it.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Every time I travel, I have to get a Dunkin' Coffee. It's so good.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And then I can't resist and have one of those coconut donuts, too.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Alright, it is a show about video games, and I'm sure you're all wondering,

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
where is the lovely Dark Sakura? Why didn't you introduce her?

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Dark Sakura is running a little late tonight, so she will be here during the show

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
because it is about a three-hour show.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We're anticipating her arrival in about an hour.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The only bummer is that she was going to kick off the show with her talk about Atari Party,

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
which is a local event here in Davis.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And, bummer, I really wanted to go, but it conflicted with something else I have for

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
rehearsals for something coming up, so I couldn't go to Atari Party.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But she went, Dan went, I think Dan is coming here with her.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So they're going to talk about Atari and all the classic things that they saw this week,

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
which I love that stuff because Atari 2600 really was my first gaming system.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Even though I show Commodore 64 a lot of love on this show, and rightly so,

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Atari 2600 really was my first gaming system.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like, you know, I have very fond memories being five years old

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and playing the Spider-Man Atari 2600 video game on my mom's TV,

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
which was just like this little dude that had a red top and blue tights to look like Spider-Man.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You could shoot a web up and you climbed up a building, basically.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I remember there was something with the windows.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There was either bad guys in windows or people you rescued in windows.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't remember. It's been so long since I played.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But, yeah, I used to play that Spider-Man game.

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Did you play Atari 2600 growing up?

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No, I didn't have a 2600.

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, my friends did, but I had a ColecoVision with an Atari adapter.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I had Atari games, but it wasn't necessarily playing through the Atari system.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It was that weird adapter that they had.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I didn't even know they had an adapter.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, it was in that really awkward like,

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
hey, that's kind of infringing on our copyrights type thing, but who cares?

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't have anything to do with copyrights.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I just play the game.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You ever go back and play the old stuff now, like emulators and so forth?

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
See, here's the weird thing for me.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The weird thing about when I play this stuff on emulators is that

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
my gaming attention deficit disorder, which is totally a legit thing I have,

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
gets even worse.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You'll load up an emulated game and I'll play it for literally 15 seconds.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then it says, oh, onto a new game, oh, onto a new game.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's like, I'm going to try everything at the buffet.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But there's something different about doing that

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
versus going to sit and play at the TV and force yourself to sit there at the TV,

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
even if it's, and I know this is really weird,

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
even if it's emulated on the TV like Xbox Game Room.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Perfect example, right?

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Loads of Atari 200 games on Xbox Game Room.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But that shit can hold my attention for a lot longer.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Like playing something like Stampede, which is a grossly simple game, right?

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's just like wrangle up the cows and don't let them get past the left side of the screen.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Like I could sit there and play that shit forever and keep trying to beat my high score and stuff,

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
but when I'm playing it in emulators, it's like, board now, switch, board now, switch.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I remember we played the ColecoVision version of Smurfs

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and we cycled through the whole game like about 20 times one time.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's just like, it just keeps going. It's funny.

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Just this week on, or no, it wasn't this week, but a couple weeks ago on Virtual Console for Wii U,

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Mario Brothers came out, and I'm not talking Super Mario Brothers.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I mean, the original Mario Brothers, which was that one static screen with the pipes and the turtles and the crabs,

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that was on Atari 2600, and we used to play the shit out of that.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My best friend in like second grade and I would play that all the time.

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Thanks to the DS, I'm so burnt out on that game.

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I remember when Mario Brothers was just like,

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hey, it comes with Mario Brothers, every single Mario game that's on the DS comes with Mario Brothers.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can play with your friends, you know, with the Game Share thing because it comes with Mario Brothers.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's like, dude, I don't need to play this game anymore.

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You put it on every single cartridge.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Bobby Blackwolf, our pal from his show that's on right before us here at VOG Network says,

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oink, I loved Oink. I loved that game too, but it's really only good to me as a two player game

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
because if I remember right, I don't remember if it was a really advertised feature,

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
but you could plug in a second joystick and the second person could be the big bad wolf.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And it wasn't in all the Activision collections.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Like it wasn't in some of the ones I remember picking up, but that was a great game on the 2600.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Remember when Activision was like the best games on the system back in the 2600 days?

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Dungeon Buster says, H-E-R-O was also fun. That's one of my all time favorite 2600 games.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I grew up on that with the Commodore 64 first, which has like really improved graphics.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That game was kind of awesome.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
S-H-A-100 Matt says, See, I have gamer ADD, but I have a hard time with MMOs because of it.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I wonder how Rob is able to play MMOs with it.

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The social element of MMOs makes it a lot like you want to improve your character

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
so you can go on adventures with friends like you.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The motivation of having friends to play with is huge.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Like I can sit there on MMO and be chatting on Skype and it's a much kind of different experience

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
than just kind of like a single player with emulators.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Does that make sense?

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I have found lately a lot of my friends are leaving World of Warcraft.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Almost all of my co-hosts on Horde House have left Warcraft.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The one that still plays, Grandpa, plays with his cousins or his family or something now

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
so he doesn't really play with me anymore.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I had a couple friends that were playing for a week.

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Not a lot of people I know are playing it anymore and it's sad because it really kills my motivation to play.

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And there's still a couple people that play and I have some friends in Canada that play

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and I really like them and I like talking to them but they're the only ones anymore that are playing

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and it makes it really hard to motivate myself to kind of get on and you don't want to do anything

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
because I'm like, eh, what am I doing?

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm doing a daily dungeon, pew pew, alliance is dead, wah, moving on to something else.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm falling behind on all these single player games because of the MMOs.

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, that's the thing. It's like there's all these other games and those MMOs take so much of your time

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
that it's just hard to justify wanting to play them.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, I bet they left WoW to play Marvel Heroes.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Not my co-host on Horde House so much but Captain Spike I don't think would mind me outing him from Game Buoy.

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We were playing WoW and he's been playing Marvel Heroes a lot lately which we all played one night.

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It was a lot of fun and now Alan got Marvel Heroes too so I don't know.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That is kind of a thing that's happening right now is Marvel Heroes but for how long?

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Until Final Fantasy XIV comes out in its full form I'm sure.

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Because every beta weekend for Final Fantasy XIV has been kind of that.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But even Final Fantasy XIV I kind of hit a wall with this week.

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I hit one of those single player, I know I'm getting into my gaming week a little bit but oh well.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I hit one of those single player missions you have to do in Final Fantasy XIV and it was kind of like,

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I just kind of got frustrated with it and I was like, you know what?

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm going to go play some single player games I need to catch up on because I have extensively beta tested this game.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I've given my feedback. What am I doing?

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm getting frustrated over this quest where my character is just going to get wiped in a couple days anyway when the next beta phase begins.

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So I'm going to wait at this point for the non-erased character beta which is the next open beta.

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The characters you create in open beta will carry over to the live game.

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So I'm just waiting for that at this point.

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I, uh, that game man, I don't know.

214
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I was playing it yesterday and it's just one of those things like, you know, I leveled up to 11.

215
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I've been basically soloing everything because I don't know how to party and everybody that we kind of talk to,

216
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
they're never on or I don't see them or I don't have them friended or something.

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And so it's like, well this is kind of okay I guess.

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And then at the same time I'm like, I don't know if I want to keep playing this because I know I'm not going to play this in the future.

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Then at the same time I'm like, well I kind of want to play it, but at the same time I don't want to play it.

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Because there are all these good games that I want to come out, you know, Grand Theft Auto for sure.

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I mean, I want to play that more online than I want to play Final Fantasy.

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But, you know, I like Final Fantasy, it's just, I don't know, I'm torn.

223
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
A lot of people talking, about one million people registered for Final Fantasy XIV beta.

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's going to be very interesting to see how that goes over once the sub-fee is kicking.

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because I think a lot of people are just playing it as a demo right now, but sub-fees means, you know, you got to pay up if you want to keep going.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We'll see, it's going to be interesting.

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Raginator in chat says, Rob Roberts, I'm probably in the minority here, but I always thought that Game Room was underappreciated.

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I love it.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Raginator, have you heard the show? I was a huge proponent of Game Room. I loved it.

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I was, I'm actually like legit pissed off that Microsoft really dropped the ball with it.

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And, you know, they let everybody go at Chrome and all that stuff.

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Like, it actually pissed me off that they were out there promising thousands of games and nothing ever came of that.

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Because Game Room, Game Room did what Virtual Console needs to do.

234
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I realized when it came to setting up your little rooms and so forth, that that feature was a little bit gimped.

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But whatever, when it came to the game playing itself, the live leaderboards was great.

236
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The replays was great.

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Being able to send challenges to your friends was great.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Like, that's all stuff that Nintendo's Virtual Console would greatly benefit from and would have a great enhanced value from.

239
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And it's a great way to modernize classic games.

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I realized there's purists out there that are like, you know what, nothing matches the old school.

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Get my Atari 2600 with its coaxial cable to a TV that won't even get channels anymore because of the digital switch.

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And I totally respect that.

243
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And that's totally part of the point of a thing like Atari Party is for like-minded people to get together and play that stuff, I'm sure.

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Or at least Jamie can give us insight to that later.

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But I liked Game Room as a modern experience of classic games.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I'm really pissed that Microsoft didn't try to invest a little more into it.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I can't imagine it was this horrific expense.

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Like, they weren't writing new games.

249
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Now, granted, they were probably having to go back and tweak an awful lot to get them to work and so forth.

250
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But really, were they just not selling anything?

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Then, I don't know, maybe there's other questions you need to ask yourself.

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But yeah, I was a huge proponent of Game Room.

253
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And I'm pissed it didn't work.

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I'm pissed we probably won't get anything like it on Xbox One.

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Or anything. You know? It sucks.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm surprised we haven't seen PlayStation Home on the PlayStation 4.

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Like, I would have thought that would have been kind of cool to step up everything.

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Or maybe they just didn't really work out, I guess.

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They didn't do what they wanted to do with it.

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, PlayStation Home definitely has its cult...

261
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm not saying that in a negative context. Like a cult movie.

262
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
PlayStation Home has its cult following.

263
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And we've had some of that on this show.

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We participated with one of the home events.

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It was a lot of fun to see that community.

266
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're right. It is weird that they didn't mention that going to the PlayStation 4.

267
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't know if... I would have thought it was profitable enough with the microtransactions and everything.

268
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It was basically Second Life on a console and it seemed to be doing well enough in itself.

269
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But do you think that maybe they could...

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, I guess not because of the chipset.

271
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I was thinking in my mind, could they just carry PlayStation Home over to PlayStation 4?

272
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But I guess not for the same reason it's not backwards compatible.

273
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They changed the core chipset.

274
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, maybe streaming. Who knows?

275
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Alright, well anyhow.

276
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That was a very random potpourri sort of kickoff topic.

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But let's talk about the video games that we've actually been playing this week.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Besides just Final Fantasy XIV, apparently.

279
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Final Fantasy XIV. Unfortunately, that's all that I played this week.

281
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Just... I only played a few hours of it, actually.

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Just the other day, just leveling my Thaumaturge.

283
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And I kept trying to solo stuff.

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's so really weird how you can party but not party.

285
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
People can help you.

286
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If you're fighting something, someone else can join in and fight the same monster.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And you still get the experience from it.

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Even though you're not partying.

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Which is odd. I don't know why they have that.

290
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But it's neat.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It is a little frustrating.

292
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There was a monster chasing somebody and I was trying to pull it off of them.

293
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And the monster was invulnerable.

294
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And it got in this weird loop where he would run towards me and then run away.

295
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And then he'd run back towards me and then run away.

296
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And kind of kept going that way back and forth.

297
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I guess that was a bug or something.

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah, it's a beta. It might have been a bug.

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But I've seen the invulnerable thing happen.

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Like when the person who pulled it loses all the threat.

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like they run out of range or whatever.

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The mob retreats and during that time it's invincible.

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Same thing happens in WoW actually.

304
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It'll evade in WoW.

305
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's kind of nice.

306
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The only thing I don't like about that though is I'll try to pull a mob.

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then try to use the landscape at my advantage.

308
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And it wasn't even that far away.

309
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I was on a bridge and I was trying to attack fish.

310
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And the fish couldn't figure out how to turn the corner to the bridge or something.

311
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And so it kept going invulnerable.

312
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And I couldn't do any damage to it even though I was well within range.

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's just stupid I guess.

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't know. It was kind of annoying.

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Did you play around with any of the crafting professions?

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No.

317
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I did a little bit of that this week.

318
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's interesting.

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's different.

320
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's not just put the pieces together and craft.

321
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There's a little bit of strategy that comes into play on will you get a high quality item or not.

322
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How does that work?

323
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Your item as you craft it has durability.

324
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And so let's say you'll get four attempts.

325
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You can do four moves on it.

326
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And you can either craft and it might take two of your attempts to craft it.

327
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But as you level in a profession you'll get things that are like you get a 70% chance to enhance the percentage of possibility it will be a high quality item.

328
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Or you get a move that will restore all of the durability but at great cost.

329
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's just interesting. All your abilities become part of the balancing game of trying to craft the item without breaking it and losing all your stuff.

330
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's not just throw them all together and click craft.

331
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I like that they changed it up a little.

332
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah I was just basically doing the regular quests in the game and then just grinding I guess.

333
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I mean that's really all I could do.

334
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I went back into town to get some more quests because the storyline doesn't seem to be progressing.

335
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Because I'm not sure maybe I'm just not doing something right.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Let's be honest I'm not really reading any of the story either.

337
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm just skipping through all of it because if they really want me to pay attention to something they'll have a cutscene.

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It ends up happening usually.

339
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I still know what the story is and I don't really care.

340
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I just want to get to a point where...

341
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't know if it's just in the beta.

342
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I guess if you get to a certain point where you're level 20 you can actually level all your other subs to 15.

343
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That'll only be in the beta but yes.

344
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And probably not carrying over to open beta.

345
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh well.

346
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But once you get to level 15 they did finally implement the duty finder.

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Not duty finder but duty finder.

348
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Which basically they're looking for group tool.

349
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So you can do dungeons and that fun stuff.

350
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Which wasn't really a thing in Final Fantasy XI.

351
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But that's a huge wow thing obviously.

352
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I haven't really explored too far either.

353
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I've just been around the town so I don't know how to get anywhere.

354
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh yeah you gotta get out there and explore.

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Well everything's trying to kill me.

356
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Keep doing story quests and around level 15 you get an airship pass.

357
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And you go to the other towns as part of a quest.

358
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's pretty cool.

359
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Alright well if that's it for your gaming week.

360
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll talk about my gaming week a little bit besides Final Fantasy XIV.

361
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I kind of just needed a break from MMOs this week.

362
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I played Final Fantasy XIV extensively on Friday and Saturday.

363
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But then I needed a break.

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So I played some other stuff.

365
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
On Wii U Virtual Console I played Mario Brothers as I talked about before.

366
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I also played Pilot Wings because that came out on Virtual Console on July 4th.

367
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And who did not love the game that was made basically to show off Mode 7.

368
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And it was a great game.

369
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Who doesn't love Rocket Bell?

370
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What is it called? Rocket Pack? Rocket Bell?

371
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's a lot of fun to play as skydiving and all that stuff.

372
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And making the characters really angry or upset when you do really bad.

373
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But yeah the Mode 7 is fun.

374
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
One thing that at least the Wii U Virtual Console does that the Wii Virtual Console didn't do.

375
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Is that you can take the screenshots and post them to Miiverse.

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And now as of like the end of June you can post those Miiverse posts to Twitter and stuff.

377
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So I've been doing that a little bit at my Twitter.

378
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If I can talk. Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E is my Twitter. Sky. S-K-I-E.

379
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And I've been posting some random things.

380
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Like I posted a funny picture of one of the Pilot Wings people getting mad at me.

381
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And like this funny thing I did in Mario Brothers where I had two of the turtles facing each other.

382
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So it looked like they were talking to each other.

383
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I like being able to post the screenshots to Miiverse.

384
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So if you want to follow me on Nintendo Network.

385
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm Rob Roberts on Nintendo Network.

386
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I will post more hilarity when I can. When I'm feeling funny.

387
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So I've been doing that on Nintendo.

388
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Otherwise on PC I suddenly got unexplainably addicted to Steam trading cards.

389
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't know why. I don't have a good reason for it.

390
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I just said this is something I want.

391
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You mean I can get silly loot like new backgrounds and experience that means nothing.

392
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And possibly coupons. I guess that's something.

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
From doing this trading card game. Metagame in Steam.

394
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yes I must do this.

395
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So here's the thing though.

396
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The game kind of makes no sense when you hear it at first.

397
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So let me explain it for you.

398
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Best I can. Best I know about it.

399
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
First off. First things first. You have to get this out of your head.

400
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Trading cards are not tied to achievements.

401
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Achievements have nothing to do with trading cards. They are separate.

402
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So get that out of your head. Break that link.

403
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
First mistake people make. They think the two are tied together. They're not. Completely separate.

404
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So certain games have trading cards.

405
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And there might be five in a set. There might be nine in a set. There might be seven.

406
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
There's anywhere from five to nine it looks like from the games I've played.

407
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Now there's two different systems in a game that you paid for.

408
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Like Super Meat Boy.

409
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Magica.

410
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Binding of Isaac.

411
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
In a game that you paid for. Every time you start the game.

412
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And play it for about twenty, thirty minutes.

413
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And log out. You get a trading card.

414
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Up to half the number that are in the deck.

415
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
In other words.

416
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Super Meat Boy is probably one of the smallest decks that has five cards in it.

417
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You can get three of them by playing Super Meat Boy.

418
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Once you've gotten all the cards. You can get repeats though which sucks.

419
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
In Faerie Solitaire I've gotten three of the same card which is really irritating.

420
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But. And you don't. Like if you are only eligible. I think I'm eligible for five out of nine in Faerie Solitaire.

421
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Except three of my five are all the same. So I'm going to have to do some big time trading.

422
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So what happens once you get half?

423
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You become eligible for booster packs.

424
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Which are handed out. This is the part I don't quite have figured out yet. Maybe somebody in chat can help.

425
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It seems to be arbitrary.

426
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Like you might get them in a day. You might get them in a week.

427
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But you have to log into Steam every week in order to be eligible for the booster packs.

428
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And my understanding is that booster packs spawn as people complete their sets.

429
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And you have a greater chance to get a booster pack if your Steam experience is higher.

430
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Like your Steam level 10. Your Steam level 20. Which you can get from the games you own.

431
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The previous sales. And all this other stuff.

432
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So once you get the booster packs then you open them up and maybe you'll finish your set through a booster pack.

433
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Which then you can combine your set and tada! You get your badge and you get a new profile background.

434
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
A new emote icon. Just a bunch of really cosmetic stuff.

435
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But still kind of a little more than what achievements get you, right?

436
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And possibly a coupon. Like I saw one YouTube where a guy opened it up and he got a 50% off Company Heroes or something.

437
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
One of those games coupon. Which I thought, oh that's cool because that's more trading fodder later.

438
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Like I could use that to trade for a card. Like I'm never going to buy this game.

439
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Why don't you give me your Super Meat Boy card and I'll give you my 50% off coupon for this game.

440
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So Steam's created this very interesting thing about it. I kind of wish there was a little more to it than just the play the game.

441
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh! I missed free to play. For games like Dota, Team Fortress, you don't get the cards for playing.

442
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You get the cards for spending money in the online shop.

443
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Like for every, I think it's $9 or $10 you spend in the shop, you get a card.

444
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So I'm not so focused on those because I don't really play any of those.

445
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The only free to play game I play through Steam regularly right now is Marvel Heroes and they don't have cards.

446
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But I've been going back, you know, I've got over 100 Steam games thanks to these bundles and bundles I accumulated in Steam sales.

447
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh my god! Steam sale coming!

448
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah, a lot of the old stuff.

449
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
ActDeft correcting me in chat saying you can only get them once per week.

450
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I did not know that.

451
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And ActDeft says you can also buy cards and boosters from the Steam Community Marketplace.

452
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh boy, see? They've created this whole game where you're spending money to get that one card.

453
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm going to try not to go that route. I'm going to really try to do this the old-fashioned way.

454
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I haven't gotten any booster packs yet because I just got into it this weekend.

455
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But I've collected like, I have three Super Meat Boy cards, three Really Big Sky cards, three Faerie Solitaire cards, one Magica card.

456
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And that'll tell you what else I've been playing with my gaming week.

457
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So let me quickly run down some of these other games.

458
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Super Meat Boy. Plug in a controller and use it on the PC. It's just as fun as the Xbox 360 version and it's still fun to play.

459
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's a great game to play for a few minutes.

460
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You play a few minutes, beat a few rounds, you feel accomplished, get frustrated on a level, whatever, close it, come back later.

461
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Really Big Sky is a twin-stick shooter that came out I think at the end of last year.

462
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I like it but it's not my favorite twin-stick shooter.

463
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And part of the reason I don't like it is that, well for one, I get really bad performance issues when there's too much stuff on screen on my PC.

464
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I probably need to play with the graphics settings and so forth.

465
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But I think it starts to become too much.

466
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Like the graphics are just too much and I can't tell things apart and it just looks like explosion mania.

467
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And I really didn't like how retro mode was just this really silly filter and a chiptune song.

468
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Like it was not retro mode at all. I did not like that.

469
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But those are really the only, I know I'm sounding very negative about this game but it is a fun game especially if you like shooters.

470
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And the soundtrack is phenomenal. I really like that.

471
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Also been playing The Binding of Isaac which is kind of rogue.

472
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
A lot of people say it's Legend of Zelda but it doesn't play like Zelda.

473
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It plays like a twin-stick shooter.

474
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But it's always randomly generated which is interesting.

475
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's a little bit out there as far as the story goes.

476
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And it's one of those things you're like, you play it and you're like, you know, not all games are art.

477
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Cause this one's a little weird.

478
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You got like monsters that leave poop everywhere that's part of a mechanic.

479
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And you find these really odd things that you're, cause you know the plot of the story is that your mom is trying to kill you.

480
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That's the plot of The Binding of Isaac.

481
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And you find all this really weird stuff.

482
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's kind of a creepy game. I'm only playing that as much as I have to to get cards.

483
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I like the idea of a roguelike that does the randomly generated stuff. There's a ton of those games out there.

484
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And then Magica. I like that.

485
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That's kind of like a puzzle-y type game where you can combine different magics together to get to.

486
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It reminds me of an old school PC game from like the late 90's.

487
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Where you, you know, you put things together to get to pass this part of a level.

488
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Like you might mix fire and stone magic together to throw a fire boulder.

489
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Or you use ice magic to freeze a lake.

490
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And make all these clever spells.

491
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And it's got a co-op mode that's supposedly a lot of fun.

492
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But I haven't really played a lot of the co-op mode.

493
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So, anyhow.

494
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I've been talking to your ear off about Steam and all that.

495
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But the trading card thing is, I like that it gives me reason to go back and play these games that I probably didn't sink enough time into.

496
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Like I played Binding of Isaac before.

497
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But I didn't play it enough to understand just how fucking disturbed it is, you know?

498
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Now I understand a little better.

499
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And same thing with Magica and Fairy Solitaire and some of that.

500
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You know, I played enough Fairy Solitaire to get the game.

501
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But now I've really gotten to parts where it starts to just really get irritatingly difficult.

502
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So, there you go. That's been my time with Steam this week.

503
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
AlphaCananagram in chat in reference to the Binding of Isaac says,

504
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I only heard it is just like it is Zelda due to the dungeon format.

505
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah, and the bombs and the keys.

506
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But honestly, the way it plays as a game is a little more similar to Rogue and like a twin-stick shooter.

507
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Even though you can only shoot in the four directions.

508
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But weird things happen. Like you'll find these pills.

509
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And you won't know what the pills do until you try using them once.

510
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm almost positive that was a mechanic in Rogue.

511
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You didn't know what stuff did until you used it for once.

512
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And some of the pills will give you just derpy face.

513
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And it goes, I found a pill and I ate it.

514
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Some will teleport you to a random room. Some will enhance your health.

515
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
One of them is a suicide pill.

516
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You take it, you die. Game over. One life. That's it.

517
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Game over, you start again from the beginning.

518
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That's like some Dark Souls level difficulty.

519
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Alright, let's move on.

520
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Housekeeping. Don't forget to visit us on Twitter.

521
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. And we are also on Facebook, of course.

522
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
At Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

523
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Just got a text from DarkSakura. She's on her way.

524
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So we'll hopefully be seeing her in about 20 more minutes.

525
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But in the meantime, we're going to keep on moving with the show.

526
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And get into gaming news tonight.

527
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Loki, start us off with one I'm sure you've all heard.

528
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Don Mattrick has left Xbox.

529
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He was originally the president of the...

530
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I believe their entertainment business division.

531
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And now he is going to become the president of Zynga.

532
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So that's interesting, I guess.

533
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm not really sure why he did...

534
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I mean, I can think of a few reasons why he might have done that.

535
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But the kind of general consensus out there is that he's jumping from a sinking ship to a ship that's on fire and in the water somehow.

536
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I think I saw that exact comic strip you're referencing.

537
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, it was a ship on fire and a ship being eaten by a shark or something.

538
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I don't want to sound like a know-it-all, but I can't resist in bringing up the fact that just two weeks ago on this show, after the big E3 thing, what did I say about Don Mattrick?

539
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What did I say, Loki? You remember?

540
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You said that he was going to be on the chopping block, I guess.

541
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I said he would take the fall and he'd be gone within 365 days.

542
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And just like the Xbox reversal thing, which happened in like three days, the Don Mattrick thing happened a lot faster than anticipated.

543
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
But here's the kicker. I actually don't think he was forced out the door.

544
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
No, I don't think so.

545
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But I think Don Mattrick, I mean, he's the executive of a...

546
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Oh, he's now the CEO of a large company, whether you like it or not.

547
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It at one time was a profitable company.

548
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I think he saw what happened at E3, he saw what everybody was talking about, he saw this opportunity, and he took it.

549
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And I think it was one of those things where it's like, you know, if the Xbox One doesn't do well this holiday season, do I want to be left with no job?

550
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Or do I take this job where maybe I can actually turn things around?

551
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It is a heck of an opportunity and it could be a great way for him anyway to repair his image.

552
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I mean, let's imagine he does turn Zynga around.

553
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And I know a lot of people are ready to pile poop on this.

554
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
They're like, yay, poopy executive meets poopy company.

555
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Go live in your poopy world together making poopville.

556
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But I don't know if I really see it that way because these are two...

557
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You've got a company in a pretty bad situation, you've got an executive that was in a pretty bad situation.

558
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Maybe they can help each other more than they can hurt each other.

559
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And maybe this actually won't end up being the end of the world.

560
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I mean, why do we hate on Zynga?

561
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Why have we hated on Zynga in the past?

562
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
What are people's complaints with Zynga?

563
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
They seem to skirt around IP rights by mimicking as much as they can of a game without outright copy.

564
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I mean, they need sometimes outright copy, but they change enough to where they can't get sued, I guess.

565
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Or they can't get sued and lose.

566
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
They'll change things around slightly, but they'll keep...

567
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Because you can't copyright those core mechanics, so let's just rip them all out and take a popular game and make a clone of it.

568
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And then people will play because it's got Zynga on it.

569
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Now, let me ask you this question.

570
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What does it take to change a company that's heading in that direction?

571
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
What does that take?

572
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Well, it's not just that. They've had problems where they were buying up other companies and they're spending a lot of money doing that and they weren't making their money back.

573
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Okay. What will it take to change that?

574
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Someone with good business sense.

575
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
A new executive. New blood. A big change. A big change.

576
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And that's what Zynga's got, is they've got a big change.

577
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So now I think Don Mattrick and Zynga are really in a position to help each other.

578
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
We can speculate to the cows come home what that's going to mean.

579
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And I know a lot of people joke, her perp is always online. Her perp one meets another.

580
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Don Mattrick did not come up with always online all by his lonesome self, y'all.

581
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But maybe there's some interesting stuff that could come of this. I don't know.

582
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Like, maybe Zynga will separate itself from Facebook a little bit.

583
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That's the part that's exciting to me. At least Don Mattrick wasn't from Facebook.

584
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Maybe Zynga will start to appear on consoles with games that aren't ripoffs of other stuff.

585
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Like some casually interesting things.

586
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I think one of the things you're going to see with the Xbox One, and that's the whole reason why they have that Windows 8 section of the OS,

587
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
is that you're going to see all these apps that are being developed to run on Windows 8 are going to be able to run on the Xbox One.

588
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So if they have, say, a Farmville app that runs on Windows 8, I'm not sure if it's going to be just necessarily the RT or if it's just the actual x86 Windows 8,

589
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,000
that these will probably be easily ported if not able to run natively on the Xbox One.

590
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So you could see these casual games coming to a game console, that and any other sort of app that people make.

591
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And that, very well, that may be why they're not really pushing the whole self-publishing thing because they're like,

592
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
well, you published on Windows 8 on that marketplace and then you can publish on the Xbox One as well.

593
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And that's how they'll try to get people to make more apps for Windows 8 because they need apps on that marketplace in order to make Windows 8 seem appealing.

594
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Because kind of like what they have with the App Store on Mac, they need to have the content there in order to drive it.

595
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

596
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Rama says, I don't hate Zynga. All they're doing is playing the business game like a boss.

597
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
ShadowNextGen says, Rob, Matric's image isn't tarnished except for the internet vocal minority.

598
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
When it was announced that Matric was joining Zynga, Zynga's stock jumped up.

599
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I think you're minimalizing the negativity that came out of E3 a little bit.

600
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Now, how much of that is tied to Matric versus not? That could be argued a little bit.

601
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't think you can blame one person for the whole Xbox stuff anyway.

602
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I don't, but again, like I said two weeks ago, someone's going to take the fall for it.

603
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I don't know if anyone's taken the fall yet for it. He may have just jumped ship.

604
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I was going to mention, though, that they're going to have...

605
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Well, I want to say the second half of this comment here.

606
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
When it was announced that Matric was joining Zynga, Zynga's stock jumped up.

607
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Well, exactly. How can things get worse at Zynga?

608
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And let's not belittle that Don Matric did have a lot of success at Microsoft.

609
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Xbox 360's done very well.

610
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So, I think a lot of people see it as, you know, this can only help things.

611
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Sure, maybe he had a bad week, but at the end of the day, Zynga's in the shitter.

612
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And maybe Don Matric can help bring them out of that at least.

613
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And that would be a great thing. And sure, sure, I think a lot of investors saw that too.

614
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Hey, you know, if Zynga's looking to get some games on the Xbox One or something,

615
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
it might help to have somebody that used to be working for Microsoft to kind of build those bridges.

616
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
There were gonna... One other thing, I guess, Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft,

617
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:59,000
he's considering, I guess, Julie Larson-Green, who is, I guess, the current Windows CEO or whatever

618
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
to take over the Xbox division.

619
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So, when she's quite experienced, I guess, she did product launches for Windows 7

620
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,000
and helped design some of the user interface stuff for the Office products.

621
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Not the newer ones, but 2003, 2007, which I thought were sane.

622
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And then 2010 came around, it's like, what the fuck is this?

623
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So, yeah, I'll be interested in seeing how that affects anything.

624
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't think... A lot of these people in these positions, I don't think have a lot...

625
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Because it seems like it doesn't change too much.

626
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Like, you get a new CEO, all of a sudden it's not radically different.

627
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's just... I don't know, we'll see.

628
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
They have a game plan, they're sticking to it, so...

629
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says,

630
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Larson-Green headed up the Windows 8 group after the last head left.

631
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Well, when did the last head leave?

632
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
See, I haven't been following the Windows 8 drums.

633
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I just know that the launch of Windows 8, not so great,

634
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
but they really seem to be making things right with this 8.1 patch,

635
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
and it seems a lot more exciting this time than the original launch of Windows 8.

636
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It seems like they've got, like...

637
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's like they get this market research or something about what people want,

638
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and then they make it that way, but they don't...

639
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's like they don't quite get it 100%.

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's like, people want tablets.

641
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Let's make an OS for tablets and put it on a PC.

642
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's like, uh-huh?

643
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Tigerclaw in our chat says,

644
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Who do you think should replace Don Mattrick when going up on stage

645
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
at next year's E3 press conference?

646
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Well, I mean, if this rumbling is true, it would be Julie Larson-Green,

647
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
which, you know, I don't know much about this particular executive,

648
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I have to say, but however, you know, silly this might sound...

649
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Steve Ballmer.

650
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Well, it could be Steve Ballmer, but I...

651
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
He yells a lot.

652
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I like the girl power that Microsoft's showing a little bit here, you know?

653
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I think it would be a great thing for a female to be taking the lead on this,

654
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
especially, you know, after there were some very shameful things

655
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
that came out of Microsoft's press conference,

656
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
whether it was intended or not, it was shameful.

657
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I think that would be...

658
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I mean, Microsoft's got this executive possibly coming in.

659
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The one that used to work for CBS

660
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
is now the head of the Microsoft Entertainment Group.

661
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The head of 343 Studios is female.

662
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I think that's great.

663
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm all for that type of diversity.

664
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So, you know, at least there's that,

665
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
is it will bring a little more diversity,

666
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
but I don't know this gal's credentials

667
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
or what else she brings to the table outside of that.

668
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But I think we'll be learning a lot more about her

669
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
if it's true that she is going to be taking over Microsoft's entertainment division.

670
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
We'll see.

671
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So, all right.

672
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Anyhow, I guess we'll move on with news, yes?

673
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yes.

674
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Moving on to a story about Xbox One,

675
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and since we've been talking a lot about Windows 8,

676
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and I guess if they're bringing in the Windows 8 executive,

677
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
this might make a lot of sense here.

678
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Microsoft Builds Developers Conference last week

679
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
talked about what could be Xbox One compatibility for Windows 8 apps,

680
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and I think you were mentioning this a little bit too, Loki.

681
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah, I completely didn't realize.

682
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I actually listened to part of the Build thing, too.

683
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
There was some news out of it that was kind of exciting, but...

684
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Well, let me read at least some of the quotes here

685
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
when we can further talk about this here.

686
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Steve Guggenheimer, who is the VP of Developer and Platform Evangelism,

687
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I don't know if that's a word this website used.

688
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I can't imagine that's a title,

689
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
but he talked about how folks that would like to start on Xbox One development

690
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
should start on Windows 8 applications because, quote,

691
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Xbox One has two engines.

692
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It's got a gaming engine, and it essentially has a Windows 8 engine.

693
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And then he showed a web application that was running on Xbox One.

694
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Nothing to announce today,

695
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
but when I talk about that common core,

696
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
you're seeing that common core in action being able to target other devices

697
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
over time that run the Windows 8 engine.

698
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Hmm.

699
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah, and I already kind of...

700
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
They sort of alluded to that anyways

701
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
when they were talking about how their OS is set up,

702
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
how it's three OSes basically on top of each other.

703
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You have the Windows 8 OS, the Xbox One OS,

704
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and then the one that kind of makes them talk to each other, I guess.

705
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The arbitrator OS.

706
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Black Wolf corrects me in chat saying,

707
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
yes, it is an actual Microsoft title.

708
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Strange, but okay.

709
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I mean, it makes sense. I get it.

710
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I just, you know, when I think of evangelists,

711
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I think of the guys on, you know, PTL on television.

712
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
One of the things that was kind of exciting,

713
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
because now you know how they don't have really X and A anymore.

714
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's kind of gone by the wayside.

715
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
They did announce a partnership with Unity

716
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
where they're going to be allowing porting

717
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
where you can make Xbox One games with Unity.

718
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
That's going to have that built-in support as well,

719
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
so that's kind of cool.

720
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And I think they're going to have PlayStation 4 support as well,

721
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
so that's kind of...

722
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I don't know if it's necessarily replacing X and A,

723
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
but that may be the new route to go, I guess.

724
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, I was going to say, how useful is it

725
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
for Windows 8 apps to be on Xbox One when you can't self-publish?

726
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But that's the thing, is they may have that,

727
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
where it's going to have access to the App Store that's on PC,

728
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
but they're going to say,

729
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
well, you can't publish a game on Xbox One,

730
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
but you can publish an app on the App Store

731
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and have access to Xbox One,

732
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
or the Xbox One users will have access to it.

733
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Maybe that's how they're going to get around it.

734
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You know, when I'm thinking to myself,

735
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm like, what types of apps could we be talking about here?

736
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Are we talking about things like calendar management apps on Xbox One?

737
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Like anything.

738
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Because when I think of apps, like on 360,

739
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
outside of games, they have a lot of web video players.

740
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It seems like everything is some type of video player.

741
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I can't think of a whole lot of stuff on 360

742
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
that's not some type of video player for some network or some website.

743
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I have this weird feeling that that's somehow going to be

744
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
some sort of entry point for hacking right there,

745
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
allowing these applications that can be run on the App Store.

746
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Because I can think of someone

747
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
that could somehow sneak something in there.

748
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Oh, yeah, something that gets stealthily loaded,

749
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
like how MAME got on the Apple Store.

750
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
They loaded it as one of the freeware ROMs.

751
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I think it was called Gridly or something was the game.

752
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's an arcade game that went freeware.

753
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
People released it a long time ago.

754
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So they put that app on the marketplace.

755
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Well, hidden underneath it was a MAME emulator.

756
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And as long as you could get it from the Apple Store

757
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
in the window before they caught it,

758
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
all you have to do is use one of those programs

759
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
that let you browse the file structure on your phone.

760
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You just throw ROMs in the directory.

761
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You got MAME on your iPad and iPhone,

762
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
which works great with that little iCade I have sitting over there,

763
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
just for the record.

764
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Tigerclaw in chat says,

765
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
like, how about a VOG app for Xbox One?

766
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm sure Bobby is wincing, kind of thinking about all the work

767
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
it would take to make something like that.

768
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Loki is learning how to program.

769
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Maybe he can take that project.

770
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Well, here's the thing. I don't think that's necessary anymore

771
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
because nowadays, let's hope that their Internet Explorer

772
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
has HTML5 support.

773
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It should be able to support the website natively.

774
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You'd be able to just use the website.

775
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So it's not necessary to create a dedicated app for that stuff anymore

776
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
because browsers are smart enough now

777
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
to where they can run all that content.

778
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You know, before, they couldn't, so you had to build some.

779
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Gameguru in chat says,

780
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Unity is going to be the indie platform.

781
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
We shall see.

782
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I've been hearing a lot of good things about it, though.

783
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

785
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Let's move on.

786
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I guess I'll do this story here.

787
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Jamie was going to talk about this,

788
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
but she's still a few minutes away, it sounds like.

789
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I will cover this here.

790
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It's a game called...

791
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Is it Ittle-Doo?

792
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It's Ittle-Doo.

793
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That'll do, kid.

794
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Ittle-Doo. I-T-T-L-E-Doo.

795
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Ittle-Doo is now out on the PC.

796
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Ittle-Doo, they say, is a kind of Zelda-esque adventure title.

797
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's very cartoony.

798
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It's by Swedish studio Ludosity.

799
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It sells for 9.40 euros.

800
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That's $13.99.

801
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It's kind of like Zelda, but it has its own cartoon aesthetic,

802
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and it has a lot of self-referential humor.

803
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, I like the games that break down the fourth wall.

804
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That's always a lot of fun.

805
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It pokes fun at itself as your little shipwrecked character

806
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and her flying fox, Tipsy,

807
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
go around terrorizing the island's inhabitants

808
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
and stealing their wealth and eating their hearts.

809
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
That doesn't sound very good unless we're talking, like, flashy hearts like Zelda.

810
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Well, Ittle-Doo will also be on Mac and Steam and Wii U,

811
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Linux, iPad, and Android later this year.

812
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
If you get it now, you'll get the Steam, Mac, and Linux ports on their release.

813
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And Ouya.

814
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Oh, and Ouya.

815
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I wasn't hearing the story, but...

816
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Oh, I see. It's on Twitter and it's in review right now.

817
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Very cool.

818
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
They review games that go on the Ouya?

819
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
That's news.

820
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I don't know what it says.

821
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Probably before it goes on the official marketplace, I would think so.

822
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Yeah, that's good enough.

823
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
If you want to see some of the games,

824
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
there are some Let's Plays available on YouTube

825
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
if you want to see the game in action.

826
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Sounds cute.

827
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I would like to check it out, especially if there's a little demo,

828
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I can get a sample of it,

829
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
but I guess there's always a Let's Play if nothing else.

830
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You can kind of check out a little bit about what that game's about.

831
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Jamie must have earmarked that

832
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
because that's something she's taken interest in,

833
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
so we'll ask her when she gets here.

834
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
But for now, let's move on.

835
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So, Ubisoft got hacked.

836
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Uh oh.

837
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah.

838
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So, you know, apparently an unnamed Ubisoft website,

839
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
they were hacked,

840
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
and the usernames, email addresses, and password information

841
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
have all been compromised.

842
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Thankfully, there's no sort of payment data in there,

843
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
but still, you know, you share passwords with Uplay or something like that,

844
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
you may want to change them.

845
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So, they didn't say that they...

846
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It says the tag did not originate via any Uplay services.

847
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
The intrusion targets some of our internal online systems,

848
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
and I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but whatever.

849
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
All the more reason why I don't like, you know,

850
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
signing up for these different services.

851
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Although, I guess now I'm going to have to sign up for Origin

852
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
if I want to play Battlefield 3 now, aren't I?

853
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Ugh.

854
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I mean, well, on PS3, I think, right?

855
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Because you have to do that for Mass Effect, right?

856
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah, you have to do it for Mass Effect.

857
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
God damn it.

858
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Well, whatever.

859
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I think I still have an old EA account that's probably out there anyways.

860
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It just sucks that you have to have all these different passwords,

861
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
and I know there's app solutions and password wallets and things,

862
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
but I'm going to be honest,

863
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and maybe I shouldn't be saying this in my public radio show, but whatever.

864
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I kind of have a pool of different passwords I pick from.

865
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
My bank account has one password that is very hard.

866
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It's just the most secure type of password.

867
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You can't figure it out, and I don't use it for anything else.

868
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
But sites like Uplay or signing up for random web forum here or there,

869
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
especially if there's no finances tied to it,

870
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I use one password for pretty much all that stuff.

871
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's like whatever.

872
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
No big deal if you lose it.

873
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Oh no, someone's going to take over my account on Minecraft forum or something.

874
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Pretty much anything that could potentially have my credit card information on it,

875
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I have to basically do a unique password for.

876
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But I have my own little system.

877
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I don't want to say much more than that, but I have a system doing unique passwords.

878
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Well, it may not affect most of our listeners.

879
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Club Nintendo Japan also was hacked.

880
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I guess they realized that there was a bunch of failed login attempts or something like that,

881
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and then they said that just under 24,000 illegitimate logins between June 9th and July 4th

882
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
from over 15 million attempts.

883
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So basically said that some of the information compromised in the attack

884
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
included full names, phone numbers, home email addresses,

885
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and since they don't hold any credit card information, none of that was leaked.

886
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But still, it sucks.

887
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Still, names and addresses always kind of sucks.

888
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You never know what's going to happen.

889
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I mean, I have my credit card around there.

890
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
They get enough stuff to mine enough information, they can create their own credit cards.

891
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Usually they have to get your social for that.

892
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Well, at least here in the States, they have to get your social for that.

893
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But still, scary.

894
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
All right, well, moving on, since you talked about Nintendo Japan,

895
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
one item that's been getting a lot of passion lately is the region locking that's on Nintendo's console.

896
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And you know, it's not something that apparently is going to exist on Xbox One or PlayStation 4,

897
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
which leaves the Wii U kind of the sole holdout when it comes to region locking.

898
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And I think we talked last week or the week before about there was a petition going around

899
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
to try and get Nintendo to reverse course on that and open up their system.

900
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Well, I don't want to say that Nintendo necessarily responded to it this week,

901
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
but there has been more context that's come out about region locking

902
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
that's making the rounds on the sites this week.

903
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And it was an interview with Satoru Iwata, and I believe this was run in IGN,

904
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,000
saying that, quote, from some people's perspectives, the region lock might seem like a kind of restriction.

905
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
But each region has its own cultural acceptance and legal restrictions, as well as different age ratings.

906
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
There are always things that we're required to do in each different region,

907
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
which may go counter to the idea that players around the world want the freedom to play whatever they want.

908
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Continuing the quote here, I hope the game fans can understand that the industry isn't doing this solely out of business ego.

909
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
There are some reasons behind it.

910
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Yeah, but I don't think your average mom is going to accidentally import a Japanese copy of some game or something like that.

911
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Oh my God, content that's not appropriate for over here is on that game.

912
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh no, that's not going to happen.

913
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,000
It's going to be dedicated fans that know what they want to play are going to pay the fees to import a game to get it over here.

914
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I don't know, I don't see the problem.

915
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Considering it's not a problem for the other consoles, why should it be a problem for this console?

916
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I think the hard thing about this too is that I get the whole business ego thing and you have your reasons for doing it,

917
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
but you look really silly when your peers aren't doing it.

918
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
That's the problem.

919
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
If Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft were all banded together doing the same thing, this probably wouldn't be an issue in the first place.

920
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Also, I think that they're trying to keep the purity of their marketplace the way it is,

921
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:13,000
because they're known for being more of a wholesome console versus the other systems that have a lot of violent games on there.

922
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So maybe that's the reason is that they want to make sure that, hey, we may have some stuff that comes out in Japan

923
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
that has maybe a little bit more nudity in it than, say, a version that comes out over here.

924
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Maybe that's why we don't want to have these games come out over here for some reason.

925
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But at the same time, it's not like it's going to accidentally fall into the hands of...

926
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
How do they think does that work?

927
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
That someone's going to go into the store and somehow get a copy from Japan?

928
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
They don't do that very often.

929
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Whenever we talk about licensing in regions, I can't help but go back ten years to when we used to talk a lot about Dance Dance Revolution.

930
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Part of the interesting stuff about that game is that that became a huge thing over here,

931
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
but all those machines were being imported from Japan.

932
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
A lot of the games people were playing were imported from Japan.

933
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
There was a lot of...

934
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
They couldn't bring it over here because a lot of it came down to music licensing.

935
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
A lot of the catchy stuff from Dance Dance Revolution, like Butterfly.

936
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Everybody remembers that for the first time they ever saw DDR years ago, the Butterfly song.

937
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Well, that was from a Japanese series of dance albums.

938
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,000
They had a license with the Toshiba EMI, which is the record company in Japan, to do that whole thing.

939
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
They couldn't just do it as is over here.

940
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
They would have to re-license it, make that agreement work for the US,

941
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and Konami, in a lot of their hard-headedness, which in some ways I think did come down to business ego, didn't do it.

942
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Wouldn't do it.

943
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And a lot of the stuff we got here in America, especially at first, was just like Konami Originals.

944
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Remember Dance Dance Revolution, Konamiics?

945
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
They made a game out of nothing but Konami Originals because you don't have to license that stuff.

946
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And finally, once those games started proving themselves, thanks to the fandom and the fact that the peripheral actually sold,

947
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:13,000
then they started making more quality games like DDR Max 2, UltraMix 2, which had a lot of US-specific licenses that were pretty good in it.

948
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:21,000
But even at the end of the day, the arcade machines were almost still always coming from Japan, until what finally...

949
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Well, they had USA Mix. That was one of the old ones.

950
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah, but that was freaking pity being thrown at us in the US, right?

951
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I'll take pity.

952
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But it was nothing like Max 2 in extreme arcades.

953
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I think finally, once Supernova hit, it seemed like they were getting songs licensed worldwide.

954
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But there was a huge gap between extreme and supernova, and there was probably some thought...

955
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I kind of missed when they were like, you know, not necessarily extreme, but like Max around there and EuroMix and stuff like that,

956
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
where each, you know, there was kind of like, you know, you had the European games had their own songs,

957
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and the US games kind of had their own songs, and the Japanese games had their own songs.

958
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I liked the differentiation there, but now it's just like so much stuff.

959
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I don't even know what the fuck's on there anymore. It's just...

960
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It is a lot of Konami originals now, but it's not bad.

961
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
When it comes to like licensing third-party stuff and so forth, I can understand...

962
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I hate it, although, but I can understand the point of region locking, why they have to do that.

963
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I think we need to understand we're in a more world market now with the internet and kind of find ways around that.

964
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Here's where it comes down to. It's really the fault of, I think, the way the US music industry works,

965
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and I'm not sure it's just limited to the US, but ironically enough, I was looking at this stuff today.

966
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:46,000
There is a bunch of different licensing. When you get licensing for music, they call them pro and non-pro artists.

967
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Pro basically means they're part of a performance rights organization,

968
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and what that means is you can license the music, you pay for the license or whatever for your game or whatever you want to do.

969
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You have it for your game, but because it's on your game, you're still not licensed for public performance.

970
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:17,000
If you have your game in an arcade or something like that, you still have to pay for the performance rights for those tracks that are in the game

971
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,000
because it's being publicly displayed. That was probably one of the problems,

972
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:30,000
where they wouldn't necessarily want to have to pay additional fees to license all the music over here.

973
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Again, although I understand that you can import everything.

974
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,000
At the same time, though, to go back to the whole region and import anything, how many people really import games?

975
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Not a whole ton. Granted, I really do want to import Earth Defense Force, and I probably will.

976
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Honestly, back in the day, in PlayStation, it was so easy, and I've openly admitted this on the show, I didn't import things, I pirated them.

977
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I had no problem. I bought DDR USA Mix, I bought DDR Canomics, and I bought all the US stuff they ever put out.

978
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But you know what? I pirated the Japanese games. If you're not going to put it out here for me to buy, I'm going to get what I want.

979
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I would have happily bought those games if they'd released them in the US.

980
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And I did buy a lot of those games that came out in Japan.

981
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Soundtracks and stuff. A lot. Not necessarily all of them. A lot.

982
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm not saying what I did was right, but I'm just saying this is what drives people to do it.

983
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because then you're talking about paying, what, $80 for a PlayStation 1 game? And it's like, fuck that.

984
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I bought a lot of games at anime conventions. I had R4 and stuff like that. Fantastic game.

985
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And like Dance Dance Revolution, what the hell was that? Extra Mix. Remember that one?

986
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
That was like fourth plus songs and the solo mix songs, I think.

987
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Alright, go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

988
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,000
SSG100Matt says, seriously, what's wrong with having multiple windows saying before you purchase, hey, this is an import title.

989
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It won't be in your native language. If you're going to complain about it, then you shouldn't buy this.

990
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I think that does happen on PlayStation. Like the Mega Man games that are all up were all the Japanese Mega Man redos that are all in the PlayStation Marketplace.

991
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And I think their warning is like in tiny text. You could probably easily miss it. I think.

992
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Well, here's the other thing, too, is why can't they have like...

993
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Well, they could easily build this in, but I know they don't want it because they want to make money from, you know, I guess just impulse purchases.

994
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:39,000
But why couldn't they just, you know, have like Android does where say you need to return the game, you can do it within like, you know, say seven days or something like that and get your money back.

995
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And at the very least, you know, if it's, oh, I can't understand this game because it's all in Japanese or something, you know, maybe I thought I could get through, but it's too text intensive to actually be able to play it.

996
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
You know, this isn't for me. I'm going to return it and get my money back or something like that.

997
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I don't see why they couldn't do that now, but I don't know. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but they could easily do that.

998
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I think that I am surprised that they don't open the marketplaces up because there's a lot of games that do want to purchase that like Earth Defense Force.

999
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
If I could buy Earth Defense Force 4 without having to import that thing. Hell yeah, I'd buy digitally.

1000
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I would totally buy it. I would have already bought it digitally, you know, but I'm going to have to pay seventy dollars to import that.

1001
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,000
A lot of people, not necessarily a lot of people in chat, but a lot of people I know talking about this game from our chat room.

1002
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, this region deal just reminded me of something else I played this week, Phantasy Star Online 2.

1003
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:41,000
And yeah, just irritating that Sega will not put that game out here, but maybe it has something to do with the free to play model and the Japan thing.

1004
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And you know, that's a whole other monkey wrench in the system.

1005
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Servers, I think it's server cost.

1006
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
When you have the store built in or what have you.

1007
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Maybe it's a game that they don't think they're going to make their money back on as fast over here and so they don't want to invest in local servers.

1008
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Alright, well let me welcome to the show, she's here ladies and gentlemen, Dark Soccer, or Jamie Summers.

1009
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Hi.

1010
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Hi, welcome. You made it.

1011
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah, this has been a harrowing day.

1012
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Yeah?

1013
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Trying to get in the chat.

1014
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Productive day though, right?

1015
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Yeah, we found a house that if all goes well, we're buying it.

1016
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Amazing.

1017
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And it's actually relatively close to here.

1018
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Wow, really?

1019
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It's over by ARC.

1020
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Okay.

1021
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It's a big house.

1022
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Yeah, I saw it from the picture you sent, yeah.

1023
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And it has perfect studio room.

1024
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Wow.

1025
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Moving on up.

1026
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Well, we'll keep our fingers crossed.

1027
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
We don't want to get ahead of ourselves.

1028
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
We'll keep our fingers crossed for you.

1029
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
We do not, but it is, it's adorbs.

1030
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Nice.

1031
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And it has almost no yard, so it's awesome.

1032
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Well, good luck.

1033
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You walked in on a story about Nintendo defending region locking.

1034
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So, and now you were talking about the whole, you know, the fact that Xbox One and Sony

1035
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
won't do it, but Nintendo is saying, you know, we're not doing this out of business ego.

1036
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
We have to do it.

1037
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
There's reasons behind it, but I'm kind of like, but your peers don't do it.

1038
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So, I don't know.

1039
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Anyway, I think that Nintendo tries to do things their own way.

1040
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And by the way, thank you.

1041
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Thank you for congratulations.

1042
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I, there's, I know reasons for doing it for controlling markets, at least.

1043
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And I know Nintendo tends, for as much as they like to innovate with the system, they

1044
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
like to stay traditional with the business model.

1045
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
So, it's sort of that same interesting, it's actually something I've noticed with a lot

1046
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
of Japanese businesses, that they'll tend to innovate with the tech or with the product

1047
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
that's going out, but keep their business model and their business practices very conservative.

1048
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And if this has been business as usual for them, I don't see them straying from it.

1049
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Okay.

1050
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So, I'm surprised that they kind of went back on the whole, you know, region free stuff

1051
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,000
because I remember the portable consoles from them used to be region free up until the 3DS.

1052
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And it's kind of weird that they went back on.

1053
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I mean, I guess there was a lot of piracy in the DS.

1054
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Maybe that was the reason they were trying to limit that.

1055
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Maybe, I don't know.

1056
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Maybe it has to, you know, I'm thinking the whole, like, the DLC and that stuff, like,

1057
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I kind of think there's something there with that too.

1058
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
See, I would agree with you if they were full into DLC and like online.

1059
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Well, they're starting to move that way though.

1060
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I mean, Super Luigi U.

1061
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
How long has it taken them?

1062
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I mean, seriously.

1063
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
But they're there.

1064
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
The plans are being set in motion.

1065
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I don't think they're there yet.

1066
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Well, they're coming.

1067
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
All right, anyhow.

1068
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Give me downloadable tracks and Mario Kart 8 and we'll talk.

1069
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Be careful what you wish for, young man.

1070
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I'm seriously, like, Mario Kart always sells me a console for Nintendo.

1071
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It's sad, but, like, I do like the idea of playing on a separate screen because, you know,

1072
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
my wife does hog the TV a lot.

1073
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
All right.

1074
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Or I have a laptop, I guess.

1075
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Well, Dark Sakura, I'm dying to talk to you about Atari Party and your gaming week,

1076
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
but we'll make the listeners wait a little bit.

1077
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
We'll do that at the top of Part B.

1078
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Yes.

1079
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Tonight.

1080
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So, we'll do that after the break tonight.

1081
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I can say though.

1082
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
We did do some reminiscing.

1083
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Tons of fun.

1084
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
We did do some reminiscing at the top of the show even though I didn't go to Atari Party

1085
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
because, you know, rehearsals.

1086
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Well, you know what next week is, yes?

1087
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yes, and I want to go so bad, but I can because I got Clue, rehearsals, and other stuff.

1088
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
You know what?

1089
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
What?

1090
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
California Shrews only once a year.

1091
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
You can watch Clue anytime.

1092
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
No, but the Clue performance is only once a year, man.

1093
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
My costume's sitting over there.

1094
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Okay, Colonel Mustard.

1095
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Anyhow.

1096
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Just don't let me find a wrench in your, you know.

1097
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
July 27th.

1098
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Colonial Theater in Sacramento.

1099
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Yours truly.

1100
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
On stage.

1101
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
On screen.

1102
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Clue.

1103
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
All right.

1104
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Let's move on with video game news.

1105
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Dark Soccer was bringing a lot of indie game news tonight since she's still getting powered

1106
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
on here.

1107
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I'm totally getting this game.

1108
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Undertale.

1109
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I don't know much about this, but Undertale is a traditional role-playing game, but it's

1110
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
trying to avoid violence.

1111
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So, it's like a pacifist role-playing game.

1112
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So, Undertale is a place where humans and monsters used to coexist peacefully, but as

1113
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
the two races tore apart because of war, the monsters went underground, and a child tumbles

1114
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
through a great hole and falls into a monster-filled domain.

1115
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Wasn't that the plot of Monsters, Inc.?

1116
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Sort of, but I like the twist on this.

1117
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Kitty.

1118
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I like the twist on this one.

1119
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Kitty.

1120
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So, yeah, Undertale is a game where no one gets hurt.

1121
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It says the ability to take out enemies with a click still exists, but so do alternate

1122
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
options.

1123
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
You can befriend a boss that you've encountered by talking to them.

1124
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Why not show your foes mercy and spare them?

1125
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I think that's kind of neat.

1126
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Something a little different.

1127
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Yeah, it gives you the opportunity to talk to them out of kicking your ass.

1128
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Let's see, the game is funding right now on Kickstarter, because you know a lot of these

1129
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
indie games are, and the funding ends on July 24th.

1130
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Windows, PC, and Mac, and it will be released in summer 2014.

1131
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
This may take my Kickstarter virginity.

1132
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Oh, yeah?

1133
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Yeah.

1134
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
You got into it, huh?

1135
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Yeah, it's such a neat concept, and I've really been getting more and more into the indie

1136
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
game scene, so I'm excited.

1137
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You missed my gaming week.

1138
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I've played a shit ton of indie stuff thanks to that fucking Steam trading card thing.

1139
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's addicting.

1140
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Well, I played a shit ton of old stuff.

1141
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Have you played Binding of Isaac?

1142
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I haven't.

1143
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
That game is disturbing.

1144
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I've started it.

1145
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It was really like, the controls bizarre on it, so I was like, this looks like Zelda,

1146
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
but bloody.

1147
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Yeah, well, it looks like Zelda, but it doesn't play anything like it.

1148
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
It plays more like Rogue.

1149
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
No, it doesn't.

1150
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It really is Rogue.

1151
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
It was alright, I started it.

1152
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I think I need to do like Operation Play My Steam games or something like that, because

1153
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I seriously have like 150 games that I know I haven't touched a lot of them.

1154
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
A lot of them are like, dude, I gotta get that, especially like Arma 2.

1155
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I need to get that to play DayZ.

1156
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Not touched it once.

1157
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Not even a single time.

1158
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and games that

1159
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
are coming a whole lot sooner than summer 2014, like this week.

1160
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah, not a whole lot this week, but there are some actual games.

1161
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Dark on Xbox 360, kind of a stealth vampire game that's okay, I guess.

1162
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:08,000
That's coming from Calypso NCAA Football, 2014, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox

1163
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
360 this week.

1164
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:18,000
The Metal Gear Solid Collection, Legacy Collection, which is pretty much all your Metal Gear games

1165
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:29,000
that you could possibly want on the PlayStation 3, including, they even have like the original

1166
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Metal Gear games in there as well, so that's kind of cool.

1167
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And I want to say also this week, I think was the expansion for Civilization V?

1168
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Woot!

1169
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
It is this week.

1170
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So, yeah, so that'll be coming out as well.

1171
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I'm trying to think, did I forget anything else here?

1172
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Let's see here.

1173
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Yeah, Brave New World was this week.

1174
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Okay, cool.

1175
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And I thought there was one other game.

1176
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I'm forgetting here.

1177
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
What is it?

1178
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Nope.

1179
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Nope, that was it.

1180
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
All right.

1181
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Then let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases over there on the

1182
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
PlayStation 3 this week.

1183
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
On kind of an off cycle day, July 10th, Nobunaga no Yabu Online, Tenka Mugen no Shu comes out

1184
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
in Treasure and regular editions.

1185
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I'm thinking that's an expansion.

1186
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I think Nobunaga no Yabu is already out there, so I think this is an expansion version that's

1187
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
coming out from Koe.

1188
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Of course, the Nobunaga games have been huge in Japan for years, but they never really

1189
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
seem to catch on here the same way.

1190
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
But coming out on July 11th, Battlefield 3 gets a price reduction.

1191
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Dead Island Riptide gets its Japanese release.

1192
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Metal Gear Solid, the Legacy Collection will be there as well.

1193
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And something called a PlayStation 3 HDD Recorder Pack in 250 gig.

1194
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I think that's, oh, yeah, they have the whole, like, TiVo thing built into the PS3s in some

1195
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
places over there.

1196
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
So we don't really have that so much here.

1197
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So you have that to look forward to if you need a 250 gig drive for all your TV recording

1198
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
in Japan.

1199
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Otherwise, on the Xbox 360 this week, Dead Island Riptide also gets its release there

1200
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and Battlefield 3 a price reduction.

1201
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Monster Hunter Frontier G2 also gets a premium package.

1202
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
That, again, is on the Xbox 360.

1203
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, not a lot unless you need some new headphones because

1204
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
that's a peripheral that's out this week.

1205
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:29,000
On the Wii U, July 13th, we'll see the release of New Super Luigi U as well as Pikmin 3.

1206
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Kind of bam, bam, getting hit with two games there.

1207
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:39,000
There's a new Wii U Premium Set 32 gig in white also to look forward to on that day.

1208
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So kind of another little, I'm sure there will be a lot of promotion, almost like a

1209
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
soft relaunch of the Wii U with some of those games behind it.

1210
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:55,000
On the 3DS, not a lot, but there is Yuukai Watch, which is, I'm trying to see what this game is.

1211
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Is it Yuukai or Yo-kai?

1212
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I think it's Yo-kai.

1213
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That means monster or demon watch.

1214
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It definitely is some type of little kitty demon thing.

1215
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I wonder if that's based on an anime.

1216
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It's an RPG.

1217
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah, Yo-kai.

1218
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Alright, and let me look at the PSP because there's still games that come out there occasionally.

1219
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Yes, actually there are quite a few things this week.

1220
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Samurai Do Portable gets a price reduction.

1221
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:32,000
As far as new games go, there is Hanayakakana Waraga Ichizoku Saugare Polar Star in regular and limited edition.

1222
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And there's even a whole little set you can get with this as well.

1223
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Alright, that's it for Japanese releases.

1224
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
How about the UK?

1225
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Some stuff.

1226
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
On July 8th, we have Kavinsky for mobile Android iPad iPhone.

1227
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
On the 11th, we have Star Wars Pinball for Wii U and Tiny Thief for iPhone.

1228
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
On the 12th, we have a Dynasty Warriors 8.

1229
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That's all.

1230
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys.

1231
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And yes, she got here in time to do the classic game of the week.

1232
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I sped past a CHP guy and he didn't even bat an eye.

1233
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
He's like, go on girl, you go.

1234
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
We would have rolled it over until she got here if we had to.

1235
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
But we do have a couple more stories now that we're back on track. Loki.

1236
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Sorry, you put Saints Row in there as a classic game of the week.

1237
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I did play a lot of Commodore 64 games this week too.

1238
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Rob, they had all kinds of Atari computers and I played R-Type.

1239
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Did you?

1240
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Yeah.

1241
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And it sucks on the joystick, just saying.

1242
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Save it for the next half of the show, Loki.

1243
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
So now there's another new feature coming to Steam and that is Twitch integration.

1244
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
You can actually link your Twitch account with your Steam account.

1245
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
And of course, what's the first thing that's going to make use of it?

1246
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Dota 2. Yay.

1247
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:00,000
You'll be able to, I guess, watch Dota tournaments in-game or via, I guess, Twitch.

1248
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I don't know if they're going to have a specific app or something as part of the Steam store.

1249
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I don't know.

1250
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I didn't really poke around for that because I'm not really a big Dota 2 player.

1251
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I've tried it and, you know, it's just, that's a genre I haven't been able to crack yet.

1252
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
So the whole, what do they call those? Mobas?

1253
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Yeah, Massive Online Battle Arena.

1254
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Yeah.

1255
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
MobaMoga?

1256
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
MobaMoga?

1257
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
So, yeah, I haven't really gotten into those hardcore.

1258
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
But it doesn't sound like you can stream through this Twitch integration.

1259
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Like, Origin supposedly let you do, although it never worked for me.

1260
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Yeah, you can't stream, but you can actually, I guess, watch it.

1261
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And they said also that you can, what was it?

1262
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
You can get, like, oh, actually, they're launching this August 7th.

1263
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So it's not something you can do yet.

1264
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
But I don't know if they're going to have-

1265
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That's why I haven't seen ads for it. That makes sense now.

1266
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Yes, I guess now, I guess you can receive special items if you watch certain tournaments or something like that.

1267
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
So they're going to have, how much do you want to bet? Steam trading cards?

1268
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
How much do you want to bet?

1269
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Twitch, Twitch, Twitch. And I'm not talking about the website. That is actually my head twitching.

1270
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Alright.

1271
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Hey, Bobby, you know what VoG needs?

1272
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Uh oh.

1273
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Trading cards.

1274
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh god, don't give him ideas.

1275
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
VoG trading cards.

1276
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
You could trade the loot.

1277
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
That would be fun to make.

1278
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
You could maybe trade the loot or something.

1279
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I could totally make trading cards.

1280
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Oh boy, here we go.

1281
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
If you pay me for it.

1282
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
You know who does, you know who does some pretty interesting cards?

1283
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'll pay you in Pinkberry.

1284
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Ooh, I could deal with that.

1285
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Bresl, you know.

1286
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh yeah, he does his little-

1287
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
You know, I've got like four magic cards from him, and one of them was from when Shermy was alive, and it was Geek Cat.

1288
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So Shermy is a magic card.

1289
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Aww.

1290
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Yeah, she's a legend.

1291
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
That's fun.

1292
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Alright, one more story for you guys, and it's about the Double Fine Project Broken Age.

1293
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
This is probably the first Kickstarter project most of us heard about it.

1294
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Oh god.

1295
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And yeah, Broken Age apparently needs a little more money.

1296
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Well, here's the thing. I've heard two sides to this story.

1297
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I've heard, so I'm going to read this.

1298
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
As it was reported on Joystiq here, it says,

1299
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:24,000
they need more capital than the 3.3 million that it crowdfunded in March of 2012 through Kickstarter.

1300
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And there's a backers only update that says,

1301
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
quote, even though we received much more money from our Kickstarter than we or anybody anticipated,

1302
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,000
that didn't stop me from getting excited and designing a game so big that it would need even more money.

1303
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:42,000
So Double Fine will release the, I guess a refined version of the first half of the game in January of 2014,

1304
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
when the income through early access should give production for the rest of the game.

1305
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Now, I saw this somewhere, I don't know if it was Twitter or Tumblr or both,

1306
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
that people might be misconstruing this a bit and that they're actually trying,

1307
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
they're not trying to raise the money for this project,

1308
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
but they're putting it out there early so they can raise the capital to do other projects.

1309
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So the media might be jumping, like crossing lines a little bit here saying,

1310
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,000
oh, Kickstarter screwed up and nobody knows what the fuck they're doing on that site.

1311
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I think they're just a little suspicious because, you know,

1312
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
first they did this and they raised so much money and, you know, it should be enough.

1313
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Of course, you know, you adjust your budget for your game when you get a ton of extra revenue and stuff.

1314
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And that's why they have those stretch goals and stuff like that.

1315
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And then, of course, there's the massive Chalice game that's also being done by them

1316
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:43,000
that also just got Kickstarted that they're getting funding for already for a game that they haven't even finished the first one.

1317
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Yeah, I mean, I understand they have multiple teams working over there.

1318
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And now they're really, you know, they're trying to raise more funding for, you know,

1319
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
what originally seemed like this original game, but it may be for a future project.

1320
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
So it's like kind of like you guys are asking for a lot of money from us for different things.

1321
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And yet you still haven't been able to deliver on anything yet.

1322
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And I think that's kind of where the suspicion is.

1323
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But you know what? That's unlike a lot of the Kickstarter projects.

1324
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And, you know, even with the Ouya and stuff, you raise all this money, why couldn't you deliver them on time?

1325
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Well, it's because you can use DHL. I mean, all the money in the world is not going to make DHL good.

1326
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I mean, seriously.

1327
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Well, all the money in the world could maybe get FedExed to buy them.

1328
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
At least it didn't ship them Old Dominion. It wouldn't be here yet.

1329
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
It would be on a freaking turtle in the middle of the ocean, OK?

1330
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:37,000
All right, let's travel back to a time that was a lot more simpler than this.

1331
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
A lot more simpler?

1332
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
A lot more simpler with its grammar.

1333
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
You know what? You didn't have to wait for DHL to ship your game from Hong Kong.

1334
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
You walked into Best and you bought it.

1335
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Oh, no, no. You got it from Montgomery Ward, who's the mail order.

1336
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
That's right. It's the classic game of the week.

1337
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And then you'd get out your little magazine and order something from Funkoland.

1338
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
You check the price of it on their little newspaper.

1339
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
You know that was Dan started at Funkoland before the game came out?

1340
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
No, I know, I know, yeah.

1341
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I remember when they were an ad on the back of the magazine offering to buy your games.

1342
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
But anyway, the classic game of the week.

1343
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Millipede. Not centipede. Millipede.

1344
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And it was also known as Millipede Revenge of the Giant Instinct.

1345
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Insects. Why do I say instincts?

1346
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Miripido Kyodai Konchuu no Gyakushuu.

1347
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And that was its Famicom release.

1348
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
It came out in 1982 by Atari.

1349
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It is the sequel to Centipede.

1350
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And basically you have to score as many points as possible by destroying all the segments of the millipede as it moves down on the screen.

1351
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
When you destroy a section, it becomes a mushroom.

1352
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And you use a trackball to play it.

1353
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
So you don't even need a joystick. This is old school.

1354
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And guess what?

1355
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
The reason why I brought this up is because we actually had a prototype cartridge of it for the Atari 5200.

1356
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So when I bring up lists, I will tell you if you have an Atari 5200, I will tell you how to get it.

1357
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Atari age. They're great people. Anyway.

1358
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
So basically, the big differences between Millipede and Centipede.

1359
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And keep in mind, I like Millipede better than Centipede.

1360
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Is that the earwig is the same as the scorpion and centipede.

1361
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
So it makes poisonous mushrooms.

1362
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And it makes the millipede charge right towards the bottom.

1363
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
The bee basically does the same thing as the centipede.

1364
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It drops mushrooms on a vertical line.

1365
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And takes two shots to kill.

1366
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
The spider bounces all over the screen.

1367
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
But you can get multiple spiders. You have an inchworm.

1368
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And when it hits, it slows all the enemies on the screen for a short period of time.

1369
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You have the beetle that crawls around the player area.

1370
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
And then goes into the leaves.

1371
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
And it turns any mushroom it touches into indestructible flowers.

1372
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And when it hits, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.

1373
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
The dragonfly drops mushrooms while zigzagging.

1374
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And it can be destroyed with one shot.

1375
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
The mosquito bounces off the sides.

1376
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And when you hit it, it scrolls the screen up one row.

1377
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And then there's a DDT bomb that you can blow up with one shot.

1378
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And it destroys all the enemies and mushrooms within its blast radius.

1379
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
But when the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen.

1380
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
So you can have up to four bombs in play at a time.

1381
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Basically, when you get rid of all of the poisoned mushrooms, they all revert to normal.

1382
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And they all turn into normal when you lose a life.

1383
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So they don't have to worry about that if you happen to suck and die.

1384
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And you have new mushrooms growing on the field when others go.

1385
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And it's just really awesome.

1386
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It's basically just scrolling and shooting as fast as possible.

1387
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
And to me this was harder than centipede.

1388
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And a lot more challenging.

1389
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
It just moved a lot faster.

1390
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
It was so much fun.

1391
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And it has... centipede and millipede both have the best 1-up sound.

1392
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
The...

1393
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Which I can't do because I have no voice...

1394
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
As far as releases that came out.

1395
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
It came out on the Atari 8-bit and ST computer line and the Atari 2600.

1396
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
There was a NES version published in 1985.

1397
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,000
It came out with centipede on the Game Boy as Arcade Classics number 2 centipede millipede.

1398
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
It was released with centipede on Xbox 360 on Xbox Live Arcade.

1399
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And it was going to be...

1400
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
The Atari 2600 port was going to be a launch title for the Xbox 360

1401
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and the Games For Windows Live Game Room thing.

1402
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
It was on the Game Room on May 26, 2010.

1403
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Now like I was saying...

1404
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
There are various prototype carts out there.

1405
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
We have a version for Atari 5200.

1406
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And I believe it might have been a...

1407
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
A conversion from one of the PC versions.

1408
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
But it's really good.

1409
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
We've got Atari Trackball, which is almost as big as an Atari 5200.

1410
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And if you've ever seen an Atari 5200, that sucker's huge.

1411
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
You know, I was not a fan of this on the Xbox 360 Arcade.

1412
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And you know why? No Trackball.

1413
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
You cannot play this game without a Trackball.

1414
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Trackball or get out.

1415
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
If you play it on an Atari 2600 joystick, it's not the same.

1416
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
It's not the same.

1417
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It's like playing Tempest without a Trackball.

1418
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Well, you know what?

1419
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
You need the twist dial for Tempest.

1420
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
That's what I meant.

1421
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
We were actually going to try to make a...

1422
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Because we actually have Tempest 5200.

1423
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Actually, Tempest with a Trackball, though, is okay.

1424
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Tempest worked well with a Trackball.

1425
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And if a mouse is on the right settings, that's like the closest you get.

1426
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
But it just doesn't work.

1427
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
But then again, Tempest 2000 was pretty kickass.

1428
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Well, I'm going to go ahead and say, as I said earlier,

1429
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
that for anybody who happens to have an Atari 5200,

1430
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
go to Atari Age, you can buy the copy.

1431
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I think that we paid like 25 for ours.

1432
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
We also did get a copy of Tempest for the Atari 5200.

1433
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And I'll tell you, they're great people.

1434
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
They make really quality products.

1435
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
They come in, I believe it's refurbished cartridges, repurposed cartridges.

1436
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And it's just, they're great people.

1437
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So if you've got the 5200, definitely get their release of Millipede.

1438
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
As far as high scores, by the way,

1439
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
there was a high score set by Donald Hayes in New Hampshire

1440
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
of 10,627,331 points.

1441
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
That was in 1994.

1442
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And then the highest score in tournament play was also set by him

1443
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
at almost 7,000,000 points.

1444
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,000
The default high scores in the arcade are actually FXL and ED.

1445
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
ED is for Ed Log, who was the design and programmer.

1446
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And Franz Lasinger was also a designer and tester.

1447
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And it was the only way that they could get their credits in the game

1448
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
because at the time Atari didn't allow them to put their credits in.

1449
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And that is your trivia.

1450
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
That is a classic game. It is Millipede.

1451
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
All right. Millipede is the classic game of the week.

1452
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
A very fitting choice considering some of the shenanigans

1453
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
you've been up to this week.

1454
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And I'm sure we'll get something out of California Xtreme next week.

1455
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Have you ever done the Journey video game? It might be time.

1456
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
It might be time.

1457
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I have. Well, not the Journey video game.

1458
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
But I've played it a bunch of times.

1459
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
And then I screamed and cried a little bit and felt sick.

1460
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
All right.

1461
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And as I say, just hold on.

1462
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Because the Atari 800, there's mentions of it coming up next part.

1463
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
All right.

1464
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
As far as what systems I don't have, I do not have the Fairchild Channel-F.

1465
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Just saying.

1466
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
If somebody's looking to buy a Darksider system.

1467
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Or the first Magnavox Odyssey. But I do have an Odyssey, too.

1468
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Do you have a Virtual Boy?

1469
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Yes, I do.

1470
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Wow. I didn't know that.

1471
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
There's a Virtual Boy that came in the phone case.

1472
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Because Dan bought it from Blockbuster.

1473
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I want to come over and get a headache.

1474
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Sure.

1475
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Maybe we'll have a great big headache party.

1476
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I'll play my 3DS on 3D.

1477
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And you can play the Virtual Boy.

1478
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And then we'll both be in pain.

1479
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And then we'll spin around until we barf.

1480
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Yay.

1481
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Don't they have an Oculus Rift emulator or something like that

1482
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
that has Virtual Boy?

1483
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
That wouldn't surprise me at all, actually.

1484
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
This Oculus Rift thing is going to be interesting

1485
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
when it's at a consumer level, you know?

1486
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Coffee.

1487
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
What do I look like, Dan?

1488
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Anyhow.

1489
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
No.

1490
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Alright.

1491
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Let us take a break here.

1492
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
We're going to take a quick break.

1493
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And when we come back with more of Orange Lawn Radio,

1494
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Darksider's going to talk to us about Atari Party.

1495
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
You're going to talk to us through our full question of the week

1496
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
about board games and video games colliding.

1497
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I am.

1498
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I met you, the audience.

1499
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
But you can talk to us about it, too, if you want, Darksider.

1500
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
No, I don't want to.

1501
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
What, you don't like board games?

1502
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I like card games.

1503
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Alright.

1504
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Because I've been, I've had my mind blown with Cards Against Humanity.

1505
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And we like your emails, and we like to do some FUs of the Week,

1506
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
and we like to take your phone calls.

1507
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
All that when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1508
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Hi there.

1509
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
This is Redertainment.

1510
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio,

1511
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
the show where every gamer has a voice.

1512
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
And I want to use my voice to tell you that

1513
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Garris ain't got nothing on Samantha Trainer.

1514
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live.

1515
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Tonight, July the 7th of 2013, and we are back,

1516
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Episode 511 of our show with all of you, live.vognetwork.com.

1517
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And DarkSakura, she's here now.

1518
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And I have coffee.

1519
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
After running a variety of errands and so forth.

1520
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I'm giddy still.

1521
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I'm giddy.

1522
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Yeah?

1523
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I'm showing off the pictures of the house like it's a cat.

1524
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Well, just be careful.

1525
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Get the keys first.

1526
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I know, I know.

1527
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Well, we're-

1528
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I don't need to press Sakura should anything go wrong next week.

1529
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I am just saying that we're in a good position.

1530
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Yeah.

1531
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
We're in a good position.

1532
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And it would take us about 30 to 45 days to get in the house,

1533
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
assuming everything goes fluidly.

1534
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Swell.

1535
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Well, good luck.

1536
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
We're all crossing our fingers and toes,

1537
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
but I don't want to see you pissed off.

1538
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
But they have to see our conditioner first.

1539
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
All right.

1540
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And I got to say, though,

1541
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
that a new house doesn't exactly make for

1542
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
as exciting swap note pictures as a cat.

1543
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
That's true.

1544
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I could put little doki-doki symbols on the house

1545
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and make it blush.

1546
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Or I could make it, you know,

1547
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
demonic like the house from Poltergeist or something.

1548
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Nice.

1549
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
All right.

1550
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Well, let's talk about Atari Party.

1551
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Since I've been telling the listeners you went to this,

1552
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
and I'm sure our retro gaming fans can appreciate

1553
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
the fun of Atari Parties.

1554
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Tell us a little bit about what it is

1555
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
and what you experienced when you went.

1556
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Atari Party.

1557
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
And basically this has happened, I think,

1558
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
every year for the last, I want to say six years or so.

1559
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And also you can look on Facebook.

1560
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
The Atari Party folks have a page.

1561
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
But this guy put everything together.

1562
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
He brings a lot of his own stuff.

1563
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And volunteers can bring their own systems.

1564
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,000
We had just all kinds of things across the board.

1565
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Like, we were the only ones there with a 5200,

1566
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
but we brought two of them.

1567
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And then someone had an Atari flashback set up.

1568
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
There was a Jaguar set up on the big screen.

1569
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
So there was some Tempest and some Dragon's Lair going on.

1570
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
We were going to set up Alien vs. Predator

1571
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
in the little conference room to the side,

1572
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
but people ended up bringing their food in there.

1573
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
There were definitely Atari 800s.

1574
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
There were Atari, that was the computer.

1575
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
There were STs.

1576
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
There was a couple links set up.

1577
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
In fact, I believe that every Atari computer

1578
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
had a representation there.

1579
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
And let me look through my photos

1580
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
because I took pictures of a lot of the systems.

1581
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
In fact, one thing that really impressed me

1582
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
is that someone brought in an Atari touchpad.

1583
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
There were 7200s.

1584
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
There were just all kinds of stuff.

1585
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
So why?

1586
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Why Atari Party?

1587
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Because people love Atari. Why not? It's fun.

1588
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
People need to remember their roots.

1589
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I was kind of hoping the answer would be that.

1590
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Why the hell not?

1591
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
When's Commodore Party?

1592
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Am I invited to Commodore Party?

1593
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
You can start Commodore Party.

1594
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
But see, it was funny because this was at

1595
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
one of the Davis Public Libraries

1596
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
over by the, sorry, Library,

1597
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
over by this park that Atari Party used to be at.

1598
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
The People's Republic of Davis.

1599
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Abandon all hope ye who enter.

1600
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Exactly.

1601
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Abandon hope of having your car not pooped on.

1602
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Tiger Claw on Chat says,

1603
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
did they have some Atari arcade games too?

1604
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
There was a guy there who,

1605
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I think he came from,

1606
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
he came from out of state. I know that.

1607
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
But he hooked up an emulator that had different

1608
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
emulated games.

1609
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
He even had any game that had been on an Atari system.

1610
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
He had the arcade versions of plus the

1611
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
regular Atari, various Atari versions.

1612
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I didn't realize that people came out of state for this.

1613
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I thought it was kind of a locals thing.

1614
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
A lot of people were more like just from out of,

1615
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
like our friends Tim and his girlfriend

1616
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
came from the Bay Area.

1617
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Oh, okay. Like Reno is, you know, out of state,

1618
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
but it's not that far.

1619
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yeah, no, this guy I think came from a couple states over.

1620
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
So I didn't ask him.

1621
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
To be honest, my sign language isn't that great.

1622
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I didn't mention he's deaf.

1623
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But he was using his iPad as a communication tool.

1624
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And like I am way out of practice with my ASL.

1625
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
So, yeah.

1626
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
But we, funny, Rage Nator asks,

1627
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
would two Atari 5200s equal an Atari 10400?

1628
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
No, because they don't do that.

1629
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
One of the pictures I got of a really good version

1630
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,000
of Pac-Man was played on an Atari 1200 XL.

1631
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
There were several different Atari computers there.

1632
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Like I said earlier,

1633
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
there was one that was running R-Type.

1634
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Another one running Ghost and Gallows.

1635
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Just the thing is that while they make the games look pretty,

1636
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
they don't sound too fantastic.

1637
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
And the control was shit.

1638
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
It's just really hard to play either of those games on a keyboard

1639
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
or with the joystick, with an analog joystick

1640
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
that just keeps wanting to recenter itself.

1641
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I'm looking at the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

1642
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
SSJ100Matt says, I saw Dan's pictures on Facebook

1643
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
and I thought it was really cool

1644
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
to see kids playing systems that were twice their age.

1645
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
You know what, that was something that we were discussing

1646
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
during the event.

1647
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I mean, there were a lot of kids that,

1648
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I mean, some of them came with their parents

1649
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
that remembered everything.

1650
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I met a really nice guy who actually had a Japanese 3DS,

1651
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
so I now have a Japanese tag on my 3DS.

1652
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Well, right here, I should say.

1653
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
And, you know, I just chatted with a lot of folks

1654
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
and we all had the same love of old, stinky systems.

1655
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And there were, though, a lot of people like,

1656
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
oh my god, you have a 5200, rah, rah, rah.

1657
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And I was like, dude, you have a working 7200,

1658
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
or 7800, yeah, with the worst joysticks ever.

1659
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Oh my god, now the Atari 5200,

1660
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
the joysticks were notorious for breaking.

1661
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
We had some good replacements

1662
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
and Dan made a dedicated button pad to work with it.

1663
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
But because we had that trackball,

1664
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
a lot of people, you should see people

1665
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
trying to play Dig Dug with trackball, it's hilarious.

1666
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
But Dan was saying that he noticed a lot of girls

1667
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
were sitting down and wanting to play Qbert.

1668
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Like, he had the most, he was saying,

1669
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
it was like, I think that he noticed

1670
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
that enough women were sitting down

1671
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
and actually just playing Qbert above all else.

1672
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
So, and then he's like, is it a girl thing?

1673
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Is Qbert a girl thing?

1674
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I was like, well, maybe it's the nose, huh?

1675
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Wow, is Qbert a girl thing?

1676
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I like Qbert, what the hell does that mean?

1677
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I like Qbert, but you know what my game is

1678
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
on the Atari 5200 is Kix.

1679
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Oh yeah, Kix is a fun game.

1680
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I sat and played like a crap ton of Kix.

1681
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I got like three split Kixes in a row.

1682
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Kix was basically the inspiration for Miss Nude World 96.

1683
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Yes it was, but it was better.

1684
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
No it didn't, it didn't have techno music.

1685
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Or boobies.

1686
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Raginator in chat says, I gotta ask,

1687
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
did anyone bring the 2600 version of Pac-Man

1688
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
or even E.T.?

1689
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Yes, several people did.

1690
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
And I played 2600 Pac-Man.

1691
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I actually made it pretty far on 2600 Pac-Man.

1692
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
We did have people bringing E.T.

1693
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And I actually sat next to some guy

1694
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
and I was like, you do realize

1695
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
that this is like a prime example

1696
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
of gamer masochism, right?

1697
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
He's like, yeah.

1698
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I was like, so you're just into that kind of thing?

1699
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
He's like, yeah.

1700
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And then we started, remember that story

1701
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
we brought up though where the town in Arizona

1702
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
was willing to let the dump be excavated?

1703
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Well, a couple of people hadn't heard that

1704
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
so we were talking about it and they're like,

1705
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
well, we get to find out if it's, uh...

1706
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Ugh, fuck.

1707
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Rob, that hurts my soul.

1708
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I love that game.

1709
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
This is some iconic noise though.

1710
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Like, it's funny.

1711
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
But keep in mind, this is the best they did

1712
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
with what they had.

1713
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Oh yeah, no, if you read the stories

1714
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
about how these games had to be programmed

1715
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
like with such a short turnaround

1716
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
and the coding in these games is so tight,

1717
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
like you actually...

1718
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
You have no room for bonuses.

1719
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
It's kind of impressive.

1720
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I think the guy that programmed Jungle Hunt

1721
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
has some weird Easter egg in that

1722
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
where if you get a certain score at a certain time

1723
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
and do a silly dance and then interpretive music,

1724
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
then maybe a prayer to Satan or something,

1725
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
then you can see his initials pop up for five seconds.

1726
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Now the ET game, do you know the history

1727
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
of why the ET game is this bad?

1728
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Yes. Howard Scott Warshaw, who did some great games,

1729
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
he did Yars Revenge, he only had like...

1730
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Three weeks.

1731
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Yeah, oh yeah.

1732
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Three weeks to put out.

1733
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
And the reason why there were so many copies of it

1734
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
is they were expecting that because of the movie tie-in,

1735
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
because the movies sold so much,

1736
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
that they were expecting the game to equally sell as much

1737
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
and basically it had high sales during its first week

1738
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
and then people realized how bad it was

1739
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
and that's where that urban legend of there being

1740
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
just that dump full of ET cartridges.

1741
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I want to see a 48-hour game jam to make new ET games.

1742
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
You know, I remember a story we covered on the show

1743
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
not that long ago where somebody actually fixed ET.

1744
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I'm using my quarter fingers.

1745
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Yeah, where they went back and made the collision detection

1746
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
not so crazy and just made the game better, basically.

1747
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Well, I mean, the equivalent of doing this in three weeks

1748
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
was me doing my final exam in one day

1749
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
for my web design class.

1750
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Yeah, my site looks pretty good, but could have been better.

1751
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Yeah, it could have actually worked, too.

1752
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
But, well, actually I did three days,

1753
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
got my web design stuff done.

1754
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
But anyway, going back to what was there,

1755
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
there was a really good representation

1756
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
and not just Atari systems, too.

1757
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
There were people who brought in Atari collections.

1758
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Like I said, there was an Atari flashback,

1759
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
but someone also brought a Nintendo with the Atari games

1760
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
that were released for Nintendo, an NES.

1761
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And there was a PlayStation with one of the, sorry,

1762
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
a PS2 with one of the collections on it.

1763
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Someone had a Game Boy, two Game Boy SPs

1764
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:20,000
with various Atari collection packs on it.

1765
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And like I said, we had Linksys.

1766
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
We had various computer setups.

1767
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
There were actually a lot more computer setups

1768
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
than console setups, I noticed.

1769
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And then there was a raffle, and some jerk face

1770
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
ran off with one of the books for the raffle.

1771
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
So someone had to go without a prize.

1772
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Oh, no, like legit, oh, I thought you were saying

1773
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
that like, oh, he won what I wanted.

1774
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
It was like a book about Atari stuff.

1775
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
No, some guy legit stole it.

1776
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Asshole.

1777
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Yeah, the guy who ran it, Bill,

1778
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
and Bill is just, he's so great for,

1779
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
he had the best shirt, too.

1780
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
He had one of the ghost monsters being chased

1781
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
by the Act01 all in pixels, you know, from Ghostbusters.

1782
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It was really cute.

1783
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
And his kids were there.

1784
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And there were like lots of,

1785
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I would probably say preteen and up aged kids,

1786
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
and just going around and having a good time,

1787
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
and getting to see these things.

1788
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Oh, and I've actually heard flat out,

1789
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I've never seen this game before, this is fun.

1790
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Just goes to show that you don't have to have

1791
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
the shiniest graphics to make a really good game.

1792
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,000
And like, Dan, we had to stay relatively near his stuff

1793
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
because we had so many 5200 games

1794
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
that we brought with us in the protos.

1795
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
But we had a few rounds of Super Pac-Man going on,

1796
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
and if anyone wants to look, a few days back,

1797
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
well, actually just yesterday's stuff on my Tumblr,

1798
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:48,000
my Tumblr is Kurotsubasa, it's K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.

1799
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I have some of my photos from Atari Party,

1800
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
and if you're on Facebook and a friend of me,

1801
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I did put up a thing, but I will go to my fan page

1802
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
and share the photos there so that people can see

1803
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
the photos from Atari Party.

1804
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Cool.

1805
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I had a really good time, it was just fun,

1806
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
and the guys bought us sodas, and I didn't drink any

1807
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
because they're regular Coke.

1808
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So more classic gaming next week with California Extreme.

1809
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Yeah, I didn't know that California Extreme was next week,

1810
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
and Dan's like, so you're going to California Extreme with me?

1811
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I guess so.

1812
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Are you going to be back for the show?

1813
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Saturday.

1814
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Oh yeah, well it runs all weekend long.

1815
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
But we're not going for the whole thing, because money.

1816
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Sure, sure.

1817
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Okay.

1818
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Well, I want to move on with the show,

1819
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
get into rapid fire news, but I did want to ask about

1820
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
your gaming week outside of Atari Party.

1821
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Have you played anything this week besides Atari?

1822
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Besides Atari games?

1823
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Well, I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIV this weekend

1824
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
because I wanted to start my scholar.

1825
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
You can't.

1826
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Arcana still isn't in the beta.

1827
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Ah, fuck!

1828
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
You wouldn't have been able to anyway.

1829
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Well, poop.

1830
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Well, then I wanted to get at least past level 15.

1831
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing because,

1832
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
you know, I got my 3DS last weekend.

1833
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you, slidekick.

1834
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I have paid off my mortgage, two room expansions,

1835
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
my upstairs, and I'm paying off my upstairs room expansion.

1836
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I've been to the island, it doesn't really get me,

1837
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
it kind of gets me some good money.

1838
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
I have fruit everywhere.

1839
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Beetles, nothing but beetles.

1840
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
And I have a cross-dressing dog.

1841
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Awesome.

1842
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Named Butch.

1843
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
That's awesome.

1844
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Yes, I want Dina back there.

1845
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Dina was my lady.

1846
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Actually, no, I want the gay unicorn.

1847
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Yes, I've heard there's a gay unicorn.

1848
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
There's a gay unicorn named Julian, and I said,

1849
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Becky, don't, you know, that's not named after your son.

1850
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
He's just a gay unicorn.

1851
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
We know your little boy likes girls.

1852
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
But if he didn't, we'd still love him anyway.

1853
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Which makes me want him in my village so I can be his hag.

1854
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I would totally be his hag, and I would put up

1855
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
pride signs outside of his house.

1856
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
We'd have a parade just for him.

1857
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
You and Dina.

1858
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Julian and Dina.

1859
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
You go.

1860
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Do you think there's fanfic out there that ships those two?

1861
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Rob.

1862
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
As friends.

1863
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
This is the internet.

1864
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
There's fanfics that ship everybody and everything.

1865
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
There are fanfics that would take two blades of grass

1866
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
in a Star Trek movie and ship them.

1867
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And no, people actually-

1868
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I want to find some really dirty Animal Crossing fanfic

1869
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
and have some red on the show.

1870
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Oh, no.

1871
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Tumblr has created its own phenomenon,

1872
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
and that is shipping fandoms.

1873
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Creating avatars for fandoms and shipping them.

1874
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Welcome to the internet.

1875
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Everything is shippable.

1876
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Rob's looking it up too.

1877
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
You're so disgusting, Rob.

1878
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Alright, maybe I'll have something for you guys

1879
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
after rapid-fire news.

1880
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And Shakers.

1881
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I was going to be playing Ragnarok Online 2,

1882
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
but I gave it up for Final Fantasy XIV.

1883
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I did get a little bit of time on Drunken Robot Pornography,

1884
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
which is a great game.

1885
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I'd recommend everyone get it.

1886
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And I have to thank Gamer Girl,

1887
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
because she got me JetSight Radio.

1888
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And I love that game,

1889
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
but I have to do some rewiring with my various USB cables

1890
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
so that my hub will work again

1891
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:10,000
and I can plug in my Xbox controller to use on-

1892
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Shakers just shipped his pants.

1893
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I ship my pants with my shirt.

1894
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
But the shirt has to be on top.

1895
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Alright, we've got to move on with the show.

1896
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Thank you for the classic gaming take-back, though,

1897
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
and you'll bring us more of it next week.

1898
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Meanwhile, rapid-fire news about new games.

1899
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Loki, starting us off.

1900
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
So Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to require an install

1901
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

1902
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
which is not surprising, on Xbox 360,

1903
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
because it's such a large game.

1904
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
It is on two disks.

1905
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
The first disk will allow you to install the game,

1906
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
and then the second disk is going to be the one

1907
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
that you actually play with.

1908
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
So it creates an install partition for the game,

1909
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
and then you just play it from there on,

1910
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
which makes sense because the world's so fucking huge.

1911
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
The PS3, of course, is one disk because it's Blu-ray.

1912
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
You can store more shit on there.

1913
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
So you're going to need eight gigabytes of free space

1914
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,000
in order to install the first disk section

1915
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
or the section of the game on PlayStation 3.

1916
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I'm excited.

1917
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Still can't wait to play it, and I'm not surprised.

1918
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And now, of course, the way they've gotten around things

1919
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,000
in Australia being unrated or not being barred

1920
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
because they can't get it rated,

1921
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
even though they have an R18 Plus rating, makes no sense,

1922
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
there is a low violence version that's being made

1923
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
for Australia for Saints Row IV,

1924
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
and that's been spotted on Steam.

1925
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
So I guess that's how they're going to get around it.

1926
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And remember, it's not the end of the world.

1927
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
There's always mods.

1928
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
You better believe that somebody in Australia

1929
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
is going to find a way around that shit

1930
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
to patch the game back to the way it should be.

1931
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
So just, you know, not a big deal.

1932
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
And speaking about patching, Fez is getting patched

1933
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
on Xbox Live Arcade.

1934
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Phil Fish said basically that, you know,

1935
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
now that the updates don't cost anything,

1936
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
he's going to spend a few months, I guess,

1937
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
to put an update together to fix the problems that were,

1938
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I guess, affecting about 1% of the players before.

1939
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So fix the problems that were in the first patch

1940
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
that they had to recall.

1941
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
So that's good news, I guess.

1942
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And of course, as a reminder, Fez 2 is not in development

1943
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,000
for the Xbox One or Xbox 360 because he's still pissed.

1944
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Sorry, I'm laughing over here because I'm finding

1945
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
some Animal Crossing fanfic to read.

1946
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
And this one isn't dirty, but it's about a relationship

1947
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
between Monique and Rosie.

1948
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And my favorite is that they actually incorporated

1949
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
how Monique always says, pfft, into the story.

1950
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And they're fighting over a letter.

1951
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
And Monique shrugged her shoulders

1952
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
then shook her head once more.

1953
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Then you won't mind if I read this then.

1954
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I know what I'm doing after the show.

1955
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
All right, moving on to some other rapid-fire news.

1956
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Xbox One's Kinect will be able to read QR codes.

1957
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
This will be handy because that way you don't have to input

1958
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
those long download codes.

1959
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
This was confirmed by Xbox Chief Product Officer

1960
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Mark Whitman on Twitter.

1961
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
So yeah, that's kind of neat that you won't have to input

1962
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
those long download codes.

1963
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Hopefully you don't have to scratch off all that crap,

1964
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
though, because if some of that gets left behind,

1965
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
then it's going to screw up the QR codes.

1966
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So they'll find a way around that, I guess.

1967
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
A little bit of Final Fantasy news.

1968
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Lightning Returns, of course, is coming out early next year

1969
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and invoking a little bit of the Final Fantasy VII wank.

1970
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I know.

1971
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Cloud-based pre-order bonuses,

1972
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
and I'm not talking about in the cloud.

1973
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
There's already wank going on.

1974
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
You can actually dress her up as Cloud,

1975
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
which is kind of neat.

1976
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
There's the wank going on about the outfit being

1977
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
over-sexualized. No, it's not.

1978
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
It looks exactly like on Cloud. She just has boobs.

1979
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And you can pre-order this.

1980
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
It's a pre-order bonus. That's what this is for.

1981
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
This is currently listed at Amazon.

1982
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Don't know if it's exclusive to Amazon or what yet,

1983
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
but we'll find out a little closer to February 11th

1984
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
when the game is set to come out.

1985
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
By the way, I should state, it wasn't in this particular story,

1986
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
but there was also news coming out of Final Fantasy XIV

1987
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
that there's going to be, for the lady characters,

1988
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
you will be able to dress your character similar to Lightning,

1989
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
and guy characters can dress their character similar to Snow,

1990
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
which I think is kind of interesting.

1991
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
And a lot of people are like,

1992
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
But are they going to be a hero?

1993
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Get your 13 out of my 14.

1994
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Are they going to be a hero?

1995
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Everybody on the internet sounds like Monique.

1996
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Get your 13 out of my 14.

1997
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
But there's a lot of Final Fantasy throwbacks.

1998
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Like, the quest I was stuck on,

1999
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I had to kill a Magitek armor, okay?

2000
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Get your six out of my 14.

2001
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
No, actually, you can stay.

2002
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Anyhow, also, speaking of Final Fantasy VII,

2003
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Final Fantasy VII, I'm sure a lot of you heard,

2004
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
now available on Steam for $11.99.

2005
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Now, this game's been out, you know, forever,

2006
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
but now it works on Windows 7.

2007
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Actually, they released the version that works on Windows 7 last year,

2008
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
but it's through Steam,

2009
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
and because it's with Steam, it has cloud saves,

2010
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
and Steam achievements.

2011
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I'm tempted. I'm sorely tempted.

2012
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Character booster.

2013
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Well, you need to create a new save file,

2014
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
where you know who dies.

2015
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I know!

2016
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
It's like you can't carry your PlayStation 1 file over,

2017
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
so you need something to kill her again.

2018
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I can't carry over my last PC save either, huh?

2019
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I know. I don't know if that'll work.

2020
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
If Dark Sakura's able to get Julian and Dina to get married,

2021
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
or, excuse me, to celebrate their pride in Animal Crossing,

2022
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
maybe she can convince Microsoft to loan a Halo Warthog

2023
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
decorated in rainbow colors,

2024
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
because this was featured in the Seattle Pride Parade on Sunday, June 30th.

2025
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
The Halo vehicle, of course,

2026
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Microsoft's up there in the Seattle area.

2027
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
A decorated Warthog in rainbow colors,

2028
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:13,000
escorted by a Spartan soldier and supporters of LGBT equality

2029
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
were there at the Pride Parade in Seattle.

2030
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Pretty cool.

2031
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I like to see game companies get involved in that.

2032
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I know EA usually does the one here in San Francisco,

2033
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
so very, very cool.

2034
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

2035
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I have some stuff.

2036
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Well, Natural Selection 2 is going to add female marines,

2037
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
and the thing that really makes me happy about this

2038
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
is that they're actually in a legit uniform.

2039
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I mean, they're not made to have boob-shaped armor or anything like that.

2040
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Basically, they had to take the time to do research, concept art,

2041
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
doing the textures and models, animation,

2042
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
and then making sure that the game would sell

2043
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
before they could actually incorporate the female marine.

2044
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So they have that coming out,

2045
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
and let me see if I've got a date on it.

2046
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
It just says in late summer.

2047
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:20,000
In other news, Battlefield 3 Free is going to be free on PlayStation Plus this week.

2048
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Go get it.

2049
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Other free games include Jet Set Radio, Metal Slug XX,

2050
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Docoro, and Oddworld Munches Odyssey HD.

2051
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Sadly, I actually checked to see.

2052
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I don't know if they stagger when they upload those different games,

2053
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
but I only saw Battlefield 3.

2054
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I wanted Jet Set Radio.

2055
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Jet Set Radio.

2056
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I'll have to check it again.

2057
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
But I did manage to grab Battlefield 3.

2058
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I recommend anybody that has PlayStation Plus

2059
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
that listens to the show to go grab it as well

2060
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
because I think it would be fun for a game night or something like that

2061
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
because I have no idea what I'm doing with Battlefield 3.

2062
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Plus, it makes it even more fun that you can fly jets.

2063
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,000
You want to kick everyone's ass, right?

2064
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I just want to fly a jet and the people and do all sorts of crazy shit.

2065
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I think that would be fun.

2066
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Is that your goal in life? To fly a jet and do a person?

2067
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
No.

2068
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
So, other news.

2069
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
There is a Mega Man board game.

2070
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Well, there is going to be, let's see,

2071
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
it looks like they're trying to tie it in with 25th Anniversary,

2072
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
but it will let you be Mega Man on the board field

2073
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
and beat Dr. Wily the usual way, except with rolling dice, I guess.

2074
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
There's also going to be other memorabilia coming out

2075
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
including a Mega Man statue and 3DS case covers.

2076
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
But no game, so whatever.

2077
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Well, a board game.

2078
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
A board game?

2079
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Hey, don't diss board games.

2080
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I like board games.

2081
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Me too.

2082
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I played a really fun one and I can't remember the name of it,

2083
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
although it was more of a card game.

2084
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
It was fun. Everybody got dealt an identity.

2085
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
It was kind of like Mafia or Wolf Game or one of those types of things

2086
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
where everybody got dealt an identity.

2087
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Somebody in chat is going to know this.

2088
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Degenerate Johnny or somebody who knows their card games are going to know this.

2089
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
You get dealt these cards and three people would be the spies

2090
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
and everybody else is the good guys.

2091
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
And you go on missions, but if the spies go on missions,

2092
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
they can flunk the missions.

2093
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
And if too many missions get flunked, then the spies win.

2094
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
If missions pass, then the good guys win.

2095
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
And then you also have these cards that can reveal people's identities.

2096
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Well, it gets in this really good...

2097
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
You start arguing with all your friends about who's a spy and who's not a spy.

2098
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
You know, a la Mafia.

2099
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I think it was called The Resistance.

2100
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
I want to say that was the name of it.

2101
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Might have been the name of it.

2102
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
That made me just think of that old werewolf game

2103
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
that people used to play on DDR4.

2104
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Oh yeah, that's a thing that happens at conventions and stuff.

2105
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
That's all based off of LARP, basically.

2106
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Which, you know, OL LARP.

2107
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Big, big, positive reception to the OL LARP idea.

2108
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Just saying.

2109
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,000
You know what? I do kind of want to do OL LARP.

2110
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I definitely want to do OL LARP.

2111
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
But I have to play myself.

2112
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Maybe in our nod to DDR Freak, we could start with the wolf game.

2113
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
That would be cool.

2114
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
You know, it's going to sound a little bit sad,

2115
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
but I do miss my LARP days.

2116
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Where I would wear this...

2117
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
And keep in mind, it was vampire LARP.

2118
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
So it was even more sad.

2119
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Black Wolf in Chat says,

2120
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Used to play. Werewolf is all I do at Dragon Con.

2121
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I can't fucking wait for Dragon Con

2122
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
and actually play some authentic LARPing.

2123
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I'm so excited.

2124
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
In Mobile, where I'm from,

2125
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
the big convention there is Mobicon.

2126
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
And it's gotten a lot bigger, too.

2127
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
It was Gold Dragon's thing,

2128
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
and Gold Dragon's since gone out of business,

2129
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
but Mobicon has stayed a fixture.

2130
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
And it was my first actual LARP experience,

2131
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
was playing a vampire there.

2132
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
And now I think that they're doing a couple of other ones.

2133
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
And actually, when I went to...

2134
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
What's the convention?

2135
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Coast Con, I think it was, in Biloxi.

2136
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
They did a live action anime game.

2137
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
They just decided to make one up.

2138
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
And keep in mind, this is like in 1996.

2139
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
So if anyone wants to keep in mind what was out then.

2140
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I did Dragon Ball Z stuff.

2141
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I think this is it.

2142
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Fifth Dream linked me to something that's on Geek and Sundry,

2143
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
where it has a bunch of the nerd celebs,

2144
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
like Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day,

2145
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
are all playing The Resistance.

2146
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
And it's like this big reality show set up here.

2147
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
So I think this is the game. Yeah, yeah.

2148
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
This is fun.

2149
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
This is a lot of fun.

2150
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
This would be a good game for OLARP,

2151
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
even though it's not really LARPing.

2152
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I think people would enjoy watching us yell at each other

2153
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
and playing this game.

2154
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
It was a lot of fun.

2155
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Yes.

2156
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Oh yeah, this is definitely it,

2157
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
now that I can see the board here.

2158
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Very cool.

2159
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Alright, anyway.

2160
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Sorry for the sidetrack,

2161
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
but since we're talking about board games.

2162
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Let's go to the FUBU Question of the Week.

2163
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Take Facebook and Google+, slam them together,

2164
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
and you get FUBU.

2165
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
And this week, it's about board games.

2166
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Since we didn't just talk about this story anyhow,

2167
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
about Mega Man being a board game,

2168
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
we decided to ask our listeners,

2169
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
what video game do you think would make a fun board game?

2170
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Or, if you rather, what board game that isn't already one

2171
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
would make a fun video game?

2172
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
That one's hard, because I find a lot of people

2173
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
don't know what video games have been turned into board games.

2174
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,000
So, you know, if you named one that happens to already be out there,

2175
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
oh well, you know, they need to promote it better.

2176
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
But like, you know, I know Civilization is a board game,

2177
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
there's gonna be the Mass Effect Risk game.

2178
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I won, I won, I won, I won, I won.

2179
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And there's certainly a lot of board games that are video games.

2180
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
But maybe some of our listeners picked up on stuff

2181
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
that fell through the cracks.

2182
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
And that's what we're trying to find out

2183
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
in our FUGL Question of the Week this week.

2184
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
We'll start on Google+.

2185
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
JB Mon says,

2186
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I definitely think that a board game can be made out of Metal Gear Solid

2187
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
as some sort of tactical game, maybe Mass Effect as well.

2188
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Also, although this is a card game,

2189
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I definitely think Cards Against Humanity

2190
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
would make a fun Xbox Live arcade game.

2191
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
They do have Apples to Apples,

2192
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
which does have the Helen Keller card,

2193
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
which kind of led to Cards Against Humanity, just saying.

2194
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Robert Gauss on Google+, says,

2195
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
XCOM would be a good one, being turn-based already.

2196
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Animal Crossing also,

2197
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
but it would be a resource gathering trading game like Catan.

2198
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Dr. Noir says,

2199
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I've already, I've actually enjoyed the Dragon Age table chop RPGs

2200
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
and am very much amazed no one has put out a clean pen and paper RPG

2201
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
based on any Final Fantasy franchise.

2202
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Also, the D&D crossover, computer to tabletop and vice versa games

2203
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
are really enjoyable.

2204
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Thank you to the folks over on Google+.

2205
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Let's check out Facebook and some of the answers we have here on Facebook.

2206
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Ooh, we have a lot.

2207
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Jeremy Jay from Koopa Club says,

2208
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Metroid!

2209
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Also, I think The Legend of Zelda would lend itself well to the format.

2210
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I've never played the Milton Bradley game,

2211
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
but I don't think they've done one since then.

2212
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Clerical Error 404 says,

2213
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Castlevania could potentially make an entertaining board game,

2214
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
especially the entries that are primarily about exploration and backtracking.

2215
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
It's kind of interesting, Metroid and Castlevania,

2216
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
and I think of Metroidvania games.

2217
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
If I may make a suggestion, by the way,

2218
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
keep in mind that for some of these things,

2219
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
there are games out overseas.

2220
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
In fact, there's even RPGs in Japan

2221
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
that have spawned anime and various video games.

2222
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
For example, Lodoss War.

2223
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
It started off as a tabletop game.

2224
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Clerical Error also follows up,

2225
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
saying, I would really like to see a video game version

2226
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
or a completely new take on Arkham Asylum.

2227
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Now, Stan H. followed up later,

2228
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
saying there already is one, a board game.

2229
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
But, you know, it's kind of hard to keep track

2230
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
of a lot of the board games that are out there.

2231
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
So, you know, I didn't know until Stan said that either

2232
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
that there was an Arkham Asylum board game.

2233
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
But thanks to the boys from Koopa Club

2234
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
for jumping in there first on that question. I appreciate it.

2235
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Moving on, Katsuhiko J. says,

2236
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Katamari Damacy would make a fun board game.

2237
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Roll up all the pieces and weigh the ball to win.

2238
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Although keeping all the pieces would be a nightmare.

2239
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
That's actually kind of like silly awesome.

2240
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Think about what you could do with Velcro.

2241
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Like rolling over other Velcro things.

2242
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,000
You remember the actual Katamari that they had at E3?

2243
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm just thinking of just a big ball made of Velcro

2244
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
and you could roll over Velcro chips

2245
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
that would keep, like, you could add to the Velcro.

2246
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
But then taking that thing apart would be a bitch.

2247
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Yeah. But it would be fun.

2248
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,000
You did see the thing about the people that made the full-size ball

2249
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
as a controller for Katamari Damacy.

2250
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
So that, like, little kids could push it around and play the game.

2251
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Rob, I've got an easy solution for you.

2252
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Alright.

2253
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
And it makes cleanup even easier.

2254
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Remote-controlled electromagnet.

2255
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Magnets? Yes.

2256
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Because then there you go.

2257
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Magnets? How do they work?

2258
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
When you're done, you just click the button to turn the magnet off

2259
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
and, boop, everything comes free.

2260
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I'm sure that'll be cheap.

2261
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And get your credit cards far away from that.

2262
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
It's like wire wrapped around metal. Come on.

2263
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Actually, it would not be at all expensive.

2264
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
And keep in mind that if you have all your pieces as metal,

2265
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
magnetic current will carry through metal.

2266
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Alright. Let's see.

2267
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Clover Nikon says,

2268
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Well, Bioshock Infinite is a board game already,

2269
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
so it'd have to be Grand Theft Auto.

2270
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
That's a good idea for a board game.

2271
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
You got hot coffee. Lose a turn.

2272
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Stan H says,

2273
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
The Last of Us would make a good board game similar to Last Night on Earth,

2274
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
a board game where one player takes control of the infected

2275
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
and all other players control one of the survivors

2276
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
while looking around for weapons and tools.

2277
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I always mispronounce this name. I apologize.

2278
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Ciao says,

2279
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
A Mario board game might be interesting.

2280
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Gamer Girl says,

2281
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep.

2282
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I think they should totally make a board game based on the DLC content of that game

2283
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
at Borderlands 2, of course.

2284
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
It's so fun and just reminds me of the old pen and paper board games.

2285
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Degenerajani says,

2286
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
My first choice would be Mass Effect, but we all know that Mass Effect Risk,

2287
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
ahem, Galaxy at War, will be released this fall.

2288
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Therefore, I would go with a board game version of Deus Ex.

2289
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,000
With that being said, I cannot think of any better company

2290
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
to create the Deus Ex board game than Fantasy Flight.

2291
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Fantasy Flight has specialized in making board games

2292
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
based on video game titles such as Gears of War, Age of Conan,

2293
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
and pay attention, Robin Bobby, Civilization.

2294
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Yes, I'm aware of the Civilization board game, believe it or not.

2295
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Expensive as hell and about 11 billion pieces

2296
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
and nobody to play it with me.

2297
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Andy R says,

2298
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
How about a real-life triple triad? That would be cool.

2299
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Hey, I'm all for the Final Fantasy card games becoming like real card games.

2300
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
As far as board games to video games,

2301
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
I'd love to see more board games get a video game adaptation,

2302
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
as in just the board game but able to play over the internet.

2303
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
All my college friends live in different cities now

2304
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
and I'd love to be able to play with them over the internet with voice chat or such.

2305
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I'd really be interested to see what a video game company

2306
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
can make out of Galaxy truckers, though.

2307
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I'm sure to be hard as balls.

2308
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Ragenator says, I want to say that Half-Life 3 would make a good board game,

2309
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
assuming that the board game ever gets released.

2310
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Of course, Duke Nukem Forever, the board game will take forever to be released

2311
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
due to development hell.

2312
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Oh, you.

2313
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Steve Chiller says, Super Mario RPG.

2314
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
William Murderface says, Disgaea might make an interesting game.

2315
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
It could be sort of like Munchkin,

2316
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
but the combat would work a bit differently

2317
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
and the leveling system would be more detailed.

2318
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Also, C-Man might make an interesting game.

2319
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Maybe make it like Cards Against Humanity.

2320
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I'll friend your butt.

2321
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,000
It's a reference to an old YouTube joke on the show.

2322
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Tyler M says, There needs to be a Munchkin, Xbox Live,

2323
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,000
or PlayStation Network adaptation.

2324
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Shane, our good friend Shane Olinko from Horde House says,

2325
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Clearly, the correct answer is anticipation.

2326
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
It needs to have the limp ice cream cone and floppy horn.

2327
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Good answer. Good answer.

2328
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
A real answer would be Pokemon.

2329
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I don't think it would work so much

2330
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
as I'd really just want to see if they packaged in 649 pieces

2331
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
for every Pokemon in the series, excluding form changes.

2332
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
It's a card game already.

2333
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Chiggers, last but not least, says, Final Fantasy Tactics,

2334
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
a combo board and card game.

2335
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
For the record, you know there is a Mario monopoly, right?

2336
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
That's right.

2337
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
There's a Pokemon one, too. There's an everything monopoly.

2338
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Mario monopoly is just a monopoly.

2339
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
For the record, Rob, I've decided to do something,

2340
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
and I've given myself this idea.

2341
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
You know how you can make custom cards for Cards Against Humanity?

2342
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I'm going to do the OLR theme.

2343
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
With the print template and everything.

2344
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
That'll be fun.

2345
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
I should do that.

2346
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
That'll be a lot of fun.

2347
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
$50! No, I'm kidding.

2348
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Alright, that does it for the FOOGLE Question of the Week.

2349
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Friend us on Facebook at facebook.com slash OrangeLawnsRadio

2350
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
or add us on Google Plus.

2351
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Just search OrangeLawnsRadio on Google and we come right up.

2352
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
And there you go. You can answer next week.

2353
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Meanwhile, more news. Loki.

2354
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Yes, let's get into news.

2355
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,000
So, the Xbox One.

2356
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
They've got this reputation system that's going to be on the new system,

2357
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
and it's not entirely a new concept.

2358
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Basically, what they're going to be doing is

2359
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
they're going to be matching people with low reputation

2360
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,000
with other people of similar reputation.

2361
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,000
They have a similar system that was in Max Payne 3

2362
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
where it's kind of if people get caught cheating,

2363
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
they get put in a cheater's pool

2364
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
where all they encounter are people that hack the game

2365
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
and, you know, are cheaters.

2366
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
So, similar sense to that.

2367
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Although, I don't know if it's going to work exactly the same

2368
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
on the reputation system because

2369
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
your rating goes back up if you get...

2370
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
if no one really reports you.

2371
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Like, if they don't report you much.

2372
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
So, what's going to happen is you're going to have this yo-yo process

2373
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
where you get a low rep,

2374
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
and then you get put in the low rep pool,

2375
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
and then all the people with low rep aren't probably going to report each other,

2376
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
so your rep's going to go back up,

2377
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
and then you go back in their pool, and so on and so forth.

2378
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
But, hey, I guess it's better than nothing.

2379
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Here's my thing, though, is that

2380
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I thought this already was supposed to be there to some extent

2381
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
in the current Xbox.

2382
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I thought you were supposed to get massive assholes.

2383
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
They do have a reputation system in Xbox,

2384
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
so you can block people and stuff that you don't want to play with

2385
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
that are cheaters and stuff.

2386
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
But then again, I also have

2387
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
an 80% rating for unsportsmanlike conduct,

2388
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
but that's just because I kick the crap out of them.

2389
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
It's not because I talk trash, because I don't have a headset.

2390
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
It's just because I kick the crap out of them.

2391
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Mercifully.

2392
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Mercilessly, I guess.

2393
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
They...

2394
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
So you get false reports all the time.

2395
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I mean, my star rating's still high,

2396
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
but it's just...

2397
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Yeah, you gotta be careful.

2398
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
You get, especially if you're playing a lot,

2399
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
you get a lot of false ratings.

2400
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Somebody who uses this system a lot

2401
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
should have their vote weighed less

2402
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
than somebody who uses it sparingly,

2403
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
because you know they mean it when they use it sparingly, you know?

2404
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
But somebody who kind of overuses it?

2405
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I guess.

2406
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
There's gotta be, there's a fine system to it.

2407
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I don't know what the answer is.

2408
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I don't know.

2409
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
It would be, or like if they're like,

2410
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
you know, rating you for like,

2411
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I don't know, language or something like that.

2412
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
You don't have a headset connected or something.

2413
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
You know, maybe flag something going,

2414
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
hey, wait a second, how did they say anything to you

2415
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
without any sort of communication tool?

2416
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I don't know.

2417
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Whatever.

2418
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,000
I mean, I guess it's not a big deal

2419
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
unless, you know, a bunch of people gang up on something,

2420
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
but it's the same flaw in any system, I guess.

2421
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Well, remember the Wii Vitality Sensor?

2422
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
This was something that was shown at E3 a few years ago,

2423
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
and you know, Nintendo kind of made a big hoop to do about it.

2424
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
And it kind of disappeared.

2425
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
And that was a really poor showing.

2426
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
That whole year in general for Nintendo was not good news.

2427
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
And this thing kind of disappeared.

2428
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Well, news coming out this week

2429
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
about why the Wii Vitality Sensor disappeared.

2430
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
And this was in a conversation

2431
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
that Satoru Iwata had with investors.

2432
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Basically what it comes down to is that

2433
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
after doing a large test of the prototype,

2434
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
the peripheral apparently only worked on certain people.

2435
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,000
The success rate was 9 out of 10 people could use it.

2436
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
So, quote, we've pushed forward its development

2437
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
on the academic assumption that by observing the wave patterns

2438
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
of the human pulse, we could quantify

2439
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
how tense or relaxed a person is.

2440
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Or to be more specific, how much the sympathetic

2441
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
and parasympathetic nerves work as functions

2442
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
of the autonomic nerve.

2443
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
The Wii Vitality Sensor is an interesting device,

2444
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
and we did various experiments to see what is possible

2445
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
when it's combined with a video game.

2446
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
But as a result, we have not been able to launch it

2447
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
as a commercial product because we could not get it to work

2448
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
as we expected, and it was of narrower application

2449
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
than we originally thought.

2450
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
We would like to launch it into the market

2451
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
if technology advancements enable 999 out of 1,000 people

2452
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
to use it without any problems,

2453
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
not only 90 out of 100 people.

2454
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
So it makes me wonder, though, that if,

2455
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
you know, this doesn't work as well.

2456
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I wonder if, you know, the new Kinect

2457
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
is actually gonna work as well as they said.

2458
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
That's what I was thinking, because I thought the Kinect

2459
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
was supposed to have something like this in there.

2460
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Um, you know, I don't know, because...

2461
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Well, it's not like a monitor, but it's supposed to kind of see that.

2462
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
It's supposed to, like, see the pulse of your skin, I guess, but...

2463
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Mmm. Come on.

2464
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
And really, we know why this isn't working.

2465
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Merka, your fingers are too fucking fat.

2466
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Can't get your stump in there.

2467
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Uh, I'm not exactly sure what exciting games

2468
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
could have come of it anyway, except I could...

2469
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Zero. Zero games would have been exciting with that.

2470
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I could give myself an EKG at home.

2471
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:34,000
That's what it sounds like the Wii Vitality Sensor would be good for.

2472
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
What's next, the Wii Blood Pressure Monitor?

2473
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Like, just, I don't know, it was...

2474
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Wasn't feeling it, and I don't think many of us were.

2475
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
This is kind of one of those, you know, sometimes...

2476
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
You know what would get my vitality up?

2477
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Huh?

2478
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,000
If they re-released the Rez Trance?

2479
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
No.

2480
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
You know what would get my vitality up?

2481
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Sex.

2482
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Pinkberry.

2483
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Oh yeah, and Pinkberry.

2484
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?

2485
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I was actually trying to ask IkumaJP,

2486
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
what is the nasty tea you happen to have?

2487
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
But let's go to other news, speaking of nasty things.

2488
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Violent games.

2489
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Well, there's a study that came out that says

2490
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
they do not adversely affect pro-social behavior,

2491
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:22,000
meaning that they don't take regular, everyday social people

2492
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
and suddenly make them anti-social.

2493
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:29,000
This was a research that was conducted by

2494
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
University of Queensland, Australia,

2495
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:36,000
that concluded that playing violent video games

2496
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
really doesn't have an adverse effect on people,

2497
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
and I guess...

2498
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
I wouldn't say neurotypical mental states,

2499
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
but you know, basically, they're not gonna make

2500
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
an extroverted person suddenly introverted,

2501
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
and they're not gonna make an introverted person

2502
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
suddenly want to go on a murderous rampage.

2503
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:57,000
But they may make some lazy people not want to bathe

2504
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
if they're playing for a long time.

2505
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
How do you know this?

2506
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I'm just saying.

2507
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Anyway, the way that it goes is that each participant

2508
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
played one of four video games for 20 minutes,

2509
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,000
and at the end of the test, they had to drop some pens

2510
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
to see how many would pick them up.

2511
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
So no matter how many games they got these people to play,

2512
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
about 40 to 60% of them helped pick the pens back up

2513
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
at the end of the study.

2514
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,000
And then they found that participants were more likely

2515
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
to help when pens were dropped halfway through the experiment.

2516
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
So they basically said that it doesn't really affect

2517
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
your willingness to help other people.

2518
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:39,000
It doesn't affect your ability to interact with other people.

2519
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Pretty much, I think, it's like we've been saying all along,

2520
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:47,000
that has to already be there to have the adverse effect.

2521
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:52,000
And this was, you can find out from going to PLOS One.

2522
02:06:52,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I think that you can find the study if you search for it online.

2523
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,000
And I found this information out actually through Game Politics,

2524
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
so there's links following through that website as well.

2525
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
All right.

2526
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Let's see here.

2527
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Let's talk a little bit about advertisements.

2528
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:24,000
And one of the big criticisms that Microsoft gets with the Xbox 360 is,

2529
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
hey, you know what? I pay for Xbox Live Gold.

2530
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Why the fuck do I have advertisements on my console?

2531
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Why do I see this when I'm paying for my online already?

2532
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Well, it's not going to get any better.

2533
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:44,000
In fact, they are working on integrating Kinect functionality with ads.

2534
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Hooray!

2535
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
That's right.

2536
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
And one of the examples that they have in this wonderful picture here is for Ben Gay.

2537
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
That's right.

2538
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,000
You can use the Ben Gay campaign, or they had a campaign, I guess, that ran on 360.

2539
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:06,000
And they're saying that new ads, I guess, will support the Kinect somehow.

2540
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Voice recognition, I guess, maybe.

2541
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I'm wondering if they're going to have some sort of,

2542
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:19,000
because I know some of these videos I've seen before will have a way,

2543
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
instead of just hitting a button to skip it,

2544
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
it's like, type this word to skip this.

2545
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Or they may say this phrase to skip this thing.

2546
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,000
And then sometimes it's like the commercial slogan.

2547
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I saw that on a cap show the other day where it was like you had to type the little slogan

2548
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,000
of the company that was advertising, that was the cap show, was to type the slogan.

2549
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
That's so stupid.

2550
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
It's less irritating.

2551
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
It's clever as hell, actually.

2552
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:50,000
It's basically just to say that you saw the ad and that you saw it instead of just ignoring it.

2553
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
So, I don't know, I'm not too excited about that,

2554
02:08:54,000 --> 02:09:00,000
but obviously they're going to try to support the peripherals that are on there for that stuff.

2555
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,000
And I think they did some of that stuff with the Xbox 360.

2556
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Hell, they've crafted whole games based on advertisement.

2557
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Yars.

2558
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
And Doritos, I guess they have the Doritos stuff.

2559
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Yeah, the dash of destruction or whatever.

2560
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
But yeah, but one of those is good.

2561
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Princess Irene's favorite game.

2562
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,000
One of those is good, one of them's not, so yeah.

2563
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Alright, well, speaking of things that are good and not so good,

2564
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
depending on what side of the fence you're on,

2565
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
the controversial SimCity.

2566
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
I did want to add this quote at the very end there.

2567
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
It says, while advertising was more of an afterthought on the 360,

2568
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,000
the Xbox One is going to have advertising in mind.

2569
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Advertising in mind.

2570
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Not consumers in mind, advertising in mind.

2571
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
So the Xbox One is anti-consumer.

2572
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Yes.

2573
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Which is why Bobby Blackwolf pre-ordered one.

2574
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
So a lot of the limitations that we have now,

2575
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,000
hopefully the release of the boundaries will be widened

2576
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
so the opportunities will be elaborated, whatever the fuck that means.

2577
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
I don't know, but yeah.

2578
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Alright, anyhow.

2579
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
SimCity, which one might argue is also anti-consumer,

2580
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
at least a lot of people really felt that way.

2581
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
SimCity, you know, they said this game was not designed

2582
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
to be played as a single-player experience,

2583
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
not designed to be offline.

2584
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
This is a, it's a, what did they talk about,

2585
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,000
the new experience, it's part of the experience,

2586
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
it's what people want with SimCity.

2587
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Well, now take this with a grain of salt

2588
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
because it comes from a Reddit post of a customer survey

2589
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
that was being sent to SimCity players,

2590
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,000
but EA is thinking about an offline mode for the game.

2591
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
The survey lists several features, including a classic mode,

2592
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
which would allow you to, quote,

2593
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,000
in offline or online mode play a single,

2594
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
fully functioning city using cheats and unlocks

2595
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
that allow you to create your perfect city.

2596
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:47,000
So in other words, the game that most of us believe is actually SimCity.

2597
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:51,000
The poll also talks about expansions, DLC,

2598
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
something that would add super scrapers into the game,

2599
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:57,000
clean energy cities, green economies, and so forth.

2600
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,000
You can get screen caps of the survey on Imgur,

2601
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
which were posted via Reddit.

2602
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Again, I'm just saying this kind of stuff that doesn't,

2603
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
isn't really sourced except through screen caps, you know,

2604
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
you have to take with a grain of salt.

2605
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,000
But I think some of us certainly saw this coming

2606
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:18,000
where SimCity might kind of back end an offline mode into it,

2607
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
but charge for it.

2608
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I mean, let's just, it could be fake, it could be real,

2609
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
but we know for a fact that you can play it offline

2610
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
because people have hacked it to be able to play it offline.

2611
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,000
So a lot of the computations that they're offloading onto a server

2612
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
is just ridiculous.

2613
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I mean, your computer can handle that stuff.

2614
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
It's just, they still want an excuse to tie it to you.

2615
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:47,000
So just keep that in mind when you have these next gen games,

2616
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
and I'm not saying it's just an Xbox One thing,

2617
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
it's going to be PlayStation 4 as well,

2618
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
that require cloud computing for this shit to work

2619
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
because it probably could handle it on the system,

2620
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
but for whatever reason,

2621
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:03,000
they wanted that extra layer of connectivity or DRM.

2622
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
What happens when the servers go down?

2623
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Because they will go down.

2624
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Oh, you get delisted from Steam like Darkspore.

2625
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,000
SSG100Matt in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

2626
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Did they ask any questions about SimCity Action News?

2627
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,000
No, but I wish they would.

2628
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
That feature would be like Instabuy.

2629
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
If they could get that back in SimCity,

2630
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
the full motion video clips from the classic CD-ROM game,

2631
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I'd be there in a heartbeat.

2632
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
SSG100Matt asked the hard-hitting questions here at OLR.

2633
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I appreciate that.

2634
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,000
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

2635
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Every week you ask some hard-hitting questions in our mailbag.

2636
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

2637
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Darkspore will dive in the mailbag head first

2638
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
and read an email or two that she deems worthy.

2639
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Only got two.

2640
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Or you only get two emails the entire week

2641
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
and so it makes your job easy.

2642
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Yes, it does.

2643
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I'll read the first one.

2644
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Greetings, OLR.

2645
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2646
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Loki, I'm thinking about getting a 3DS soon,

2647
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
but the only thing holding me back

2648
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,000
is the lack of an R4 card that hasn't been patched out.

2649
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,000
The biggest thing I used my DS Lite for

2650
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
was homebrew and multimedia.

2651
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
So what do you think,

2652
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
someone will create a perma-hack for the 3DS

2653
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
and allow me to play my homebrew games?

2654
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I don't know.

2655
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,000
It's a little harder now that they can patch the system.

2656
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
You know, with the DS,

2657
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,000
they couldn't really patch it too easily at all, I think.

2658
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,000
So yeah, it's gonna be a lot harder.

2659
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
It's always gonna get harder with each generation.

2660
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
You said harder.

2661
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
No, I don't think they're gonna have

2662
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
any sort of permanent solution.

2663
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Keep the DS you've got for that stuff, if you can.

2664
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
All right, next part and a comment for Rob.

2665
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Yay.

2666
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
It finally happened.

2667
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Super Metroid for SNES has been bumped

2668
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
to my second favorite game of all time.

2669
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
What?

2670
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Stop reading this email.

2671
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I don't want to hear the rest.

2672
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,000
It's not official yet,

2673
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
but I think that Far Cry 3 might have replaced it.

2674
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I thought about breaking down

2675
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
and paying full price on Steam 50 bucks for the game

2676
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
when I remembered Loki saying that

2677
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Amazon usually has better sales on certain games.

2678
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
He was right.

2679
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,000
$20 for a hard copy and I am in business.

2680
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Usually in sandbox games,

2681
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I get a little bored with all the side missions,

2682
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
but the island is so beautiful and immersive

2683
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
and I've been doing everything there is to do.

2684
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I haven't even tried the multiplayer yet.

2685
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
So if you have a good graphics card, $20,

2686
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I highly recommend it.

2687
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
And please ask chat to comment

2688
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
if they like the multiplayer or not.

2689
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Thanks, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtles.

2690
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
You don't even need a really good graphics card

2691
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
for that game for some reason.

2692
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Like I have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon

2693
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,000
and it runs fine on my laptop.

2694
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
So much wrong with this email.

2695
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
First you say Super Metroid gets bumped to number two.

2696
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Then you use the phrase Loki was right.

2697
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
There's so much wrong with this email.

2698
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
I don't even know where to begin.

2699
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Hey, I agree Super Metroid is a better game

2700
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
than Far Cry 3.

2701
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Alright, you're a smart man, Loki.

2702
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
That's why we keep you around.

2703
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
But no, in all seriousness,

2704
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
I haven't played Far Cry 3.

2705
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
I can't hate on it.

2706
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Loki sure seems to enjoy it.

2707
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I got bored of it pretty fast, actually.

2708
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Oh, I thought you really liked it.

2709
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Blood Dragon was cool,

2710
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
but Blood Dragon was even kind of...

2711
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
It's just...

2712
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
It's very...

2713
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
You know, they have an open world,

2714
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
but it's kind of like,

2715
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
okay, takeover outpost.

2716
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Okay, hunt some animals.

2717
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Okay, you know, kill this dude.

2718
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
I don't know.

2719
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
It just got really boring for me,

2720
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
and I never finished it,

2721
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
so I probably should.

2722
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Although they have a really cool multiplayer mode.

2723
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Like, see, Far Cry was kind of cool

2724
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,000
on the consoles and PCs.

2725
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
You can make your own maps.

2726
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
But in 3, they got rid of the multiplayer

2727
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
where you can make your own maps.

2728
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
They have just like this single player,

2729
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
like sandbox thing that you can make some shit.

2730
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,000
So, I don't know.

2731
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Well, and here's the other thing,

2732
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
is that, you know,

2733
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
it's looking very likely

2734
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
we might have a Steam sale next week.

2735
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
You know, it's about that time of year.

2736
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
It should have started already,

2737
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
but it might be next Thursday.

2738
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
It doesn't show up by next Thursday.

2739
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,000
I thought they announced the date.

2740
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I think it's next weekend.

2741
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Yeah.

2742
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,000
So, there'll be that.

2743
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
And, you know, I know you said

2744
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
the good deals come from Amazon,

2745
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
but at this point,

2746
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Far Cry 3 on a Steam summer sale,

2747
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
if they put trading cards in it,

2748
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
it's over.

2749
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:02,000
They have like some really good bundles.

2750
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
You know, it's just like they had one.

2751
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
It was for 40 bucks.

2752
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
You get Bioshock Infinite,

2753
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Bioshock 2, and Bioshock 1.

2754
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
I already have one and two

2755
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
from previous Amazon sales,

2756
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
so I didn't get that,

2757
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
but, you know, that was a pretty good deal.

2758
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,000
And they've got some other games,

2759
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
but the problem is like,

2760
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
like I'm pretty limited now

2761
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
with what I'm buying on PC,

2762
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
because I have a ton of shit

2763
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
that I just don't play.

2764
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,000
So, you know, unless it's like,

2765
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,000
I don't even really know

2766
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
what else I really need.

2767
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff I have.

2768
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
It's just, I don't know,

2769
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Saints Row 4?

2770
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I mean, you know,

2771
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I'll get that eventually,

2772
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
but I don't really know what else I need.

2773
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Like I have all of,

2774
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I mean, Far Cry,

2775
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
or not Far Cry yet.

2776
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I mean, I have Far Cry 3.

2777
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I don't have Far Cry 3 on PC yet,

2778
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,000
but like Fallout, maybe Fallout.

2779
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I don't have the Fallout games yet,

2780
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
but I don't know if I'd have time to play that.

2781
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I mean, I'm assuming it's gonna be

2782
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
hundreds of hours just like Skyrim and shit,

2783
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
so I don't have time for that.

2784
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

2785
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,000
All right, next email.

2786
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Hey everyone.

2787
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
I just wanted to make this quick,

2788
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
short, and sweet.

2789
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Last week's episode of OLR reminded me

2790
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
of how much we are more of a family

2791
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
than anything else.

2792
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
You three were there for that listener

2793
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
as he was dealing with the loss of his wife.

2794
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
You three were also there for me

2795
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
when I had to deal with my passing of my mother

2796
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
along with everyone else

2797
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
that has been a long time listener.

2798
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
I'm inclined to say that Orange Lounge Radio

2799
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
is that chill big brother slash sister

2800
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,000
that we can come to for advice on dealing with anything

2801
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
and will not pass judgment on us,

2802
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
except me because I judge everybody.

2803
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Kidding.

2804
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
And speaking of passing judgment,

2805
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
two weeks ago with that unprofessional email

2806
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
that came in, as you recall,

2807
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
the entire chat room banded together

2808
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
and we were ready to lynch someone for it

2809
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
because we are family.

2810
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
We look out for each other.

2811
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Tell you what, though, I am ever grateful for Rob

2812
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
who helped me set up for my show

2813
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
right after my ex dumping me 15 minutes prior.

2814
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
And that's why I keep listening, supporting,

2815
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
and telling others to check out OLR.

2816
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Much love, Ron Chan.

2817
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I had no idea about that until after the fact, though.

2818
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,000
But I still would have helped you all the same.

2819
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Thank you.

2820
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,000
And big hearts to Ron Chan because my Ron Chan.

2821
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
And there's P.S.

2822
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Hey, Rob, what's the new OLR hashtag, wink?

2823
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:15,000
OLR love fest is the new hashtag, OLR love fest.

2824
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Not gonna lie to you guys,

2825
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
that was a very difficult call at the end of last week's show.

2826
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Probably one of the toughest, if not the toughest,

2827
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I've taken in the, what, 11, 12 years we've been here.

2828
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
But he needed a friend

2829
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:34,000
and I was so happy to see that there's like 70 of them

2830
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,000
in the chat room and countless more on the podcast feed.

2831
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
So, yeah, that really is what it's all about.

2832
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
And you guys, you know, it's not just us for you guys.

2833
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
We've shared some pretty personal stories

2834
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
over the past few years of this show as well.

2835
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,000
We've had, you know, not every day of Sunshine and Roses

2836
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
at Studio OLR.

2837
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
But we get through it.

2838
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Here we are.

2839
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Yep.

2840
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
All these years later.

2841
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Still going.

2842
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
And just think, I get to pay 400,000 real bells for a house.

2843
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
No, I'm kidding.

2844
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
No, not that much actually.

2845
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
PPS, two tacos for Uchan.

2846
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Heart.

2847
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I want a taco.

2848
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I want tacos too.

2849
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Did I tell you, I told you Rob,

2850
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,000
the real estate lady who took us around to all these houses

2851
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:20,000
and got us this good deal on this house, bought us pizza.

2852
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Cause she wanted to sell you that house.

2853
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
She was a nice lady.

2854
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
She was legit nice.

2855
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
She knew the way to get your attention.

2856
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
And she brought us drinks.

2857
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
P-I-Z-Z-A.

2858
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,000
But champagne would have definitely sold more houses.

2859
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I'm just saying.

2860
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
All right.

2861
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
I'm going to have a mimosa party if we get this house by the way.

2862
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Bottomless mimosas?

2863
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Heck yeah.

2864
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I'm there.

2865
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Bring us champagne.

2866
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
All right.

2867
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
After the hashtag OLR love fest is a very appropriate time

2868
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
to bring us back down to earth with some FUs of the week.

2869
02:19:51,000 --> 02:20:11,000
F-U to this damn cough that will not go the fuck away.

2870
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Fuck you.

2871
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Fuck you.

2872
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Fuck you.

2873
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Fuck you.

2874
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Fuck you.

2875
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Fuck you.

2876
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Fuck you.

2877
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Fuck you.

2878
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Fuck you.

2879
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
I like that.

2880
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
And my toes are hurting.

2881
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
And um, yeah.

2882
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
And girl problems.

2883
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Loki.

2884
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Fuck you, the long weekend is gone.

2885
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Amen to that.

2886
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Fuck you to the heat.

2887
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Fuck you to Grandpa for living in San Francisco where the weather

2888
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
was beautiful the whole time we stayed.

2889
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,000
We went over there for a concert on Wednesday.

2890
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
And um, Frank music.

2891
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:54,000
He puts on a great show by the way.

2892
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,000
He's a very talented young man.

2893
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Um, we stayed over at his place and the weather was just great.

2894
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Back here it's hotter than balls.

2895
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
So F you to the heat.

2896
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Other locals say?

2897
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Hmm.

2898
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Thank God the heat wave is over.

2899
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Because what hasn't it been nice the last couple of nights?

2900
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Yeah, it's much better.

2901
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Yeah, this week's OLR much more tolerable than last week.

2902
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,000
I don't think Slidekick will ever come back.

2903
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
It was so hot here.

2904
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Now you just brought the heat with him?

2905
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,000
That's right.

2906
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Girl, you need to leave that heat at home.

2907
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Because he's just a hot mess.

2908
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
I hope he's listening.

2909
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Gameboy.org.

2910
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Yes, artichokes are good on pizza.

2911
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Shut up.

2912
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Artichoke hearts.

2913
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Alright, let us move on with a couple more news stories for you guys.

2914
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,000
And then Twitter topics and the Skype line.

2915
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
But first, Loki.

2916
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Alright, so Sony during their press conference actually,

2917
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:49,000
and during E3, they were showing off this kind of augmented reality tech demo

2918
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:54,000
to show off the PlayStation 4 and the new iCamera.

2919
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Well, what's kind of cool, this tech demo called Playroom

2920
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:05,000
is actually going to be included with the PlayStation 4 system.

2921
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:12,000
And the only weird thing though is that the iCamera is not included with the system.

2922
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:15,000
So I don't really know how you're going to deal with augmented reality stuff.

2923
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I guess it's an excuse to buy the camera.

2924
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I personally, if it were me, I would just throw that tech demo in with the camera

2925
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:29,000
and not necessarily the system so that, you know, you have something with the camera

2926
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
that you play games with.

2927
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I don't know.

2928
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Maybe some of the demos in there don't necessarily use the camera.

2929
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
I don't know.

2930
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,000
It looks neat though. It kind of makes me want to get a camera too.

2931
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
That's enough to sell you on the whole?

2932
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:50,000
That looks neat. I mean, I don't know.

2933
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,000
I don't know. I need to see more games that really make good use of it.

2934
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Although, the move is kind of underrated.

2935
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,000
As far as the motion stuff goes, the move works very well.

2936
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Have you used the move?

2937
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Yeah, I have.

2938
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
All the way back at E3 once even.

2939
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Toy Story was one of the first games I played.

2940
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
I think the first game I played on the move.

2941
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
And somebody else I knew had one.

2942
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
One more news story for you guys.

2943
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
It's about Nintendo on the losing end of a lawsuit.

2944
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:27,000
They actually filed a domain dispute with the World Intellectual Property Organization

2945
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:30,000
over the WiiU.com domain name.

2946
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Now Nintendo does own Wii-U.com and Wii-U.net.

2947
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:41,000
But an unknown, or at least they're unnamed, registrant snapped up WiiU.com in 2004.

2948
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Long before even the first Wii.

2949
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Nintendo filed a cyber squatting camp complaint.

2950
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:51,000
The WIPO denied that complaint.

2951
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Nintendo will have to contact WiiU.com's owner directly to negotiate a purchase.

2952
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Microsoft, by the way, in a similar domain dispute with Xbox One.com and Xbox One.net's domains.

2953
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,000
So, it gets harder to get these domains.

2954
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,000
The people just snap up and they sit on them.

2955
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
So, Nintendo tried with the cyber squatting.

2956
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:17,000
I'd like to hear more about why it was denied.

2957
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
I mean, what's on that site?

2958
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:20,000
What was denied?

2959
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Well, WiiU stood for, was like, we invest in you, is what it was.

2960
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:29,000
And it was, it's from a long time ago that the guy registered the site.

2961
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Yeah, but now it's just a bunch of, it's ads.

2962
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
I'm looking at the site now.

2963
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,000
This is totally, this is like a squat ad thing.

2964
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I don't get, like, why is this here?

2965
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Well, they tried, I understand that, but it's still his site.

2966
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:48,000
And the thing was, they were trying to take it, saying basically that he's just squatting on the name and stuff like that.

2967
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:54,000
But it's legitimately, he registered it a long time ago, it wasn't to try to make a quick buck and stuff.

2968
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:02,000
But, so now they can't necessarily get it just by saying, oh well, it should be turned over to us because it's infringing on our copyrights or anything like that.

2969
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Now they have to basically go the second route, which is offer big sum of cash to buy it.

2970
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Yeah, but this, I get what you're saying, but this shit's shady.

2971
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,000
He's not using it now for that purpose.

2972
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:17,000
So give it up, because this is profiting off of Nintendo's.

2973
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Nintendo has built the name recognition.

2974
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,000
This guy, with this page here, this is profiting off it.

2975
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:30,000
If I went to WiiU.com and saw, you know, Wii financial investment, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, and this guy's thing, you know, things not tied to video games,

2976
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:34,000
I'd be like, okay, you know, sucks for Nintendo, but this guy, this guy had it first, you know?

2977
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
And it's just like, it's just like, you know, OLR.

2978
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
We probably don't own OLR.com.

2979
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
I don't know, who does own OLR.com?

2980
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,000
What is there if I go there?

2981
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Remember when we had the sacramentals back in the day as our DDR group?

2982
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Okay, OLR.com belongs to this online residential and it's something to do with New York and getting places in New York.

2983
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
It's hard for me to complain about this.

2984
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Somebody's not sitting on this profiting off of, you know, here's every annoying rant Rob's ever made with ads attached to it or something.

2985
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Like they're not profiting off of something we did, you know, it just happens to be that OLR is a pretty common acronym that means a few different things.

2986
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:16,000
So this online residential has it. So can't really complain about that, you know?

2987
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:23,000
My point was with the sacramental thing is that when I tried to register it, it belonged to some Catholic group in Sacramento.

2988
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Oh, that's right. That's right.

2989
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Yeah.

2990
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Remember that.

2991
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
All right.

2992
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Also word of warning, Animal Crossing will not let you say fart face or ass face or arse face.

2993
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Really?

2994
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,000
As anybody's catchphrase.

2995
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Oh.

2996
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:41,000
But you can't get biatch, mared, and zoot.

2997
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
How about bish?

2998
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,000
I haven't tried it.

2999
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:49,000
I did get, I got one of my, Brie or one of my characters to say LOL butts.

3000
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,000
I have to try that one.

3001
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Yeah. LOL butts.

3002
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Pretty good.

3003
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Surely you saw on Tumblr the person that named their town My Butt.

3004
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Yeah.

3005
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Hilarious.

3006
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:02,000
This will be the best renovation in my butt.

3007
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,000
He lives in my butt.

3008
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:06,000
All right.

3009
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
We're five.

3010
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Okay.

3011
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Let's get to the Skype line.

3012
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Let's open it up.

3013
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,000
One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

3014
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:18,000
If you'd like to give us a call and talk about whatever we've talked about tonight or maybe something different.

3015
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
We are open now for your calls.

3016
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:25,000
We'll get to Twitter topics here in a minute if there's no calls coming in right away.

3017
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:29,000
But first, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories you want to share with listeners.

3018
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Just some stuff I saw online.

3019
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:36,000
They've got a villager mod now for Skyrim.

3020
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:40,000
So you can play as the villager from Animal Crossing.

3021
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Murder people and that.

3022
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
That's kind of awesome actually.

3023
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
In a creepy way.

3024
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
So I'm going to point it out in chat.

3025
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:55,000
There's going to be a 2D Mega Man game based off of Mega Man Legends 3.

3026
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:00,000
I know they've had quite a few Mega Man Legends based games.

3027
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:09,000
They're a part of that 100,000 for bringing back Mega Man thing.

3028
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
I don't know.

3029
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,000
What else?

3030
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
I don't know.

3031
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
It's pretty much it.

3032
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
I mean, like I said, slow news week.

3033
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Very slow.

3034
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:24,000
So not a whole lot to report out there.

3035
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
It's too bad.

3036
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,000
All right.

3037
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Again, it's 1877 Game O-L-R.

3038
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

3039
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Meanwhile, I will move on.

3040
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Maybe Skype's having problems though.

3041
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Because I know when Bobby tried to call us earlier, we didn't even show up on Skype.

3042
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I assure you we are on Skype.

3043
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Just call the name.

3044
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
If it's not working, I guess you could send us a message.

3045
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Although please don't make 20 bazillion messages show up on my screen at once.

3046
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,000
That really annoys me when people send me messages when I'm trying to do a show.

3047
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
No offense.

3048
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Let's see.

3049
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I was going to get to Twitter topics, but I got sidetracked with a personal tweet.

3050
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Where am I here?

3051
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Rab.

3052
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I can't help it if I love Twitter.

3053
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Oh, yes.

3054
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Oh, God.

3055
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Tigerclaw sent us one.

3056
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
I know this is going to come up on Horde House this week.

3057
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Tigerclaw sent us this tweet.

3058
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Blizzard exploring microtransactions for World of Warcraft.

3059
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,000
He links this to an article on GameSpot, but I can summarize this.

3060
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:32,000
They datamined an item in the latest patch of Warcraft that increases your experience gain by 300% for a short amount of time.

3061
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:35,000
And it says, from the Blizzard net cash shop.

3062
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
But here's the thing.

3063
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:40,000
It came out, I think just today or yesterday, it's for Asia.

3064
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Asia is the region that this is for.

3065
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:45,000
It's not for America, at least not yet.

3066
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:52,000
But I really hope Blizzard is either going to just say, fuck it, and go free to play, and they're not going to double dip.

3067
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Because that is going to piss me off.

3068
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Like, if they try to double dip, I'm done with WoW.

3069
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
They got free to play would be interesting.

3070
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:08,000
They are already walking a fine line, because you can't tell me they don't make some good money off of mounts, server transfers, faction changes, blah-di-blah-di-blah.

3071
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Like, they make a heck of a lot of good money off of that stuff, and they're already walking a fine line.

3072
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:21,000
The minute they start putting stuff in that enhances gameplay and gives people an edge, as opposed to cosmetic stuff, I'm kind of over it.

3073
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:29,000
And I know some WoW fans are looking forward to this, but I'm not willing to pay a sub-fee and money for advantage gaining things on top of that.

3074
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
That's too much.

3075
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Choose one model and go for it.

3076
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:36,000
You don't get to do both, especially when your game is aging.

3077
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,000
By the way, I did get into the beta test of the new battle.net launcher.

3078
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
That was pretty cool.

3079
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:51,000
I will say, the new battle.net launcher that has all the games in there, and you can just, like, it actually, I'm going to spoil something that's going to come up on this week's Horde House, but oh well, don't tell.

3080
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,000
So we talked about it a little bit on last week's show.

3081
02:30:54,000 --> 02:31:00,000
I guess after last week's show, Grandpa side-loaded Starcraft, because you can get the free version of Starcraft right there in the launcher.

3082
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
He ended up buying it, and the expansion.

3083
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:06,000
He enjoyed the little free version of it so much, he bought the whole thing.

3084
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Wow.

3085
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:13,000
So I'm like, wow, battle.net launcher justified, just wait until they add the free-to-play Hearthstone into the mix.

3086
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
It's going to just download right on your computer.

3087
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,000
I'm still not probably going back to WoW, not for a while.

3088
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Well, there's a lot of people that aren't playing WoW right now, which is sad.

3089
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:26,000
But we have pretty games, like Final Fantasy XIV, that actually have a balanced system.

3090
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
And no grinding rep.

3091
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I'm enjoying some single-player action right now, so whatever.

3092
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
No grinding rep.

3093
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Alright, let's see what else I have here.

3094
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Oh, ActDeaf tweeted us and says, after the Atari talk, I went and found my 2600.

3095
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Don't know if it works though.

3096
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Actually, that joystick you have, though, looks like my old Commodore 64 joystick.

3097
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Also, if I may say, because he messaged me on Twitter, I won't give any more information than this, but Micah is who I spoke with.

3098
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Spoke to at Atari Party, who had the Japanese 3DS, and very, very cool.

3099
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Very lucky kids, having a cool dad like that.

3100
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Spazzernator PSN tweets us, saying, we need VOG Magic 2013 or 2014 game night on Steam.

3101
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:15,000
He's been trying to whore that game left and right. He must really love that game.

3102
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
What is the next game night? Have you picked something yet, Loki?

3103
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Oh God, I keep, I keep, what is that, last, last, or this Friday, it was a little big playing card game.

3104
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
There was nobody on.

3105
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:30,000
And last week, I mean, honestly, I forgot, but I don't even know.

3106
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I don't know what we're going to do for next week, and I don't even know if we're going to continue doing it, because I'm just, I'm...

3107
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Participation's not at a level you need to be at.

3108
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Well, it's participation, and on top of that, well, it's because Bobby's PS3 broke, so we at least have two, you know.

3109
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:52,000
But no, honestly, it was like, we got home late, and you know, by the time I got Josh in bed, it was like 9 o'clock, and so it's just...

3110
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Friday's a rough night, it's tough.

3111
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I wouldn't mind if you did VOG game night during Hoard House. If you wanted to do Wednesday, I wouldn't mind that, actually.

3112
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
We could hop in as soon as we're done.

3113
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I do still stream Mass Effect 3 on Thursdays, I just didn't because it was the fourth.

3114
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:11,000
I just, I don't know, it's hard to pick like a game that everybody has, and it's something we can consistently play, so...

3115
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:14,000
I don't know, I'll have to think about it a little bit more.

3116
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,000
It's too bad Minecraft wasn't free to play.

3117
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,000
I was going to say, we need to do a Minecraft night, I'm kind of surprised.

3118
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:29,000
I have the server access stuff, I just haven't gone around to updating the server and getting what mods we want in there.

3119
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:33,000
But they have horses now, and you can put horse armor on them.

3120
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
So, hey, horses.

3121
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I want guinea pig armor.

3122
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:48,000
I will point out, we have a VOG community in the Steam group, and to be fair, we have an OLR community on Steam too, but I'm saying VOG because I'm trying to grow that one for all the shows.

3123
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Because I need people to trade cards with.

3124
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:56,000
So if you want to trade some cards, you want to throw down and trade some cards, get in that VOG community and let's trade some cards.

3125
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
For what games do you need cards?

3126
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I need two more for Super Meat Boy, but I have nothing to trade yet.

3127
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Well, I have Faerie Solitaire, like one Faerie Solitaire card I have dupes of that I'm willing to trade at this point.

3128
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Because I don't want to trade it if I don't have dupes.

3129
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Ask me again when I start getting booster packs.

3130
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Alright, I guess I'll just have to start playing.

3131
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
There you go.

3132
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Where's the list for this stuff?

3133
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Attaboy, attaboy.

3134
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:18,000
I guess I'll have to start playing because I haven't played Super Meat Boy yet, and I haven't, but I just haven't played it.

3135
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Who posted the link earlier in chat? Post that again.

3136
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
There's actually a sort in the marketplace.

3137
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:30,000
You sort advanced search, games, and then there's a one in the bottom right where it says like Steam achievements.

3138
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,000
There's also trading cards.

3139
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
It'll show you what games use it, but it's in the store.

3140
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
It doesn't show you what games you own that use it.

3141
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:42,000
But I think if you go to your profile and look at badges, I think any games that you have will show up there with the empty cards.

3142
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Like you have Super Meat Boy, right?

3143
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Yeah.

3144
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
So you should see Super Meat Boy with the blank cards there.

3145
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,000
So.

3146
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Alright.

3147
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Alright, I'll tell you some more stuff about that off air that I think you'll enjoy.

3148
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,000
So.

3149
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Alright.

3150
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Nobody's calling in? That's really weird.

3151
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
I wonder if Skype is screwing up something because...

3152
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
It's probably Skype.

3153
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Yeah, because Bobby was having those problems earlier where he didn't even see us.

3154
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:09,000
I'm gonna call the nice British lady on Skype just to make sure it's working.

3155
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Just testing.

3156
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Hello, welcome to Skype Core Testing Service.

3157
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Alright.

3158
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Yeah, we got it.

3159
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,000
We got it.

3160
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,000
We're good.

3161
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Hello.

3162
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
It is the 4th of July weekend.

3163
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Our chat's got 61 people in it right now.

3164
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Are any of them trying to call?

3165
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Yeah, is anyone trying?

3166
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
No, nobody's complaining.

3167
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Maybe there's just nothing to say tonight.

3168
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I don't know.

3169
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Where every gamer has a voice, but not tonight.

3170
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,000
That's cool.

3171
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
We can go home early.

3172
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
That's fine.

3173
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I can start playing that Super Meat Boy later in those cards.

3174
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,000
There you go.

3175
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Alright, fine.

3176
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Fine.

3177
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:46,000
If you guys don't want to call in, we will go off and earn our trading cards.

3178
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I'll make the grudge noise until someone calls.

3179
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Oh, God no.

3180
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I'll end the show.

3181
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
End the show.

3182
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Turn it off for Mike.

3183
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Oh, look, look, look.

3184
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:56,000
It's finally lighting up.

3185
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Somebody's taking pity on this program.

3186
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

3187
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Who's this?

3188
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
It is Brad from Bot Culture.

3189
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Hey, Brad.

3190
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,000
How you doing?

3191
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Oh, peachy game.

3192
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Oh, and of course, now that you call, like the minute Dark Soccer started making noises.

3193
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:14,000
As soon as Dark Soccer started making noises, my screen is full of calls.

3194
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Please stop.

3195
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Please stop.

3196
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:17,000
What?

3197
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Somebody had to call.

3198
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Somebody had to call.

3199
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I love your kitty.

3200
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Well, good.

3201
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,000
You know what?

3202
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:27,000
We don't promote the fine show that is Pod Culture here on the show enough, and you do

3203
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:32,000
so much for our program, and you've done a lot for Horde House that I'm always happy

3204
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:36,000
to sit down and talk with you for a minute about what's going on in Pod Culture.

3205
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Well, outside of cat the game this week.

3206
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Yeah?

3207
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Been playing a lot of the 3DS this week.

3208
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Oh, yes.

3209
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
You got sucked into the animal cracking, didn't you?

3210
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Yes, I did.

3211
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Dammit.

3212
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Congrats.

3213
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:55,000
We've been playing that, and Lego City Undercover.

3214
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Oh, how's that?

3215
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,000
It's a lot of fun.

3216
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
It's Grand Theft Auto with Legos.

3217
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
It's great.

3218
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
That sounds kind of fun.

3219
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:05,000
All the Lego games are pretty much the same.

3220
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:08,000
I'm surprised Loki is not all over that game if it's Grand Theft Auto.

3221
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,000
You could teach Josh on that.

3222
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:13,000
It was going to be a game that was going to sell me the console, but I just looked at

3223
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:14,000
him like, no.

3224
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:15,000
No.

3225
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,000
It's a lot of fun.

3226
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:22,000
I don't know if it would be a system seller, but it's one picking it up.

3227
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,000
That's a nice little addition then.

3228
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
What else have you been playing in the gaming?

3229
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
You doing any consoles these days?

3230
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,000
No.

3231
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Nope.

3232
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,000
That's all right.

3233
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,000
I am fun employed at the moment.

3234
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
That'll do it.

3235
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
It's been your day when it comes to consoles.

3236
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Well, good luck on that front.

3237
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:40,000
We're all hoping for you and Dark Sakura.

3238
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,000
We're the gamelessly fun employed.

3239
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Well, I am going to let you guys go.

3240
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:48,000
I just wanted to see if I could actually get in.

3241
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Hey, before you go, before you hang up and go, tell us a little bit about Pod Culture,

3242
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:57,000
your show that's on Mondays at six o'clock on the network.

3243
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Just four geeks sitting around shooting the shit.

3244
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Good times.

3245
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:04,000
You guys also do once a month lately, or at least for this year,

3246
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
you're doing Doctor Who based specials, right?

3247
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Yeah.

3248
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
It's kind of a sideshow for us.

3249
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Have another couple of friends that come in,

3250
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:15,000
and we just talk Doctor Who on our Tartar's Interruptus episodes.

3251
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:20,000
We thought for, hey, 2013, it's the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who.

3252
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:24,000
We do a show for every doctor each month, and that's kind of what we've been doing.

3253
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,000
All right.

3254
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Love it and love your show, and thanks so much for the support

3255
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
and for calling in when nobody else would, Brad.

3256
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Appreciate it.

3257
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Later, guys.

3258
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Take care, buddy.

3259
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:35,000
You could tell he just wanted to call in because he felt bad.

3260
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
I appreciate that, Brad.

3261
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Black Wolf giving us a little last-minute leg-breaking story in the chat room.

3262
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Infinity Blade 2 free in the App Store right now.

3263
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:48,000
If you want to go just tag that on your iPhone or iPad or whatever iDevice you're using.

3264
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
I like free. It's the best price ever.

3265
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Oh, do I still have your mic off? I do.

3266
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
God, Rob, you suck.

3267
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Fired.

3268
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:56,000
That was funny.

3269
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,000
That was not funny.

3270
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,000
That was totally funny.

3271
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,000
That was not funny.

3272
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
All right.

3273
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Anyhow, let's go to the phones and try to take another call.

3274
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3275
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Who's this?

3276
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Hey, this is Agdef.

3277
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Hey, Agdef.

3278
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,000
What's up?

3279
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Well, I don't know if you touched this story today or tonight.

3280
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Iwata telling people why he doesn't lay off people.

3281
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:24,000
No, we didn't touch on that, but I read about that.

3282
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Please go ahead and share that with the listeners.

3283
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Basically, Iwata said to some reporters, I don't remember who exactly,

3284
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:41,000
but they asked him because Nintendo is in the best financial position right now,

3285
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:44,000
that why they don't lay off people.

3286
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:51,000
So he basically says that laying off people would lower the morale of the rest

3287
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:58,000
and would produce not quality games, basically.

3288
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:05,000
And I admire that because even despite the financial problems

3289
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Nintendo has right now, not laying off people just because they want to produce quality stuff,

3290
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
it's pretty good.

3291
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:18,000
I don't know if it's fair to say Nintendo has, quote, financial problems either.

3292
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:21,000
I know that's what a lot of people out on the internet are saying,

3293
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
but Nintendo's got a shit ton of cash in the bank.

3294
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
They made a lot of money on the Wii.

3295
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
The 3DS is still crazy good for them.

3296
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Is the Wii U living up to expectations?

3297
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:30,000
No.

3298
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:34,000
But is it an epic loss of biblical proportions?

3299
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Not yet.

3300
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
Let's see where they're at after this holiday.

3301
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,000
But I love that Iwata gets that, you know, I could lay people off,

3302
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,000
but that's only going to help the short-term numbers, not the long-term numbers.

3303
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:47,000
If I lay people off, where are the people to make games?

3304
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Indeed.

3305
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
I love it.

3306
02:40:49,000 --> 02:41:05,000
And especially because I think it was last year that he caught his salary by half of what he was making.

3307
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I remember that a lot.

3308
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:11,000
And other people in Nintendo at the higher staff.

3309
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:15,000
That was pretty cool of him and the rest of the Nintendo staff, too,

3310
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:23,000
because despite what happens in Senga or other gaming companies,

3311
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:27,000
it's cool that people at Nintendo, at least in Japan,

3312
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:31,000
we know if the same happens here in America,

3313
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:38,000
that they have at least a secure job there.

3314
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:46,000
They don't have to worry about getting laid off just because they are not making any money, or just because.

3315
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Right.

3316
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Doomplague in chat says, I think Kazurai laid it off a ton of people last year.

3317
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Just saying.

3318
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Yeah, I remember some of the publicists, especially in Santa Monica.

3319
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
There was some pretty big layoffs at Sony.

3320
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
And of course, Microsoft.

3321
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:02,000
We talked about Game Room earlier in the show and so forth.

3322
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Layoffs are inevitable as part of the ebb and flow of the industry,

3323
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:11,000
but it's nice to know that Nintendo is not the first option on the top of their list.

3324
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:14,000
And unfortunately for some executives, that's usually the first thing considered.

3325
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Yeah, it's really the executives that should be taking the pay cut,

3326
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:21,000
because they're the ones that are making the decisions that are leading to the bad.

3327
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
But again, Nintendo did.

3328
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:28,000
So hate on Nintendo all you want, but it's pretty hard to get mad at this.

3329
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:31,000
I just wish other people would follow that example.

3330
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Alright, well, Act Deft, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

3331
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:38,000
No, that's all. Basically, good guy eat water.

3332
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:39,000
What's that?

3333
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Good guy eat water.

3334
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Oh yeah, good on you. A thumbs up for you, Iwata.

3335
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Alright, and a thumbs up for you too, Act Deft.

3336
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
I appreciate the phone call. You take care, buddy.

3337
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,000
You too. Thanks.

3338
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Bye. And have fun with that Atari 2600.

3339
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Hope it works.

3340
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,000
I will. I try.

3341
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Hope it works. Bye.

3342
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:01,000
I don't know how easy it is to find Atari 2600 games in Mexico, Act Deft,

3343
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:06,000
but if you go to flea markets here in the US, oh, they're all over the place.

3344
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:09,000
I probably have spares I could send you.

3345
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:12,000
You can't find a copy of Combat somewhere?

3346
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
You saying you can't find a copy of Combat?

3347
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Alright, sadly we are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

3348
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but you know what?

3349
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:22,000
You should have called when you had the chance.

3350
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Appreciate it though.

3351
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,000
You can always send us an email.

3352
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3353
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:29,000
if you'd like to send us an email for consideration for next week.

3354
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:32,000
But in the meantime, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.

3355
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Dark Sakura, sorry you couldn't be here for the whole show tonight,

3356
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,000
but I'm glad you had fun at Atari Party.

3357
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,000
I really rushed it.

3358
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:43,000
We finally actually ended up cutting out six houses so that we could go look at this one

3359
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:47,000
because I'd had my eye on it the whole time, and it turns out to be the one.

3360
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Nice. Have a mountain of fun at California Extreme.

3361
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
I wish you could come.

3362
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Get us some more listeners for the show.

3363
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I've been spreading the news.

3364
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Appreciate it.

3365
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:58,000
And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3366
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:01,000
I hate my lungs and I want this house.

3367
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Good luck.

3368
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3369
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:09,000
I don't know.

3370
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:14,000
I learned a lot about the Runswick A2 Pin Setter this week.

3371
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:19,000
And my final thought tonight is trading cards.

3372
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Give me all your trading cards.

3373
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:25,000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3374
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Thank you guys so much for checking out the show.

3375
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
You know what we say. We do the show for free.

3376
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:30,000
We're not asking for your money.

3377
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:34,000
If you enjoy the show, all we ask, help spread the word about the show.

3378
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Help spread the word about independent podcasting.

3379
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Support folks like us who do this for nothing but the pure love of community

3380
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:46,000
and spreading the word out there and having mature discussions about gaming.

3381
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Support the Voice of Geeks Network.

3382
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
All our friends at vognetwork.com.

3383
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:55,000
But even beyond that, all the great independent hardworking podcasters out there.

3384
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
And there's an awful lot of them that are, especially in the gaming world,

3385
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:01,000
that are getting to 8, 9, 10 years old that are all doing amazing things out there.

3386
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:04,000
And yeah, support. Don't cut people down.

3387
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Support. If you don't like our show, that's fine.

3388
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
You got this far.

3389
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
So we appreciate you trying.

3390
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Go support a different independent broadcaster who works hard like we do

3391
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
because there might be another show that's a little more up your alley.

3392
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:18,000
That's the great thing about diversity all over the internet.

3393
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:22,000
You can buy my momentary silence, though, with a copy of Magical Chase.

3394
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Just saying for the TurboGrafx. Just saying.

3395
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
How much does that run?

3396
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:28,000
A few hundred.

3397
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Yeah. That's what I thought.

3398
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:34,000
All right. We'll be back to do it all again next week on Orange Lawn Radio.

3399
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Dark Soccer will have a report from California Extreme.

3400
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:39,000
If I find a way to sneak over there, I'll have to do it.

3401
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
And hopefully Dan will join us for that one.

3402
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Yeah. He was going to be here tonight.

3403
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:46,000
It was, but he actually got called in to do inventory at work.

3404
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
And we've been crunching his numbers, actually.

3405
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:52,000
I would have been here slightly a bit earlier if it wasn't that I was checking on what the taxes are on that house.

3406
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Gotcha.

3407
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Well, I look forward to hopefully having him here next week

3408
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
because we've had a lot of fun guests lately.

3409
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:02,000
So let's get Dan, who's one of the most funnest.

3410
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Well, I married him. There had to be something good about him.

3411
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,000
I'm still looking.

3412
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
All right. That does it, guys. Have a great week.

3413
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,000
And we'll see you next time here at Orange Lawn Radio. Good night.
