10149	14754	Sky, and Loki.
14794	19598	Tonight, July 28th, 2013, self-publishing will soon be a reality on the Xbox.
19959	23082	A report is in on Ouya game sales, which might surprise you.
23442	27346	And we get more insight as to why one fan-anticipated game was cancelled.
32150	37195	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37275	45543	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this July the 28th of 2013, episode number 514 of our show.
45884	49207	We're here to talk to you guys about the latest and greatest in video gaming.
49247	50869	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
51249	56214	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
56414	57195	TechMasterLoki
77537	77857	Hello!
77877	79118	How you doing Techmaster Loki?
79819	80739	I'm getting full though.
80839	81520	You're getting full?
81540	82561	I still have another burger.
82781	84222	Another burger to down.
84302	86924	Oh yeah, that's right, you've ditched your fries in favor of two burgers.
86944	87484	Well, not today.
87725	90527	I actually wanted to get fries today just because I was a little hungry.
90547	92188	You're being a little bit of a piggy today.
93509	94410	But they're good fries.
94650	96231	Usually they're not good fries.
96331	102375	It's kind of the Russian roulette of drive-thru fast food, I guess.
103316	103977	McDonald's fries.
104677	114930	Alright, and of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
115470	120036	And when you do listen to our show live, you can check in and show that you're participating with the show.
120456	121758	I did just turn those on.
121798	123620	Sorry, I'm lagging a little bit tonight.
124321	140961	You guys might have to carry the show a little bit tonight I am pooped I had a super long weekend this weekend We don't want to know about your poop I may not have gone poop all weekend I've been that busy Are you that uptight?
141782	142543	No, but okay.
142563	143764	Sounds like a personal problem, Rob.
143944	144744	Well, here's the thing.
145305	154652	As Jamie referenced a minute ago, last night was the big clue show, and I'm sure those of you that do listen to Understation Live here at the Voice Geeks Network, you've probably heard Jessica talking about it, and I've referenced it too.
155192	163839	That was the big show last night, which, you know, not only was the show, but all day leading up to that show, and then all week leading up to the show, and the Saturdays before that.
164159	165240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
188079	215675	um so there was that and then this morning um my buddies uh Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick and and Tim from Crystal D were all here and they um graciously let me guest on a Game Buoy podcast we used the studio here to do that so I've already done one three-hour podcast today so now there's this there was Clue yesterday there was it's like I had Friday off of work and it still wasn't enough because I kind of want to call in tomorrow um
216255	217115	Yeah, me too.
217715	219216	Aren't you starting your job tomorrow?
219396	219676	Yes.
220096	220996	No.
222676	226857	So yeah, so I took a Tylenol PM last night, which I don't usually do.
227317	229438	And so I'm feeling really groggy today.
229658	233339	It's like I can't kick this grog thing I've got going on.
233679	235999	So I've just decided during tonight's show, you know what?
236640	237060	Fuck it.
237460	238080	I said, Alan.
239111	240852	Alan, do we have any wine?
241192	242733	He's like, yes, we have like four bottles.
242813	243293	What do you want?
243334	244474	I'm like, I don't care.
245175	245955	I want wine.
246595	249077	I don't know what it is, but serve it to me in a Coke bottle.
249237	250017	Exactly.
250538	260663	So the wonderful Alan is over there right now cracking open a bottle of wine for me so I can have a little bit of a celebratory drink because it was a really kick-ass weekend.
260704	261364	I will say that.
261704	262725	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
281241	284322	and so it actually kind of made me go like, wow, why don't I do this more often?
284402	290545	And I'm like, oh yeah, I have a three hour radio show every week where I get to kind of practice the speaking skills a little bit.
290665	291866	So there you go.
292766	293886	Oh, Alan, you rule.
293946	294727	Thank you so much.
294827	295667	You want to say hi to listeners?
296528	297028	Hi, listeners.
297808	298208	Thank you.
299689	302030	This first sip of wine's for all you guys.
304776	305836	Is it sweet and fruity?
305996	308037	It is extremely sweet and extremely fruity.
308057	308497	You want a sip?
308797	308977	Sure.
309237	309477	Okay.
310198	310478	All right.
312658	313058	Let's see.
313318	314839	I was going to... Oh, yes.
314899	317200	Entire... What?
317300	318240	That's actually really good.
318280	319020	It tastes like candy.
319240	319680	Isn't it?
319700	320861	It actually tastes like sweet tarts.
321361	321821	It's great.
321861	322201	Doesn't it?
322741	323741	It's from a local winery.
323761	325482	We actually drive out there to the winery.
325502	326542	It's only about a 30-minute drive.
326562	327562	Next time you go, grab me a bottle.
328303	329263	I mean, seriously, I'll pay you for it.
330865	333868	Tiger Claw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com His legs are smooth.
348202	351685	I'm beardless for the first time in a couple years, I think, at this point.
352225	355347	So, I mean, I used to, like, for most of my 20s, I didn't have a beard.
355368	356869	The last time you did it was for Rocky, wasn't it?
356969	357689	Or for Repo.
358170	359511	Yeah, Rocky or Repo, one of those.
360211	364555	But again, last night, Colonel Mustard, who I was playing in the movie, only has a mustache.
364815	371540	So I took it down to my porn stash yesterday, which the minute I walk out of the bathroom, Alan goes, Oh, Freddie Mercury, I love your work.
371701	372701	And I'm like, fuck off.
373742	378365	So, I shaved off the mustache last night, so now I'm clean shaven again.
378506	379406	Did the show must go on?
380107	380367	Yes.
382568	384190	I want to break free.
384950	385170	Anyway.
385591	387412	Was your makeup flaking, but still?
389653	412527	But anyway, so I'm trying to grow back at least some scruff for GamerX Because I'm going from one busy weekend to another GamerX is next weekend in San Francisco We will not be here live because of it I'm sorry, sorry about it But I won't be back on Sunday night for the show So unfortunately, Studio OLR will be closed on Sunday So Loki, you get a week off to do whatever And DarkSakura, you can come feed Sanrio
413368	413988	You know what?
414329	421216	Gamer X would probably just be like the ultimate dream of any convention because I don't know.
421716	423038	It just would be fun.
423678	424919	You love gay men and women.
426161	427282	You love video games.
427782	430085	I'm expecting that there will also be more bathed people.
430618	432359	Yes, I'm hoping for that too.
432979	435319	So, it's going to be a good time.
435559	439561	Fabulous people, fabulous games, and no con funk.
439881	441201	You know what they need to do.
441441	443302	And this goes for pretty much any con.
443442	445382	And I know it might annoy some people and stuff.
445402	448703	But they need to have... What was it?
450404	452404	Oh, what the fuck is that place now?
452484	453945	The place with all the stinky fucking shit.
457023	486072	I keep wanting to say Bed Bath & Beyond but it's not Bed Bath & Beyond it's uh Perfumania god damn I don't remember the place now Bath & Body Works there you go they need to have a booth there because their stores fucking reek but they reek of like flowery stuff not con funk so you get them you put them in the middle of the con and then it just kind of averages itself out I was there at the AX that people were passing out um hygiene bags it was the last AX I went to by the way
486992	488994	Anyhow, this is important to say.
489154	491256	GamerX is not just for gay people.
491476	492877	It's for everybody.
493057	496940	It's an all-inclusive event.
497020	497941	It's for everybody.
498061	499382	And I think it's going to be a good time.
500143	504606	I am co-hosting, co-being on a panel on Saturday.
504747	505107	I think it's 6.
505627	506088	It's 5 or 6.
506308	508189	I can't even remember at this point because I'm so exhausted.
508209	508690	You're co-paneling.
509150	519475	I'm co-paneling Podcast Cross Zone with two guys from Game Buoy, two guys from Koopa Club, and one guy from Game Bar.
519595	522097	And we're going to just be talking about podcasting, and it'll be great.
522597	527719	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I wonder, is there going to be any live stream happening at GamerX?
528720	529981	Probably, but not by us.
530641	532382	We have no plans to do any live streaming.
533242	533762	and DarkSakura.
555808	579408	and you know whatever else comes from stay tuned on Twitter you can follow me on Twitter twitter.com slash SKIE Sky and I'll be posting lots of tweets from the weekend so I'm looking forward to it and hopefully no time on all PMs next weekend so it'll be good oh all right I don't know what else to talk about here at the top of the show does anybody else have a kickoff topic according to Loki I'm crocheting a rainbow penis cozy
580628	586652	She showed me something that looked like, you know, a little, almost like a mitt for a finger or something like that.
586672	587173	I'm like, oh.
587793	588654	Middle finger cozy.
588754	589714	There's a picture on my Tumblr.
589734	590495	Oh, there you are.
590535	590815	All right.
590895	592256	Where's your Tumblr again, for those who don't know?
592276	593297	Kuro Tsubasa.
593437	595778	K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.
596619	596919	All right.
597499	599401	What's recognized by FemShep?
599841	600882	No, that's mass affecting.
601362	601462	Oh.
602323	602643	Eh, whatever.
602663	603443	It's all fine.
603804	605665	Hey, my blogs are cool.
606311	607212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
636207	646873	No, but I'm going to be going back to, I'm going to be changing my live stream night once I'm out of training because I will be working on Thursdays.
648073	651535	So my streaming will probably be earlier in the day.
652456	658299	Probably, I have to find, make sure it's pre some show or something like that, but.
659432	662733	Speaking of live streaming, Bobby wanted me to throw a plug out here and this will be fun.
662993	667674	He will be live streaming Saints Row 4 on August 14th is the day he's going to do that.
667794	671155	That'll be exciting.
671475	676677	I'm probably going to finish my Mass Effect 3 stream just because I've beaten that game 27,000 times.
677677	679598	Actually, no, I think I'm on my 20th playthrough.
679678	680558	So, anyway.
681318	687761	Um, so yeah, I will be finishing up that, that if I can keep it from lagging from the high res graphics that I plugged in, I don't know why it's doing it.
687901	690202	My computer is more than capable of handling it.
690342	698565	So, um, and then, um, I'll be, I'll be announcing that when that starts back up on mass affecting.tumblr.com plug, plug.
699325	703207	And, um, in the interim, I am actually making stuff for video games.
704230	731035	I am going to be making little slip pockets for 3DS I will be making them in XL size and as soon as I have everything set up I will be doing I think my first batch is going to be in Tetris fabric so anyone's interested talk to me fun yeah but yeah Animal Crossing and pinball what kind of pinball what games the stuff in my house you need some pinball games for your 3DS
732660	748738	I need some other games for my 3DS well we borrowed Fire Emblem from George but Dan wanted to play the previous Fire Emblem first so he went and bought that there is another game going on in my house and that is Phantasy Star Generation 1 the Sega Ages one
751161	766680	So basically I've been replacing all of the music in Animal Crossing for the updated Phantasy Star So everything sounds like combat from Phantasy Star in Animal Crossing It's been very, very weird
767932	768272	All right.
769514	770275	Let's move on then.
770355	771396	Loki, how was your gaming week?
771997	773178	Didn't play a whole ton this week.
773278	775881	Just a little bit of Borderlands 2.
775921	778064	It was a few hours.
778104	779445	I got all my cards in one sitting.
780947	782029	So I played...
783476	796281	Up through level 9, and I'm at, I just got the Sanctuary, so that's, you know, my, like, fourth time playing through this game, I swear, because I played through it on console.
796501	801203	I played through it on the Xbox, like, three times, so it's like, ooh, I've already done this before.
801643	803944	But, so, yeah, I'll do that, and...
805310	806592	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
819428	820629	I do it all the time.
822970	823291	What else?
823771	826713	I think I did play Super Meat Boy a little bit this week as well.
828995	829595	I think that's it though.
830036	835500	I have Shadowrun Returns because they finally sent me the code from kickstarting that.
836741	838722	I did get to download that.
838743	839663	I haven't played it yet.
840444	841084	Although it looks fun.
843366	852472	Video Game High School Season 2 Episode 1 came out this week and it was fantastic and long because now they're all 30 minute long episodes instead of like 5 minute episodes.
852692	857195	It was like between 6 and 15 minute episodes last season.
857996	859397	It looks interesting.
859677	860778	It's cool.
861018	866401	I didn't get a chance to download their high frame rate version yet but the trailer was kind of neat.
866441	871385	How they have 48 frames per second for the video game stuff and then 24 for everything else.
872385	875648	Um, but it's entertaining and they've had a lot of cameos in there.
875768	882053	There's already been a Stan Lee cameo and, um, a Cliffy B cameo already in there.
882253	883774	So that's it.
883894	885195	Oh, so that's what that guy's been up to.
885215	885756	Yeah.
885796	889579	He, he was like, he was a judge for some, something, you know?
890039	890379	All right.
890820	891981	But, uh, it was, it was cool.
892521	893542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
914392	918354	and then I played it again later in the week and it's a lot of fun.
918414	924837	It's kind of like one of those like Metroidvania type of games but the castle each time you play is randomly generated.
925357	939424	And when I say each time you play I mean each time you die and you come back as somebody else because that's the whole trick in Rogue Legacy is that you revive as the descendant of the last hero that you played as who will have some very different and unique traits.
939864	967855	Such as they might be more of a paladin who, you know, has a shield Or they might be somebody who's a giant Or they might be somebody who has Tourette's So they just randomly have a little Q-Bert swear cloud that comes up Or somebody who has, they start to do some interesting and a little bit controversial ones They have one with dyslexia where all the letters when people talk will get switched around Like randomly And the vertigo one was a pain in the ass That's where the entire thing is flipped
968875	986884	so like you're walking on the ceiling and all that oh my gosh that thing ticked me off uh but yeah that you a lot of fun because you collect as much gold as you can when you go to the castle and you can buy power-ups that all the future people will get to use but in order to go back in the castle you have to give up all your gold on hand
987444	1009266	so it really is about get as much gold as you can make the next hero a little stronger so he can get further he or she make get as much as you can make the next hero stronger and so on and so on and each time it's random although at one point you can hire somebody like I think it's an architect they call it and the architect will allow you to keep the same castle as the last generation but you'll only get 40% of the gold
1011890	1016598	It's really a brilliant little trick in the game.
1016899	1017981	I really liked it a lot.
1018802	1022028	I was going to say, you'd be a lot better at the vertigo levels if you played more Strider.
1023504	1026286	Or if I turned my monitor upside down when those came up.
1026406	1029369	Or played a lot more VVVVV.
1029549	1030029	Yeah, right.
1030129	1033812	Or just don't pick those guys moving forward, which is my plan.
1034453	1039596	Because you get to pick from which one of three descendants do you want to play as.
1040137	1044901	I did the Vertigo one for the LOL on the feed when I was broadcasting, but no more of those.
1044981	1047583	It's kind of one of those you do it once for the laughs and then that's it.
1048143	1049725	So, that was Rogue Legacy.
1050806	1056153	Bobby and I finally had our much advertised and talked about Borderlands Noob Night on Tuesday.
1056173	1057034	Yeah, I missed that.
1057114	1058616	Like, I didn't read my tweets and I...
1059473	1061995	Yeah, we tagged you in it just to see if you were going to drop in.
1062275	1067879	And we actually played from the start of the game to about level 7-ish.
1068300	1071062	So I think we were in like chapter 3 or something by the time we stopped.
1071122	1073544	I mean, you know, we played a pretty good chunk of the game.
1073824	1078527	So did you finish Captain Flint or did you... Yes, I think that was the last guy we killed.
1078547	1080929	And then we got on a boat and we were taken somewhere else.
1081209	1082790	Okay, so you're in chapter 4 then.
1083271	1083871	Oh, was it really?
1083931	1085052	Wow.
1085332	1086393	The first few chapters are fast.
1086693	1088034	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1107173	1108033	But it was fun.
1108214	1112396	I mean, we had a good time, and I think we entertained the folks that were watching us broadcasting on Twitch.
1112936	1116898	But, you know, I'm really bad at first-person shooters.
1117038	1125222	But the cool thing about Borderlands 2 is that, like, the character I was playing had a little, like... Once you got to level 5, you got a little gun turret that you can place on the ground.
1125262	1126483	It'll automatically shoot people.
1126863	1127503	So that was cool.
1127903	1131065	And Bobby was playing the Mechromancer, who is the...
1131425	1132105	Thanks for watching!
1153558	1180373	now when Borderlands 2 was on sale on Steam I was gifted a copy of Borderlands 2 by a great listener and I picked up the season pass myself because I'm like alright well I know I'm going to want to do all the DLC and all the other stuff that's out right now so I'm just going to pick up the season pass and that way I'll have it when I want to play well when I go in to play the game again the second time later in the week I went back in the game I'm like I'm going to try this again but this time I'm going to do the Mechomancer she's locked
1181013	1184275	and I'm like, wait a minute, I should have this because I bought the season pass.
1184735	1188958	And I do some research and I'm like, wait a minute, the season pass is showing on my account, what's going on?
1189478	1192640	The characters aren't included in the season pass.
1192900	1193941	She was a pre-order bonus.
1195602	1198084	See, and that's the line I've been getting from a lot of people.
1198424	1201206	Yes, okay, she was a pre-order bonus, but they're still selling her.
1202270	1203031	Here's the thing.
1204172	1208275	Not everybody's going to agree with me, and that's fine, but we all get opinions, so take it or leave it.
1208916	1215281	I kind of think when they're selling this as a season pass and they're leaving parts out, that's a little bit disingenuous to me.
1215822	1220166	And you may argue with me on that, and that's fine, but to me, it's like picking up, like...
1221046	1228209	When you get a season pass, like when I pick up Lost Season 7 on DVD, Episode 4 is suddenly missing.
1228669	1231050	Oh, well, Episode 4 was a pre-order bonus only.
1232091	1235032	It's not how it works, yo.
1235692	1240555	So I think it's more appropriately titled as a bundle.
1240795	1241595	That's what you're selling.
1241615	1243036	You're selling a DLC bundle.
1243056	1244816	Well, yeah.
1244836	1247938	We haven't gotten into it yet, but for Saints Row 4, it's like...
1248658	1249639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1265089	1270371	Right, but they didn't market it as something that like, you know, season pass I think implies a particular thing.
1270411	1272612	And maybe this is just a terminology thing in our industry.
1272993	1278295	And we've been here before with the whole download content that's actually on a disc.
1278655	1281857	And I think we were all sitting here on the show saying that is not DLC.
1281937	1283757	That is pay to unlock content.
1284058	1284798	That is what it is.
1285058	1289280	And what I'm saying is that the Borderlands 2 season pass is not a season pass.
1289700	1291001	It is a DLC bundle.
1291281	1292061	That is what it is.
1292381	1293782	You can disagree with me if you want.
1294062	1300787	that's fine, that's my opinion it's not a season pass, it's missing some episodes sensible so, anyhow
1302592	1306134	Overall, that doesn't reflect on my opinion of the game.
1306634	1308255	I still think it's a fine game.
1308655	1313977	And I think even if you don't like first person shooters, I think it's just got a really, you know, it's got a neat story.
1314277	1318199	And it's got some cool mechanics that are reminiscent of like an MMO and so forth.
1318239	1319440	It's very Diablo-esque.
1319680	1321621	And co-op mode is a lot of fun.
1321841	1322601	I will say that.
1322721	1326543	But, you know, that was just my one little thing that did irk me a little bit.
1326563	1329044	Did you find yourself comparing guns a lot?
1329184	1331105	You know, like going, ooh, ooh.
1331485	1332785	Do you have the passive-aggressive gun?
1334206	1335086	No, not yet, I don't think.
1335106	1337947	You know, if you had been a better shot, you wouldn't have been wasting bullets.
1337967	1338888	Those cost money, you know.
1339548	1344690	It was tough in co-op because what I'm used to in Diablo is that everybody gets their own loot.
1345030	1348331	That doesn't happen in Borderlands, so if Bobby picks up all the ammo, I'm stuck.
1350892	1351752	Not exactly.
1351912	1353433	It will pool ammo, I think.
1353473	1353933	Oh, will it?
1354053	1355033	I knew it pooled money.
1355473	1356574	Yeah, it will pool ammo.
1358394	1359094	Oh, okay, my bad.
1359174	1360655	Here's the question I have to ask about this.
1361815	1362796	I've got Borderlands 2 now.
1362856	1364996	I actually have the first one because I got it for free back in the day.
1365796	1368577	Do I have any benefit to finishing the first one before starting the second?
1369077	1371618	No benefit from finishing... Well, a story, I guess.
1371638	1380801	You get to learn a little bit more of the backstory of different characters because they do end up in the game as NPCs, so you know who this person is when you go and see them.
1381501	1386345	Aside from that, the only other bonus you get is you get some unlockable skins when you play the first game.
1386405	1391849	But you have to have a save file from the first game, so just play for five minutes to get a save file going and then play Borderlands 2.
1392009	1395572	Because, I mean, I watched Dan play the first one, you know, and I got so motion sick.
1396292	1401156	But I'm planning on playing through Borderlands 2 and calling it a barfest when I stream it.
1402157	1402397	Good times.
1402417	1403298	Because I'm planning on streaming it.
1403458	1406060	They have a third-person mode that you can unlock via hack.
1407165	1408871	and DarkSakura.com.
1415751	1428038	So I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster says, it would have been nice if the season pass weren't limited to only for the four DLC campaigns, but would allow you to pick which four DLC you would want for the entire season.
1428419	1429199	I kind of like that.
1429319	1434542	I mean, again, I don't think season pass is the name for that, but I really like the idea of pick them and choose them.
1435903	1436503	And here's the thing.
1436884	1442807	I would have bought the Mechamancer separately in addition to the season pass if I'd known.
1443307	1449513	and I will take some accountability for not reading thoroughly as I should have but it's just kind of like a certain thing is sort of implied by that.
1449533	1453937	No, I was with you because I was like looking at the Mechamencer thing and I saw that it was separate too.
1454258	1455519	It wasn't actually that that I noticed.
1455599	1458642	It was I was going through some skins because I
1459402	1460804	I modded it to unlock all the skins.
1461284	1462586	And so I was going through the skins.
1462626	1463867	I'm like, oh, I want to wear that one.
1464107	1465949	And it popped me to the Steam store.
1465969	1470094	I'm like, why does it show me stuff that's in there that I don't have?
1470654	1471595	Oh, you want me to buy it?
1471975	1472696	No, I'm not going to buy it.
1472776	1474118	Dangling the carrot in front of you.
1474598	1476100	But again, all that other...
1476460	1477900	That's what STO does, by the way.
1478100	1478881	All that other junk.
1478901	1481901	Well, STO's a free-to-play game, too, so you cut at some different concessions.
1481921	1489523	But for paid outfits, it gives you the option of setting up that outfit, and then when you load the outfit on your character when you're making them, it says, this is pay XX amount.
1489743	1490363	Ah, gotcha.
1490983	1503626	Well, speaking of free-to-play, the other game I've been playing this week, and I really can't explain how this happened, but I've sunk in about five, six hours in Dota 2, Defense of the Ancients 2, which is a free game.
1503686	1505346	I know, there's probably some people out there going, what?
1505826	1508068	League of Legends League of Legends League of Legends
1522322	1527743	have influence from the original mod called Defense of the Ancients that was in Warcraft 3.
1527803	1534265	It was an insanely popular mod to the game, just like Team Fortress was a popular mod to Quake, and so on.
1534485	1536266	Sometimes mods become their own little thing.
1536826	1540107	So Defense of the Ancients became its own game, essentially.
1540187	1545508	So Valve has the Dota 2, there's League of Legends, and there's all these other games that are inspired by it, too.
1545788	1547248	Blizzard's going to have their own thing.
1548429	1549769	All-Stars, I think is what it's called.
1550369	1551170	Heroes of Newerth
1576808	1577708	Here's the thing with Dota 2.
1578509	1594283	So I think what happened is I was looking around the community marketplace, I was looking at the trading cards, the value of cards, and I was looking at some of the stuff that was in Dota 2, like that was up there on the marketplace, and I decided to just launch the game because I wanted to see, because apparently I had some stuff from Dota 2 for just being in the beta.
1594644	1596986	So I just wanted to launch the game and see what it was all about.
1597406	1601330	And I noticed right away when I launched the game, the launcher looked different than it did before.
1601950	1603671	I was like, oh, this is laid out all differently.
1603771	1606212	And it threw me right into this tutorial mode.
1606512	1608152	Do you want to learn how to start playing the game?
1608272	1609413	So I said, all right, whatever.
1609533	1610113	I'm going to sit here.
1610873	1613414	I didn't get it when I played League of Legends, but maybe I'll get it this time.
1613814	1614955	So I started to play.
1615335	1616255	I played the first tutorial.
1616575	1617496	I played the second tutorial.
1617956	1618676	And I kept playing.
1619356	1620677	And here I was.
1620897	1622758	I was actually learning how to play Dota 2.
1623038	1629140	And all these things that I'm sure if you're a League of Legends player sitting out there listening, you're probably going, duh, Rob.
1629480	1630461	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1658036	1664039	And then it takes you from that to, okay, now you're going to play a map and all you're going to do, you're going to take out one tower.
1664719	1667981	And then it says, okay, now this time you're going to do a middle lane fight.
1668021	1671442	The only lane that's available is the middle lane and it's a 1v1 map.
1671782	1674423	And you just kind of learn and learn and learn that way.
1674904	1682467	And right now I'm on the part of it where I'm playing an entire match against bots, but with limited heroes selection.
1682647	1685108	So I'm like, I've been learning how to play the game and it's fun.
1685208	1686609	But it's still an RTS, right?
1686629	1686709	Yeah.
1687029	1688531	It's what they call a MOBA.
1689291	1690873	It's kind of a new genre of game.
1690913	1693475	It's a multiplayer online battle arena.
1695577	1696758	It's different.
1696898	1698840	I can't really say it's like an RTS.
1699040	1701102	Because RTS games just make me hurt.
1701362	1706407	Well, imagine an RTS mixed with World of Warcraft.
1706527	1709450	That's really a crude way of putting it, but it's the best I can do.
1710806	1712007	I still don't know that I would like it.
1712407	1714227	I've been thinking about it and I've seen people play it.
1714887	1716568	But I hate real-time strategies.
1716608	1717848	And it's not because I'm not good at them.
1717928	1718668	I'm really good at them.
1718768	1721009	I just think that they're very boring.
1721309	1723670	Well, I would honestly recommend Dota 2.
1723890	1729251	Just get in there and play the tutorial mode because you don't really play against other people until towards the end of it if you want.
1729691	1751432	and the nice thing about Dota 2 is if you want to play an all bot match you can but here's the interesting thing now that I've done this now I want to go back and play League of Legends again because I feel like okay now I get it and everybody tells me League of Legends is kind of easier to wrap your head around than Dota because I guess there is still a lot of stuff beyond the tutorials and Dota that I haven't really experienced yet but I want to go back and play League of Legends and you know you can do bot matches there and everything's
1751972	1755474	So, the only negatives I ever hear about these games is the community.
1755954	1757935	That the communities in these games are really awful.
1758335	1762457	But, you know, the makers of the games, to their credits, are taking strides to try and combat that.
1762717	1769560	There's a big old blog post on the Dota 2 forums and League of Legends, I know, has their whole community tribal councils.
1769600	1771881	I think we were calling it on Horde House and so forth.
1771921	1772982	So, you know, they're trying.
1773422	1778984	But, yeah, so this week I want to go back and play League of Legends and see if I get it this time.
1779785	1779925	So...
1781144	1782504	I'll give it a... Okay, how about this?
1782624	1789606	How about at some point this week, if I'm not completely fried with my new job, I will give it a try.
1789926	1790086	Yeah.
1790306	1792347	And I will report on it by the next show.
1792627	1793007	Sounds good.
1793307	1793587	Okay.
1793867	1794127	All right.
1794167	1801549	Techness in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, if you really get into Dota 2 League of Legends, you would actually find that they do play differently.
1801829	1803150	Yeah, I don't doubt that, Technus.
1803991	1805833	I read some of the comparison articles online.
1805853	1813140	I've heard a lot about the timing and things that they do play differently in that regard and just the way they're laid out and so forth.
1815869	1816209	We'll see.
1816810	1821814	Technus says, I felt that League of Legends had a better hand-holding tutorial, but I haven't touched Dota 2 past beta.
1822294	1824636	I think that tutorial went in when it launched.
1825296	1826097	So that's the thing.
1827178	1832041	And yeah, Kasson in our chatroom, I hope I said that right, says, Dota has tutorials now?
1832261	1832862	Yes, it does.
1833582	1835464	So if you're curious about it, why not?
1835504	1835924	Check it out.
1838406	1840447	Yeah, I guess that was really my gaming week in a nutshell.
1840668	1842228	So some quick housekeeping.
1842288	1850753	Don't forget to visit our website at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR and Facebook, Facebook.com slash OrangeLaunchRadio.
1850854	1851614	I apologize.
1851634	1860039	There was no Fugle Question of the Week this week, so we won't be able to do that segment in Part B. That is my bad and just the insanity crazy weekend I had.
1860139	1863101	I literally threw this show together about an hour before we went live tonight.
1863981	1865682	So yeah, we cut some quarters.
1865702	1866643	I just thought of a question.
1867103	1867403	Did you?
1867644	1867984	Yeah.
1868264	1870567	Well, we can ask it in two weeks when we come back.
1870907	1872488	Well, it won't be relevant then, but it's okay.
1872568	1872849	Don't.
1872989	1874470	What were you going to ask?
1874530	1875431	I'll bring it up with my story.
1875491	1875892	How about that?
1876112	1876512	Okay, there you go.
1876552	1877673	I was going to say ask the chatters.
1878094	1879575	You can get some immediate feedback there.
1879836	1882298	Yeah, I'll ask the chatters and then we'll, yeah.
1882523	1883103	Alright, there you go.
1883163	1884004	Maybe some emails.
1884164	1887627	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Alright, let's get into the news tonight.
1887667	1887927	Loki.
1888407	1904558	Alright, as the next continuing chapter of the 180 saga, Microsoft has now confirmed that despite what they said earlier, they made a small error and yes, there will actually be self-publishing now for the Xbox One.
1905499	1905679	And...
1906980	1907421	DarkSakura, Loki,
1926724	1928105	Thanks for watching!
1945592	1946493	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1962145	1967207	We don't know all the details yet of what the self-publishing is going to require.
1967867	1968448	What you can do.
1968808	1974010	It sounds cool that we can use any of the retail consoles as a dev unit.
1974630	1975391	I mean, that's kind of cool.
1976051	1982173	But we don't know yet what the requirements are going to be as far as submitting something in there.
1982193	1983934	Are you going to have to go through a review process?
1983974	1985575	Is it going to be like XNA was?
1986836	1989538	Do you mean by cover ground, cover their ass?
2009314	2011936	Uh, yeah, to help make up ground for that they lost.
2012536	2027129	Um, and then also there's a rumor that this might not just pertain to the Xbox One, that, uh, apparently the, um, developer Farsight Studios, um, who's, you know, done some work on the Pinball Arcade, uh,
2027549	2028510	Thanks for watching!
2046864	2051607	So, it sounds like that this may also apply to the Xbox 360 as well.
2051647	2058192	Yeah, technically you have to file that in the rumor bin, but when it's coming out like this, it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, oh, they probably got told something.
2058252	2062194	Because that game was a pretty big deal, and it sucks that it disappeared.
2062514	2064376	So, it's no wonder.
2064416	2066597	I bet Microsoft themselves kind of wants to get that game back.
2066617	2075243	So, this is interesting with how they're going to do this, but at the same time, I mean, I don't know, this is almost like...
2076590	2081412	Well, now that this isn't really exclusive to the Xbox One, you're kind of competing with yourself again.
2081892	2084513	It's just like all these great games are coming out on the Xbox 360.
2085254	2089095	Why do I need to spend $500 to get an Xbox One that has pretty much the same games?
2089836	2090636	They look slightly better.
2092347	2092667	I don't know.
2113881	2138411	they have a 4 gig system with Kinect a 250 gig system they got rid of the 250 gig system with Kinect because that was competing with the Xbox One they figured that the people that are going to be buying that are going to be buying the Xbox One so then you have the Xbox One and then whatever holiday bundle it is that's their strategy going in and I think that's going to be going forward is how they're going to do it they're going to have 4 or 5 SKUs depending on whether there's a holiday bundle available or a bundle of some sort
2139631	2143752	SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, just seems very vague.
2143892	2145753	I expect this won't be ready day one.
2146493	2150213	I think a lot of this they're just trying to save because they're talking at Gamescom.
2150233	2153014	They don't want to just like, yeah, you guys already heard all this information.
2153054	2154134	Let's just repeat it again.
2154374	2157915	But I think it's kind of lame that they're doing that.
2157935	2160316	I mean, because, you know, people want to know.
2160416	2165337	Developers want to know what the details are so they can consider making their games for your platform.
2165377	2166137	And yet you're just like,
2166877	2170061	AkumaJP in our chatroom says, Sounds like Microsoft is suffering from multiple personality disorder.
2187060	2194626	Well, to be fair, they did take a beating at E3, and they went through a major management change just in the past month.
2194726	2199290	So the fact that some of these things are starting to come out isn't that surprising.
2199350	2201352	It's just like, how fast can it really happen?
2202136	2203097	I think it's all good news.
2203577	2205759	Yeah, it's good news at the end of the day.
2205879	2216588	Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it's going to work as far as like, are we going to see the Xbox Live Arcade marketplace turn into kind of like what Xbox Indie Games is?
2216928	2222833	I hope not, because that's going to be really difficult to find stuff with everybody publishing titles.
2223413	2226476	Especially since one of the big words they used was deliverability.
2227116	2230159	I mean, they have to make it easy to access to make it deliverable.
2231403	2234065	I think a lot of it too is it would really help them out.
2234426	2239851	I would think it's going to look more like iTunes because iTunes is the self-publishing central.
2240332	2241493	I'll tell you what this really is.
2241894	2245858	It's not about publishing on the Xbox One stuff, although that's good and everything.
2246398	2247179	What it is is it's...
2248240	2255603	The way they have it, the way you develop games, it's not even really the Xbox marketplace or whatever.
2255783	2259785	It's the Windows Store is basically what it is.
2259965	2269389	When you publish a game, it's available for Windows 8, Windows Phone, and now the Microsoft Xbox One.
2269769	2272250	That's what it's going to be, is publishing on all three platforms.
2272450	2274711	They're trying to get to a point where...
2275171	2278114	You buy Angry Birds on Windows 8.
2279294	2282237	Now you have Angry Birds on your Xbox One and on your Windows phone.
2282477	2284459	I think that's exactly where my mind's going.
2284499	2287481	That is key because that's how iTunes works if you think about it.
2287541	2292205	You can buy from your mobile device or your iPad or you can buy on your desktop.
2292285	2295968	And then through the cloud, it all shows up on all your devices automatically.
2295988	2298750	And I really think that's how the game systems ought to work.
2298810	2299651	Sony included.
2299931	2302053	Nintendo too if they could ever get there.
2302193	2319595	unless you buy the better version for your iPad that takes advantage of the iPad's resolution but from what I heard from them they're a long way away from that like they may be promising something like that right now but 2015 at the earliest this is going to happen wow so it's a long way off wow
2319935	2325439	We had discussions with the Microsoft reps about this kind of stuff because that was my thought and they were like, yeah, you're right.
2328381	2329382	It's interesting.
2329482	2335346	And I'm kind of hesitant at the same time as like, okay, you can develop games for Xbox One.
2335926	2350651	Are they really going to be Xbox One games, or are they going to be these Windows games running on that Windows OS portion of the Xbox 360 that just happened to be part of the Xbox One?
2350711	2355833	It's not actually a true native Xbox One game, you know what I mean?
2358012	2358372	All right.
2358452	2365154	Well, it's going to be interesting to see what develops and also kind of how the Microsoft Sony dance continues with this.
2365534	2376118	So, I mean, obviously Microsoft's doing this in some way to catch up to Sony and their reaction they got at E3, but it'll be interesting to see what Sony might do to kind of one-up that.
2377031	2386397	But anyway, let's talk about a big budget game and a game that a lot of folks are excited about over on Nintendo's platform, Smash Bros., Super Smash Bros.
2386838	2396244	Now, a new story came out this week that Masahiro Sakurai said that in the story mode, there will not be a subspace emissary storyline that was in Brawl.
2396864	2398966	There will be a single-player campaign, however.
2399286	2406831	But in Famitsu Magazine, he actually said that the story mode won't happen because cutscenes get uploaded on the internet.
2407512	2427270	really weird excuse but here's the quote for us to ponder quote unfortunately the movie scenes we worked hard to create were uploaded onto the internet you can only truly wow a player the first time he sees a cutscene I felt if players saw the cutscenes outside of the game they would no longer service rewards for playing the game so I've decided against having them
2428271	2430112	That's a very strange quote.
2430292	2432033	Let's chew on that for a minute.
2432133	2434954	That's a quote from somebody who doesn't understand how the internet works.
2435014	2435274	Right.
2436094	2442437	You know, it's basically... I understand his point of view where, you know, woo, that's a really cool video and stuff, but...
2443724	2451528	That's like saying, if you see a movie trailer, you're not going to want to see the movie because you saw scenes from the movie in the movie trailer.
2452528	2458130	Yeah, but with all the Let's Play and all of that, you can see a heck of a lot more than a trailer of a game that's out there.
2458270	2464413	I understand that, but not... And Nintendo's also taken a stance against Let's Play in the past, even though they might have went back on it.
2464433	2472957	But people that are watching Let's Play videos aren't necessarily going to be the people that are going to be spoiled by, Oh, I can't play this game anymore because I watched it being played through already.
2473417	2474359	It's not gonna be like that.
2474419	2478005	If anything, it's gonna get people excited because they see these awesome cutscenes.
2478186	2480870	They're like, whoa, I wanna see more of this game.
2481840	2488545	But just instead of making excuses about YouTube and saying that's why you did it, just be honest.
2488785	2490206	We want to get this game out right away.
2490246	2498271	This is a feature that not a lot of people utilize, so we're going to focus on the multiplayer and make that the best part of the game because that's what people want to play when they play Smash.
2498451	2503075	Just come out and say that instead of being a dick about it and saying, hey...
2503675	2508158	Yeah, it's because those people upload our videos on YouTube.
2508358	2509999	Come on, it's just ridiculous.
2510180	2511240	I'm with you there a little bit.
2511661	2512681	I'm really with you there a little bit.
2512701	2516584	This does seem like a convenient excuse to get the game moving right along, which is fine.
2516884	2518205	But yeah, exactly the way you said it.
2518245	2521347	I think if he came out and said it that way, a lot of people would be like, yay!
2521788	2523349	Yeah, if something we tried...
2523669	2528193	Brawl, some people liked it, not a lot of people really played it.
2528433	2538642	So instead of splitting our team down the middle and focusing it all on half on the single player and half on the multiplayer, we're just going to focus on the multiplayer.
2539062	2540964	Hell, that's what they did for Titanfall.
2541464	2547910	And I still don't buy that excuse, by the way, for Titanfall either, because honestly, I do care about a single player campaign for Titanfall.
2551613	2568065	I hope that the game really kicks butt, but if the fighting element of the game is really, really good, then I think people will forget about this in six months.
2568425	2570847	But there could have been a better way to deliver this news.
2572308	2572548	All right.
2573295	2577218	Speaking of other bad news, or don't care about this news, who knows.
2577879	2581521	Because I've heard from people that there's various minds going on about this.
2582102	2587266	But Polytron put out an announcement that Fez 2 was cancelled, and Phil Fish says, yep, I'm done.
2588206	2594391	And this is going after some internet dramas of various...
2596953	2597554	Bitch Levels.
2597955	2599097	I'm just gonna go out and say it.
2599157	2602923	It's people being bitchy on the internet and people out bitching the other and out trolling the other.
2603524	2604265	And actually...
2605382	2606223	Listen to Bobby's show.
2607564	2609785	He went off on it in a way that I 100% agree with.
2611387	2612167	It was ridiculous.
2613628	2614649	It's not a big surprise.
2614669	2622315	It's something that he would do because one of the things he was arguing about with the Annoyed Gamer thing was, what kind of art have you put out?
2623256	2625717	It's almost like your stupid show or whatever is nothing.
2626058	2628119	I've created art with Fez.
2628560	2630281	It's like, dude, you've put out one indie game.
2632165	2633667	You're not fucking God, okay?
2633767	2635129	It's just, it's a game.
2635429	2636230	Yeah, it was great.
2636410	2637111	People liked it.
2637392	2637692	Cool.
2638413	2640716	But you're not like, just get off your high horse.
2640776	2642979	It's one damn game, man.
2643599	2644060	One game.
2645462	2647144	This to me looks like an internet meltdown.
2648195	2649056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2663734	2685971	It's a movie, and reality shows distort people all the time, you always take that stuff with a grain of salt But this really just seems like a big pomp and circumstance about something that doesn't, this whole thing is like a waste of time And in the end Oh sorry, my favorite comparison I heard out there on the internet was that Phil Fish is the Amanda Bynes of gaming Okay
2687854	2712854	My whole thing with it is that if you find yourself close to a meltdown and this is what you need to do is take a step back, go someplace safe where you have nothing to trigger you, watch some cartoons, sit back and watch some Adventure Time, open a couple beers, and play on Tumblr for a while because Tumblr is sort of safe too.
2713672	2715213	You know, it happens to the best of us.
2715613	2717754	I had a diva fit here on OLR one night.
2717814	2719615	It was an infamous moment that happened.
2719635	2721056	It was like five years ago at this point.
2721136	2722377	You scared the shit out of Shermie.
2723658	2723998	No, no, no.
2724038	2724758	That wasn't at your place.
2724778	2725619	That was at the studio.
2725659	2727180	You had one at my house.
2727320	2732783	I might have had a little one, but I had a big one when something like the wrong thing was said in the chat room.
2733183	2735445	And remember, I left and I'm like, you know what?
2735525	2736905	If you don't like... I left.
2737466	2737686	I just...
2738146	2739027	Quit mid-show.
2739347	2741248	I didn't quit the show, but I just said, you know what?
2741308	2744471	I'm going to go do something more fun than this right now because I'm not taking this right now.
2744511	2744811	No way.
2745945	2746706	I'm not making Fez 2.
2774784	2783269	But I kind of sit here and go, you're going to take what this guy who calls himself an annoyed gamer says to get under your skin?
2783790	2794296	I mean, and again, I don't know this other guy either, this annoyed gamer or whatever, but I kind of look at that name going, wow, you sound like everything that I hate about the games industry, all in two little words right there.
2794316	2795317	Besides, I am the annoyed gamer.
2795337	2797238	Why don't you just call yourself cynical fuck?
2797658	2798859	You know, I'm just kind of like...
2800233	2829237	the angry video game nerd did it better and that was parody yeah and he's actually hilarious and I think this other guy is kind of trying to be legit but it does seem weird to me again if the whole thing boils down to that you know Phil Fish did not want to comment on this you know Xbox thing that's going on he should have just said no comment or no thank you as opposed to fuck you you fucking fuck which is you know not a direct quote but the sense of what I get happened in that particular case
2829517	2830718	I paraphrasing a little bit.
2831939	2849670	You know, like I said, he needs to take a step back, go to a safe place, maybe put on some old school Duran Duran, bop out a little bit to Hungry Like the Wolf, and then maybe come back with a cooler head.
2852509	2854051	All right, and I'm checking the chat room.
2854091	2858255	ZZZ in our chat room says, Was the episode where Rob Rage quitted the show ever uploaded?
2858295	2860397	I only listened to the podcast at the time and didn't get to hear it.
2861017	2870847	I think the whole thing happened over a video card error that happened because that's why the listeners pulled together and bought this new computer that we broadcast the show from.
2871167	2872789	And that happened after the D.Va moment.
2872829	2873369	So I think...
2874270	2902348	I think the video card like went out mid show and I actually lost the show up to that point and then when we recorded again it was that comment was said and I think the show got thrown out I don't think it was ever podcast to be honest I think it was captured on because at the time we were streaming on Justin TV this is before Twitch existed I think some of it lived on there but I think it's gone long gone as too old at this point so unless we had our bootlegger you really don't need to see it
2904835	2908097	Don't try to capture one of my worst moments in radio.
2908557	2909937	That's the downside to it.
2910017	2916020	I like to think I've done about... It says it was on the feed and actually it isn't.
2916140	2916800	I don't remember.
2917781	2918981	I don't either.
2919922	2920522	You know what?
2921442	2926224	One bad moment out of 514 episodes.
2926244	2928045	Why do you want to fixate on that one bad moment?
2928065	2929686	That's all I'm saying.
2930486	2931867	Because that's what people do.
2931987	2932447	Yeah, I know.
2933147	2939771	I mean, maybe Lindsay Lohan was once a great actress, but people remember all the bad shit she's done.
2940092	2941993	What about all the good things Lindsay did?
2942133	2944675	It's just people are focusing... Like going to rehab.
2945155	2949898	People are just focusing on everything because it's just a slow news week, honestly.
2950178	2954721	Like, I couldn't believe how many people were like running, how many different outlets were running that story.
2954781	2956382	I was just like, are you kidding me?
2956422	2956983	Come on.
2957043	2958724	Didn't the whole thing that Bill...
2959284	2972876	Phil Fish blew up at... Didn't the whole thing boil down to the fact that this media guy felt like he deserved a comment on the situation, was calling out him and Jonathan Blow because they wouldn't comment on the Xbox situation?
2972896	2973516	I don't know.
2973536	2974497	Isn't that what it boiled down to?
2974657	2975057	Yeah.
2975298	2977359	I was like... They tried to provoke a reaction.
2977399	2977980	Well, they got one.
2978340	2983925	I was at a three-year-old's birthday party, and I look on the internet, because I check Twitter just every now and then.
2984605	2987508	Maybe I should make him a rainbow penis cozy.
2987608	2995154	You know what, annoyed gamer or whatever, welcome to my world, where we just get ignored.
2995735	2996896	How would you prefer that?
2998132	3001675	I know, I mean, I get ignored by all the different media outlets.
3001735	3002435	Exactly!
3002635	3005177	I'm like... Except occasionally Namco.
3005597	3007459	You should be lucky you get any comments at all.
3008139	3008459	Anyway.
3010000	3010521	Who are you?
3010721	3014463	Hey, I'm the annoyed gamer, okay?
3015904	3017526	I'm annoyed and I'm a gamer.
3017566	3023551	You are kind of the OG annoyed gamer guy.
3024171	3029175	When we talk about Saints Row 4 or Grand Theft Auto, you suddenly become the he-he-he gamer.
3029275	3032038	You're more the tickled gamer when it comes to those games.
3032578	3033759	How about the bipolar gamer?
3033799	3037322	Well, I'm a little annoyed that I'm not playing Saints Row 4 right now.
3037602	3038863	That is a little annoying, isn't it?
3040665	3041365	What does that make me?
3041405	3042286	The crafty gamer?
3045602	3046062	I don't know.
3046082	3046543	Penis cozy?
3046563	3048464	Yeah, you're the rainbow penis cozy gamer.
3049746	3050646	Maybe we should send him one.
3050666	3051507	Maybe that would make him feel better.
3052128	3052528	Perhaps.
3052568	3053369	I don't know.
3053429	3054150	Oh yeah, real quick.
3055031	3055831	It's 100% cotton.
3055871	3056172	Feel it.
3056752	3057393	That's too hot.
3057713	3058394	I can already tell.
3059535	3060075	I don't know.
3060596	3061857	Alright, let's move on with more news.
3063243	3075555	Alright, so, you know, to kind of keep along the theme of Microsoft fixing some of their hiccups in their, I don't know, game development process.
3076315	3077797	They're working World of Tanks.
3077957	3084223	The developer is basically saying, you know, they're working with Microsoft to help streamline the process of certification.
3084243	3089027	Because certification takes quite a long time with Microsoft.
3089347	3116740	and because games like free to play World of Tanks need some frequent updates to be able to push that through Microsoft it's very difficult to get one of those games to work on the Xbox 360 so right now they're working out what they need to fix on Microsoft's end to help alleviate some of that problem with the certification process
3118744	3120045	So hopefully it'll get better.
3120105	3138000	Hopefully this, by the time we get to November or whatever, I'm assuming it's November when this console is going to launch, that all this stuff will be ironed out and everything with self-publishing and all that stuff, it'll be a lot easier to get your game on there and keep it updated.
3140367	3150210	It sounds like a lot of this crap that Microsoft's had to go through is really going to make them a better company when it comes to gaming with all these things that they've had to kind of change, one of them being the certification process.
3150530	3164075	Yeah, I wonder, like, I mean, I don't know if it's just a coincidence in timing or whatever, but, you know, the departure, you know, Don Matrick there, if he was holding all this stuff back, I mean, it's like, hey, we're fixing a lot of problems, but I think it's just coincidence, you know.
3164235	3172260	You know the next thing they need to fix, and maybe this is a little bit pie-in-the-sky dreaming, but the whole, like, no cross-platform play issue.
3172880	3182005	You know, because they let it go by with Final Fantasy XI, but they won't do it with Final Fantasy XIV, and I'm sure there's a host of other games that would like to, maybe Defiance or things that would like to be cross-platform.
3182105	3187368	Honestly, I would like the ability to be able to play my game system without Kinect being attached.
3187788	3200652	Not to say that you can't have Kinect features in your game, because obviously you can still program your game with Kinect features being in there, because you know every system is going to have a Kinect.
3201072	3206873	But say I don't want to play with a Kinect on there, it just disables those features instead of not working.
3207034	3211835	And if it is a Kinect-required game, sorry, this game requires Kinect, please plug in Kinect to play this game.
3213208	3214108	Why is that so hard?
3231874	3234656	I told her she should watch that.
3234696	3235577	Does she like it?
3235657	3236277	Yeah, she likes it.
3236317	3236997	But here's the thing.
3237078	3242661	On season two, they actually had an episode where it was all of the same stuff that's going on right now.
3242921	3247424	NSA had this device to be able to spy on everybody using webcams and stuff like that.
3247984	3250085	Dude, this is like way before all this stuff happened.
3250105	3251585	That's the whole arc of the second season.
3251625	3252025	Yeah, I know.
3252085	3252665	It's funny.
3252685	3253306	It's so hilarious.
3253886	3255226	That was ironic.
3255246	3257647	Scandal's a hella good show, huh?
3257847	3264249	It's total trash, but it's like one of those shows where it's like... Sometimes you want to watch a good drama show.
3264369	3268450	That's why people watch Game of Thrones or Orange is the New Black or something, right?
3268470	3269530	I used to watch Matlock for that.
3269670	3271891	But sometimes you want to just watch crap.
3273412	3275414	I don't think it's that bad.
3275474	3280719	I mean, it's not a terrible show, but yeah, it's a little ridiculous in their plot.
3280839	3282701	I can't watch a show I have to turn off my brain for.
3282862	3288407	It's about, like, Loki, she's banging the President of the United States on the side.
3288527	3292351	Like, that's a little bit like trashy romance novel, you know?
3294193	3303542	But it's not as... Okay, coming from the fact that this show was created by the people that did Grey's Anatomy, they've toned it way down.
3303582	3306304	I mean, they've toned it way, way down.
3307886	3309848	I'll give them props for that.
3309868	3311529	That actress is so good, though.
3311649	3313431	She just commands the screen.
3313451	3314172	Kerry Washington?
3314372	3314472	Yeah.
3314492	3315633	She just commands the screen.
3315673	3316694	She's so fun to watch.
3316714	3317394	Games.
3317835	3318255	Sorry.
3319196	3322978	Well, now they want to talk TV and chat because Actdeft says Orange is the New Black is awesome.
3323238	3324419	I'm about three episodes in.
3324739	3325420	It's pretty good.
3325780	3327821	You know what I'm disappointed they got rid of?
3327841	3328442	What?
3328482	3332104	Because all these shows I'm catching on, you know, Netflix and stuff.
3332444	3334145	Better Off Ted was actually great.
3334345	3336286	I just don't understand why that show got canceled.
3336366	3337067	No, we watched it.
3337427	3337987	It's too bad.
3338027	3338688	It was great.
3339168	3340669	I just... That's sad.
3341549	3365182	Shadownextchat in our chat says everyone at OLR should check out the show Suits on USA Network the show is really well written and the cast plays off each other really well I have not seen that but the show on USA that everybody tells me I need to watch is Psych because that's the one that does all the tribute shows like they did the Twin Peaks episode and the Clue episode and they do all yeah that's the one I need to see there's only one show going to be coming out that I care about I don't even know the name of it but Seth Green's in it
3366703	3369284	I am going to bring this back to games real quick here.
3369304	3370105	Alright, probably a good idea.
3370645	3375148	I did see an advertisement today on Nickelodeon because my son was watching Spongebob.
3376009	3380232	Next Saturday, they're going to be launching the show for The Rabbids, the animated series.
3380312	3382053	So, that'll be coming next Saturday.
3382273	3383354	So, if you're interested, check out.
3383374	3385235	Did you let your son watch Spongebob?
3385455	3386916	Only at my mom's house.
3387477	3387717	Okay.
3389140	3390140	Alright, well let's move on.
3390361	3392282	Speaking of kids, let's talk Nintendo.
3394784	3396286	Ah, bad transition, bad transition.
3396506	3402431	Alright, look, I honestly file this a little more in fan wank and people dreaming of what could happen.
3402751	3409697	This is a huge leap of faith, but I will bring it up anyway since we're about discussing the news, not necessarily reporting it.
3410177	3414582	But apparently we heard about the problems that Atlas' parent company was having, right?
3414942	3424832	So there's this rumor out there that because there's going to be some subsidiary auctions going on on July 28th, Atlas is one of those subsidiaries up for sale.
3425372	3432860	And Nintendo could be a key player in that because apparently there's already some financial liability in that whole situation.
3433260	3449240	So could Nintendo end up buying Atlas, which would mean that's a development company for them that could end up meaning Persona ends up being a Wii U exclusive, Shin Megami Tensei ends up being a Wii and 3DS, Wii U exclusive and 3DS and so on.
3449680	3450241	No, no, no.
3474381	3475902	Is there a Romance of the Three Kingdoms?
3500075	3521534	Romance of the Three Kingdoms cross Pokemon game or something like that I think that's what it was and so they have that come out last year so because yeah they're working with them on that I don't think that's necessarily a reason and just because they publish a lot of those games on 3DS and stuff I don't think that's necessarily a reason that they're gonna purchase that company
3522535	3529281	Honestly, I think it's just going to get purchased by somebody else and it'll just continue kind of the way Atlas is going.
3529361	3537867	Maybe Marvelous USA or something like that will purchase Index Media because that's kind of all the wheelhouse there.
3538428	3539329	Here's the weird thing, though.
3539409	3543712	Today is July 28th, so it should be July 29th over in Japan.
3543872	3547175	We haven't really heard what's come of this yet.
3548656	3549477	It's also morning.
3550057	3550819	I guess that's true.
3550939	3558434	But still, that was supposed to happen on July 28th, so I'm not sure why we haven't seen a five-minute look at the news to see if anything's come out of it.
3558454	3560117	I don't see Nintendo purchasing anybody, because...
3561539	3561979	Thanks for watching!
3581484	3582325	Thank you for watching!
3596437	3625308	but the vast majority is on the 3DS still for it to be exclusive especially Persona that's a huge one right there if that series takes a leap over to Nintendo exclusive that's a big thing I am kind of of the mindset that I think most people that play Persona and again I am totally generalizing here and might be wrong fine I think most people that play Persona are the type that probably collect a lot of video game systems anyway and already have a Wii U
3626008	3630931	But I am kind of making a big assumption.
3631451	3632452	How about the reverse?
3632872	3635334	We collect a lot of systems and I haven't played a single Persona game.
3637035	3637955	Maybe now you'll have a reason to.
3638015	3638295	Who knows?
3638916	3641517	No, because I don't have a Wii U. Not yet.
3642058	3642758	Probably won't get one.
3643877	3644357	Not ever?
3644898	3646358	Mario Kart 8 won't sway you?
3647059	3648779	I was never a big Mario Kart fan.
3648839	3650560	The Mario game at the end of the year won't sway you?
3650620	3651281	There'll be something.
3651521	3653001	But I would not be surprised.
3653061	3655683	Shin Megami Tensei characters in the next Smash Bros.
3655703	3657103	game would not be surprised.
3658244	3659584	We just haven't been really excited.
3659604	3662946	I mean, if something, like, I didn't get a 3DS until Animal Crossing came out.
3663726	3665167	And what have I been playing a crap load of?
3665747	3666308	Animal Crossing?
3666488	3668068	There'll be that one game that gets you over it.
3668088	3668629	There might be.
3669349	3671330	Animal Crossing Wii U, it'll happen eventually.
3671909	3695342	I'm having more fun playing it portable but I mean but I mean I'm honestly I'm not really too excited about anything Nintendo's doing yet so alright ZZZ in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says if Nintendo bought Atlus I would put an evoker to my head IRL now now now no need for that no need for that let's not go to extremes here
3697540	3702424	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
3702784	3704565	Use the passphrase, city.
3705326	3708148	All right, DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?
3708382	3713505	Well, a whole crapload of indie developers are coming together to be a super group.
3713606	3714006	No, I'm kidding.
3714606	3715407	They're making a game.
3716247	3718669	It's called Experiment 12.
3720310	3723372	And so these are 12 different developers included.
3723512	3727655	There's Terry Kavanaugh who did VVVVVV in Super Hexagon.
3728375	3735040	Ian Snyder, Jack Kingspooner, Zaratustra, Richard Perrin, Michael Brough.
3735360	3736721	Yeah, just a bunch of people on the list.
3739123	3743166	It's supposed to be kind of an interesting game associated with mental illness.
3743866	3745127	But who knows what's going to happen.
3745167	3747649	We've only got a few screen caps out so far.
3748870	3752093	It's so far only on PC, but they're considering a Mac version.
3753774	3755615	So, interesting.
3757116	3759358	But I think it's a super group along the lines of Damn Yankees.
3761360	3763581	You know, they're going to get Ted Nugent to come out and play guitar.
3763601	3763682	What?
3766618	3769599	That is the weirdest comparison you've ever made on this program.
3769639	3770520	Congratulations.
3771300	3773161	Well, I look forward to seeing what these guys come up with.
3773461	3774261	Ted Nugent, man?
3774521	3774681	No.
3775281	3776082	Talk about crazy.
3776662	3782184	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and games that will be coming a little bit sooner than this experiment.
3782871	3785433	There's not a whole ton of stuff coming out this week.
3786114	3796503	Pretty much, we've got the collector's edition of Terraria coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3796823	3797604	That's kind of a big deal.
3797990	3804354	Yeah, it's just the game with, like, they have a pick-shaped USB drive and there's some vellum stickers and stuff.
3804674	3808716	The actual PlayStation 3 version is on, it's a card to download the game.
3809157	3811378	The 361, though, they put on discs like Minecraft, so that's kind of cool.
3812739	3812899	Um...
3813579	3815421	Rise of the Triad this week on PC.
3815841	3816962	I'm actually looking forward to that.
3817162	3818503	Is that like the remake?
3818563	3819724	That's the remake, yeah.
3819744	3821526	That's going to be coming out, so that'll be pretty sweet.
3824348	3829772	On PlayStation 3, a game which I noticed you still haven't reviewed or probably played yet, Arcania.
3830033	3832094	The Complete Tale is coming out this week on PlayStation 3.
3832134	3833836	Yeah, I've got to get my review done this week, so...
3834577	3849657	uh so that's coming out and then um I think honestly that's it and I will have you know I have opened that case all right I am just saying yeah all right no I look forward for that on vognetwork.com soon
3851238	3854580	Meanwhile, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.
3855040	3860564	August 1st on the PlayStation 3, we'll see the release of Killer is Dead, the Premium Edition.
3861265	3865207	Metro Last Like, it's a Japanese release, this week as well on August 1st.
3865667	3873733	And Sangoku Hime 2, Oki Haukou Kakosei Meshidaiga in Limited and Regular Editions comes out this week.
3874433	3875954	And I was just checking out what kind of game that is.
3875994	3879457	It looks like it's a strategy game featuring cute little anime girls.
3881058	3899899	and moving on to the Xbox 360 to see if we have anything there in Japan this week we have Killer is Dead and Metro Last Light both over there as well checking out some of the other consoles like PlayStation Vita PlayStation Vita has Mind Zero out this week on the Vita
3900640	3900920	Puppies!
3900940	3902041	I think that was a game about puppies.
3921428	3924791	Actually, I gotta say, the Wii U list looks really bare for August.
3925291	3929334	Maybe some games aren't dated yet, but the only other game for August, Wonderful 101.
3931255	3931596	Okay.
3932416	3934638	Alright, that does it for Japanese releases.
3935098	3936239	Let's check out the UK.
3936539	3937460	Only a bare few.
3938441	3940702	On... What's today again?
3941523	3941903	28th.
3942063	3949849	Yeah, on the 20... Actually, only on the 31st we have PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate HD and I didn't see anything for the beginning of August, so...
3952020	3977912	I forgot to mention since it is kind of next Sunday on the 4th I believe Pikmin 3 is coming out so that will be something yes there's that whole early release though yeah keep in mind Shadow Next Gen those were Japanese releases and I didn't see that on the list maybe that was the game that was the 8th of August so and those of you in chat that are saying Pikmin 3 is in August again those were Japanese releases I was reading
3979874	3984280	Alright, let's go to a couple more stories in the classic game of the week, Loki.
3984941	3993955	Alright, so, I mean, even we've kind of seen this a little bit, or this isn't shocking news, but even with just like our small group of...
3994715	3996217	Thank you for watching.
3996257	3997338	See you next time.
4021300	4027625	and what are they doing to, I don't know, combat that?
4028206	4029027	No one likes pandas.
4031229	4031489	Nothing.
4031809	4034832	Basically, so far they're not really saying anything.
4035553	4043861	Their comment is, despite the shrinking subscriber base, Activision Blizzard notes that World of Warcraft remains the number one subscription-based MMORPG.
4045993	4046113	So...
4065513	4083054	Warcraft is backed into a corner I think they're going to need to go free to play I don't know how long Final Fantasy 14 is going to be able to get away with a subscription model to be honest if World of Warcraft goes free to play Final Fantasy 14 Final Fantasy 14 is going to be backed into at least the buy to play like Guild Wars model it's going to have to
4083459	4084200	That's acceptable.
4084800	4087083	I'd probably play it if that was the case.
4087803	4088244	I don't know, though.
4088504	4092007	They really talk about a lot of content for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn.
4092047	4092608	I mean, we'll see.
4092648	4097252	But the problem with Warcraft is really just in this stagnant place right now.
4097452	4099875	And, you know, I don't know what to say.
4100095	4103458	It's like they do keep trying to put out these new patches and things.
4103598	4107481	Do you think they're going to do a new graphical overhaul of the whole game?
4107621	4125694	I think one of the two big things is coming with the next expansion at BlizzCon, and it's either going to be giant graphical overhaul to modernize the game, although I don't know if they would want to cut out all these... Part of WoW's allure is that it runs on old systems, but they do bump up the specs little by little each time.
4125774	4127916	Well, they could just have that as an option, you know?
4128116	4129817	Not necessarily... Perhaps, perhaps.
4130157	4149527	so I believe that will either come out or it's going to be free to play but Warcraft's kind of backed into a corner at this point it's going to be one or the other I've already quit ages ago because I mean I played through the Panda stuff and then it wasn't fun it just was more it was the same reason I was quitting before because I just kept getting bored
4150470	4175714	I also shouldn't say it's gonna go necessarily because like you know if World of Warcraft had a hundred thousand subscribers it's still making some pretty good money I mean it wouldn't be a very pleasant place but they'd still be making money but you know Blizzard is gonna get people in in other ways Hearthstone you know is a free-to-play game that's gonna bring in some cash for them the Blizzard All-Stars thing they're working on that's gonna be a free-to-play game and
4176014	4177516	That's going to bring in some cash for them.
4177836	4182780	We don't know what the hell Titan's all about, but then again, that's not really going to be out at least until 2016 at this point.
4183001	4186184	SSJ100Matt speculates that the graphic overhaul will be Titan.
4188406	4193731	You know, there is some buzz that Titan is World of Warcraft 2, but I don't know how much stock I put into that.
4193811	4196473	It's so far away that it probably doesn't even matter.
4196653	4201097	I sort of think EverQuest 2 and EverQuest kind of showed you really shouldn't do that to your MMO.
4202560	4204901	But yet, we have Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV.
4204941	4211865	Yeah, Final Fantasy XI is pretty much... It has its fans that have stuck with it this long that'll keep with it.
4211905	4212225	Who knows?
4212365	4215187	Well, hey, now that I'm working, I'm going to be playing XIV.
4215527	4217508	So, I've pretty much decided on that.
4218289	4218869	Good times.
4218909	4219669	XI needs to go free-to-play.
4220790	4221430	We'll see.
4221770	4222071	All right.
4223371	4225713	Anyhow, one more story for you guys before the Classic Game of the Week.
4227958	4230680	And it's about the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3.
4232561	4235222	It was about two years ago that Mega Man Legends 3 was cancelled.
4235522	4238504	We never really got the reasons why this game was cancelled.
4238884	4250150	But there was an interesting kind of report that came out this week about Gregaman, who's with Capcom Unity, talking about a recap of things we've already expressed in one form or another.
4250250	4256214	So sort of a, I don't know, maybe like a post-mortem now all this time later about why the game was cancelled.
4256294	4256574	Quote,
4257114	4273858	Remember that Legends 3 was essentially a 10-year late sequel to a sequel to a spinoff that had middling success even back when it was one of the only games of its kind before 3D action-adventure was an established genre, if you can even remember that far back.
4274238	4276819	And consider its place within the greater Mega Man brand.
4277379	4285663	If you thought DMC was a deviation from the Devil May Cry brand, remember that MML changed virtually everything you could possibly change about Mega Man.
4286044	4291366	Even I remember scoffing at the sight of it until I got my hands on it and realized it stood on its own merits.
4291947	4296349	Then consider that the game was designed for a platform that didn't even exist yet in the wild.
4296889	4301471	All that isn't to say that MML3 was a bad project, it was just weird.
4301852	4304593	But MML has always been a passion project,
4305033	4305974	Not a cash cow.
4306394	4307675	Hence the dev room angle.
4307995	4311677	And there is a little YouTube that showed a little bit of play from the game that's out there.
4314819	4318040	They go on to talk about involvement in the community and so forth.
4320261	4322303	At the same time, though, they're taking risks.
4322963	4324904	They're putting out risks for different things.
4325244	4327085	They're rebooting Strider.
4327125	4329807	They made the Bionic Commando game and stuff like that.
4330027	4330127	And
4331602	4360459	and you know and saying that it's completely different than the other Mega Man games well every Mega Man series is different than the other Mega Man games okay so it wasn't a 2D platformer game so what Zelda Zelda you know the 3D Zeldas weren't 2D platformer games anymore is that you're saying that that wasn't worth you know the risk I mean or you know Wind Waker is completely different than all the other games you know yet we're getting the re-release of that because apparently it just sucked so bad that we're just gonna re-release it again right you know it's not because people liked it or anything
4361059	4361680	I don't understand.
4361760	4366264	Wasn't this whole trial version of Mega Man Legends 3 they were going to put on the eShop for like five bucks?
4366304	4369066	Wasn't this practically done before they pulled the rug on it?
4369366	4369787	Pretty much.
4369847	4373890	And I thought the whole thing was just to gauge interest in that stuff.
4373930	4374711	So release it.
4375572	4376452	It doesn't make sense.
4376573	4376913	I don't know.
4377765	4378425	Make it download.
4378485	4379426	Just make it download only.
4379806	4382247	That was the plan for the prototype thing they were going to do.
4382808	4386410	They were basically going to do a paid demo to see if people were interested in the game.
4386430	4387890	Give it to some fanboys and let them finish the last steps.
4387911	4389872	That's what they do now for everything on their stuff.
4389892	4396335	Remember all the Dead Rising Zero stuff where it's a prequel but it's really just a demo.
4398516	4399217	It's disappointing.
4400157	4413510	Alright, let's travel back to a time when things were a little simpler and maybe because we didn't have the internet or anything like that, we didn't get disappointed when games suddenly got cancelled.
4413570	4416773	Although they might show up in a Nintendo Power and then suddenly disappear.
4417494	4419456	Or in this case, a Genesis Power.
4420036	4420517	Or who knows.
4420877	4422259	Or a Sega Master System Power.
4422699	4424681	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4425245	4429027	Fantasy Star, Wii, which I can't believe I haven't done this one yet.
4429167	4430228	I can't believe you haven't done it either.
4430248	4432009	You kind of brought this up earlier in the show, didn't you?
4432069	4438392	I did, because Dan's playing the Sega Ages Generation 1, which is Fantasy Star.
4438912	4448257	We bought these back when the Sega Ages ones came out, except it was all in Japanese, and our friend was trying to translate while we were playing, and she's like, oh, well, this part isn't important.
4448277	4449658	You don't need to know what they said.
4449798	4451539	So we're like, okay, we'll stop playing it.
4453740	4456240	Dan, actually, someone has done an English patch.
4456601	4459842	And I linked from the Generations one because the music in it was so good.
4460982	4465563	But the first fantasy star came out on the Master System.
4466304	4467804	And it came out in Japan on December 20th, 1987.
4467844	4470445	And then in North America and Europe in 1988.
4470485	4470865	Okay.
4473386	4484129	It is one of the I'd say granddaddies of the RPG genre and it's also one of the first games that had a female protagonist.
4485896	4487557	There have been other versions of it.
4504427	4506588	It's pretty traditional for RPG format.
4506608	4508789	You go over your overworld maps, you talk to people.
4509190	4517654	Your dungeons, though, are done sort of a pseudo-3D, where you're walking through, kind of first-person perspective, like it's, you know, Doom or something.
4518354	4527279	And then it flashes into an over-the-shoulder view when you're fighting critters and stuff.
4528280	4535245	and they even have little animations which is a lot more than Final Fantasy had at that time.
4536745	4541629	And you get different weapons and magic and you have really memorable characters.
4541649	4548133	You had Alice, you had Meow who's like this kind of cat thing and Odin and Noah.
4549414	4551415	Basically those are your main characters through the whole thing.
4551435	4552636	You've got your antagonists.
4553536	4562043	Basically, this is one of the... And especially for the Sega fans, this is the game to have.
4563144	4566266	Thankfully, we've got all the Phantasy Star games complete in their boxes.
4567327	4571390	And trust me, it's something that's just really fun to have.
4571810	4577194	Now, like I said, it did get a re-release through the Sega Ages branding.
4578302	4582730	and I think that the Generations 1 is really good.
4585540	4586901	It's basically just touched up.
4587001	4593544	It maybe looks like an early PS1 RPG, a little bit cleaner maybe.
4594305	4601668	But, I mean, you're taking a game from the Master System and updating everything in it, so it's a very, very good translation.
4601688	4607611	The music's great, the graphics are great, they're really fun to play, and there is an English patch out right now if you've got a PS2 emulator.
4608411	4612353	Although, I can't, you know, say, go do it, go do it, go do it, because that would be wrong.
4614340	4619596	Um, the game right now, as far as the Master System version, um...
4621454	4625115	It can go for a lot.
4625395	4630156	When the game first came out, it retailed for $70 and some places sold it for $80.
4631317	4636718	And keep in mind, this was an 8-bit game, so that was a lot of money for an early game.
4637859	4645641	And other ones that sold more than that were like Time Zone, but Phantasy Star was the most expensive console game ever sold at its time.
4647002	4663901	and it did get a price drop when the Master System 2 hardware came out it had sequels of course we had Phantasy Star 2, 3 and 4 if I'm right I think 3 is the one that's really hard to find of course the other ones came out on the Genesis slash Master System
4665343	4674109	With the Japanese release, one really neat thing about the first one is that it did take advantage of the FM chip, the Yamaha YM-2413 chip.
4674829	4682554	So it had some really good sound, but since the North American Impala systems didn't have that chip, it doesn't sound quite as good.
4682594	4685076	But on Virtual Console, you get an option of playing it with the FM soundtrack.
4686895	4696143	So this is probably one of the greatest video games of all time, especially in the RPG genre.
4697104	4707433	And it's actually, as far as its popularity when it came out, it actually went sort of outside video game publications and was even mentioned in, like, Boys Life.
4708834	4714299	So, which I don't even know if that magazine's out anymore, but wasn't it like one of old camping...
4714915	4717036	I thought, wasn't that the Boy Scouts magazine or something?
4717396	4718036	I thought so.
4718536	4719357	Yeah, I think it was.
4719797	4722018	I think I used to get it when I was in Cub Scouts.
4723258	4728920	But I mean, seriously, if none of you have, and I'll be honest, I didn't play it when it came out.
4729240	4729981	I haven't played it.
4730101	4731041	I played it as an adult.
4732862	4736183	But even me coming into it as an adult, I still enjoyed it.
4736983	4756123	So it's one that anyone can pick up if you love RPGs And I also, being a fan of Phantasy Star Online It's sort of neat seeing how some of the graphics in the updated version Actually correspond to some of the updates in the Phantasy Star Online series So it's pretty neat Kind of seeing where it all came from
4757212	4765655	It's like they pulled the original concepts and then with what they're doing for Phantasy Star Online, they're sort of merging the two, sort of bringing one up to date.
4766415	4770636	A little bit slightly different, but they have lots in common stylistically.
4771596	4773037	So, that's it.
4773077	4773517	Phantasy Star.
4773942	4777765	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Phantasy Star for the Sega Master System.
4777865	4782670	Although, certainly the Sega Ages series on PlayStation 2 is a big part of that as well.
4783070	4787554	Yeah, and like I said, it has been translated however you want to play it.
4788390	4790852	or watch people play it on YouTube like we've been doing here in studio.
4791613	4791993	Alright.
4792754	4794335	How much Mercedes do you have on you, Rob?
4794975	4796756	Um, 50 bucks maybe?
4797897	4803181	I had to laugh because Dan actually called me when I was in the back room last night saying, I finally got to the Rappies!
4803281	4804022	Come look at them!
4804362	4807044	I was like, I'm watching Dan kill Rappies because I hate Rappies.
4807284	4809105	Good times.
4809205	4820552	It's interesting how much of that... Playing Phantasy Star Online as much as I did, it's interesting going back to the Phantasy Star games and seeing where the Monomates and the Telepipes and all that come from.
4820612	4821693	And yes, the Rappies too.
4823334	4824735	I have to tell you a story about Julie.
4825936	4827416	You know which Julie I'm talking about.
4828317	4832420	Julie paid $120 to order a Rappie plushie.
4833220	4834581	That's as big as my upper torso.
4835305	4836706	That's dedication.
4836726	4838508	It's probably almost as wide as your table.
4838668	4839949	I have a gigantic Pikachu.
4840849	4844152	Okay, take your Pikachu and make the wrappy a little bit bigger than that.
4844252	4844512	Yeah.
4845253	4847555	And fully stuffed in, you know, with the bits and everything.
4848195	4850277	That's because she was that much into PSO at the time.
4850337	4851718	That sounds adorable.
4851978	4853519	That sounds like a waste of money.
4855041	4855801	Judge, judge, judge.
4855821	4856722	We all do silly things.
4856782	4857002	All right.
4857022	4857202	I know.
4857242	4857943	I would have just made one.
4858303	4859344	We're going to take a break, guys.
4859364	4872295	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, some rapid-fire news, of course, the mailbag, what little may be in there, and we'll talk a little bit at OUYA, and take your calls as well if we have some folks who want to call tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

4910281	4913785	I'm going to be on episode 33, part B of their show.
4914766	4919870	The episode was so long, they split it up into two parts, but I'll be on the part B, which was like almost three hours in itself.
4920311	4923273	We talked all about music games tonight was the topic.
4923694	4926216	So, or I should say today, music games was the topic.
4926316	4931341	So, you know, just having done the early days of OLR, we were nothing but music game chat.
4931701	4950543	I had a lot to talk about hence why the show was so damn long but it was a really good time we had a lot of fun taping it so be sure to check that out over at Gameboy.org episode 33B I will be on First Mate Slidekick should have that posted on Monday it's not up there yet although it is a fantabulous show you can go check out their old episodes
4951804	4954386	Alright, let's get back into some rapid fire news, Loki.
4954927	4959410	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about old games.
4960750	4962211	For example, Star Control.
4962752	4968736	Star Control was one of the franchises that was being auctioned off as part of this whole Atari...
4970475	4971716	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4999216	5000116	Wargaming Total Annihilation
5019202	5022644	Master of Orion, Moonbase Commander, Epic Gear, Tomo, Humongous Franchise,
5041555	5048318	Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise and Math Grand Prix Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise?
5048518	5050719	Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise.
5050799	5053780	I'm assuming these are all educational PC titles at some time.
5053820	5057161	What exactly would Fatty Bear get as a birthday surprise?
5057401	5058262	Of course, a fatty.
5059202	5059622	Some honey.
5060703	5061223	A rice cake.
5062771	5063432	Fatty Bear.
5063893	5064834	He gets cholesterol.
5065435	5067697	He gets... Oh, Loki, you could appreciate this.
5067818	5068639	Tangent time.
5068699	5069239	Choo-choo.
5069299	5069820	Tangent time.
5070100	5070341	Okay.
5070741	5073745	So, Alan and I went to the State Fair on Friday.
5073945	5074166	Yeah.
5074246	5077270	And you know they've got deep-fried food like crazy.
5077310	5077750	Yeah.
5077870	5078391	Act surprise.
5078471	5078832	Act surprise.
5078892	5079112	All right.
5079292	5081114	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5107981	5113125	Deep Fried Red Velvet, but we settled on Deep Fried Oreos.
5115146	5117247	And Alan, do you want to talk about how they tasted?
5118388	5122291	They were really good, but at the same time, it's almost too much.
5122571	5129376	I'm at that age where I'm like, okay, it's not disgusting, but I only just wanted one or two, and you made me eat three of them out of the four.
5130120	5131942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5149611	5151692	Yeah, so it was delicious.
5151972	5153132	Have you had deep fried Oreos, Loki?
5153713	5159355	No, but I'm very disappointed that you didn't talk about the booth dedicated to bacon.
5159595	5161135	They had a whole bacon booth.
5161375	5163336	We didn't find the bacon dedicated booth.
5163396	5168598	We saw like the chocolate covered bacon and we saw the bacon maple something something.
5168618	5170559	No, they had a whole booth that was dedicated to bacon there.
5170619	5171239	Oh, we missed that.
5171960	5172500	I didn't go.
5172841	5174082	I don't see how you could have missed that.
5174102	5177406	There should have been mile-long lines going to that booth.
5177526	5178367	No, it was empty.
5178407	5179248	We went Friday morning.
5179308	5182292	I had the day off work.
5182452	5186837	I guess Fatty Bear would want some deep-fried Oreos.
5187298	5188339	They had deep-fried bacon there.
5189284	5197570	So fried Coke is when they take funnel cake batter and they put Coke syrup in it until it turns brown inside of Coke flavored.
5197590	5200633	They drizzle it into the hot grease so that it looks like a funnel cake.
5200693	5202234	It's all just, you know, the little ropes of dough.
5202774	5206157	And then they put that in a cup and they sprinkle powdered sugar on it.
5206597	5208899	And then they put more pure Coke syrup on top of that.
5209559	5210300	And that's fried Coke.
5210480	5212201	And then fried Kool-Aid is pretty much the same thing.
5212241	5217065	They put Kool-Aid in the dough or in the batter and then they put Tarani strawberry syrup on it.
5219352	5222854	Do you remember when we did fried Twinkies at... I do.
5222894	5227578	That was like our sideshow at... It wasn't... It was... Shaft.
5227598	5227918	Shaft.
5228378	5230319	Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.
5230840	5231740	That's what we publicly called it.
5231760	5233742	We were selling deep fried Twinkies for no reason.
5233962	5235563	I mean, through half of one.
5235843	5236163	I know.
5236183	5237004	They're so... Anyway.
5238165	5238545	Let's see.
5238685	5246871	I just want to go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com because we have... Ionotropic says, Loki wants deep fried gummy bears, three pound bag version.
5246891	5247331	Okay.
5247831	5251495	Why would you want... By the way, that took me two days to get through that.
5251676	5254499	I saw a tweet from you that was like, my stomach's so full.
5254539	5256621	No, I was like, why do I keep eating these things?
5256641	5257642	Because they're delicious.
5257663	5259144	Still eating them as I'm posting it.
5259184	5259645	Delicious.
5260346	5263789	Yeah, so basically... Yeah, it took me two days to get through that three pound bag.
5264470	5264550	Um...
5265611	5267351	Yeah, actually, I wouldn't want deep fried.
5267672	5270772	It would just dissolve into mush because it would, you know, liquefy.
5270972	5272533	They had some weird stuff.
5272593	5274393	Like this one booth had like 20 different things.
5274433	5276554	There were deep fried Pop-Tarts.
5277134	5278674	And I was like, that's already bready.
5278714	5280454	Like, why would you just want to put more dough on that?
5281235	5281855	Deep fried.
5281895	5282735	Did they have deep fried?
5283275	5283995	Fruity Pebbles.
5284275	5285175	Deep fried Fruity Pebbles.
5285195	5287536	And then I think deep fried Cocoa Puffs and Captain Crunch.
5288103	5289124	Yeah, like different cereal.
5290204	5291405	Fruity Pebbles might have been alright.
5292385	5295767	See, that's something more of you bread it with that, you know?
5296087	5298208	I'm just going to tell you right now that all of that sounds really disgusting.
5298248	5298948	What gaming thing?
5299008	5300089	Fatty Bear.
5300109	5300989	Here's the one that was disgusting.
5301009	5304551	I don't remember what they called it, but it was a deep fried Twinkie with some sort of cheese on it.
5304591	5308753	I think it was either Cheez Whiz or some sort of nacho cheese wrapped in bacon.
5309713	5314876	It was a Twinkie wrapped in bacon with cheese and then deep fried.
5315056	5316697	I'm having a heart attack listening to you.
5316957	5317237	Stop.
5318654	5320855	Spray cheese is always automatically disgusting.
5320935	5322795	I'm sorry if that's true.
5322815	5324115	It's not anyone's lifestyle.
5324796	5325736	Easy cheese is gross.
5325956	5329197	When it says cheese food on the label, you know that's what cheese eats.
5329777	5330037	All right.
5330077	5331677	Anyhow, back to video game news.
5331817	5335138	Thank you, Alan, for bringing a little fatty bear to our show.
5336318	5337699	I didn't mean that in a negative way.
5337979	5338679	Where are you going?
5339279	5339499	All right.
5340734	5341154	Sorry, Loki.
5370494	5389651	and last but not least they're already talking about the DLC plan for Saints Row 4 which doesn't sound like much as far as like content stuff the first piece of DLC is going to be the Enter the Dominatrix now you may be thinking hey wait a second didn't Enter the Dominatrix become Saints Row 4 I mean they kind of expanded upon it
5390151	5395418	Well, it's not necessarily gonna be... That's kind of all the stuff they cut out of the game.
5396058	5398501	Stuff that they couldn't really work in there.
5398541	5404448	Now there's gonna be some sort of mockumentary take on all the things that they couldn't do for the game, but...
5406010	5410734	I did watch some interviews where they pulled a Bethesda where the Skyrim team had a week to develop whatever they wanted for the game
5421622	5445650	and so Saints Row they did the same thing at Volition they had all sorts of things like a dragon that breathed fire that you would have been able to ride was one of the things that you know they were going to try to do but it just didn't work in the game um you know some of the limitations and stuff so I hope some of that stuff becomes DLC that would be pretty cool but um they do have a season pass that they announced that's only two pieces of DLC and it's ten dollars
5446211	5455534	that once again as we were talking about before in part a that's a bundle that's not a season pass as a bundle of dlc because it's two the season pass is not two things
5457740	5459322	I guess I'll have to buy it because it's only two.
5459722	5464506	A season pass would be they give you these two things and then you've paid for the other stuff that comes out that season.
5464546	5469751	Well, I have a feeling there's going to be a ton of customization DLC like they've had before.
5469791	5472333	It's all paid unlock stuff.
5472513	5473894	I'm sure they're going to have that available.
5473914	5476677	That's how they did Saints Row the Third.
5478238	5478539	All right.
5479079	5483083	Well, moving on to some other stories in gaming real quick here.
5483303	5488207	Connect Sports Rivals, that was one of those games that was announced for Xbox One at E3.
5489028	5492251	It has been confirmed that it will miss the launch window.
5493152	5495213	Originally, this game was going to come out in November.
5495354	5502300	However, Microsoft told Polygon that there is a delay and it is necessary in order to give Rare enough time to polish it up.
5502660	5514264	Before launch So it just wasn't ready to go Spring of next year, the new time frame that's being given for that These things happen all of the time Launch games get pushed back Wasn't Pikmin 3 supposed to be a launch game for the Wii U?
5514284	5516324	And now it's just now coming out?
5516364	5518165	These things happen You know what?
5518325	5532109	Take the time to get it right Even though this game doesn't really sound like one I'm really interested in anyway It still might be interesting for other people It's one of those family games Yeah, it's a family game, kiddie game Families aren't going to be picking up Dead Rising 3 for their little kids True, very true
5532609	5534090	Are you kidding?
5534350	5535571	I would totally play that when I was a kid.
5535671	5545579	Hopefully this delay won't cause people to go over to the Wii U. Or, well, depending on how you look at it, maybe this delay will, yay, make people go over to the Wii U. However you're looking at it.
5545619	5550122	But the Wii U is looking at possibly a Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD bundle.
5551002	5555044	This is a report from an inventory system at a major US retailer.
5555064	5557645	We don't know which one, so take this with a grain of salt.
5558085	5563327	These stories are often a little eh, unless Loki, of course, is the one reporting on it, because I trust him.
5563347	5570750	Nintendo is looking at a Wii U bundle for Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD, supposedly a 3DS handheld that comes with Pokemon X and Pokemon Y as well.
5571070	5575271	Although, aren't there those limited edition 3DSs with Pokemon with the art on them?
5575331	5579012	I know those are coming out in Japan, so it would seem very logical those come out here, too.
5579032	5580172	Those might come out over here.
5581032	5584513	We're supposed to be getting that 3DS, the black 3DS XL, next month.
5584893	5587654	The one that was rumored to be coming out over here is actually coming over here next month.
5589494	5600377	Surprisingly enough, actually, Zelda is coming out a lot earlier than I thought it would be, because I pegged that as a November title, but they said it was October, and it's actually the first week of October, so...
5600737	5605318	Well, yeah, I was going to say, October is when these games are launching, so you could bet that this bundle will come out at the same time.
5605358	5610399	First week of October for that, and third or fourth for We Party You, which no one gives a shit about.
5610979	5611820	Hey, you never know.
5611840	5612920	There might be that one fan.
5613040	5620361	And then there's probably, I'm assuming then, you know, November is going to be the 3DSL, then, you know, Super Mario World 3D.
5620381	5620642	Whatever.
5622682	5629751	Disney is looking into a new technology called Aerial Aerial is a new invention that blows air
5637802	5640444	That's supposed to simulate a tactile experience.
5640504	5647289	So in other words, you're supposed to be able to feel objects where there might not necessarily be one because of the way the air goes.
5647850	5655856	It was created by PhD student Rajanidhar Sodhi and a Disney researcher, Ivan Popriev.
5656557	5659519	It can be placed on a TV or even on an iPad.
5659879	5664803	And it can actually simulate buttons to touching in midair to making you feel like water moving.
5665143	5691640	Stone, Sand This could actually be something really cool My mind always goes to Disney theme parks and how could that make rides feel That might be really cool I just don't understand how that would work The tech is in a very early phase so no word on where this is going They have a YouTube up if you want to see more about it There you go You alright over there?
5692194	5695116	I hate Destructoid for iPad.
5695716	5695976	Hate.
5696537	5699438	It brings up an ad and then it shuts down my Safari.
5700299	5701820	So I'm on spite.
5701860	5702740	Don't want to read that story.
5704641	5705382	Which one was it?
5706142	5707243	The Zelda mod.
5707785	5709086	I can mention it real quick here.
5709106	5710426	Yeah, please.
5710446	5715468	So Jamie out of spite will not be telling you about this Legend of Zelda mod.
5715848	5717329	It's got a great trailer, by the way.
5717589	5717949	Does it?
5718169	5719770	Yeah, it's a fantastic trailer.
5720930	5721150	Let's see.
5721190	5724952	Apparently it's this mod for Zelda.
5724972	5726492	I'm trying to figure out what Zelda game it is.
5726852	5727653	It's not for Zelda.
5727693	5733035	It's almost like all the different Zelda worlds put together.
5733275	5736196	And it's the medieval Total War.
5736216	5736416	Total War.
5736636	5737618	Oh, so it's the other way around.
5737678	5740441	It's the Zelda hack for Medieval 2.
5740762	5742004	It's really crazy.
5742044	5747872	The trailer, they've got giant characters and stuff.
5747972	5749514	Of course there's an add-on.
5749554	5751717	All I read was carrying around Link's dead corpse.
5751877	5771042	but I and I do give the ad credit because I did see the same ad earlier today and I did not know Sigur Rós had a new album coming out so I yes that was it's out now actually yes that was they're going on tour again oh I really need to see them they're a great band just just but anyways yeah there's got they've got some really crazy stuff as you get into it um
5777202	5778924	I didn't know who some of the characters were.
5778964	5780186	I mean, obviously I know who that is.
5780626	5786913	But there was, like, they had some of the guy from Majora's Mask or whatever in there.
5786933	5787955	This looks neat.
5788495	5790457	It looks very, very epic.
5791999	5793461	Some of it looks a little bad.
5793481	5794642	A little derpy, yeah.
5794983	5796504	Her crying looks a little bad.
5797265	5800828	Well, I think it's supposed to be, like, some sort of... But, yeah, like, that thing looks cool.
5800868	5807053	I don't know what that is, but... It kind of makes you want to check out Medieval 2 Total War, doesn't it?
5807253	5809274	Yeah, but, like, let's see if this is the one.
5810976	5813077	Towards the end there, they've got some really cool stuff.
5813638	5813878	Neat.
5814238	5814439	Yeah.
5815299	5816200	Okay, Jamie, there you go.
5817100	5823062	Thank you, because their page has never worked right on my iPad.
5823082	5825043	Stop crashing people's iPads, fools.
5825583	5827964	Your developers seriously need to have their hands slapped.
5828244	5828744	Just saying.
5829124	5830485	Destructoid, hire better designers.
5831665	5832185	Oh, snap.
5832225	5832886	Gauntlet thrown.
5834186	5858899	um anyway uh there is a report that a Gran Turismo movie is in development um it's uh supposed to be produced by let's see Michael DeLuca and Dana Brunetti and uh they're also the people though that are working on Fifty Shades of Shit I mean Grey so I don't know how I would think about that whatever
5860607	5870330	And then, in other news, this is, well, you know, we rag on dating games every so often, but this one is just hilarious.
5871170	5876852	There is an appearance in a dating game by Keiji Inafune.
5877712	5880914	Um, it's, uh, basically the game is called Sweet Fuse.
5881054	5882675	It's a dating game for the PSP.
5883235	5886557	And you can seduce one of seven steamy bachelors.
5887197	5887437	Ooh.
5887898	5892120	But, uh, Inafune is, uh, in the game and you can, uh, court him.
5892780	5893120	Oh, that's right.
5893140	5894701	They have that coming out on PSP over here.
5895001	5895602	The end of August.
5895942	5896202	Yeah.
5897023	5898563	Now that I know what that is, that's even creepier.
5899524	5903586	His, uh, portrait here looks creepy.
5904907	5906948	And he's listed as legendary creator.
5908385	5911188	Let's move on to some more news in the meantime
5929625	5932967	Alright, so sales haven't been that great.
5933027	5945433	There was an article that was on Gamasutra, and they were talking, or I should say polling some of the developers that have games on there, and they were talking about some of the attach rates and stuff and how not good they are.
5945953	5954238	For example, one of the games, I guess, Hidden in Plain Sight, it's brought in $4,381 on 1,900 purchases, and that was basically sold at a pay-what-you-want price, so
5959488	5959771	Minimum $1
5961628	5971811	Also, there was another game, Get On Top, that's earned $728 off of 9,700 downloads and 520 purchases off that.
5972772	5986256	They were saying some of them, like Bomb Squad, which is one of the more popular games, peaked, I guess, 200 sales per day, and now it's sort of around 70 per day, which is a $5 game.
5986316	5986356	Um...
5990017	5996440	There's a really indie guy who created a game called Bomb Ball who's made a little over $30 a day.
5997200	5998621	It's not terrible.
5998901	6003042	I mean, for an indie, maybe that's not terrible.
6004183	6010005	And then Tower Fall, which is probably one of the most notable games on the OUYA right now.
6010366	6012687	He said they've reached about 2,000 sales so far at $15 each.
6012727	6012827	So, $30,000?
6012887	6013007	Yeah.
6021227	6031837	But basically, overall, the stats have shown that I want to say that only about 27% of people that have an Ouya have actually bought games for it.
6033038	6034960	Whereas everyone else is just playing kind of free stuff.
6035000	6036122	I want to say it was 27%.
6036202	6039165	It was some ridiculously high number of people.
6039665	6046812	Now are we talking like actual free stuff like, I don't know, the Amazing Frog and the Parking Valet or No Breaks Valet and the stuff that's actually free on there?
6047092	6047913	Or do you think emulators?
6048914	6051015	I think it's just that they're playing a lot of the free stuff.
6051116	6060464	I don't think that it's necessarily... I think that a lot of the developers on there are... Yeah, 73% of owners haven't bought a thing.
6060865	6062386	So I don't think right now that
6064355	6071100	I think some of the developers that are on there probably have never published the game before.
6071460	6077505	They may not know how much of the game to give away for free.
6078185	6089894	There was something, I don't remember which game it was, where they were saying they had certain difficulty levels that were available and the higher difficulties were behind a paywall.
6090254	6090895	Thank you for watching!
6107496	6129071	so it's just I think it's a lot of it's just experiment a lot of new people putting stuff on there that you know they may not be they may not know all the tricks to being able to bring in revenue on that kind of pay model you know it leads us to this interesting comment in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com from our pal Bobby Blackwolf who says why buy games when you can pirate them so easily
6130322	6135785	Yeah, that's the thing, though, is you can't really pirate Ouya games too easily on there, at least as far as I'm aware.
6135965	6143950	You can pirate all other Android games on there quite easily, but you can't pirate Ouya games themselves very easily that I've seen.
6145411	6153896	But yeah, because they don't have the Google Play Marketplace tied to this console, there's nothing to check for the authenticity of...
6155077	6167502	Those purchases, so anything you sideload on there, if you happen to download a random API for anything, it will just run it, full version or whatever, and it'll just run it without having to purchase it.
6167542	6175004	So, yeah, in that sense, it is really easy to pirate games on there, but for the actual Ouya games, it's not, because of the way they have it.
6175064	6177005	Now, that could very well change if, you know...
6178817	6187101	I don't know what they would have to do to do that or if they can even put the Google Play Store on there I know you can sideload that but yeah it's just
6188860	6189220	DarkSakura.com
6211371	6215773	Why spend the money on an Ouya when you can just spend your money on something else that works a lot better?
6216093	6219214	It's just like a lot of people have taken the Ouya concept and made it better.
6221714	6223115	Unfortunately, there's not really anything.
6223335	6225236	They can't just put out another Ouya right now.
6225856	6230297	It's going to be very interesting to see where the Ouya ends up in about six months, right?
6230778	6230958	Yeah.
6231298	6231838	So we'll see.
6232578	6238683	All right, anyhow, moving on to another news story about a game you're not going to be able to get on the OUYA, but probably about everywhere else.
6239123	6240304	Disney Infinity.
6240805	6246969	And, you know, Disney Infinity, of course, has Toy Box, which is like the creation mode, which, you know, makes me kind of think at first about like LittleBigPlanet.
6247410	6251033	I didn't realize really how powerful this is until I saw this video.
6251833	6256597	And in this video, somebody basically recreated Super Mario Bros.
6256617	6256918	1-1.
6257558	6263323	And what's weird to me about this video is that, like, isn't this, like, an official type of, like, trailer or whatever?
6263583	6263743	Yeah.
6264144	6271250	Yeah, well, what's interesting about this is that they actually show, like, there's the little staircase with Buzz Lightyear going to a flagpole, and it's like, wait a minute!
6272231	6272771	Wait a minute!
6273132	6273712	Wait a minute!
6273852	6277075	Isn't level 1-1 kind of... It's not similar with LittleBigPlanet 2.
6277256	6278196	Yeah, I guess that's true.
6278257	6282200	And to be fair, it's just one small component that you see in the video here.
6282241	6283962	But still, wow, it looks very powerful.
6284723	6287746	And are you going to be able to share these across the internet and all that good stuff?
6287766	6289027	I'm sure you will be able to.
6289368	6290349	Yes, you will be able to.
6290409	6291550	This is going to be an interesting game.
6291750	6292351	Interesting player.
6292511	6294793	I've already seen some of the next characters coming out too.
6294953	6295274	Oh yeah?
6295354	6295674	Like what?
6296174	6296775	Like they've got...
6299958	6304462	It's not stuff that's new because they've shown them in the trailers already.
6306564	6308405	Perfect example right here.
6308445	6310728	They're going to have the stuff from Wreck-It Ralph.
6311148	6315892	They're not going to have a Wreck-It Ralph play set, but they're going to have a Wreck-It Ralph... They're going to introduce a new thing.
6316132	6318534	Instead of the play sets, it's a...
6319235	6342834	Toybox set basically it's the characters and you get pieces for the toy box instead of you know an actual play set they're gonna have a Toy Story one coming out Jack Skellington around the same time and then I think in the Toy Story one it's Buzz Lightyear and because I haven't watched Toy Story 2 it's the the female cowboy
6344175	6344555	Jesse.
6344915	6348797	So it's going to be Buzz and Jesse and then Woody sold separately.
6352499	6354000	Buzz has Jesse and no Woody.
6355681	6360984	Well, it's just they always put a female character in there because they want the appeal.
6361244	6363145	Except for the starter pack, it's all males.
6363546	6370009	But for cars and stuff, they try to put a female character in there so that girls will buy it too.
6370069	6372050	So they can play as the girl characters and stuff like that.
6372230	6372911	Yeah.
6373231	6401147	but yeah it looks fun I mean it's expensive I just don't want to buy all those characters any word about like exclusive figures only at parks or things like that I haven't heard of anything yet I mean they haven't really said that they're gonna do stuff like that it might come later on like next year I mean assuming this all takes off I know Skylanders does that they have exclusive characters for Toys R Us but usually they're just recolored characters and it's dumb
6402868	6403368	DarkSakura?
6405290	6406211	Sorry, I got tangled.
6407131	6408052	And not in a fun way either.
6409373	6416178	So anyway, we've talked a little bit about the Oculus Rift thing, about how kind of creepy it can be.
6418320	6419701	Creepy awesome.
6421022	6427527	Well, there is a Japanese sex game that will be bringing out Oculus Rift support.
6428608	6428928	Nice.
6430709	6437292	The game is called Custom Made 3D, and it basically lets you create a maid that you can play with.
6437953	6441715	And it comes with a controller called the Juicy Air Support.
6442655	6447417	It's like a move controller, but it is... It's a fleshlight controller.
6447457	6447878	Yes, it is.
6448698	6449118	So thank you.
6449819	6453841	So now, even though the game's been out for a little bit, it's got Oculus Rift support.
6453861	6454701	Okay.
6454861	6459346	So you can get your action a little bit more up close and personal.
6461688	6462409	Yeah.
6464231	6465312	Right.
6465693	6466634	Cutting edge.
6468753	6471135	Whatever you're into, have fun with that.
6471556	6472677	Whatever sinks your battleship.
6472697	6473758	It's just that whole thing.
6473798	6475840	Look, we've talked about this on the show before, right?
6475920	6482285	TTP, which is for time to penis, which usually is about peripherals.
6482485	6487670	And that is, how long will it take when they release this peripheral for someone to stick their dick in it?
6488150	6497832	or how long will it take for someone to create a giant phallus in their toy box?
6497852	6498292	10 seconds.
6501313	6504093	Here's another further proof of that.
6504154	6509455	So this great new technology comes out how long before somebody figures out how to work in wieners and boobs?
6510495	6514496	I'm sure this isn't necessarily the first attempt either as those development kits have been out for a bit.
6516116	6518837	Anyhow, just a few more stories for you guys in the mailbag.
6518897	6519237	Loki.
6520217	6532779	Alright, so Nintendo is now working to draw some indie support as well to the Wii U. Already, it's pretty easy to publish indie titles on the Wii U, and you do see a lot of indie games coming to the Wii U, especially a lot of Kickstarter-backed stuff.
6533199	6536500	You'll see, like, hey, we're making a Wii U version of it as well.
6537280	6540021	But, you know, there were some comments done by...
6542502	6564085	some of these indie developers including I guess Daco Daco is one of the studios they have a game called Scram Kitty and his buddy on the rails or buddy on rails and that'll be coming to Wii U basically they don't shout very loud about it but they are working hard behind the scenes to make their platform as welcoming as possible I gotta see what the hell this game is
6564705	6565886	Wow, that's kind of neat.
6566266	6567386	It's got a cat.
6568026	6568907	It looks kind of evil.
6569767	6572828	It's a... Puzzle platformer?
6573208	6575009	Oh, neat.
6575949	6586493	And then, of course, they're saying that... Former... I can't even pronounce this guy.
6587414	6590275	This company, Niam Niam... Where...
6591147	6593188	Niam Niam, I think that's Niam Niam.
6593368	6593828	Niam Niam.
6594629	6595249	Niam Niam.
6595369	6596109	I'm going to say Nom Nom.
6596429	6597330	Nom Nom.
6598630	6601131	They're saying they focus quality over quantity.
6602672	6609655	They're actively seeking indies, but they're looking for quality, experienced developers that can maybe form a longer-term relationship.
6612116	6616478	I guess they're bringing Tengami is the game they're bringing there.
6616938	6620719	Dreamfall Chapters Dreamfall Chapters
6640512	6641432	Thanks for watching!
6658044	6658284	Lolo Ranger
6685700	6690982	The Lone Ranger, the Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges movie really tanked too that just came out like last week.
6691002	6691422	R.I.P.D.?
6691482	6693262	Yes, that one really tanked too.
6693542	6702305	And you know some of these companies are having to take big losses on these and that's why a lot of movie companies really prefer to find these low budget movies that don't cost a lot of money that make...
6703925	6704766	Ryan Reynolds Deadpool
6725404	6725884	Here's a good example.
6725904	6726104	Clerks.
6754475	6754935	Oh, yeah.
6755576	6756296	Oh, absolutely.
6756316	6757757	Pretty much any movie that guy makes.
6757817	6759078	Except for Jersey Girl.
6759719	6760439	And Mallrats.
6760820	6762141	Mallrats was great.
6762161	6764822	But it was a good movie, but it didn't profit, really.
6765323	6767144	Not all of his movies profit, unfortunately.
6767704	6768245	So, anyhow.
6768265	6770847	I don't know how we got on that tangent.
6770887	6775470	I guess because about indie games, there's a potential for better return on investment there.
6775570	6776791	I know exactly how it happened.
6777691	6780253	Because the same thing also happens in the movie industry.
6780313	6780974	For example...
6782634	6786358	Oh, I totally forgot this movie came out this weekend.
6786398	6788261	Tigerclaw said he saw The Wolverine.
6788621	6791264	The Wolverine came out this week and did really well at the box office.
6791304	6792866	It literally made back its budget.
6792906	6794448	Wanna see it?
6794968	6797592	I do, but... It looks so terrible, too, and that's kind of...
6798979	6801701	Hey, as an 80s Wolverine reader, we're forgiving.
6802061	6804983	The weird thing to me is that I thought they already made a Wolverine movie.
6805824	6809246	I mean, I guess this is like a sequel or whatever, or a different direction.
6809286	6812128	This is taking on the whole Wolverine in Japan arc.
6812248	6813188	But it's the same guy.
6813228	6813989	It's so weird to me.
6814149	6815089	He's, I don't care.
6815189	6815730	He's pretty.
6815890	6818892	Hugh Jackman is a good actor, you know, just on the general.
6819132	6819912	I want to pet him.
6821193	6823074	I don't know that his wife would like that, but I don't care.
6823094	6823615	Of course you do.
6823675	6824075	Of course you do.
6824522	6825822	All right, moving on.
6825862	6833244	I'm sure some of you guys saw this crazy video that was out there on the internet this week where some folks were driving a car with a Nintendo controller.
6833724	6844027	Now, obviously, there are limits to this, but cables that connect the controller to the electronic unit inside the car, a 2010 Ford Escape and a Toyota Prius.
6844967	6851949	This was a project funded by DARPA, and it's to raise awareness about over-reliance on computer systems and vehicles.
6853310	6862975	One of the researchers who goes by Charlie Miller said, quote, we would love for everyone to start having a discussion about this and for manufacturers to listen and improve the security of cars.
6863415	6865076	I don't know if that's how most people are taking this.
6865136	6867238	I think most people are looking at it going, cool.
6867898	6869299	It's Mario Kart for real.
6869519	6871160	Meanwhile, we have operatorless cars.
6871718	6873359	Driver's School Driver's School
6887708	6888169	DarkSakura.com
6902725	6903586	Echolocation sensors, I think.
6920208	6920508	All right.
6920789	6923371	Well, that brings us to the mailbag.
6923431	6927836	And every week you guys can email us at mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
6928296	6932620	DarkSakura will dive in the mailbag head first and hopefully she won't find the anthrax.
6933662	6934442	But she will.
6934803	6939347	I was talking about an 80s metal band, but she will find some excellent emails.
6939367	6943011	If it's anthrax and a public enemy, sign me up.
6943251	6943571	All right.
6944052	6946774	She will find some of your emails to read here live on air.
6947015	6949437	Again, that's mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
6949477	6954261	Please feel free to email us unless you are a spammer, in which case you can fuck right off.
6954281	6955042	You can fuck off and die.
6955082	6955583	That's right.
6957044	6962009	We actually have had a last-minute, looks like, email that came after the show last week.
6962769	6970812	I emailed earlier but forgot to ask, is it possible that for the FUs of the week you could play the old Final Fantasy Advent Children's Life Raw theme?
6970892	6972352	I miss it so bad.
6972632	6974813	That should be badly, by the way, that's an adverb.
6975713	6976873	Thanks again, Reesimo.
6977233	6977774	What do you say?
6977814	6979694	Should I try to dig that up and give this guy his wish?
6979874	6980174	Sure.
6980294	6980634	Why not?
6980674	6981855	Alright, I'll dig that up while you replay.
6981875	6984236	Only if you use adverbs correctly in the future.
6986036	6987697	It's not so bad, it's so badly.
6987937	6991119	This is a conditional granted request.
6991159	6992420	We're having some faith in you.
6993380	6994961	Don't say I want that so bad.
6995061	6995922	We believe in you.
6995942	6997162	I want that so badly.
6997402	6999503	We believe in you, but don't you dare let us down.
7002985	7003306	Alright.
7003706	7003986	Awful.
7005942	7007043	Please call me Surtr.
7007343	7007944	Okay, Surtr.
7009104	7009825	Hi, OLR.
7009865	7012167	I know DarkSakura has been having house buying drama.
7012367	7013808	God, no shit, especially today.
7014288	7016310	So I thought I'd encourage her with my own success story.
7016870	7018131	Or make me jealous, I don't know.
7018711	7023335	I'm a long-term renter and I've been saving for a home, but I needed that final push to start the arduous home buying process.
7023755	7029097	The spring I was playing Animal Crossing Wild World on my 3DS XL and paying my loan to Nook and it hit me.
7029178	7030838	I should be paying off a mortgage for reals.
7031338	7033579	Long story short, I'm closing on house on August 19th.
7033700	7035881	Next I plan on getting married after playing Harvest Moon.
7036941	7037681	You gonna get a cow?
7037981	7040843	Wait, is this for real or is this kind of troll?
7040883	7041903	Like, I don't know.
7041983	7043844	Like, I kind of, like, you seriously?
7043984	7045665	Well, sometimes people have aha moments.
7045885	7046645	I guess that's true.
7047186	7056429	I'm sorry if I called you a troll, but it's just kind of amusing to me that you played Animal Crossing and you realized, wow, I should go get a house for real.
7056770	7060151	But then the whole, I should go get a girlfriend for real, that's where I'm starting to go.
7060171	7061171	Is this such a troll?
7061191	7061612	You know what?
7061672	7062172	It's funny.
7062632	7063272	I was actually...
7064933	7065433	Hey y'all Hey
7091752	7092132	Ha!
7092192	7093813	This is from Osfer.
7094753	7095594	Oh god, this is long.
7095814	7096254	Stop it!
7096354	7096814	Stop!
7097855	7103577	In the weeks following this year's E3 showing, I sought out other video game podcasts to listen to, in addition to yours, of course.
7103797	7104037	Good.
7104677	7111120	While I did enjoy some of the other shows I heard, I came to the realization that the host of OLR is what truly gives it a solid advantage over the rest of the competition.
7111540	7112020	Yes, we do.
7112140	7112781	Oh, shucks.
7113841	7120124	You have three hosts, each with very different backgrounds, and each of which cover a different social aspect and identity.
7120604	7123965	I love what each personality brings to the table as well, and I love your grammar.
7124765	7133369	Loki, while often funny, yet ranty voice of the show, plays an important role of speaking openly his thoughts on what a lot of gamers might have on their minds, but might not have the balls to speak it.
7133849	7135811	His rants are welcome, at least by myself.
7136371	7144238	He's got an amazing head on his shoulders and shows that he's very knowledgeable about the industry as a whole.
7144338	7148622	These rants only happen because he's a guy that truly cares about the games and the gamers who play them.
7148642	7152526	You know, DarkSakura, long emails are okay when they exist to inflate our egos a little bit.
7152626	7153226	Yes, thank you.
7153506	7154367	Keep going, sir.
7154467	7154908	Keep going.
7154968	7156489	Hey, it's the part about me next.
7156769	7157070	Okay.
7157490	7158531	DarkSakura is a bitch.
7158651	7158711	No.
7158791	7159492	Okay.
7161593	7162554	No.
7164374	7170916	DarkSakura is a very admirable host due to her ways in which she approaches deep gaming discussions or discussions on any topic for that matter.
7171056	7172197	Are you saying I get off topic?
7172577	7172777	Okay.
7173497	7180160	While sometimes she may be quiet for the initial talk between Rob and Loki, you can tell she has been gathering her thoughts to make some great points.
7180780	7181440	No, she hasn't.
7181480	7182520	She's been catching bugs.
7183161	7183561	I'm not.
7184361	7187442	I turned off Animal Crossing in the middle of Bobby's show just because I had a visitor.
7188062	7189903	I've been crocheting the whole time, but I've been listening.
7190123	7192984	Her penis cozy is now like a boa constrictor cozy.
7193164	7197666	You're really going to have a limited target demographic with that one.
7198406	7198886	You know what?
7199946	7200787	I'm going to say this.
7201447	7204008	It helps me concentrate to have something to do with my hands.
7205578	7230042	and as a corporate trainer during the day I can actually say that as like some people when they are actually like moving their hands it's very like they actually learn more that's why they encourage it's called kinesthetic learning oh I know I like at one meeting when I was working for the student loan place and they put out Legos to see if we retained more by playing with Legos I built a little tower but I remembered more anyway where was I more stuff about me okay
7234566	7258575	just been gathering her thoughts to make some great points and also quick to point out something the other hosts may have missed she's an awesome listener and I really admire her desire to understand what others may have trouble communicating such as the incident of an angry email the show received that bashed another host close to the OLR family even through that she calmly read through and restated the point the email was trying to get across gaming wise and that's pretty freaking awesome that she even gave it the chance well thank you
7260586	7263069	You were a saint for giving that email a chance, but yes.
7264832	7265613	And then there's Rob.
7267115	7268076	Oh, then there's that guy.
7268657	7270820	Some may say he's the glue that holds the show together.
7271200	7275486	Others may poke fun at him for making flappy hands while taking a single shot of some sort of outfit.
7275546	7276187	Thank you for watching!
7291920	7292080	Uh oh.
7312205	7318789	Rob, as a gay gamer, you've certainly felt what it's like to be pressured by your family before coming out to them.
7319430	7326975	You must know what it's like to have them wondering why you aren't trying to find a girlfriend or to feel that pressure that you have to please them by giving them grandchildren one day.
7327615	7331658	at least you might have felt that until you came out to them how did you do it?
7331958	7353312	I asked because very recently I was on a walk with my dad he's very conservative, often scoffing at any gay issue that he sees that comes up in the news yet when I showed him concerns about my uncle telling us that you choose to be gay and if you're gay you're going to hell obviously this isn't true and when I told him that I had sour feelings toward him because of it he said you shouldn't hate someone because of something they said they might just be uninformed
7353872	7358953	After this you followed up with you can be with whoever you want with as long as it makes you happy.
7359053	7361794	I don't care what you want to do with your life as long as it satisfies that.
7362874	7364714	Should I just tell my parents that I'm gay?
7365614	7370936	I know this is a tough question but I don't know anyone better to come out to about this except for yourself.
7371516	7374816	I'll make my decision based on what you tell me following this email.
7375597	7376737	Sincerely, Osfer.
7377217	7378257	P.S.
7378477	7380058	Really sorry this email is a bit long.
7380078	7381118	I just need some thoughts out there.
7381518	7382238	Can I say one thing?
7382888	7383229	Please.
7383529	7384491	Usually your parents know.
7385672	7388496	Actually, this is what I was going to get to as well.
7388576	7397889	This is a very heavy email and not about games, but I'm all about there's more to gaming than the games themselves, if that makes sense.
7398249	7398690	DarkSakura.com
7422668	7424109	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7440339	7441359	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7461325	7462386	and DarkSakura.com.
7485974	7509513	because the first thing my grandma said when my mom said Rob's gay is my grandma said so what which is a great thing I realize though that I'm very fortunate in that regard where I have a very cool supportive environment and not everybody is so lucky like your uncle sounds like a bit of a knob you know unfortunately you may not get that same level of support from him and
7509933	7521324	The point I wanted to get at, though, is that the reason why my mom escalated in asking me the question is that apparently, unbeknownst to me, I had a female friend stay the night at my place once while I was in college.
7521684	7525248	And she called her parents to ask if it was okay to stay over.
7525668	7528811	And she said, even though she was kind of whispering on the phone, she said, no, it's fine.
7528851	7529232	He's gay.
7529772	7530613	Nothing's going to happen.
7531093	7532435	My mom overheard that conversation.
7534230	7538774	So she already knew and she was waiting for me to tell her.
7539394	7543138	And she said later on, she's like, you know, I've always suspected since you were younger.
7544058	7552525	I'm not a big fan of that because I don't think that certain behaviors are indicative of certain sexuality.
7552926	7560392	We could get into this whole larger discussion about gender norms and, you know, being effeminate and gay is not necessarily the same thing.
7560592	7561973	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7584324	7605585	is it possible your parents have come across something that maybe they already have this indication and they're waiting for you to tell them now I think as far as you telling them that is really up to you you know best when the right time to tell them is I think sometimes there's a lot of pressure in the gay community to be like come out come out wherever you are come out get out of the closet da da da
7606145	7615071	I'm a little bit more of the mindset of that is a little bit more of a utopian view of where we should be but it is quite frankly dangerous in some areas to do that.
7615631	7632242	So my advice to you is if you are out on your own and living on your own and doing your own thing and making your own choices then guess what you get to live your own life and I think yeah I think it might be a good time for you to tell your parents about this especially if you get this indication that they already know.
7632842	7660921	but if you're still living at home and there's the chance there could be an ugly backlash you need to have a backup plan if you're going to tell them just in case and I pray to you that you don't have to use it and I really hope that you don't have to use that plan B but it is the smart thing to do just in case but if they did already know it might have already been ugly so I really have to say I can't sit here
7662341	7664822	and say, yes, do it or no, don't do it.
7664902	7665622	Because guess what?
7665742	7666482	I don't know your parents.
7666602	7667303	I don't know your life.
7667503	7669743	I don't know the way you conduct yourself on a day-to-day basis.
7670403	7672564	You really know the answer to this question.
7672984	7677625	But if you're in a place where your life where you can be your own person, then I say, you know what?
7678946	7679706	Go ahead and tell them.
7681206	7688670	But, you know, remember your friends, your real friends will always support you through this no matter what.
7689490	7691311	That's the most important thing.
7691971	7696193	And I will say this, I don't want to get into this too much on a video game podcast.
7697713	7701335	I did, in my mind, I did lose a brother to this issue.
7701955	7703356	He's still alive and all that stuff.
7703476	7704116	We don't speak.
7704176	7705897	I haven't spoken to him for a very long time.
7706397	7727631	and it is partially because of this issue and there will be some tough decisions you have to make along those lines but you know what I may have lost a brother there but I have made so many other close male friends that like honestly I would consider brothers that are more brothers to me than my my
7729452	7730253	It's complicated.
7730294	7731135	He's actually adopted.
7731175	7732437	But my biological amusement.
7732457	7733138	The one you grew up with.
7733559	7736203	Well, not even that because he was 14 when I was born.
7737745	7738586	My mother-brother.
7738687	7739227	We'll say that.
7740730	7744055	I feel closely to these guys than I do my mother-brother.
7745618	7747959	So, anyway, that's my very long-winded answer.
7748179	7752321	Sorry for the folks that were here to listen for the games, but maybe you were curious.
7752381	7752721	I don't know.
7753002	7758804	Well, you know, and it's... He might be the only person out there having that same sort of thought, too.
7758924	7762686	So, if it benefits somebody, then by all means, ask the difficult questions.
7762946	7763687	Yeah, so...
7764728	7785747	and you know what if you're if you're straight out there listening to this and you know maybe you don't you know take this little feedback I'm giving to Osfer here as maybe like a little bit of perspective like maybe this is why we need an event like GamerX because a lot of people respond to something like GamerX going well when's the straight gaming convention or
7786448	7814333	Okay, well when your parents kick you out of your house for being straight and you get persecuted by society for that and you are treated as a second class citizen and people pass laws against the way you are Look at Russia right now Then you can get your fucking con These are the same people who ask when we have White Pride Month Some people need a safe place Thank your white privilege that you have a safe place Yeah
7815435	7817559	That's all I'm gonna say and I'll get off my soapbox.
7817839	7819703	I swear to God that shit pisses me off.
7819723	7821506	When do I get my straight pride parade?
7821786	7823509	You get it every single fucking day.
7826194	7826916	So next email?
7828140	7828620	Yes, please.
7828900	7830681	Okay.
7831242	7832783	This is Raginator.
7833483	7834844	Hi, Loki, DarkSakura, and Rob.
7834884	7836245	It's your friendly neighborhood Raginator.
7836345	7842168	Provided that there is enough time in tonight's show, I'd like to propose that you do something akin to combining listless and classic game of the week.
7842208	7845510	Why not come up with a definitive top ten list of classic games that people should play?
7846325	7847326	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7875680	7903409	but I like your idea maybe for other topics like we need to do more like special shows and one-off things so it'll be fun yeah well um I think that's let me check and see if there's any more emails um in Korean no it's in Mandarin oh there's a thank you mail yay oh wow this is okay we got one more good thing I checked isn't it dear OLR I wanted to send you a quick email to thank you for putting on a great show for so many years
7903929	7912399	We don't always agree, but I always enjoy listening to OLR and I look forward to the next-gen discussions that will take place once we get the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in hand.
7912879	7919867	I look forward to the day when we can separate fact from fiction and conversations will be steered toward how fun Knack is or how I lapped Black Wolf in Forza 5.
7921168	7927751	I also look forward to adding everyone to my friends list on Xbox Live and PSN once the friends cap is raised with these new systems.
7928211	7940316	I know everyone likes to think I'm an Xbox fanboy but I am truly looking forward to experiencing what Sony and Microsoft have to offer us over the next five years or so as well as what Nintendo will be bringing to the table as well.
7941016	7946642	Hopefully I can accept Rob's invitation to visit OLR in person at some point since I only live a few hours away in Fresno.
7946662	7947462	I'm so sorry.
7947803	7949464	Keep up the great work.
7949784	7953688	When I ran into him at E3, I was like, you live in Fresno.
7953728	7954969	Why don't you drive up sometime?
7955009	7957932	We had a dude from Bakersfield come up and do the MS walk with us.
7957992	7960214	If he can do that, you can do this.
7960615	7962156	So yes, open invite, Shadow Next Gen.
7962176	7962997	Come on over sometimes.
7963397	7964078	And thank you for the email.
7964098	7964979	And I'm sorry for Fresno.
7967682	7968784	It's halfway to Disneyland.
7968804	7969445	Think of it that way.
7969825	7971448	No, it's near the Bravo Cheese Farms.
7971588	7973510	What about the good things that Fresno did?
7973871	7975013	I went to a Weird Al concert.
7975774	7976294	That was cool.
7978898	7979159	Love it.
7979199	7980380	Alright, thank you very much for the emails.
7980480	7981021	Ah, Bobby.
7981442	7981682	What?
7981722	7984026	Shadow Next Gen, you shut up about your Forza lapping.
7986041	7986321	All right.
7986942	7987922	Well, thank you very much.
7987942	7989463	Some really kind emails tonight.
7990164	7990824	You guys rule.
7990864	7993906	Even though we got a little heavy with one of those emails, it was a good discussion.
7994266	7994986	So you guys rule.
7995287	7995507	All right.
7995567	8006113	So speaking of emailers, we shall grant the wish of one of our emailers tonight and bring on the FUs of the week with an old school song from Orange Lounge Radio, what we used to use for the FUs of the week.
8006133	8007434	It has my stabby part in it.
8007514	8007854	Here we go.
8007874	8009795	With murder.
8009855	8010115	Yes.
8010616	8011156	Here we go.
8011216	8012377	It's the FUs of the week time.
8023143	8025565	My FU goes towards losing that house.
8026405	8033910	We had been told we lost the house, but turns out that it had actually been an old message, so we thought we got it, and it turns out we didn't.
8035571	8042876	There's a very selfish, spiteful part of me that still hopes that there's one way we can get it, but it's back to looking.
8042936	8044697	We may talk to a house flipper.
8045838	8047778	So back to the hunt.
8048899	8051639	Just ready to be done.
8051919	8052980	I'm ready to be in a new place.
8054500	8058821	And F you to my nerves because I'm pretty sure that my job is going to be awesome.
8059041	8060281	Everybody there was awesome.
8060801	8062702	All the stuff that goes with it is awesome.
8063642	8067362	I'm just a little nervy because I don't want to fuck this up.
8067382	8067643	Loki.
8069443	8069703	Loki.
8071451	8073973	Uh, that's just F you guys.
8074934	8077975	F you the fact that all my co-workers are gone.
8078816	8082238	Well, all the co-workers that used to play games with us are gone.
8082758	8084660	So now it's my boss and me.
8085220	8086941	And I kick his ass every day.
8087441	8088082	Call of Duty.
8088202	8088922	And it's just like...
8091801	8095282	And half the time he doesn't even want to play because he's got errands to run.
8096082	8098062	Our other co-worker has errands to run.
8099483	8101583	I don't even take breaks anymore.
8104284	8106644	Why bother walking over to the play game by myself?
8106664	8107924	Because it's a law.
8107944	8108745	You have to take a break.
8108985	8110185	Are you hourly or salary?
8110225	8110825	I'm hourly.
8110845	8111705	You're supposed to take a break.
8111765	8112625	I'm supposed to.
8112645	8115366	You're breaking the law.
8116246	8119267	To quote the argument sketch from Money Python...
8120908	8122529	I could be choosing to argue in my spare time.
8124210	8125631	Whatever.
8125711	8137700	So yeah, there's no point in me walking over to the game room to try to play an Xbox Live game because our live connection is absolute shit and we get disconnected all the time.
8137720	8139141	It's because we're on 20 gigs.
8143083	8165409	20 gigs down for the whole company so it's like my internet running a hundred computers it's not gonna happen so that's it all right um let's see my fu of the week um one goes to stress and uh because stress will just drive people insane stressful
8166169	8167009	Fuck up your body.
8167489	8168710	Stress sucks.
8168890	8170310	So I'm going to give an F you to stress.
8171010	8177831	And it's not necessarily me that's going through stress, but I just feel like the impact it has on other people, and it's never any fun.
8178912	8187753	So I want to also say an F you to the fact that Video Games Live was in San Francisco on Thursday and Friday, and I didn't go because I was so busy with so much other stuff going on this weekend.
8187973	8188534	I didn't go.
8189414	8191634	So I'm kind of irritated at that.
8191654	8194775	I really wanted to go, and it just wasn't going to work out for me this year.
8196456	8197877	But I do want to give a thank you.
8198537	8199618	I want to give a thank you.
8199698	8201379	Should I give some thank you music here?
8201419	8201839	Let's see.
8201899	8204901	Go back to the hippy-dippy classic Game of the Week music here.
8204941	8208083	I want to give a thank you to Brad from PodCulture.
8208704	8210905	Well, not only is he pretty much just an awesome guy.
8211085	8214708	He's helped out Horde House and so forth, and you all should be listening to PodCulture.
8215008	8219951	But he said here in chat, you never have to apologize for the tangents, serious or funny.
8220352	8225075	They are a part of you guys and thus a part of gaming and why we tune in.
8225715	8227716	So, shucks.
8228676	8229697	I just had a big smile.
8229797	8231377	You guys, many hearts.
8231597	8232197	To all of you.
8232698	8233678	Thank you to all of you.
8233738	8240160	Not just Brad, but Brad needs to share his thanks with all you guys that tune in every week, be it live or podcast form.
8240981	8241461	Aw, shucks.
8241801	8243101	You made it this far in the show.
8243141	8243762	You're awesome.
8244902	8245842	Gold star for you.
8247063	8247403	All right.
8248463	8249464	Let us move on, shall we?
8250024	8250264	Loki.
8251471	8255632	Alright, so this is kind of interesting.
8255712	8259093	It's kind of a culmination of a lawsuit that's been in the works for a while.
8259513	8273476	You may remember the original creator of Madden was filing a lawsuit against EA for some royalties that were unpaid between 1990 and 1996.
8277197	8279297	Didn't they find out there were more monies due too?
8280934	8284480	I don't know if this is the same situation, but apparently he got $11 million.
8284500	8290791	Great for him, I guess.
8291092	8292735	Finally, the Madden games are good for something.
8295282	8302352	The jury found that the games released during that time were virtually identical to the original version of Madden NFL Football developed by Antonik.
8312505	8327969	and basically saying that they, you know, I guess the Antony and his attorneys will seek to appeal previous rulings that exclude the Super Nintendo games and fraud claims from the jury deliberations.
8328689	8332030	So I think they are still going to try to seek some more money.
8332310	8337131	But right now, $11 million isn't nothing to shy away from.
8337351	8338992	So that's pretty cool.
8340518	8340978	All righty.
8341218	8344520	Maybe he can buy himself a new game studio for that amount of money.
8345561	8348802	Hey, Atlas is on the table.
8348842	8352204	There you go.
8352344	8355126	You might be able to pick up a Atari IP while you're at it.
8355906	8357607	Moving on.
8357687	8359428	This is really sad news, actually.
8359508	8360309	It kind of sucks.
8361329	8363371	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8383729	8389039	Meaning if you were looking forward to Darkstalkers 4, you'll be waiting a little bit longer.
8389360	8392165	And it's all because you didn't support Darkstalkers Resurrection.
8392205	8393307	This is basically all your fault.
8394192	8395172	I'm okay with that, to be honest.
8418223	8426989	Yeah, but okay, let's look at all the games that they've decided to put out again or make new versions of or something versus Mega Man.
8428070	8431212	We've had the Dungeons & Dragons arcade games.
8432793	8433553	Final Fight.
8434934	8438096	Final Fight's good, but... DuckTales.
8440318	8440978	Strider.
8441138	8441819	And the problem is?
8442399	8445321	The problem is, I mean, DuckTales is all good and everything.
8445361	8446282	It's not Mega Man.
8447495	8448656	Why can't we get a new Mega Man?
8448956	8452939	I mean, I guess we got Mega Man 9 and 10, but we need more Mega Man.
8453480	8457022	You're still making Dead Rising games, and those aren't that great.
8457222	8458283	I think Strider trumps it.
8461125	8462446	I have no interest in a Strider game.
8463787	8470852	Alright, well, going to the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Actdeft says, No, no, fuck Strider.
8470892	8472033	I want new Darkstalkers.
8472614	8475216	And Blackwolf says, I want new games not based on old IP.
8476317	8476637	Haters.
8477577	8477997	Let's see.
8478517	8484559	Also, ShadowNextGen says, and before I open up the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, all one word.
8484999	8488140	ShadowNextGen says, there was some fairly big Activision news that is happening.
8488180	8490281	I'm surprised no one has mentioned it, at least not yet.
8490621	8493282	You know, it did mysteriously not make the show roll.
8493322	8493602	I guess...
8494222	8494963	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8512114	8514457	It means that... 8 billion.
8514477	8515999	They paid 8 billion for themselves.
8516079	8520484	They bought out the shares that Vividi owned.
8520784	8522566	Now, Vividi still owns part of it.
8522746	8526771	It's 12% of the company versus, I guess, a controlling share or something.
8527232	8527832	Over 50%.
8528013	8530055	Yeah, so they basically bought that stuff back.
8530075	8530776	There's also another...
8531977	8534238	Some folks in the chat room are saying, Activision is now an independent company.
8534258	8534358	Yeah.
8558826	8560187	I don't know if I'd go that far
8577094	8601214	but uh it it is it's it's more interesting to see what's going to develop from this i mean from a financial investing stock side it's it's fascinating but i'm waiting to see like what does change in policy come from this because the management's not going to change the ceo doesn't change this means they make more money at the end of the day because more that they don't have to answer to a greater board of directors that's the one thing that gets cut out we can raise the prices of the games like
8601915	8602376	Yes!
8602537	8607367	Or maybe make some big decisions to take World of Warcraft free to play or whatever they gotta do.
8607567	8609491	So, be interesting.
8610356	8610576	All right.
8610896	8622286	Well, if you want to call in and talk about this, the Activision split, or anything else we've talked about this week on the show, or this week, yeah, this week, tonight on the show, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8622526	8625288	We're going to open those phones right now for you to call in.
8625629	8629552	If you have anything you want to talk about at all, you can do that right now.
8630933	8633415	Meanwhile, I will look for some last-minute stories.
8633455	8635577	I'm going to go to Twitter as well, see if there's anything on there.
8635917	8639080	But Loki, DarkSakura, either of you have some last-minute stories you want to share?
8639660	8643103	No, I mean, no, my voice decided to die.
8643243	8643704	Fair enough.
8644024	8644324	Loki?
8645926	8648468	Um, no, I don't really have anything right now.
8648628	8649329	Holy moly.
8650110	8651351	It's a slow news week.
8651651	8658137	It was a little bit of a slow news week when all that drama about the indie game and all that kind of takes center stage.
8658197	8659879	I think that kind of tells you what kind of week it was.
8660379	8666404	But, uh, okay, there's a few things that the Twitter folks are sending us, so let me read some of these tweets real quick, and maybe some of you guys heard about these stories.
8666885	8669727	Um, SSGO100Matt says, uh, there was some Punch-Out related news.
8670088	8673511	Apparently, Mike Tyson was caught by TMZ.
8673811	8679556	You know TMZ is that really trashy tabloid site that, like, stalks celebrities at airports and asks them really stupid questions?
8679976	8683079	Well, Mike, apparently one of those guys at TMZ asked Mike Tyson...
8683459	8686380	Hey, how far can you get in Mike Tyson's punch-out?
8686420	8687821	Have you been able to beat yourself?
8688161	8691003	And he said that he sucks at it, like he can't even get past the first guy.
8691403	8693004	Oh my god, that's so stupid.
8693784	8696585	Hey, Mike Tyson, what's your favorite brand of chips?
8697346	8701428	Hey, what kind of... It's like, what kind of ice cream are you like?
8701448	8703388	Is that really what they're approaching?
8703448	8706370	Well, you know, Loki, I think I like the Ruffles chips, because I don't have ears.
8706860	8708322	Is that like what they really like?
8708402	8710724	That was the worst impression by the way.
8711044	8714187	Is that like what they're really doing to celebrities nowadays?
8714247	8717130	Like stalking them to ask them really fucking stupid questions?
8717150	8718111	Have you looked at TMZ?
8718572	8719032	No.
8719152	8719673	It's awful.
8719773	8720534	It is the cesspool.
8720794	8721074	Never.
8721094	8722636	It is the cesspool of the internet.
8722916	8729042	Like if the Big Brother house is the cesspool of society, then TMZ is the pooper in that house.
8729062	8730504	Yo, Mike, what do you think about the royal baby?
8731264	8731764	Who cares?
8731844	8734366	Alright, look, we got a call.
8735526	8736667	Hi, you're on Orange Slimes Radio.
8736687	8737107	Who's this?
8737767	8743170	I just want you to know I had to bite my tongue during that whole segment so I wouldn't bust out in full laughter.
8743630	8744911	Did you like my impression?
8745791	8746491	Oh, God.
8747052	8748032	You're just terrible, man.
8748052	8749173	Just terrible.
8749193	8749413	Alright.
8749953	8750853	What's on your mind, buddy?
8751774	8752134	Not much.
8752174	8756176	First, I want to say the advice that you gave earlier in the podcast...
8759332	8759732	Thank you.
8759972	8760313	Thank you.
8760533	8761014	It means a lot.
8761975	8764419	It does because I'm dealing with some similar issues.
8764439	8770508	I have to tell you about that another time, but I truly understand somewhat where you're coming from with this and that.
8772290	8774613	But I actually called in to let you know that
8775703	8783465	I'm actually getting my replacement headset from Astro Gaming.
8785286	8794048	Long story short, I was having issues with the mixer and the headset and it took them maybe about several months through various emails to try to get it fixed.
8794668	8798230	The mixer got replaced, the mic got replaced, but not the headset.
8798710	8800391	The problem still persisted.
8800971	8810355	It's like the clouds in the sky parted and the sun shone through and all these customer service issues are getting fixed this week because Loki's finally getting his damn controller, too, for the OUYA.
8810375	8811255	Well, allegedly.
8811295	8812796	I mean, until that thing shows up.
8812836	8819119	Except it's coming from DHL, so it'll be probably fired out of a cannon across the Pacific Ocean and hopefully land.
8819159	8820359	I gotta get my OUYA back for me this week.
8820379	8821960	They're delivering by carrier pigeon.
8821980	8822480	Woo!
8823521	8843902	that's because DHL packed it up and left they couldn't compete with FedEx and UPS they closed up several years ago it's just whatever's left well congratulations on getting what you needed from the company it's a good happy end to the story we hope
8844721	8846203	It took two phone calls.
8846443	8847464	The guy called me back.
8847704	8849005	I explained everything.
8849165	8855030	So they sent me a brand new 2013 kit and the appropriate cables for the new mixer.
8856271	8865378	DarkTetsuya in our chat room, sorry to go on a tangent here real quick, but says about the whole Mike Tyson impression I did earlier, Rob should really get into VA work after this OLR thing ends.
8865698	8867560	Dude, why do I have to wait for OLR to end?
8867620	8868740	You want OLR to end?
8868841	8869201	Fine.
8869501	8870482	Last show, everybody.
8870582	8871002	Bye.
8871222	8871323	No.
8872403	8872823	Not really.
8873063	8876665	That means Ook-chan gets started on OLR, the Flash animated series.
8877665	8879646	Why does that have to be something we wait on?
8880266	8881046	You know what?
8881386	8882707	I did used to want to be a voice actor.
8882827	8883847	Yeah, the VA thing?
8884087	8886148	I would be so down with that.
8887068	8888169	Throw me a script, people!
8888209	8897074	I'm not very good at pursuing that stuff on my own because I do have a day job and all that, but it would be a dream to be a cartoon character or something.
8897454	8898695	So, absolutely.
8899695	8902857	Throw an idea my way and I'd be happy to do it.
8902917	8904358	Even if it's just a little cameo.
8904738	8908761	Even if I have to play derpy hooves or whatever, I'll do it.
8912022	8912343	Anyhow.
8913483	8914584	What else is going on with you, Rama?
8914604	8915184	What else in gaming?
8915204	8916105	What have you been playing lately?
8917929	8922572	You might get mad if I tell you the game I've been playing for the last several weeks.
8922672	8923152	Try me.
8923292	8924412	Sailor Moon S Fighting Game.
8925193	8926473	No.
8927154	8928915	I've been playing Candy Crush Saga.
8929055	8929755	Oh, God.
8930115	8933657	JudgingYou.com I'm judging you times two.
8933797	8934557	Actually, is that a site?
8934617	8934937	I don't know.
8934997	8938039	That's coming from people who play Warcraft and FFXI.
8938439	8939900	For shame, good people.
8940120	8941200	For shame.
8941441	8942181	Okay, look.
8942201	8943521	Bobby told us to hang up on you.
8944802	8947323	We're not gonna because we have some tolerance, but still.
8948204	8948544	Judging.
8950185	8954987	Wow, somebody has judgingyou.com and it says it's currently under construction.
8955067	8956008	It looks like a webpage from 2005.
8956368	8959570	And now we're judging you, judgingyou.com.
8959610	8961971	Yeah, I'm totally judging you, judgingyou.com.
8962651	8963431	Alright, anyhow.
8965613	8968214	Candy Crush Saga, what stage are you on in Candy Crush?
8968234	8968214	315.
8968834	8969134	Holy shit!
8969154	8972616	How much have you spent?
8975091	8975351	None.
8975371	8977513	Wow, okay, I am kind of impressed.
8977573	8978655	You know, I blocked that today.
8978855	8985021	Some of those levels are pretty fucking impossible without buying power-ups, so applause to you, my friend.
8985421	8991207	No, no applause, because I'll be the first one to admit that I cheated on half those levels, and you know what?
8991727	8993309	Even with all the extra power-ups...
8994212	8998056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9014230	9015131	I play on my tablet.
9015591	9022256	And believe it or not, even though it's an online game, there are ways to access the Facebook app through third-party applications.
9022837	9023177	Oh, okay.
9023557	9023897	Alright.
9024158	9024738	Gotcha, gotcha.
9025579	9027080	Alright, well thanks for the call, Ranma.
9027160	9029362	I'm going to let you go and try to get some more calls, okay?
9030002	9030482	No problem.
9030743	9031783	Stay fabulous, darling.
9031983	9032924	I will, always.
9033785	9034245	Stay black.
9035746	9036207	You got it!
9036567	9037408	Alright, bye.
9039540	9047063	And for anyone that's been a long-running inside joke on the show, just to be clear, it's something that Dan started, which was hilarious.
9047284	9048464	Because my husband's a douche.
9048484	9052666	Well, he didn't know what else to say in that moment, so it was just really funny when he said that.
9053186	9053747	All right, anyhow.
9055250	9059512	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, I'm sad to report that Candy Crush Jam Session has been cancelled.
9061113	9063474	Oh, I didn't let poor Ranma plug Anime Jam Session.
9063494	9064854	Well, you should listen on Tuesday nights.
9065575	9068676	Alright, let's go back to the phones.
9068696	9072678	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9073438	9075199	Otherwise, I still have some more tweets for you guys.
9075760	9080403	SSJ100Matt did have a second Punch Out tweet for us, and that is, A gaming did you know?
9080943	9087287	The title theme to Punch Out came from Gillette's Cavalcade of Sports 1950 intro.
9087707	9092730	And Bobby Black will follow that up with, it actually was one of Gillette's theme songs, very famous back then.
9092770	9095892	Here's Boston Pop's version, and a whole bunch of YouTubes were linked.
9096273	9096433	So...
9097233	9098814	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9123747	9129929	I watched a video today of Left 4 Dead 2 mods that had Whitney Houston as a playable character.
9129949	9130989	Oh my, that's terrible.
9132009	9132709	That's terrible.
9134030	9136230	Again, just putting a shout out there for some phone calls.
9136330	9139611	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9139671	9142072	Rob, remember when we used to make the RIP names in WoW?
9143314	9144514	Yeah, I still have R.I.P.
9144554	9146215	Betty White, just for the day.
9146535	9148256	And I, you know, again, guys.
9148296	9148976	I had R.I.P.
9149016	9149296	Whitney.
9149616	9152217	I love that woman, and I don't want that to happen.
9152417	9154658	But when it does, I'll be ready.
9155118	9156018	You know what I still had?
9156518	9157199	Rebecca Black.
9158259	9160300	She was, like, max level at one point.
9160480	9161260	She's 85 right now.
9161320	9161780	Actually, no, she's 86.
9161880	9167382	Hey, you can always start Final Fantasy XIV and have Rebecca Black mage.
9169393	9170313	I actually like that.
9170333	9171154	That's really funny.
9171174	9171494	You know what?
9171534	9172195	Maybe I'll do that.
9172815	9173736	Rebecca Black Mage.
9173756	9176918	I'll make like a human character in 14 and do Rebecca Black Mage.
9178119	9178760	I love that.
9179460	9185565	I was going to name my Final Fantasy 14 character because originally my little Taro Taro was named Lil Poundcake.
9186803	9188564	Which, if you watch RuPaul's Drag Race, you'll understand why.
9189384	9189964	Which was great.
9190104	9196247	But now I think I'm going to have a character, a human, because Shane's convinced me I need to play a human.
9196487	9200469	I think I'm going to name her Lisa Turtle, after one of my favorite Saved by the Bell characters.
9200809	9202469	Because Lark Vujerys is a hot mess now.
9202509	9203570	You want to know what's funny?
9203970	9206071	Is that I've managed to get Homestuck names.
9206651	9206911	Oh yeah?
9207111	9208092	On the busiest server.
9208352	9208592	Nice.
9209352	9210193	and no one else had them.
9210393	9211693	So I was like, heck yeah.
9211793	9212194	Heck yeah.
9212514	9213774	So is Skype working, y'all?
9213854	9214335	Poke, poke.
9214555	9217596	I'll give it a few more minutes, but if nobody else calls in, I guess we'll call it a show.
9218317	9220037	We do have a few tweets from Tigerclaw, however.
9220518	9224280	Disney registers some Star Wars Attack Squadron domains.
9224860	9225540	Hmm.
9226361	9227581	Possible announcement for later.
9227981	9234385	And PlayStation 4 devs can only use 4.5 gigabytes of the system's 8 gigabyte RAM.
9235525	9236987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9262149	9267453	Hey, the FCC report came out from PlayStation 4, I think even the Xbox One.
9267733	9270215	We now know what the operating temperature is going to be.
9270735	9275598	Who the fuck cares what the goddamn operating temperature of a console is going to be?
9276138	9276979	It makes no sense.
9277921	9278601	It's nothing.
9278801	9282523	It's just another article they can get some fucking hits on their website for.
9285964	9287084	It's ridiculous.
9288645	9289885	We don't know what the hell that means.
9290006	9290866	I don't think it means anything.
9291466	9291786	So what?
9292466	9301170	Because I bet you anything with three fucking operating systems on the goddamn Xbox One, there's going to be a good chunk of that that's going to be dedicated to those.
9302330	9307413	However, there was a rumor I saw that they're going to allow some of that for indie developers.
9307453	9309435	But I think all that stuff is just being pulled out of someone's ass.
9309475	9312076	I mean, no one knows what the hell is going to happen.
9312236	9317059	And it doesn't matter in the end of the day because there wasn't that much RAM on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
9317460	9321422	So, you know, there's some pretty good games on those consoles.
9323063	9323864	I don't think it's a big deal.
9324604	9326025	We'll just play the games.
9326085	9327126	Who gives a shit about the specs?
9327346	9328046	Just play the games.
9328146	9328527	They're good.
9328727	9328887	Cool.
9330411	9331872	How the magic's done, no one cares.
9332112	9334673	All right, we do have another call coming in, so let's go to it.
9334713	9335594	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9335614	9335934	Who's this?
9336754	9337995	Hi, this is Raging Eater.
9338035	9338635	Hey, Raging Eater.
9338655	9339316	What's on your mind, buddy?
9340436	9341637	Not much.
9342337	9350681	Yeah, I just thought I'd call in with two very quick topics just in case someone else wants to call in.
9351102	9351302	Sure.
9352522	9357585	Yeah, although the first talk is probably more appropriate for an anime jam session kind of thing.
9360132	9363693	We have a series called Gunslinger Girl.
9368694	9372535	For those that haven't heard of it, it's an anime series.
9372635	9375776	It's two seasons long plus it has two OVAs.
9376596	9381697	It basically centers around an agency in Italy that
9382621	9385163	has like a social welfare front.
9385203	9391066	It's really like a spy and CIA type of agency in reality.
9391867	9393728	And it involves cyborgs.
9394068	9399531	I'm probably not doing the series justice by describing it.
9400792	9403374	But needless to say, it's a very excellent series.
9405415	9410178	For those that haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a while,
9411005	9416612	and you like anime or at least someone interested in anime, I suggest watching.
9417172	9419195	Wait, was there a question in there somewhere?
9419876	9420657	Well, is that...
9423992	9426953	It's not so much a question, but a recommendation.
9427153	9428114	No, okay, it's all good.
9428174	9429654	I thought you said it was a question.
9429674	9430835	I think I'll just watch Dollhouse.
9431135	9433356	Yeah, no, it sounds interesting.
9433376	9434476	It was poor crazy on my part.
9434616	9435176	No, that's all right.
9435476	9438337	I just don't watch a lot of anime, but not that it's bad.
9438397	9439378	I don't dislike it.
9439418	9442839	I just hardly watch any TV at all because I'm always playing video games.
9444020	9446400	So, yeah, but it sounds cool.
9447721	9450462	I'll add that to my ever-growing list of shit to catch up on.
9453253	9461519	Well, it's probably one of those series that is probably really great for those that don't watch a whole lot of anime.
9461539	9466022	You know, it's like an entry-level anime.
9466723	9471246	It's one of the first series I watched, and I still love it.
9471366	9474269	That makes me so incredibly sad to hear that.
9474469	9475029	Really, it does.
9476430	9476870	Why is that?
9477870	9492077	because I remember my introductions to anime were classics like Ranma and Devil Hunter Yoko and then watching Robotech when I was a little kid and Voltron and all that.
9493118	9503083	Technically, I did see Robotech a few episodes of that when I was a kid but I really don't remember too much of it and I wasn't even sure if Voltron qualified as
9503900	9504581	and me or not.
9504601	9506442	As far as I know, there was American Beauty.
9506502	9507362	It was Matt Cross.
9507442	9508483	It definitely qualifies.
9510865	9512026	Well, then I stand corrected.
9512046	9519611	Alright, well, anyway, just to switch gears so I can hurry this call up to keep someone on the calls in.
9522212	9533160	As you may or may not be aware, in case you haven't seen me on scheme, I've finally gotten into the Civ games and both 4 and 5
9534285	9558938	and thanks to BlackWolf and I'm loving them and um I was thinking you know uh although I kind of brought up briefly the other day when you were doing the noob nights on uh Borderlands 2 one of these days we all should have like a VOG community night on set five maybe again like a pretty decent game going I don't know what the
9560155	9563518	I think it's eight.
9564038	9564379	I think.
9564439	9565179	Don't hold me on that.
9566220	9567321	Alright.
9567701	9567961	Yeah.
9568081	9573766	Since I guess that's one of the games to play on Steam, from what I can tell, it's pretty popular.
9573786	9575047	We should probably get like a
9576287	9577508	Community Night going on, yeah.
9598643	9602865	Even if there's noobs, the problem is one person can really hold up those games.
9603246	9608008	So everybody has to be well-versed enough in Civ to keep the game moving.
9608348	9613811	It would be one thing for just Shane and I to play, because he hasn't played at all, so he has to learn.
9614191	9616112	So that could kind of move at one pace.
9616172	9621655	But if eight of us are going to play, we all need to be relatively familiar enough with the game to keep it moving.
9621735	9626077	Because otherwise, we're going to need 120 hours to play that fucking game.
9626874	9637680	Yeah, I'll be first to admit that, you know, I'm not on the same expert level as, say, like you or... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
9637900	9638940	Put the car apart.
9639161	9642462	Wait, wait, put the car apart, because I am by no means an expert at Civ.
9642642	9644103	I'm actually quite bad at it.
9644143	9647185	I don't have the strategical mind it takes to play a game like that.
9647545	9654749	But I'm just saying, you don't have to necessarily be good, but you just have to be able to move relatively fast and not get yourself held up.
9656285	9672777	Yeah, well, I was going to say, I'm not as good as some of the other people within the VOG community, but ever since playing the game for the first time during that free weekend, I've certainly gotten a whole lot better.
9675239	9682744	But for those that don't already have the game, either Civ IV or Civ V on Steam already,
9684332	9686473	I definitely recommend getting those games.
9686493	9687834	They're really, really great.
9688014	9693257	You missed the hell out during the Steam sale, to be honest, but hopefully it'll be on a Flash sale again in the coming weeks.
9693537	9695118	Yeah, hopefully.
9695158	9696859	Well, I'll let you go.
9696939	9702082	I'm sure you probably want to get more calls or wrap up the show, but it's been a blast talking to you.
9702282	9703243	Alright, take care, Spazinator.
9703263	9703743	Good to hear from you.
9704464	9705524	Alright, nice talking to you, too.
9705544	9705604	Bye.
9708163	9710064	I always appreciate an endorsement for Civ.
9710084	9713486	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9713506	9715707	We'll give it about one more minute, see if any other calls come in.
9716508	9717488	Did I do all the tweets?
9717528	9727834	I think I did the last one there, because that was from Tigerclaw, about the partial system RAM, and we were kind of talking about other systems and that whole thing.
9728254	9728734	Oh, excuse me.
9729294	9730295	But that was it for tweets.
9731235	9734696	But if you want to send us a tweet in a future week, twitter.com slash OLR.
9734736	9740637	And if you want to send us an email for a future week, of course, that address is mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
9741757	9745478	I do not see the phone ringing here and we are out of last minute news, right?
9745558	9748119	So I think we got to close up shop.
9748139	9748379	That's it.
9748399	9749019	I'm going to go ahead and close.
9749039	9751160	We're having big discussion on old school anime now.
9751300	9751660	Oh, are you?
9752260	9753481	Like what?
9753841	9756963	Ranma just brought up Devil Hunter Yoko, which is one of my favorite old series.
9756983	9761266	Well, actually, it was good through the first three OAVs.
9762487	9769932	But we have talk about the most depressing stuff like Dog of Flanders and watching certain episodes of Galaxy Express 3-9.
9770852	9776376	And we're going back to the 70s and the late 60s now for our references.
9776476	9777276	So it's pretty cool.
9777296	9780799	But I have to say that one of my favorite of all time, 80s Dirty Pair.
9781520	9782007	Heck yeah.
9782705	9783886	All right.
9783926	9786747	Well, I guess I'll close up the Skype line since nobody else was calling in.
9786767	9788187	But thank you to those that did call in.
9788227	9793850	And if you do want to comment on the show, mailbag at orange lingerie dot com or, of course, tweets and Facebook.
9794510	9798472	As a reminder, we will be off next week since I will be out of town.
9799352	9801953	So, you know, and plus we just we haven't had a week off in a while.
9802034	9803534	Sometimes we want a frickin vacation.
9803614	9807456	So I believe Bobby is still here live, though, at the Voice Geeks Network.
9807476	9812038	So please still tune in to support him and all the other shows that air on the network throughout the week.
9813579	9814720	We'll be back in two weeks.
9815700	9819843	Before we wrap it up, I do want to say thank you as always for listening to our show and downloading the show.
9820203	9821824	We do do this for free.
9821864	9825886	We don't ask for your money unless, you know, there's like a charity event going on or something.
9826607	9829789	But we just say, hey, tell a friend or two about the show.
9830089	9833931	Help spread the word about our show and just help the family grow a little bit.
9834252	9835132	That's all we want.
9835232	9836093	Help the Oil Army grow.
9836913	9856413	um meanwhile let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts since we're closing up shop here um DarkSakura and your boa constrictor cozy what is your final thought today I'm almost done with this thing but we also have other good references to other stuff like Zenki Record of Lodoss War Record of Lodoss War by the way inspired one of my first D&D characters oh really yes
9858195	9864978	My final thought tonight is I had this Chex mix today that's called Honey Nut Sweet and Salty and it's delish.
9865378	9867339	It's like the Honey Nut Cheerios mix they used to sell.
9867359	9868440	It's almost the exact same thing.
9868800	9869561	Cool story, huh?
9870361	9872302	Loki, your last minute thought tonight or final thought.
9872622	9874623	I see Bobby's going back to play Saints Row 4.
9874823	9875164	You know what?
9875224	9878385	I'm just going to go make my own Saints Row 4 with hookers and blackjack.
9878945	9879806	Or maybe no blackjack.
9882341	9884342	Actually, I'm pretty sure Saints Row 4 probably has hookers.
9884703	9886064	Maybe that's so much blackjack.
9886084	9890086	Are you still going to do your game programming thing on a smaller scale where you do a blackjack?
9890246	9894489	Because you could still make slutty blackjack or slutty breakout.
9894509	9895890	You know, because there wasn't that much.
9896030	9897531	I would say there was not really very...
9898792	9899713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9921750	9922890	You do you on that.
9923030	9923470	Oh, that's fine.
9923570	9928472	I had to play Borderlands the other day anyway, so, you know, to level up.
9928612	9930592	Sometimes there's just more important things like Borderlands.
9930612	9932693	Well, I had to level up so I can, you know, I can play with you guys.
9932833	9933613	All right, fair enough.
9933993	9936134	All right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9936434	9937734	Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
9937814	9940595	We will be back in two weeks with episode number 515.
9940775	9943996	I will see some of you next week at GamerX.
9944396	9946976	Please, if you do see me around the convention, just come up and say hi.
9947116	9948077	I don't bite, I promise.
9948377	9949757	I want to meet many of you while I'm there.
9950878	9954120	And for those that are not going to be in the area, have a great week off.
9954380	9956502	Maybe I'll see you online gaming and so forth.
9956542	9958923	Don't forget we have a Steam community and some other communities as well.
9959363	9962406	And maybe this epic Civ night will have to happen at some point too.
9962926	9963887	Have a great two weeks.
9964067	9966428	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
