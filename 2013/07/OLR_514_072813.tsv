7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight, July 28th, 2013, self-publishing will soon be a reality on the Xbox.
20000	23000	A report is in on Gluya Game Tales, which might surprise you.
23000	27000	And we get more insight as to why one fan-anticipated game was canceled.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this July the 28th of 2013, episode number 514 of our show.
45000	49000	We're here to talk to you guys about the latest and greatest in video gaming.
49000	51000	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
51000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	57000	Hi.
57000	58000	How are you doing?
58000	62000	Well, I don't know. My voice decided to die just before the show.
62000	63000	That's not good.
63000	65000	So I'm going to have some more of your delicious coffee.
65000	68000	Mine's hurting a little bit today too, which we'll talk about in a minute.
68000	72000	So did you do it with the wrench in the Billard's room?
72000	74000	I'll talk all about that in a moment.
74000	77000	But say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
77000	78000	Hello.
78000	79000	How you doing Techmaster Loki?
79000	82000	I'm getting full though. I still have another burger.
82000	84000	Another burger to down.
84000	87000	Oh yeah, that's right. You've ditched your fries in favor of two burgers.
87000	90000	Well, not today. I actually wanted to get fries today just because I was a little hungry.
90000	93000	You're being a little bit of a piggy today.
93000	96000	But they're good fries. Usually they're not good fries.
96000	104000	It's kind of the Russian roulette of drive-thru fast food, I guess. McDonald's fries.
104000	109000	Alright, and of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern
109000	115000	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
115000	120000	And when you do listen to our show live, you can check in and show that you're participating with the show.
120000	124000	I did just turn those on. Sorry, I'm lagging a little bit tonight.
124000	128000	You guys might have to carry the show a little bit tonight. I am pooped.
128000	132000	I had a super long weekend this weekend.
132000	134000	We don't want to know about your poop.
134000	138000	I may not have gone poop all weekend. I've been that busy.
138000	141000	Are you that uptight?
141000	144000	Sounds like a personal problem, Rob.
144000	148000	Well, here's the thing. As Jamie referenced a minute ago, last night was the big clue show.
148000	152000	And I'm sure those of you that do listen to Understation Live here at the Voice of Geeks Network,
152000	155000	you've probably heard Jessica talking about it, and I've referenced it too.
155000	160000	That was the big show last night, which not only was the show, but all day leading up to that show.
160000	164000	And then all week leading up to the show and the Saturdays before that.
164000	168000	But the show went really well, and there was a really large turnout.
168000	173000	A little larger than I honestly would have expected, just because a clue doesn't have...
173000	178000	I mean, a lot of people love that movie, but it doesn't have that same Rocky Horror Picture Show thing going on,
178000	181000	or even Repo, the genetic opera, and some of the other cult movies.
181000	186000	It doesn't really have that base built around it, but I think last night kind of showed there's more of a desire for that.
186000	189000	So that was very exciting.
189000	194000	So there was that, and then this morning, my buddies Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick,
194000	201000	and Tim from Crystal D were all here, and they graciously let me guest on Game Buoy podcast.
201000	203000	We used the studio here to do that.
203000	207000	So I've already done one three-hour podcast today, so now there's this.
207000	209000	There was Clue yesterday, there was...
209000	215000	It's like I had Friday off of work and it still wasn't enough, because I kind of want to call in tomorrow.
215000	217000	Yeah, me too.
217000	219000	Aren't you starting your job tomorrow?
219000	221000	Yes. No.
221000	229000	So yeah, I took a Tylenol PM last night, which I don't usually do, and so I'm feeling really groggy today.
229000	233000	It's like I can't kick this grog thing I've got going on.
233000	237000	So I've just decided during tonight's show, you know what? Fuck it.
237000	241000	I said, Alan! Alan! Do we have any wine?
241000	243000	He's like, yes, we have like four bottles. What do you want?
243000	246000	I'm like, I don't care. I want wine.
246000	249000	I don't know what it is, but serve it to me in a Coke bottle.
249000	259000	Exactly. So the wonderful Alan is over there right now cracking open a bottle of wine for me so I can have a little bit of a celebratory drink.
259000	264000	Because it was a really kick-ass weekend, I will say that. I got to see a lot of people last night.
264000	272000	Honestly, I host the thing too, so usually I'm up there on the stage kind of greeting the audience, getting everybody going.
272000	278000	And I felt like, and I don't usually, I'm usually the first to be self-deprecating about myself and joke about my thing,
278000	281000	but I actually think I did a really good job of my improv last night.
281000	284000	And so it actually kind of made me go like, wow, why don't I do this more often?
284000	290000	And I'm like, oh yeah, I have a three-hour radio show every week where I get to kind of practice the speaking skills a little bit.
290000	296000	So there you go. Oh, Alan, you rule. Thank you so much. You want to say hi to listeners?
296000	297000	Hi, listeners.
297000	305000	Thank you. Mmm. This first sip of wine is for all you guys. Delicious.
305000	306000	Is it sweet and fruity?
306000	308000	It is extremely sweet and extremely fruity. You want a sip?
308000	309000	Sure.
309000	317000	Okay. All right. Let's see. I was going to, oh yes, entire, entire, what?
317000	319000	That's actually really good. It tastes like candy.
319000	320000	Isn't it?
320000	321000	It actually tastes like sweet tarts.
321000	322000	It's great.
322000	323000	Doesn't it?
323000	326000	It's from a local winery. We actually drive out there to the winery. It's only about a 30-minute drive.
326000	329000	Next time you go grab me a bottle. I'm serious. I'll pay you for it.
329000	333000	Get you addicted. Tiger Claw on our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
333000	338000	We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
338000	345000	And Tiger Claw says, Rob did something he hasn't done in ages. He shaved. That's right. I am a beardless.
345000	346000	His legs are smooth.
346000	355000	No. I'm beardless for the first time in a couple of years, I think at this point. So, I mean, I used to, like for most of my twenties, I didn't have a beard.
355000	357000	The last time you did it was for Rocky, wasn't it? Or for Repo.
357000	364000	Yeah. Rocky or Repo. One of those. But again, last night, Colonel Mustard, who I was playing in the movie, only has a mustache.
364000	371000	So I took it down to my porn stash yesterday, which the minute I walk out of the bathroom, Alan goes, Oh, Freddie Mercury, I love your work.
371000	378000	I'm like, fuck off. So I shaved off the mustache last night. So now I'm clean shaven again.
378000	379000	The show must go on.
379000	385000	Yes. I want to break free. Anyway.
385000	388000	Was your makeup flaking, but still.
388000	396000	But anyway, so I'm trying to grow back at least some scruff for GamerX because I'm going from one busy weekend to another.
396000	402000	GamerX is next weekend in San Francisco. We will not be here live because of it. I'm sorry. Sorry about it.
402000	408000	But I won't be back on Sunday night for the show. So unfortunately, Studio OLR will be closed on Sunday.
408000	413000	So look, you get a week off to do whatever and, Dr. Soccer, you can come feed Sanrio.
413000	421000	You know what? GamerX would probably just be like the ultimate dream of any convention because I don't know.
421000	427000	Well, just would be fun. You love gay men and women. You love video games.
427000	430000	I'm expecting that there will also be more bathed people.
430000	435000	Yes, I'm hoping for that, too. So it's going to be a good time. I can't wait.
435000	439000	So, fabulous people, fabulous games, and no con-funk.
439000	445000	You know what they need to do, and this goes for pretty much any con, and I know it might annoy some people and stuff,
445000	452000	but they need to have, what was it? Oh, what the fuck is that place now?
452000	459000	The place with all the stinky fucking shit. I keep wanting to say Bed Bath and Beyond, but it's not Bed Bath and Beyond.
459000	466000	It's Perfumania. God damn, I don't remember the place now. Bath and Body Works, there you go.
466000	472000	You need to have a booth there because their stores fucking reek, but they reek of flowery stuff, not con-funk.
472000	478000	So you get them, you put them in the middle of the con, and then it just kind of averages itself out.
478000	486000	I was there at the AX that people were passing out hygiene bags. It was the last AX I went to, by the way.
486000	492000	Anyhow, this is important to say. GamerX is not just for gay people. It's for everybody.
492000	499000	It's just, you know, it's an all-inclusive event. It's for everybody, and I think it's going to be a good time.
499000	507000	I am co-hosting, co-being on a panel on Saturday. I think it's six, it's five or six. I can't even remember at this point.
508000	509000	You're co-paneling.
509000	519000	I'm co-paneling Podcast Cross Zone with two guys from Game Buoy, two guys from Koopa Club, and one guy from Game Bar.
519000	525000	And we're going to just be talking about podcasting, and it'll be great. Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
525000	532000	I wonder, is there going to be any live stream happening at GamerX? Probably, but not by us. We have no plans to do any live streaming.
533000	541000	I don't like to live stream from cons because hotel Wi-Fi is really unreliable when there's so many people on it.
541000	548000	I believe either the Koopa Club guys or the Game Buoy guys are going to be putting some of that panel in their show.
548000	555000	I know it's being recorded. I don't think we'll use it on OLR, but I will certainly point you in the direction of those recordings when they're posted.
555000	562000	And whatever else comes from it. Stay tuned on Twitter. You can follow me on Twitter. Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E Sky.
562000	567000	And I'll be posting lots of tweets from the weekend. So I'm looking forward to it.
568000	571000	And hopefully no time on all PMs next weekend, so that'll be good.
573000	577000	All right. I don't know what else to talk about here at the top of the show. Does anybody else have a kickoff topic?
577000	580000	According to Loki, I'm crocheting a rainbow penis cozy.
580000	587000	She showed me something that looked like, you know, a little, almost like a mitt for a finger or something like that. I'm like, oh.
587000	588000	Middle finger cozy.
588000	590000	There's a picture on my Tumblr.
590000	592000	Oh, there you are. All right. Where's your Tumblr again for those who don't know?
592000	596000	Kurotsubasa. K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.
596000	597000	All right.
597000	599000	What's recognized by FemShep?
599000	601000	No, that's mass affecting.
601000	603000	Oh. Eh, whatever. It's okay.
603000	606000	Hey, my blogs are cool.
606000	611000	All right. I guess we will get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.
611000	613000	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
613000	618000	I haven't touched Mass Effect again for a week. I know. I know.
618000	626000	I'm playing Animal Crossing. I'm playing a lot of Animal Crossing because I'm trying, since I'm starting work next week, I'm actually trying to save up a lot of money.
626000	629000	You have substituted one crack for another.
629000	630000	No, I'm gonna be-
630000	633000	You've taken crack from Peru and substituted it for crack from Bolivia.
633000	636000	You just won crack for another.
636000	647000	No, but I'm gonna be going back to- I'm gonna be changing my livestream night once I'm out of training because I will be working on Thursdays.
647000	658000	So, my streaming will probably be earlier in the day. Probably, I have to make sure it's pre some show or something like that.
659000	667000	Speaking of livestreaming, Bobby wanted me to throw a plug out here and this will be fun. He will be livestreaming Saints Row 4 on August 14th is the day he's gonna do that.
667000	668000	That'll be exciting.
668000	669000	I believe it's a Wednesday.
669000	677000	So, yeah. Well, I'm probably gonna finish my Mass Effect 3 stream just because I've beaten that game 27,000 times.
677000	681000	Actually, no, I think I'm on my 20th playthrough. So, anyway.
681000	686000	So, yeah. I will be finishing up with that if I can keep it from lagging from the high res graphics that I plugged in.
686000	691000	I don't know why it's doing it. My computer is more than capable of handling it, so.
691000	699000	And then I'll be announcing that when that starts back up on masseffecting.tumblr.com. Plug plug.
699000	704000	And in the interim, I am actually making stuff for video games.
704000	712000	I am going to be making little slip pockets for a 3DS. I will be making them in XL size.
712000	719000	And as soon as I have everything set up, I will be doing, I think my first batch is gonna be in Tetris fabric.
719000	722000	So, if anyone's interested, talk to me.
722000	723000	Fun.
723000	726000	Yep. But, yeah. Animal Crossing. And pinball.
726000	728000	What kind of pinball? What games?
728000	730000	The stuff in my house.
730000	732000	You need some pinball games for your 3DS.
732000	738000	I need some other games for my 3DS. Well, we borrowed Fire Emblem from George.
738000	742000	But Dan wanted to play the previous Fire Emblem first, so he went and bought that.
742000	750000	There is another game going on in my house, and that is Phantasy Star Generation 1. The Sega Ages 1.
750000	758000	So, basically I have been replacing all of the music in Animal Crossing for the updated Phantasy Star.
758000	767000	So, everything sounds like combat from Phantasy Star in Animal Crossing. It's been very, very weird.
767000	771000	Alright. Let's move on then. Loki, how was your gaming week?
771000	776000	Didn't play a whole ton this week. Just a little bit of Borderlands 2.
776000	779000	It was a few hours. I got all my cards in one sitting.
780000	789000	So, I played up through level 9, and I just got the Sanctuary.
789000	794000	So, that's my fourth time playing through this game, I swear.
794000	798000	Because I played through it on console. I played through it on the Xbox three times.
798000	801000	So, it's like, ooh, I've already done this before.
801000	807000	But, yeah, I'll do that. Yeah, I totally hacked the crap out of the game.
807000	813000	It's what I do. It's my easy mode.
813000	817000	Your hacking your games is like me modifying my Mass Effect.
817000	827000	I do it all the time. What else? I think I did play Super Meat Boy a little bit this week as well.
828000	835000	I think that's it, though. I have Shadowrun Returns, because they finally sent me the code from Kickstarting that.
835000	841000	So, I did get to download that. I haven't played it yet, although it looks fun.
841000	846000	In Video Game High School, Season 2, Episode 1 came out this week.
846000	852000	It was fantastic and long, because now they're all 30 minute long episodes instead of 5 minute episodes.
852000	857000	It was between 6 and 15 minute episodes last season.
857000	864000	It looks interesting. It's cool. I didn't get a chance to download their high frame rate version yet.
864000	871000	But, the trailer was kind of neat, how they have 48 frames per second for the video game stuff and then 24 for everything else.
871000	875000	But, it's entertaining. And they've had a lot of cameos in there.
875000	882000	There's already been a Stan Lee cameo and a Cliffy B cameo already in there.
882000	885000	Oh, so that's what that guy's been up to.
885000	892000	Yeah, he was a judge for something. It was cool.
892000	899000	Alright, well my gaming week. Quite a bit of it's been documented on my livestream channel at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.
899000	906000	Right after the show last week, I checked out Rogue Legacy because I said I was going to do that because it was the last thing I wanted to pick up on the Steam sale.
906000	911000	So, I did pick that up and I was really impressed with that game.
911000	914000	I played it for about an hour, an hour and a half on the thing.
914000	918000	And then I played it again later in the week and it's a lot of fun.
918000	925000	It's kind of like one of those Metroidvania type of games, but the castle each time you play is randomly generated.
925000	929000	And when I say each time you play, I mean each time you die and you come back as somebody else.
929000	939000	Because that's the whole trick in Rogue Legacy is that you revive as the descendant of the last hero that you played as who will have some very different and unique traits.
939000	944000	Such as they might be more of a paladin who has a shield.
944000	946000	Or they might be somebody who's a giant.
946000	953000	Or they might be somebody who has turrets so they just randomly have a little cupid's swear cloud that comes up.
953000	957000	Or somebody who has, they start to do some interesting and a little bit controversial ones.
957000	963000	They have one with dyslexia where all the letters when people talk will get switched around like randomly.
963000	968000	And the vertigo one was a pain in the ass. That's where the entire thing is flipped.
968000	972000	So like you're walking on the ceiling and all that. Oh my gosh, that thing ticked me off.
972000	978000	But yeah, a lot of fun because you collect as much gold as you can when you go to the castle.
978000	982000	And you can buy power-ups that all the future people will get to use.
982000	987000	But in order to go back in the castle, you have to give up all your gold on hand.
987000	993000	So it really is about get as much gold as you can, make the next hero a little stronger so he can get further, he or she.
993000	997000	Get as much as you can, make the next hero stronger and so on and so on.
997000	1003000	And each time it's random. Although at one point you can hire somebody, like I think it's an architect they call it.
1003000	1010000	And the architect will allow you to keep the same castle as the last generation but you'll only get 40% of the gold.
1010000	1018000	So it's really a brilliant little trick in the game. I really liked it a lot.
1018000	1022000	I was going to say, you'd be a lot better at the vertigo levels if you played more Strider.
1022000	1026000	Or if I turned my monitor upside down when those came up.
1026000	1029000	Or played a lot more VVVVVV.
1029000	1034000	Yeah, right. Or just don't pick those guys moving forward, which is my plan.
1034000	1039000	Because you get to pick from which one of three descendants do you want to play as.
1039000	1044000	And so no more. I did the vertigo one for the LOL on the feed when I was broadcasting.
1044000	1048000	But no more of those. It's kind of one of those. You do it once for the laughs and then that's it.
1048000	1050000	So that was Rogue Legacy.
1050000	1056000	Bobby and I finally had our much advertised and talked about Borderlands Noob Night on Tuesday.
1056000	1059000	Yeah, I missed that. Like I didn't read my tweets.
1059000	1062000	Yeah, we tagged you in it just to see if you were going to drop in.
1062000	1068000	And we actually played from the start of the game to about level 7-ish.
1068000	1071000	So I think we were in like chapter 3 or something by the time we stopped.
1071000	1074000	I mean, you know, we played a pretty good chunk of the game.
1074000	1076000	So did you finish Captain Flint or did you...
1076000	1078000	Yes, I think that was the last guy we killed.
1078000	1081000	And then we got on a boat and we were taken somewhere else.
1081000	1083000	Okay, so you're chapter 4 then.
1083000	1085000	Oh, was it really? Wow.
1085000	1087000	The first few chapters are fast.
1087000	1091000	Yeah, but I mean the only downside to it is because we were both playing,
1091000	1094000	I think the tutorials were ping-ponging between us.
1094000	1096000	Because Bobby would be like, oh, just hit this key to do this.
1096000	1098000	Didn't the game tell you that? It'd be like, no.
1098000	1100000	And then there'd be something he didn't know because the game showed me.
1100000	1102000	So it was kind of a little weird.
1102000	1104000	So I would really recommend if you're going to play Borderlands 2,
1104000	1106000	don't do co-op right out the gate.
1106000	1109000	But it was fun. I mean, we had a good time.
1109000	1112000	And I think we entertained the folks that were watching us broadcasting on Twitch.
1112000	1116000	But, you know, I'm really bad at first-person shooters.
1116000	1121000	But the cool thing about Borderlands 2 is that the character I was playing had a little,
1121000	1125000	once you got to level 5, you got a little gun turret that you can place on the ground
1125000	1127000	and it'll automatically shoot people. So that was cool.
1127000	1132000	And Bobby was playing the Meckromancer, who is the, that was the controversial,
1132000	1134000	I'm using my quote-e-fingers, girlfriend mode.
1134000	1137000	But in reality it's supposed to be best friends forever mode.
1137000	1141000	I think we were calling it here at VoG Black Wolf Fun Forever mode.
1141000	1145000	Because that's the one where the bullets that miss will bounce off walls
1145000	1148000	and hit anyway for part of the damage or something like that.
1148000	1152000	So I wanted to play as the Meckromancer because I'm terrible at first-person shooters, right?
1153000	1160000	Now, when Borderlands 2 was on sale on Steam, I was gifted a copy of Borderlands 2
1160000	1164000	by a great listener, and I picked up the season pass myself.
1164000	1168000	Because I'm like, alright, well, I know I'm going to want to do all the DLC
1168000	1171000	and all the other stuff that's out right now, so I'm just going to pick up the season pass
1171000	1173000	and then that way I'll have it when I want to play.
1173000	1176000	Well, when I go in to play the game again, the second time, later in the week,
1176000	1178000	I went back in the game, I'm like, I'm going to try this again,
1178000	1180000	but this time I'm going to do the Meckromancer.
1180000	1184000	It's locked. And I'm like, wait a minute, I should have this because I bought the season pass.
1184000	1189000	And I do some research, and I'm like, wait a minute, the season pass is showing on my account, what's going on?
1189000	1193000	The characters aren't included in the season pass.
1193000	1194000	She was a pre-order bonus.
1194000	1198000	See, and that's the line I've been getting from a lot of people.
1198000	1202000	Yes, okay, she was a pre-order bonus, but they're still selling her.
1202000	1206000	Here's the thing, and not everybody's going to agree with me, and that's fine,
1206000	1208000	but we all get opinions, so take it or leave it.
1208000	1213000	I kind of think when they're selling this as a season pass, and they're leaving parts out,
1213000	1215000	that's a little bit disingenuous to me.
1215000	1220000	And you may argue with me on that, and that's fine, but to me, it's like picking up, like,
1220000	1226000	you know, when you get a season pass, like when I pick up Lost Season 7 on DVD,
1226000	1228000	Episode 4 is suddenly missing.
1228000	1231000	Oh, well, Episode 4 was a pre-order bonus only.
1233000	1235000	Not how it works, yo.
1235000	1240000	So I think it's more appropriately titled as a, it's a bundle.
1240000	1243000	That's what you're selling. You're selling a DLC bundle.
1243000	1248000	Well, yeah, like, we haven't gotten into it yet, but for Saints Pro 4, it's like,
1248000	1251000	come on, the amount of content that you include in your season pass,
1251000	1255000	I mean, granted, the price is really low on it, it's not a season pass.
1255000	1256000	It's just a bundle.
1256000	1262000	It was like for Mass Effect 2, the Cerberus pass thing, or the whole, it was a big Cerberus network pass.
1262000	1264000	It gave you a bunch of stuff, but it didn't give you all the DLC.
1264000	1267000	Right, but they didn't market it as something that, like, you know,
1267000	1270000	a season pass, I think, implies a particular thing.
1270000	1272000	And maybe this is just a terminology thing in our industry,
1272000	1278000	and we've been here before with the whole download content that's actually on a disc,
1278000	1280000	and I think we were all sitting here on the show saying,
1280000	1284000	that is not DLC, that is Pay to Unlock content, that is what it is.
1284000	1289000	And what I'm saying is that the Borderlands 2 season pass is not a season pass,
1289000	1292000	it is a DLC bundle, that is what it is.
1292000	1295000	You can disagree with me if you want, that's fine, that's my opinion.
1295000	1298000	It's not a season pass, it's missing some episodes.
1298000	1299000	Sensible.
1299000	1306000	So, anyhow, overall, that doesn't reflect on my opinion of the game,
1306000	1311000	I still think it's a fine game, and I think even if you don't like first person shooters,
1311000	1314000	I think it's just got a really, you know, it's got a neat story,
1314000	1318000	and it's got some cool mechanics that are reminiscent of like an MMO and so forth.
1318000	1319000	It's very diabolous.
1319000	1322000	And co-op mode is a lot of fun, I will say that.
1322000	1326000	But, you know, that was just my one little thing that did irk me a little bit.
1326000	1329000	Did you find yourself comparing guns a lot?
1329000	1331000	You know, like going, ooh, ooh.
1331000	1333000	Do you have the passive aggressive gun?
1333000	1335000	No, not yet, I don't think.
1335000	1338000	You know, if you had been a better shot, you wouldn't have been wasting bullets.
1338000	1339000	Those cost money, you know.
1339000	1345000	It was tough in co-op because what I'm used to in Diablo is that everybody gets their own loot.
1345000	1349000	That doesn't happen in Borderlands, so if Bobby picks up all the ammo, I'm stuck.
1349000	1353000	Uh, not exactly. It will pool ammo, I think.
1353000	1355000	Oh, will it? I knew it pooled money.
1355000	1358000	Yeah, it will pool ammo, yeah.
1358000	1359000	Oh, okay, my bad.
1359000	1361000	Here's the question I have to ask about this.
1361000	1365000	I've got Borderlands 2 now, I actually have the first one because I got it for free back in the day.
1365000	1369000	Do I have any benefit to finishing the first one before starting the second?
1369000	1372000	No benefit from finishing, well, a story, I guess.
1372000	1378000	You get to learn a little bit more of the backstory of different characters because they do end up in the game as NPCs,
1378000	1381000	so you know who this person is when you go and see him.
1381000	1386000	Aside from that, the only other bonus you get is you get some unlockable skins when you play the first game.
1386000	1392000	But you have to have a save file for the first game, so just play for five minutes to get a save file going and then play Borderlands 2.
1392000	1396000	Because, I mean, I watched Dan play the first one, you know, and I got so motion sick.
1396000	1401000	But I'm planning on playing through Borderlands 2 and calling it a bar fest when I stream it.
1401000	1402000	Good times.
1402000	1403000	I plan on streaming it.
1403000	1406000	They have a third person mode that you can unlock via a hack.
1406000	1408000	That's okay.
1408000	1413000	Games that are intended to be first person don't usually play as well third person.
1413000	1418000	So, I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
1418000	1424000	Dungeon Buster says, it would have been nice if the season pass weren't limited to only for the four DLC campaigns,
1424000	1428000	but would allow you to pick which four DLC you would want for the entire season.
1428000	1429000	I kind of like that.
1429000	1434000	I mean, again, I don't think season pass is the name for that, but I really like the idea of pick them and choose them.
1434000	1436000	And here's the thing.
1436000	1442000	I would have bought the Mechromancer separately in addition to the season pass if I'd known.
1442000	1449000	And I will take some accountability for not reading thoroughly as I should have, but it's just kind of like a certain thing is sort of implied by that.
1449000	1454000	No, I was with you because I was looking at the Mechromancer thing and I saw that it was separate too.
1454000	1461000	It wasn't actually that that I noticed. I was going through some skins because I modded it to unlock all the skins.
1461000	1464000	And so I was going through the skins and like, oh, I want to wear that one.
1464000	1466000	And it like popped me to the Steam store.
1466000	1470000	I'm like, why does it show me stuff that's in there that I don't have?
1470000	1472000	Oh, you want me to buy it?
1472000	1473000	No, I'm not going to buy it.
1473000	1475000	Dangling the carrot in front of you.
1475000	1476000	But again, all that other.
1476000	1478000	That's what SDO does, by the way.
1478000	1479000	All that other junk.
1479000	1482000	Well, SDO is a free to play game too, so you cut it some different.
1482000	1485000	But for paid outfits, it gives you the option of setting up that outfit.
1485000	1490000	And then when you load the outfit on your character, when you're making them, it says this is pay XX amount.
1490000	1491000	Gotcha.
1491000	1497000	Well, speaking of free to play, the other game I've been playing this week, and I really can't explain how this happened,
1497000	1504000	but I've sunk in about five, six hours in Dota 2, Defense of the Ancients 2, which is a free game.
1504000	1506000	I know there's probably like some people out there going, what?
1506000	1509000	But it's a free game on Steam.
1509000	1513000	It was in beta for the longest time, and it just officially launched a couple weeks ago.
1513000	1518000	And it is very similar to another game called League of Legends, which I'm sure many of you have heard about.
1518000	1525000	And the reason why these two games are so similar is because both of them have influence from the original mod
1525000	1528000	called Defense of the Ancients that was in Warcraft 3.
1528000	1534000	It was an insanely popular mod to the game, just like Team Fortress was a popular mod to Quake, and so on.
1534000	1537000	You know, sometimes mods become their own little thing.
1537000	1540000	So Defense of the Ancients became its own game, essentially.
1540000	1546000	So Valve has the Dota 2, there's League of Legends, and there's all these other games that are inspired by it too.
1546000	1548000	Blizzard's going to have their own thing.
1548000	1550000	All Stars, I think is what it's called.
1550000	1554000	There's Heroes of New Earth, and there's more and more of these showing up.
1554000	1562000	I really can't tell you why I chose to play Dota 2, especially because of Hoard House, my other show.
1562000	1564000	There's been a lot of talk about League of Legends.
1565000	1569000	But I feel like, or I felt like for the longest time, I'm like, I don't get League of Legends.
1569000	1575000	It has a tutorial mode, but it doesn't help me understand how to get good at this game or whatever.
1575000	1578000	Here's the thing with Dota 2.
1578000	1583000	So I think what happened is I was looking around the community marketplace, and I was looking at the trading cards,
1583000	1588000	the value of cards, and I was looking at some of the stuff that was in Dota 2, that was up there on the marketplace.
1588000	1593000	And I decided to just launch the game, because apparently I had some stuff from Dota 2
1593000	1597000	for just being in the beta, so I just wanted to launch the game and see what it was all about.
1597000	1601000	And I noticed right away, when I launched the game, the launcher looked different than it did before.
1601000	1606000	I was like, oh, this is laid out all differently, and it threw me right into this tutorial mode.
1606000	1608000	Do you want to learn how to start playing the game?
1608000	1610000	So I said, alright, whatever, I'm going to sit here.
1610000	1613000	I didn't get it when I played League of Legends, but maybe I'll get it this time.
1613000	1619000	So I started to play, I played the first tutorial, I played the second tutorial, and I kept playing.
1619000	1623000	And here I was, I was actually learning how to play Dota 2.
1623000	1627000	And all these things that I'm sure if you're a League of Legends player sitting out there listening,
1627000	1629000	you're probably going, duh Rob.
1629000	1635000	I didn't really get like, oh, so the point is not to just go out there and attack as fast as you can.
1635000	1641000	You actually have to time your hits, you have to be kind of walking with your little NPCs,
1641000	1646000	they're kind of your meat shields, you hang back, and there's always this game of chicken going on.
1646000	1650000	You don't necessarily engage other heroes directly, you have to wait for the opportunity moment to strike.
1650000	1656000	Like, all of this is finally hitting me the way the Dota 2's thing was built.
1656000	1658000	Like, it's tutorial mode is great.
1658000	1662000	And then it takes you from that to, okay, now you're going to play a map,
1662000	1664000	and all you're going to do, you're going to take out one tower.
1664000	1668000	And then it says, okay, now this time you're going to do a middle lane fight.
1668000	1671000	The only lane that's available is the middle lane, and it's a 1v1 map.
1671000	1674000	And you just kind of learn and learn and learn that way.
1674000	1682000	And right now I'm on the part of it where I'm playing an entire match against bots, but with limited heroes selection.
1682000	1685000	So I've been learning how to play the game, and it's fun.
1685000	1687000	But it's still an RTS, right?
1687000	1691000	It's what they call a MOBA. It's kind of a new genre of game.
1691000	1694000	It's a multiplayer online battle arena.
1694000	1695000	Eh.
1695000	1699000	It's different. I can't really say it's like an RTS.
1699000	1701000	Because RTS games just make me hurt.
1701000	1705000	Well, imagine an RTS mixed with World of Warcraft.
1705000	1709000	It's, I mean, that's really a crude way of putting it, but it's the best I can do.
1709000	1712000	Yeah, I don't know that, I still don't know that I would like it.
1712000	1714000	Because, I mean, I've been thinking about it, and I've seen people play it.
1714000	1717000	But I hate real-time strategies, and it's not because I'm not good at them.
1717000	1721000	I'm really good at them. I just think that they're very boring.
1721000	1723000	Well, I would honestly recommend Dota 2.
1723000	1729000	Just get in there and play the tutorial mode, because you don't really play against other people until towards the end of it, if you want.
1729000	1732000	And the nice thing about Dota 2 is if you want to play an all-bot match, you can.
1732000	1736000	But here's the interesting thing. Now that I've done this, now I want to go back and play League of Legends again.
1736000	1738000	Because I feel like, okay, now I get it.
1738000	1742000	And everybody tells me League of Legends is kind of easier to wrap your head around than Dota.
1742000	1747000	Because I guess there is still a lot of stuff beyond the tutorials and Dota that I haven't really experienced yet.
1747000	1751000	But I want to go back and play League of Legends, and, you know, you can do bot matches there and everything.
1751000	1755000	So, the only negatives I ever hear about these games is the community.
1755000	1758000	That the communities in these games are really awful.
1758000	1762000	But, you know, the makers of the games, to their credits, are taking strides to try and combat that.
1762000	1769000	There's a big old blog post on the Dota 2 forums, and League of Legends, I know, has their whole community tribal councils.
1769000	1771000	I think we were calling it on Horde House, and so forth.
1771000	1773000	So, you know, they're trying.
1773000	1779000	But, yeah, so this week I want to go back and play League of Legends and see if I get it this time.
1781000	1782000	I'll give it a, okay, how about this?
1782000	1789000	How about at some point this week, if I'm not completely fried with my new job, I will give it a try.
1789000	1792000	And I will report on it by the next show.
1792000	1793000	Sounds good.
1793000	1797000	Alright, technus in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
1797000	1801000	If you really get into Dota 2 League of Legends, you would actually find that they do play differently.
1801000	1803000	Yeah, I don't doubt that technus.
1803000	1805000	I read some of the comparison articles online.
1805000	1810000	I've heard a lot about the timing and, you know, things that they do play differently in that regard.
1810000	1813000	And, you know, just the way they're laid out and so forth.
1813000	1816000	So, you know, we'll see.
1816000	1822000	Technus says, I felt that League of Legends had a better hand-holding tutorial, but I haven't touched Dota 2 past beta.
1822000	1825000	I think that tutorial went in when it launched.
1825000	1826000	So that's the thing.
1826000	1830000	And, yeah, Kossin in our chat room, I hope I said that right, says,
1830000	1833000	Dota has tutorials now? Yes, it does.
1833000	1836000	So, you know, if you're curious about it, why not? Check it out.
1836000	1840000	So, yeah, I guess that was really my gaming week in a nutshell.
1840000	1842000	So, some quick housekeeping.
1842000	1847000	Don't forget to visit our website, orangelaunchradio.com, and our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
1847000	1850000	And Facebook, facebook.com slash orangelaunchradio.
1850000	1851000	I apologize.
1851000	1856000	There was no foogle question of the week this week, so we won't be able to do that segment in part B.
1856000	1860000	That is my bad and just the insanity, crazy weekend I had.
1860000	1863000	I literally threw this show together about an hour before we went live tonight.
1863000	1865000	So, yeah, we cut some corners.
1865000	1866000	I just thought of a question.
1866000	1867000	Did you? Yeah.
1867000	1870000	Well, we can ask it in two weeks when we come back.
1870000	1872000	Well, it won't be relevant then, but it's okay.
1872000	1873000	Don't. What were you gonna ask?
1873000	1875000	Well, I'll bring it up with my story. How about that?
1875000	1877000	Okay, there you go. I was gonna say, ask the chatters.
1877000	1879000	You know, you can get some immediate feedback there.
1879000	1882000	Yeah, I'll ask the chatters and then we'll, yeah.
1882000	1885000	All right, there you go. Maybe some emails. Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
1885000	1887000	All right, let's get into the news tonight. Loki.
1887000	1892000	All right, as the next continuing chapter of the 180 saga,
1893000	1897000	Microsoft has now confirmed that despite what they said earlier,
1897000	1904000	they made it a small error and, yes, there will actually be self-publishing now for the Xbox One.
1904000	1911000	And it's kind of funny. It was supposed to be an announcement at Gamescom
1911000	1918000	and then somehow got leaked out by Game Informer and here we are.
1918000	1920000	So basically, their quote is,
1920000	1926000	Our vision is that every person can be a creator, that every Xbox One can be used for development,
1926000	1932000	that every game and experience can take advantage of all the features of the Xbox One and Xbox Live.
1932000	1936000	This means self-publishing. This means Kinect, the cloud, achievements.
1936000	1939000	This means great discoverability on Xbox Live.
1939000	1944000	We'll have more details in the program and a timeline at Gamescom in August.
1944000	1953000	I'm confused. First off, it's good news, but once again, anything that has to do with Microsoft
1953000	1957000	or even just anything that has to do with a lot of these console launches
1957000	1962000	where you're going to see a lot of those asterisks and a lot of fine print and stuff,
1962000	1968000	we don't know all the details yet of what the self-publishing is going to require, what you can do.
1968000	1974000	It sounds cool that we can use any of the retail consoles as a dev unit.
1974000	1980000	I mean, that's kind of cool, but we don't know yet what the requirements are going to be
1980000	1982000	as far as submitting something in there.
1982000	1986000	Are you going to have to go through a review process? Is it going to be like XNA was?
1986000	1990000	Don't really know, but it sounds interesting.
1990000	1994000	They're trying to, I think, cover some ground to get some of those indies back
1994000	2000000	after they've had such a bad reputation with how they treat indie developers and stuff,
2000000	2004000	especially on the Xbox 360 and continuing that to the Xbox One.
2004000	2007000	Do you mean by cover ground, cover their ass?
2007000	2012000	Yeah, to help make up ground that they lost.
2012000	2017000	Also, there's a rumor that this might not just pertain to the Xbox One,
2017000	2027000	that apparently the developer Farsight Studios, who's done some work on the Pinball Arcade,
2027000	2032000	said that Microsoft has just announced that indie developers like them
2032000	2038000	can now publish on Xbox Live Arcade instead of being required to find a publisher for their games.
2038000	2042000	This means we can bring the Pinball Arcade back to the 360 ourselves
2042000	2046000	and open the door to the Xbox One version of the Pinball Arcade in the future.
2046000	2051000	So, it sounds like this may also apply to the Xbox 360 as well.
2051000	2055000	Yeah, technically you have to file that in the rumor bin, but when it's coming out like this,
2055000	2058000	it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, oh, they probably got told something.
2058000	2062000	Because that game was a pretty big deal, and it sucks that it disappeared.
2062000	2066000	So, it's no wonder. I bet Microsoft themselves kind of wants to get that game back.
2066000	2072000	So, this is interesting with how they're going to do this, but at the same time,
2072000	2079000	I mean, I don't know, this is almost like, well, now that this isn't really exclusive to the Xbox One,
2079000	2082000	you're kind of competing with yourself again, you know?
2082000	2085000	It's just like, all these great games are coming out on the Xbox 360.
2085000	2089000	Why do I need to spend $500 to get an Xbox One that has pretty much the same games?
2089000	2093000	They look slightly better. I don't know.
2093000	2097000	Well, Microsoft doesn't exactly lose by selling more 360s.
2097000	2100000	That's true. No, I don't think that they lose.
2100000	2106000	But their strategy, and this is from the horse's mouth actually, is that they're going to have so many SKUs,
2106000	2111000	and it's a four or five SKUs strategy is basically what it is.
2111000	2117000	They have a four gig system. They have a four gig system with Kinect, a 250 gig system.
2117000	2122000	They got rid of the 250 gig system with Kinect because that was competing with the Xbox One.
2122000	2125000	They figured that the people that are going to be buying that are going to be buying the Xbox One.
2125000	2128000	So then you have the Xbox One, and then whatever holiday bundle it is.
2128000	2132000	That's their strategy going in, and I think that's going to be going forward is how they're going to do it.
2132000	2138000	They're going to have four or five SKUs, depending on whether there's a holiday bundle available, or a bundle of some sort.
2138000	2142000	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
2142000	2146000	Just seems very vague. I expect this won't be ready day one.
2146000	2150000	I think a lot of this they're just trying to save because they're talking at Gamescom.
2150000	2154000	They don't want to just like, yeah, you guys already heard all this information. Let's just repeat it again.
2154000	2160000	But I think it's kind of lame that they're doing that because people want to know.
2160000	2165000	Developers want to know what the details are so they can consider making their games for your platform,
2165000	2171000	and yet you're just like, but we really want to talk about it at Gamescom, so we're just going to wait.
2171000	2175000	You're going to just have to wait and see. I mean, that's kind of dumb.
2175000	2181000	Tell the developers. Yeah, the developers will leak it out. Put them under NDA or something. I don't know.
2181000	2186000	Akuma JP in our chatroom says, Sounds like Microsoft is suffering from multiple personality disorder.
2186000	2194000	Well, they did. To be fair, they did take a beating at E3, and they went through a major management change just in the past month.
2194000	2199000	So the fact that some of these things are starting to come out isn't that surprising.
2199000	2203000	It's just like, how fast can it really happen? I think it's all good news.
2203000	2206000	It'll be interesting. It's good news at the end of the day. Yeah.
2206000	2211000	It'll be interesting to see how it's going to work as far as like, are we going to see, you know,
2211000	2217000	are we going to see the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace turned into kind of like what Xbox Indie Games is?
2217000	2223000	I hope not, because that's going to be really difficult to find stuff with everybody publishing titles.
2223000	2227000	Well, especially since, you know, one of the big words they used was deliverability.
2227000	2231000	I mean, they have to make it easy to access to make it deliverable.
2231000	2234000	I think a lot of it, too, is it would really help them out.
2234000	2240000	I would think it's going to look more like iTunes, because iTunes, you know, is this self-publishing central.
2240000	2244000	I'll tell you what this really is. It's not about, you know, publishing on the Xbox One stuff,
2244000	2246000	although that's good and everything.
2246000	2251000	What it is is it's, the way they have it, the way you develop games on the,
2251000	2255000	it's not even really the, you know, Xbox Marketplace or whatever.
2255000	2259000	It's the Windows Store is basically what it is.
2259000	2266000	When you publish a game, it's available on, you know, for PC or Windows 8, Windows Phone,
2266000	2269000	and now the Microsoft, you know, Xbox One.
2269000	2272000	That's what it's going to be, is publishing on all three platforms.
2272000	2278000	And they're getting, they're trying to get to a point where you buy like Angry Birds on Windows 8,
2278000	2282000	now you have Angry Birds on your Xbox One and on your Windows Phone.
2282000	2284000	I think that's exactly where my mind's going.
2284000	2287000	That is key, because that's how iTunes works, if you think about it.
2287000	2292000	You can buy from your mobile device or your iPad, or you can buy on your desktop.
2292000	2296000	And then through the cloud, it all shows up on all your devices automatically.
2296000	2299000	And I really think that's how the game systems ought to work, Sony included.
2299000	2302000	Nintendo too, if they could ever get there.
2302000	2306000	Unless you buy the better version for your iPad that takes advantage of the iPad's resolution.
2306000	2310000	But from what I heard from them, they're a long way away from that.
2310000	2316000	Like, they may be promising something like that right now, but 2015 at the earliest, this is going to happen.
2316000	2319000	So it's a long way off.
2319000	2324000	We had discussions with Microsoft, the Microsoft reps about this kind of stuff, because that was my thought,
2324000	2326000	and they were like, yeah, you're right.
2326000	2333000	It's interesting, but I think it's just, and I'm kind of hesitant at the same time as like,
2333000	2338000	okay, you can develop games for Xbox One, are they really going to be Xbox One games,
2338000	2345000	or are they going to be these Windows games running on that Windows OS portion of the Xbox 360
2345000	2351000	that just happened to be, or I'm sorry, Xbox One, that just happened to be part of the Xbox One.
2351000	2357000	It's not actually a true native Xbox One game, you know what I mean?
2357000	2360000	All right, well, it's going to be interesting to see what develops,
2360000	2365000	and also kind of how the Microsoft Sony dance continues with this.
2365000	2369000	So, I mean, obviously Microsoft's doing this in some way to catch up to Sony,
2369000	2373000	and their reaction they got at E3,
2373000	2377000	so it'll be interesting to see what Sony might do to kind of one-up that.
2377000	2380000	But anyway, let's talk about a big budget game,
2380000	2384000	and a game that a lot of folks are excited about over on Nintendo's platform,
2384000	2387000	Smash Brothers, Super Smash Brothers.
2387000	2392000	Now, a new story came out this week that Masahiro Sakurai said that in the story mode,
2392000	2397000	there will not be a subspace emissary storyline that was in Brawl.
2397000	2399000	There will be a single-player campaign, however.
2399000	2404000	But in Famitsu Magazine, he actually said that the story mode won't happen,
2404000	2407000	because cutscenes get uploaded on the internet.
2407000	2410000	Really weird excuse, but here's the quote for us to ponder.
2410000	2415000	Quote, unfortunately, the movie scenes we worked hard to create were uploaded onto the internet.
2415000	2419000	You can only truly wow a player the first time he sees a cutscene.
2419000	2422000	I felt if players saw the cutscenes outside of the game,
2422000	2425000	they would no longer service rewards for playing the game,
2425000	2428000	so I've decided against having them.
2428000	2431000	That's a very strange quote. Let's chew on that for a minute.
2431000	2435000	That's a quote from somebody who doesn't understand how the internet works.
2435000	2436000	Right.
2436000	2440000	You know, it's basically, I understand his point of view where,
2440000	2442000	you know, woo, that's a really cool video and stuff,
2442000	2445000	but, you know, that's like saying, once you've seen a movie,
2445000	2448000	like, if you see a movie trailer, you're not gonna want to see the movie,
2448000	2452000	because you saw scenes from the movie in the movie trailer.
2452000	2454000	Yeah, but with all the let's play and all of that,
2454000	2458000	you can see a heck of a lot more than a trailer of a game that's, you know, out there.
2458000	2459000	I understand that, but not...
2459000	2462000	And Nintendo's also taken a stance against let's play in the past,
2462000	2464000	even though they might have went back on it.
2464000	2466000	But people that are watching let's play videos
2466000	2469000	aren't necessarily gonna be the people that are gonna be spoiled by,
2469000	2473000	oh, I can't play this game anymore because I watched it being played through already.
2473000	2474000	It's not gonna be like that.
2474000	2478000	If anything, it's gonna get people excited because they see these awesome cutscenes.
2478000	2481000	They're like, whoa, I want to see, you know, more of this game.
2481000	2485000	But just instead of making excuses about YouTube
2485000	2488000	and, you know, saying that's why you did it, just be honest.
2488000	2490000	We want to get this game out right away.
2490000	2492000	This is a feature that not a lot of people utilize,
2492000	2494000	so we're gonna focus on the multiplayer
2494000	2496000	and make that the best part of the game
2496000	2498000	because that's what people want to play when they play Smash.
2498000	2502000	Just come out and say that instead of being a dick about it and saying,
2502000	2507000	hey, yeah, it's because those people upload our videos on YouTube.
2507000	2510000	Come on, it's just ridiculous.
2510000	2512000	I'm with you there a little bit. I'm really with you there a little bit.
2512000	2515000	This does seem like a convenient excuse to get the game moving right along,
2515000	2518000	which is fine, but yeah, exactly the way you said it.
2518000	2521000	I think if he came out and said it that way, a lot of people would be like, yay.
2521000	2526000	Yeah, if something we tried, if Brawl, it was, you know, some people liked it.
2526000	2528000	Not a lot of people really, you know, played it.
2528000	2532000	So instead of focusing a lot of, instead of splitting our team, you know, down the middle
2532000	2537000	and, you know, focusing it all on, or half on the single player and half on the multiplayer,
2537000	2538000	we're just gonna focus on the multiplayer.
2538000	2540000	Hell, that's what they did for Titanfall.
2540000	2543000	And I still don't buy that excuse, by the way, for Titanfall either,
2543000	2547000	because honestly I do care about a single player campaign for, you know,
2547000	2551000	a first person shooter versus a single player campaign for a fighting game.
2551000	2556000	Right, right. So, there you go.
2556000	2565000	I hope that the game really kicks butt, but if the fighting element of the game is really, really good,
2565000	2568000	then I think people will forget about this in six months.
2568000	2571000	But there could have been a better way to deliver this news.
2571000	2573000	So, all right.
2573000	2577000	Speaking of other bad news, or don't care about this news, who knows.
2577000	2581000	Because I've heard from people that there's various minds going on about this.
2581000	2587000	But PolyTron put out an announcement that Fez 2 was cancelled, and Phil Fish says, yep, I'm done.
2587000	2597000	And this is going after some internet dramas of various bitch levels.
2597000	2599000	I'm just gonna go out and say it.
2599000	2603000	It's people being bitchy on the internet and people outbitching the other and outtrolling the other.
2603000	2606000	And actually, listen to Bobby's show.
2606000	2610000	Because he went off on it in a way that I 100% agree with.
2610000	2612000	It was ridiculous.
2612000	2614000	It's not a big surprise.
2614000	2616000	It's not a big surprise. It's something that he would do.
2616000	2620000	Because, you know, one of the things he was arguing about with the Annoyed Gamer thing was,
2620000	2623000	it's like, what kind of art have you put out?
2623000	2626000	It's almost like your stupid show or whatever is nothing.
2626000	2628000	I've created art with Fez.
2628000	2631000	It's like, dude, you've put out one indie game.
2631000	2634000	You're not fucking God, okay?
2634000	2636000	It's just, it's a game.
2636000	2638000	Yeah, it was great. People liked it. Cool.
2638000	2641000	But you're not like, just get off your high horse.
2641000	2643000	One damn game, man.
2643000	2645000	One game.
2645000	2647000	This, to me, looks like an internet meltdown.
2647000	2650000	Yeah. That's kind of one of those things that Twitter does.
2650000	2654000	I mean, look at, one of my favorite comparisons I've heard out there on the internet is that Phil Fe,
2654000	2656000	and to be fair, I really don't know this guy.
2656000	2658000	I played Fez a couple times. It's fine.
2658000	2660000	But I really just don't care.
2660000	2663000	I haven't seen that indie game movie. I'll sit down and watch it at one of these points.
2663000	2665000	You know, but I just, it's a movie.
2665000	2668000	And, you know, reality shows distort people all the time.
2668000	2670000	You always take that stuff with a grain of salt.
2670000	2676000	But this really just seems like a big pomp and circumstance about something that doesn't,
2676000	2678000	like, it's just, this whole thing's like a waste of time.
2678000	2679000	You know?
2679000	2680000	And in the end?
2680000	2685000	Oh, sorry. My favorite comparison I heard out there on the internet was that Phil Fish is the Amanda Bynes of gaming.
2685000	2687000	Okay.
2687000	2690000	My whole thing with it is, is that, um,
2690000	2697000	if you find yourself close to a meltdown, and this is, what you need to do is take a step back,
2697000	2701000	go someplace safe where you have nothing to trigger you,
2701000	2707000	you know, watch some cartoons, you know, sit back and watch some Adventure Time,
2707000	2713000	open a couple beers, and play on Tumblr for a while, because Tumblr's sort of safe too.
2713000	2715000	You know, it happens to the best of us.
2715000	2717000	I had a diva fit here on OLR one night.
2717000	2719000	It was, it was an infamous moment that happened.
2719000	2721000	It was like five years ago at this point.
2721000	2723000	You scared the shit out of Shermie.
2723000	2725000	No, no, no. That wasn't at your place. That was at the studio.
2725000	2727000	You had one at my house.
2727000	2732000	I might've had a little one, but I had a big one when something like the wrong thing was said in the chat room.
2732000	2735000	And remember I left and I'm like, you know what?
2735000	2739000	If you don't like, I left, I just quit mid show.
2739000	2741000	I didn't quit the show, but I just said, you know what?
2741000	2743000	I'm going to go do something more fun than this right now.
2743000	2744000	Cause I'm not taking this right now.
2744000	2745000	No way.
2745000	2747000	I'm not making Fez 2.
2747000	2749000	You kind of, I kind of did have that diva moment.
2749000	2751000	So I can understand in that regard.
2751000	2755000	And I was just frustrated by a lot of things that were going on that night.
2755000	2759000	And then a chat room chat listener just really said something that got under my skin.
2759000	2764000	So in that regard, I can kind of sympathize, but at the same time, from what I do hear about this guy,
2764000	2768000	he does kind of make these very trolley generous or generalized comments.
2768000	2771000	Sometimes he kind of brings a little bit of it on himself.
2771000	2776000	So it's hard to feel a whole lot of pity for the guy, you know, but I kind of sit here and go,
2776000	2783000	you're going to take what this guy who calls himself, himself annoyed gamer says to get under your skin.
2783000	2787000	I mean, and again, I don't know this other guy either, this annoyed gamer or whatever,
2787000	2792000	but I kind of look at that name going, wow, you sound like everything that I hate about the games industry,
2792000	2794000	all in two little words right there.
2794000	2795000	Besides, I am the annoyed gamer.
2795000	2797000	Why don't you just call yourself cynical fuck?
2797000	2799000	You know, I'm just kind of like.
2799000	2802000	Besides that, the angry video game nerd did it better.
2802000	2803000	And that was parody.
2803000	2805000	Yeah. And he's actually hilarious.
2805000	2809000	So I and I think this other guy is kind of trying to be legit, but it does seem weird to me.
2809000	2815000	Again, if the whole thing boils down to that, you know, Phil Fish did not want to comment on this,
2815000	2821000	you know, Xbox thing that's going on, he should have just said no comment or no thank you,
2821000	2826000	as opposed to fuck you, you fucking fuck, which is, you know, not a direct quote,
2826000	2831000	but the sense of what I get happened in that paraphrase, paraphrasing a little bit.
2831000	2837000	You know, like I said, he needs to take a step back, go to a safe place,
2837000	2845000	maybe put on some old school Duran Duran, bop out a little bit to Hungry Like the Wolf,
2845000	2850000	and then maybe come back with a cooler head.
2852000	2855000	All right. And I'm checking the chat room ZZZ in our chat room says,
2855000	2858000	was the episode where Rob Ragequitted the show ever uploaded?
2858000	2860000	I only listened to the podcast at the time. I didn't get to hear it.
2860000	2866000	I think the whole thing happened over a video card error that happened,
2866000	2869000	because that's why the listeners pulled together and bought this new computer
2869000	2872000	that we broadcast the show from, and that happened after the diva moment.
2872000	2879000	So I think the video card like went out mid-show, and I actually lost the show up to that point,
2879000	2883000	and then when we recorded again, that comment was said, and I think the show got thrown out.
2883000	2886000	I don't think it was ever a podcast, to be honest.
2886000	2891000	I think it was captured because at the time we were streaming on Justin TV.
2891000	2895000	This was before Twitch existed. I think some of it lived on there,
2895000	2899000	but I think it's long gone. It's too old at this point.
2899000	2901000	Unless we had our bootlegger.
2901000	2903000	You really don't need to see it.
2903000	2905000	It wasn't pretty.
2905000	2908000	Don't try to capture one of my worst moments in radio.
2908000	2912000	That's the downside to it. I like to think I've done about...
2912000	2914000	Promise says it was on the feed, and actually it isn't.
2914000	2915000	Was it?
2915000	2916000	Yeah.
2916000	2917000	Oh, I don't remember.
2917000	2918000	They just don't remember which episode.
2918000	2921000	I don't either. It's for the bad. You know what?
2921000	2928000	One bad moment out of like 514 episodes, you know, why do you want to fixate on that one bad moment?
2928000	2930000	That's all I'm saying, is like, can't we...
2930000	2932000	Because that's what people do.
2932000	2933000	Yeah, I know.
2933000	2940000	I mean, maybe Lindsay Lohan was once a great actress, but people remember all the bad shit she's done.
2940000	2942000	What about all the good things Lindsay did?
2942000	2943000	It's just people are focusing...
2943000	2945000	Like going to rehab.
2945000	2950000	People are just focusing on everything because it's just a slow news week, honestly.
2950000	2955000	Like, I couldn't believe how many people were running, how many different outlets were running that story.
2955000	2957000	I was just like, are you kidding me? Come on.
2957000	2961000	Didn't the whole thing that Phil Fish blew up at...
2961000	2967000	Didn't the whole thing boil down to the fact that this media guy felt like he deserved a comment on the situation,
2967000	2972000	was calling out him and Jonathan Blow because they wouldn't comment on the Xbox situation?
2972000	2973000	I don't know.
2973000	2974000	Isn't that what it boiled down to?
2974000	2975000	Yeah.
2975000	2976000	I was like...
2976000	2978000	I was trying to provoke a reaction. Well, they got one.
2978000	2982000	I was at a three-year-old's birthday party and I look on the internet and all of a sudden...
2982000	2984000	Yeah, because I check Twitter just every now and then.
2984000	2985000	I mean, Lindsay...
2985000	2987000	You know what? Maybe I should make him a rainbow penis cozy.
2987000	2995000	You know what, annoyed gamer or whatever, you know, welcome to my world where we just get ignored.
2995000	2997000	How would you prefer that?
2997000	3001000	I know. I mean, I ignored by all the different media outlets.
3001000	3003000	Exactly. I'm like...
3003000	3005000	Except occasionally Namco.
3005000	3009000	You should be lucky you get any comments at all. Anyway.
3009000	3012000	Who are you? Who? Who are you?
3012000	3015000	Hey, I'm the annoyed gamer, okay?
3015000	3017000	I'm annoyed and I'm the gamer.
3017000	3021000	You are kind of the OG annoyed gamer guy.
3021000	3029000	But when we talk about Saints Row 4 or Grand Theft Auto, you suddenly become the hehehe gamer.
3029000	3032000	You know, therefore the tickled gamer when it comes to those games.
3032000	3034000	How about the bipolar gamer?
3034000	3037000	Well, I am a little annoyed that I'm not playing Saints Row 4 right now, so...
3037000	3040000	That is a little annoying, isn't it?
3040000	3043000	So what does that make me, the crafty gamer?
3043000	3046000	Hmm... I don't know.
3046000	3047000	Penis cozy?
3047000	3049000	Yeah, you're the rainbow penis cozy gamer.
3049000	3050000	Alright.
3050000	3052000	Maybe we should send him one. Maybe that would make him feel better.
3052000	3053000	Perhaps. I don't know.
3053000	3055000	Alright, oh yeah, real quick. There was a cotton...
3055000	3057000	It's 100% cotton. Feel it.
3057000	3059000	That's too hot. I can already tell.
3059000	3060000	I don't know.
3060000	3062000	Alright, let's move on with more news.
3062000	3076000	Alright, so, you know, to kind of keep along the theme of Microsoft fixing some of their hiccups in their, I don't know, game development process.
3076000	3078000	They're working on World of Tanks.
3078000	3084000	The developer is basically saying, you know, they're working with Microsoft to help streamline the process of certification.
3084000	3089000	Because certification takes quite a long time with Microsoft.
3089000	3098000	And because games like, you know, free-to-play World of Tanks needs some frequent updates to be able to push that through Microsoft,
3098000	3106000	it's very difficult to kind of get one of those games to work on the Xbox 360.
3106000	3118000	So right now they're working out, I guess, what they need to fix on Microsoft's end to kind of help alleviate some of that problem with the certification process.
3118000	3120000	So hopefully it'll get better.
3120000	3130000	Hopefully, you know, this, by the time we get to November, I'm assuming it's November when this console is going to launch, you know, that all this stuff will be ironed out.
3130000	3138000	You know, and everything with, you know, self-publishing and all that stuff, it'll be a lot easier to get your game on there and keep it updated.
3139000	3150000	It sounds like a lot of this crap that Microsoft's had to go through is really going to make them a better, you know, company when it comes to gaming with all these things that they've had to kind of change, one of them being the certification process.
3150000	3164000	Yeah, I wonder, like, I mean, I don't know if it's just a coincidence in timing or whatever, but, you know, the departure, you know, Don Mattrick there, if he was holding all this stuff back, I mean, it's like, hey, we're fixing a lot of problems, but I think it's just coincidence, you know.
3164000	3182000	You know the next thing they need to fix, and maybe this is a little bit pie-in-the-sky dreaming, but the whole, like, no cross-platform play issue, you know, because they let it go by with Final Fantasy XI, but they won't do it with Final Fantasy XIV, and I'm sure there's a host of other games that would like to, maybe Defiance or, you know, things that would like to be cross-platform.
3182000	3187000	Honestly, I would like the ability to be able to play my game system without Kinect being attached.
3187000	3200000	Not to say that, you know, you can't have Kinect features in your game, because obviously you can still program your game with, you know, Kinect features being in there, because you know every system is going to have a Kinect.
3200000	3212000	But say I don't want to play with the Kinect on there, it just disables those features instead of not working, you know, and if it is a Kinect-required game, sorry, this game requires Kinect, please plug in Kinect to play this game.
3213000	3222000	Why is that so hard? I don't understand, why is it so hard? Is it because the NSA doesn't want you not having that microphone and camera on there all the time?
3222000	3232000	Speaking of which, I just thought this was kind of funny, and ironic and totally off-topic, but my wife is watching the series Scandal, and they actually had an episode-
3232000	3235000	Yay, I told her she should watch that, she like it?
3235000	3242000	Yeah, she likes it, but here's the thing, on season two they actually had an episode where it was all of the same stuff that's going on right now.
3242000	3248000	They had like, this NSA had this device, you know, to be able to spy on everybody using webcams and stuff like that.
3248000	3250000	Dude, this is like way before all this stuff happened.
3250000	3252000	That's the whole arc of the second season, yeah I know, it's funny.
3252000	3254000	This is like so hilarious.
3254000	3260000	Scandal's a hella good show, huh? It's total trash, but it's like one of those shows where it's like,
3260000	3268000	sometimes you want to watch like a good show, you know like a good drama show, that's why people watch Game of Thrones or Orange is the New Black or something right?
3268000	3270000	I used to watch Matlock for that.
3270000	3272000	But sometimes you want to just watch like crap.
3272000	3274000	And like Scandal's a great show.
3274000	3280000	I don't think it's that bad, I mean it's not a terrible show, but yeah it's a little ridiculous in their plot.
3280000	3281000	Okay, okay.
3281000	3283000	I can't watch a show I have to turn off my brain for.
3283000	3293000	It's about like Loki, she's banging the President of the United States on the side, like that's a little bit like trashy romance novel, you know?
3293000	3303000	But it's not as, okay, coming from the fact that this show is created by the people that did, you know, Grey's Anatomy, they've toned it way down.
3303000	3309000	I mean, they've toned it way, way down, so you know, I'll give them props for that.
3309000	3316000	That actress is so good though, she just commands the screen, Kerry Washington, she just commands the screen, she's so fun to watch.
3316000	3317000	Games.
3317000	3318000	Sorry.
3318000	3323000	Well now they want to talk TV in chat, because act-def says Orange is the New Black is awesome.
3323000	3325000	I'm about three episodes in, it's pretty good.
3325000	3332000	No, I'm disappointed they got rid of it, because all these shows I'm catching on Netflix and stuff.
3332000	3336000	Better off Ted was actually great, I just don't understand why that show got cancelled.
3336000	3337000	No, we watched it.
3337000	3341000	It's too bad, it was great. I just, that's sad.
3341000	3346000	Shadow Next Chat in our chat says, everyone at OLR should check out the show Suits on USA Network.
3346000	3349000	The show is really well written and the cast plays off each other really well.
3349000	3355000	I have not seen that, but the show on USA that everybody tells me I need to watch is Psych.
3355000	3361000	Because that's the one that does all the tribute shows, like they did the Twin Peaks episode and the Clue episode, and they do all, yeah, that's the one I need to see.
3361000	3366000	There's only one show going to be coming out that I care about, I don't even know the name of it, but Seth Green's in it.
3366000	3369000	I am going to bring back, bring this back to games real quick here.
3369000	3370000	Alright, probably a good idea.
3370000	3375000	I did see an advertisement today on Nickelodeon, my son was watching Spongebob.
3375000	3382000	Next Saturday they're going to be launching the show for the Rabbids, the animated series, so that'll be coming next Saturday.
3382000	3383000	Somebody would be interested to check out it.
3383000	3385000	You let your son watch Spongebob?
3385000	3387000	Only at my, only at my mom's house.
3387000	3388000	Okay.
3388000	3392000	Alright, well let's move on. Speaking of kids, let's talk Nintendo.
3393000	3395000	Ah, bad transition, bad transition.
3395000	3401000	Alright, look, this is, I honestly file this a little more in fan wank and people dreaming of what could happen.
3401000	3408000	This is a huge leap of faith, but I will bring it up anyway since we're about discussing the news, not necessarily reporting it.
3408000	3413000	But apparently we heard about the problems that Atlus' parent company was having, right?
3414000	3421000	So there's this rumor out there that because there's going to be some subsidiary auctions going on on July 28th,
3421000	3432000	Atlus is one of those subsidiaries up for sale and Nintendo could be a key player in that because apparently there's already some financial liability in that whole situation.
3433000	3444000	So could Nintendo end up buying Atlus, which would mean that's a development company for them that could end up meaning Persona ends up being a Wii U exclusive,
3444000	3449000	Shin Megami Tensei ends up being a Wii and 3DS, Wii U exclusive and 3DS and so on.
3449000	3453000	Here's the quote from the International Digital Times, take it or leave it.
3463000	3469000	That's because Nintendo has been working unusually closely with Atlus lately, treating them practically like an in-house studio.
3469000	3474000	That may be because Atlus is about to become one. Again, that's from the International Digital Times.
3474000	3479000	No, and here's why. Because they've worked with other studios before on different things.
3479000	3488000	Like for example, and I think this is all coming from, first off there's the crossover game, the Shin Megami Tensei Fire Emblem game that's coming out on 3DS.
3489000	3499000	Now remember, they did something very similar back last year with Koei where they had the, I can't remember which game, it was a Koei game.
3499000	3500000	Was it the Romance of the Three Kingdoms?
3500000	3504000	The Romance of the Three Kingdoms cross Pokemon game or something like that. I think that's what it was.
3504000	3513000	And so they have that come out last year. So because they're working with them on that, I don't think that's necessarily a reason.
3513000	3522000	And just because they publish a lot of those games on 3DS and stuff, I don't think that's necessarily a reason that they're going to purchase that company.
3522000	3529000	Honestly, I think it's just going to get purchased by somebody else and it'll just continue kind of the way Atlus is going.
3529000	3538000	Maybe Marvelous USA or something like that will purchase Index Media, because that's kind of all the wheelhouse there.
3538000	3547000	Here's the weird thing though, today is July 28th, so it should be July 29th over in Japan. We haven't really heard what's come of this yet.
3547000	3548000	So it's a little...
3548000	3549000	It's also morning.
3549000	3557000	I guess that's true. But still, it was supposed to happen on July 28th, so I'm not sure why we haven't seen a fondant looking at news.
3557000	3565000	I just don't see Nintendo purchasing anybody because they already have enough, it wouldn't really change anything.
3565000	3574000	All they would be doing is kind of... I guess you would be able to get their games out a little wider audience, but they're already developing games on their platforms pretty much exclusively.
3574000	3587000	If Nintendo is really pushing more indie, as we're going to talk about later in the show, I think a company that makes a lot of really niche but very cultish type of games like Atlus does,
3587000	3594000	I think would be a really good partner for Nintendo to have. And Atlus still puts stuff out on Playstation platforms all the time, like Disgaea and all that.
3594000	3596000	What are you talking about? They don't just do Nintendo stuff.
3596000	3600000	But the vast majority is on the 3DS.
3600000	3610000	Still, for it to be exclusive, especially Persona, that's a huge one right there. If that series takes a leap over to Nintendo exclusive, that's a big thing.
3610000	3618000	I am kind of the mindset that I think most people that play Persona, and again, I am totally generalizing here and might be wrong, fine.
3618000	3625000	I think most people that play Persona are the type that probably collect a lot of video game systems anyway and already have a Wii U.
3625000	3630000	But I am kind of making a big assumption.
3630000	3635000	Well how about the reverse? We collect a lot of systems and I haven't played a single Persona game.
3635000	3638000	Maybe now you'll have a reason to, who knows?
3638000	3640000	No, because I don't have a Wii U.
3640000	3642000	Not yet.
3642000	3644000	Probably won't get one.
3644000	3646000	Not ever? Mario Kart 8 won't sway you?
3646000	3648000	I was never a big Mario Kart fan.
3648000	3651000	The Mario game at the end of the year won't sway you? There'll be something.
3651000	3657000	But I would not be surprised, Shin Megami Tensei characters in the next Smash Bros. game would not be surprised.
3657000	3663000	We just haven't been really excited. I mean, if something, like, I didn't get a 3DS until Animal Crossing came out.
3663000	3666000	And what if I've been playing a crap load of Animal Crossing?
3666000	3668000	There'll be that one game that gets you over it.
3668000	3669000	There might be.
3669000	3671000	Animal Crossing Wii U, it'll happen eventually.
3671000	3674000	I'm having more fun playing it portable. But I mean,
3674000	3675000	Wait.
3675000	3681000	But I mean, I'm honestly, I'm not really too excited about anything Nintendo's doing yet.
3681000	3682000	So.
3682000	3686000	Alright. ZZZ in our chatroom at live.voguenetwork.com says,
3686000	3689000	If Nintendo bought Atlus, I would put an Evoker to my head IRL.
3689000	3692000	Now, now, now. No need for that.
3692000	3694000	No need for that.
3694000	3695000	Let's not go to extremes here.
3697000	3702000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at voguenetwork.com,
3702000	3705000	use the passphrase, city.
3705000	3708000	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?
3708000	3713000	Well, a whole crap load of indie developers are coming together to be a supergroup.
3713000	3714000	No, I'm kidding.
3714000	3716000	They're making a game.
3716000	3720000	It's called Experiment 12.
3720000	3722000	And so these are 12 different developers.
3722000	3727000	Included, there's Terry Cavanaugh, who did VVVVVVV in Super Hexagon.
3727000	3734000	Ian Snyder, Jack King Spooner, Zarathustra, Richard Perrin, Michael Brau.
3734000	3737000	Yeah, just a bunch of people on the list.
3737000	3743000	It's supposed to be kind of an interesting game associated with mental illness.
3743000	3745000	But who knows what's going to happen.
3745000	3748000	We've only got a few screen caps out so far.
3748000	3752000	It's so far only on PC, but they're considering a Mac version.
3752000	3756000	So, interesting.
3756000	3760000	But I think it's a supergroup along the lines of Damn Yankees.
3760000	3764000	You know, they're going to get Ted Nugent to come out and play guitar.
3764000	3769000	That is the weirdest comparison you've ever made on this program.
3769000	3771000	Congratulations.
3771000	3773000	Well, I look forward to seeing what these guys come up with.
3773000	3775000	Ted Nugent, man? No.
3775000	3776000	Talk about crazy.
3776000	3779000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
3779000	3782000	and games that will be coming a little bit sooner than this experiment.
3782000	3785000	There's not a whole ton of stuff coming out this week.
3785000	3792000	Pretty much, you know, we've got the collector's edition of Terraria
3792000	3796000	coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3796000	3798000	That's kind of a big deal.
3798000	3802000	Yeah, it's just the game with, like, they have a pick-shaped USB drive
3802000	3804000	and there's some Vellum stickers and stuff.
3804000	3808000	The actual PlayStation 3 version is on, it's a card to download the game.
3808000	3811000	The 360 one, though, they put it on disk like Minecraft, so that's kind of cool.
3811000	3815000	Rise of the Triad this week on PC.
3815000	3817000	I'm actually looking forward to that.
3817000	3818000	Is that like the remake?
3818000	3819000	That's the remake, yeah.
3819000	3821000	That's going to be coming out, so that'll be pretty sweet.
3821000	3828000	On PlayStation 3, a game which I noticed you still haven't reviewed
3828000	3831000	or probably played yet, Arkania The Complete Tale is coming out this week.
3831000	3833000	Yeah, I got to get my review done this week.
3833000	3835000	So that's coming out.
3835000	3840000	And then, um, I think honestly that's it.
3840000	3843000	And I will have you know I have opened that case.
3843000	3845000	All right, I was just saying, yeah.
3845000	3849000	All right, no, I look forward to that on vognetwork.com soon.
3849000	3854000	Meanwhile, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.
3854000	3859000	August 1st on the PlayStation 3, we'll see the release of Killer Is Dead,
3859000	3860000	the premium edition.
3861000	3865000	Metro Last Like, it's a Japanese release this week as well on August 1st.
3865000	3874000	And Sengoku Hime 2, Okihaku Kakusei Mishidaiga in Limited and Regular editions comes out this week.
3874000	3876000	And I was just checking out what kind of game that is.
3876000	3880000	It looks like it's a strategy game featuring cute little anime girls.
3880000	3887000	And moving on to the Xbox 360 to see if we have anything there in Japan this week.
3887000	3892000	We have Killer Is Dead and Metro Last Like both over there as well.
3892000	3896000	Checking out some of the other consoles like PlayStation Vita.
3896000	3900000	PlayStation Vita has Mind Zero out this week on the Vita.
3900000	3912000	And on the 3DS this week we have Doki Doki Precure, Nari Kiri Life, and Osahare Na Koinu 3D come out this week.
3912000	3913000	Puppies!
3913000	3918000	And lastly on the Wii U, nothing till the 8th.
3918000	3920000	I think that was a game about puppies.
3921000	3925000	Actually, I gotta say the Wii U list looks really bare for August.
3925000	3930000	I hate to say it, maybe some games aren't dated yet, but the only other game for August is Wonderful 101.
3931000	3936000	Okay. Alright, that does it for Japanese releases. Let's check out the UK.
3936000	3938000	Only a bare few.
3938000	3941000	On, what's today again?
3941000	3942000	28th.
3942000	3950000	Yeah, on the 20th, actually only on the 31st, we have Pixel Junk Monsters Ultimate HD and I didn't see anything for the beginning of August, so...
3951000	3952000	Nada.
3952000	3959000	I forgot to mention, since it is kind of next Sunday, on the 4th, I believe Pikmin 3 is coming out, so that will be something.
3959000	3960000	Yes.
3960000	3962000	There's that whole early release, though.
3962000	3963000	Yeah.
3963000	3964000	Yeah.
3965000	3969000	Keep in mind, Shadow Next Gen, those were Japanese releases and I didn't see that on the list.
3969000	3972000	Maybe that was the game that was the 8th of August, so...
3973000	3978000	And those of you in chat that are saying Pikmin 3 is in August, again, those were Japanese releases I was reading.
3979000	3984000	Alright, let's go to a couple more stories and the classic game of the week, Loki.
3984000	3996000	Alright, so, I mean, even we've kind of seen this a little bit, or this isn't shocking news, but even with just like our small group of gamers here,
3996000	4004000	a lot of people have moved away from World of Warcraft to other things, and Activision Blizzard has obviously seen something very similar.
4004000	4013000	Their subscriber base has shrunk to 7.7 million users, which is still not a bad number, and that's down from 8.3 million users,
4013000	4020000	so they lost 600,000 people over the second quarter of this year.
4020000	4027000	And what are they doing to, I don't know, combat that?
4027000	4029000	No one likes pandas.
4030000	4044000	Nothing. Basically, so far they're not really saying anything. Their comment is, despite the shrinking subscriber base, you know, Activision Blizzard notes that World of Warcraft remains the number one subscription-based MMORPG.
4045000	4053000	Well, your competition in that field is very limited because the reason why they're losing players, it's free-to-play games.
4053000	4058000	Those people are going, like, I did not touch WoW this week. Not once.
4058000	4065000	And it's because I was, you know, playing other games like Dota 2, and these free-to-play games, I think, are really where WoW is hurting.
4065000	4069000	Warcraft is backed into a corner, I think they're going to need to go free-to-play.
4069000	4074000	I don't know how long Final Fantasy XIV is going to be able to get away with a subscription model, to be honest.
4074000	4077000	If World of Warcraft goes free-to-play, Final Fantasy XIV will...
4077000	4083000	Final Fantasy XIV is going to be backed into at least the buy-to-play, like Guild Wars model, it's going to have to.
4083000	4087000	That's acceptable. I'd probably play it if that was the case.
4087000	4094000	I don't know, though, they really talk about a lot, a lot of content for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, I mean, we'll see, but the problem with...
4094000	4100000	Warcraft is really just in this stagnant place right now, and, you know, I don't know what to say.
4100000	4103000	It's like they do keep trying to put out these new patches and things.
4103000	4107000	Do you think they're going to do, like, a new, like, a graphical overhaul of the whole game?
4107000	4116000	I think one of the two big things is coming with the next expansion at BlizzCon, and it's either going to be giant graphical overhaul to modernize the game.
4116000	4122000	Although, I don't know if they would want to cut out all these, you know, part of WoW's allure is that it runs on old systems.
4122000	4125000	But they do bump up the specs little by little each time.
4125000	4128000	Well, they could just have that as an option, you know, not necessarily...
4128000	4136000	Perhaps, perhaps. So, I believe that will either come out, or it's going to be free-to-play, but Warcraft's kind of backed into a corner at this point.
4136000	4137000	It's going to be one or the other.
4137000	4144000	I've already quit ages ago, because, I mean, I played through the panda stuff, and then it wasn't fun.
4144000	4149000	It just was more, it was the same reason I was quitting before, because I just kept getting bored.
4149000	4160000	I also shouldn't say it's going to go, necessarily, because, like, you know, if World of Warcraft had 100,000 subscribers, it's still making some pretty good money.
4160000	4164000	I mean, it wouldn't be a very pleasant place, but they'd still be making money.
4164000	4167000	But, you know, Blizzard is going to get people in in other ways.
4167000	4172000	Hearthstone, you know, is a free-to-play game. That's going to bring in some cash for them.
4172000	4175000	The Blizzard All-Stars thing they're working on, that's going to be a free-to-play game.
4175000	4177000	That's going to bring in some cash for them.
4177000	4182000	We don't know what the hell Titan's all about, but then again, that's not really going to be out at least until 2016 at this point.
4182000	4186000	SSG100Matt speculates that the graphic overhaul will be Titan.
4188000	4193000	You know, there is some buzz that Titan is World of Warcraft 2, but I don't know how much stock I put into that.
4193000	4196000	It's so far away that it probably doesn't even matter that way.
4196000	4201000	I sort of think EverQuest 2 and EverQuest kind of showed you really shouldn't do that to your MMO.
4202000	4205000	But yet, we have Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV.
4205000	4208000	Yeah, Final Fantasy XI is pretty much... meh.
4208000	4212000	Well, it has its fans that have stuck with it this long that'll keep with it. Who knows?
4212000	4217000	Well, hey, now that I'm working, I'm going to be playing XIV, so I've pretty much decided on that.
4217000	4218000	Good times.
4218000	4220000	And XI needs to go free-to-play.
4220000	4221000	We'll see.
4221000	4226000	Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys before the Classic Game of the Week.
4227000	4231000	Excuse me, and it's about the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3.
4231000	4232000	Aww.
4232000	4235000	It was about two years ago that Mega Man Legends 3 was cancelled.
4235000	4238000	We never really got the reasons why this game was cancelled,
4238000	4245000	but there was an interesting kind of report that came out this week about Gregaman, who's with Capcom Unity,
4245000	4250000	talking about a recap of things we've already expressed in one form or another.
4250000	4256000	So sort of a, I don't know, maybe like a post-mortem now all this time later about why the game was cancelled.
4257000	4264000	Remember that Legends 3 was essentially a ten-year late sequel to a sequel to a spin-off
4264000	4269000	that had middling success even back when it was one of the only games of its kind,
4269000	4274000	before 3D action-adventure was an established genre, if you can even remember that far back.
4274000	4277000	And consider its place within the greater Mega Man brand.
4277000	4281000	If you thought DMC was a deviation from the Devil May Cry brand,
4281000	4285000	remember that MML changed virtually everything you could possibly change about Mega Man.
4285000	4290000	Even I remember scoffing at the sight of it until I got my hands on it and realized it stood on its own.
4290000	4291000	Merits.
4291000	4296000	Then consider that the game was designed for a platform that didn't even exist yet in the wild.
4296000	4301000	All that isn't to say that MML 3 was a bad project, it was just weird.
4301000	4307000	But MML has always been a passion project, not a cash cow, hence the Dev Room angle.
4307000	4311000	And there is a little YouTube that showed a little bit of play from the game that's out there,
4311000	4317000	but they go on to talk about involvement in the community and so forth.
4317000	4324000	At the same time though, they're putting out risks for different things.
4324000	4329000	They're rebooting Strider, they made the Bionic Commando game, stuff like that.
4329000	4334000	And in saying that it's completely different than the other Mega Man games,
4334000	4337000	well, every Mega Man series is different than the other Mega Man games.
4338000	4341000	Okay, so it wasn't a 2D platformer game.
4341000	4343000	So what, Zelda?
4343000	4347000	The 3D Zeldas weren't 2D platformer games anymore?
4347000	4350000	Are you saying that wasn't worth the risk?
4350000	4353000	Or Wind Waker is completely different than all the other games?
4353000	4359000	Yet we're getting the re-release of that because apparently it just sucked so bad that we're just going to re-release it again, right?
4359000	4361000	It's not because people liked it or anything.
4361000	4366000	I don't understand. Wasn't this whole trial version of Mega Man Legends 3 that they were going to put on the eShop for five bucks?
4366000	4369000	Wasn't this practically done before they pulled the rug on it?
4369000	4374000	Pretty much, and I thought the whole thing was just to gauge interest in that stuff.
4374000	4377000	So release it. It doesn't make sense. I don't know.
4377000	4379000	Make a download. Just make a download only.
4379000	4382000	That was the plan for the prototype thing they were going to do.
4382000	4386000	They were basically going to do a paid demo to see if people were interested in the game.
4386000	4388000	Give it to some fanboys and let them finish the last steps.
4388000	4391000	That's what they do now for everything on their stuff. Remember all the, what was it?
4391000	4396000	Dead Rising Zero stuff where it's a prequel but it's really just a demo.
4396000	4399000	It's disappointing.
4399000	4404000	Alright, let's travel back to a time when things were a little simpler.
4404000	4413000	Maybe because we didn't have the internet or anything like that, we didn't get disappointed when games suddenly got cancelled.
4413000	4417000	Although they might show up in a Nintendo Power and then suddenly disappear.
4417000	4422000	Or in this case, a Genesis Power. Or who knows. Or a Sega Master System Power.
4422000	4425000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4425000	4429000	Fantasy Star! Weee, which I can't believe I haven't done this one yet.
4429000	4432000	And I can't believe you haven't done it either. You kind of brought this up earlier in the show, didn't you?
4432000	4438000	I did because Dan's playing the Sega Ages Generation 1, which is Fantasy Star.
4438000	4446000	We bought these back when the Sega Ages ones came out, except it was all in Japanese and our friend was trying to translate while we were playing.
4446000	4452000	And she's like, oh well this part isn't important, you don't need to know what they said. So we're like okay, we'll stop playing it.
4452000	4460000	Dan actually, someone has done an English patch. And I linked from the Generations one because the music in it was so good.
4460000	4472000	But the first Fantasy Star came out on the Master System and it came out in Japan on December 20th, 1987 and then in North America and Europe in 1988.
4472000	4484000	It is one of the, I'd say, granddaddies of the RPG genre and it's also one of the first games that had a female protagonist.
4484000	4491000	There have been other versions of it. Fantasy Star Collection came out for Sega Saturn and PS2.
4491000	4499000	And then there's a Game Boy Advance version in North America and a Virtual Console re-release for the Weee in 2009.
4500000	4509000	So basically it's pretty traditional for RPG format. You go over your overworld maps, you talk to people.
4509000	4518000	Your dungeons though are done sort of a pseudo 3D where you're walking through kind of first person perspective like it's Doom or something.
4518000	4527000	And then it flashes into an over the shoulder view when you're fighting critters and stuff.
4527000	4535000	And they even have little animations which is a lot more than Final Fantasy had at that time.
4535000	4541000	And you get different weapons and magic and you have really memorable characters.
4541000	4546000	You had Alice, you had Meow, who's like this kind of cat thing.
4546000	4551000	And Odin and Noah, basically those are your main characters through the whole thing.
4551000	4553000	You've got your antagonists.
4553000	4561000	Basically this is one of the, and especially for the Sega fans, this is the game to have.
4561000	4566000	Thankfully we've got all the Fantasy Star games complete in their boxes.
4566000	4571000	And trust me, it's something that's just really fun to have.
4571000	4577000	Now like I said, it did get a re-release through the Sega Ages branding.
4577000	4582000	And I think that the Generation 1 is really good.
4582000	4593000	It's basically just touched up. It maybe looks like an early PS1 RPG, a little bit cleaner maybe.
4593000	4599000	I mean you're taking a game from the Master System and updating everything in it.
4599000	4604000	So it's a very, very good translation. The music's great, the graphics great, really fun to play.
4604000	4607000	And there is an English patch out right now if you've got a PS2 emulator.
4607000	4612000	Although I can't say go do it, go do it, go do it, because that would be wrong.
4613000	4625000	The game right now, as far as the Master System version, it can go for a lot.
4625000	4631000	When the game first came out, it retailed for $70 and some places sold it for $80.
4631000	4637000	And keep in mind, this was an 8-bit game. So that was a lot of money for an early game.
4637000	4642000	And other ones that sold more than that were like Time Zone.
4642000	4646000	But Phantasy Star was the most expensive console game ever sold at its time.
4646000	4651000	And it did get a price drop when the Master System 2 hardware came out.
4651000	4656000	It had sequels of course. We had Phantasy Star 2, 3, and 4.
4656000	4661000	If I'm right, I think 3 is the one that's really hard to find.
4661000	4664000	Of course the other ones came out on the Genesis slash Master System.
4665000	4671000	With the Japanese release, one really neat thing about the first one is that it did take advantage of the FM chip.
4671000	4677000	The Yamaha YM2413 chip. So it had some really good sound.
4677000	4682000	But since the North American and PAL systems didn't have that chip, it doesn't sound quite as good.
4682000	4685000	But on Virtual Console, you get an option of playing it with the FM soundtrack.
4686000	4696000	So this is probably one of the greatest video games of all time. Especially in the RPG genre.
4696000	4705000	And it's actually, as far as its popularity when it came out, it actually went sort of outside video game publications.
4705000	4708000	And was even mentioned in like Boy's Life.
4708000	4714000	So, I don't even know if that magazine is out anymore, but wasn't it like one of old camping...
4714000	4717000	Wasn't that the Boy Scouts magazine or something?
4717000	4718000	I thought so.
4718000	4722000	Yeah, I think it was. I think I used to get it when I was in Cub Scouts.
4722000	4729000	But I mean, seriously, if none of you have... I'll be honest, I didn't play it when it came out.
4729000	4736000	I played it as an adult. But even me coming into it as an adult, I still enjoyed it.
4736000	4739000	So it's one that anyone can pick up if you love RPGs.
4739000	4753000	And I also, being a fan of Phantasy Star Online, it's sort of neat seeing how some of the graphics in the updated version actually correspond to some of the updates in the Phantasy Star Online series.
4753000	4754000	So it's pretty neat.
4754000	4756000	Kind of seeing where it all came from.
4756000	4763000	Yeah, it's like they pulled the original concepts and then with what they're doing for Phantasy Star Online, they're sort of merging the two.
4763000	4771000	Sort of bringing one up to date. A little bit slightly different, but they have lots in common stylistically.
4771000	4773000	So, that's it, Phantasy Star.
4773000	4777000	Alright, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week Phantasy Star for the Sega Master System.
4777000	4782000	Although, certainly the Sega Ages series on PlayStation 2 is a big part of that as well.
4783000	4788000	Yeah, and like I said, it has been translated however you want to play it.
4788000	4791000	Alright, or watch people play it on YouTube like we've been doing here in the studio.
4791000	4792000	Alright.
4792000	4794000	How much Mercedes do you have on you, Rob?
4794000	4797000	Umm, 50 bucks maybe?
4797000	4801000	I had to laugh because Dan actually called me when I was in the back room last night saying,
4801000	4804000	I finally got to the Rappies! Come look at them!
4804000	4807000	I was like, I'm watching Dan kill Rappies because I hate Rappies.
4807000	4808000	Good times.
4808000	4814000	Yeah, it's interesting how much of that, you know, playing Phantasy Star Online as much as I did,
4814000	4817000	it's interesting kind of going back to the Phantasy Star games and seeing like,
4817000	4820000	where the Monomates and the Telepipes and all that come from.
4820000	4822000	And yes, the Rappies too, you know?
4822000	4825000	I have to tell you a story about Julie.
4825000	4826000	Okay.
4826000	4827000	You know which Julie I'm talking about.
4827000	4828000	Of course, yeah.
4828000	4832000	Julie paid $120 to order a Rappy plushie.
4832000	4833000	Oh wow.
4833000	4835000	That's as big as my upper torso.
4835000	4837000	That's dedication.
4837000	4839000	Probably almost as wide as your table.
4839000	4841000	I have a gigantic Pikachu.
4841000	4844000	Okay, take your Pikachu and make the Rappy a little bit bigger than that.
4844000	4845000	Yeah.
4845000	4848000	And fully stuffed in, you know, with the bits and everything.
4848000	4850000	That's because she was that much into PSO at the time.
4850000	4852000	That sounds adorable.
4852000	4854000	That sounds like a waste of money.
4854000	4856000	Judge, judge, judge.
4856000	4857000	We all do silly things.
4857000	4858000	Alright.
4858000	4859000	I would have just made one.
4859000	4861000	We're going to take a break, guys, when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,
4861000	4863000	some rapid fire news.
4863000	4866000	Of course, the mailbag, what little may be in there.
4866000	4868000	And we'll talk a little bit of Ouya.
4868000	4872000	And take your calls as well if we have some folks who want to call tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4872000	4877000	But all that when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4883000	4888000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening,
4888000	4893000	July the 28th, 2013, with the 514th episode of our show.
4893000	4895000	We're going to get back into some news here in a moment.
4895000	4897000	I just want to make sure I got a clear plug out here.
4897000	4899000	I mentioned this in the beginning of the show,
4899000	4904000	but I just want to make sure I got a plug out here to my buddies over at Game Buoy Podcast.
4904000	4906000	That's gamebuoy.org.
4906000	4908000	Just think Game Boy, but B-U-O-Y.
4908000	4910000	Gamebuoy.org.
4910000	4914000	I'm going to be on episode 33, part B of their show.
4914000	4917000	The episode was so long, they split it up into two parts.
4917000	4920000	But I'll be on the part B, which was like almost three hours in itself.
4920000	4923000	We talked all about music games tonight was the topic.
4923000	4926000	So, or I should say today, music games was the topic.
4926000	4929000	So, you know, just having done the early days of OLR,
4929000	4931000	we were nothing but music game chat.
4931000	4934000	I had a lot to talk about, hence why the show was so damn long.
4934000	4937000	But it was a really good time. We had a lot of fun taping it.
4937000	4939000	So be sure to check that out over at gamebuoy.org.
4939000	4943000	Episode 33B I will be on.
4943000	4946000	First Mate Slidekick should have that posted on Monday.
4946000	4949000	It's not up there yet, although it is a fantabulous show.
4949000	4951000	You can go check out their old episodes.
4951000	4954000	Alright, let's get back into some rapid fire news.
4954000	4955000	Loki.
4955000	4959000	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about old games.
4959000	4962000	For example, Star Control.
4962000	4966000	Star Control was one of the franchises that was being auctioned off
4966000	4972000	as part of this whole Atari catalog auction thing.
4972000	4976000	And Star Control is actually one of my favorite PC games.
4976000	4981000	It was an old strategy game that you play like a bunch of different spaceships.
4981000	4985000	And there is a really good one-on-one space combat portion of the game.
4985000	4989000	And now it's hopefully coming back.
4989000	4994000	And this is partly due to Stardock buying the franchise rights.
4994000	4998000	And so now they're planning on hopefully rebooting that franchise.
4998000	5000000	So that's pretty sweet.
5000000	5006000	Some of the other franchises that were sold off and that were purchased.
5006000	5008000	Or I should say, yeah, bidding.
5008000	5010000	So we had Rebellion.
5010000	5013000	They've picked up the Battlezone franchise.
5013000	5019000	Wargaming has picked up Total Annihilation, which is not too surprising.
5019000	5022000	They also picked up Master of Orion.
5022000	5027000	And Rebellion also picking up Moonbase Commander.
5027000	5031000	Epic geared the Backyard Sports franchise, which was terrible.
5031000	5034000	And then Tomo picked up a bunch of random stuff,
5034000	5037000	because they produced a lot of weird DS titles.
5037000	5041000	Like Humongous franchise.
5041000	5045000	Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise and Math Grand Prix.
5045000	5048000	Wait, Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise?
5048000	5051000	Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise.
5051000	5054000	I'm assuming these are all educational PC titles at some time.
5054000	5057000	What exactly would Fatty Bear get as a birthday surprise?
5057000	5059000	Of course, a fatty.
5059000	5060000	Some honey.
5060000	5062000	A rice cake.
5062000	5065000	Fatty Bear. He gets cholesterol.
5065000	5068000	Oh, Loki, you could appreciate this.
5068000	5070000	Tangent time. Choo choo, tangent time.
5070000	5074000	Okay, so, Alan and I went to the State Fair on Friday.
5074000	5077000	And you know they've got deep fried food like crazy.
5077000	5078000	Yeah.
5078000	5079000	Act surprised, act surprised.
5079000	5080000	Alright.
5080000	5081000	So there's a booth there.
5081000	5082000	Oh my god!
5082000	5084000	That has all these deep fried foods, right?
5084000	5086000	Now what I really want to try is the deep fried coke.
5086000	5088000	They don't have that here at this booth.
5088000	5090000	How do you deep fry a coke? Is it like a can that's breaded?
5090000	5093000	No, it's like syrup and they make little syrup balls out of it.
5093000	5096000	But anyway, so we're trying to decide. What do we get?
5096000	5098000	Do we get a deep fried peanut butter cup?
5098000	5100000	Do we get a deep fried Twinkie?
5100000	5102000	Uh oh, Alan's here.
5102000	5107000	So we narrow it down to, we either get deep fried cheesecake,
5107000	5110000	deep fried red velvet,
5110000	5114000	but we settled on deep fried Oreos.
5114000	5118000	And Alan, do you want to talk about how they tasted?
5118000	5122000	They were really good, but at the same time it's almost too much.
5122000	5125000	I'm at that age where I'm like, okay, it's not disgusting,
5125000	5127000	but like I only just wanted one or two.
5127000	5129000	And you made me, you made me three of them out of the four.
5129000	5133000	Because I only wanted one because I'm like, my stomach already feels gross.
5133000	5135000	I don't want, if I eat more than one,
5135000	5138000	then we're not going to be leaving here for an hour while I'm in the porta potti.
5138000	5142000	But there's so much batter that they're actually kind of plum sized
5142000	5145000	because there's so much dough around the cookie and then you bite into it
5145000	5149000	and the cookie actually isn't crunchy. It's all warm and gooey inside.
5149000	5153000	Yeah. So it was delicious. Have you had deep fried Oreos, Loki?
5153000	5159000	No, but I'm very disappointed that you didn't talk about the booth dedicated to bacon.
5159000	5161000	They had a whole bacon booth.
5161000	5163000	We didn't find the bacon dedicated booth.
5163000	5165000	We saw like the chocolate covered bacon
5165000	5168000	and we saw the bacon maple something, something.
5168000	5170000	No, they had a whole booth that was dedicated to bacon there.
5170000	5171000	Oh, we missed that.
5171000	5172000	I didn't go.
5172000	5173000	I don't see how you could have missed that.
5173000	5177000	I mean, there should have been mile, you know, mile long lines going to that booth.
5177000	5180000	No, it was empty. We went Friday morning, like first day off work.
5180000	5181000	Yeah, no one's the same for anymore.
5181000	5184000	We went like first thing. But anyway, so, uh,
5184000	5187000	I guess Fatty Bear would want some deep fried Oreos. I don't know.
5187000	5188000	They had deep fried bacon there.
5188000	5193000	So fried Coke is when they take a funnel cake batter
5193000	5197000	and they put Coke syrup in it until it turns brown inside of Coke flavored.
5197000	5200000	They drizzle it into the hot grease so that it looks like a funnel cake.
5200000	5202000	It's all just, you know, the little ropes of dough.
5202000	5206000	And then they put that in a cup and they sprinkle powdered sugar on it.
5206000	5209000	And then they put more pure Coke syrup on top of that.
5209000	5212000	And that's fried Coke. And then fried Kool-Aid is pretty much the same thing.
5212000	5215000	They put Kool-Aid in the dough or in the batter,
5215000	5219000	and then they put Torani strawberry syrup on it.
5219000	5222000	I remember when we did fried Twinkies at, um,
5222000	5226000	I do. That was like, that was like our sideshow at, um, it w it wasn't,
5226000	5230000	it was a shaft Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.
5230000	5234000	Yeah. We had fried Twinkies for no reason.
5234000	5235000	I made it through half of one.
5235000	5238000	I know they're so right. Anyway. Um, let's see.
5238000	5241000	I just want to go to our chat room at live.vogniteware.com
5241000	5245000	because we have a ionotropic says Loki wants deep fried gummy bears,
5245000	5247000	three pound bag version.
5247000	5252000	Why would you want that? By the way, I saw a tweet from you.
5252000	5256000	That was like my stomach so full. I was like, why do I keep eating these things?
5256000	5260000	They're still eating them as I'm posting it. Delicious. Uh, yeah.
5260000	5263000	So basically, um, yeah, it took me two days to get through that three pound bag.
5263000	5267000	Um, yeah, actually I wouldn't want deep fried.
5267000	5270000	It would just dissolve into mush because it would, you know,
5270000	5272000	would liquefy some weird stuff.
5272000	5274000	Like this one booth had like 20 different things.
5274000	5278000	There were deep fried pop tarts and I was like, that's already bready.
5278000	5281000	Like why would you just want to put more dough on that deep fried?
5281000	5285000	Did they have deep fried fruity pebbles, deep fried fruity pebbles?
5285000	5288000	And then I think deep fried cocoa puffs and captain crunch. Yeah.
5288000	5291000	Like different cereal. Yeah. Fruity pebbles might've been all right.
5291000	5295000	See that's something more of your bread it with that, you know? All right.
5295000	5298000	Anyway, I'm just going to tell you right now that all of that sounds really disgusting.
5298000	5301000	What gave me the fatty bear? Here's the one that was discussing.
5301000	5302000	I remember what they called it,
5302000	5304000	but it was as a deep fried Twinkie with some sort of cheese on it.
5304000	5309000	I think it was either cheese whiz or like some sort of nacho cheese wrapped in bacon.
5309000	5315000	Or, you know, it was as a Twinkie wrapped in bacon with cheese and then deep fried.
5315000	5318000	I'm having a heart attack listening to you. Stop.
5318000	5322000	Spray cheese is always automatically disgusting. I'm sorry.
5322000	5326000	True lifestyle. It's easy. Cheese is gross.
5326000	5329000	When it says cheese food on the label, you know, that's what cheese eats.
5329000	5331000	All right. Anyhow, back to video game news.
5331000	5336000	Thank you, Alan, for bringing a little fatty bear to our show.
5336000	5339000	I didn't mean that in a negative way. Where are you going?
5339000	5342000	All right. Moving on. Sorry, Logie.
5342000	5346000	All right. OK, so beyond those.
5346000	5349000	So Nintendo getting actually a little bit of love.
5349000	5354000	Activision has been back and forth. Is Call of Duty Ghost coming to the Wii or not?
5354000	5360000	And it is. So it will be coming out November 5th along the other platforms.
5360000	5365000	And, yeah. And Treyarch will be doing the port on that.
5365000	5369000	So not a big surprise there because they do all the Wii ports and Wii U ports now, I guess.
5369000	5376000	And last but not least, they're already talking about the DLC plan for Saints Row IV,
5376000	5379000	which doesn't sound like much as far as like content stuff.
5379000	5383000	The first piece of DLC is going to be the Enter the Dominatrix.
5383000	5388000	Now you may be thinking, hey, wait a second. Didn't Enter the Dominatrix become Saints Row IV?
5388000	5390000	I mean, they kind of expanded upon it.
5390000	5393000	Well, it's not necessarily going to be...
5393000	5396000	That's kind of all the stuff they cut out of the game.
5396000	5398000	Stuff that they couldn't really work in there.
5398000	5404000	Now there's going to be some sort of mockumentary take on like all the things that they couldn't do for the game,
5404000	5407000	but they're going to put in there anyways.
5407000	5410000	I did watch some interesting interviews.
5410000	5415000	They were talking about how they kind of pulled a Bethesda a little bit, you know, where they gave the...
5415000	5421000	You remember the Skyrim team had, you know, a week to develop whatever they wanted for the game.
5421000	5424000	And so Saints Row, they did the same thing in Volition.
5424000	5428000	They had all sorts of things like a dragon that breathed fire that you would have been able to ride
5428000	5431000	was one of the things that, you know, they were going to try to do.
5431000	5435000	But it just didn't work in the game, you know, some of the limitations and stuff.
5435000	5439000	So I hope some of that stuff becomes DLC. That would be pretty cool.
5439000	5445000	But they do have a season pass that they announced that's only two pieces of DLC and it's $10.
5445000	5449000	That once again, as we were talking about before in part A, that's a bundle.
5449000	5453000	That's not a season pass as a bundle of DLC because it's two.
5453000	5455000	The season pass is not two things.
5457000	5459000	So I guess I'll have to buy it because it's only two.
5459000	5464000	A season pass would be they give you these two things and then you've paid for the other stuff that comes out that season.
5464000	5469000	Well, I have a feeling there's going to be a ton of customization DLC like they've had before.
5469000	5471000	It's all paid unlock stuff.
5471000	5474000	But I'm sure they're going to have that available.
5474000	5477000	That's how they did Saints Row the Third.
5478000	5483000	Alright. Well, moving on to some other stories in gaming real quick here.
5483000	5488000	Connect Sports Rivals, that was one of those games that was announced for Xbox One at E3.
5488000	5492000	It has been confirmed that it will miss the launch window.
5492000	5495000	Originally this game was going to come out in November.
5495000	5503000	However, Microsoft told Polygon that there is a delay and it is necessary in order to give Rare enough time to polish it up before launch.
5503000	5505000	So it just wasn't ready to go.
5505000	5508000	Spring of next year, the new time frame that's being given for that.
5508000	5512000	These things happen all of the time. Launch games get pushed back.
5512000	5514000	Wasn't Pikmin 3 supposed to be a launch game for the Wii U?
5514000	5517000	And now it's just now coming out? These things happen.
5517000	5519000	You know what? Take the time to get it right.
5519000	5522000	Even though this game doesn't really sound like one I'm really interested in anyway.
5522000	5525000	And so it might be interesting for other people. It's one of those family games.
5525000	5527000	Yeah, it's a family game, kiddie game.
5527000	5531000	Families aren't going to be picking up Dead Rising 3 for their little kids.
5531000	5532000	True, very true.
5532000	5535000	Are you kidding? I would totally play that when I was a kid.
5535000	5539000	Hopefully this delay won't cause people to go over to the Wii U.
5539000	5541000	Or, well, depending on how you look at it.
5541000	5544000	Maybe this delay will, yay, make people go over to the Wii U.
5544000	5545000	However you're looking at it.
5545000	5550000	But the Wii U is looking at possibly a Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD bundle.
5550000	5551000	I can see it.
5551000	5555000	This is a report from an inventory system at a major US retailer.
5555000	5557000	We don't know which one so take this with a big grain of salt.
5557000	5560000	And these stories are often a little eh.
5560000	5562000	Unless Loki of course is the one reporting on it because I trust him.
5562000	5566000	But Nintendo is looking at a Wii U bundle for Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD.
5566000	5570000	Supposedly a 3DS handheld that comes with Pokemon X and Pokemon Y as well.
5571000	5575000	Although aren't there those limited edition 3DSs with Pokemon with the art on them?
5575000	5576000	I know those are coming out in Japan.
5576000	5579000	So it would seem very logical those come out here too.
5579000	5580000	Those might come out over here.
5580000	5584000	We're supposed to be getting that 3DS, the black 3DS XL next month.
5584000	5587000	The one that was rumored to be coming out over here is actually coming over here next month.
5587000	5593000	And surprisingly enough, actually, Zelda is coming out a lot earlier than I thought it would be.
5593000	5596000	Because I pegged that as like a November title.
5596000	5600000	But they said it was October and it's actually the first week of October.
5600000	5603000	Well yeah, I was going to say October is when these games are launching.
5603000	5605000	So you could bet that this bundle will come out at the same time.
5605000	5609000	First week of October for that and third or fourth for Wii Party U.
5609000	5610000	Which no one gives a shit about.
5610000	5612000	Hey, you never know.
5612000	5613000	There might be that one fan.
5613000	5617000	And then there's probably, I'm assuming November is going to be the 3DS XL then.
5617000	5621000	Or Super Mario World 3D.
5621000	5624000	Now this is really interesting.
5624000	5627000	Disney is looking into a new technology called Aireal.
5627000	5629000	It's A-I-R-E-A-L.
5629000	5634000	Not to be confused with like a trick or a Disney princess that lives under the sea.
5634000	5640000	Aireal is a new invention that blows air that's supposed to simulate a tactile experience.
5640000	5643000	So in other words, you're supposed to be able to feel objects.
5643000	5647000	Where there might not necessarily be one because of the way the air goes.
5647000	5656000	It was created by PhD student Rajinidhar Sadi and a Disney researcher Ivan Popryev.
5656000	5659000	It can be placed on a TV or even on an iPad.
5659000	5666000	And it can actually simulate buttons to touching in mid-air to making you feel like water, stone, sand.
5666000	5668000	This could actually be something really cool.
5668000	5672000	You know, my mind always goes to Disney theme parks and how could that make rides feel.
5672000	5674000	That might be really cool.
5674000	5676000	I just don't understand how that would work.
5676000	5682000	The tech is in a very early phase, so no word on where this is going.
5682000	5686000	But they have a YouTube app if you want to see more about it.
5686000	5689000	So, there you go.
5689000	5692000	So, can you write over there?
5692000	5695000	I hate Destructoid for iPad.
5695000	5696000	Oh yeah.
5696000	5699000	Hate. It brings up an ad and then it shuts down my safari.
5699000	5700000	Oh.
5700000	5703000	So, I'm on spite. Don't want to read that story.
5703000	5705000	Which one was it?
5705000	5707000	The Zelda mod.
5707000	5709000	I can mention it real quick here.
5709000	5715000	So, Jamie out of spite will not be telling you about this Legend of Zelda mod.
5715000	5717000	It's got a great trailer, by the way.
5717000	5718000	Does it?
5718000	5720000	Yeah, it's a fantastic trailer.
5720000	5726000	Lissy, apparently it's this mod for Zelda. I'm trying to figure out what Zelda game it is.
5726000	5729000	It's not for Zelda. It's all the different Zelda.
5729000	5733000	It's almost like all the different Zelda worlds put together.
5733000	5736000	And it's the medieval Total War.
5736000	5740000	Oh, so it's the other way around. It's the Zelda hack for medieval Total War.
5740000	5748000	It's really crazy. The trailer they've got giant characters and stuff.
5748000	5750000	Of course there's an ad on there.
5750000	5752000	All I read was carrying around Link's dead corpse.
5752000	5756000	And I do give the ad credit because I did see the same ad earlier today
5756000	5759000	and I did not know Cigarose had a new album coming out.
5759000	5762000	Yes, it's out now actually.
5762000	5764000	They're going on tour again. Ooh, I really need to see them.
5764000	5766000	They're a great band.
5766000	5771000	But anyways, they've got some really crazy stuff as you get into it.
5771000	5777000	Let me get a little further if it's into it.
5777000	5779000	I didn't know who some of the characters were.
5779000	5781000	I mean, obviously I know who that is.
5781000	5787000	But they had some of the guy from Majora's Mask or whatever in there.
5787000	5788000	This looks neat.
5788000	5791000	It looks very, very epic.
5791000	5793000	Some of it looks a little bad.
5793000	5795000	A little derpy, yeah.
5795000	5797000	Her crying looks a little bad.
5797000	5799000	Well, I think it's supposed to be like some sort of...
5799000	5801000	But yeah, that thing looks cool. I don't know what that is.
5801000	5803000	But I didn't play any of the threes.
5803000	5807000	It kind of makes you want to check out Medieval 2 Total War, doesn't it?
5807000	5810000	Yeah, but let's see if this is the one.
5810000	5813000	Towards the end there, they've got some really cool stuff.
5813000	5814000	Neat.
5814000	5815000	Yeah.
5815000	5817000	Okay, Jamie, there you go.
5817000	5823000	Thank you, because their page has never worked right on my iPad.
5823000	5825000	Stop crashing people's iPads, fools.
5825000	5828000	Your developers seriously need to have their hands slapped.
5828000	5829000	Just saying.
5829000	5831000	Destructoid, hire better designers.
5831000	5834000	Oh, snap. Gauntlet throne.
5834000	5842000	Anyway, there is a report that a Gran Turismo movie is in development.
5842000	5848000	It's supposed to be produced by, let's see, Michael DeLuca and Dana Brunetti.
5848000	5852000	And they're also the people that are working on Fifty Shades of Shit.
5852000	5854000	I mean, Grey.
5854000	5857000	So I don't know how I would think about that.
5857000	5860000	Whatever.
5860000	5866000	And then, in other news, this is...
5866000	5869000	Well, you know, we rag on dating games every so often,
5869000	5871000	but this one is just hilarious.
5871000	5879000	There is an appearance in a dating game by Keiji Inafune.
5879000	5881000	It's basically, the game is called Sweet Fuse.
5881000	5883000	It's a dating game for the PSP.
5883000	5887000	And you can seduce one of seven steamy bachelors.
5887000	5888000	Ooh.
5888000	5893000	But Inafune is in the game and you can court him.
5893000	5896000	I was right, they have that coming out on PSP over here in the August.
5896000	5897000	Yeah.
5897000	5899000	Now that I know what that is, that's even creepier.
5899000	5904000	His portrait here looks creepy.
5904000	5908000	And he's listed as Legendary Creator.
5908000	5909000	So that's it.
5909000	5912000	Alright, unfortunately there's no FUGL question of the week this week.
5912000	5913000	I talked about that earlier.
5913000	5915000	Just thank my busy, hectic schedule.
5915000	5921000	I didn't even get around to thinking about OLR until an hour before we started the show tonight.
5921000	5924000	So that segment will be back in two weeks when we return,
5924000	5927000	as we will not be having a show live here next week.
5927000	5929000	Let's move on though to some more news in the meantime.
5929000	5933000	Alright, so sales haven't been that great.
5933000	5935000	There was an article that was on Gamasutra.
5935000	5940000	And they were talking, or I should say polling some of the developers that have games on there.
5940000	5945000	And they were talking about some of the attach rates and stuff and how not good they are.
5945000	5950000	For example, one of the games, I guess Hidden in Plain Sight,
5950000	5955000	it's brought in $4,381 on 1,900 purchases.
5955000	5958000	And that was basically sold at a pay-what-you-want price.
5958000	5961000	So, you know, minimum of a dollar.
5961000	5964000	Also, there was another game, Get on Top.
5964000	5972000	It's earned $728 off of 9,700 downloads and 520 purchases off that.
5972000	5979000	They were saying some of them, like Bomb Squad, which is one of the more popular games,
5979000	5982000	he's peaked, I guess, 200 sales per day.
5982000	5987000	And now it's sort of around 70 per day, which is a $5 game.
5990000	5997000	There's a really indie guy who created a game called Bomb Ball who's made a little over $30 a day.
5997000	5999000	That's not terrible.
5999000	6002000	I mean, for an indie, you know, maybe that's not terrible.
6003000	6010000	And then Tower Fall, which is probably one of the most notable games on the Ouya right now,
6010000	6014000	he said they've reached about 2,000 sales so far at $15 each.
6014000	6018000	So, you know, $30,000?
6021000	6030000	But basically, overall, the stats have shown that I want to say that only about 27% of people that have an Ouya
6030000	6035000	have actually bought games for it, whereas everyone else is just playing kind of free stuff.
6035000	6039000	I want to say it was 27%. It was some ridiculously high number.
6039000	6041000	Now, are we talking, like, actual free stuff?
6041000	6045000	Like, I don't know, the Amazing Frog and the parking valet or No Brakes valet
6045000	6048000	and the stuff that's actually free on there, or do you think emulators?
6048000	6051000	I think it's just that they're playing a lot of the free stuff.
6051000	6053000	I don't think that it's necessarily...
6053000	6056000	I think that a lot of the developers on there are...
6058000	6061000	Yeah, 73% of owners haven't bought a thing.
6061000	6063000	So I don't think right now that...
6064000	6071000	I think that some of the developers that are on there probably have never published a game before.
6071000	6077000	It may not know how much of the game to give away for free.
6077000	6082000	You know, like, there was something... I don't remember which game it was, but they were saying, like,
6082000	6090000	they had certain difficulty levels that were available, and the higher difficulties were behind a paywall.
6090000	6095000	Well, it ended up that a lot of people were just comfortable playing at the easy difficulties of that game,
6095000	6098000	and so not a lot of people were paying for that.
6098000	6102000	And so it comes to the point where, well, they could change it.
6102000	6107000	They could put out a new version of the game and change all that, or they just leave it alone and drop the price or something.
6107000	6113000	So I think a lot of it's just experiment and a lot of new people putting stuff on there that, you know,
6113000	6120000	they may not be... they may not know all the tricks to being able to bring in revenue on that kind of pay model.
6120000	6126000	You know, it leads us to this interesting comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com from our pal Bobby Blackwolf,
6126000	6129000	who says, why buy games when you can pirate them so easily?
6130000	6136000	Yeah, that's the thing, though, is you can't really pirate Ouya games too easily on there, at least as far as I'm aware.
6136000	6144000	You can pirate all other Android games on there quite easily, but you can't pirate Ouya games themselves very easily, that I've seen.
6145000	6150000	But yeah, because they don't have the Google Play Marketplace tied to this console,
6150000	6156000	there's nothing to check for the authenticity of, you know, those purchases.
6156000	6163000	So anything that you side load on there, if you happen to download a random API for anything, it will just run it.
6163000	6167000	Full version or whatever, and it'll just run it without having to purchase it.
6167000	6175000	So yeah, in that sense, it is really easy to pirate games on there, but for the actual Ouya games, it's not, because of the way they have it.
6175000	6180000	Now, that could very well change if, you know, I don't know what they would have to do to do that,
6180000	6184000	or if they can even put the Google Play Store on there. I know you can side load that.
6186000	6189000	But yeah, it's just... it's just tricky.
6189000	6194000	And once again, you know, with other consoles coming out, especially like the Mad Catz one, you know, the Mojo thing,
6194000	6201000	where it just is Google Play Store, and you just put your games on there, and it works on the TV,
6201000	6206000	and games that don't support controllers, you can map stuff to it. It just works, and there's plenty of content out there.
6206000	6208000	You don't need a specialized marketplace for it.
6208000	6215000	So, why spend the money on an Ouya when you can just spend your money on something else that works a lot better?
6216000	6219000	And it's just like a lot of people have taken the Ouya concept and made it better.
6219000	6225000	And that's... unfortunately, there's not really anything. They can't just put out another Ouya right now, you know.
6225000	6230000	It's going to be very interesting to see where the Ouya ends up in about six months, right?
6230000	6231000	Yeah.
6231000	6232000	So, we'll see.
6232000	6237000	Alright, anyhow, moving on to another news story about a game you're not going to be able to get on the Ouya,
6237000	6240000	but probably about everywhere else. Disney Infinity.
6240000	6244000	And, you know, Disney Infinity, of course, has Toy Box, which is like the creation mode,
6244000	6247000	which, you know, makes me kind of think at first about, like, LittleBigPlanet.
6247000	6251000	I didn't realize, really, how powerful this is until I saw this video.
6251000	6257000	And in this video, somebody basically recreated Super Mario Brothers 1-1.
6257000	6263000	And what's weird to me about this video is that, like, isn't this, like, an official type of, like, trailer or whatever?
6263000	6264000	Yeah.
6264000	6270000	Yeah, well, what's interesting about this is that they actually show, like, there's the little staircase with Buzz Lightyear going to a flagpole,
6270000	6273000	and it's like, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
6273000	6275000	Isn't level 1-1 kind of...
6275000	6277000	It's not similar with LittleBigPlanet 2.
6277000	6282000	Yeah, I guess that's true. And to be fair, it's just one small component that you see in the video here.
6282000	6284000	But still, wow, it looks very powerful.
6284000	6288000	And are you going to be able to share these across the internet and all that good stuff?
6288000	6289000	I'm sure you will be able to.
6289000	6290000	Yes. Yes, you will be able to.
6290000	6292000	This is going to be an interesting game. Interesting player.
6292000	6294000	I've already seen some of the next characters come out, too.
6294000	6295000	Oh, yeah? Like what?
6295000	6297000	Like, they've got, uh...
6297000	6304000	Like, well, they've, I mean, it's not stuff that's new because they've shown them in the trailers already.
6304000	6307000	But, like, well, perfect example right here.
6307000	6310000	You know, they're going to have the stuff from Wreck-It Ralph.
6310000	6314000	They're not going to have a Wreck-It Ralph playset, but they're going to have a Wreck-It Ralph.
6314000	6320000	They're going to introduce a new thing. It's like, instead of the playsets, it's a toy box set.
6320000	6327000	Basically, it's the characters and you get pieces for the toy box instead of, you know, an actual playset.
6327000	6331000	They're going to have a Toy Story 1 coming out, Jack Skellington around the same time.
6331000	6339000	And then, uh, I think in the Toy Story 1, it's Buzz Lightyear and...
6339000	6343000	Because I haven't watched Toy Story 2, it's the female cowboy.
6343000	6344000	Or, I can't remember.
6344000	6345000	Jessie.
6345000	6349000	Jessie. So, it's going to be Buzz and Jessie and then Woody sold separately.
6349000	6353000	So, um, it looks fun.
6353000	6355000	Buzz has Jessie and no Woody.
6355000	6361000	Yeah, well, it's just, they had to, they always put a female character in there because they want the appeal.
6361000	6363000	Well, except for the starter pack. It's all males.
6363000	6369000	But, like, for, like, cars and stuff, they have, like, they try to put a female character in there so that girls will buy it, too.
6369000	6372000	You know, so they can play as the girl characters and stuff like that.
6372000	6373000	Yeah.
6373000	6378000	But, yeah, it looks fun. I mean, it's expensive. I just don't...
6378000	6380000	Yeah, it's going to be an expensive hobby.
6380000	6382000	I don't want to buy all those characters.
6382000	6386000	Any word about, like, exclusive figures only at parks or things like that?
6386000	6390000	I haven't heard of anything yet. I mean, they haven't really said that they're going to do stuff like that.
6390000	6394000	It might come later on, like, next year. I mean, assuming this all takes off.
6394000	6398000	Um, I know Skylanders does that. They have exclusive characters for Toys R Us and stuff.
6398000	6402000	But, usually, they're just recolored characters and stuff.
6402000	6403000	Alright.
6403000	6405000	Dark Sakura.
6405000	6407000	Sorry, I got tangled.
6407000	6409000	And not in a fun way, either. You know.
6409000	6418000	So, anyway, um, we've talked a little bit about the Oculus Rift thing, about how kind of creepy it can be, and kind of weird.
6418000	6419000	Creepy awesome.
6419000	6420000	Yeah.
6420000	6428000	Well, there is a Japanese sex game that will be, uh, bringing out Oculus Rift support.
6428000	6430000	Nice.
6430000	6437000	The game is called Custom Made 3D, and it basically lets you create a maid that you can play with.
6437000	6442000	And it comes with a controller called the Juicy Air Support.
6442000	6446000	It's like a move controller, but it, um, isn't, uh...
6446000	6447000	It's a flashlight controller.
6447000	6449000	Yes, it is. So, thank you.
6449000	6454000	Um, so now, even though the game's been out for a little bit, it's, uh, got Oculus Rift support.
6454000	6461000	So, you can, uh, get your action a little bit more up close and personal.
6461000	6463000	Yeah.
6463000	6465000	Right.
6465000	6468000	Hey. Cut an edge.
6468000	6471000	Alright, whatever you're into, have fun with that.
6471000	6473000	Whatever sinks your battleship.
6473000	6476000	It's just that whole thing. Look, we've talked about this on the show before, right?
6477000	6482000	Which is for time to penis, which is usually, which usually is about peripherals.
6482000	6488000	And that is, how long will it take when they release this peripheral for someone to stick their dick in it?
6488000	6489000	Or, how long will it...
6489000	6490000	They already had that.
6490000	6494000	Or use their custom creation stuff. Like, for example, Disney and Fendi.
6494000	6497000	How long will it take for someone to create a giant phallus in their toy box?
6497000	6500000	Ten seconds. You know? Like, that's, that's...
6501000	6504000	Here's another, you know, further proof of that.
6504000	6506000	So, this great new technology comes out.
6506000	6510000	How long before somebody figures out how to work in wieners and boobs?
6510000	6515000	I'm sure this isn't necessarily the first attempt either, as those development kits have been out for a bit.
6515000	6520000	Anyhow, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the mailbag. Low-key.
6520000	6526000	Alright. So, Nintendo is now working to draw some, um, indie support as well to the Wii U.
6526000	6529000	Alrighty, it's pretty easy to publish indie titles on the Wii U.
6529000	6533000	And you do see a lot of indie games coming to the Wii U, especially a lot of Kickstarter-backed stuff.
6533000	6536000	You'll see, like, hey, we're making a Wii U version of it as well.
6536000	6543000	Um, but, you know, there are some comments done by, um, some of these indie developers,
6543000	6547000	including, um, I guess Dacko Dacko is one of the studios.
6547000	6551000	They have a game called Scram Kitty and His Buddy on the Rails.
6551000	6553000	Or Buddy on Rails.
6553000	6555000	And, uh, that'll be coming to the Wii U.
6555000	6562000	They said, basically, they don't shout very loud about it, but they are working hard behind the scenes to make their platform as welcoming as possible.
6562000	6564000	I gotta see what the hell this game is.
6564000	6566000	Wow, that's kind of neat.
6566000	6569000	It's got a cat. It looks kind of evil.
6569000	6571000	It's a...
6571000	6573000	puzzle platformer?
6573000	6574000	Oh, neat.
6574000	6579000	Um, and then, of course, they were saying that, uh,
6580000	6586000	uh, former, uh, I can't even pronounce this guy.
6586000	6590000	Uh, this company, uh, Nam-Nam?
6590000	6591000	Where?
6591000	6593000	Nam-Nam. I think that's Nam-Nam.
6593000	6594000	Nam-Nam.
6594000	6596000	Nam-Nam. I'm gonna say Nam-Nam.
6596000	6598000	Nam-Nam.
6598000	6601000	Um, they're saying, you know, they focus quality over quantity.
6601000	6607000	Um, they're actively seeking indies, but they're looking for quality experience developers that can make,
6607000	6610000	maybe form a longer-term relationship.
6610000	6617000	Um, I guess they're bringing, uh, Tengami is the game they're bringing there.
6617000	6623000	And then, um, also they're talking about Dreamfall Chapters, the longest journey.
6623000	6629000	Um, that, uh, basically saying, you know, they approached them last autumn,
6629000	6636000	and immediately after Dreamfall Chapters was announced, they were, in fact, the first console manufacturer to do so.
6636000	6642000	Um, yeah. So, that's cool that they're supporting indies.
6642000	6648000	I mean, it's getting very interesting for indies, because now you have all these indie developers out there,
6648000	6653000	and, like, these, the console manufacturers are actively kind of seeking these guys out.
6653000	6658000	And that's gotta be exciting for a lot of people to get into development.
6658000	6662000	You know, it costs a lot to develop a triple-A game, and indie games,
6662000	6664000	not that they don't cost a lot to develop, because they do too,
6664000	6666000	but they're such a smaller scale.
6666000	6670000	And also there's a high potential for return on their investment.
6670000	6673000	This is exactly what happens in movies, right?
6673000	6676000	We've heard about these big-budget movies that have kind of flopsied, right?
6676000	6683000	Like, we had the, um, uh, God, there was the, um, the Turbo, the animated film that just came out.
6683000	6685000	The Lone Ranger.
6685000	6691000	Yeah, the Lone Ranger. The Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges movie, really tanked too, that just came out, like, last week.
6691000	6692000	R.I.P.D.
6693000	6696000	And, you know, some of these companies are having to take big losses on these,
6696000	6700000	and that's why a lot of movie companies really prefer to find these low-budget movies
6700000	6706000	that don't cost a lot of money, that, that make hundreds of times back their budget sometimes.
6706000	6709000	Like, remember there's something about Mary? That movie?
6709000	6714000	That was a huge profit for that company that put that out there, because that movie probably cost-
6714000	6717000	The Blair-Wench? Or, the Blair-Wench project?
6717000	6719000	That was a porno, you sick fuck!
6719000	6721000	But that had a high return on investment as well.
6721000	6725000	You know, if they want Ryan Reynolds to do a movie that's gonna make money, just hurry up and do Deadpool.
6725000	6726000	Right?
6726000	6729000	The Blair-Wench project, though, that was, um, huge.
6729000	6730000	That's another good example.
6730000	6732000	Not so much for the sequel, but, you know, it was huge for the first one.
6732000	6736000	And I've been hearing a lot of buzz around this indie movie, the, uh, Fruitvale Station,
6736000	6740000	which, you know, maybe that's because I'm in Northern California, but it's based on some very unfortunate events
6740000	6744000	that happened in Northern California, but that apparently is getting a lot of buzz,
6744000	6747000	that it's, you know, a great movie, and it's probably gonna make a ton of money at the box office,
6747000	6752000	and was made relatively on the cheap, too, so, I mean, you know, it's-
6752000	6754000	Here's a good example. Clerks.
6754000	6758000	Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely. Pretty much any movie that guy makes, although not all of them-
6758000	6759000	Except for Jersey Girl.
6759000	6761000	And, uh, Mallrats. Yeah, not all of them-
6761000	6762000	Mallrats was great!
6762000	6765000	But, it was a good movie, but it didn't profit, really.
6765000	6769000	Not all of his movies profit, unfortunately. So, anyhow.
6769000	6772000	I don't know how we got on that tangent, I guess because about, like, indie games, you know,
6772000	6775000	there's a potential for better return on investment there, so-
6775000	6776000	I know exactly how it happened.
6776000	6777000	Mm.
6777000	6781000	Because the same thing also happens in the movie industry. For example-
6782000	6788000	Oh, I totally forgot this movie came out this weekend. Tiger Class said he saw The Wolverine.
6788000	6792000	The Wolverine came out this week and did really well at the box office. It literally made back its budget.
6792000	6794000	Wanna see it.
6794000	6795000	I do, but-
6795000	6797000	It looks so terrible, too, and that's kinda-
6798000	6801000	Hey, as an 80s Wolverine reader, we're forgiving.
6801000	6805000	The weird thing to me is that I thought they already made a Wolverine movie.
6805000	6806000	They did.
6806000	6809000	I mean, I guess this is, like, a sequel or whatever, or a different direction.
6809000	6812000	This is taking on the whole Wolverine in Japan arc.
6812000	6814000	But it's the same guy. It's so weird to me.
6814000	6816000	He's- I don't care. He's pretty.
6816000	6819000	Hugh Jackman is a good actor, you know? Just on the general.
6819000	6820000	I want to pet him.
6821000	6823000	I don't know that his wife would like that, but I care.
6823000	6824000	Of course you do. Of course you do.
6824000	6829000	Alright, moving on. I'm sure some of you guys saw this crazy video that was out there on the internet this week,
6829000	6833000	where some folks were driving a car with a Nintendo controller.
6833000	6840000	Now, obviously, there are limits to this, but cables that connect the controller to the electronic unit inside the car,
6840000	6844000	a 2010 Ford Escape, and a Toyota Prius.
6844000	6852000	This is a project funded by DARPA, and it's to raise awareness about over-reliance on computer systems and vehicles.
6852000	6856000	One of the researchers, who goes by Charlie Miller, said,
6857000	6863000	We would love for everyone to start having a discussion about this, and for manufacturers to listen and improve the security of cars.
6863000	6866000	I don't know if that's how most people are taking this. I think most people are looking at it going,
6866000	6869000	Cool! It's Mario Kart for real!
6869000	6871000	Meanwhile, we have operator-less cars.
6871000	6872000	Yeah, that's true.
6872000	6876000	Oh god, I saw one of those Google cars on the freeway once. Did I tell you about that?
6876000	6877000	But somebody was at the wheel.
6877000	6881000	I kind of always thought, though, that maybe even though the cars are driving themselves,
6881000	6885000	somebody's probably right there, ready to take over the car, just in case.
6885000	6887000	Like driver school or something.
6887000	6893000	There was a neat one where, basically, they had a blind girl sitting in the driver's seat.
6893000	6897000	So, you know, with her hands on the wheel and everything, even though the car was doing the work,
6897000	6902000	for her, it was like a giddy moment, being blind all of her life and being behind the wheel of a car.
6902000	6907000	But it sounds like, to me, it's like cruise control, just cruise control with GPS navigation.
6907000	6913000	Well, they also have directional sensors and, what's the word I'm thinking of,
6913000	6918000	locator to check for items around them, echolocation sensors, I think.
6918000	6923000	Alright, well that brings us to the mailbag.
6923000	6928000	And every week you guys can email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6928000	6932000	Dark Soccer will dive in the mailbag head first and hopefully she won't find me anthrax.
6932000	6939000	But she will find, I was talking about an 80's metal band, but she will find some excellent emails.
6939000	6943000	If it's anthrax and a public enemy, sign me up.
6943000	6947000	Alright, she will find some of your emails to read here live on air.
6947000	6951000	Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com. Please feel free to email us.
6951000	6954000	Unless you are a spammer, in which case you can fuck right off.
6954000	6955000	You can fuck off and die.
6955000	6956000	That's right.
6956000	6962000	We actually have had a last minute, looks like an email that came after the show last week.
6962000	6968000	It said, I emailed earlier but forgot to ask, is it possible that for the FUs of the week
6968000	6971000	you could play the old Final Fantasy Advent Children's Saffiroth theme?
6971000	6972000	I miss it so bad.
6972000	6975000	That should be badly, by the way, that's an adverb.
6975000	6977000	Thanks again, Ricimo.
6977000	6979000	What do you say? Should I try to dig that up and give this guy his wish?
6979000	6980000	Sure.
6980000	6982000	Why not? Alright, I'll dig that up while you read the email.
6982000	6985000	Only if you use adverbs correctly in the future.
6985000	6988000	It's not so bad, it's so badly.
6988000	6991000	This is a conditional granted request.
6991000	6993000	We're having some faith in you.
6993000	6995000	Don't say, I want that so bad.
6995000	6996000	We believe in you.
6996000	6997000	I want that so badly.
6997000	6999000	We believe in you, but don't you dare let us down.
7002000	7003000	Alright.
7003000	7004000	Awful.
7005000	7007000	Please call me Serger.
7007000	7008000	Okay, Serger.
7008000	7009000	Hi, O.L.R.
7009000	7012000	I know Dark Soccer has been having house buying drama.
7012000	7014000	God knows shit, especially today.
7014000	7016000	So I thought I'd encourage her with my own success story.
7016000	7018000	Or make me jealous, I don't know.
7018000	7020000	I'm a long-term mentor and have been saving for a home,
7020000	7023000	but I needed that final push to start the arduous home buying process.
7023000	7026000	This spring I was playing Animal Crossing Wild World on my 3DS XL,
7026000	7029000	and paying my loan to Nook, and it hit me.
7029000	7031000	I should be paying off a mortgage for reals.
7031000	7033000	Long story short, I'm closing on house on August 19th.
7033000	7036000	Next I plan on getting married after playing Harvest Moon.
7036000	7038000	You gonna get a cow?
7038000	7040000	Wait, is this for real or is this kind of troll?
7040000	7042000	Like, I don't know.
7042000	7043000	Like, I kind of...
7043000	7044000	Like, you seriously...
7044000	7046000	Well, sometimes people have aha moments.
7046000	7047000	I guess that's true.
7047000	7049000	I'm sorry if I called you a troll,
7049000	7051000	but it's just kind of amusing to me
7051000	7053000	that, like, you know, you played Animal Crossing
7053000	7056000	and you realized, wow, I should go get a house for real.
7056000	7059000	But then the whole, I should go get a girlfriend for real.
7059000	7060000	That's where I'm starting to go.
7060000	7061000	Is this a troll?
7061000	7062000	You know what? It's funny.
7062000	7067000	I was actually visiting Queen Simia's town a couple weeks ago,
7067000	7070000	and we were talking about paying off the mortgages,
7070000	7071000	and I was like...
7071000	7074000	And she made some comment, like, wouldn't it be a lot better
7074000	7076000	if the real estate market was like this for real?
7076000	7079000	I was like, I wouldn't have this problem right now if it did.
7079000	7083000	If this was a troll, though, this was a great troll, so I, uh...
7083000	7084000	A plus.
7084000	7085000	A searcher.
7085000	7086000	Yeah.
7086000	7087000	Who we have seen in chat.
7087000	7088000	Yes, I do recognize the name. I do.
7088000	7090000	This says, hey, y'all.
7090000	7091000	Hey.
7091000	7092000	Hi.
7092000	7094000	This is from Ospher.
7094000	7095000	Oh, God, this is long.
7095000	7097000	Stop it. Stop.
7097000	7099000	In the weeks following this year's E3 showing,
7099000	7102000	I sought out other video game podcasts to listen to,
7102000	7103000	in addition to yours, of course.
7103000	7104000	Good.
7104000	7106000	While I did enjoy some of the other shows I heard,
7106000	7108000	I came to the realization that the host of OLR
7108000	7111000	is what truly gives it a solid advantage over the rest of the competition.
7111000	7112000	Yes, we do.
7112000	7113000	Aw, sucks.
7113000	7116000	You have three hosts, each with very different backgrounds,
7116000	7120000	and each of which cover a different social aspect and identity.
7120000	7122000	I love what each personality brings to the table as well,
7122000	7124000	and I love your grammar.
7124000	7127000	Loki, while often funny, yet ranty voice of the show
7127000	7129000	plays an important role of speaking openly his thoughts
7129000	7131000	on what a lot of gamers might have on their minds,
7131000	7133000	but might not have the balls to speak it.
7133000	7136000	His rants are welcome, at least by myself.
7136000	7138000	He's got an amazing head on his shoulders,
7138000	7144000	and shows that he's very knowledgeable about the industry as a whole.
7144000	7147000	These rants only happen because he's a guy that truly cares
7147000	7149000	about the games and the gamers who play them.
7149000	7151000	You know, DarkSakura, logging mails are okay when they exist
7151000	7153000	to inflate our egos a little bit.
7153000	7154000	Yes, thank you.
7154000	7155000	Keep going, sir. Keep going.
7155000	7157000	Hey, it's the part about me next.
7157000	7159000	DarkSakura is a bitch.
7159000	7161000	No.
7161000	7163000	No.
7164000	7167000	DarkSakura is a very admirable host due to her ways
7167000	7169000	in which she approaches deep gaming discussions,
7169000	7171000	or discussions on any topic for that matter.
7171000	7173000	Are you saying I get off topic?
7173000	7177000	While sometimes she may be quiet for the initial talk between Robin and Loki,
7177000	7180000	you can tell she has been gathering her thoughts to make some great points.
7180000	7183000	No, she hasn't. She's been catching bugs.
7183000	7186000	I turned off Animal Crossing in the middle of Bobby's show
7186000	7188000	just because I had a visitor at 5 o'clock.
7188000	7190000	I've been crocheting the whole time, but I've been listening.
7190000	7193000	Her penis cozy is now like a boa constrictor cozy.
7193000	7195000	That's how long she's been doing.
7195000	7198000	You're really going to have a limited target demographic with that one.
7198000	7201000	You know what? I'm going to say this.
7201000	7204000	It helps me concentrate to have something to do with my hands.
7204000	7207000	And as a corporate trainer during the day,
7207000	7209000	I can actually say that as like some people,
7209000	7211000	when they are actually like moving their hands,
7211000	7213000	it's very like they actually learn more.
7213000	7214000	That's why they encourage...
7214000	7216000	It's called kinesthetic learning.
7216000	7217000	Oh, I know.
7217000	7220000	I like it. One meeting when I was working for the student loan place
7220000	7223000	and they put out Legos to see if we retained more by playing with Legos.
7223000	7226000	I built a little tower, but I remembered more.
7226000	7229000	Anyway, where was I? More stuff about me.
7232000	7233000	Okay.
7234000	7236000	She's just been gathering her thoughts to make some great points
7236000	7239000	and also quick to point out something the other hosts may have missed.
7239000	7242000	She's an awesome listener and I really admire her desire to understand
7242000	7244000	what others may have trouble communicating,
7244000	7247000	such as the incident of an angry email the show received
7247000	7250000	that Basch and other hosts close to the OLR family.
7250000	7253000	Even through that, she calmly read through and restated the point
7253000	7255000	the email was trying to get across gaming-wise
7255000	7258000	and that was pretty freaking awesome that she even gave it the chance.
7258000	7259000	Well, thank you.
7260000	7263000	You were a saint for giving that email a chance, but yes.
7263000	7264000	Okay.
7264000	7266000	And then there's Rob.
7266000	7268000	No, then there's that guy.
7268000	7271000	Some may say he's the glue that holds the show together.
7271000	7273000	Others may poke fun at him for making flappy hands
7273000	7276000	while taking a single shot of some sort of alcohol.
7276000	7278000	I'm on my second glass of wine and I'm holding up just fine.
7278000	7281000	Yeah, but it's not burning your face off like the fireball.
7281000	7283000	No, the fireball was really...
7283000	7284000	I can smell that.
7284000	7287000	That and the, um, what was the other stuff we had that one night?
7287000	7288000	Oh, God.
7288000	7289000	Yeah, anyway.
7289000	7292000	Sorry, let's not turn this into a liquor discussion.
7292000	7293000	Okay.
7293000	7296000	Rob never has a one-way mentality towards any gaming issue
7296000	7300000	and he will always play devil's advocate to try and see things from both sides.
7300000	7304000	He's never too serious, but he's serious when it is warranted
7304000	7306000	and he's always there to listen to a gamer's plea for help
7306000	7308000	or just help others in general.
7308000	7311000	Tonight, I'm going to come to him for some advice.
7311000	7312000	Uh-oh.
7312000	7313000	Rob.
7313000	7314000	Yes?
7314000	7317000	As a gay gamer, you've certainly felt what it's like to be pressured by your family
7317000	7319000	before coming out to them.
7319000	7321000	You must know what it's like to have them wondering
7321000	7324000	why you aren't trying to find a girlfriend or to feel that pressure
7324000	7327000	that you have to please them by giving them grandchildren one day.
7327000	7330000	At least you might have felt that until you came out to them.
7330000	7331000	How did you do it?
7331000	7334000	I asked because very recently I was on a walk with my dad.
7334000	7337000	He's very conservative, often scoffing at any gay issue
7337000	7340000	when he sees it comes up in the news.
7340000	7343000	Yet when I showed him concerns about my uncle telling us that you choose to be gay
7343000	7346000	and if you are gay you're going to hell, obviously this isn't true
7346000	7349000	and when I told him that I had sour feelings toward him because of it,
7349000	7351000	he said you shouldn't hate someone because of something they said.
7351000	7353000	They might just be uninformed.
7353000	7357000	After this he followed up with you can be whoever you can be with whoever you want with
7357000	7359000	as long as it makes you happy.
7359000	7362000	I don't care what you want to do with your life as long as it satisfies that.
7362000	7365000	Should I just tell my parents that I'm gay?
7365000	7369000	I know this is a tough question but I don't know anyone better to come out to
7369000	7371000	about this except for yourself.
7371000	7375000	I'll make my decision based on what you tell me following this email.
7375000	7377000	Sincerely, Oscar.
7377000	7380000	P.S. Really sorry this email is a bit long.
7380000	7381000	I just need some thoughts out there.
7381000	7382000	Can I say one thing?
7382000	7383000	Please.
7383000	7385000	Usually your parents know.
7385000	7388000	Actually this is what I was going to get to as well.
7388000	7392000	This is a very heavy email and not about games but I'm all about
7392000	7397000	there's more to gaming than the games themselves if that makes sense.
7397000	7399000	You can't have the games without the players, right?
7399000	7404000	Right. So let me, yes I will tackle this issue here and help this guy out
7404000	7407000	because he's clearly asking for it.
7407000	7410000	What Dark Soccer just said to some extent is true.
7410000	7412000	There's a good chance they already know.
7412000	7415000	And that's a good indication based off what your dad said.
7415000	7419000	And you know when I came out to my parents I was very fortunate
7419000	7422000	that I had a fairly positive-ish reaction.
7422000	7428000	You know my mom was upset for about a day but never at me.
7428000	7430000	She blamed herself because she felt it was her fault.
7430000	7434000	She felt she, and I think she had the whole thought about grandchildren
7434000	7436000	and so forth but she wised up to it.
7436000	7438000	I mean the year is 2013.
7438000	7439000	It's a different world we live in now.
7439000	7443000	Even though you're gay that doesn't mean you can't have kids.
7443000	7447000	It's just you don't have kids the same way other people have kids.
7447000	7451000	You adopt or you have the surrogate mother or whatever.
7451000	7453000	There's tons of options out there.
7453000	7455000	So just because you're gay doesn't mean you can't have kids.
7455000	7457000	So get that out of your mind first off.
7457000	7464000	Second off, my parent, my mom actually asked me when around the time I was 20
7464000	7466000	she would ask me almost every day.
7466000	7468000	Like it really got bad during one summer.
7468000	7470000	Like, are you gay? Are you gay? Are you gay?
7470000	7473000	And suddenly one day I finally just kind of like, I just had my fill of it.
7473000	7476000	I was like, yes, dammit, leave me alone type of thing.
7476000	7478000	And we kind of had like that blow up discussion.
7478000	7480000	But you know things were fine.
7480000	7483000	I know the first thing she did was she called my grandma
7483000	7484000	who has since passed away.
7484000	7486000	May she rest in peace.
7486000	7490000	Because the first thing my grandma said when my mom said Rob's gay
7490000	7494000	is my grandma said, so what?
7494000	7496000	Which is a great thing.
7496000	7499000	I realize though that I'm very fortunate in that regard
7499000	7502000	where I have a very cool supportive environment
7502000	7504000	and not everybody is so lucky.
7504000	7506000	Like your uncle sounds like a bit of a knob.
7506000	7509000	You know, unfortunately you may not get that same level of support from him.
7509000	7513000	The point I wanted to get at though is that the reason why my mom escalated
7513000	7517000	in asking me the question is that apparently unbeknownst to me
7517000	7521000	I had a female friend stay the night at my place once while I was in college.
7521000	7525000	And she called her parents to ask if it was okay to stay over.
7525000	7528000	And she said, even though she was kind of whispering on the phone,
7528000	7531000	she said, no it's fine. He's gay. Nothing's going to happen.
7531000	7533000	My mom overheard that conversation.
7533000	7539000	So she already knew and she was waiting for me to tell her.
7539000	7542000	And she said later on, she's like, you know, I've always suspected
7542000	7544000	since you were younger.
7544000	7549000	I'm not a big fan of that because I don't think that certain behaviors
7549000	7553000	are indicative of certain sexuality.
7553000	7556000	Speaking in this whole larger discussion about gender norms
7556000	7561000	and, you know, being effeminate and gay is not necessarily the same thing.
7561000	7563000	There's plenty of effeminate guys who are very straight.
7563000	7566000	There's plenty of, you know, I don't know what you would call it.
7566000	7569000	But don't use the fucking term straight acting with me
7569000	7571000	because I hate that shit.
7571000	7573000	There's no such thing as straight acting.
7573000	7575000	Everybody little bit gay.
7575000	7577000	Here's a good example of someone who you look at
7577000	7581000	and you might not see the gaydar set off with who's John Barriman.
7581000	7584000	Okay, true. So here's the thing.
7584000	7587000	Is it possible your parents have come across something
7587000	7589000	that maybe they already have this indication
7589000	7591000	and they're waiting for you to tell them?
7591000	7595000	Now, I think as far as you telling them, that is really up to you.
7595000	7598000	You know best when the right time to tell them is.
7598000	7601000	I think sometimes there's a lot of pressure in the gay community
7601000	7603000	to be like, come out, come out wherever you are.
7603000	7606000	Come out. Get out of the closet.
7606000	7609000	I'm a little bit more of the mindset of that is a little bit more
7609000	7611000	of a utopian view of where we should be.
7611000	7615000	But it is quite frankly dangerous in some areas to do that.
7615000	7619000	So my advice to you is if you are out on your own
7619000	7621000	and living on your own and doing your own thing
7621000	7623000	and making your own choices, then guess what?
7623000	7625000	You get to live your own life.
7625000	7627000	And I think yeah, I think it might be a good time
7627000	7629000	for you to tell your parents about this.
7629000	7632000	Especially if you get this indication that they already know.
7632000	7634000	But if you're still living at home
7634000	7638000	and there's the chance there could be an ugly backlash,
7638000	7640000	you need to have a backup plan if you're going to tell them.
7640000	7642000	Just in case.
7642000	7645000	And I pray to you that you don't have to use it.
7645000	7648000	And I really hope that you don't have to use that plan B.
7648000	7650000	But it is the smart thing to do.
7650000	7652000	Just in case.
7652000	7656000	But if they did already know, it might have already been ugly.
7656000	7661000	So, you know, I really have to say like I can't sit here,
7661000	7665000	Oscar, and say yes do it or no don't do it.
7665000	7666000	Because guess what? I don't know your parents.
7666000	7667000	I don't know your life.
7667000	7670000	I don't know the way you conduct yourself on a day-to-day basis.
7670000	7672000	You really know the answer to this question.
7672000	7676000	But if you're in a place where your life where you can be your own person,
7676000	7678000	then I say you know what?
7678000	7680000	Go ahead and tell them.
7680000	7684000	But, you know, remember your friends,
7684000	7689000	your real friends will always support you through this no matter what.
7689000	7691000	That's the most important thing.
7691000	7693000	So, and I will say this.
7693000	7696000	I don't want to get into this too much on a video game podcast.
7697000	7701000	I did, in my mind, I did lose a brother to this issue.
7701000	7703000	He's still alive and all that stuff.
7703000	7704000	We don't speak.
7704000	7706000	I haven't spoken to him for a very long time.
7706000	7709000	And it is partially because of this issue.
7709000	7713000	And there will be some tough decisions you have to make along those lines.
7713000	7714000	But you know what?
7714000	7717000	I may have lost a brother there,
7717000	7722000	but I have made so many other close male friends
7722000	7725000	that like honestly I would consider brothers.
7725000	7729000	That are more brothers to me than my, my,
7729000	7730000	it's complicated.
7730000	7731000	He's actually adopted.
7731000	7732000	But my biological.
7732000	7733000	The one you grew up with.
7733000	7736000	Well, not even that because he was 14 when I was born.
7736000	7740000	So, but my, my mother brother will say that.
7740000	7745000	I feel closely to these guys than I do my mother brother.
7745000	7748000	So anyway, that's my very long winded answer.
7748000	7750000	Sorry for the folks that were here to listen to the games,
7750000	7752000	but maybe you were curious.
7752000	7753000	I don't know.
7753000	7755000	Well, you know, and it's.
7755000	7759000	He might be the only person out there having that same sort of thought too.
7759000	7763000	So if it benefits somebody, then by all means, ask the difficult questions.
7763000	7764000	Yeah.
7764000	7766000	So, um, and you know what, if you're,
7766000	7769000	if you're straight out there listening to this and you know,
7769000	7770000	maybe you don't, you know,
7770000	7774000	take this little feedback I'm giving to us for here as maybe like a little bit
7774000	7776000	of perspective.
7776000	7780000	Like maybe this is why we need an event like gamer X,
7780000	7783000	because a lot of people respond to something like gamer X going, well,
7783000	7787000	when's the straight gaming convention. Okay.
7787000	7791000	Well when your parents kick you out of your house for being straight and you
7791000	7793000	get persecuted by society for that,
7793000	7797000	and you are treated as a second class citizen and people pass laws
7797000	7799000	against the way you are.
7799000	7800000	Look at Russia right now.
7800000	7802000	You can get your fucking con.
7802000	7803000	Yeah.
7803000	7806000	These are the same people ask when we have white pride month.
7806000	7810000	But yeah, some people need a safe place.
7810000	7814000	Thank your white privilege that you have a safe place.
7814000	7815000	Yeah.
7815000	7817000	That's all I'm going to say. And I'll get off my soap box.
7817000	7819000	I swear to God that shit pisses me off though.
7819000	7821000	Where do I get my straight pride parade?
7821000	7823000	You get it every single fucking day.
7826000	7827000	So next email.
7828000	7829000	Yes please.
7829000	7830000	Okay.
7830000	7833000	Um, this is a rageinator.
7833000	7835000	Hi, Loki, dark soccer, and Rob. It's your friendly neighborhood.
7835000	7838000	Rageinator provided that there is enough time in tonight's show.
7838000	7841000	I'd like to propose that you do something akin to combining listless
7841000	7842000	and classic game of the week.
7842000	7844000	Why not come up with a definitive top 10 list of classic games that
7844000	7845000	people should play?
7846000	7847000	You know, it's funny.
7847000	7850000	I don't think we've ever done like listless on the very obvious topics
7850000	7851000	such as this one.
7851000	7855000	Uh, listless is always kind of for the silly stuff, but, um,
7855000	7856000	why not?
7856000	7857000	Why not?
7857000	7858000	Not tonight.
7858000	7861000	Maybe like as an OLR special sometime we'll run down like 30 classic
7861000	7864000	games, 10 each or something that you ought to be playing.
7864000	7866000	Although we do, we do have the classic game of the week built in every
7866000	7867000	week.
7867000	7869000	We also do kind of have March Madness, which is, yeah.
7869000	7870000	Oh yeah.
7870000	7873000	Um, uh, I always want to say DMM, but it was Bresl's thing.
7873000	7874000	Right.
7874000	7878000	So, um, but I liked your idea maybe for other topics.
7878000	7881000	Like we need to do more like special shows and one off things.
7881000	7882000	So it'd be fun.
7882000	7883000	Yeah.
7883000	7884000	Well, um,
7886000	7889000	I think that's, let me check and see if there's any more emails.
7889000	7890000	Um,
7890000	7891000	in Korean.
7891000	7893000	No, it's in Mandarin, but what's this one?
7893000	7894000	Oh, there's a thank you mail.
7894000	7895000	Yay.
7895000	7896000	Oh, wow.
7896000	7897000	This is okay.
7897000	7898000	We got one more.
7898000	7899000	Good thing I checked, isn't it?
7899000	7900000	Yay.
7900000	7902000	Dear OLR, I wanted to send you a quick email to thank you for putting on a
7902000	7903000	great show for so many years.
7903000	7907000	We don't always agree, but I always enjoy listening to OLR and I look
7907000	7910000	forward to the next gen discussions that will take place once we get the
7910000	7912000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox one in hand.
7912000	7915000	I look forward to the day when we can separate facts from fiction and
7915000	7919000	conversations will be steered toward how fun NAC is or how I lapped Black
7919000	7920000	Wolf in fours of five.
7920000	7924000	I also look forward to adding everyone to my friends list on Xbox Live and
7924000	7927000	PSN once the friends cap is raised with these new systems.
7927000	7930000	I know everyone likes to think I'm an Xbox fan boy,
7930000	7933000	but I am truly looking forward to experiencing what Sony and Microsoft
7933000	7937000	have to offer us over the next five years or so,
7937000	7940000	as well as what Nintendo will be bringing to the table as well.
7940000	7944000	Hopefully I can accept Rob's invitation to visit OLR in person at some point
7944000	7946000	since I only live a few hours away in Fresno.
7946000	7947000	Yes.
7947000	7948000	So sorry.
7948000	7950000	Keep up the great work, Shadow Next Gen.
7950000	7953000	When I ran into him at E3, I was like, you live in Fresno.
7953000	7955000	Why don't you drive up sometime?
7955000	7958000	We had a dude from Bakersfield come up and do the MS walk with us.
7958000	7960000	If he can do that, you can do this.
7960000	7962000	So yes, open invite, Shadow Next Gen.
7962000	7964000	Come on over sometimes and thank you for the email.
7964000	7965000	And I'm sorry for Fresno.
7967000	7969000	It's halfway to Disneyland. Think of it that way.
7969000	7971000	No, it's near the Bravo Cheese Farms.
7971000	7973000	What about the good things that Fresno did?
7973000	7975000	I went to a Weird Al concert.
7975000	7976000	That was cool.
7979000	7980000	Alright, thank you very much for the emails.
7980000	7981000	Haha, Bobby.
7981000	7982000	What?
7982000	7984000	Shadow Next Gen, you shut up about your fours a-lapping.
7986000	7987000	Alright.
7987000	7988000	Well, thank you very much.
7988000	7990000	There were some really kind emails tonight.
7990000	7991000	You guys rule.
7991000	7993000	Even though we got a little heavy with one of those emails,
7993000	7994000	it was a good discussion.
7994000	7995000	So you guys rule.
7995000	7997000	Alright, so speaking of emailers,
7997000	8000000	we shall grant the wish of one of our emailers tonight
8000000	8002000	and bring on the FUs of the Week
8002000	8005000	with an old-school song from Orange Lounge Radio,
8005000	8006000	what we used to use for the FUs of the Week.
8006000	8007000	It has my stabby part in it.
8007000	8008000	Here we go.
8008000	8009000	With murder.
8009000	8010000	Yes.
8010000	8011000	Here we go.
8011000	8012000	It's the FUs of the Week time.
8022000	8025000	My FU goes towards losing that house.
8025000	8028000	We had been told we lost the house,
8028000	8030000	but it turns out that it had actually been an old message,
8030000	8033000	so we thought we got it, and it turns out we didn't.
8033000	8037000	So there's a very selfish, spiteful part of me
8037000	8040000	that still hopes that there's one way we can get it,
8040000	8042000	but it's back to looking.
8042000	8045000	We may talk to a house flipper.
8045000	8048000	So back to the hunt.
8048000	8051000	Just ready to be done.
8051000	8054000	I'm ready to be in any place.
8054000	8056000	And an FU to my nerves,
8056000	8058000	because I'm pretty sure that my job is going to be awesome.
8058000	8060000	Everybody there was awesome.
8060000	8062000	All the stuff that goes with it is awesome.
8062000	8067000	I'm just a little nervous because I don't want to fuck this up.
8067000	8070000	Loki.
8070000	8074000	That's just FU death.
8074000	8078000	FU the fact that all my coworkers are gone.
8078000	8081000	All the coworkers that used to play for me,
8081000	8082000	those are gone.
8082000	8084000	That's my boss.
8084000	8087000	I kick his ass every day.
8087000	8088000	Call of Duty.
8088000	8091000	And it's just like...
8091000	8093000	And half the time he doesn't even want to play
8093000	8096000	because he's got errands to run.
8096000	8099000	Or the coworker has errands to run.
8099000	8103000	I don't even take breaks anymore.
8103000	8106000	Because why bother walking over there with a flake
8106000	8107000	and buy myself a bottle of coffee?
8107000	8108000	Because it's a law.
8108000	8109000	You have to take a break.
8109000	8110000	Are you hourly or salary?
8110000	8111000	I'm hourly.
8111000	8112000	You're supposed to take a break.
8112000	8113000	I'm supposed to.
8113000	8115000	You're breaking the law.
8115000	8116000	I take...
8116000	8120000	To quote the argument sketch from Money Python,
8120000	8124000	I could be choosing to argue in my spare time.
8124000	8125000	Whatever.
8125000	8127000	So yeah.
8127000	8129000	There's no point in me walking over to the game room
8129000	8132000	to try to play an Xbox Live game
8132000	8136000	because our live connection is absolute shit
8136000	8138000	and we get disconnected all the time.
8138000	8146000	It's because we're on 20 gigs down to the whole company.
8146000	8150000	It's like my internet running a hundred computers.
8150000	8152000	It's not going to happen.
8152000	8154000	So yeah.
8154000	8156000	That's it.
8156000	8157000	Alright.
8157000	8158000	Let's see.
8158000	8159000	My FU of the week.
8159000	8162000	One goes to stress.
8162000	8165000	Because stress will just drive people insane.
8165000	8167000	Stress will fuck up your body.
8167000	8169000	Stress sucks.
8169000	8171000	So I'm going to give an FU to stress.
8171000	8174000	And it's not necessarily me just going through stress
8174000	8176000	but I just see the impact it has on other people
8176000	8178000	and it's never any fun.
8178000	8180000	So I want to also say that FU did the fact
8180000	8182000	that Video Games Live was in San Francisco
8182000	8184000	on Thursday and Friday.
8184000	8186000	And I didn't go because I was so busy
8186000	8187000	with so much other stuff going on this weekend.
8187000	8189000	I didn't go.
8189000	8191000	So I'm kind of irritated at that.
8191000	8192000	I really wanted to go
8192000	8196000	and it just wasn't going to work out for me this year.
8196000	8198000	But I do want to give a thank you.
8198000	8199000	I want to give a thank you.
8199000	8201000	Should I give some thank you music here?
8201000	8202000	Let's see.
8202000	8205000	Go back to the hippy dippy classic game of the week music here.
8205000	8208000	I want to give a thank you to Brad from Pod Culture.
8208000	8211000	Well not only is he pretty much just an awesome guy.
8211000	8213000	He's helped out Horde House and so forth
8213000	8215000	and you all should be listening to Pod Culture.
8215000	8216000	But he said here in chat,
8216000	8218000	you never have to apologize for the tangents,
8218000	8220000	serious or funny.
8220000	8223000	They are a part of you guys and thus a part of gaming
8223000	8225000	and why we tune in.
8225000	8227000	So.
8227000	8228000	Shucks.
8228000	8230000	I just had a big smile.
8230000	8231000	Thank you guys.
8231000	8232000	Many hearts.
8232000	8233000	To all of you.
8233000	8234000	Thank you to all of you.
8234000	8235000	Not just Brad,
8235000	8237000	but Brad needs to share his thanks with all you guys
8237000	8238000	that tune in every week,
8238000	8241000	be it live or podcast form.
8241000	8242000	Aw shucks.
8242000	8243000	You made it this far in the show.
8243000	8245000	You're awesome.
8245000	8247000	Gold star for you.
8247000	8248000	All right.
8248000	8250000	Let us move on, shall we?
8250000	8251000	Loki.
8251000	8254000	All right.
8254000	8256000	So this is kind of interesting.
8256000	8258000	It's kind of a culmination of a lawsuit
8258000	8259000	that's been in the works for a while.
8259000	8264000	You may remember the original creator of Madden
8264000	8267000	was filing a lawsuit against E.A.
8267000	8270000	for some royalties that were unpaid
8270000	8277000	between, you know, 1990 and, you know, 1996.
8277000	8280000	Didn't they find out there were more monies due too?
8280000	8283000	I don't know if this is the same situation,
8283000	8285000	but apparently he got $11 million.
8285000	8286000	So.
8286000	8287000	So, yeah.
8287000	8291000	And great for him, I guess.
8291000	8294000	Finally, the Madden games are good for something.
8294000	8297000	So basically, the jury found that the games released
8297000	8300000	during that time were virtually identical to the original.
8300000	8301000	Ha ha ha.
8301000	8304000	This is like the Wii version of the game now.
8304000	8307000	See, and, you know,
8307000	8310000	the original version of Madden NFL Football
8310000	8312000	developed by Antonyc
8312000	8316000	and basically saying that they,
8316000	8319000	you know, I guess the Antonyc and his attorneys
8319000	8321000	will seek to appeal previous rulings
8321000	8324000	that exclude the Super Nintendo games
8324000	8328000	and fraud claims from the jury deliberations.
8328000	8332000	So I think they are still gonna try to seek some more money,
8332000	8337000	but right now $11 million isn't nothing to shy away from.
8337000	8340000	So that's pretty cool.
8340000	8341000	All righty.
8341000	8343000	Maybe he can buy himself a new game studio
8343000	8345000	for that amount of money.
8345000	8347000	Hey, Atlas is on the table.
8347000	8348000	There you go.
8348000	8355000	You might be able to pick up an Atari IP while you're at it.
8355000	8357000	Moving on.
8357000	8359000	This is really sad news, actually.
8359000	8361000	It kind of sucks.
8361000	8363000	Do you remember that Darkstalkers
8363000	8365000	was set to make this big return
8365000	8367000	and we had Darkstalkers Resurrections
8367000	8368000	came out recently, right?
8368000	8369000	Yeah.
8369000	8373000	Well, here's a quote from Capcom product manager Matt Dahlgren.
8373000	8376000	Darkstalkers Resurrection did not perform as well
8376000	8378000	as we would have liked to perform.
8378000	8383000	There is nothing Darkstalkers on the immediate horizon for sure,
8383000	8386000	meaning if you were looking forward to Darkstalkers 4,
8386000	8389000	you'll be waiting a little bit longer,
8389000	8392000	and it's all because you didn't support Darkstalkers Resurrection.
8392000	8394000	This is basically all your fault.
8394000	8395000	It's because we hate you
8395000	8398000	as much as we hate the people like Mega Man.
8398000	8400000	So, but enjoy Dead Rising 3.
8400000	8401000	Please look forward to it.
8401000	8403000	And look forward to Strider.
8403000	8405000	Now, actually, you know what?
8405000	8406000	You know what?
8406000	8411000	If I had to send Darkstalkers off for a Viking funeral
8411000	8413000	and never see it again,
8413000	8415000	to trade it for another Strider game...
8415000	8416000	Hell yeah!
8416000	8418000	I'm okay with that, to be honest.
8418000	8420000	Yeah, but okay, let's look at all the games
8420000	8422000	that they've decided to put out again
8422000	8425000	or make new versions of or something,
8425000	8427000	versus Mega Man.
8428000	8432000	We've had the Dungeons & Dragons arcade games.
8432000	8434000	Final Fight.
8434000	8436000	Final Fight's good, but...
8437000	8439000	DuckTales.
8440000	8441000	Strider.
8441000	8442000	And the problem is?
8442000	8443000	The problem is,
8443000	8445000	I mean, DuckTales, while good and everything,
8445000	8447000	it's not Mega Man.
8447000	8449000	Why can't we get a new Mega Man?
8449000	8451000	I mean, I guess we got Mega Man 9 and 10,
8451000	8453000	but we need more Mega Man.
8453000	8455000	You're still making Dead Rising games,
8455000	8456000	and those aren't that great.
8456000	8459000	I think Strider trumps it.
8461000	8463000	I have no interest in the Strider game.
8463000	8467000	All right, well, going to the chatroom
8467000	8469000	at live.vognetwork.com,
8469000	8470000	ActDef says,
8470000	8471000	No, no, fuck Strider.
8471000	8472000	I want new Darkstalkers.
8472000	8473000	And BlackWolf says,
8473000	8475000	I want new games not based on old IP.
8475000	8477000	Ugh, haters.
8477000	8478000	Let's see.
8478000	8480000	Also, ShadowNextGen says,
8480000	8482000	and before I open up the phones at 1877 Game OLR
8482000	8484000	or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio,
8484000	8485000	all one word,
8485000	8486000	ShadowNextGen says,
8486000	8488000	There was some fairly big Activision news that is happening.
8488000	8489000	I'm surprised no one has mentioned it,
8489000	8490000	at least not yet.
8490000	8493000	You know it did mysteriously not make the show roll.
8493000	8495000	I guess nobody posted it,
8495000	8498000	and I forgot about it amongst all the other craziness going on.
8498000	8499000	Oh, about them buying themselves back.
8499000	8500000	Yeah, about the whole buying themselves back.
8500000	8503000	And I remember we saw the signs kind of leading up to it
8503000	8505000	with the whole Vivendi's looking to unload.
8505000	8507000	So, yeah, quickly, let's bring that up.
8507000	8508000	They basically bought themselves.
8508000	8510000	Yeah, they bought themselves back.
8510000	8512000	Well, what does that really mean, though, Loki?
8512000	8513000	It means that...
8513000	8514000	Eight billion.
8514000	8516000	They paid eight billion for themselves.
8516000	8520000	They bought out the shares that Vivendi owned.
8520000	8522000	Now, Vivendi still owns part of it.
8522000	8525000	It's 12% of the company versus, I guess,
8525000	8527000	a controlling share or something, but...
8527000	8528000	Over 50%.
8528000	8530000	Yeah, so they basically bought that stuff back.
8530000	8532000	There's also another...
8532000	8535000	Some Asian company also put some money down.
8535000	8538000	I think they have, like, the Call of Duty online game
8538000	8541000	in China or something.
8541000	8543000	They put some money down, too, as well.
8543000	8544000	That's part of that.
8544000	8548000	But, yeah, so basically they bought out that person's,
8548000	8552000	or that company's shares of their company,
8552000	8554000	and now they have the controlling shares again.
8554000	8555000	Some folks in the chat room are saying,
8555000	8558000	Activision is now an independent company.
8558000	8560000	I don't know if I'd go that far.
8560000	8563000	Would you consider Activision games indie games at this point?
8563000	8564000	I'm not sure.
8564000	8566000	I mean, what is an indie game, I guess?
8566000	8567000	I always think of an indie game
8567000	8569000	as like something dudes in a basement wrote.
8569000	8570000	It's usually low budget.
8570000	8571000	Yeah, yeah.
8571000	8572000	So I don't know if I'd go that far.
8572000	8574000	I want that as a game, dudes in a basement.
8574000	8579000	But it's more interesting to see what's gonna develop from this.
8579000	8582000	I mean, from a financial investing stock side,
8582000	8584000	it's fascinating, but I'm waiting to see, like,
8584000	8587000	does change in policy come from this?
8587000	8589000	Because the management's not gonna change.
8589000	8590000	The CEO doesn't change.
8590000	8592000	Just means they make more money at the end of the day
8592000	8593000	because more of that...
8593000	8594000	Maybe they don't have to answer
8594000	8596000	to a greater board of directors.
8596000	8597000	That's the one thing that gets cut out.
8597000	8600000	We can raise the prices of the games again.
8600000	8602000	The prices of the games again, yes!
8602000	8604000	Or maybe make some big decisions
8604000	8606000	to take World of Warcraft free to play
8606000	8607000	or whatever they gotta do.
8607000	8610000	So it'd be interesting.
8610000	8611000	All right.
8611000	8612000	Well, if you want to call in and talk about this,
8612000	8613000	the Activision split,
8613000	8615000	or anything else we've talked about this week on the...
8615000	8617000	or this week, yeah, this week tonight on the show,
8617000	8619000	1877 Game OLR,
8619000	8622000	or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8622000	8625000	We're gonna open those phones right now for you to call in.
8625000	8628000	If you have anything you want to talk about at all,
8628000	8630000	you can do that right now.
8630000	8633000	Meanwhile, I will look for some last-minute stories.
8633000	8634000	I'm gonna go to Twitter as well,
8634000	8635000	see if there's anything on there.
8635000	8637000	But, Loki, DarkSakura,
8637000	8638000	either of you have some last-minute stories
8638000	8639000	you want to share?
8639000	8640000	No.
8640000	8641000	I mean, no.
8641000	8643000	My voice decided to die.
8643000	8644000	Fair enough. Loki?
8647000	8648000	No, I don't really have anything right now.
8648000	8649000	Holy moly!
8649000	8651000	It's a slow news week.
8651000	8653000	It was a little bit of a slow news week
8653000	8656000	when all that drama about the indie game
8656000	8658000	and all that kind of takes center stage.
8658000	8660000	I think that kind of tells you what kind of week it was.
8660000	8661000	But, okay, there's a few things
8661000	8663000	that the Twitter folks are sending us,
8663000	8665000	so let me read some of these tweets real quick,
8665000	8667000	and maybe some of you guys heard about these stories.
8667000	8670000	SSG100Matt says there was some punch-out-related news.
8670000	8673000	Apparently, Mike Tyson was caught by TMZ.
8673000	8676000	You know TMZ is that really trashy tabloid site
8676000	8678000	that, like, stalks celebrities at airports
8678000	8680000	and asks them really stupid questions?
8680000	8682000	Well, Mike, apparently one of those guys at TMZ
8682000	8683000	asked Mike Tyson,
8683000	8686000	Hey, how far can you get in Mike Tyson's punch-out?
8686000	8688000	Have you been able to beat yourself?
8688000	8689000	And he said that he sucks at it,
8689000	8691000	like he can't even get past the first guy.
8691000	8693000	Oh my god, that is so stupid.
8693000	8697000	Hey, Mike Tyson, what's your favorite brand of chips?
8697000	8698000	Hey, what kind of...
8698000	8700000	It's like, what kind of ice cream you like?
8700000	8703000	Is that really what they're approaching?
8703000	8705000	Well, you know, Loki, I think I like the Ruffles chips
8705000	8706000	because I don't have ears.
8706000	8708000	Is that like what they really like?
8708000	8710000	That was the worst impression by that.
8711000	8713000	Is that like what they're really doing
8713000	8715000	to celebrities nowadays, like stalking them,
8715000	8717000	to ask them really fucking stupid questions?
8717000	8718000	Have you looked at TMZ?
8718000	8720000	No, I have not.
8720000	8721000	Never, never.
8721000	8723000	It is the cesspool of the internet.
8723000	8726000	Like, if the Big Brother house is the cesspool of society,
8726000	8729000	then TMZ is the pooper in that house.
8729000	8731000	Yo, Mike, what do you think about the royal baby?
8731000	8732000	Who cares? Alright, look.
8732000	8733000	It's a baby.
8733000	8735000	Alright, look, we got a call.
8735000	8737000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8737000	8738000	I just want you to know,
8738000	8741000	I had to bite my tongue during that whole segment
8741000	8743000	so I wouldn't bust out in full laughter.
8743000	8745000	Did you like my impression?
8745000	8747000	Oh, God. You're just terrible, man.
8747000	8748000	Just terrible.
8748000	8751000	Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?
8751000	8753000	Not much. First, I want to say
8753000	8756000	the advice that you gave earlier in the podcast...
8758000	8760000	Oh, thank you. Thank you.
8760000	8761000	It means a lot.
8761000	8764000	It does, because I'm dealing with some similar issues.
8764000	8766000	I have to talk to you about that another time,
8766000	8769000	but I truly understand somewhat where you're coming from
8769000	8771000	with this and that, so...
8772000	8774000	But I actually called in to let you know
8774000	8777000	that I'm actually getting my replacement headset
8777000	8778000	from Astro Gaming.
8778000	8780000	Oh, that's right.
8780000	8782000	You're having all this drama with Astro Gaming.
8782000	8784000	For the new listeners, recap real quick.
8784000	8787000	Long story short, I was having issues
8787000	8788000	with the mixer and the headset,
8788000	8791000	and it took them maybe about several months
8791000	8794000	through various emails to try to get it fixed.
8794000	8797000	The mixer got replaced, the mic got replaced,
8797000	8798000	but not the headset.
8798000	8800000	That problem still persisted.
8800000	8803000	It's like the clouds in the sky parted
8803000	8804000	and the sun shone through,
8804000	8806000	and all these customer service issues
8806000	8807000	are getting fixed this week,
8807000	8809000	because Loki's finally getting his damn controller, too,
8809000	8810000	for the Ouya.
8810000	8812000	Well, allegedly, until that thing shows up.
8812000	8814000	Except it's coming from DHL,
8814000	8816000	so it'll be probably fired out of a cannon
8816000	8819000	across the Pacific Ocean and hopefully land.
8819000	8820000	I gotta get my Ouya back for me this week.
8820000	8822000	They're delivering by carrier pigeon.
8823000	8826000	That's because DHL packed it up and left.
8829000	8831000	They couldn't compete with FedEx and UPS.
8831000	8832000	They closed up several years ago.
8832000	8834000	It was just whatever's left.
8837000	8839000	Well, congratulations on getting
8839000	8841000	what you needed from the company.
8841000	8844000	It's a good, happy end to the story, we hope.
8844000	8846000	It took two phone calls.
8846000	8847000	The guy called me back.
8847000	8849000	I explained everything,
8849000	8851000	so they sent me a brand new 2013 kit.
8852000	8855000	And the appropriate cables for the new mixer.
8855000	8857000	Dark Tetsuya in our chat room,
8857000	8858000	sorry to go on a tangent here real quick,
8858000	8860000	but says about the whole Mike Tyson impression
8860000	8861000	I did earlier.
8861000	8863000	Rob should really get into VA work
8863000	8865000	after this OLR thing ends.
8865000	8867000	Dude, why do I have to wait for OLR to end?
8867000	8868000	You want OLR to end?
8868000	8869000	Fine.
8869000	8870000	Last show, everybody.
8870000	8871000	Bye.
8871000	8872000	No.
8872000	8873000	Not really.
8873000	8875000	That means Uchon gets started on OLR,
8875000	8876000	the Flash animated series.
8876000	8879000	Why does that have to be something we wait on?
8879000	8880000	You know what?
8880000	8882000	I did used to want to be a voice actor.
8882000	8883000	Yeah, the VA thing?
8883000	8885000	I would be so down with that.
8885000	8887000	Throw me a script, people.
8887000	8890000	I'm not very good at pursuing that stuff on my own
8890000	8892000	because I do have a day job and all that,
8892000	8895000	but it would be a dream to be a cartoon character
8895000	8896000	or something, you know?
8896000	8898000	So, absolutely.
8898000	8902000	Throw an idea my way and I'd be happy to do it.
8902000	8904000	Even if it's just a little cameo.
8904000	8906000	Even if I have to play derpy hooves or whatever,
8906000	8908000	I'll do it.
8908000	8911000	Anyhow, what else is going on with you, Rama?
8911000	8912000	What else in gaming?
8912000	8914000	What have you been playing lately?
8914000	8916000	You might get mad if I tell you the game
8916000	8918000	I've been playing for the last week,
8918000	8919000	the last several weeks.
8919000	8920000	Try me.
8920000	8921000	Sailor Moon S Fighting Game.
8921000	8923000	No.
8923000	8925000	I've been playing Candy Crush Saga.
8925000	8926000	Oh, God.
8926000	8928000	Judgingyou.com.
8928000	8930000	I'm judging you times two.
8930000	8931000	Actually, is that a site?
8931000	8932000	I don't know.
8932000	8935000	This is coming from people who play Warcraft and FF11.
8935000	8938000	This is coming from people who play Warcraft and FF11.
8938000	8940000	For shame, good people.
8940000	8941000	For shame.
8941000	8942000	Okay, look.
8942000	8944000	Bobby told us to hang up on you.
8944000	8948000	We're not gonna because we have some tolerance, but still.
8948000	8950000	Judging.
8950000	8953000	Wow, somebody has Judgingyou.com
8953000	8955000	and it says it's currently under construction.
8955000	8957000	It looks like a web page from 2005.
8957000	8960000	And now we're judging you, Judgingyou.com.
8960000	8962000	Yeah, I'm totally judging you, Judgingyou.com.
8962000	8964000	All right, anyhow.
8964000	8968000	Candy Crush Saga, what stage are you on in Candy Crush?
8968000	8970000	315.
8970000	8972000	Holy shit!
8972000	8974000	How much have you spent?
8974000	8975000	None.
8975000	8976000	Wow, okay.
8976000	8977000	I am kind of impressed.
8977000	8978000	You know, I blocked that today.
8978000	8982000	Some of those levels are pretty fucking impossible without buying power-ups,
8982000	8985000	so applause to you, my friend.
8985000	8986000	No, no applause,
8986000	8990000	because I'll be the first one to admit that I cheated on half those levels,
8990000	8991000	and you know what?
8991000	8996000	Even with all the extra power-ups, the game is still kicking my ass.
8996000	9001000	Even with power-ups, I was stuck on the same level for a solid week.
9001000	9003000	How do you...
9003000	9005000	How do you...
9005000	9007000	Sorry, I got confused with a little tweet here.
9007000	9009000	How do you...
9009000	9011000	You said you cheat.
9011000	9013000	Yeah, how do you cheat in Candy Crush when it's an online game?
9013000	9015000	I play on my tablet.
9015000	9017000	And believe it or not, even though it's an online game,
9017000	9022000	there are ways to access the Facebook app through third-party applications.
9022000	9023000	Oh, okay.
9023000	9025000	All right, gotcha, gotcha.
9025000	9027000	All right, well, thanks for the call, Rama.
9027000	9029000	I'm going to let you go and try to get some more calls, okay?
9029000	9031000	No problem, and stay fabulous, darling.
9031000	9033000	I will, always.
9033000	9034000	You got it.
9034000	9035000	Stay black.
9035000	9036000	Black.
9036000	9037000	You got it!
9037000	9039000	All right, bye.
9039000	9043000	And for anyone, that's been a long-running inside joke on the show,
9043000	9044000	just to be clear.
9044000	9045000	It was from Dan.
9045000	9047000	It's something that Dan started, which was hilarious.
9047000	9049000	Because my husband's a dooper.
9049000	9051000	Well, he didn't know what else to say in that moment,
9051000	9053000	so it was just really funny when he said that.
9053000	9055000	All right, anyhow,
9055000	9057000	BlackWolf in our chatroom says,
9057000	9061000	I'm sad to report that Candy Crush Jam Session has been cancelled.
9061000	9063000	Oh, I didn't let poor Rama plug Anime Jam Session.
9063000	9065000	Well, you should listen on Tuesday nights.
9065000	9068000	All right, let's go back to the phones.
9068000	9070000	1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype,
9070000	9073000	Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
9073000	9075000	Otherwise, I still have some more tweets for you guys.
9075000	9078000	SGA100Matt did have a second Punch Out tweet for us,
9078000	9079000	and that is,
9079000	9081000	A Gaming Did You Know?
9081000	9083000	The title theme to Punch Out came from Gillette's
9083000	9087000	Cavalcade of Sports 1950 intro.
9087000	9089000	And Bobby Blackwell followed that up with,
9089000	9091000	it actually was one of Gillette's theme songs,
9091000	9092000	very famous back then.
9092000	9094000	Here's Boston Pop's version,
9094000	9096000	and a whole bunch of YouTubes were linked.
9096000	9100000	So, you know, a lot of gaming songs kind of end up getting inspired by
9100000	9102000	stuff that's out there in popular culture.
9102000	9103000	Jairus.
9103000	9105000	I was just talking about one of my favorite
9105000	9107000	Commodore 64 games today on Game Buoy,
9107000	9109000	and I won't tell you what game it is.
9109000	9111000	You'll have to listen to their show to find out.
9111000	9115000	But it has a whole stage named after a popular song from the 80s,
9115000	9119000	and actually the little music in the stage was kind of inspired by that song.
9119000	9121000	It's all based on Whitney Houston.
9123000	9124000	All right.
9124000	9126000	I watched a video today of Left 4 Dead 2 mods
9126000	9129000	that had Whitney Houston as a playable character.
9129000	9131000	Oh my, that's terrible.
9132000	9133000	That's terrible.
9134000	9136000	Again, she's putting a shout out there for some phone calls,
9136000	9137000	Orange Launch Radio,
9137000	9138000	all one word on Skype,
9138000	9139000	or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9139000	9142000	Rob, remember when we used to make the RIP names in WoW?
9143000	9145000	Yeah, I still have RIP Betty White,
9145000	9146000	just for the day.
9146000	9148000	And I, you know, again, guys.
9148000	9149000	I had RIP Whitney.
9149000	9152000	I love that woman, and I don't want that to happen,
9152000	9155000	but when it does, I'll be ready.
9155000	9156000	You know what I still had?
9156000	9157000	Rebecca Black.
9158000	9160000	She was like max level at one point, wasn't she?
9160000	9161000	She's 85 right now.
9161000	9162000	Actually, no, she's 86.
9164000	9166000	Hey, you can always start Final Fantasy XIV
9166000	9167000	and have Rebecca Black Mage.
9169000	9170000	I actually like that.
9170000	9171000	That's really funny.
9171000	9172000	You know what, maybe I'll do that.
9172000	9173000	Rebecca Black Mage.
9173000	9175000	I'll make like a human character in XIV
9175000	9177000	and do Rebecca Black Mage.
9178000	9179000	I love that.
9179000	9181000	I was going to name my Final Fantasy XIV character,
9181000	9184000	because originally my little Tarot Tarot
9184000	9186000	was named Lil Poundcake,
9186000	9188000	which if you watch RuPaul's Drag Race,
9188000	9189000	you'll understand why,
9189000	9190000	which was great,
9190000	9194000	but now I think I'm going to have a character, a human,
9194000	9196000	because Shane's convinced me I need to play a human.
9196000	9198000	I think I'm going to name her Lisa Turtle
9198000	9200000	after one of my favorite Saved by the Bell characters,
9200000	9202000	because Lark Vuharis is a hot mess now.
9202000	9204000	You want to know what's funny?
9204000	9206000	I've managed to get Homestuck names.
9206000	9207000	Oh, yeah?
9207000	9208000	On the busiest server.
9208000	9209000	Nice.
9209000	9210000	And no one else had them.
9210000	9211000	So I was like, heck yeah.
9211000	9212000	Heck yeah.
9212000	9213000	So is Skype working, y'all?
9213000	9214000	Poke, poke.
9214000	9215000	I'll give it a few more minutes,
9215000	9216000	but if nobody else calls in,
9216000	9218000	I guess we'll call it a show.
9218000	9220000	We do have a few tweets from Tigerclaw, however.
9220000	9224000	Disney registers some Star Wars Attack Squadron domains.
9224000	9226000	Hmm.
9226000	9228000	Possible announcement for later.
9228000	9232000	And PlayStation 4 devs can only use 4.5 gigabytes
9232000	9235000	of the system's 8 gigabyte RAM.
9235000	9237000	Isn't that kind of common, though,
9237000	9240000	that a big chunk of RAM is eaten up by the system itself?
9240000	9241000	But think about it.
9241000	9243000	The PlayStation's going to be recording,
9243000	9244000	and I bet the Xbox One has a similar story.
9244000	9245000	It's the same thing.
9245000	9246000	It's recording while you play.
9246000	9249000	Once again, though, I think it was this week.
9249000	9250000	It could have been last week,
9250000	9253000	because all these goddamn weeks merged together.
9253000	9256000	But seriously, what does that mean?
9256000	9257000	It means nothing.
9257000	9259000	That's just a headline to get some hits.
9259000	9260000	It's just like on IGN.
9260000	9261000	They had a headline.
9261000	9265000	Hey, the FCC report came out from PlayStation 4.
9265000	9267000	I think even the Xbox One.
9267000	9270000	We now know what the operating temperature is going to be.
9270000	9274000	Who the fuck cares what the goddamn operating temperature
9274000	9275000	of a console is going to be?
9276000	9278000	It makes, it's nothing.
9278000	9281000	It's just another article they can get some fucking hits
9281000	9282000	on their website for.
9285000	9286000	It's ridiculous.
9286000	9289000	But yeah, I mean, we don't know what the hell that means.
9289000	9291000	I don't think it means anything.
9291000	9292000	So what?
9292000	9294000	Because I bet you anything with three fucking
9294000	9297000	operating systems on the goddamn Xbox One,
9297000	9298000	there's going to be a good chunk of that
9298000	9301000	that's going to be dedicated to those.
9301000	9303000	However, there was a rumor I saw
9303000	9306000	that they're going to allow some of that for indie developers.
9306000	9308000	But I think all that stuff is just being pulled out
9308000	9309000	of someone's ass.
9309000	9311000	I mean, no one knows what the hell is going to happen.
9311000	9313000	And it doesn't matter in the end of the day
9313000	9315000	because there wasn't that much RAM on the Xbox 360
9315000	9316000	or PlayStation 3.
9316000	9321000	So there's some pretty good games on those consoles.
9321000	9323000	I don't think it's a big deal.
9323000	9325000	We'll just play the games.
9325000	9326000	Who gives a shit about the specs?
9326000	9327000	Just play the games.
9327000	9328000	They're good.
9328000	9329000	Cool.
9329000	9331000	How the magic's done, no one cares.
9331000	9332000	All right.
9332000	9333000	We do have another call coming in.
9333000	9334000	So let's go to it.
9334000	9335000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Day.
9335000	9336000	Who's this?
9336000	9337000	Hi.
9337000	9338000	This is Raging Aider.
9338000	9339000	Hey, Raging Aider.
9339000	9340000	What's on your mind, buddy?
9340000	9341000	Not much.
9341000	9342000	Yeah.
9342000	9347000	I just thought I'd call in with two very quick topics
9347000	9350000	just in case someone else wants to call in.
9350000	9351000	Sure.
9351000	9352000	Yeah.
9352000	9355000	Although the first topic is probably more appropriate
9355000	9359000	for an anime jam session because obviously they talk about anime.
9359000	9364000	But we have a series called Gunslinger Girl.
9364000	9365000	Mm-hmm.
9365000	9371000	Well, for those that haven't heard of it,
9371000	9372000	it's an anime series.
9372000	9376000	It's two seasons long plus it has two OVAs.
9376000	9381000	It basically centers around an agency in Italy.
9381000	9385000	It has a social welfare front.
9385000	9391000	It's really like a spy CIA type of agency in reality.
9391000	9393000	It involves cyborgs.
9393000	9399000	I'm probably not doing the series justice by describing it,
9399000	9403000	but needless to say, it's a very excellent series.
9403000	9410000	So for those that haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a while
9410000	9414000	and you like the anime or are at least somewhat interested in the anime,
9414000	9416000	I suggest watching it.
9416000	9417000	Wait.
9417000	9419000	Was there a question in there somewhere?
9419000	9426000	Well, it's not so much a question but a recommendation.
9426000	9427000	No.
9427000	9428000	Okay.
9428000	9429000	It's all good.
9429000	9430000	I thought you said it was a question.
9430000	9431000	I think I'll just watch Dollhouse.
9431000	9432000	Yeah, no.
9432000	9433000	Sorry.
9433000	9434000	It sounds interesting.
9434000	9435000	It was more crazy in my part.
9435000	9436000	No, that's all right.
9436000	9438000	I just don't watch a lot of anime, but not that it's bad.
9438000	9439000	I don't dislike it.
9439000	9443000	I just hardly watch any TV at all because I'm always playing video games.
9443000	9446000	But it sounds cool.
9446000	9450000	I'll add that to my ever-growing list of shit to catch up on.
9450000	9458000	Well, it's probably one of those series that is probably really great
9458000	9461000	for those that don't watch a whole lot of anime.
9461000	9466000	It's like an entry-level anime.
9466000	9471000	It's one of the first series I watched and I still love it.
9471000	9474000	That makes me so incredibly sad to hear that.
9474000	9475000	Really, it does.
9475000	9477000	Why is that?
9477000	9482000	Because I remember my introductions to anime were classics like
9482000	9488000	Ranma and Devil Hunter Yoko and then watching
9488000	9492000	RoboTek when I was a little kid and Voltron and all that.
9492000	9497000	Technically, I did see RoboTek a few episodes out there when I was a kid,
9497000	9500000	but I really don't remember too much of it.
9500000	9504000	And I wasn't even sure if Voltron qualified as anime or not.
9504000	9506000	As far as I know, there was American Made.
9506000	9507000	Well, it was Matt Cross.
9507000	9509000	It definitely qualifies.
9509000	9510000	Oh.
9510000	9513000	Well, then I stand corrected.
9513000	9514000	All right.
9514000	9518000	Well, anyway, just to switch gears so I can hurry this call up to keep
9518000	9520000	someone who calls in.
9520000	9526000	But as you may or may not be aware, in case you haven't seen me on
9527000	9534000	Scheme, I finally got into the Civ games, both 4 and 5,
9534000	9537000	and basic Black Wolf.
9537000	9539000	And I'm loving them.
9539000	9545000	And I was thinking, you know, although I kind of brought it up briefly,
9545000	9549000	Dollar Day when you were doing the Noob Nights on Borderlands 2,
9549000	9555000	one of these days we all should have like a VOD MIDI night on Civ 5,
9555000	9558000	maybe get like a pretty decent game going.
9558000	9563000	I don't know what the maximum number of players are for Civ 5.
9563000	9564000	I think it's 8.
9564000	9565000	I think.
9565000	9566000	Don't quote me on that.
9566000	9567000	All right.
9567000	9568000	Yeah.
9568000	9572000	You know, since I guess that's one of the game's play on Steam is,
9572000	9574000	from what I can tell, pretty proper,
9574000	9578000	we should probably get like a community night going on there.
9578000	9581000	I would be totally down with that because Civ 5, I agree with you.
9581000	9582000	It's so awesome.
9583000	9587000	That can't be kind of pulled out of our butt the day of,
9587000	9589000	like we did Borderlands night,
9589000	9592000	the night we finally figured out we were both available.
9592000	9596000	Civ 5 night has to be planned in advance because Civ 5 night will go for 12 hours,
9596000	9598000	especially with eight people playing.
9598000	9603000	Like even if there's noobs, the problem is one person can really hold up those games.
9603000	9608000	So everybody has to be well versed enough in Civ to keep the game moving.
9608000	9611000	It would be one thing for like just Shane and I to play
9611000	9614000	because like he hasn't played at all so he has to learn.
9614000	9616000	So, you know, that could kind of move at one pace.
9616000	9617000	But if eight of us are going to play,
9617000	9621000	we all need to be relatively familiar enough with the game to keep it moving
9621000	9626000	because otherwise, like we're going to need 120 hours to play that fucking game.
9626000	9627000	Yeah.
9627000	9629000	I'll be first to admit that, you know,
9629000	9635000	I'm not on the same expert level as saying like you or, you know,
9635000	9637000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
9637000	9639000	Put the car apart.
9639000	9642000	Wait, wait. Put the car apart because I am by no means an expert at Civ.
9642000	9644000	I'm actually quite bad at it.
9644000	9647000	I don't have the strategical mind it takes to play a game like that.
9647000	9649000	But I'm just saying you don't have to necessarily be good,
9649000	9655000	but you just have to be able to move relatively fast and not get yourself held up.
9655000	9657000	Yeah, yeah.
9657000	9664000	Well, I was going to say I'm not as good as some of the other people in the bot community,
9664000	9670000	but, you know, ever since playing the game for the first time during their free weekend,
9670000	9673000	I've certainly got a whole lot better.
9673000	9678000	So, but for those that don't already have the game,
9678000	9684000	either Civ IV or Civ V on Steam already,
9684000	9686000	I definitely recommend getting those games.
9686000	9688000	They're really, really great.
9688000	9690000	You missed the hell out during the Steam sale, to be honest,
9690000	9693000	but hopefully it'll be on a flash sale again in the coming weeks.
9693000	9695000	Yeah, hopefully.
9695000	9697000	Well, I'll let you go.
9697000	9700000	I'm sure you're probably going to want to give more calls or wrap up the show,
9700000	9702000	but I'm glad I'm talking to you.
9702000	9703000	All right. Take care, Spaznator.
9703000	9704000	Good to hear from you.
9704000	9705000	I'm glad I'm talking to you too.
9705000	9706000	Bye.
9706000	9707000	Bye.
9707000	9708000	All right.
9708000	9710000	I always appreciate an endorsement for Civ.
9710000	9713000	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9713000	9716000	We'll give about one more minute, see if any other calls come in.
9716000	9717000	Did I do all the tweets?
9717000	9722000	I think I did the last one there because that was from Tigerclaw about the,
9722000	9724000	oh, yeah, the partial system RAM,
9724000	9727000	and we were kind of talking about other systems and that whole thing.
9727000	9728000	Oh, excuse me.
9728000	9730000	But that was it for tweets.
9730000	9732000	But if you want to send us a tweet in a future week,
9732000	9734000	twitter.com slash OLR,
9734000	9736000	and if you want to send us an email for a future week,
9736000	9740000	of course, that address is mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9740000	9743000	I do not see the phone ringing here,
9743000	9745000	and we are out of last-minute news, right?
9745000	9748000	So I think we got to close up shop.
9748000	9749000	That's it. I'm going to go ahead and close.
9749000	9751000	We're having a big discussion on the old-school anime now.
9751000	9752000	Oh, are you?
9752000	9753000	Like what?
9753000	9755000	Like Ronda just brought up Devil Hunter Yoko,
9755000	9757000	which is one of my favorite old series.
9757000	9761000	Well, actually, it was good through like the first three OAVs.
9761000	9765000	But like we have talk about, you know,
9765000	9767000	like the most depressing stuff like Dog of Flanders
9767000	9770000	and watching certain episodes of Galaxy Express 3-9.
9770000	9774000	And, you know, we're going back to the 70s and the late 60s now
9774000	9777000	for our references. So it's pretty cool.
9777000	9779000	But I have to say that one of my favorite of all time,
9779000	9781000	80s dirty pair.
9781000	9782000	Heck yeah.
9782000	9783000	All right.
9783000	9785000	Well, I guess I'll close up the Skype line
9785000	9786000	since nobody else was calling in.
9786000	9788000	But thank you to those that did call in.
9788000	9790000	And if you do want to comment on the show,
9790000	9792000	mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,
9792000	9794000	or of course tweets and Facebook.
9794000	9797000	As a reminder, we will be off next week
9797000	9799000	since I will be out of town.
9799000	9802000	So, you know, and plus we just we haven't had a week off in a while.
9802000	9804000	Sometimes we want a freaking vacation.
9804000	9807000	So I believe Bobby is still here live though at the Voice Geeks Network.
9807000	9809000	So please still tune in to support him.
9809000	9812000	And all the other shows that air on the network throughout the week.
9812000	9815000	We'll be back in two weeks.
9815000	9818000	Before we wrap it up, I do want to say thank you as always
9818000	9820000	for listening to our show and downloading the show.
9820000	9822000	We do do this for free.
9822000	9824000	We don't ask for your money unless, you know,
9824000	9826000	there's like a charity event going on or something.
9826000	9830000	But we just say, hey, tell a friend or two about the show.
9830000	9834000	Help spread the word about our show and just help help the family grow a little bit.
9834000	9837000	That's all we want. Help the oil army grow.
9837000	9840000	Meanwhile, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts
9840000	9842000	since we're closing up shop here.
9842000	9844000	Dark Sakura and your boa constrictor Cozy,
9844000	9845000	what is your final thought tonight?
9845000	9847000	I'm almost done with this thing.
9847000	9849000	But we also have other good references to other stuff like Zenki,
9849000	9851000	Record of Lodoss War.
9851000	9853000	Record of Lodoss War, by the way,
9853000	9855000	inspired one of my first D&D characters.
9855000	9856000	Oh, really?
9856000	9857000	Yes.
9858000	9861000	My final thought tonight is I had this Chex mix today
9861000	9865000	that's called Honey Nut, sweet and salty, and it's delish.
9865000	9867000	It's like the Honey Nut Cheerios mix they used to sell.
9867000	9870000	It's almost the exact same thing. Cool story, huh?
9870000	9872000	Loki, your last minute thought tonight or final thought.
9872000	9874000	I see Bobby's going back to play Saints Row IV.
9874000	9877000	You know what? I'm just going to go make my own Saints Row IV
9877000	9879000	with hookers and blackjack.
9879000	9881000	Well, maybe no blackjack.
9882000	9884000	Actually, I'm pretty sure Saints Row IV probably has hookers.
9884000	9886000	Maybe not so much blackjack.
9886000	9889000	Are you still going to do your game programming thing on a smaller scale
9889000	9890000	where you do a blackjack?
9890000	9894000	Because you could still make slutty blackjack or slutty breakouts.
9894000	9896000	You know, because there wasn't that much...
9896000	9898000	I would say there was not really very...
9898000	9900000	There was hardly any response.
9900000	9903000	Not a lot of positive response.
9903000	9905000	I'm just going to table it for now.
9905000	9907000	Just do something maybe on my own.
9907000	9909000	I think it's hard, too,
9909000	9912000	because the people out there have no frame of reference.
9912000	9915000	They don't really know what...
9915000	9917000	So you've got to kind of put something out there
9917000	9919000	before you're going to get any feedback whatsoever.
9919000	9921000	So you do you!
9921000	9923000	You do you on that.
9923000	9926000	That's fine. I had to play Borderlands the other day anyway.
9926000	9928000	So, you know, to level up.
9928000	9930000	Sometimes there's just more important things like Borderlands.
9930000	9932000	Why is it level up so I can play with you guys?
9932000	9934000	Alright, fair enough.
9934000	9936000	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9936000	9938000	Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
9938000	9941000	We will be back in two weeks with episode number 515.
9941000	9944000	I will see some of you next week at GamerX.
9944000	9946000	Please, if you do see me around the convention,
9946000	9948000	just come up and say hi. I don't bite, I promise.
9948000	9950000	I want to meet many of you while I'm there.
9950000	9953000	And for those that are not going to be in the area,
9953000	9955000	have a great week off.
9955000	9957000	Maybe I'll see you online gaming and so forth.
9957000	9959000	Don't forget we have a Steam community and some other communities as well.
9959000	9962000	And maybe this epic Civ night will have to happen at some point, too.
9962000	9964000	Have a great two weeks.
9964000	9966000	We'll see you next time here on Orange Launch Radio.
