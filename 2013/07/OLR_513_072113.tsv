7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight, July 21, 2013, a long-awaited Nintendo classic finally hits Wii U Virtual Console,
20000	27000	a dormant franchise re-emerges with a new game announcement at Comic-Con, and things get heated with one EA Sports franchise.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number 513, July 21, 2013.
44000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about all things video gaming
49000	52000	with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
53000	59000	And, of course, my co-hosts, not here right now, DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers, she is running a little late tonight.
59000	64000	She has more of those home buying, being an adult things that she's doing right now,
64000	68000	but she'll be joining us, hopefully momentarily, within the next 30 minutes or so.
68000	72000	But, in the meantime, joining me live in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
72000	74000	I'm working on a bag of three pounds of gummy bears.
74000	79000	I was going to say, you brought a lot of different stuff with you, fun things to the show tonight.
79000	85000	What are these things you brought to the studio with you? A giant package of Haribo gummy bears.
85000	91000	And not that I'm complaining, gummy bears are amazing, but that's three pounds. That's a lot of candy.
91000	97000	I will eat it until it makes me sick. It's one of these things, we had a coupon from our local grocery store
97000	100000	where you spend 50 bucks and you get 10 bucks back.
100000	106000	And so, I bought all of our groceries for the week, and they're pretty affordable as it is.
106000	112000	And so, I get to the counter and it's like, yeah, you have $47. I'm like, crap, I need something else.
112000	116000	I was like, okay, well, maybe I'll get some M&M's. Ah, they're the crappy pretzel M&M's.
116000	118000	Gummy bears!
119000	121000	So, you know, that kind of paid for itself.
121000	125000	There you go. Well, gummy bears are always exciting, and you know I'm going to steal some before the night is over.
125000	130000	So, you've kind of had a busy week, and before we get into our gaming weeks and all that stuff,
130000	133000	I want to talk to you about some of the variety of things that's gone on this week.
133000	137000	But, of course, I do want to introduce the always-present fourth guest in our show, the chat room.
137000	142000	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,
142000	149000	at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
149000	154000	And even though Bobby's opinion on games sometimes can be very wrong,
154000	162000	we do still support all our indie podcast friends, even when they don't agree with you that Super Metroid is the greatest game ever made.
162000	165000	I mean, geez, how can somebody not think that?
165000	169000	But, diversity, I suppose. We have to embrace a diverse environment.
169000	174000	It's fine. It's going to be the greatest game ever made up until Grand Theft Auto V comes out, and then, you know.
174000	178000	Things might change. You are trying to pressure me into the Grand Theft Auto V.
178000	183000	I might have to do it. You know, I've been taking a break from the MMOs lately,
183000	186000	because all my friends quit World of Warcraft, basically.
186000	191000	No, I shouldn't say all. I have some friends that play World of Warcraft still, but very few.
191000	195000	Like, I signed in for the first time today in, like, six days, and I had a bunch of friends that were like,
195000	197000	oh my gosh, where have you been?
197000	201000	But, I've been really able to catch up on a lot of single-player games, like Steam and stuff like that,
201000	206000	which I'll get into in my gaming week, but Grand Theft Auto IV is still sitting there on the list of things I need to do.
206000	208000	You need to play it.
208000	210000	Yeah, I know. I know I do.
210000	213000	Alright, going to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
213000	216000	Rambo wants to know, are they vodka-infused gummy bears?
216000	217000	No, not yet.
217000	220000	No, it's more like heat-infused gummy bears that have been sitting in my car.
220000	224000	And I've actually seen it before. What happens if they sit in my car for a very long time,
224000	228000	it will literally conform to the bag, and it'll be just one solid mass of gummy bears.
228000	235000	LokiLives46, I don't know if that's in reference to your name, or if you just both happen to be Loki,
235000	239000	but LokiLives46 says that's almost a gross amount of sugar, man.
239000	246000	I won't eat them all in one day, because it seriously, right now, it feels like I have a weight in my stomach.
246000	249000	Because I just finished eating dinner, and then I had this.
249000	252000	Well, gummy bears expand in your stomach, you know.
252000	253000	Oh, I didn't know.
253000	255000	No, I'm kidding. I don't know. I'm just messing with you.
255000	258000	Alright, so some of the other fun things you did with your week.
258000	263000	I love it when you bring presents to the show with you, and tonight you brought presents.
263000	271000	You brought this little Lego kit where you can actually build your own little, just tiny little Star Trek Enterprise.
271000	276000	It's one of those mini, it comes in like the plastic bag things, and you know, it's not too difficult.
276000	281000	I was building during Bobby's show, and well, not the whole thing, like the last ten minutes, I'm already almost done.
281000	284000	But where did you get this from, and what's been going on?
284000	288000	I got it from the Namco band I rep, because they came to my work this week.
288000	294000	We do this kind of, what used to be a game summit, now it's like an entertainment summit,
294000	300000	because they have a couple movie studios coming, now there's also the other things that we sell as well,
300000	305000	including Wonder Chalk, which is like this modeling chocolate stuff now.
305000	311000	So yeah, so they had a bunch of game companies out and stuff, and they show us what's coming out.
311000	316000	I got to see a few different, we'll talk about some of the stuff in gaming week I guess,
316000	321000	but I got to see a few different things. There's a few guys that brought dev kits with them.
321000	326000	Ubisoft brought Splinter Cell Blacklist, so I got to play a little of that.
327000	335000	Tecmo Koe, they brought Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z, so I got to play the E3 demo of that.
335000	342000	And I didn't actually play it, but Activision brought Skylanders, Swap Force.
342000	348000	I did fondle the toys a little bit, because there was no one at the booth at the time,
348000	353000	so I was looking at them, and the top and bottom halves are held together with magnets.
354000	358000	As you would expect, I guess. Very disappointed that Disney did not...
358000	360000	Magnets! How did they work?
360000	366000	I was very disappointed that Disney did not bring their Disney Infinity stuff.
366000	369000	They only had a video, which I've already seen.
369000	371000	And what else?
371000	374000	Well, it's neat that they were able to bring stuff to your work at all,
374000	377000	because there's other game stuff going on right now.
377000	381000	There's a lot of stuff going on at Comic Con, it seems even more gaming news this year than usual.
381000	386000	And then PAX Australia, which oddly haven't been hearing a lot coming out of PAX Australia.
386000	388000	I forgot it was even this week.
388000	391000	I don't think there was a lot of news to break.
391000	395000	I'm sure some great local news and some indie news that just hasn't shown up on my radar yet,
395000	398000	because I've been too obsessed with the Steam sale and Earthbound and all that.
398000	403000	But there hasn't really been a lot of news broken at PAX Australia,
403000	407000	but I'm sure it's been really cool for them to just experience PAX,
407000	411000	and getting all the nerds in one place and the big gaming rooms and all that.
411000	414000	But my favorite part about the whole thing was actually something that didn't even take place.
414000	419000	Well, it took place at the event, but more of the after event, like the dinner.
419000	421000	Okay, so I have a couple reps that work at different companies.
421000	425000	One guy, my friend Daniel, he's worked at a bunch of different companies.
425000	432000	I've known him since he's worked at Konami, Namco, he's working at D3 now.
432000	438000	And then there's also Len, who actually owns a company now.
438000	443000	He owns Maximum Family Games.
443000	446000	They do a lot of family product.
446000	452000	Recently they've been doing some of these Xbox Live Arcade titles come to disc version.
452000	456000	They just released the Serious Sam collection on 360,
456000	460000	and they had the Worms collection back in May on PS3 and 360 and stuff like that.
460000	461000	But that's not the thing.
461000	465000	So they've been in the industry forever, like ever and ever.
465000	470000	And before, they used to both work at Sega a long time ago,
470000	474000	like back when they were launching the Genesis a long time ago and stuff.
474000	476000	And so they were telling me so many stories.
476000	478000	It was just fantastic.
478000	484000	First off, Len was telling me stories about how, since he owns the company and stuff,
484000	488000	they deal a lot with shipping to Brazil and stuff and about all the difficulties with that
488000	494000	and how you get product in there and stuff and how you have to almost bribe officials
494000	496000	and stuff to get things in there is crazy.
496000	499000	But the stories from Sega were great.
499000	504000	They were talking about how they came up with, I guess they announced the core system
504000	512000	for the Sega Genesis at CES one of these years or something.
512000	515000	And they were telling, I guess everyone was saying,
515000	517000	Oh, well, that's a brilliant idea and stuff.
517000	520000	Because it was the first time that they had ever come out with a game system
520000	522000	that was actually called a core system.
522000	526000	It's kind of surprising that they've never released a game system
526000	531000	without a game packed in before or something cheaper, I guess.
531000	535000	But he was just saying, yeah, they literally came up with that idea the night before.
535000	538000	Some guy went to Kinko's, had the box printed up, and they put it on the roof,
538000	544000	covered it with some sort of tarp thing and then revealed it at CES.
544000	549000	But just a whole lot of things talking about how they were asking him,
549000	551000	so what do you guys think about the 32X?
551000	558000	Do you think this is going to be something that's going to work for consumers and stuff
558000	561000	and how they're saying it's such a bad idea and everything?
561000	564000	I don't know. It just sounded like a lot of fun.
564000	567000	I wish I could have got the guys on the show to talk about that kind of stuff,
567000	572000	but obviously they don't want a lot of the stuff coming back verbatim.
572000	575000	Some people would get butthurt about that kind of stuff.
575000	578000	Okay, total derailment here, but you're in the background of my Vine.
578000	579000	Can I still post that?
579000	580000	Oh, I don't care.
580000	581000	Just making sure.
581000	584000	I always ask permission before I post people's face on the internet,
584000	586000	but I wanted to show off my Lego Enterprise because I finished.
586000	588000	There you go.
588000	592000	Well, I'm glad you got to reminisce with people and old friends
592000	595000	that have moved from company to company and catch up on some of the drums, right?
595000	596000	Yeah, it's fun.
596000	603000	And then also my other friend from, I guess it's not really a publisher,
603000	605000	but he's a rep firm.
605000	610000	He works with, oh, what is it now?
610000	612000	It's Watt & Company.
612000	614000	He works with them.
614000	615000	I don't know.
615000	616000	There's a lot of these guys I've seen for a long time
616000	618000	because they've been here every single year.
618000	621000	There's a few reps that cycle through and stuff.
621000	623000	I did get to meet with Microsoft.
623000	624000	Oh, my God.
624000	625000	I swear to God.
625000	629000	One thing you'll learn about Microsoft if you're in the industry and stuff
629000	633000	and if you actually get face-to-face contact with some of these reps,
633000	636000	they're different than everybody else.
636000	641000	You'll talk to them, and you get this vibe from them.
641000	646000	It's just very much the Microsoft way of doing things.
646000	651000	For example, we were actually sitting down and having lunch,
651000	655000	and my coworkers started asking them questions about the Xbox One
655000	659000	and all the critical stuff about the Xbox One and stuff,
659000	661000	and just listening to the guys spin stuff.
661000	665000	I mean, obviously, he's kind of along the lines with how we're thinking.
665000	668000	It's really early, and a lot of this stuff is going to change,
668000	674000	so you can't really say too much about what it's going to be in the final product
674000	677000	considering that they can just turn around.
677000	682000	But just like such the, well, we were listening to the consumers and blah, blah, blah.
682000	686000	For example, I set up items for a company.
686000	689000	I set up items, and I don't have any of the first-party setup information,
689000	693000	so I asked Microsoft, hey, can you provide me a list of the UPCs
693000	695000	for the stuff that you have coming out?
695000	699000	Yeah, we're sorry, because you see, you guys don't really buy direct from us,
699000	701000	so you're going to have to ask somebody else.
701000	702000	What the fuck?
702000	705000	Oh, but we're supporting you guys.
705000	706000	That's why we're out here today.
706000	709000	What? Okay, fine.
709000	713000	You can't give me stuff to set up the items in our system so that we can sell your product.
713000	715000	I just won't bother pushing for that since.
715000	717000	We'll just not sell your product then.
717000	718000	I don't know.
718000	720000	The whole thing's a corporate script.
720000	721000	The whole thing is ridiculous.
721000	724000	This was the weird thing at E3, too,
724000	728000	is that there was just such the corporate script that nobody was going to deviate from.
728000	731000	Basically, everything benefits them.
731000	735000	They say they're thinking about the consumer, but it's always what's going to benefit Microsoft,
735000	737000	and that's what it comes down to.
737000	741000	That's everything that I've talked to them and listening to their spiel and stuff like that.
741000	743000	This isn't something new.
743000	747000	This has been around since the first year of Microsoft.
747000	752000	It's never about here's the upcoming games we have and stuff like that.
752000	755000	You guys need to sell more of our accessories.
755000	757000	You need to sell more.
757000	760000	This is how you should be upselling these games.
760000	762000	When someone orders a Halo 4, you should ask them,
762000	764000	do you want a year of live with that, too?
764000	768000	Dude, first off, I'm not selling retail, for one.
768000	773000	And two, my customers order live cards when they need them and stuff.
773000	776000	They don't need to be pushed for that stuff.
776000	777000	I remember the first year.
777000	780000	This is when the Xbox 360 launched.
780000	783000	Our guy, who is actually higher up now,
783000	785000	he's like, yeah, you guys need to be selling.
785000	787000	You need to be pushing the accessories.
787000	792000	Cool, but you're not shipping any to us because they're allocated.
792000	793000	We want to order them.
793000	795000	We're trying to sell them, but you're not shipping any.
795000	798000	And now you're telling us that we need to push them,
798000	801000	but we can't because you're not shipping any to us.
801000	804000	That's hilarious.
804000	806000	It's like banging your head against the wall.
806000	811000	Well, the line is that's the stuff they're trying to sell and push.
811000	815000	Sony on the other hand, I must add, asked them the same thing.
815000	817000	Hey, I need setup information for UPCs.
817000	818000	Guy gives me his card.
818000	821000	He says, send me an email and I'll get you the information you need.
821000	822000	Was that so fucking hard?
822000	823000	And guess what?
823000	824000	We don't buy direct from them either.
824000	827000	So perfect example.
827000	832000	It shouldn't be that difficult to get information from them to sell their product.
832000	833000	Yeah.
833000	834000	What he just said.
834000	835000	Hi.
835000	836000	Welcome to the show.
836000	837000	How are you?
837000	838000	Hopeful.
838000	839000	You smell like sandwich.
839000	840000	Did you bring a sandwich?
840000	841000	I brought Panda.
841000	842000	Oh, okay.
842000	843000	You were so wrong.
843000	844000	I haven't eaten all day.
844000	845000	That's fine.
845000	846000	That's fine.
846000	847000	All right.
847000	848000	Loki, one other thing I want to ask you about,
848000	850000	especially now that Dark Soccer is here to hear this,
850000	851000	the Ouya thing you've been tweeting about.
851000	852000	Oh God.
852000	853000	Yeah.
853000	854000	Come on.
854000	855000	What's up with the Ouya stuff?
855000	856000	Okay.
856000	857000	So since I've gotten my Ouya,
857000	858000	I don't even know if you've noticed on that controller that,
858000	861000	since you're borrowing the system now,
861000	862000	the analog six are fucked up.
862000	863000	Basically.
863000	864000	I just thought that was part of the system.
864000	865000	No.
865000	866000	No.
866000	867000	It's actually the analog six.
867000	869000	Because if you play with a PS3 controller, it works just fine.
869000	871000	But the analog six are fucked up.
871000	875000	They have like these really weird dead zones on them where if you try to move diagonally,
875000	876000	it's like it doesn't,
876000	880000	it registers you pushing it almost like a quarter of the way instead of all the way.
880000	882000	It's just not, it doesn't work right.
882000	885000	Like if you try to run in circles, it looks really weird.
885000	887000	So it was a defect.
887000	890000	It was a defect that was in the first run of those controllers.
890000	892000	And it's something that's documented.
892000	896000	And it's something I tested and I saw the same thing that they came up with.
896000	898000	So I've been trying to get it replaced recently.
898000	900000	Because I know they've been busy with the launch and stuff,
900000	903000	and it's just getting a hold of customer service.
903000	905000	I started my claim,
905000	909000	or I should say my support ticket back in June on the 25th.
910000	915000	And the first response I got from them was kind of a canned response.
915000	917000	Because everyone's asking, you know, where's my OUYA system?
917000	921000	So it was all this information about, you know, when your OUYA system's coming
921000	924000	and when, you know, how to track it and all that stuff.
924000	928000	I'm like, well, if you read the ticket I sent you,
928000	931000	it has nothing to do with what I've been asking.
931000	934000	And then so finally I got a response from,
934000	936000	and the guy sent me this RMA thing, so I filled it all out,
936000	938000	took a picture of the serial number and stuff,
938000	940000	and I hadn't heard from him in two weeks.
940000	941000	I'm like, okay.
941000	943000	I keep responding back to the thread.
943000	946000	I'm like, hey, where do we go from here?
946000	948000	What's going on here?
948000	950000	And so then finally he's like, I get a response back,
950000	953000	your replacement faceplates have been sent out
953000	955000	because I guess there's some problem with some of the faceplates,
955000	958000	and so people are requesting the faceplates.
958000	961000	Once again, didn't read anything that I sent them.
961000	964000	You know, I'm like, dude, I don't need faceplates.
965000	967000	I need a new controller.
967000	969000	I can take the faceplates off,
969000	971000	and the controller works just the same as it does now.
971000	975000	It's so weird that they wouldn't go back and read the notes unless,
975000	978000	I mean, I wonder if it's not an outsource thing,
978000	981000	where if like certain words aren't there that, I mean,
981000	985000	a certain very literal script is usually followed in an outsource environment.
985000	987000	It doesn't sound like, you know,
987000	989000	I mean, unless they're just making up names,
989000	992000	but I mean, it's like Chad and, you know,
993000	995000	EA's does that.
995000	999000	I'm just saying, so it took me filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau,
999000	1001000	which they already have, you know,
1001000	1003000	it looks like a few complaints against them already.
1003000	1007000	They're not part of the Better Business Bureau yet,
1007000	1010000	and that didn't really do anything.
1010000	1013000	So then I had a complaint on Twitter,
1013000	1019000	and so finally got the attention of their community manager,
1019000	1021000	and she kind of got the ball rolling a little bit,
1021000	1023000	and I finally got another response saying that I was supposed to be,
1023000	1026000	he's forwarding my thing to the RMA department.
1026000	1029000	So still, I don't have a fixed controller.
1029000	1031000	I mean, literally, I could have gone out to the store,
1031000	1033000	it's not the right way to do it,
1033000	1036000	but I could have gone to the store, bought a brand new Ouia controller,
1036000	1039000	and took it back, took my old controller back as defective,
1039000	1042000	and got my money back, and could have had it replaced weeks ago,
1042000	1046000	but, you know, I wanted to do it through the proper channels,
1046000	1048000	although if I get dicked around for another couple weeks,
1048000	1049000	I am going to do that.
1049000	1052000	So that's where I'm at. I still don't have a fixed controller yet.
1055000	1056000	What a mess.
1056000	1057000	Yeah.
1057000	1058000	Customer service is so important.
1058000	1061000	Their customer service is absolutely terrible.
1061000	1064000	And then this goes just the full gamut.
1064000	1066000	It's just not been good at all.
1066000	1068000	And yeah, I understand that they're a new company,
1068000	1069000	but come on, man.
1069000	1072000	They've been dealing with customer service issues for the last three months now.
1072000	1075000	They should be a little bit more on top of it.
1075000	1078000	I mean, just even getting back to people,
1078000	1081000	you know, in a timely manner, or reading the email.
1081000	1084000	If you're getting a read back, you know, respond back to somebody,
1084000	1087000	read through what the whole problem is when you're saying,
1087000	1089000	oh, I'm going to send you replacement faceplates.
1089000	1091000	That's not going to fucking fix the problem.
1091000	1094000	I don't know. It's just, it's strange.
1094000	1099000	But, and now they've got, like, some more news about what they're trying to do,
1099000	1100000	the drive-up sales and stuff,
1100000	1103000	and even, like, their response to the NPD numbers this month.
1103000	1106000	They're saying, oh, yeah, the Ouia launch hasn't been very successful
1106000	1108000	because they haven't sold that many units.
1108000	1109000	They're like, well, we sold out of all of our units.
1109000	1111000	We're chasing demand right now.
1111000	1113000	Yeah, because your manufacturing is so fucking slow.
1113000	1118000	But, I don't know, it's, I'm just kind of over that system already.
1118000	1122000	It's kind of felt like it was a whole mistake to back it in the first place, but.
1122000	1124000	Well, Dan said he wanted one.
1124000	1127000	And I'm like, no, we're not getting one.
1127000	1128000	I'm putting my foot down.
1128000	1130000	It's not, it's not terrible.
1130000	1134000	It's, and I think it's going to get better because it's just a system right now.
1134000	1137000	You know, it's all up to the developers and what they're, you know,
1137000	1138000	coming out with and stuff.
1138000	1140000	And they even had some stuff that came out of their, like,
1140000	1143000	little game jam thing that they did that looked really cool,
1143000	1145000	but not a lot of it's actually been made yet.
1145000	1148000	Like, there's a game called Television that I wanted to play.
1148000	1153000	It was kind of this weird, like, almost like a WarioWare type of game.
1153000	1157000	And it just hasn't come out yet, but it looked kind of cool.
1157000	1160000	And they've got some other games that look really neat on them,
1160000	1161000	plus you can sideload stuff.
1161000	1163000	But a lot of the stuff that they promised, like,
1163000	1164000	that was going to be easily routable.
1164000	1168000	Like, they were going to basically have almost like a one button root for it.
1168000	1169000	That hasn't happened.
1169000	1173000	And, hell, it can't even access, you know, external storage devices yet.
1173000	1175000	None of that stuff's happened.
1175000	1180000	It can't, you know, it doesn't have any sort of online multiplayer.
1180000	1183000	There's no, like, any, you know, sharing of, like, friend,
1183000	1185000	there's no friends list things built into it.
1185000	1186000	There's nothing.
1186000	1189000	It's just very rushed, I guess.
1191000	1195000	WhatupG asks in chat, who has great customer service?
1195000	1197000	I can think of a few companies.
1197000	1202000	I'll say my car insurance company, AAA, has always been really good to me.
1202000	1204000	I can't really complain about them at all.
1204000	1207000	I would say the masters of customer service.
1207000	1208000	I've never seen anyone do it better.
1208000	1210000	Disney. Disneyland.
1210000	1212000	Yeah, but I'm saying as far as game industry,
1212000	1216000	I actually had really good customer service with Blizzard.
1216000	1217000	Yeah.
1217000	1219000	The two times I've had to call, I had really good service.
1219000	1223000	I don't like how long I've had to wait in some of the hold times,
1223000	1225000	but once you get through to somebody, yeah,
1225000	1228000	my experiences with Blizzard has been good.
1228000	1229000	I can't complain.
1229000	1232000	The best, or one of the best is supposed to be Zappos,
1232000	1233000	but I've never really ordered from them,
1233000	1236000	although I've met them, met the people at the company,
1236000	1238000	and they're all really great.
1238000	1239000	They're all shoes, right?
1239000	1241000	They're shoes and clothing and stuff.
1241000	1242000	They did get into electronics for a while.
1242000	1244000	I actually sold them games for a little bit,
1244000	1246000	but they're really great.
1246000	1249000	I mean, just everybody there is fantastic.
1249000	1251000	They're a very unique corporate culture, too.
1251000	1252000	It really works for them.
1252000	1253000	It's really cool.
1253000	1256000	None of the executives have offices there.
1256000	1258000	They're all down there in cubicles with everybody,
1258000	1261000	and it's just very, it's good morale,
1261000	1263000	and just everybody is really happy to work there,
1263000	1264000	and I think that's how you do it.
1264000	1268000	You keep people happy, and they will be happy.
1268000	1269000	I mean, if they're pissed off at their job,
1269000	1272000	they're not going to be happy to your customers.
1272000	1275000	The place that I just got hired for believes the same thing,
1275000	1276000	and everyone looked super happy there.
1276000	1279000	I'm not going to say where I got hired, but still.
1279000	1280000	Technist in Chat says,
1280000	1282000	Costco has amazing customer service.
1282000	1284000	Returns with no question asked.
1284000	1286000	They changed some of that policy lately.
1286000	1288000	I mean, I think they still probably have
1288000	1290000	the most liberal return policy in most companies,
1290000	1293000	but it's not as crazy as it used to be.
1293000	1295000	Tiger Claw asks, Rob, you're a corporate trainer.
1295000	1297000	Do you teach customer service?
1297000	1300000	I did for seven years, and obviously,
1300000	1304000	just due to separating my day job and my hobby,
1304000	1305000	I'm not going to tell you where I work,
1305000	1308000	or much more than that, but yes,
1308000	1310000	I taught customer service for seven years,
1310000	1312000	and I actually still, even though,
1312000	1313000	I am still a corporate trainer.
1313000	1314000	I teach something else.
1314000	1316000	I sometimes teach customer service elements,
1316000	1320000	and I still write some manuals relating to that,
1320000	1322000	so that's why it's important to me,
1322000	1325000	and I think a lot of companies,
1325000	1328000	I hate it when they let it go,
1328000	1331000	because one of the biggest things about customer service
1331000	1333000	is just having to have the mentality.
1333000	1335000	You want to do good things.
1335000	1339000	That's 90% of it right there, so anyway,
1339000	1342000	I won't get into too much more than that.
1342000	1344000	A lot of people in chat saying Amazon.
1344000	1347000	Rama's saying Newegg is great customer service.
1347000	1349000	Bonds006 says, how can I forget Nintendo?
1349000	1351000	They have yet to let me down.
1351000	1353000	And I've worked in customer service
1353000	1357000	for a solid eight years, so trust me,
1357000	1360000	when you're in it, you know what not to do.
1360000	1362000	I've called people out on stuff.
1362000	1366000	Yeah, and I've actually, when I get good phone service,
1366000	1368000	which I can't remember the last company I got it from.
1368000	1371000	It's just been, I don't actually call places a whole lot.
1371000	1374000	I kind of prefer to do interactions online myself,
1374000	1376000	but the last time I called somebody,
1376000	1377000	I asked such good customer service,
1377000	1379000	I actually said, can I talk to your manager
1379000	1380000	and leave a compliment?
1380000	1381000	You know what I usually do?
1381000	1383000	They love that.
1383000	1385000	Actually, it's even better.
1385000	1386000	If you like someone's job,
1386000	1389000	ask for the fax number, fax them a letter,
1389000	1391000	because when I worked in customer service before,
1391000	1394000	verbal compliments were really good,
1394000	1397000	but written compliments were like the gold star,
1397000	1398000	they were the diamond star.
1398000	1400000	Yeah, and if you're willing to do that,
1400000	1403000	not waste your time, spend your time doing something like that,
1403000	1405000	you know, that, you know.
1405000	1407000	I got 14 of them in one year.
1407000	1409000	I got taken out to dinner five times.
1409000	1410000	Little did show off.
1410000	1412000	No, it was that one year that we were so super busy
1412000	1414000	and I worked all that overtime,
1414000	1416000	but I actually just sort of gave up on the call time
1416000	1418000	and ended up helping out whoever it was,
1418000	1420000	because it was really freaking busy.
1420000	1423000	And it's one thing when you have 255 calls in queue,
1423000	1426000	and your queue max is 255.
1426000	1428000	Yeah.
1428000	1430000	Anyway, I don't know how we got on that.
1430000	1431000	Oh, yeah, we have stuff.
1431000	1434000	But anyway, anything else about your antics this week
1434000	1435000	you want to share with us, Loki,
1435000	1436000	before we get into gaming weeks?
1436000	1437000	That's pretty much it.
1437000	1439000	All right, let's get into how was your gaming week
1439000	1440000	and the types of video games
1440000	1442000	that you have been playing this week.
1442000	1443000	Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.
1443000	1444000	Animal Crossing.
1444000	1445000	Still?
1445000	1446000	Yep.
1446000	1447000	Ooh, is my DS around?
1447000	1448000	I got to make sure.
1448000	1449000	I got to make sure our 3DS is mate.
1449000	1450000	I turned mine on.
1450000	1451000	Mine's been on all day.
1451000	1453000	Actually, when I went to South Sac yesterday,
1453000	1455000	I straight passed two people there.
1455000	1456000	I have no idea who,
1456000	1458000	but there were two people in South Sac,
1458000	1460000	so if you're listening, I straight passed you totally.
1460000	1464000	And then, yeah, I actually, let's see,
1464000	1466000	I've just expanded my second room.
1466000	1469000	So I've expanded my upstairs,
1469000	1471000	I've expanded my house twice,
1471000	1474000	the upstairs once, my side room once,
1474000	1475000	my other side room once,
1475000	1477000	and now I'm going to be expanding my basement.
1477000	1480000	I have like 56,000 bills left.
1480000	1482000	Okay, anyone who wants a tip,
1482000	1483000	fish on the island.
1483000	1485000	Fish on the island, cat sharks.
1485000	1488000	Throw everything back if they're not a shark.
1488000	1490000	I've heard beetles on the island.
1490000	1492000	Yeah, some of the beetles, not all of them.
1492000	1494000	The Goliath ones are worth some money.
1494000	1498000	And that's, oh, and I finished Little Inferno.
1498000	1500000	That game is weird.
1500000	1502000	That was the one where you set things on fire, right?
1502000	1503000	Yes, I love that game.
1503000	1504000	Good times.
1504000	1506000	And that's really about it,
1506000	1508000	because I've been job interviewing.
1508000	1510000	I've been shopping for professional clothes.
1510000	1512000	But congrats, you got the job,
1512000	1513000	and I know you don't want to say,
1513000	1515000	well, you'll tell me all about it off air, but.
1515000	1517000	I pretty much knew I had it right after the interview,
1517000	1520000	because they're already talking about other stuff.
1520000	1521000	That's a good feeling.
1521000	1522000	Well, congrats.
1522000	1524000	And the company is really reputable.
1524000	1525000	I'm not going to say anything,
1525000	1527000	because I do want that window of separation.
1527000	1528000	Yeah, we all do.
1528000	1531000	But they're a really good, reputable,
1531000	1536000	long-standing company who got very high ratings
1536000	1538000	for how well they take care of their employees.
1538000	1539000	Wow.
1539000	1542000	Well, what a positive time between that and the house stuff.
1542000	1545000	And then, yeah, we found two really good houses today,
1545000	1547000	and we put out an offer on one of them today.
1547000	1548000	Nice.
1548000	1549000	And a little two-bedroom house,
1549000	1550000	but we have a big office in it.
1550000	1552000	Yeah, well, fingers and toes crossed.
1552000	1553000	And my own bathroom.
1553000	1554000	All right.
1554000	1555000	So, yeah.
1555000	1556000	Fingers, is that the one out,
1556000	1557000	I guess I can say Antelope.
1557000	1558000	Was that the one at Antelope?
1558000	1559000	An Antelope.
1559000	1560000	That's going to be a bit of a drive.
1560000	1561000	It'd be a schlep,
1561000	1563000	but it'd be a watt to 50 for me to get to work.
1563000	1564000	That's not bad.
1564000	1565000	All right.
1565000	1567000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1567000	1569000	I played lots of stuff this week.
1569000	1572000	So, some stuff out of the little game show thing.
1572000	1575000	I played a brief demo.
1575000	1580000	It was the E3 demo for Yiba Ninja Gaiden Z,
1580000	1582000	which honestly plays just like Ninja Gaiden,
1582000	1584000	except what's kind of cool is the zombies,
1584000	1585000	you can cut off their hands and stuff,
1585000	1587000	and they turn into different weapons.
1587000	1588000	So, like, I cut off some of the arms,
1588000	1590000	and they turn into almost like a nunchuck.
1590000	1594000	I managed to crash the demo at the end,
1594000	1595000	because I was supposed to,
1595000	1597000	there was supposed to be this zombie
1597000	1598000	that you throw into a car,
1598000	1601000	and he's supposed to drive this truck into,
1601000	1603000	like, this sex shop or whatever,
1603000	1605000	and panties are supposed to fly out,
1605000	1606000	because, you know, it's awesome.
1606000	1610000	Instead, somehow, it let me kill the zombie,
1610000	1612000	and then I couldn't finish the demo,
1612000	1613000	which is kind of funny.
1613000	1615000	But I've already seen how it ends, so,
1615000	1616000	yeah, it wasn't that big a deal.
1617000	1621000	And then I played a bit of Splinter Cell Conviction,
1621000	1624000	which, honestly, I have, or not Conviction,
1624000	1627000	Splinter Cell Blacklist, that's a new one.
1630000	1632000	Never really played a Splinter Cell game.
1632000	1635000	It's kind of fun, you know, a self-action game.
1635000	1638000	I do like the new little gimmick that they have in there,
1638000	1641000	where you can mark different targets,
1641000	1644000	and then you do this, you hit a button to execute them,
1644000	1646000	and then it does it, like, all cinematic,
1646000	1648000	and it's kind of neat.
1649000	1652000	Apparently, that's only available in the lower difficulties,
1652000	1653000	which I was playing on Rookie,
1653000	1655000	because I just didn't care.
1655000	1658000	And, I don't know, it was a fun game.
1658000	1660000	Not one I'm probably going to pick up,
1660000	1662000	because it's not my style of gameplay,
1662000	1665000	but it looks good, so it was fun.
1668000	1669000	What else?
1669000	1671000	I played more Super Meat Boy.
1672000	1677000	I pretty much got all the A pluses for the first level.
1677000	1678000	I'm working on the second level,
1678000	1681000	and that includes both the dark and light worlds,
1681000	1685000	and I got all of the bandages.
1685000	1687000	So, then I have...
1688000	1689000	Who did I unlock?
1689000	1693000	I unlocked the robot from Macarium, I think,
1693000	1695000	and then also...
1696000	1698000	Oh, what's his name?
1699000	1701000	I don't even remember who it was.
1701000	1703000	Just a bunch of other characters.
1703000	1705000	Oh, the alien from Alien Hominid,
1705000	1709000	and some other character.
1709000	1710000	I don't even know who it is.
1710000	1712000	It's from some other indie game.
1712000	1714000	I'm trying to get the guy from Minecraft,
1714000	1718000	because he has the coolest kind of special attack.
1718000	1720000	He can actually dig through the level.
1720000	1723000	Shadownextchan in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
1723000	1725000	Loki, the mark and shoot mechanic,
1725000	1726000	was also in Splinter Cell Conviction.
1726000	1727000	You should check it out.
1728000	1729000	Okay.
1732000	1733000	And then, before the show,
1733000	1737000	I got sent the beta for Mercenary Kings,
1737000	1740000	which is a game I backed on Kickstarter,
1741000	1742000	and it's awesome.
1742000	1745000	It looks very much like a...
1746000	1749000	Like a Metal Slug, but it's not.
1749000	1751000	You can craft weapons in the game,
1751000	1753000	because you collect things.
1753000	1754000	It's really hard,
1754000	1758000	and all really awesome hand-drawn pixel art.
1761000	1762000	I don't know.
1762000	1763000	I played it for about 15 minutes,
1763000	1765000	and it was pretty sweet.
1765000	1766000	I never finished the first level,
1766000	1767000	because I had no fucking clue
1767000	1768000	where I was supposed to be going.
1768000	1770000	I was supposed to be rescuing one guy,
1770000	1771000	and I went all through the level,
1771000	1773000	because it kind of plays a little Metroidvania, I guess.
1773000	1775000	They're very open levels,
1775000	1777000	but since I have no map,
1777000	1779000	or don't know where I'm supposed to be going,
1779000	1781000	I kind of wandered the level for a while,
1781000	1783000	and couldn't find who I was supposed to be rescuing,
1783000	1785000	because you have a time limit.
1786000	1787000	But yeah, it looks awesome,
1787000	1789000	and hopefully I get the full game pretty soon.
1789000	1792000	I know, I think the Shadowrun Returns game
1792000	1793000	should be coming out pretty soon.
1793000	1796000	I've got that, so I should be getting that,
1796000	1797000	and also Shadowrun Online,
1797000	1799000	whenever the hell that comes out.
1799000	1801000	So both of those.
1803000	1805000	I need to check on Shadowgate Returns.
1805000	1806000	I know I backed that kick,
1806000	1808000	so I've only backed two, maybe.
1808000	1810000	Oh, no, no, because there were the two recently,
1810000	1812000	because we had them both on the network
1812000	1813000	that I backed.
1813000	1815000	But then there was also,
1815000	1818000	I'm starting to see the rewards for GamerCon,
1818000	1819000	or as they call it, GamerX,
1819000	1820000	is next weekend.
1820000	1821000	That's actually happening,
1821000	1822000	which is pretty cool.
1822000	1825000	So I'm just financing reaping the rewards of that.
1825000	1828000	And then Shadowgate was the only other thing
1828000	1829000	I've ever kickstarted
1829000	1832000	outside of the Professor Shy Guy thing.
1832000	1834000	So I'm still waiting for that to come out,
1834000	1835000	which I think is later this year,
1835000	1836000	so I'm excited about that.
1836000	1839000	Yeah, so I think that's all I played this week.
1839000	1841000	I wanted to play some other stuff.
1841000	1843000	I installed a few games.
1845000	1846000	So, yeah, that's it.
1846000	1848000	Although there's going to be lots of taking up of time,
1848000	1850000	so I don't know if I'll get into a lot of these games.
1850000	1852000	I just need to do the third.
1852000	1855000	Still have a few achievements left I need to get.
1856000	1857000	Okay.
1857000	1858000	So my gaming week.
1858000	1860000	I've played quite a bit of different things,
1860000	1862000	just kind of like a potpourri of stuff.
1862000	1864000	And I think not playing MMOs right now,
1864000	1866000	because I'm kind of holding out.
1866000	1867000	I know Final Fantasy XIV,
1867000	1869000	Realm Reborn is going to be the next big thing
1869000	1870000	I get sucked into,
1870000	1872000	but it's not really out until mid-August,
1872000	1873000	whenever the early launch
1873000	1875000	and the next beta phase happen and all that.
1875000	1877000	So I'm kind of in this lull right now.
1877000	1878000	World of Warcraft,
1878000	1880000	most of my friends are on hiatus.
1880000	1882000	They've either just gone off to play other things,
1882000	1883000	or they're going to play XIV,
1883000	1885000	or they quit, or whatever.
1885000	1887000	There's just not a lot of people still playing WoW.
1887000	1889000	There's just a couple people I still run into,
1889000	1890000	but not a lot.
1890000	1892000	So I sign into WoW maybe once every few days,
1892000	1894000	play a PvP battleground,
1894000	1895000	try to talk to people,
1895000	1896000	but that's about it.
1896000	1897000	So I've been using this time
1897000	1899000	to kind of catch up on single-player things
1899000	1900000	and Steam Sale, obviously,
1900000	1902000	has been a huge contributor to that.
1902000	1904000	The trading card metagame.
1904000	1907000	I actually did my badge today for the summer sale,
1907000	1908000	so I got my summer sale badge,
1908000	1911000	and it gave me a friends list boost to five people.
1911000	1912000	Not everybody would get that.
1912000	1914000	That's just, I think you get a random loot.
1914000	1916000	And I got a background for my profile,
1916000	1918000	so now when you go visit my profile on Steam,
1918000	1921000	which is, I think, GreenSky42 is my external name,
1921000	1924000	you can actually see my little trading card background.
1924000	1927000	You know, just a silly thing.
1927000	1929000	So, yeah, there was that.
1929000	1932000	Thanks to that, I kind of was playing some more games on Steam.
1932000	1934000	A few things to note, Skyrim,
1934000	1936000	I started randomly playing the other night,
1936000	1938000	because, you know, Skyrim is that game
1938000	1939000	you can just get sucked into.
1939000	1940000	Yeah, cards, partially cards.
1940000	1942000	I got all of my cards in one sitting.
1942000	1946000	That'll tell you how I got sucked into Skyrim one night, right?
1946000	1947000	So there was that.
1947000	1949000	But then the other game I got really sucked into,
1949000	1951000	Torchlight 2.
1951000	1952000	I bought it.
1952000	1954000	I didn't play it, but I bought it.
1954000	1956000	The last day of the sale is going on right now.
1956000	1959000	If you're listening to the podcast, you probably missed it.
1959000	1960000	But if you're listening live,
1960000	1963000	that last day of the sale has all the encore sales going on right now,
1963000	1965000	and I know Torchlight 2 is only five bucks.
1965000	1968000	I already had the game, because I bought it when it first came out,
1968000	1971000	but I played it for like a little bit, and then I just, you know,
1971000	1973000	gamer ADD, I went and played something else.
1973000	1976000	But I randomly decided to play it the other night to get trading cards,
1976000	1978000	and I was doing a live stream of it,
1978000	1980000	because I've been getting into live streaming more
1980000	1983000	on my personal Twitch channel, which is just Rob Roberts on Twitch.
1984000	1986000	I played some Torchlight 2 this week,
1986000	1988000	and yeah, I played some more today,
1988000	1990000	and my character's up to like level 18 or something,
1990000	1992000	so good times.
1992000	1994000	Speaking of live streaming,
1994000	1996000	after the show last week,
1996000	1998000	Shane made me play Slender the Eight Pages
1998000	2000000	and do a live stream.
2000000	2002000	Oh my god.
2002000	2005000	That game was scary, but I beat his score.
2005000	2007000	He's only got as far as two pages.
2007000	2010000	I got to three pages, but by sheer dumb luck.
2010000	2012000	And I live streamed the whole thing,
2012000	2015000	and I had the lights out, so like all you could see is my silhouette
2015000	2017000	and the lights from Alan's computer,
2017000	2019000	because I had like my little webcam in the corner.
2019000	2022000	It's all in the archive on my channel at Twitch TV, Rob Roberts.
2022000	2025000	And I did have a jump screen,
2025000	2027000	where I literally screamed once,
2027000	2030000	and Shane, I just, he started laughing,
2030000	2032000	and then I bust up laughing. It was really funny.
2032000	2035000	But it was scary, like I was in this like bathroom area
2035000	2037000	looking for a page, and I turned the corner,
2037000	2039000	and he was right there, and the music did the
2039000	2041000	BONG, and like the tentacles were coming out and everything,
2041000	2044000	and I was like, ah! So I let out this big screech.
2044000	2046000	So, that was fun.
2046000	2050000	Even though, you know, I probably won't play that again anytime soon.
2050000	2052000	But that was a good thrill for that.
2052000	2054000	I also bought Final Fantasy VII on the Steam sale,
2054000	2058000	because it was on the Flash sale yesterday for eight hours.
2058000	2061000	It was eight bucks, and I bought it.
2061000	2063000	Not cheap enough yet.
2063000	2065000	Well, here's the thing. There's some things I like about it.
2065000	2068000	Even though the music in its MIDI form is kind of,
2069000	2071000	the graphics are improved.
2071000	2074000	Like, I mean, I realize it's probably using a lot of
2074000	2076000	the same formulas from the PlayStation 1,
2076000	2078000	but like, the polygons there, they look crisp.
2078000	2080000	Like, they look really good.
2080000	2083000	But the whole cloud saving feature is busted.
2083000	2085000	And I don't know if it's just because so many people bought it
2085000	2087000	when it went on the Flash sale yesterday,
2087000	2089000	but like, I could not save my game yesterday.
2089000	2092000	That's very frustrating and stupid.
2092000	2094000	Like, if the cloud thing doesn't work,
2094000	2096000	the game should still let you save locally by default.
2096000	2099000	But I could not save, and I streamed this whole thing happening.
2099000	2101000	I couldn't save to a local file.
2101000	2103000	That's ridiculous. Come on.
2103000	2106000	Like, I realize that Square's trying to tie everything together online
2106000	2109000	to do the boost level thing and everything,
2109000	2111000	but it's ridiculous.
2111000	2114000	It should always save locally, and then to the cloud.
2114000	2116000	Yes, right?
2116000	2119000	So I have to really dog Final Fantasy VII for that cloud saving thing,
2119000	2121000	because it does more harm than good in this case.
2121000	2124000	I'm hoping they fix it, but it did not leave a good impression.
2124000	2128000	Like, who wants to replay the first hour of the game again, you know?
2128000	2132000	I mean, well, I guess I did play it for the first time,
2132000	2134000	but like, the first time in a few years.
2134000	2137000	Not the first time since yesterday.
2137000	2141000	Jason in our chat room, vxjasonxv at live.hognetwork.com says,
2141000	2145000	Cloud can't save Aeris. You expect him to save your game?
2145000	2148000	Lol. I would hope.
2148000	2150000	My cloud would have stabbed her.
2151000	2154000	Let's see. I'm also looking here.
2154000	2158000	Tigerclaw says, Rob needs to play more scary games on Twitch.
2158000	2160000	It's a possibility. It's a possibility.
2160000	2163000	I'm trying to play a variety of things. Just sometimes classic things.
2163000	2166000	Too bad you don't have the Oculus Rift and then play like a Slender game.
2166000	2167000	No!
2167000	2169000	You know what, by the way, Rob?
2169000	2172000	I did remember one other video game related thing we did last night.
2172000	2174000	We watched the live stream of video games live.
2174000	2176000	Oh yeah, I saw part of that.
2176000	2177000	It was pretty good.
2177000	2179000	I decided to stream at the same time it was on,
2179000	2181000	which is probably why nobody was watching.
2181000	2183000	I'm amused by David Hader's ponytail.
2183000	2185000	Nice.
2185000	2188000	Let's see, Ragenator says, speaking of streaming on Twitch, etc.
2188000	2191000	How would a total newbie like me stream on a site like that?
2191000	2193000	It's actually not too difficult.
2193000	2197000	The program I use, which is great, is Open Broadcast Software?
2197000	2199000	Open Broadcaster Source?
2199000	2200000	I use FFSplit.
2200000	2201000	Do you?
2201000	2202000	Yeah.
2202000	2204000	Oh, no. I like Open Broadcaster.
2204000	2206000	Look that one up because that one's great.
2206000	2209000	I remember what I used because my computer had the format of the hard drive,
2209000	2211000	so I don't have my program anymore.
2211000	2214000	FFSplit, I did not get as good a performance out of that as I did.
2214000	2216000	I mean, it's nice because that's free and everything,
2216000	2221000	but I got a better performance out of OBS.
2221000	2224000	Let's see, also trying to read through our chat room real quick
2224000	2228000	at live.vognetwork.com.
2228000	2230000	I guess that's it for now for chat comments,
2230000	2231000	but we'll get some more of these later.
2231000	2234000	Some folks commenting on a story that's coming up.
2234000	2235000	But I think I got everything in my gaming week.
2235000	2237000	Oh, one other thing I should throw out there.
2237000	2240000	On the Wii U this week, and I'm spoiling the news a little bit,
2240000	2242000	but it's my own story.
2242000	2244000	Earthbound was out on the Wii U this week.
2244000	2246000	I played a bit of that on Virtual Console.
2246000	2249000	It's nice to revisit that game after a very long time.
2249000	2252000	I played it on emulators once, like years ago,
2252000	2256000	but to be able to play it again on the TV and on the little game pad
2256000	2258000	is a nice experience.
2258000	2261000	That is a great, great RPG, one of my all-time favorites.
2261000	2262000	It really is.
2262000	2264000	I know Bobby's been razzing me a little bit
2264000	2267000	about the whole Super Metroid versus Earthbound thing,
2267000	2269000	but I'm always kind of like,
2269000	2271000	but Earthbound really is a really good game,
2271000	2273000	and I don't find Earthbound to be overrated.
2273000	2276000	It's not my favorite game, but it's probably in my top five, honestly.
2276000	2278000	I love Earthbound. It's great.
2278000	2280000	So, glad to be playing that again.
2280000	2282000	And glad to hear they didn't really change a lot.
2282000	2285000	The changes they made, very minor stuff.
2285000	2287000	They made one dialogue change,
2287000	2289000	and I don't even think it was that big a deal,
2289000	2291000	but they changed some of the graphic effects
2291000	2295000	to tone down the amazing seizure displays that some of the PSI effects had.
2295000	2296000	You mean the embryos?
2296000	2297000	Hmm?
2297000	2298000	You mean the embryos?
2298000	2299000	Yeah, right.
2299000	2302000	So, yeah, good times.
2302000	2305000	Okay, so that's it for our Gaming Weeks.
2305000	2310000	Quick housekeeping, twitter.com, excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR,
2310000	2313000	or facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio if you want to follow us.
2313000	2316000	And of course, do support the other shows we have
2317000	2319000	vog network dot com.
2319000	2321000	I do not, and this is going to be news to you guys,
2321000	2323000	so sorry to spring this on you mid-show.
2323000	2325000	We will not be here in two weeks,
2325000	2327000	because I'm going to be at that convention in San Francisco.
2327000	2328000	I won't be back in time.
2328000	2330000	So, because Sunday's the last day.
2330000	2331000	So, sorry.
2331000	2332000	Okay.
2332000	2333000	Sorry about it.
2333000	2335000	No show in two weeks.
2335000	2336000	Surprise.
2336000	2338000	Well, maybe, I don't, I don't,
2338000	2343000	keep that flexible, because maybe I'll be back early enough,
2343000	2345000	or we can do something a little later or something,
2345000	2347000	but I just, yeah.
2347000	2349000	I totally want to take over the stream and do a fuck-off show.
2349000	2350000	Yeah, do whatever you want.
2350000	2351000	It's called Jamie Rants.
2351000	2353000	Or do a live stream.
2353000	2355000	Loki can play Borderlands whenever, so.
2355000	2356000	I'm not playing Borderlands.
2356000	2359000	I'm hoping I can do some fun stuff at the convention,
2359000	2362000	and I'm going to be seeing a lot of my podcast pals from like,
2362000	2366000	well, we're all doing that panel, which I should obviously be plugging, duh.
2366000	2370000	Saturday night, and I believe six o'clock, is Podcast Cross Zone.
2370000	2373000	It's OLR, me.
2373000	2378000	It's Koopa Club, our friends from Chicago,
2378000	2381000	and I believe Long Beach is where one of their hosts lives.
2381000	2385000	Game Buoy, Game Bar, and more.
2385000	2390000	Special surprise guest, hopefully, all talking about podcasting,
2390000	2392000	and kind of our own shows,
2392000	2395000	and trying to enable other people to do their own shows,
2395000	2398000	and enable more broadcasters.
2398000	2400000	It is a GLBT-focused convention, obviously,
2400000	2404000	but we're really about everybody, you know, having a voice.
2404000	2405000	Good times.
2407000	2411000	Alright, let's get into some news.
2411000	2412000	Loki.
2412000	2414000	Yes, Pokemon Rumble.
2414000	2418000	I'm actually kind of surprised that this is coming out still digitally,
2418000	2420000	but Pokemon Rumble was a game that came out in Japan,
2420000	2423000	I think earlier last year, maybe this year.
2425000	2428000	It was a digital download for the Wii U,
2428000	2433000	and what makes it kind of unique is it was sort of going the Skylanders route,
2433000	2438000	where you have these physical figurines that you buy for a certain amount of money,
2438000	2443000	and you, I think you put them on the, I don't know if it's,
2443000	2449000	I want to say it was the Near Field Communication part of the Wii U tablet,
2449000	2453000	or the game pad, or whatever, and it interacted with that.
2453000	2457000	So, it is coming out over here in North America, August 29th.
2458000	2460000	18 figurines.
2460000	2464000	However, they are sold exclusively at Evil-G,
2464000	2473000	so if you watch your Pokemon, you know, Nintendo has still made this blood pack with Evil-G to do that.
2473000	2476000	The game, I guess, is 18 bucks in the eShop.
2476000	2478000	Each figurine is going to be $4.
2479000	2480000	I don't know.
2482000	2483000	Neat.
2484000	2486000	I, uh, why not?
2487000	2492000	Except for the fact that it's a GameStop exclusive, but something to hold us over until X and Y, right?
2492000	2495000	Europe is also going to be getting the game August 15th.
2495000	2500000	No words on how they're going to, if that's going to be done through GameStop in Europe as well.
2500000	2501000	I don't know.
2501000	2503000	But, it's kind of lame.
2503000	2504000	I don't know.
2504000	2507000	I just don't understand why they're making, I mean, I understand they're a big company,
2507000	2512000	but why exclusive through GameStop to do this stuff?
2512000	2515000	I don't know why they would do that.
2516000	2519000	I mean, because honestly, I think everybody could sell those stupid figurines.
2519000	2521000	Hell, they put it on the game as, like, a disc.
2521000	2523000	I'm surprised they didn't do that in the first place.
2523000	2525000	$20 game, you know?
2525000	2528000	Yeah, especially because Nintendo puts a lot of stuff on disc.
2528000	2532000	Yeah, put it in a $20 game, maybe bundle it with a figurine or something like that, and there you go.
2532000	2534000	Super Luigi U is on disc, right?
2534000	2535000	It will be.
2535000	2536000	Anyway.
2536000	2538000	Alright, well, more Nintendo news.
2538000	2541000	I mentioned this, obviously, during my gaming week, but I want to officially acknowledge
2541000	2545000	EarthBound is finally out on the Virtual Console.
2545000	2549000	It's only available on Wii U, however, so you can't get it on 3DS, you can't get it on the Wii,
2549000	2554000	which sadly makes sense because Nintendo's trying to push people to the Wii U,
2554000	2557000	and there are people crazy enough to buy a Wii U to play EarthBound.
2557000	2559000	But you can play it at my house.
2559000	2562000	Especially considering how much those cartridges go for on eBay, you know?
2562000	2564000	Yeah, I won't tell you how cheap we got ours.
2564000	2567000	Well, you might have got lucky, too. Did you find it at a...
2567000	2569000	It was a long time ago.
2569000	2571000	Yeah, before the value...
2571000	2573000	Probably when we had the video game store.
2574000	2576000	So, anyway, this is out.
2576000	2579000	There was a special Nintendo Direct to go with it.
2579000	2585000	Some people taking surprise at the increased price because the game is $9.99 on the Wii U eShop.
2585000	2590000	It is not the normal, I'm using my quotey fingers, price of $7.99.
2590000	2595000	But to be honest, this isn't the first time we've seen a game priced higher than the bar.
2595000	2599000	I believe Mario 2 loss levels, or what they...
2599000	2604000	Super Mario 2, the Japanese version, was a dollar more than most NES games.
2604000	2609000	Because on the Wii, they did this whole week of import releases.
2609000	2612000	And, you know, Mario 2 is the big flagship of those, the original one.
2612000	2614000	And that was a dollar more.
2614000	2618000	The Final Fantasy games, I think, at least the Super Nintendo ones that they put out on Virtual Console,
2618000	2622000	those were a dollar, or maybe even two dollars more. I think they were a dollar more.
2622000	2623000	Squeenix tax.
2623000	2626000	Yeah, basically. Well, now this is, you know, Nintendo tax.
2626000	2628000	Both.
2628000	2632000	Well, so why are they charging the increased price? Because they can, honestly.
2632000	2634000	I mean...
2634000	2637000	Gotta make up that game some exclusive money somewhere.
2637000	2641000	I guess so. I mean, it's not like $9.99 is a ripoff,
2641000	2646000	but they are talking about that there's an enhanced value about the Earthbound Strategy Guide,
2646000	2649000	which is out there, and it's enhanced for the Wii U gamepad,
2649000	2653000	and you can actually view it on Nintendo's Earthbound site.
2653000	2657000	Which, you know, you press the little home button, go into the browser, and you can open up on the site.
2657000	2663000	I'm gonna be honest. I find that feature, and I'm using my quotey fingers,
2663000	2665000	I find that feature to be a little bit disingenuous.
2665000	2672000	I don't think that's really a feature, because you're just advertising a website, basically.
2672000	2677000	And to be honest, I could open up my internet browser and go to gamefacts.com
2677000	2680000	and pull up almost anything that's on Virtual Console.
2680000	2681000	I mean, I can do that.
2681000	2688000	That's cool that Nintendo did the optimized and scanned it in and made that or whatever,
2688000	2692000	but you technically don't have to own Earthbound to see that.
2692000	2696000	You know what I mean? That's not really value for buying the game.
2696000	2702000	So if you're gonna tell me that the $2 was for that, I'm gonna tell you that's a crock of shit.
2702000	2705000	Because that would be like me saying,
2705000	2711000	Oh, well, with every copy of Donkey Kong sold on the Virtual Console, you get a free voggenetwork.com.
2711000	2713000	Check it out.
2713000	2716000	It doesn't quite work for me.
2716000	2722000	I mean, cool. It would be neat if Nintendo would do more manuals and stuff,
2722000	2727000	but you know what would be even better is if instead of having to press the home button,
2727000	2733000	having to press the internet browser button, having to enter in earthbound.nintendo.com,
2733000	2736000	having to wait for the thing to load. You know what would be even better than that?
2736000	2742000	Just tapping the screen and having an extra button that says guide and then it just comes right up.
2742000	2747000	It's already downloaded to your Wii U. It's just right there. Instant.
2747000	2749000	No, it's even better.
2749000	2755000	That would again require Nintendo to get online and speed some things up a little bit.
2755000	2758000	I guess this is a baby step.
2758000	2765000	Did you know with your copy of Balloon Fight that you can actually get a free copy of Pornhub?
2765000	2770000	Free porn. With a Nintendo title. I mean, that's ridiculous.
2770000	2772000	But it's optimized.
2772000	2775000	Shadownextgen in chat at live.voggenetwork.com says,
2775000	2779000	The guide from Nintendo would most likely be better than what you will find on Game Facts.
2779000	2781000	No.
2781000	2787000	Graphically, yes. For the retro-minded in you, yes.
2787000	2792000	You know, again, for the whole tickling your retro tastes or whatever, yes.
2792000	2797000	But Game Facts will honestly be faster. That site was slow as hell when I was playing with it.
2797000	2801000	It's probably outsourced anyway, so it's probably going to be a Prima guide or something.
2801000	2803000	But...
2803000	2810000	No, no. Well, I mean, this was years ago, but every copy of Earthbound, when you bought it, it came in that bigger box.
2810000	2816000	I believe, I could be wrong, I believe it was a whole thing tied in to push Nintendo Power subscriptions.
2816000	2819000	Because, remember how Nintendo Power would do those guides?
2819000	2823000	If there was one for Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, I could be wrong.
2823000	2824000	Mario Paint.
2824000	2827000	But I thought Earthbound was technically one of those guides.
2827000	2831000	And that there were things in there to try to get you to get a Nintendo Power subscription.
2831000	2834000	I had the Mario Paint one, that was freaking sweet.
2834000	2838000	I'm having to think back almost 20 years here, but...
2838000	2840000	Anyhow.
2840000	2844000	Yeah, all sorts of pixel art in there for doing animated Yoshis and all sorts of fun stuff.
2844000	2851000	AlphaKnanogram says, the online US guide sucks, the Nintendo Europe site has the PDF to download.
2851000	2853000	And you put it on your iPad.
2853000	2855000	That's honestly how I've been doing a lot of playthroughs.
2855000	2860000	Not just Nintendo, but even 360 and Playstation 3 as well.
2860000	2862000	I pull up the thing on my iPad.
2862000	2864000	Works great.
2864000	2869000	And BlackWolf says, it was a Nintendo guide, not a Prima guide.
2869000	2871000	Could have still been outsourced though.
2872000	2875000	It didn't necessarily have to come in internally from Nintendo.
2878000	2881000	But they had the hotline, didn't they?
2881000	2883000	Oh, they still did at that time, yeah.
2883000	2886000	Oh yeah, the game counselors, absolutely.
2889000	2896000	To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, thunder.
2896000	2898000	Moving on, DarkSakura.
2898000	2900000	Yes, we do have some other news.
2901000	2906000	I'm sorry, I've been discussing certain old Exedy games with somebody.
2906000	2909000	Exedy games? That's really old.
2909000	2913000	Like Gorf? Wasn't Gorf an Exedy game?
2913000	2917000	Well, I'll go ahead and say it, but I won't say who I've been talking with or the reason why.
2917000	2918000	Yeah, yeah.
2918000	2919000	Venture.
2919000	2921000	Oh, yeah, you brought that up on the show before.
2921000	2924000	I think I've done Venture as a classic. If I haven't, I should.
2924000	2925000	I think you have.
2925000	2934000	Anyway, speaking of classic games, everybody has been messaging me this to show Dan, and Dan knows. Trust me.
2934000	2935000	Of course Dan knows.
2935000	2936000	Of course Dan knows.
2936000	2938000	It's nice that people think of you, though.
2938000	2946000	Thank you, everybody. But keep in mind, Dan used to run a site called Neo Strider's Strider Zone.
2946000	2952000	And it was one of two Strider sites that existed back in the days when people had websites on AOL.
2952000	2956000	He was probably sitting there, all of a sudden the hair on his arm went up. He's like, Strider news has been announced.
2956000	2965000	He turned red in the face, and like all of a sudden weird signals came from his head where he started accepting the vibe of Strider.
2965000	2966000	Did he cry?
2966000	2967000	As it flowed.
2967000	2968000	Did he cry? Was there a little shaking?
2968000	2970000	I think he peed a little.
2970000	2975000	Which I'm glad that he's not listening right now, so I love you, Dan.
2975000	2977000	What other embarrassing Dan stories do you want to tell?
2977000	2978000	Love you, mean it.
2978000	2982000	I did say that I was going to clone his liver and sell multiple copies on eBay.
2984000	2986000	Because livers are worth the money, man.
2987000	2990000	I told him if he ever pissed me off, I'd punch him until he peed blood.
2991000	2993000	You make that threat of a lot of people, though.
2993000	2994000	I do.
2994000	2995000	You can't just throw that around willy-nilly.
2995000	2999000	I only do that to people I care about. Rob, by the way.
2999000	3000000	Hey.
3000000	3003000	Anyway, so yeah, I mentioned Strider. It is Strider.
3003000	3011000	There is a version of Strider which is supposed to be a series reboot, from what I understand, like a redoing of the first game.
3011000	3015000	From what we could see of the trailer, it looked like the whole first level.
3015000	3019000	And it's being done by Double Helix, who is also working on Killer Instinct, so I don't know.
3019000	3024000	This looks like it would be a lot better than that Killer Instinct thing, so I have some high hopes.
3025000	3028000	Watching the gameplay, it was really, really cool.
3032000	3037000	He doesn't so much walk as Dash everywhere he goes. He runs with purpose.
3038000	3042000	Keep in mind, I loved Strider 2. I loved the updated thing.
3042000	3046000	I loved every appearance of Strider Hear You in Marvel vs. Capcom.
3047000	3050000	The various Marvel vs. Capcom's when he was playable.
3051000	3055000	And one of my favorite characters of all time, thanks to Dan, making me sit down and said,
3055000	3058000	Any person I marry is going to beat Strider.
3059000	3060000	On Genesis.
3060000	3061000	Which I have.
3061000	3064000	And finally beaten on arcade and beaten PlayStation version, blah, blah, blah.
3064000	3067000	And that last fight with the stupid master is bitch.
3068000	3069000	It's a pain in the ass.
3069000	3077000	But anyway, so yeah, we both have a lot of happy going on in our house because of Strider.
3077000	3079000	Do you even love Strider on the NES?
3080000	3082000	I'm going to tell you about Strider on the NES.
3083000	3084000	It's based off the manga.
3085000	3087000	So it is not the arcade game.
3087000	3091000	It's got this one jump that's like freaking impossible.
3091000	3094000	I think we own the game and I think Dan kind of likes it.
3094000	3096000	The infamous triangle jump.
3096000	3097000	The triangle jump, yes.
3097000	3101000	I do like the story in the game. I've read the manga.
3102000	3103000	I don't like playing it.
3104000	3109000	So I would much rather play the original Strider any day.
3110000	3111000	I loved Strider on the NES.
3111000	3112000	Because I didn't have a Genesis.
3112000	3114000	We weren't really a Sega household.
3114000	3115000	We were all Nintendo.
3115000	3117000	So I played Strider on the NES.
3117000	3118000	I really liked it.
3118000	3123000	And hearing that this new game is kind of Metroidvania-ish made me think of the NES version.
3123000	3126000	Not that the NES was really Metroidvania, but it had like the different stages.
3126000	3132000	The Nintendo Strider, I'm almost positive, was the same engine that DuckTales used.
3132000	3134000	Because they were very similar where you would select a stage.
3134000	3136000	Like you would go to the various areas.
3136000	3138000	And then, you know, you clear that.
3138000	3142000	Well, and other games use that same formula too.
3142000	3151000	But my big thing is that I just didn't enjoy playing it as much as I did the original.
3151000	3154000	And keep in mind, I didn't grow up with a Genesis.
3154000	3156000	I played Strider in the arcade a couple of times.
3156000	3157000	And it wasn't really my thing.
3157000	3159000	And I didn't play it on Nintendo.
3159000	3161000	But like I said, Dan sat me down and said,
3161000	3163000	Any woman I marry is going to play Strider.
3164000	3170000	So I've beaten Ghosts N Goblins 2, which made me want to cry tears of blood.
3170000	3172000	But Strider, at least, is a fun game.
3172000	3175000	And, you know, he actually told me a little bit of trivia about that too.
3175000	3177000	Is that it was going to be a regular cartridge.
3177000	3179000	But because they wanted to put the Amazon level in it,
3179000	3181000	They actually upped the memory in it.
3181000	3183000	So they could include the Amazon level and have the music and everything.
3183000	3184000	Nice.
3184000	3186000	Yeah. So.
3186000	3191000	So this news fills a certain hole in your heart that not even Moon Diver could fill, right?
3191000	3194000	Moon Diver was a good game.
3194000	3198000	I mean, it's a spiritual successor in the series.
3198000	3200000	But we need to have Strider.
3200000	3202000	No one.
3202000	3207000	And what I'm kind of hoping is that with this we get some of the elements from Strider 2.
3207000	3209000	Like we see Hien.
3209000	3212000	You know, because I actually really like to play through the game with Hien.
3212000	3213000	That was really fun.
3213000	3215000	The guy who had two cyphers.
3215000	3216000	It was really cool.
3216000	3219000	But I have high hopes for this.
3219000	3222000	It looks pretty. It looks like it plays solidly.
3222000	3226000	The backgrounds were amazing. The music was amazing.
3226000	3229000	And it was the same first level that I heard.
3229000	3232000	So I will keep my fingers crossed.
3232000	3236000	A lot of people have been frowning a little bit hearing who's developing this.
3236000	3239000	Because, you know, the new Killer Instinct game.
3239000	3243000	Which I don't know. I mean, it's hard to judge a game that's not even out.
3243000	3244000	I don't know.
3244000	3247000	But Silent Hill Homecoming has a lot of people kind of nervous.
3247000	3249000	But, you know, I don't know if it's...
3249000	3251000	We really have to wait until the game's out.
3251000	3255000	I mean, WayForward does a lot of great retro updates now.
3255000	3257000	Dude, they made Ping Pals if I remember right.
3257000	3261000	So that game was literally the worst handheld game in history.
3261000	3267000	So if, you know, that company can do better after their first couple attempts.
3267000	3269000	I'm willing to give these guys a chance.
3269000	3275000	And, like I said, I looked at the trailer and it really would be hard to screw up Strider.
3275000	3278000	Unless there were major timing and physics issues.
3278000	3281000	Other than that, it really looked very solid.
3281000	3285000	And all they have to do is take the timing physics from the original.
3285000	3287000	And they would know exactly how to do it.
3287000	3290000	And, you know, like I said, I've played other versions of Strider.
3290000	3292000	We actually have the PC Engine version.
3292000	3295000	Which we can't play because we don't have the card for it.
3295000	3297000	The arcade card.
3297000	3300000	But that one even...
3300000	3302000	I don't think it would be too hard. I really don't think it would be too hard.
3302000	3306000	They'd have to really screw up, like I said, timing and physics to ruin the game.
3306000	3310000	Or, you know, maybe really shitty voice acting.
3310000	3312000	Which, it can't get...
3312000	3314000	Even the first game actually had pretty...
3314000	3316000	The original had pretty decent voice acting in it.
3316000	3320000	It was all in whatever the native language of whoever the character was.
3320000	3322000	But it has the best line in it.
3322000	3324000	I gotcha.
3324000	3325000	The one guy.
3325000	3329000	And the new one's like, I'm Strider! I wanna hit you with my sword!
3329000	3331000	They'd be like, Hi! I hear you!
3331000	3333000	Wow.
3333000	3337000	They better give him the uber-bishy voice, you know?
3337000	3341000	I'm surprised they waited to announce this for Comic-Con.
3341000	3344000	That they didn't bring this out at E3.
3344000	3346000	I mean, maybe it just wasn't ready, but...
3346000	3350000	It's one of the games that the fans have been dying to get a new game of...
3350000	3353000	Sorry Mega Man! You guys fucking suck!
3353000	3357000	Hey! Enjoy the Game Boy games on 3DS!
3357000	3359000	The Mega Man thing I think is fight now.
3361000	3367000	But I'm actually a little bit more excited about Strider than I am about a Mega Man game, so...
3367000	3370000	I think a Mega Man project's in the works.
3370000	3374000	But I think with this Strider news and so forth, and Mega Man and Smash...
3374000	3377000	I think there'll be something next year.
3377000	3379000	But, I mean, easy to say, right?
3379000	3382000	Any strange analyst can say that.
3382000	3384000	Alright, let's move on. Loki.
3384000	3388000	You'll be really awesome as if they do a new Mega Man game that's done by...
3388000	3391000	Was it WayForward, actually? I think.
3391000	3394000	There were comments to that in the chatroom, too.
3394000	3398000	It'll suck, whatever it is, I'm sure. They can't do it.
3398000	3400000	If the DuckTales thing goes well, you never know.
3400000	3402000	That looks cool.
3402000	3405000	Anyways, so NCAA. There was a bit of drama with that.
3405000	3412000	Considering that the game just came out, apparently NCAA is not renewing its contract with EA.
3412000	3417000	This'll be, I guess, the last year that it'll be called NCAA Football 14.
3417000	3421000	However, and I know they have a lawsuit against them.
3421000	3424000	And this is from 2008.
3424000	3427000	Basically saying that...
3427000	3429000	I want to say it was because they're using the...
3429000	3436000	They've never licensed the use of current student athlete names, images, or likenesses.
3436000	3444000	I think the whole reason that they're not renewing their contract with them is they're trying to distance themselves from EA.
3444000	3449000	Because EA is kind of going around them and putting these students in the game.
3449000	3454000	And I guess EA is still going to be making college football games.
3454000	3460000	It'll just probably be called EA Sports College Football 15 next year or something like that.
3460000	3469000	And, of course, you know, they're just saying that, once again, even some attorneys that are dealing with the whole lawsuit are saying,
3469000	3471000	yeah, it's basically...
3471000	3480000	The announcement makes it plain that NCAA is attempting to mitigate the damages by ducking its responsibilities.
3480000	3493000	They say that our suit illustrates the cabal between NCAA and EA has exploited student athletes for years using their images in video games without compensation.
3493000	3494000	Well, that sounds like EA.
3494000	3506000	While we are heartened that they've stopped the practice, we believe that they owe students or student athletes a great deal more than implied promise to stop stealing their images.
3506000	3511000	So how's that going to work next year? Are they actually going to stop using the student images?
3511000	3515000	So it's just going to be like generic people on a team type thing?
3515000	3518000	Are we going like EA Sports Tech Mobile here?
3518000	3520000	I mean, how's that going to work?
3520000	3522000	So I don't know.
3522000	3524000	Whatever.
3524000	3529000	And I even read in chat or something that they were saying that next year is going to be all next gen anyways.
3529000	3532000	No current gen version of the game.
3532000	3535000	Could be a chance to kind of re reboot, reinvent things.
3535000	3539000	It's interesting to see if 2K comes back with a college football game.
3539000	3551000	Although the last one was that remember how they tried to do that whole American football or I forget what their one had like this weird like lineup of people in there and stuff and fake teams and stuff.
3551000	3553000	And that didn't work out too well.
3553000	3556000	But it'd be kind of neat to see 2K come back and do new.
3557000	3560000	How important is it to have the actual people in the game?
3560000	3564000	I mean, I don't play a whole lot of sports games, but it's never really mattered to me.
3564000	3566000	Yeah, the games I played games.
3566000	3569000	So, you know, you want to play as your favorite players and stuff.
3569000	3575000	And so which I really, I realized the NCAA games didn't actually have the player.
3575000	3578000	Well, I mean, they were all there except in name.
3578000	3579000	I mean, that's that's what it was, right?
3579000	3582000	Like their stats were what you would expect to see.
3582000	3586000	Their looks were what you would expect to see, you know, with subtle changes.
3586000	3588000	Just the names weren't there, you know?
3588000	3600000	Yeah, I think it's just they want, you know, they just like, you know, if you're playing an NBA game, you'd want to have, you know, they pay those players to use their likenesses and stuff in the game.
3600000	3603000	So the thing is, why aren't they paying these college students?
3603000	3604000	Because they think they can get away with it.
3604000	3606000	Oh, what's a college student going to do?
3606000	3607000	Try to sue me?
3607000	3608000	You're broke.
3608000	3609000	I mean, seriously.
3609000	3611000	Well, they can't they can't profit.
3611000	3613000	It's NCAA regulations that they can't.
3613000	3616000	NCAA is saying that they never license that stuff to them.
3616000	3622000	They're basically saying, oh, well, we didn't do this, but they're still getting this stuff in the game anyway.
3622000	3624000	Well, Bobby and Chad wants to clarify.
3624000	3627000	Bobby Black Wolf says they only lost the NCAA name.
3627000	3628000	Nothing else.
3628000	3630000	The colleges and bowls and stadiums and stuff are still EA.
3630000	3633000	The only thing they lost is the NCAA name and the NCAA logo.
3633000	3634000	That's it.
3634000	3636000	Well, then that won't affect anything.
3636000	3637000	You don't think?
3637000	3638000	I don't think.
3638000	3640000	I don't think it'll be a big deal either.
3640000	3642000	I think at the end of the day, a good game is a good game.
3642000	3645000	Like I love Tecmo Bowl is like my favorite football game.
3645000	3647000	And it didn't really have any of that.
3647000	3651000	So, you know, anyhow.
3651000	3655000	Moving on.
3655000	3658000	Lots of gaming things being shown at Comic-Con.
3658000	3661000	Now, I know gaming kind of comes up every year at Comic-Con.
3661000	3664000	But it definitely seems like there's more of it this year than we usually see.
3664000	3667000	And that probably has something to do with the fact that we have new consoles coming this year.
3667000	3673000	So obviously the companies want to push that to the potential buying audience of which a lot of them are at Comic-Con right now.
3673000	3675000	Although I'm not there.
3675000	3679000	But Sony is at Comic-Con with the PlayStation 4.
3679000	3686000	They have NAC and Drive Club out there open for play, letting the public experience PlayStation 4.
3686000	3689000	I think it would be a safe bet to say those games will show up.
3689000	3692000	Everything you're hearing here, these games will get in a truck and move to PAX in a couple weeks.
3692000	3695000	Absolutely.
3695000	3699000	Octodad, excuse me, I guess is part of PlayStation 4 as well.
3699000	3702000	Gran Turismo 6 is also there even though technically that's not next gen.
3702000	3704000	It's still there.
3704000	3706000	It still looks nice.
3706000	3708000	Yeah.
3708000	3711000	Microsoft has Rise with the Y, Rise and Killer Instinct out there on the floor.
3711000	3714000	Killer Instinct drawing pretty good.
3714000	3716000	Apparently Rise is too.
3716000	3722000	Apparently other games being shown out there, Dead Rising 3, Assassin's Creed 4, and Watch Dogs.
3722000	3724000	All there at Comic-Con.
3724000	3726000	That's just a taste.
3726000	3728000	That's just some of the stuff that involves next gen and the big companies.
3728000	3732000	So is there any comics to be found at Comic-Con out of curiosity?
3732000	3734000	Marvel's got a whole big thing.
3734000	3736000	No, I know.
3736000	3738000	Well, you know, they actually did announce the next Avengers movie.
3738000	3740000	Yeah, but that's a movie.
3740000	3742000	It's not a comic.
3742000	3744000	Yeah, but it's still Marvel.
3744000	3746000	And why are they fucking going with Age of Ultron?
3746000	3748000	Sorry.
3748000	3750000	Not a fan?
3750000	3752000	I'm not a fan of Ultron.
3752000	3754000	And they're doing the same thing in the comics.
3754000	3756000	They tease Thanos.
3756000	3758000	So here I go talking about movies on the video game podcast.
3758000	3760000	Sorry.
3760000	3762000	I went to go see This is the End last night.
3762000	3764000	It was funny.
3764000	3766000	It was one of those movies that was so stupid.
3766000	3768000	It's seriously stupid.
3768000	3770000	It was awesome.
3770000	3772000	But to the point where it's actually really funny.
3772000	3774000	It's so stupid you can't help but laugh.
3774000	3776000	Like a lot of stoner comedies are.
3776000	3778000	It was great.
3778000	3780000	Yeah, I had a good time. It was good.
3780000	3782000	But I got home.
3782000	3784000	In the first news that greets me when I yell,
3784000	3786000	the Superman sequel will have Batman in it.
3786000	3788000	They're doing the Superman vs. Batman thing that was in one of the comics.
3788000	3790000	I'm just like,
3790000	3792000	stop.
3792000	3794000	Stop.
3794000	3796000	And I know this is a whole
3796000	3798000	to build up to the Justice League movie
3798000	3800000	that they have to do.
3800000	3802000	Because Marvel's got the Avengers.
3802000	3804000	So now DC's got to do this.
3804000	3806000	But it's like, no.
3806000	3808000	No. You do not get to do
3808000	3810000	a Justice League movie
3810000	3812000	until you fucking do a Wonder Woman movie.
3812000	3814000	You don't get to debut her.
3814000	3816000	No. She needs her own movie.
3816000	3818000	And it needs to be good. Because if it sucks,
3818000	3820000	you don't get to do a Justice League movie.
3820000	3822000	And I don't.
3822000	3824000	God, the whole idea of Batman and Superman is just.
3824000	3826000	I don't. I don't like that.
3826000	3828000	I don't know. Like, I get that it's based on a comic
3828000	3830000	and it was a real thing and everything, but I don't know.
3830000	3832000	Maybe there's just that part of me that holds out hope
3832000	3834000	for a fourth Bale Batman movie,
3834000	3836000	which I realize they probably couldn't
3836000	3838000	do because of the story and everything, but
3838000	3840000	dammit, there's always a way.
3840000	3842000	There's always a way. I want to see a
3842000	3844000	sequel to Suburban Commando, but instead
3844000	3846000	of having Hulk Hogan in the movie, it'll be
3846000	3848000	Christian Bale Batman, and he'll be like
3848000	3850000	going around the neighborhood driving a car.
3850000	3852000	Just a regular car. Not the Batmobile. Just like
3852000	3854000	calling the people. You know, that'd be fun.
3854000	3856000	Maybe babysitting some
3856000	3858000	kids.
3858000	3860000	There's
3860000	3862000	some Marvel versus DC chat
3862000	3864000	going on in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
3864000	3866000	And all the Marvel people are right.
3866000	3868000	Brad from Pod Culture says,
3868000	3870000	you should ask if any good comics are there. Who reads
3870000	3872000	Marvel? People with taste.
3872000	3874000	Snap.
3874000	3876000	Slidekick says, I've always preferred Marvel
3876000	3878000	for superheroes. People, please.
3878000	3880000	There's good and bad on
3880000	3882000	both sides. There's good and bad on
3882000	3884000	both sides. Yes, check out Rocket Raccoon.
3884000	3886000	It's all about image, anyways.
3886000	3888000	I will say,
3888000	3890000	I don't watch a lot of
3890000	3892000	TV, although
3892000	3894000	I have been watching Orange is the New Black based on
3894000	3896000	Recommendation, that Netflix show, but
3896000	3898000	I'm stupid looking forward to
3898000	3900000	the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. TV show.
3900000	3902000	Yeah, me too. I think it's kind of rad that
3902000	3904000	they're doing this big budget TV show.
3904000	3906000	I'm still super pissed off that there is
3906000	3908000	still not AKA Jessica Jones.
3908000	3910000	You heard at Comic-Con,
3910000	3912000	I don't know, I guess there was
3912000	3914000	a panel or something with David Covington
3914000	3916000	and the whole X-Files crew and stuff, but he wants to
3916000	3918000	bring that back. I'm like, yes.
3918000	3920000	Please. That would be fantastic.
3920000	3922000	I still haven't seen the second movie, which I hear
3922000	3924000	is really dumb, but
3924000	3926000	I would love to have them just
3926000	3928000	bring it back. I mean, they're both not really fucking
3928000	3930000	doing anything. I mean, just bring back
3930000	3932000	a whole new series and just set it
3932000	3934000	20 years later and
3934000	3936000	pick it up from where it, you know,
3936000	3938000	where it left off. That'd be fantastic.
3942000	3944000	Alright.
3944000	3946000	Let's move on with more news.
3946000	3948000	Classic game of the week,
3948000	3950000	still a little bit away, and release date's coming up
3950000	3952000	right after this. TarSaga.
3952000	3954000	Ready to friend some butt?
3956000	3958000	What? I explained that to Dan, by the way.
3958000	3960000	He's like, you guys are weird.
3960000	3962000	So Nintendo has trademarked
3962000	3964000	two game names that
3964000	3966000	will really do hint to
3966000	3968000	Seaman.
3968000	3970000	They have
3970000	3972000	the rights to Mysterious Pet
3972000	3974000	Legend of the Fish with a Human Face
3974000	3976000	and Mysterious Partner
3976000	3978000	Legend of the Fish with a Human Face.
3978000	3980000	And it was
3980000	3982000	registered in
3982000	3984000	Japan. It was
3984000	3986000	now, there have been
3986000	3988000	some goings
3988000	3990000	on with the creator of
3990000	3992000	Seaman, who is Yut Saito,
3992000	3994000	who did work with
3994000	3996000	Nintendo
3996000	3998000	for GameCube content. That was a
3998000	4000000	pinball game,
4000000	4002000	Odama, and
4002000	4004000	the Guild 101
4004000	4006000	thing,
4006000	4008000	Air Reporter. So
4008000	4010000	it could be possible that we may be seeing
4010000	4012000	another Seaman. They'd have to put out
4012000	4014000	a micro, well, I guess the microphone's already built into the
4014000	4016000	controller, so who knows?
4016000	4018000	On both the 3DS and
4018000	4020000	on the, well,
4020000	4022000	3DSDS and
4022000	4024000	Wii U.
4024000	4026000	I will not friend his butt, and actually it doesn't sound
4026000	4028000	very exciting, but
4028000	4030000	sure, why not?
4032000	4034000	I think that butt friending should be
4034000	4036000	a thing.
4036000	4038000	Click to butt friend. I think there's a lot
4038000	4040000	of people that don't get that joke, and I'm trying
4040000	4042000	to find that original YouTube.
4042000	4044000	Yeah, that was a while back.
4044000	4046000	Was it a Let's Play? That was a long time ago.
4046000	4048000	Some dude doing a Let's Play with that
4048000	4050000	game, Seaman. Yeah.
4050000	4052000	I think it was, like,
4052000	4054000	Seaman gameplay, or, yeah, Let's
4054000	4056000	Play.
4056000	4058000	I'm assuming Tigerclaw could probably find
4058000	4060000	it, because he could find it. Yeah, Tigerclaw, do your job.
4060000	4062000	Find us the link.
4062000	4064000	Hopefully. Friend his butt for us.
4064000	4066000	Let me Tigerclaw that for you.
4066000	4068000	It was, like, asking
4068000	4070000	about birthdays, and it was like,
4070000	4072000	are we friends?
4072000	4074000	I'll friend your butt.
4074000	4076000	Wait, wait.
4076000	4078000	I might have found it.
4078000	4080000	I might have beat Tigerclaw out of this.
4080000	4082000	That's it.
4082000	4084000	Okay, wait.
4084000	4086000	Let me give credit where credit is due.
4086000	4088000	Oh, gotta love this
4088000	4090000	username. Ebola World
4090000	4092000	is the user that did this.
4092000	4094000	You just need to click like.
4094000	4096000	So, what
4096000	4098000	month is your birthday in?
4098000	4100000	October.
4100000	4102000	You were born in October?
4102000	4104000	No, it doesn't.
4104000	4106000	Let's try that again.
4106000	4108000	In what month
4108000	4110000	were you
4110000	4112000	born?
4112000	4114000	October.
4114000	4116000	You were born in October?
4116000	4118000	Yes.
4118000	4120000	I wonder if people would say you're a
4120000	4122000	trick, or a treat?
4122000	4124000	Treat.
4124000	4126000	Like
4126000	4128000	the spice?
4128000	4130000	Yes.
4130000	4132000	Well, you can
4132000	4134000	look, but don't touch.
4134000	4136000	I don't want to touch
4136000	4138000	you.
4138000	4140000	What
4140000	4142000	do you want?
4142000	4144000	To touch you.
4144000	4146000	I don't know that word.
4146000	4148000	You just said it.
4148000	4150000	So, what day is your
4150000	4152000	birthday on?
4152000	4154000	The second.
4154000	4156000	The second?
4156000	4158000	Yes, bitch.
4158000	4160000	Mahatma Gandhi was also
4160000	4162000	born on October 2nd.
4162000	4164000	This honestly sounds like me talking to
4164000	4166000	Siri.
4166000	4168000	I hope you are as peaceful as he.
4168000	4170000	I would loathe
4170000	4172000	to be stuck in here with
4172000	4174000	an aggressive human being.
4174000	4176000	Fuck you.
4178000	4180000	Listen, I
4180000	4182000	don't know if our relationship
4182000	4184000	can handle
4184000	4186000	this, you know?
4186000	4188000	Besides, what would the neighbors think?
4188000	4190000	Fuck them.
4192000	4194000	Fuck them.
4194000	4196000	Hey, why all the noise?
4198000	4200000	Your mama.
4200000	4202000	What?
4202000	4204000	Your mama.
4204000	4206000	Mama?
4206000	4208000	Nope,
4208000	4210000	I'm just fine.
4210000	4212000	Wait.
4212000	4214000	Sorry, I'm busy.
4214000	4216000	You don't look busy.
4236000	4238000	I'll friend your butt.
4238000	4240000	Are you coming
4240000	4242000	on to me?
4242000	4244000	There, there it is.
4244000	4246000	Two minutes
4246000	4248000	and thirty seconds later. Again, credit to
4248000	4250000	YouTube user EbolaWorld for that.
4250000	4252000	Totally just stole that there. But that's where that
4252000	4254000	joke comes from, the whole I'll friend your butt thing, which
4254000	4256000	is great. So, lots of
4256000	4258000	let's plays, I'm sure, coming.
4258000	4260000	If this happens to be true, which I kind of
4260000	4262000	hope it is, that would be great.
4262000	4264000	You know, we actually did
4264000	4266000	play the game to completion
4266000	4268000	and set our little frogman free.
4268000	4270000	And then Dan's like,
4270000	4272000	I wonder if he's still there.
4272000	4274000	Well, our
4274000	4276000	we still have our save files intact.
4276000	4278000	So. Nice.
4278000	4280000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check
4280000	4282000	out some release dates of some games coming
4282000	4284000	out a lot sooner than any
4284000	4286000	C-Man reboot.
4286000	4288000	You know, we could
4288000	4290000	definitely use a C-Man
4290000	4292000	reboot this week because all we have is
4292000	4294000	the Smurfs 2.
4294000	4296000	The official game.
4296000	4298000	Let's check Boogaloo.
4298000	4300000	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
4300000	4302000	Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.
4302000	4304000	You said Wii-Wii.
4304000	4306000	I said Wii-Wii U.
4310000	4312000	Alright, then I guess we travel to Japan.
4312000	4314000	That was quick. Looking at some of the
4314000	4316000	release dates in Japan. On the PlayStation 3
4316000	4318000	this week, quite a bit actually,
4318000	4320000	Dragon's Crown, Ketsuie,
4320000	4322000	Kizuna, Jigoko Tachi Extra
4322000	4324000	in regular and limited edition.
4324000	4326000	Majo Tohai Kihei comes out
4326000	4328000	as well in regular and limited.
4328000	4330000	Also, Race Driver Grid 2 and
4330000	4332000	X-Blade Code Embryo.
4332000	4334000	And, Zone of the Enders HD
4334000	4336000	edition gets a price reduction this week.
4336000	4338000	So. Lots and lots
4338000	4340000	of releases there.
4340000	4342000	Also, going to
4342000	4344000	on the Xbox 360
4344000	4348000	I don't think there's
4348000	4350000	really anything
4350000	4352000	on the 360. I mean, what did you expect?
4352000	4354000	Haha. Also, looking at
4354000	4356000	the PlayStation Vita.
4358000	4360000	Let's see. Dragon's Crown
4360000	4362000	as well as
4362000	4364000	X-Blaze Code Embryo.
4364000	4366000	Next Rev Aiken
4366000	4368000	and Dragon's Crown Famitsu
4368000	4370000	pack. Like a Famitsu edition
4370000	4372000	on the PlayStation Vita this week.
4372000	4374000	And,
4374000	4376000	looking at the, let's see
4376000	4378000	on the Wii U. The Wii U does
4378000	4380000	have Lego City Undercover, getting its Japanese
4380000	4382000	release this week. And, also
4382000	4384000	a new GamePad battery pack
4384000	4386000	which I think was reported on a couple weeks ago. That is
4386000	4388000	actually getting its release in Japan this week
4388000	4390000	as far as peripherals go.
4390000	4392000	Going to the 3DS.
4392000	4394000	Gaikuten Saiban
4394000	4396000	5 is finally released
4396000	4398000	from Capcom. And, that
4398000	4400000	is the Phoenix Wright game, basically.
4400000	4402000	That's the one with Apollo and all the
4402000	4404000	folks in it. Is that the one that's rated
4404000	4406000	M, I think I heard?
4406000	4408000	I don't think so.
4408000	4410000	For its release over here.
4410000	4412000	Well, anyway, that is out
4412000	4414000	in Japan this week and there's a whole lot of peripherals
4414000	4416000	to come with that. Fantasy Life
4416000	4418000	Link and Chibi Devil 2
4418000	4420000	Mahou no Yume Ihon.
4420000	4422000	To.
4422000	4424000	Is that? No.
4424000	4426000	No, not To.
4426000	4428000	Beast Saga Saikyuu
4428000	4430000	Gekutosu Coliseum
4430000	4432000	comes out on the 3DS this week.
4432000	4434000	It's a busy week in Japan. That's interesting.
4434000	4436000	Why? Hmm. Now, I've seen
4436000	4438000	that before somewhere, but I don't know.
4440000	4442000	And lastly, yes, there are still
4442000	4444000	PCP, or, PCP,
4444000	4446000	PSP games coming.
4446000	4448000	Daya no Kuni no Alice
4448000	4450000	Wonderful Mirror World. I wonder if that's
4450000	4452000	based off Alice in Wonderland type of game.
4452000	4454000	I'm sure it is. Or, Through the Looking Glass.
4454000	4456000	Like an anime to, oh yeah, see, look.
4456000	4458000	The Mad Hatter is a
4458000	4460000	sexy thing. That's the March Hare.
4460000	4462000	Well, the Mad Hatter is right behind him.
4462000	4464000	They're all sexy.
4464000	4466000	Like, you know,
4466000	4468000	anime style. And, Toki no
4468000	4470000	Keizuna Hanomisubi
4470000	4472000	Tezuri comes out in regular and
4472000	4474000	limited edition. And there's a twin pack as well.
4474000	4476000	Lots of games.
4476000	4478000	Not so many for the UK.
4478000	4480000	On the 22nd, we have RuneScape 3
4480000	4482000	for PC. On the 25th,
4482000	4484000	I have no idea how this
4484000	4486000	is supposed to say.
4486000	4488000	Rimmed Capsule. Is that it?
4488000	4490000	Rimmed Capsule on iPad, Android, and iPhone.
4490000	4492000	Shadowrun Returns for iPad,
4492000	4494000	Android, Mac, and PC.
4494000	4496000	And on the 26th, we have Pikmin 3 for Wii U.
4496000	4498000	It's over.
4500000	4502000	Nothing else.
4502000	4504000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys
4504000	4506000	than the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.
4506000	4508000	Okay, this is kind of ridiculous.
4508000	4510000	You know,
4510000	4512000	a lot of people
4512000	4514000	would say that the Xbox One
4514000	4516000	might be a little rushed, or even some of these
4516000	4518000	next gen systems. But,
4518000	4520000	there was some
4520000	4522000	news that came out
4522000	4524000	regarding Forza Motorsport 5.
4524000	4526000	Saying that the game was
4526000	4528000	going to require a one-time
4528000	4530000	download before it can be played.
4530000	4532000	And that they were basically
4532000	4534000	um, it's such
4534000	4536000	a crunch for
4536000	4538000	you know, time, that
4538000	4540000	they were putting the base,
4540000	4542000	you know, kind of the framework of the game together,
4542000	4544000	they're getting that press to disk, and then
4544000	4546000	they were going to be working
4546000	4548000	on the tracks
4548000	4550000	up until launch.
4550000	4552000	And so basically, you would
4552000	4554000	have to buy the game,
4554000	4556000	and then you'd have to download the rest
4556000	4558000	um, you know,
4558000	4560000	when you first put the game in the system.
4560000	4562000	So you would need to be connected to the internet.
4562000	4564000	Now,
4564000	4566000	of course, there's been some back and forth
4566000	4568000	about it. They said, you know, I guess
4568000	4570000	Turn 10's Dan Greenwald,
4570000	4572000	he changed his statement
4572000	4574000	saying that
4574000	4576000	the requirement
4576000	4578000	of a connection to Xbox Live before
4578000	4580000	playing is not the plan.
4580000	4582000	However, when or if the game requires
4582000	4584000	an internet connection for
4584000	4586000	single player content, it's still not clear.
4586000	4588000	So...
4590000	4592000	I don't know. Is that how they were gonna
4592000	4594000	I mean, that is getting ridiculous.
4594000	4596000	You know, now where these games ship
4596000	4598000	and there's not a whole ton of testing, and then they have
4598000	4600000	this day one patch or whatever that fixes some
4600000	4602000	bugs, which is fine. I understand that
4602000	4604000	I appreciate there is bug fixing being
4604000	4606000	done between, you know, mastering the disk
4606000	4608000	and actually launching it and stuff, but
4608000	4610000	when you get to the point where the game is
4610000	4612000	literally not done, it is
4612000	4614000	admitted to be
4614000	4616000	it is not done. The game is
4616000	4618000	not done, and now
4618000	4620000	they need to put it on
4620000	4622000	disk so that, you know,
4622000	4624000	you download the rest of the content later because
4624000	4626000	they want to hit that launch
4626000	4628000	window or whatever.
4628000	4630000	That's ridiculous. That is
4630000	4632000	absolutely ridiculous, and I'm sorry.
4632000	4634000	I just...
4634000	4636000	Is this why they wanted this whole digital
4636000	4638000	system in the first place, is so that
4638000	4640000	they could literally, you know,
4640000	4642000	ship unfinished products, but hey, whatever
4642000	4644000	you just download the rest later.
4644000	4646000	Is that how it's supposed to work?
4646000	4648000	Because what if you don't have an internet connection?
4648000	4650000	The game is fucking useless. Are they gonna advertise
4650000	4652000	this on the box that the game is gonna require
4652000	4654000	a, you know,
4654000	4656000	a connection to download the thing?
4656000	4658000	What's the point? I just don't understand.
4660000	4662000	That really sucks
4662000	4664000	for those people that don't
4664000	4666000	have the internet connection, which was a big
4666000	4668000	part of the push to get Xbox One
4668000	4670000	to reverse their policies to begin with. And it's not even
4670000	4672000	the internet connection thing. Let's just skip
4672000	4674000	the whole, like, people that don't have internet,
4674000	4676000	okay? Because a lot of people do have internet.
4676000	4678000	It's still gonna take
4678000	4680000	a long time to download the rest of the content
4680000	4682000	for that game. I mean,
4682000	4684000	you know DLC and stuff that includes
4684000	4686000	like actual new art assets
4686000	4688000	and stuff, or at least a few hundred
4688000	4690000	meg. And when you're talking that, you
4690000	4692000	know, let's just assume that
4692000	4694000	the majority of the tracks aren't on the game.
4694000	4696000	You're talking like a multi-gig
4696000	4698000	download that even on
4698000	4700000	a somewhat decent
4700000	4702000	you know,
4702000	4704000	somewhat decent
4704000	4706000	I guess bandwidth or whatever. That's gonna
4706000	4708000	take at least an hour
4708000	4710000	to download. Are you gonna really wanna have
4710000	4712000	to deal with that bullshit?
4712000	4714000	You know, that you have to download a big portion
4714000	4716000	of the game in the first place to
4716000	4718000	be able to even play the single player campaign?
4718000	4720000	I think that's just kind of ridiculous.
4720000	4722000	What if we even would do that?
4722000	4724000	I don't know.
4724000	4726000	And is this something that says,
4726000	4728000	okay, yeah, we're gonna have
4728000	4730000	you know, this extra
4730000	4732000	content that we're building up to launch.
4732000	4734000	Does that mean that later on, after it
4734000	4736000	launches, that they're gonna put all that content
4736000	4738000	onto the disc later on?
4738000	4740000	Are they gonna do that, or are they just gonna
4740000	4742000	say, eh, fuck it, or whatever?
4744000	4746000	I think this is
4746000	4748000	too much of the letting the
4748000	4750000	day one patch fix your problems.
4750000	4752000	Dude, if this game isn't ready at launch,
4752000	4754000	then don't launch it with it.
4754000	4756000	Launch it a couple weeks later. It's fine.
4756000	4758000	Because you're already gonna have games coming out,
4758000	4760000	so what if it doesn't come out day one?
4760000	4762000	That's okay. It's sometimes good to have things
4762000	4764000	a little later, too. I mean, like, you know, Infamous
4764000	4766000	is- The Wii U could've used that.
4766000	4768000	Yeah, Infamous isn't coming out day one and stuff,
4768000	4770000	and I just don't understand
4770000	4772000	why they wouldn't push it.
4772000	4774000	I wanna say that a lot
4774000	4776000	of release dates for games
4776000	4778000	have to do with money and advertising.
4778000	4780000	With advertising,
4780000	4782000	with deals
4782000	4784000	with distributors. I really
4784000	4786000	think that that's where a lot of it comes into. So they set
4786000	4788000	this date that may or may
4788000	4790000	not be realistic,
4790000	4792000	and don't want to violate that date,
4792000	4794000	so they go ahead and ship and keep
4794000	4796000	working on it so that they have the patches ready.
4796000	4798000	That's my thought on why they do that, but
4798000	4800000	I still- I would personally prefer
4800000	4802000	them to wait. They can ship the data,
4802000	4804000	but I understand, yeah, that people plan
4804000	4806000	ahead for advertising, but
4806000	4808000	it's- they're planning holiday
4808000	4810000	advertisements and stuff.
4810000	4812000	It's a little closer than now.
4812000	4814000	I mean, now is-
4814000	4816000	you know, that's quite a ways
4816000	4818000	away from launch. You know, whereas
4818000	4820000	holiday advertisements and stuff, they probably want to
4820000	4822000	nail that down maybe by September
4822000	4824000	or something. You know, a couple months out.
4824000	4826000	I just think that, you know,
4826000	4828000	it's not gonna be ready, and they know it
4828000	4830000	now. They know right now their plan
4830000	4832000	is not gonna ship the game complete.
4832000	4834000	That's a big problem
4834000	4836000	if you know that you're not gonna hit your launch
4836000	4838000	and you're already, you know, how many months out?
4838000	4840000	Just push it. Just push the game
4840000	4842000	if it's not gonna be ready. Now, the question is
4842000	4844000	are other games gonna be like this?
4844000	4846000	Are we gonna see the same thing with Rise
4846000	4848000	because they've rushed the launch
4848000	4850000	for this system.
4850000	4852000	Has Rise been worked on for quite some time now?
4852000	4854000	It doesn't matter. I don't care. I mean,
4854000	4856000	there's been games that have shipped
4856000	4858000	incomplete, you know, before,
4858000	4860000	so I'm just not-
4860000	4862000	I don't know. It's
4862000	4864000	disheartening, I guess.
4864000	4866000	But, you know, whatever, they're not gonna tell anybody
4866000	4868000	about it, so. Well,
4868000	4870000	I guess they did. That's kind of weird. They probably
4870000	4872000	won't tell the general public about it.
4872000	4874000	It won't be on the, you know, box saying
4874000	4876000	hey, you need to connect to the internet to play this.
4876000	4878000	It's all incentives. Alright. Well, here's
4878000	4880000	a game I'm sure they will have no problem delaying
4880000	4882000	until it's damn near perfect, although
4882000	4884000	I mean, sometimes this game gets bugs too.
4884000	4886000	There was a pretty infamous one
4886000	4888000	on the Wii release of Zelda.
4888000	4890000	And, come on, we all
4890000	4892000	know that there's gonna be a Wii U game
4892000	4894000	or a Zelda game on the Wii U.
4894000	4896000	We all know that's something that's gotta happen.
4896000	4898000	Maybe something revealed next year. Who knows.
4898000	4900000	And, Satoru Iwata
4900000	4902000	has come out saying, you know, we hope to reveal
4902000	4904000	this game in the not-too-distant
4904000	4906000	future. Quote,
4906000	4908000	It is true that Mr. Anuma's
4908000	4910000	see, I can never say this guy's name. Sorry.
4910000	4912000	Anuma's team has been working on a new
4912000	4914000	Zelda title for Wii U, but the only
4914000	4916000	announcement we have at the time of software that will
4916000	4918000	soon become available is Wind Waker HD.
4918000	4920000	But, they are actually working on an
4920000	4922000	exclusive new Wii U title in the Zelda franchise
4922000	4924000	and I hope in the not-too-distant future
4924000	4926000	we will be able to make the relevant announcement.
4926000	4928000	So, it's like, yes,
4928000	4930000	it's coming, but,
4930000	4932000	no. Yes, it's coming.
4932000	4934000	And, the demo is on the Wind Waker
4934000	4936000	HD disc. That would be
4936000	4938000	awesome, but, probably not happening.
4940000	4942000	But, anyway, what I really wanted to talk
4942000	4944000	about was an interview with
4944000	4946000	Anuma
4946000	4948000	who was talking about
4948000	4950000	the tired formula
4950000	4952000	of traditional Zelda games.
4952000	4954000	I might be kind of
4954000	4956000	embellishing that a little bit, but
4956000	4958000	here it is. Here's the quote in what he said
4958000	4960000	in an interview with LA Times. Quote,
4960000	4962000	It's not that anyone is telling me we have to
4962000	4964000	change the formula. I want to change it.
4964000	4966000	I'm kind of getting tired of it.
4966000	4968000	If I'm getting tired of it, then I'm sure other people are
4968000	4970000	getting tired of it. There's an essential Zelda
4970000	4972000	I feel we need to stay true to. We are
4972000	4974000	still testing things, exploring our options.
4974000	4976000	We haven't landed anywhere at this point. We're still
4976000	4978000	seeing what we can do. What I want to do, not
4978000	4980000	specifically with Link, but with the Zelda franchise,
4980000	4982000	I'm always striving to make something no
4982000	4984000	one else can. Something that is so
4984000	4986000	distinctly Zelda that it can only be done
4986000	4988000	in a Zelda game. There are times when I
4988000	4990000	hit walls and I can't come up with new ideas and I
4990000	4992000	think, maybe I should just give up and quit. But,
4992000	4994000	eventually, a new idea comes along and I'm proud of myself.
4994000	4996000	It breathes new life into the creative
4996000	4998000	process. I go through these phases
4998000	5000000	over and over again. I hope those high points keep
5000000	5002000	on coming. Alright, despite the whole
5002000	5004000	fact that he says he's getting tired of it, I
5004000	5006000	wouldn't read too much into that. I just would think
5006000	5008000	that the next game is going to
5008000	5010000	probably not necessarily
5010000	5012000	be quite like
5012000	5014000	Skyward Sword and Twilight
5014000	5016000	Princess and all that. It might have some
5016000	5018000	differences. But, we've already heard about that.
5018000	5020000	I remember a story about three, four months ago
5020000	5022000	that Skyrim was influencing
5022000	5024000	Zelda as well, a little bit.
5024000	5026000	Maybe something more open world?
5026000	5028000	I would, well, I mean,
5028000	5030000	Zelda kind of already is
5030000	5032000	pretty open world, the more recent ones.
5032000	5034000	But, I mean, maybe a little less,
5034000	5036000	I mean, the dungeons
5036000	5038000	could be fluid, but it isn't even like that
5038000	5040000	in Skyrim. I mean, you go through a
5040000	5042000	transition from open world to...
5042000	5044000	I used to be an adventurer, but I took a hookshot
5044000	5046000	to the knee.
5046000	5048000	Shut up.
5048000	5050000	I think what's going to be neat
5050000	5052000	is that, you know, Nintendo
5052000	5054000	is very passionate about the whole two
5054000	5056000	screen thing. And I'm sure they're
5056000	5058000	going to think of a way to really incorporate
5058000	5060000	the two screen thing into
5060000	5062000	Zelda and do it well. And if I knew
5062000	5064000	what that was, then I
5064000	5066000	would be making the new Zelda game. But
5066000	5068000	I'm pretty sure when we see it, we're going to be like
5068000	5070000	that's pretty awesome. And, you know,
5070000	5072000	how did Zelda work without this before? I think
5072000	5074000	they'll be able to do something with this.
5074000	5076000	Slidekick
5076000	5078000	is in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
5078000	5080000	and says, that's great news. I love
5080000	5082000	Zelda, but Skyward Sword was a step forward
5082000	5084000	in the right direction and they need to continue to
5084000	5086000	experiment with it. So,
5086000	5088000	there you go.
5088000	5090000	Hopefully we'll get more info on this soon.
5090000	5092000	But in the meantime,
5092000	5094000	let's go back to a more classic
5094000	5096000	era of video games.
5096000	5098000	I was really short. Let's go
5098000	5100000	to when Zelda 2 was
5100000	5102000	completely breaking the formula and some
5102000	5104000	people hated it for that. No, no, no. Let's go
5104000	5106000	earlier than that. Let's go even earlier
5106000	5108000	than that. Let's go to me being
5108000	5110000	six years old. Oh my God.
5110000	5112000	Is this a game
5112000	5114000	that was long like...
5114000	5116000	I had to stand on a step stool
5116000	5118000	to play it. Was it
5118000	5120000	Pong? No. Not that
5120000	5122000	old. Was it Space War? No.
5122000	5124000	Girl, please. Alright.
5124000	5126000	It's the classic game of the week. Dark Soccer's gonna
5126000	5128000	jump into her gaming vault and pull a game
5128000	5130000	out of her butt that she
5130000	5132000	framed. Ah! No.
5132000	5134000	It's Kangaroo.
5134000	5136000	I'm gonna jump right into it.
5136000	5138000	It was done by Sun Electronics
5138000	5140000	distributed
5140000	5142000	by Atari.
5142000	5144000	It's sort of
5144000	5146000	like a cross between Donkey Kong and Popeye.
5146000	5148000	You basically play a mother
5148000	5150000	kangaroo who has to rescue her baby,
5150000	5152000	her little joey. You go through the
5152000	5154000	tree tops and
5154000	5156000	beat up monkeys. I was not aware
5156000	5158000	that there were monkeys in Australia. Are there monkeys
5158000	5160000	in Australia? There's kangaroos in Australia.
5160000	5162000	But why are there monkeys?
5162000	5164000	They just run
5164000	5166000	the other direction. Okay.
5166000	5168000	My thought is that
5168000	5170000	they're really criminals because you know
5170000	5172000	that's how Australia was started. Yes.
5172000	5174000	I know the Australians love it when you point that out.
5174000	5176000	I think that
5176000	5178000	they're pink criminals.
5178000	5180000	So I'm gonna go with that. That's my head cannon.
5180000	5182000	You cannot convince me otherwise.
5182000	5184000	So you can punch apples and
5184000	5186000	throw them at
5186000	5188000	they
5188000	5190000	throw apples at you and you can punch them and
5190000	5192000	you
5192000	5194000	can knock down the monkeys with it. So
5194000	5196000	basically you go up ladders
5196000	5198000	through trees to rescue your baby kangaroo.
5198000	5200000	There are four different
5200000	5202000	levels and basically like I said
5202000	5204000	you rescue the joey
5204000	5206000	and you get apples thrown at you
5206000	5208000	and you get to beat up the mean monkeys.
5208000	5210000	You can punch them with your boxing gloves
5210000	5212000	and you can punch the apples
5212000	5214000	and you can punch other fruit. You just go around
5214000	5216000	punching shit. And then
5216000	5218000	you have to watch out for the big
5218000	5220000	ape who tries to take your gloves
5220000	5222000	away. You can't punch him if you don't have boxing
5222000	5224000	gloves. But I would just think
5224000	5226000	that a kangaroo could kick him in the face.
5226000	5228000	Cause I imagine that being kicked by a kangaroo
5228000	5230000	would really freaking hurt.
5230000	5232000	So
5232000	5234000	it's uh, the third level
5234000	5236000	is the different one cause the baby kangaroo
5236000	5238000	is um
5238000	5240000	actually being held up by monkeys
5240000	5242000	and you get apples
5242000	5244000	that uh
5244000	5246000	basically uh get sent up on
5246000	5248000	you for when you climb up there so you have to punch
5248000	5250000	the monkeys several times until the cage
5250000	5252000	is open. Punch the monkey.
5252000	5254000	At least I didn't say punch the monkey.
5254000	5256000	Never mind, that's rude.
5256000	5258000	So the music
5258000	5260000	in the background is uh like
5260000	5262000	old classical folk tunes. You have
5262000	5264000	the American Patrol
5264000	5266000	by F.W. Meachum
5266000	5268000	and Oh Susanna
5268000	5270000	and you have
5270000	5272000	Westminster Quarters where the bell
5272000	5274000	plays to and
5274000	5276000	Marcia Alla Turca which was
5276000	5278000	well
5278000	5280000	music inspired by that
5280000	5282000	by Beethoven so
5282000	5284000	anyway it came out on the
5284000	5286000	Atari 2600 and the 5200
5286000	5288000	which I have both copies of. The 5200
5288000	5290000	version is super good.
5290000	5292000	Never play it with a trackball by the way
5292000	5294000	because you will want to shoot yourself in the face.
5294000	5296000	Now
5296000	5298000	kangaroo
5298000	5300000	was actually involved
5300000	5302000	with the Saturday Supercade. You remember that Rob?
5302000	5304000	I actually do. 1984.
5304000	5306000	Kangaroo and Space Ace
5306000	5308000	replaced Pitfall Harry, Frogger and Donkey Kong
5308000	5310000	Jr. for segments on that show.
5310000	5312000	And so basically the kangaroos
5312000	5314000	were Katie and Joey
5314000	5316000	and they lived in a
5316000	5318000	zoo run by Mr. Friendly
5318000	5320000	and they were friends
5320000	5322000	with Sid the Squirrel
5322000	5324000	and they had to fight the
5324000	5326000	Monkey Biz Gang.
5326000	5328000	Which you know who won? Oh that's actually cool.
5328000	5330000	I didn't know that. One of the voices for one of the monkeys
5330000	5332000	was Frank Welker. They were Bingo
5332000	5334000	Bango Bongo and Fred.
5334000	5336000	You can actually get those on DVD.
5336000	5338000	That's kind of cool. I need to go get those on DVD.
5338000	5340000	So yeah. Kangaroo.
5340000	5342000	Fun game.
5342000	5344000	Now here's my
5344000	5346000	background story on this one.
5346000	5348000	Imagine 1982.
5348000	5350000	Six years old.
5350000	5352000	I'm in first grade.
5352000	5354000	At Godfather's Pizza.
5356000	5358000	Kneeling on
5358000	5360000	this weird stool trying
5360000	5362000	to play freaking kangaroo.
5362000	5364000	And I kept running
5364000	5366000	back for quarters because I was bound
5366000	5368000	and determined to punch those damn monkeys.
5368000	5370000	And I punch the monkeys.
5372000	5374000	Tell us more about how you punch the monkeys.
5374000	5376000	I punch monkeys all the time.
5376000	5378000	That's what they get for
5378000	5380000	throwing poo and yanking it
5380000	5382000	in the zoo. Monkeys are
5382000	5384000	nasty little bastards.
5384000	5386000	I love
5386000	5388000	monkeys. I love lemurs.
5388000	5390000	If someone
5390000	5392000	said, do you want a monkey or a lemur?
5392000	5394000	I pick a lemur every time.
5394000	5396000	Or a kangaroo.
5396000	5398000	I don't know what the hell that has to do with the game
5398000	5400000	but that's so funny. Monkeys!
5400000	5402000	Punching monkeys. There it is.
5402000	5404000	The Punching Monkey classic.
5404000	5406000	Kangaroo.
5406000	5408000	Available in arcades everywhere.
5408000	5410000	Punching monkeys.
5410000	5412000	Look for it where you can punch your favorite monkeys. Tigerclaw posted
5412000	5414000	up the intro to the kangaroo cartoon.
5414000	5416000	There you go.
5416000	5418000	But you know what? Nothing is as awesome as punching a monkey.
5418000	5420000	I stand by
5420000	5422000	my monkey punching. There's your classic
5422000	5424000	game of the week. At least I didn't say
5424000	5426000	donkey. I was waiting the whole
5426000	5428000	time for you to make a donkey punch punch.
5428000	5430000	Anyhow. I wasn't going to say it
5430000	5432000	but I did anyway. Let's take a break
5432000	5434000	and Dark Soccer
5434000	5436000	has got to go punch a monkey or two. When we come back
5436000	5438000	with more of Orange Lawn's radio. Do you have
5438000	5440000	monkeys? Lots of responses to the
5440000	5442000	question of the week. No, just a cat and you can't
5442000	5444000	punch her. She doesn't like that. I will punch
5444000	5446000	her by petting her. And
5446000	5448000	the mail bag, maybe. I don't know. There were no
5448000	5450000	emails in there this morning when I looked.
5450000	5452000	And your phone calls
5452000	5454000	when we come back with more of Orange Lawn's
5454000	5456000	radio right after this break.
5456000	5458000	Stay tuned.
5478000	5480000	Congratulations.
5480000	5482000	Congratulations.
5484000	5486000	Is my mic off? Hi.
5486000	5488000	Thanks to our
5488000	5490000	friends at gamefood.org for that
5490000	5492000	bumper. Appreciate it.
5492000	5494000	Sometimes I wish we
5494000	5496000	did a tape show like they did so that way
5496000	5498000	I could cover up all those screw ups when they
5498000	5500000	happen like I don't have my mic on.
5500000	5502000	That's the second
5502000	5504000	time you've heard that bumper. That's because
5504000	5506000	we're not getting
5506000	5508000	any more bumpers from our listeners.
5508000	5510000	Shame on all of you. So you should
5510000	5512000	definitely send us some. Check the
5512000	5514000	forums over at vognetwork.com
5514000	5516000	and you can send us a bumper. And
5516000	5518000	you can tell us whatever you want. Use your voice
5518000	5520000	here on the program to tell
5520000	5522000	us whatever. We have a lot of people
5522000	5524000	giving their voices to the FUGL
5524000	5526000	question of the week here in a little bit. But we'll
5526000	5528000	play that. We'll get to that in a
5528000	5530000	little bit here. But first we have some
5530000	5532000	rapid fire news we've got to go over.
5532000	5534000	Loki.
5534000	5536000	Alright. Let's talk
5536000	5538000	a little bit about
5538000	5540000	the awesome game that is Saints
5540000	5542000	Row 4.
5542000	5544000	And there was some wonderful
5544000	5546000	news that came out from a panel at
5546000	5548000	Comic-Con
5548000	5550000	actually. And they were talking a little bit
5550000	5552000	about some of the scrapped ideas that they had.
5552000	5554000	Originally the end of the game was
5554000	5556000	going to have a Bollywood dance number.
5556000	5558000	Which...
5558000	5560000	that's awesome. Outstanding. Outstanding.
5560000	5562000	The only problem was
5562000	5564000	it wasn't possible for them to
5564000	5566000	do that because of the cost.
5566000	5568000	By the time they figured out which
5568000	5570000	Bollywood
5570000	5572000	song to license
5572000	5574000	and also
5574000	5576000	doing all the choreography and stuff like that
5576000	5578000	and the motion capture. It was just going to be too
5578000	5580000	much. So they just couldn't
5580000	5582000	end up doing that.
5582000	5584000	Although I'm sure the ending
5584000	5586000	of the game is going to be awesome.
5586000	5588000	Apparently though they said that there's some really interesting
5588000	5590000	details in the game. They're kind of calling it
5590000	5592000	they're joking that
5592000	5594000	Saints Row is about the arts.
5594000	5596000	And I guess they have one of the in-game
5596000	5598000	radio stations where the
5598000	5600000	evil alien guy
5600000	5602000	Zinyak. He's
5602000	5604000	actually reading a bunch of different classical
5604000	5606000	literature including
5606000	5608000	monologues from Shakespeare and
5608000	5610000	even the entire first chapter of Jane
5610000	5612000	Austin's Pride and Prejudice.
5612000	5614000	Spoiler alert!
5614000	5616000	I will not be listening to that station.
5616000	5618000	I've been listening to the dubstep dance
5618000	5620000	as I
5620000	5622000	always do.
5622000	5624000	And probably flipping
5624000	5626000	between that and the 80's station because I hear the 80's
5626000	5628000	station is pretty awesome. Will you listen to your dubstep
5628000	5630000	while you use your dubstep gun?
5630000	5632000	No!
5632000	5634000	Assuming that I can fire
5634000	5636000	that out the window, yes.
5636000	5638000	Most likely, no.
5638000	5640000	I can't leave this.
5640000	5642000	I can't wait.
5642000	5644000	It's not much longer now, right?
5644000	5646000	We're getting to that point of the year. It's getting closer.
5646000	5648000	What is today?
5648000	5650000	July 21st.
5650000	5652000	We're like five weeks away
5652000	5654000	from Final Fantasy 14
5654000	5656000	Realm Reborn.
5656000	5658000	That's going to be a tight schedule.
5658000	5660000	Alright.
5660000	5662000	So I guess here's a positive.
5662000	5664000	Xbox One is also going to support partial
5664000	5666000	download support.
5666000	5668000	Or I should say partial download play.
5668000	5670000	Meaning that while a game is being downloaded
5670000	5672000	you will be able to play
5672000	5674000	the game thanks to the cloud.
5676000	5678000	Cool. When the cloud works.
5678000	5680000	When the cloud works.
5680000	5682000	Final Fantasy 7 is an indication, though granted
5682000	5684000	the servers are not even
5684000	5686000	run by the same company.
5686000	5688000	Perhaps you have to level up
5688000	5690000	cloud so that he has his limit break.
5690000	5692000	Limit break is cloud saving.
5692000	5694000	No, you get the limit break at level one.
5694000	5696000	You get to use limit breaks in the beginning of the game.
5696000	5698000	Where have you been?
5698000	5700000	Alright.
5700000	5702000	Uh oh. Troll comment in our chat room.
5702000	5704000	Not really, but live.vognetwork.com
5704000	5706000	I'm going to read it anyway.
5706000	5708000	MaskedBishop in our chat room says
5708000	5710000	I'm still trying to figure out the selling point
5710000	5712000	of the Saints Row series. Loki?
5712000	5714000	It depends which one you're talking about.
5714000	5716000	The original Saints Row games were kind of like a
5716000	5718000	Grand Theft Auto. In fact
5718000	5720000	Saints Row 1 for me was
5720000	5722000	Hey, Grand Theft Auto is on the Xbox 360
5722000	5724000	I'm going to play this game. And it was fun.
5724000	5726000	I think kind of the last few
5726000	5728000	games it's just been so over the top
5728000	5730000	and ridiculous that it's entertaining.
5730000	5732000	And Bobby is informing me yes
5732000	5734000	You can listen to the radio anytime because it's cyberspace
5734000	5736000	and the radio stations are injected directly into your brain.
5736000	5738000	Awesome. So yes, you can listen to the dubstep
5738000	5740000	while firing the dubstep gun.
5740000	5742000	Hooray.
5742000	5744000	Well let me say this. In my experience
5744000	5746000	with at least Saints Row 3
5746000	5748000	Saints Row is good
5748000	5750000	for the same reason that This is the End
5750000	5752000	was good. It's fucking ridiculous
5752000	5754000	and dumb as hell, but you can't help
5754000	5756000	but laugh. Like it's just over the top
5756000	5758000	stupid. It's beyond over the top.
5758000	5760000	Yeah. And some of the things in that movie
5760000	5762000	were just ridiculous
5762000	5764000	but I laughed. Like it was so funny.
5764000	5766000	It's not. See Grand Theft Auto
5766000	5768000	is trying to take itself like kind of
5768000	5770000	like an Oscar movie I guess where it's
5770000	5772000	very well done. Grand Theft Auto is a little
5772000	5774000	ridiculous in itself. It is a little ridiculous.
5774000	5776000	Some of the things you can do. But they're definitely going
5776000	5778000	along the lines of realism. Like the amount of
5778000	5780000	detail that they have in the game with the whole
5780000	5782000	like stock markets and
5782000	5784000	you know just all the stuff you can do in the game
5784000	5786000	it's you know they're going
5786000	5788000	one way with Grand Theft Auto. Whereas Saints
5788000	5790000	Row is like kind of going the completely opposite
5790000	5792000	direction. They're just like hey you know
5792000	5794000	be fun as if we have super powers. Are we going to explain
5794000	5796000	it. Whatever. He's in the matrix now
5796000	5798000	OK. They're done. OK. Sweet
5798000	5800000	You know hey we're going to have a gun that fires
5800000	5802000	dubstep.
5802000	5804000	Whatever. It's just ridiculous. It's supposed to be
5804000	5806000	ridiculous.
5806000	5808000	And that's the whole point. I mean if that's the type
5808000	5810000	of game you want to play then play Saints Row.
5810000	5812000	I honestly think it should play both because
5812000	5814000	they're both awesome. I will be playing
5814000	5816000	both. A lot.
5816000	5818000	So much so that I'm probably not going to get
5818000	5820000	PlayStation 4 now. Maybe.
5820000	5822000	BlackWolf and TimTrip
5822000	5824000	are having a conversation in our chat room about it
5824000	5826000	and BlackWolf says Tim
5826000	5828000	Saints Row 4 is basically Grand Theft Auto meets
5828000	5830000	Crackdown meets Over the Top Humor especially
5830000	5832000	with their version of the Crackdown orbs.
5832000	5834000	Oh. Alan's here to give
5834000	5836000	comment. Hi Alan. Hello.
5836000	5838000	Just want to say because I beat
5838000	5840000	Grand Theft Auto 4 all the way through just a couple weeks
5840000	5842000	ago after the insanity of GTA
5842000	5844000	3 San Andreas which there was a lot
5844000	5846000	of crazy stuff in that. A lot of people thought
5846000	5848000	that 4 proper with
5848000	5850000	Niko Bellic was too dry. Oh yeah. It's very
5850000	5852000	bleak and just super serious. Well did you
5852000	5854000	get to, did you play through the Valet of
5854000	5856000	Gay Tony? No. I'm only like an hour into
5856000	5858000	Lost and Damned.
5858000	5860000	Ok. When you get to Valet of Gay Tony it's kind of like they're trying
5860000	5862000	to bring it back towards San Andreas.
5862000	5864000	And I think honestly that was
5864000	5866000	like the best as far as like playing with the weapon
5866000	5868000	set and stuff like that. It was the best. And then
5868000	5870000	I guess you can tell already from the gameplay trailer
5870000	5872000	for 5 that they realized that they
5872000	5874000	don't want to turn the dial up to Saints
5874000	5876000	Row crazy but they need to have
5876000	5878000	more over the top
5878000	5880000	stuff in it I think.
5880000	5882000	They're just giving you more freedom without
5882000	5884000	going crazy with the stuff that's in there.
5884000	5886000	In San Andreas wasn't there like a big wheel? Like it
5886000	5888000	wasn't mod you could just drive a big wheel around?
5888000	5890000	I don't
5890000	5892000	remember. It's been a while. You could like parachute
5892000	5894000	off buildings. A lot of crazy stuff and then 4
5894000	5896000	was very
5896000	5898000	very bleak.
5898000	5900000	Captain Spike in our
5900000	5902000	chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says
5902000	5904000	I want games to be fun. Games and
5904000	5906000	all. Not really here for Grand Theft Auto's 4
5906000	5908000	story wants to be an Oscar winning movie
5908000	5910000	bullshit or whatever. It was fun. You just don't
5910000	5912000	play the main storyline. Who cares?
5912000	5914000	Once in a while I'm ok
5914000	5916000	with Oscar worthy video games
5916000	5918000	though. Like you know Journey is like a Night of the Met.
5918000	5920000	Seriously Saints Row the 3rd is fun. It's pretty
5920000	5922000	fun. There's a little bit
5922000	5924000	of repetition when it comes to some of the activities
5924000	5926000	and stuff but I think Saints Row
5926000	5928000	the 3rd was fun and Saints Row 2 was actually
5928000	5930000	pretty fun so Saints Row 4 sounds like
5930000	5932000	it's going to be a lot of fun too. Alright let's move on.
5932000	5934000	We got to rail a little bit. Did you just say your thing?
5934000	5936000	No no I haven't done that yet. Last
5936000	5938000	but not least they're trying
5938000	5940000	to bring back
5940000	5942000	sort of a spiritual successor
5942000	5944000	to Police Quest.
5944000	5946000	It's actually being done by the same creator
5946000	5948000	Robert
5948000	5950000	Lindsley
5950000	5952000	I guess and he
5952000	5954000	is trying to kick start a game called
5954000	5956000	Precinct and right now their funding
5956000	5958000	goal is half a million dollars
5958000	5960000	and
5960000	5962000	so yeah
5962000	5964000	apparently I mean the game is going to be very similar
5964000	5966000	to I guess
5966000	5968000	the Police Quest series and
5968000	5970000	if you're looking to get a game similar
5970000	5972000	to that then maybe you should try
5972000	5974000	backing this. Right now as of recording
5974000	5976000	they are up to $50,000
5976000	5978000	actually close to $51,000
5978000	5980000	still a ways away from their goal but they have 25
5980000	5982000	days left so there is a
5982000	5984000	chance and some of the concept
5984000	5986000	art looks actually pretty sweet. It's all
5986000	5988000	like first person you have like the patrol view
5988000	5990000	and stuff like that so
5990000	5992000	looks like it could be pretty cool.
5992000	5994000	Okay.
5994000	5996000	And I like their precinct funding
5996000	5998000	chart here. They said our campaign
5998000	6000000	they're you know $500,000
6000000	6002000	awesome $600,000
6002000	6004000	awesomer $700,000
6004000	6006000	mega awesome
6006000	6008000	$800,000 plus badonk.
6008000	6010000	Alright
6010000	6012000	well hopefully this movie will be pretty
6012000	6014000	badonk but the first signs of
6014000	6016000	the World of Warcraft movie
6016000	6018000	was shown at Comic Con. The teaser
6018000	6020000	trailer unveiled at Comic Con
6020000	6022000	but here's the thing the movie doesn't have any
6022000	6024000	stars attached yet so there wasn't really a
6024000	6026000	lot to show but the teaser did
6026000	6028000	have a mix of live action and computer
6028000	6030000	generated effects.
6030000	6032000	It was out in a desert field and had an armored
6032000	6034000	human warrior that drank a potion and
6034000	6036000	drew a sword just before battling
6036000	6038000	a hammer wielding orc.
6038000	6040000	Of course as we all know Duncan Jones
6040000	6042000	who did Source Code and Moon and
6042000	6044000	also importantly as David Bowie's son
6044000	6046000	is helming the Warcraft
6046000	6048000	film. It's supposed to begin
6048000	6050000	shooting in early 2014. I'm assuming
6050000	6052000	that means released in probably
6052000	6054000	2015. Can Bowie
6054000	6056000	get like a monarch
6056000	6058000	you know position in the movie? I would love
6058000	6060000	that. I would love that. Perhaps the
6060000	6062000	king of the goblins? I think
6062000	6064000	I think the reason why he
6064000	6066000	goes by the name Duncan Jones is he doesn't
6066000	6068000	want to be in the shadow of his dad though so
6068000	6070000	I would I would really really
6070000	6072000	be surprised if David Bowie turns up in this
6072000	6074000	at all. And maybe he can
6074000	6076000	you know do a little dance magic
6076000	6078000	dance. Now by the
6078000	6080000	way this clip is not on the internet
6080000	6082000	for us to see. I don't know if it leaked
6082000	6084000	out to YouTube. I'm sure it's out there somewhere
6084000	6086000	but Blizzard has said there is no plans
6086000	6088000	to release the mood piece that
6088000	6090000	was shown at Comic Con. That was only for
6090000	6092000	Comic Con and not for public
6092000	6094000	consumption which I'm actually okay with
6094000	6096000	because again it's not
6096000	6098000	real footage from the movie so to speak
6098000	6100000	because there's no stars attached yet or anything
6100000	6102000	so interesting though that it's a human
6102000	6104000	versus an orc
6104000	6106000	the movie is also just called Warcraft
6106000	6108000	it's not called World of Warcraft
6108000	6110000	so I'm wondering if they're taking it way back
6110000	6112000	like they might be taking the story way back
6112000	6114000	to like the original humans versus orc story which
6114000	6116000	is alright. As it should be.
6116000	6118000	Yeah I think I think fans would be
6118000	6120000	forgiving if that's where they want to go with it
6120000	6122000	so. It used to all be about Sylvanas
6122000	6124000	and all that.
6124000	6126000	Moving on to some other quick news
6126000	6128000	here.
6128000	6130000	Oh yes some voices
6130000	6132000	being crowd sourced here
6132000	6134000	for Oddworld
6134000	6136000	Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty
6136000	6138000	If you would like
6138000	6140000	to have your voice featured in the game
6140000	6142000	as a Madonkin
6142000	6144000	you can be in the remake
6144000	6146000	there. You just have to record in a
6146000	6148000	microphone there a few phrases
6148000	6150000	and you make a Soundcloud account. Make sure things
6150000	6152000	sound fine. Don't have a lot of feedback
6152000	6154000	in the background or whatever. It's over on
6154000	6156000	the official blog Oddworld.com
6156000	6158000	and you have to get those in by
6158000	6160000	Friday July 26th.
6160000	6162000	But you could have your voice featured in the game. I wonder if I should
6162000	6164000	send something in. I think that might be fun.
6164000	6166000	I could use the recording equipment here.
6166000	6168000	You have to say such things as
6168000	6170000	I'm pulling up the blog here. Some of the
6170000	6172000	like
6172000	6174000	it was very simple stuff. Some of it was like
6174000	6176000	ow. Ogg.
6176000	6178000	You know things like that.
6178000	6180000	Yeah. Which of course now it's not coming up
6180000	6182000	but anyhow.
6182000	6184000	Let me try one more time.
6184000	6186000	This link here might show it.
6186000	6188000	Live radio
6188000	6190000	of course. There we go.
6190000	6192000	The words to say are
6192000	6194000	hello, okay, laughing
6194000	6196000	giggling, angry hissing,
6196000	6198000	pain grunts, death screams
6198000	6200000	and bonus points for providing some sound
6200000	6202000	effects for the wildlife of Mudos.
6202000	6204000	Birds, scarabs, elumes, etc.
6204000	6206000	Just
6206000	6208000	get on the microphone. I'm a bird.
6208000	6210000	Make strange noises
6210000	6212000	because somebody is going to have to listen to it.
6214000	6216000	Is your mic not on Dark Sakura?
6216000	6218000	The chat room is bitching.
6218000	6220000	Oh you were muted.
6220000	6222000	Damn it Rob!
6222000	6224000	That's awesome.
6224000	6226000	That was totally my bad. Sorry Dark Sakura.
6226000	6228000	That was not awesome. That was lame.
6228000	6230000	Boy we're all sorts of broken here at OLR tonight.
6230000	6232000	Sorry about that.
6232000	6234000	Anyhow, Dark Sakura
6234000	6236000	I have a new story to make it all better.
6236000	6238000	Alright, so here's the deal.
6238000	6240000	Capcom working on what
6240000	6242000	they're calling a major IP for the Nintendo 3DS
6242000	6244000	it's called Geist Crusher.
6244000	6246000	It's a multiplayer game where you're going to
6246000	6248000	fight monsters known as Geists
6248000	6250000	or G-A-I-S-T-S. Geists.
6250000	6252000	Here's the thing though, Geist Crusher
6252000	6254000	co-developed by Treasure.
6254000	6256000	So there you go. The announcement's
6256000	6258000	on Treasure's website, treasure-inc.co.jp
6258000	6260000	so
6260000	6262000	Capcom and Treasure are coming
6262000	6264000	together for this.
6264000	6266000	So did that make it a little better?
6266000	6268000	I might be a little tingly.
6268000	6270000	Alright, then why don't you do some news
6270000	6272000	with your now newly on mic.
6272000	6274000	Yeah.
6274000	6276000	Thanks Rob.
6276000	6278000	Well in other news
6278000	6280000	it's actually not pulling up.
6280000	6282000	Great. Oh yeah, Valve
6282000	6284000	while they will not give us
6284000	6286000	a Half-Life 3 yet
6286000	6288000	they are
6288000	6290000	Because they don't love you.
6290000	6292000	Oh, they don't love somebody.
6292000	6294000	So
6294000	6296000	they are actually
6296000	6298000	working with
6298000	6300000	the
6300000	6302000	modding community.
6302000	6304000	So they're
6304000	6306000	basically
6308000	6310000	Come on thing. I'm sorry
6310000	6312000	it's my iPad being stupid.
6312000	6314000	So basically
6314000	6316000	they are doing the Half-Life
6316000	6318000	campaign as a co-op
6318000	6320000	and it's going to be put on
6320000	6322000	for free and it's going to be
6322000	6324000	available through Steam.
6324000	6326000	So that is at least
6326000	6328000	something new, right?
6328000	6330000	And it's the Sven co-op
6330000	6332000	as a standalone game.
6332000	6334000	In other news
6334000	6336000	this makes me super happy
6336000	6338000	there's an Adventure Time game
6338000	6340000	It's actually
6340000	6342000	going to be out
6342000	6344000	in the fall
6344000	6346000	on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and 3DS
6346000	6348000	and it's called Adventure Time
6348000	6350000	Explore the dungeon because I don't know.
6350000	6352000	So
6352000	6354000	I'm super, super, super
6354000	6356000	excited. I like Adventure Time.
6356000	6358000	And last
6358000	6360000	but not least
6360000	6362000	this actually makes me super happy
6362000	6364000	Lego Marvel Super Heroes
6364000	6366000	has new characters to add to it
6366000	6368000	including
6368000	6370000	Stan Lee
6370000	6372000	Howard the Duck
6372000	6374000	and Squirrel Girl. I love Squirrel Girl
6374000	6376000	because she kicked the crap out of Thanos
6376000	6378000	and Doctor Doom and did it legit
6378000	6380000	through the power of squirrels.
6380000	6382000	So yeah, also included
6382000	6384000	there's Doctor Doom, Jean Grey
6384000	6386000	What exactly is the power of squirrels?
6386000	6388000	She talks to squirrels. Her power is control of squirrels.
6388000	6390000	And she can speak squirrel language
6390000	6392000	and she also has sharp teeth and little claws
6392000	6394000	and a big bushy tail and she can climb
6394000	6396000	up trees.
6396000	6398000	She also can kick anybody's ass.
6398000	6400000	Apparently Squirrel Girl cannot be defeated by anybody.
6400000	6402000	And she's also Jessica Jones' nanny.
6402000	6404000	So that makes her super cool.
6404000	6406000	But yeah, also
6406000	6408000	confirmed is Doctor Doom,
6408000	6410000	Jean Grey, Elektra, Magneto,
6410000	6412000	Silver Samurai, The Punisher, Beast,
6412000	6414000	Gambit Storm, Green Goblin,
6414000	6416000	Juggernaut, Rhino, The Thing, Vulture,
6416000	6418000	Sabretooth, and Invisible Woman.
6418000	6420000	So we also
6420000	6422000	will have
6422000	6424000	Coulson in the game.
6424000	6426000	And you have a pre-order exclusive
6426000	6428000	The Iron Patriot and Deadpool.
6428000	6430000	So there you go.
6430000	6432000	There you go.
6432000	6434000	Alright, let's go to the foogle question
6434000	6436000	of the week. Which, oh my gosh,
6436000	6438000	this is one of the most popular ones we've ever asked.
6438000	6440000	There's so many answers this week. I don't know what to do.
6440000	6442000	Alright, let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6448000	6450000	You take Facebook
6450000	6452000	and Google, you slam them together, you get
6452000	6454000	foogle. And we ask a question of our
6454000	6456000	Facebook and Google Plus communities
6456000	6458000	every week here on the show. And it's
6458000	6460000	foogle. And I
6460000	6462000	knew the news about
6462000	6464000	Strider was going to make Dark
6464000	6466000	Sakura very happy. And Dan, we talked
6466000	6468000	about that in part A. I feel all squishy now.
6468000	6470000	So I wanted to ask a similar question of the
6470000	6472000	listeners tonight with the foogle question of the week. And that is
6472000	6474000	what long dormant series would you
6474000	6476000	like to see make a comeback? And I said
6476000	6478000	listeners, you only get to pick one to try and
6478000	6480000	keep the answers a little bit short tonight.
6480000	6482000	There are alone
6482000	6484000	like 23 answers on Facebook.
6484000	6486000	Should I read them all? That's a lot. Do eat.
6486000	6488000	I'm going to read them all quickly.
6488000	6490000	I'm only going to read
6490000	6492000	like little bits and pieces. If I don't read the entire
6492000	6494000	answer, I'm sorry. You'll just have to go
6494000	6496000	read them for yourself. Facebook.com
6496000	6498000	or Google Plus community.
6498000	6500000	Guess what? What? You're not really sorry.
6500000	6502000	Alright. VX JasonXV says
6502000	6504000	bust a groove. But
6504000	6506000	this also means it will probably end up a
6506000	6508000	connect, move, or wiimote dancing game.
6508000	6510000	Bust a move. Move.
6510000	6512000	Well, it depends what country.
6512000	6514000	Unfolded Raptor says
6514000	6516000	new Gex game. Even if it's not
6516000	6518000	Gex 4, just a really nice reboot.
6518000	6520000	Rob
6520000	6522000	himself says a remake of California
6522000	6524000	games because he played that to death
6524000	6526000	on the Sega Master System along with Strider.
6526000	6528000	James
6528000	6530000	S says I want a new entry to the Soul
6530000	6532000	Blazer saga, but I'd settle for a remastered
6532000	6534000	Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia
6534000	6536000	Terra Enigma trilogy for my 3DS.
6536000	6538000	That is a fucking great answer.
6538000	6540000	I'll have you know. I would love
6540000	6542000	that too. Jeremy J,
6542000	6544000	our buddy from Koopa Club says Mega Man.
6544000	6546000	See, here's the thing with
6546000	6548000	Mega Man though is that although Capcom
6548000	6550000	has been really, they've just
6550000	6552000	been dicks about it to an extent.
6552000	6554000	Like, at least
6554000	6556000	there was Mega Man 9 and 10
6556000	6558000	and those weren't that long
6558000	6560000	ago all things considered. And
6560000	6562000	the Mega Man and Smash Brothers thing, now
6562000	6564000	I admit, I as much as the next person would
6564000	6566000	like to see a new 3D Mega Man Legends
6566000	6568000	or just like in a Mega Man 11
6568000	6570000	in the 2-bit style or you know
6570000	6572000	kind of like a 2.5D kind of
6572000	6574000	Mega Man game I think would be awesome, especially maybe
6574000	6576000	on like the Wii U or something, but
6576000	6578000	I don't know. Mega Man's not
6578000	6580000	as
6580000	6582000	it hasn't been as horribly long
6582000	6584000	for Mega Man yet as some other games
6584000	6586000	I can think of like on the Nintendo and so forth
6586000	6588000	but. Like I don't know
6588000	6590000	the Guardian Legend. Yeah
6590000	6592000	right. Seriously? I don't think anybody
6592000	6594000	answered Guardian Legend to which I
6594000	6596000	say all fail. All these people are wrong. Yeah
6596000	6598000	so it's unfortunate that all of our listeners had to be wrong
6598000	6600000	tonight. Alright
6600000	6602000	Gaming Nerd said a new
6602000	6604000	Alex Kidd game. He's been featured
6604000	6606000	in Sega collections but never a new game
6606000	6608000	or a remake of his own. It would be nice to
6608000	6610000	see Alex Kidd come back wouldn't it?
6610000	6612000	DJ Rama S says
6612000	6614000	one of the most underrated and underappreciated fighting
6614000	6616000	games, Rival Schools.
6616000	6618000	Yeah I love Rival Schools. Zether
6618000	6620000	says Gradius. Konami's kept it locked
6620000	6622000	up for far too long. But didn't we
6622000	6624000	have Gradius 5 just a few years ago?
6624000	6626000	Was it really that, not that long ago?
6626000	6628000	I don't think it was that long ago.
6628000	6630000	William Murderface says
6630000	6632000	a sequel to Darkwatch. It would be
6632000	6634000	Halo but with vampire cowboys.
6634000	6636000	That'd be cool.
6636000	6638000	Fifth Dream says I was talking about Section Z
6638000	6640000	and would love to see it make a comeback.
6640000	6642000	Kareem J says
6642000	6644000	Streets of Rage 4. Thanks.
6644000	6646000	Loco Poco
6646000	6648000	says I'd love to see an Ill Bleed
6648000	6650000	sequel. It was a great mixture of horror and
6650000	6652000	camp.
6652000	6654000	Nikki E says Streets of Rage.
6654000	6656000	I still keep coming back to that game series.
6656000	6658000	Code Man says Mega Man Legends.
6658000	6660000	Rich B says
6660000	6662000	not really a series but I've always wanted to see
6662000	6664000	a follow up to Midnight Resistance on the
6664000	6666000	Sega Genesis. Midnight Resistance is a good game.
6666000	6668000	Yeah, I'll be. Especially
6668000	6670000	something kind of like really off the radar
6670000	6672000	like that. I think I've done it for Classic.
6672000	6674000	You probably have at some point.
6674000	6676000	But still I mean
6676000	6678000	like he said in the answer
6678000	6680000	there was never a series there, just one
6680000	6682000	really good game that we want to see something
6682000	6684000	else with.
6684000	6686000	Raginator says Samurai Showdown series
6686000	6688000	provided that an update stays true to the
6688000	6690000	original five games, 2D and Pixels.
6690000	6692000	They actually said that they were completely
6692000	6694000	closing the series off after five so I don't think that's happening.
6694000	6696000	Bastards. We'll open it back
6696000	6698000	up.
6698000	6700000	Let's see. Edgar R says
6700000	6702000	a new duck hunt.
6702000	6704000	This time the dog dies.
6704000	6706000	Gamer Girl says
6706000	6708000	even though this isn't a series I'd love to see Kid Chameleon.
6708000	6710000	I love that game. It's a good pick.
6710000	6712000	Chiggers says Altered Beast.
6712000	6714000	Yeah, make it
6714000	6716000	better this time too.
6716000	6718000	KNIM says Secret of Evermore.
6718000	6720000	I'd be happy if they released it again on anything
6720000	6722000	but Square doesn't want my money evidently.
6722000	6724000	Yeah, Secret of Evermore kind of gets
6724000	6726000	crapped on because it was the Square
6726000	6728000	USA title and it wasn't really part of the
6728000	6730000	second Detsetsu series. It was like a spinoff but
6730000	6732000	Secret of Evermore had some neat stuff about it.
6732000	6734000	Did you know that that was one of the first soundtracks
6734000	6736000	that, what's his name, Jeremy Sulay
6736000	6738000	that guy that does the soundtracks for Elder Scrolls
6738000	6740000	and stuff? He did the soundtrack for Secret of Evermore.
6740000	6742000	It was one of his first games ever. He was probably like 19
6742000	6744000	when he did it. How's that game?
6744000	6746000	I think Secret of Evermore
6746000	6748000	was really shit on when it first came
6748000	6750000	out but like I think Time
6750000	6752000	has treated it well and the whole like
6752000	6754000	you know it wasn't as bad as everybody
6754000	6756000	made it out to be at the time. It just wasn't
6756000	6758000	a second Detsetsu game
6758000	6760000	really even though they kind of tried to make
6760000	6762000	it one.
6762000	6764000	Pika Uno says it would have to be
6764000	6766000	the platform that got me into gaming in the first place.
6766000	6768000	Commander Keen would have to
6768000	6770000	be 2D though.
6770000	6772000	Dark Tetsuya says with the resurrection
6772000	6774000	and Capcom Arcade cabinet, how about
6774000	6776000	a sequel or something to Black Dragon slash Black
6776000	6778000	Tiger? I want to say Magic
6778000	6780000	Sword was a sequel to it but there hasn't been another one
6780000	6782000	since that. Maybe they could implement Oculus
6782000	6784000	Rift support.
6784000	6786000	Tim Tripp says
6786000	6788000	Free Space? I'd just like to see the
6788000	6790000	return of the epic space combat genre.
6790000	6792000	Anomalous
6792000	6794000	Underdog says Vagrant Story.
6794000	6796000	I even thought of a name for it. Vagrant Army.
6796000	6798000	You know we used to call that fragrant story
6798000	6800000	because it stinks.
6800000	6802000	No, I know it's not bad but that was the
6802000	6804000	joke at my house. SSG100 Matt
6804000	6806000	says really? No one's going to say Chrono Trigger or
6806000	6808000	Chrono Cross? It's long overdue.
6808000	6810000	Slidekicks says with the upcoming
6810000	6812000	release of DuckTales Remastered
6812000	6814000	I'd love to see the return of more of
6814000	6816000	Capcom's classic Disney platformers.
6816000	6818000	Like a modern tale on the adventures
6818000	6820000	in the Magic Kingdom. It's a fun blend
6820000	6822000	of different games with a flawless Disney theme
6822000	6824000	and I think a new version would even be more
6824000	6826000	immersive. As long as it was more like
6826000	6828000	Nintendo Land and not so much like Connect Disneyland
6828000	6830000	Adventures which was sadly a big flop.
6830000	6832000	But here's the thing though, is that Connect Disneyland
6832000	6834000	Adventures kind of was Adventures in the
6834000	6836000	Magic Kingdom. I mean, they
6836000	6838000	really were the same type
6838000	6840000	of thing. It's just that Magic Kingdom
6840000	6842000	was out when you were a kid.
6842000	6844000	So it was like, you know, it held up
6844000	6846000	a little better than Connect Disneyland Adventures
6846000	6848000	did I think.
6848000	6850000	And lastly on Facebook, Shane says
6850000	6852000	Rising Xan. It will
6852000	6854000	leave you with a theme, and I'll leave you with a
6854000	6856000	theme song because that should be enough
6856000	6858000	to spike some second hand sales of the game.
6858000	6860000	How can anyone not love this? It's a Ninja
6860000	6862000	Cowboy.
6862000	6864000	Rising Xan was a fun
6864000	6866000	game.
6866000	6868000	I'm gonna skip ahead a bit.
6868000	6870000	I'm gonna skip ahead a bit.
6878000	6880000	I like the idea of a Ninja Cowboy.
6880000	6882000	But not as cool as the Ninja Pirate.
6882000	6884000	Uh, let's see. Anyhow,
6884000	6886000	going to Google Plus,
6886000	6888000	of which there's only four answers, but
6888000	6890000	Retertainment says Skate or Die.
6890000	6892000	That was a fun one.
6892000	6894000	Biz says Pokemon Snap.
6894000	6896000	Travis H says Shining
6896000	6898000	Force. Ooh, this is a good
6898000	6900000	answer. Act Def says Uniracers.
6900000	6902000	That game was awesome.
6902000	6904000	What?
6904000	6906000	Get out.
6906000	6908000	You know what was kind of a sequel
6908000	6910000	to Uniracers was Excite Truck
6910000	6912000	in a way. Like, the same type of thing with the stunts
6912000	6914000	and everything, mid-air and all that. A little bit.
6914000	6916000	A little bit. Alright.
6916000	6918000	Lots of great answers you guys,
6918000	6920000	except you all failed for
6920000	6922000	not mentioning the Guardian legend. Get out.
6922000	6924000	Honestly though, the Uniracer
6924000	6926000	or Unicycle should come back
6926000	6928000	as a Smash Brothers fighting
6928000	6930000	character. Yes.
6930000	6932000	It'd be pretty sweet. It'd be awesome.
6932000	6934000	Well I suppose if Sega can have Daytona
6934000	6936000	cars fighting, then we can have a fighting Unicycle.
6936000	6938000	That's right. Or at least as like
6938000	6940000	a power-up or something. Like Princess Peach can ride
6940000	6942000	the Unicycle around and do tricks or something.
6942000	6944000	I don't know. Alright, let's get back
6944000	6946000	to some more news. Loki.
6946000	6948000	Alright.
6948000	6950000	So they're doing this really
6950000	6952000	interesting promotion
6952000	6954000	I guess. It's Ouya's $1,000,000
6954000	6956000	Free the Games Fund.
6956000	6958000	They're boosting Kickstarter games.
6958000	6960000	Or Kickstarted
6960000	6962000	games I guess. So what's
6962000	6964000	going to happen is I guess between August
6964000	6966000	9th and August 10th
6966000	6968000	next year
6968000	6970000	any
6970000	6972000	or I guess a game will
6972000	6974000	qualify as long as it's achieved its
6974000	6976000	minimum goal of $50,000.
6976000	6978000	And Ouya
6978000	6980000	will match the total raised up to
6980000	6982000	$250,000.
6982000	6984000	So I'm guessing this is going to be
6984000	6986000	quite limited if you're
6986000	6988000	going to only have a million
6988000	6990000	dollars to shuffle around
6990000	6992000	and
6992000	6994000	you're going to pledge with
6994000	6996000	$250,000.
6996000	6998000	Also I guess the
6998000	7000000	game will receive an additional
7000000	7002000	$100,000
7002000	7004000	if I guess it's
7004000	7006000	one of the most
7006000	7008000	successful Kickstarter projects
7008000	7010000	to take part in the Free the Games program.
7010000	7012000	I believe
7012000	7014000	that the trick
7014000	7016000	with that, there is a big
7016000	7018000	but, you
7018000	7020000	need to have your game
7020000	7022000	exclusive for the Ouya for six months.
7022000	7024000	So
7024000	7026000	that's the only
7026000	7028000	drawback I guess.
7028000	7030000	That's cheating.
7030000	7032000	But hey, free money.
7032000	7034000	Money's good.
7034000	7036000	I don't know.
7036000	7038000	Money is always good, of course.
7038000	7040000	But don't they have to fix some of these other
7040000	7042000	problems, like their customer service and so forth first?
7042000	7044000	God, that's what I suggested. I'm like, hey, you know
7044000	7046000	the problem is
7046000	7048000	that you don't have enough games on the system.
7048000	7050000	Although more would be good.
7050000	7052000	More would be good, but I don't
7052000	7054000	think you're going to get, I mean look at this.
7054000	7056000	I understand that games
7056000	7058000	have budgets and stuff like that and
7058000	7060000	they can be quite expensive, especially if you have a team of people.
7060000	7062000	But
7062000	7064000	I don't know, for like an indie game, I would think
7064000	7066000	like $100,000 is
7066000	7068000	quite a bit. I mean
7068000	7070000	especially if you're talking like a small team of people.
7070000	7072000	And that's a
7072000	7074000	lot of money.
7074000	7076000	I think, I don't know. But even like
7076000	7078000	let's say if we're going to take the high
7078000	7080000	end here and you have $250,000
7080000	7082000	so a total of half a million dollars
7082000	7084000	for
7084000	7086000	a game, I mean that's quite a bit.
7086000	7088000	I mean it'd better be one hell of a good
7088000	7090000	game. I mean there's some pretty decent
7090000	7092000	games on there right now, but
7092000	7094000	I don't think any of them cost half a million dollars
7094000	7096000	or even $100,000
7096000	7098000	to make.
7098000	7100000	Alright well moving on
7100000	7102000	to a little
7102000	7104000	quote about a spinoff for
7104000	7106000	a very well received game from this year.
7106000	7108000	It has to do with the Tomb Raider series.
7108000	7110000	And Gail Simone,
7110000	7112000	who is a comic book veteran.
7112000	7114000	She is awesome.
7114000	7116000	What kind of other stuff is she doing? I don't follow comics.
7116000	7118000	She's the only, one of the only reasons I ever
7118000	7120000	read anything DC on purpose.
7120000	7122000	She did
7122000	7124000	what did she do?
7124000	7126000	Birds of Prey.
7126000	7128000	Even I know what that is because that was a CW show.
7128000	7130000	But
7130000	7132000	she is probably one of the
7132000	7134000	best female comic book writers
7134000	7136000	out there. Awesome. Well she's teaming up
7136000	7138000	with publisher Dark Horse
7138000	7140000	to work on a Tomb Raider comic.
7140000	7142000	But what caught people's attention was this quote.
7142000	7144000	She said quote,
7144000	7146000	In continuity it will be a Tomb Raider canon
7146000	7148000	and lead directly into the sequel.
7148000	7150000	This is what got me excited.
7150000	7152000	We get to be part of Lara Croft
7152000	7154000	history. Well they haven't
7154000	7156000	announced a sequel to Tomb Raider.
7156000	7158000	So this quote kind of
7158000	7160000	grabbed people's attention. Although
7160000	7162000	I mean let's be real. It would make
7162000	7164000	a lot of sense. Like you didn't
7164000	7166000	expect a sequel. Exactly right. Like the game
7166000	7168000	was well received. It did perform under.
7168000	7170000	Well but we all kind of
7170000	7172000	looked at that quote in the beginning and kind of went
7172000	7174000	really? Really with that
7174000	7176000	quote? Are people just pulling this way out of context?
7176000	7178000	A? Why not
7178000	7180000	A plus?
7180000	7182000	That's right. Well
7182000	7184000	plus I would think that if they're
7184000	7186000	going to make a sequel it's going to
7186000	7188000	likely use a lot of the same components
7188000	7190000	that were in the original. So like I'm saying
7190000	7192000	they don't have to necessarily reinvent the wheel
7192000	7194000	with a sequel. They can carry over
7194000	7196000	a lot of stuff that they did with the first game.
7196000	7198000	I mean granted they'd want to do bigger
7198000	7200000	better and all that other stuff but. How more
7200000	7202000	can we kill her more?
7202000	7204000	Right. But I would
7204000	7206000	think that you wouldn't necessarily maybe have to
7206000	7208000	put the same financial
7208000	7210000	investment into it
7210000	7212000	necessarily. So maybe you could
7212000	7214000	still get bang for the buck.
7214000	7216000	And maybe make up for this
7216000	7218000	perceived lack. Although
7218000	7220000	I don't know. Again
7220000	7222000	I still think it seems like the game's
7222000	7224000	done well. And I'm sure it sold a ton of extra copies.
7224000	7226000	What was it? Eight bucks on the steam
7226000	7228000	sale this week. And I'm sure there were a lot of people
7228000	7230000	that snapped it up for that. So.
7230000	7232000	I've had a lot of fun playing it
7232000	7234000	Some other comments from
7234000	7236000	Gail Simone. The storytelling in the game
7236000	7238000	hooked me instantly. The biggest difference
7238000	7240000	is the game told a claustrophobic
7240000	7242000	story in an isolated setting. We are
7242000	7244000	going globe trotting.
7244000	7246000	So maybe if there is a
7246000	7248000	sequel. If this ties into it.
7248000	7250000	It'll be more Laura exploring
7250000	7252000	rather than the whole you know escape from
7252000	7254000	you know Death Sentence Island.
7254000	7256000	She'll be seeking the legendary
7256000	7258000	elusive art thief
7258000	7260000	Carmen Sandiego.
7260000	7262000	Alright.
7262000	7264000	So. Anyhow.
7264000	7266000	Exciting that. I mean.
7266000	7268000	Although I think a sequel to
7268000	7270000	Good Game is a bit of a duh. It's still
7270000	7272000	exciting to hear that. Speaking of franchise
7272000	7274000	reboot. Carmen Sandiego.
7274000	7276000	I heard about
7276000	7278000	this. PBS has been teasing this
7278000	7280000	right? No. I was just saying they should do
7280000	7282000	a sequel. No. Like for real. Like PBS
7282000	7284000	on their Tumblr or Twitter
7284000	7286000	these things was posting these things
7286000	7288000	about like. No. No.
7288000	7290000	Actually no. It wasn't PBS. I think it was the people
7290000	7292000	that owned Carmen Sandiego or like her Twitter.
7292000	7294000	But like I think they're doing something where they're gonna
7294000	7296000	play the old game show
7296000	7298000	things again on PBS.
7298000	7300000	Somebody in chat can help me fill in the gaps. I just remember
7300000	7302000	picking up bits and pieces of this on Twitter.
7302000	7304000	But like I think they are setting the stages
7304000	7306000	for a Carmen Sandiego comeback. So it's funny that you
7306000	7308000	bring that up. Cause like. No. Legitimately
7308000	7310000	there's something to that. You know what would be
7310000	7312000	funny? If you
7312000	7314000	Where in the world is
7314000	7316000	Carmen Sandiego would have worked in the 80's?
7316000	7318000	But imagine like having
7318000	7320000	that now. People be like well just can't we
7320000	7322000	like do GPS and use CCTV
7322000	7324000	and all this.
7324000	7326000	Yeah we found her in 5 seconds. Oops.
7326000	7328000	Send a drone.
7328000	7330000	Or more like
7330000	7332000	What country? Where's that?
7332000	7334000	I've never heard of that country.
7334000	7336000	China. What is this? Oh stop.
7336000	7338000	Alright.
7338000	7340000	Roo that's made up.
7340000	7342000	You're
7342000	7344000	so ignorant. Alright Dark Soccer
7344000	7346000	what do you got? Stuff.
7346000	7348000	And it's not Carmen Sandiego.
7348000	7350000	It's about Atlas.
7350000	7352000	Basically Nintendo. Well you know
7352000	7354000	Atlas filed for bankruptcy and everyone's
7354000	7356000	worried about a
7356000	7358000	particular series of their Shin Megami Tensei.
7358000	7360000	Well Nintendo is buying it.
7360000	7362000	So we may see a Persona 5 Wii U.
7364000	7366000	Yeah you made a noise.
7366000	7368000	I'm sorry. Sorry no I was laughing at chat.
7368000	7370000	Sorry. But yeah.
7370000	7372000	Atlas kind of
7372000	7374000	screwed themselves.
7374000	7376000	But Nintendo seems to
7376000	7378000	be grabbing the hot one.
7378000	7380000	Because you know all the fans that was what they were
7380000	7382000	worried about. What's going to happen with a
7382000	7384000	Persona with a Shin Megami Tensei.
7384000	7386000	So it looks like Nintendo is saving the series.
7386000	7388000	I thought this whole
7388000	7390000	bankruptcy thing wasn't supposed to be this big of a deal.
7390000	7392000	And now here we're talking Nintendo's
7392000	7394000	snapping up
7394000	7396000	IPs? Yeah.
7396000	7398000	How did things go from A to Z
7398000	7400000	like that? Well they've already been working with
7400000	7402000	Nintendo in this series because remember the crossover
7402000	7404000	with Fire Emblem?
7404000	7406000	It was like if you have Shin Megami
7406000	7408000	Tensei 4
7408000	7410000	there had a
7410000	7412000	crossover promotion with Fire Emblem.
7412000	7414000	So if you had both of them you get like
7414000	7416000	$30 eShop credit in North America.
7416000	7418000	So
7418000	7420000	that was a big thing. But I think that
7420000	7422000	there's a
7422000	7424000	they're developing Shin Megami
7424000	7426000	Tensei cross Fire Emblem
7426000	7428000	for Wii U. So I think
7428000	7430000	it's gonna be
7430000	7432000	I think it's gonna
7432000	7434000	definitely be... I would be something
7434000	7436000	can you imagine if Persona 5 was a
7436000	7438000	Wii U exclusive? Now that's
7438000	7440000	that'd be a pretty crazy
7440000	7442000	grab there. Yeah it would be. But it's
7442000	7444000	smart. It's smart move.
7444000	7446000	Oh yeah.
7446000	7448000	Just real quick off
7448000	7450000	this is we were talking about Karma San Diego a second ago.
7450000	7452000	So I pulled up that article
7452000	7454000	that were on my LinkedIn chat and they were talking about
7454000	7456000	different things. And then at the very bottom of course it said
7456000	7458000	that
7458000	7460000	Shirlene Theresa Lynn
7460000	7462000	Thigpen the one that was the chief
7462000	7464000	on the show. Oh yeah she passed away. Yeah she passed away
7464000	7466000	in 2003 and stuff. But what I found a little bit
7466000	7468000	disturbing is on
7468000	7470000	Wikipedia it actually shows
7470000	7472000	where the resting place is. It tells you
7472000	7474000	which cemetery she is buried in.
7474000	7476000	What? There's a lot of Wikis
7476000	7478000	that do that. Wikipedia has that on a lot of
7478000	7480000	articles. That's kind of weird. Yeah no a lot of articles
7480000	7482000	say that. And then there's this whole other site
7482000	7484000	like there's a whole site dedicated... This is where they
7484000	7486000	are buried I think. Yeah there's a whole site dedicated to
7486000	7488000	like celebrity tombstones. I actually
7488000	7490000	I don't know if I should
7490000	7492000	mention this in the show. I have friends
7492000	7494000	that like do that. They go
7494000	7496000	visit them. Like when they go to L.A. they'll go
7496000	7498000	to the famous people. And I had
7498000	7500000	a friend that went to the Pacific Northwest recently
7500000	7502000	and went to some of those tombstones that are out
7502000	7504000	there. And you know I don't like
7504000	7506000	I don't know it's to
7506000	7508000	me I'm like no thank you not my thing
7508000	7510000	but they're not hurting anybody
7510000	7512000	it's all a sign of respect. You know
7512000	7514000	that's why they put tombstones out there so people
7514000	7516000	can go pay their respects and so forth
7516000	7518000	and you know my friends do this all tastefully.
7518000	7520000	But yeah there are websites
7520000	7522000	out there that have all the links to this stuff.
7522000	7524000	There's also
7524000	7526000	websites that display
7526000	7528000	famous death masks.
7528000	7530000	Because there's actually still people today who do
7530000	7532000	death masks.
7532000	7534000	For anyone who doesn't know what those are basically there's
7534000	7536000	a plaster cast made and then they're cast in
7536000	7538000	bronze or sometimes
7538000	7540000	clay or different things. But
7540000	7542000	the death masks are basically
7542000	7544000	the faces at death once they're
7544000	7546000	you know ready to be buried and saved.
7546000	7548000	But there's people who still do death masks to this
7548000	7550000	day and there's websites that have all the modern death masks.
7550000	7552000	So I'm going to have one done.
7552000	7554000	Do Walt Disney have one done?
7554000	7556000	I don't think so. I plan on having
7556000	7558000	one done though. Really? Isn't that expensive?
7558000	7560000	No. I know
7560000	7562000	how much plaster and stuff costs.
7562000	7564000	Yeah but you can't do it yourself.
7564000	7566000	No but I have. Rob how many artists
7566000	7568000	do I know? That's true.
7568000	7570000	It costs a lot to join that.
7570000	7572000	What did it call the Neptune Society or whatever?
7572000	7574000	The people that'll dump you at sea.
7574000	7576000	I told
7576000	7578000	my funeral
7578000	7580000	is going to be Jewish
7580000	7582000	and easy. Pine box
7582000	7584000	buried 24 hours later.
7584000	7586000	No embalming. I've already
7586000	7588000	mentioned I want to be flung out of a cannon
7588000	7590000	at my work building during the lunch
7590000	7592000	hour. That's all I want. We actually discussed what
7592000	7594000	Dan wanted today. What we're doing is we're
7594000	7596000	putting him in his 69 Mustang Coupe
7596000	7598000	loading it with explosives
7598000	7600000	pushing it off a cliff and blowing
7600000	7602000	it up in mid air. Awesome.
7602000	7604000	So Genki style
7604000	7606000	and Roger Corman style.
7606000	7608000	Fancy.
7608000	7610000	Yes. I am having
7610000	7612000	a Jewish burial and an Irish wake.
7612000	7614000	Are you calling us unoriginal?
7614000	7616000	Yes. Alright moving on
7616000	7618000	Loki. So
7618000	7620000	Harmonix is due some
7620000	7622000	sweet sweet money.
7622000	7624000	And that's because Viacom
7624000	7626000	they lost their appeal.
7626000	7628000	Which you know there was a whole lawsuit
7628000	7630000	I guess that they had owed
7630000	7632000	Harmonix some
7632000	7634000	money. And
7634000	7636000	that includes now
7636000	7638000	$299 million dollars with
7638000	7640000	interest.
7640000	7642000	So good for Harmonix.
7642000	7644000	That should fund some extra
7644000	7646000	tracks in Fantasia.
7646000	7648000	I guess now
7648000	7650000	it says Harmonix is
7650000	7652000	law firm estimate or estimates
7652000	7654000	including another dispute I guess
7654000	7656000	the company has for a total of
7656000	7658000	$533 million dollars.
7658000	7660000	That's a sweet chunk
7660000	7662000	of change.
7664000	7666000	Maybe that change
7666000	7668000	can go to making 3D versions
7668000	7670000	of all their old games cause that's what some
7670000	7672000	companies do. Although a 3D
7672000	7674000	amplitude would be pretty sweet you gotta admit.
7674000	7676000	But Sega is
7676000	7678000	jumping on the 3D bandwagon. We kinda
7678000	7680000	knew this was coming cause there's been hints about
7680000	7682000	the 3D Sonic already. But
7682000	7684000	Sega did make the official announcement that Sega
7684000	7686000	classic 3D titles for the 3DS are
7686000	7688000	coming to the west. So this isn't
7688000	7690000	just you know virtual console releases
7690000	7692000	they are redone in the 3D.
7692000	7694000	I wouldn't expect a whole
7694000	7696000	lot more. I mean that's
7696000	7698000	really it. Like I don't think they're going back and redoing all the graphics
7698000	7700000	or anything like that so don't get your hopes too far up.
7700000	7702000	But you will be able to experience
7702000	7704000	3D Altered Beast, 3D
7704000	7706000	Echo the Dolphin, 3D Galaxy
7706000	7708000	Force 2, 3D Shinobi 3,
7708000	7710000	3D Sonic the Hedgehog, 3D Space Harrier,
7710000	7712000	3D Streets of Rage, and
7712000	7714000	3D Super Hang-On. I think that should look
7714000	7716000	pretty cool considering that you know
7716000	7718000	some of the 3D converts we've seen so far have been
7718000	7720000	NES titles and now these are like 16 bit
7720000	7722000	so. 3D Space Harrier
7722000	7724000	is gonna be sweet. I like
7724000	7726000	3D Kid Icarus was really
7726000	7728000	cool. Like they didn't change a
7728000	7730000	lot but it was just like it was very subtle
7730000	7732000	like they added the backgrounds
7732000	7734000	very subtle updates that
7734000	7736000	made it really cool. Like I like that
7736000	7738000	one a lot. But like some
7738000	7740000	of the 3D remakes were a little silly
7740000	7742000	like 3D Wrecking or no not Wrecking Crew
7742000	7744000	with Urban Champion or whatever that was
7744000	7746000	a little silly. But yeah it'll be
7746000	7748000	cool to check out a couple of these
7748000	7750000	I don't know about 3D Altered Beast like
7750000	7752000	I don't... Wise Fumio
7752000	7754000	Grave. Like people remember
7754000	7756000	that epicness from the arcade when they were a kid
7756000	7758000	and stuff but like I played through the game recently
7758000	7760000	it's really not that good. It's really
7760000	7762000	not that good. But 3D
7762000	7764000	Sonic will be cool even though it'll be like the
7764000	7766000	17th time I've played Sonic.
7766000	7768000	But 3D Space Harrier. Yes I'm here for that.
7768000	7770000	Welcome to the fantasy zone. Get ready.
7770000	7772000	I'm getting ready.
7772000	7774000	My body is ready.
7774000	7776000	Are you in the fantasy zone Rob?
7776000	7778000	Yes. Alright are you in the mailbag
7778000	7780000	zone? Do we have you? Yes we have two.
7780000	7782000	We do have emails tonight. Woohoo!
7782000	7784000	Two whole emails. You can email us
7784000	7786000	too. Mailbag at orange
7786000	7788000	lounge radio dot com. Well great I better
7788000	7790000	pay attention cause I have no idea what these are about tonight
7790000	7792000	I didn't get to read them in advance. Well this comes from Brad
7792000	7794000	our pod culture Brad. Hi
7794000	7796000	pod culture Brad. At the end of part A
7796000	7798000	you guys said there were not any emails
7798000	7800000	yet so how about a kitty pic instead.
7800000	7802000	So they sent us a picture of his kitty
7802000	7804000	pat on the screen. Oh
7804000	7806000	that's adorable. Hi kitty.
7806000	7808000	Gee cat.
7808000	7810000	I'm gonna get to meet Brad in
7810000	7812000	five weeks. Kitty unfortunately cannot check in for points
7812000	7814000	for the VOG network cause kitty does not have
7814000	7816000	a cat phone. I am super pissed at my cat.
7816000	7818000	Why? Because she's trying to chew
7818000	7820000	on my 3DS charge cable.
7820000	7822000	And every time I move it out of her way
7822000	7824000	she's like uh uh I'm gonna get it.
7824000	7826000	Meow.
7826000	7828000	You need to buy her a shoestring or something.
7828000	7830000	I have toys for her. She plays with all of
7830000	7832000	Shermy's toys cause Shermy's too fat and lazy.
7832000	7834000	But except I won't give her
7834000	7836000	Shermy's mousy. But
7836000	7838000	you know what this house that we're looking at has a
7838000	7840000	cat door in it.
7840000	7842000	Hee hee. Nice.
7842000	7844000	Next email. Hey it's
7844000	7846000	Ricimo. I haven't called
7846000	7848000	I haven't emailed or called in like forever
7848000	7850000	but just a quick thank you for all your hard
7850000	7852000	work and dedication to your craft and to your
7852000	7854000	fans. I've been listening since I first
7854000	7856000	heard about you guys on Joystiq.
7856000	7858000	We were on Joystiq. We were on Joystiq.
7858000	7860000	When the hell did that happen?
7860000	7862000	Oh.
7862000	7864000	Uh
7864000	7866000	yes they used to do like a weekly
7866000	7868000	podcast thing and I think we were
7868000	7870000	featured once. Actually
7870000	7872000	I remember Playstation Joystiq
7872000	7874000	site did a really
7874000	7876000	nice write up on OLRPSP.com
7876000	7878000	some time ago. That was really cool.
7878000	7880000	And I want to say
7880000	7882000	probably when the whole
7882000	7884000	when the whole Katamari
7884000	7886000	thing happened years ago that was probably
7886000	7888000	on Joystiq. The president cat
7888000	7890000	thing was written up on I think that hit
7890000	7892000	a couple blogs and Joystiq was one of them too.
7892000	7894000	So it was a while ago. But I know Ricimo has been listening a while.
7894000	7896000	So yeah I guess we have got a few mentions.
7896000	7898000	Now we need to get Gaga Hamster.
7898000	7900000	Yes which by the
7900000	7902000	way just the Glamster
7902000	7904000	was what we were going to call it.
7904000	7906000	Kuma JP bless his heart did
7906000	7908000	do some research on Glamster
7908000	7910000	and they don't have a Twitter it seems like.
7910000	7912000	But he did get us the website.
7912000	7914000	It's Bergsala-lightweight.co.jp
7914000	7916000	So
7916000	7918000	that's
7918000	7920000	I mean so there's the official site and they actually have
7920000	7922000	a website for the Hamster game
7922000	7924000	which had a
7924000	7926000	very long Japanese name that I'm totally
7926000	7928000	mispronouncing. But DarkSakura decided last
7928000	7930000	week to simply call it Glamster which is a
7930000	7932000	fantastic name for it because it was
7932000	7934000	making the hamsters pretty and putting
7934000	7936000	them in pretty situations and so forth and we're
7936000	7938000	like why can't this game be out here. It's like the pretty pretty
7938000	7940000	princess of hamsters. So I wanted to bombard
7940000	7942000	their Twitter and try to take another social
7942000	7944000	media campaign like we did with President
7944000	7946000	Kat to its
7946000	7948000	horrendous success. But
7948000	7950000	but
7950000	7952000	no luck. There's no Twitter to bug
7952000	7954000	them through. But we'll
7954000	7956000	keep trying.
7956000	7958000	Of course you remember the
7958000	7960000	Katamari debacle of yesteryear.
7960000	7962000	I haven't missed a single episode and felt
7962000	7964000	the need to say thanks for getting me
7964000	7966000	through so many work days. I love you all.
7966000	7968000	Thanks once again. Sent from my iPhone.
7968000	7970000	Well that was very nice.
7970000	7972000	There was no questions or opinions
7972000	7974000	or I mean opinions. I like nice
7974000	7976000	emails. Thank you. That was just a good old fashioned
7976000	7978000	thank you. Especially
7978000	7980000	there was only one missing comma.
7980000	7982000	This is
7982000	7984000	quite pleased. Well and you're
7984000	7986000	welcome and thank you for that.
7986000	7988000	It's always really
7988000	7990000	awesome to see things like that. You get
7990000	7992000	an invisible gold star for awesome.
7994000	7996000	Yeah I got to say I so appreciate
7996000	7998000	the small gestures
7998000	8000000	people have done to just kind of say
8000000	8002000	thanks for all our like you know
8002000	8004000	code man got me Borderlands
8004000	8006000	too because I was bitching about wanting it last week
8006000	8008000	and he was kind enough to get that for me. That means
8008000	8010000	a lot. And I got a trading
8010000	8012000	card I wanted just because somebody
8012000	8014000	had it and was like hey I like
8014000	8016000	all our here have this I know you need it
8016000	8018000	and didn't expect anything in return and I was like
8018000	8020000	that's all. Even though those cards are only like 18
8020000	8022000	cents still it's just like the gesture is like
8022000	8024000	oh my god it's awesome. Usually the small gestures
8024000	8026000	I get are lewd.
8030000	8032000	I got a wiener for you DarkSakura.
8034000	8036000	Oh Slidekick found
8036000	8038000	our article.
8038000	8040000	Some Google foo.
8040000	8042000	About the president
8042000	8044000	cat. There you go. Oh he found the
8044000	8046000	he found the article from 2007
8046000	8048000	that was about O.L.R.
8048000	8050000	P.S.P.com I believe. This is 2009.
8050000	8052000	Which apparently no there's another
8052000	8054000	article look at the link there
8054000	8056000	that fixed info on DarkSakura
8058000	8060000	I wonder what they
8060000	8062000	said about you that was wrong who knows.
8064000	8066000	Anyhow.
8066000	8068000	I have to see this.
8070000	8072000	It's an old article. And I'll tell you what
8072000	8074000	probably updated it the last
8074000	8076000	time they ran that article.
8078000	8080000	You know actually I'm getting
8080000	8082000	the emails from GoDaddy
8082000	8084000	to renew OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8084000	8086000	which you know obviously that'll happen
8086000	8088000	even though we really need to do something
8088000	8090000	with that website to modernize it a little bit
8090000	8092000	and get it away from the hackers
8092000	8094000	but O.L.R. P.S.P.com
8094000	8096000	is up for renewal and I'm questioning
8096000	8098000	if I should renew it. Probably not.
8098000	8100000	However you can still
8100000	8102000	I feel like there's people that'll be pissed off
8102000	8104000	if I let it go. No no no no no no no hold on.
8104000	8106000	I just had a Facebook
8106000	8108000	comment the other day. You can still access it
8108000	8110000	by going to OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8110000	8112000	slash P.S.P. Oh okay.
8112000	8114000	So.
8114000	8116000	Alright then I feel better letting it go if that's
8116000	8118000	going to be the case. Yeah cause in fact I'll
8118000	8120000	still protect this real quick. You have such a cute kitty
8120000	8122000	Brad. Yeah I'm pretty
8122000	8124000	sure it's slash P.S.P.
8124000	8126000	I think that actually
8126000	8128000	yes yeah see if you
8128000	8130000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash P.S.P.
8130000	8132000	Okay well that's cool. Then then yeah
8132000	8134000	I might let O.L.R. P.S.P.com lapse
8134000	8136000	if there's still a way to get to it.
8138000	8140000	Alright. A lot of these pages
8140000	8142000	don't work anymore. Ranma secret message
8142000	8144000	send me some. I will.
8144000	8146000	Alright.
8146000	8148000	Tiger Claw says
8148000	8150000	why not change O.L.R. P.S.P. to a mobile
8150000	8152000	site. No.
8152000	8154000	Yeah I kind of feel the
8154000	8156000	same. It's like that's a lot of work to maintain
8156000	8158000	and I think a lot of the focus right now
8158000	8160000	is also on building VOG network
8160000	8162000	is kind of like the central hub and making that
8162000	8164000	bigger and better. The network's okay on mobile.
8164000	8166000	Yeah and that you know I think
8166000	8168000	the next step at some point for VOG will
8168000	8170000	be a mobile app but that's
8170000	8172000	you know in the
8172000	8174000	future. Ways away.
8174000	8176000	Don't get excited about that. Long
8176000	8178000	ways out. You'll probably see
8178000	8180000	it'll come out around the time Zelda's
8180000	8182000	finally out on Wii U.
8182000	8184000	Alright.
8184000	8186000	Let's see.
8186000	8188000	That's it for e-mails right?
8188000	8190000	Yarr. If you want to send us some
8190000	8192000	e-mails mailbag at orange lounge radio
8192000	8194000	dot com. That means it's the time
8194000	8196000	in the show when we do the FUs
8196000	8198000	of the week.
8198000	8200000	My
8214000	8216000	FU goes to this
8216000	8218000	cough that will not go away.
8218000	8220000	The conditions of some of the houses we've
8220000	8222000	seen because there were like burnt
8222000	8224000	carpet and cat pee smells.
8224000	8226000	Some of these like the HUD houses
8226000	8228000	oh my god it's so bad. And then
8228000	8230000	another FU just to the housing industry in
8230000	8232000	general because it's
8232000	8234000	really like this weird
8234000	8236000	huge mungus
8236000	8238000	legal ebay game with
8238000	8240000	houses. It's a pain in the ass.
8240000	8242000	But we found a cute one.
8242000	8244000	The conditions seem
8244000	8246000	favorable. Not gonna get my hopes
8246000	8248000	up too high but keep your fingers
8248000	8250000	crossed for us. We found a good one.
8250000	8252000	And
8252000	8254000	Rob it has
8254000	8256000	perfect accommodations for a new studio.
8256000	8258000	Nice.
8258000	8260000	I'll keep my fingers and my toes crossed.
8260000	8262000	Loki.
8262000	8264000	Just fuck you because I still don't have
8264000	8266000	a fixed controller yet even though it
8266000	8268000	sort of seems like it's going on the right track.
8268000	8270000	I thought the same thing back on July
8270000	8272000	1st and
8272000	8274000	look where we are now. So fuck them.
8276000	8278000	That's it? That's it.
8278000	8280000	My FU goes to the fact
8280000	8282000	that I can't follow through things on
8282000	8284000	things that I say I'm going to do and
8284000	8286000	convince myself that I'm going to do but then I'm just
8286000	8288000	like, but you
8288000	8290000	can't really do that even though you probably
8290000	8292000	should. Go to the gym Rob.
8292000	8294000	It's not even that I'm talking about actually.
8294000	8296000	I could put that on the list.
8296000	8298000	As one of many things. You should go to the gym
8298000	8300000	with me. I can't because you don't go to the same
8300000	8302000	gym I do. Yes I can.
8302000	8304000	I can get guest passes. Hello. You gonna switch?
8304000	8306000	No I can get guest passes.
8306000	8308000	That would work like once or twice.
8308000	8310000	And then they'd try to bully me into joining and I don't want
8310000	8312000	to join because I like the gym I've got.
8312000	8314000	Ours has got a heated pool.
8314000	8316000	Alright. Anyhow.
8316000	8318000	Back to
8318000	8320000	a couple more news stories in the
8320000	8322000	Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR
8322000	8324000	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
8324000	8326000	So
8326000	8328000	I guess that Namco is
8328000	8330000	prepping a HD
8330000	8332000	version of Soul Calibur 2.
8332000	8334000	Soul Calibur 2 HD Online
8334000	8336000	coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3
8336000	8338000	this fall. I'm assuming
8338000	8340000	it's a download title because I haven't seen
8340000	8342000	anything on here that says that
8342000	8344000	it's gonna be
8344000	8346000	released at retail.
8346000	8348000	I know I haven't heard of anything yet
8348000	8350000	about retail. But uh
8350000	8352000	yeah apparently the game
8352000	8354000	is gonna be
8354000	8356000	closer to HD now
8356000	8358000	and the outputting at 720p
8358000	8360000	um
8360000	8362000	I don't know.
8362000	8364000	Neat.
8364000	8366000	I'm assuming that the special characters aren't gonna be in the game.
8366000	8368000	He probably can't get spawner.
8368000	8370000	You know obviously Link's not gonna be back
8370000	8372000	because he was only on GameCube.
8372000	8374000	And Heihachi.
8374000	8376000	Yeah.
8376000	8378000	So no Link.
8378000	8380000	Yeah well yeah because that was GameCube.
8380000	8382000	So I don't know.
8384000	8386000	It's bad it's not coming to Wii U.
8386000	8388000	Yeah
8388000	8390000	that would be nice wouldn't it.
8390000	8392000	But you never know. I mean you never know.
8392000	8394000	I'm kinda not getting my hopes up.
8394000	8396000	Yes.
8396000	8398000	Yes it does. Be quiet.
8398000	8400000	Stop trolling.
8400000	8402000	Alright well one more news story for you guys
8402000	8404000	before we open up the Skype line and uh
8404000	8406000	I gotta say this is a really
8406000	8408000	crazy idea but I totally love it.
8408000	8410000	It's a site called
8410000	8412000	All You Can Arcade
8412000	8414000	and you can visit it at allyoucanarcade.com
8414000	8416000	In a nutshell
8416000	8418000	it's basically trying to be like a Netflix type thing
8418000	8420000	for arcade cabinets.
8420000	8422000	Yes it's a business where arcade
8422000	8424000	rentals are the focus.
8424000	8426000	For $75 a month
8426000	8428000	but we're talking cabinets people I know that sounds expensive
8428000	8430000	but basically you can
8430000	8432000	cancel your membership at any time
8432000	8434000	or whatever you sign up for this
8434000	8436000	and you can have 1, 2 or 3
8436000	8438000	games brought to you
8438000	8440000	and you can swap them out for a different one in stock
8440000	8442000	or whatever. Now it's only
8442000	8444000	in certain areas because they bring
8444000	8446000	the games to you which is pretty amazing.
8446000	8448000	It's only available in the San Francisco Bay Area
8448000	8450000	Stockton, San Jose, Sacramento
8450000	8452000	and Sacramento. Yes Sacramento
8452000	8454000	has it. So if
8454000	8456000	Dark Soccer wanted to do this or whatever
8456000	8458000	And I have a job now. Can we check this
8458000	8460000	stock? And they're saying
8460000	8462000	in order to help scale the business we're partnering
8462000	8464000	with other arcade coin operators and have our
8464000	8466000	have set our website up so that anyone who
8466000	8468000	owns a game can become an operator by listing
8468000	8470000	photos of their games for rent. They can also
8470000	8472000	set how far of a territory they're willing to cover
8472000	8474000	on their route and our system will automatically
8474000	8476000	find visitors who live within those zip codes
8476000	8478000	and match their games with local homes and offices
8478000	8480000	that want to rent them. This is actually aimed
8480000	8482000	at private collectors too
8482000	8484000	which is crazy.
8484000	8486000	I mean it's very ambitious.
8486000	8488000	I should probably share that with Dan's
8488000	8490000	pinball group. Yeah I mean
8490000	8492000	I didn't see if there were actually
8492000	8494000	but yeah some of the cabinets they have on here
8494000	8496000	most of them are old stuff but still
8496000	8498000	you know bad dudes
8498000	8500000	Ms. Pacman looking at the site
8500000	8502000	which we're totally just giving him free advertising
8502000	8504000	here but whatever it's a neat
8504000	8506000	idea and it's really taking the Netflix
8506000	8508000	thing to the next level isn't it? I love the totally
8508000	8510000	fake picture though. Oh yeah
8510000	8512000	these little gals playing in the game
8512000	8514000	and having fun. And the little black dresses and heels. Dude
8514000	8516000	versus Goonies that's awesome I want that.
8516000	8518000	That's cool.
8518000	8520000	Where can you view what they have?
8520000	8522000	All You Can Arcade dot com. Yeah I went there.
8522000	8524000	Signing up and
8524000	8526000	Oh you can actually browse games available in my area.
8526000	8528000	Wow. Where? I put in my zip code here
8528000	8530000	just in the upper right corner. Okay.
8530000	8532000	Bad Dudes, Berserk,
8532000	8534000	Donkey Kong, Galaga,
8534000	8536000	Golden Tee. This isn't all
8536000	8538000	of them I'm just looking at. Heavy Barrel is a good one.
8538000	8540000	Silkworm. Yes.
8540000	8542000	What? Silkworm. Dance of the Revolution Extreme.
8542000	8544000	Ha Ha. Get out
8544000	8546000	really? Yes.
8546000	8548000	Oh my
8548000	8550000	God there is a DDR
8550000	8552000	machine. But you were just looking at area.
8552000	8554000	Oh yeah I was
8554000	8556000	looking at area. This is looking at Sacramento.
8556000	8558000	It might not be available in your area necessarily.
8558000	8560000	But
8560000	8562000	still that's the type of game they're willing to
8562000	8564000	rent. One might show up Loki.
8564000	8566000	They need a 2DX on that list. Oh boy.
8566000	8568000	I will rent it forever.
8568000	8570000	Alright. Yeah I may
8570000	8572000	have to hog that if I actually. Hey if the idea
8572000	8574000	does well and I just totally gave them
8574000	8576000	free advertising. Dude
8576000	8578000	I would totally just want to buy
8578000	8580000	that. It's kind of neat.
8580000	8582000	So anyway. There you go.
8582000	8584000	That's it. That's it for the stories we had on deck
8584000	8586000	tonight. So we're going to open up our Skype line if you
8586000	8588000	want to give us a call. 1877
8588000	8590000	Game OLR. Our username on Skype is
8590000	8592000	JoshLoungeRadio. If there's something you want to talk about tonight
8592000	8594000	that we haven't brought up. We'll get to Twitter topics in a minute
8594000	8596000	here. But first some last minute stories.
8596000	8598000	Darsakha I think you said you had one tonight right?
8598000	8600000	I do and I seriously thought I'd put it
8600000	8602000	in my stories and I
8602000	8604000	didn't. So this
8604000	8606000	goes out to all the homestucks.
8606000	8608000	Basically Hussey. Oh God. Shut up.
8608000	8610000	Basically Hussey is
8610000	8612000	going to be working with Namco
8612000	8614000	doing a dating sim.
8614000	8616000	The game is called Namco High
8616000	8618000	and it is a fictional
8618000	8620000	crossover high school that all
8620000	8622000	the Namco characters are going to.
8622000	8624000	So it's yeah date high school
8624000	8626000	sim and
8626000	8628000	so basically
8628000	8630000	it's going to be Namco
8630000	8632000	character shipping the game.
8632000	8634000	Like everybody does with Homestuck.
8634000	8636000	So we're looking at characters from
8636000	8638000	Xenogears, Tekken
8638000	8640000	Idolmaster
8640000	8642000	Bites and Kratos so
8642000	8644000	here
8644000	8646000	we go with Pac-Man. That sounds weird.
8646000	8648000	I'm totally getting it.
8648000	8650000	That's weird it's like that one sim that they had
8650000	8652000	where you date like birds.
8652000	8654000	Oh
8654000	8656000	Hat's a Full Boyfriend.
8656000	8658000	Alright let's go to the phones.
8658000	8660000	Hi you're on Orange on a Treaty who's this?
8660000	8662000	It's the one and only Rama.
8662000	8664000	Rama how's it going?
8664000	8666000	Good good. I just got a
8666000	8668000	brand new mixer on Saturday.
8668000	8670000	Oh congrats. So we're going to be hearing
8670000	8672000	even more high
8672000	8674000	fidelity anime jam sessions soon.
8674000	8676000	Either that or lots of margaritas.
8676000	8678000	That'll happen
8678000	8680000	provided Junami doesn't knock the desk
8680000	8682000	over. Don't invite him to your house.
8682000	8684000	I told him he
8684000	8686000	had to sign a release form first.
8686000	8688000	In Junami's
8688000	8690000	defense he came over on the 4th of July and didn't
8690000	8692000	knock anything over. Good job. No
8692000	8694000	he actually needs to come back to the show.
8694000	8696000	It's been far too long.
8696000	8698000	That sounds pretty cool.
8698000	8700000	Well congrats on your new mixing board. What else is up?
8700000	8702000	Not much
8702000	8704000	but I want to
8704000	8706000	stand behind Loki
8706000	8708000	and join him
8708000	8710000	in the lynching of
8710000	8712000	Uya because I have my own issues when it comes
8712000	8714000	to gaming customer service and
8714000	8716000	I was just close to literally
8716000	8718000	losing my shit on Facebook and
8718000	8720000	Twitter before they got
8720000	8722000	back to me.
8722000	8724000	Why don't you air your grievances here?
8724000	8726000	Long story short
8726000	8728000	I bought a headset
8728000	8730000	by Astro Gaming because I played
8730000	8732000	them at PAX East last year and I
8732000	8734000	loved them. So what happened was
8734000	8736000	there was a short in the headset or
8736000	8738000	the mic was dead. After
8738000	8740000	waiting for the perfect time to pack up
8740000	8742000	everything I pack up
8742000	8744000	the microphone, the headset and the mixer
8744000	8746000	because I was having troubles with that too.
8746000	8748000	Sent it out. Two weeks later I get
8748000	8750000	a brand new mixer
8750000	8752000	a brand new microphone
8752000	8754000	same headset. And I'm looking
8754000	8756000	at the new mixer and they're telling me the battery
8756000	8758000	that I had works for it but
8758000	8760000	the new mixer doesn't use the battery.
8760000	8762000	There's a couple extra connectors on there
8762000	8764000	I can't even use my optical out because they
8764000	8766000	change that. So I'm like whatever
8766000	8768000	I can work with it. I can still do my
8768000	8770000	podcasting and the music and so forth.
8770000	8772000	Plug in the mic. Everything is working
8772000	8774000	well. A week later
8774000	8776000	the mic starts shorting out
8776000	8778000	again. So
8778000	8780000	I contact them and I'm like
8780000	8782000	okay what they're probably going to do is send me a
8782000	8784000	new kit. I pack up everything and send it
8784000	8786000	back. They're like no we need you to pack up
8786000	8788000	everything. Send it to us and we'll send it
8788000	8790000	back to you. And I'm like
8790000	8792000	I use this for every day. I can't be
8792000	8794000	without it. They should say
8794000	8796000	okay we'll send you a two day
8796000	8798000	UPS label.
8798000	8800000	I'm like you're not helping me here.
8800000	8802000	So I
8802000	8804000	end up going on their Twitter, their support
8804000	8806000	Twitter asking for help. I go
8806000	8808000	on their Facebook asking for
8808000	8810000	help explaining everything
8810000	8812000	and I actually went as far as when I was
8812000	8814000	at PAX East this year speaking to our
8814000	8816000	rep at their booth to get this taken
8816000	8818000	care of. Wow that's dedication
8818000	8820000	to the cause. I packed
8820000	8822000	up all my equipment took it down.
8822000	8824000	It's because I actually like
8824000	8826000	the quality of the equipment. It's just
8826000	8828000	their customer service sucks. And
8828000	8830000	every email I get back from them
8830000	8832000	they don't
8832000	8834000	have everything commented back. I've been sending
8834000	8836000	an email. They keep responding back with
8836000	8838000	the original complaint on the open
8838000	8840000	ticket. I'm like are you guys not
8840000	8842000	reading this? I'm sending them
8842000	8844000	specific information about what's going on
8844000	8846000	and how I want the situation resolved.
8846000	8848000	I get a generic response
8848000	8850000	coming back. Friday I
8850000	8852000	check Twitter. I get a private message from
8852000	8854000	their support saying they're so
8854000	8856000	sorry since nothing has happened.
8856000	8858000	No one's gotten back to me and it's been
8858000	8860000	30 days. I get in my email
8860000	8862000	an actual phone
8862000	8864000	number where I can call them and talk to them
8864000	8866000	and explain the whole situation.
8866000	8868000	Wow.
8868000	8870000	But did that actually fix it finally?
8870000	8872000	Not yet because this past weekend
8872000	8874000	I took a semi sort of sabbatical.
8874000	8876000	I just stepped away.
8876000	8878000	Just did my own thing. Tomorrow
8878000	8880000	I'm going to call and just get this
8880000	8882000	taken care of. Because like I said
8882000	8884000	the headsets, the mixers.
8884000	8886000	The stuff's really good. I can't complain
8886000	8888000	because I use it for podcasting.
8888000	8890000	Listening to music. Gaming on
8890000	8892000	my consoles. But when it just
8892000	8894000	comes to support it's just like it lacks
8894000	8896000	and people's defenses.
8896000	8898000	They're mostly an online based
8898000	8900000	company. You're going to
8900000	8902000	be able to only contact them via email.
8902000	8904000	I'm like no. There are other online
8904000	8906000	companies where you can contact them not just through
8906000	8908000	the forums. Support. Email.
8908000	8910000	Phone number. All that stuff.
8910000	8912000	Sadly I think there's a few too many companies
8912000	8914000	willing to cut corners on customer service
8914000	8916000	and it shows.
8916000	8918000	Yeah.
8918000	8920000	Alright well anything else. Any other grievances
8920000	8922000	you want to air on tonight's OLR?
8922000	8924000	That's it. I'll just say this. If you
8924000	8926000	buy this, buy it from Best Buy.
8926000	8928000	Get their service plan.
8928000	8930000	It'll save you a lot of frustration
8930000	8932000	and hair on your head. Fair enough.
8932000	8934000	Alright. You take care Rama.
8934000	8936000	You too bro. Alright. Bye bye.
8936000	8938000	Alright. Always good to hear from our buddy Rama.
8938000	8940000	Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here at
8940000	8942000	The Voice Eagles Network. Totally.
8942000	8944000	We wait for more calls at 1877
8944000	8946000	Game OLR or our username on Skype
8946000	8948000	Orange Launch Radio. Loki do you have anything for last minutes?
8948000	8950000	I don't have any last minute stories
8950000	8952000	but I'd like to once again
8952000	8954000	because I threw around this idea on
8954000	8956000	Twitter and now I think I'm going to move
8956000	8958000	forward with it which is
8958000	8960000	the Loki's 24 hour
8960000	8962000	total noob game jam
8962000	8964000	basically an experiment
8964000	8966000	because I've been going through this whole
8966000	8968000	game making thing and actually just
8968000	8970000	reading up a lot on programming
8970000	8972000	and unity and all that fun stuff
8972000	8974000	and now I just want to get my hands dirty
8974000	8976000	with it and so
8976000	8978000	the experience basically
8978000	8980000	I'm going to spend 24 hours putting the
8980000	8982000	other game. Now obviously unlike
8982000	8984000	regular game jams I don't have enough time
8984000	8986000	to sit. It's not 24
8986000	8988000	consecutive hours. Yes. Hold on because our
8988000	8990000	phone's lighting up. We'll come back to
8990000	8992000	your thoughts in a minute here but let's go to
8992000	8994000	the phones. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio
8994000	8996000	who's this? Hey hey hey
8996000	8998000	it's lokilives46. Hey it's
8998000	9000000	say that again it's
9000000	9002000	lokilives46
9002000	9004000	lokilives46 but
9004000	9006000	no relation to rloki?
9006000	9008000	No no no unfortunately not.
9008000	9010000	I guess it is a commonly
9010000	9012000	used name from. Wait where did you
9012000	9014000	get yours? Yours did not come from
9014000	9016000	like Thor or anything. Yours came from
9016000	9018000	the mask. I'm a fan of Jim Carrey. The mask
9018000	9020000	way back when right? But some people
9020000	9022000	Yes yes I was originally
9022000	9024000	it's actually a bit of a persona
9024000	9026000	I've taken up. Oh.
9026000	9028000	Yeah it was a very
9028000	9030000	mischievous little brat. Wait so yours is
9030000	9032000	inspired from the mask too?
9032000	9034000	Absolutely. Wow.
9034000	9036000	You guys are kind of like distant cousins
9036000	9038000	distant cousins or something. Alright.
9038000	9040000	Well I won't make you talk about your name anymore
9040000	9042000	loki2
9042000	9044000	or loki46.
9044000	9046000	What's on your mind tonight?
9046000	9048000	Just sort of
9048000	9050000	clearing up the discrepancies here but
9050000	9052000	I'm a bit of a
9052000	9054000	tech geek myself.
9054000	9056000	Well so are we. You're in good
9056000	9058000	company here at the Voice Geeks Network. I think we're all
9058000	9060000	a little nerdy.
9062000	9064000	Anyways how have things been going for you guys?
9064000	9066000	What's that? How have things been going
9066000	9068000	for you guys?
9068000	9070000	Fantastic.
9070000	9072000	How are you doing
9072000	9074000	DarkSakura? That's what the listeners want
9074000	9076000	to know. How the hell are you? I want this house.
9076000	9078000	You want this house that you're looking at?
9078000	9080000	She's house hunting. I'm longing.
9080000	9082000	Yes. But I'm employed now so
9082000	9084000	that's good. And our loki is full of
9084000	9086000	gummy bears but he just ran to the kitchen real quick.
9086000	9088000	Those gummy bears
9088000	9090000	I pity his poor soul right now.
9090000	9092000	Fine. What you're not a gummy bear fan?
9092000	9094000	What's up with that? No
9094000	9096000	it's just that high concentration of sugar.
9096000	9098000	I'm allergic to them. No I already
9098000	9100000	ate some of them but
9100000	9102000	there's no way I'm going to eat a ton of them.
9102000	9104000	They'll seriously make me feel sick.
9104000	9106000	Alright fair enough.
9106000	9108000	Anyways I'll let you guys get back to it.
9108000	9110000	Okay fair enough. No games you want to talk
9110000	9112000	about tonight or anything? What have you been playing?
9112000	9114000	I've just been crazy busy
9114000	9116000	with work so I haven't really had a chance to.
9116000	9118000	Well you better
9118000	9120000	get on that last
9120000	9122000	day of the steam sale. Last chance
9122000	9124000	he gains at a discount put all that money
9124000	9126000	to use.
9126000	9128000	Oh my wallet doesn't like those steam sales
9128000	9130000	I'll tell you that much.
9130000	9132000	Alright buddy well thanks for the call you take
9132000	9134000	care. Yeah you too. Alright bye.
9134000	9136000	He just
9136000	9138000	called to ask how the hell are you?
9138000	9140000	Alive and kicking.
9140000	9142000	It's hot. It's very courteous.
9142000	9144000	Yeah it is a little hot isn't it? It's not even
9144000	9146000	like one of those. It's getting hot in here.
9146000	9148000	I'll make sure the AC is on while
9148000	9150000	I think it doesn't. Aren't you guys cooking a pizza
9150000	9152000	or something? Oh yeah he's making a baked
9152000	9154000	potato or something. Yeah I see.
9154000	9156000	I'm sure these walls are really insulated
9156000	9158000	with the oven beaver. Yeah sorry.
9158000	9160000	Alright well while I make sure our AC
9160000	9162000	is at full blast
9162000	9164000	so it's not 24 consecutive
9164000	9166000	hours. Not 24 consecutive hours because I just can't
9166000	9168000	I can't get that amount of free time
9168000	9170000	anymore.
9170000	9172000	So it'll be 24 hours total but it's
9172000	9174000	kind of cool because what I'm hoping to do
9174000	9176000	is actually have some well
9176000	9178000	I want to live stream it
9178000	9180000	we'll see if that's feasible or not depending on
9180000	9182000	where I actually have to record and the times and that
9182000	9184000	kind of stuff. I would like to live
9184000	9186000	stream. At the very least it's going to go up on YouTube
9186000	9188000	and I want some sort
9188000	9190000	of interactivity with that
9190000	9192000	so obviously chat room
9192000	9194000	will be involved and
9194000	9196000	I want to actually have polls at different parts
9196000	9198000	you know during it
9198000	9200000	like the first is going to be I think
9200000	9202000	you know what concept should we go
9202000	9204000	because I can make anything so
9204000	9206000	what are we going to make you know
9206000	9208000	I'll come up with like a couple ideas
9208000	9210000	and then maybe people vote on it and we'll go from
9210000	9212000	there and then later on as we get more
9212000	9214000	into it and hell I don't know
9214000	9216000	if I'll actually create a game in 24 hours because I've
9216000	9218000	never made anything before but I think I
9218000	9220000	can do it. I love how you're doing your game jam
9220000	9222000	I've never made a game before but I'm pretty
9222000	9224000	sure I could do one in 24 hours. Maybe
9224000	9226000	I don't know.
9226000	9228000	We'll try it I mean look at hell
9228000	9230000	I watched a video where someone made a game in 3 minutes
9230000	9232000	I mean it can be done it's just it's
9232000	9234000	going to be a good game
9234000	9236000	It's like the noob night
9236000	9238000	that Bobby and I keep talking about for
9238000	9240000	Borderlands 2 except your noob night is
9240000	9242000	programming. Yeah I think it'd be fun
9242000	9244000	I just kind of want to do it so yeah
9244000	9246000	as Bobby suggested make a poll on the
9246000	9248000	forums so yeah I'll start off with doing that and we'll
9248000	9250000	do updates in there and stuff
9250000	9252000	and see where it goes
9252000	9254000	because I think it'd be fun. I think you should try to make one
9254000	9256000	of the OLR dream games. No no see I knew you would
9256000	9258000	say that I knew you would say that but here's why
9258000	9260000	I don't want to do that because I want to make if I'm going to make
9260000	9262000	one of those it's got to be a good game I don't want to make
9262000	9264000	my first experiment at like something that's going to suck
9264000	9266000	one of those
9266000	9268000	games no offense it's just you know
9268000	9270000	I'd rather do it when I'm able to make something
9270000	9272000	a little bit better you know
9272000	9274000	it's a dream game after all we're not going to like just
9274000	9276000	crap out something. Fair enough
9276000	9278000	you want to make sure that it's
9278000	9280000	the time is taken to get it right. Besides I have a lot of
9280000	9282000	really crazy ideas for things
9282000	9284000	I mean all sorts of silly
9284000	9286000	things. Alright let me quickly
9286000	9288000	go to some tweets at twitter.com slash
9288000	9290000	OLR looking at
9290000	9292000	a few tweets here s2100
9292000	9294000	Matt tweeted us about going to
9294000	9296000	EA's NHL 94 anniversary
9296000	9298000	mode party in New York City and
9298000	9300000	he actually took some footage that he posted over
9300000	9302000	on Facebook and yeah I saw
9302000	9304000	that earlier in the week and it looks pretty cool
9304000	9306000	I like how they put that mode in there
9306000	9308000	to kind of you know with the stars under the
9308000	9310000	player and all that to kind of go back to the classic
9310000	9312000	and I heard EA
9312000	9314000	didn't really like him taking some of that footage but
9314000	9316000	I'm glad his rogue footage
9316000	9318000	made it to Facebook after all.
9318000	9320000	Tigerclaw sending us a couple tweets
9320000	9322000	Oculus Rift is planned for PC
9322000	9324000	and mobile but consoles not a focus
9324000	9326000	which I suppose would go
9326000	9328000	a ways in wasn't there some
9328000	9330000	rumor about Playstation 4
9330000	9332000	getting Oculus Rift at some point I want to say
9332000	9334000	right around E3 there was some wank on that
9334000	9336000	Honestly it can support any platform
9336000	9338000	it's just it's HDMI inputs
9338000	9340000	it's basically
9340000	9342000	it just has to output that display and it
9342000	9344000	can work with pretty much anything so
9344000	9346000	well
9346000	9348000	actually no I take that back it's a little bit more complex
9348000	9350000	than that but yeah I think they said consoles
9350000	9352000	that you know one time and
9352000	9354000	obviously if it has native support for
9354000	9356000	Unreal 4 you know
9356000	9358000	both consoles can run that
9358000	9360000	and
9360000	9362000	you know source and I'm not really sure what
9362000	9364000	other engines are going to be supporting it natively
9364000	9366000	but more and more are
9366000	9368000	supporting it so I wouldn't see why not
9368000	9370000	Alright also Tigerclaw
9370000	9372000	letting us know that a new side scrolling Teenage Mutant
9372000	9374000	Ninja Turtles game is coming in October
9374000	9376000	Activision
9376000	9378000	talked about this in a press release it's based on the
9378000	9380000	Nickelodeon version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
9380000	9382000	You know they're doing a new movie right? Yeah I knew that

9406000	9408000	and you got to book that shit in advance
9408000	9410000	but yeah sadly

9412000	9414000	to run after the show but I will invite
9414000	9416000	the other listeners if you want to play some Left 4

9430000	9432000	Well I guess that's going to do it for our Skype line tonight
9432000	9434000	and I
9434000	9436000	guess it's going to start to do it for the end of our show
9436000	9438000	It's starting to get really hot in here you
9438000	9440000	guys it's been a hot day in Sacramento
9440000	9442000	and then we're running the oven right now because
9442000	9444000	I guess Alan started dinner so it's like
9444000	9446000	I think it's time for us to wrap
9446000	9448000	up and get on out of here so sorry it was a little bit
9448000	9450000	shorter of a show tonight but we'll be back next week
9450000	9452000	to do it all over again
9452000	9454000	Won't we? Yay

9460000	9462000	I guess
9462000	9464000	But before we end the show we have to go around and give everybody's
9464000	9466000	final thought
9466000	9468000	DarkSakura your final thought tonight
9468000	9470000	Um
9470000	9472000	Words
9474000	9476000	Loki your final thought tonight
9476000	9478000	Uh
9478000	9480000	I wonder how long it's going to take me to get all those
9480000	9482000	coming bears
9482000	9484000	My final thought is
9484000	9486000	I'm going to need to really convince myself
9486000	9488000	not to buy Rogue Legacy
9488000	9490000	while it's at least 20%
9490000	9492000	off during the Steam sale and I was holding out
9492000	9494000	for a deeper discount or
9494000	9496000	else I'm probably going to end up buying that later tonight
9496000	9498000	because I do want to get that I've heard a lot of good things about it
9498000	9500000	Damn it
9500000	9502000	Damn you Steam sale
9502000	9504000	You should have gotten Little Inferno Damn you
