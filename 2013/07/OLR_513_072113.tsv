13903	26515	Tonight, July 21st, 2013, a long-awaited Nintendo Classic finally hits Wii U Virtual Console, a dormant franchise reemerges with a new game announcement at Comic-Con, and things get heated with one EA Sports franchise.
31803	37025	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37085	38946	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
39046	43227	This is episode number 513 July the 21st, 2013.
44888	49350	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about all things video gaming.
49830	50190	TechMasterLoki
72012	74214	I'm working on a bag of three pounds of gummy bears.
74274	78438	I was going to say, you brought a lot of different stuff with you, fun things to the show tonight.
78898	84483	One of these things you brought to the studio with you, a giant package of Haribo gummy bears.
85363	89747	And not that I'm complaining, gummy bears are amazing, but that's three pounds.
89787	90388	That's a lot of...
90908	91588	Gummy Bears!
119505	121366	and so, you know, it kind of paid for itself.
121466	121926	There you go.
121986	125327	Well, gummy bears are always exciting and you know I'm going to steal some before the night is over.
125867	133130	So, you've kind of had a busy week and before we get into our gaming weeks and all that stuff, I want to talk to you about some of the variety of things that's gone on this week.
133390	137371	But of course, I do want to introduce the always present fourth guest in our show, The Chat Room.
138251	148815	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
149495	174180	and uh even though Bobby's opinion on games sometimes can be very wrong uh we do still support all our indie podcast friends even when they don't agree with you that Super Metroid is the greatest game ever made I mean how how geez how can somebody not think that but diversity I suppose we have to embrace a diverse environment all right it's fine it's it's gonna be the greatest game ever made up until Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out and then you know
175420	176420	Things might change.
176641	179421	You are trying to pressure me into the Grand Theft Auto V. I might have to do it.
179722	186344	You know, I've been taking a break from the MMOs lately because all my friends quit World of Warcraft, basically.
186484	187344	No, I shouldn't say all.
187564	190985	I have some friends that play World of Warcraft still, but very few.
191105	196227	Like, I signed in for the first time today in like six days and I had a bunch of friends that were like, oh my gosh, where have you been?
197667	202888	But I've been really able to catch up on a lot of single player games like Steam and stuff like that, which I'll get into in my gaming week.
202968	206749	But Grand Theft Auto 4 is still sitting there on the list of things I need to do.
206769	207529	You need to play it.
207549	209090	Yeah, I know.
209190	209650	I know I do.
210390	210670	All right.
211050	212910	Going to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
213150	216091	Ranma wants to know, are they vodka infused gummy bears?
216691	217151	No, not yet.
217171	220252	No, it's more like heat infused gummy bears that have been sitting in my car.
221072	222373	And I've actually seen it before.
222413	230157	What happens if they sit in my car for a very long time, it will literally conform to the bag and it'll be just one solid mass of gummy bears.
230357	239102	LokiLives46, I don't know if that's in reference to your name or if you just both happen to be Loki, but LokiLives46 says that's almost a gross amount of sugar, man.
240103	249308	I won't eat them all in one day because it's seriously, right now it feels like I have a weight in my stomach because I finished eating dinner and then I had this.
249448	250088	Star Trek Enterprise
271722	275986	It's one of those mini... It comes in, like, the plastic bag things, and, you know, it's not too difficult.
277007	280350	I was building during Bobby's show, and I'm... Well, not the whole thing, like, last 10 minutes.
280370	281291	I'm already almost done.
281631	284453	But where did you get this from, and what's been going on?
284594	288517	I got it from the Namco Bandai rep, because they came to my work this week.
288917	292400	We do this, like, kind of a... Well, it used to be a game summit.
292420	295563	Now it's, like, an entertainment summit, because they have a couple movie studios coming.
295603	296604	Now there's also the...
297825	305013	Other things that we sell as well, including Wonder Chalk, which is like this modeling chocolate stuff now.
307016	311160	So yeah, so they had a bunch of game companies out and stuff, and they show us what's coming out.
312702	316783	I got to see a few different... I mean, we'll talk about some of this stuff in Game Week, I guess.
316803	318184	But I got to see a few different things.
318644	321664	There was a few guys that brought dev kits with them.
322105	326066	Ubisoft brought Splinter Cell Blacklist, so I got to play a little of that.
327846	331427	Takuma Koei, they brought... What was it?
331527	335568	Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z, so I got to play the E3 demo of that.
336428	341770	And I didn't actually play it, but Activision brought Skylanders Swap Force...
342670	348053	I did follow the toys a little bit because there was no one at the booth at the time.
348133	352715	So I was looking at them and the top and bottom halves are held together with magnets.
354135	355156	As you would expect, I guess.
355996	357497	Magnets, how do they work?
360038	365721	I was very disappointed that Disney did not bring their Disney Infinity stuff.
366001	367821	They only had a video, which I've already seen.
369582	370403	And what else?
370683	376845	Well, it's neat that they were able to bring stuff to your work at all because there's other game stuff going on right now.
376865	378586	There's a lot of stuff going on at Comic Con.
378626	380807	It seems even more gaming news this year than usual.
381087	382708	And then PAX Australia, which...
383968	386469	Oddly, haven't been hearing a lot coming out of PAX Australia.
400934	406318	There hasn't really been a lot of news broken at PAX Australia, but I'm sure it's been really cool for them to just experience PAX.
406938	411041	And, you know, getting all the nerds in one place and the big gaming rooms and all that.
411121	414203	But my favorite part, see, about the whole thing was actually something that didn't even take place.
414263	418506	Well, it took place at the event, but more of the after event, like the dinner.
419106	421348	Okay, so I have a couple reps that work at different companies.
421548	425551	One guy, my friend Daniel, he's worked at a bunch of different companies.
425791	427072	I've known him since he's worked at...
427512	445682	Konami, Namco, D3, he's working at D3 now and then there's also Len who actually he owns a company now he owns Maximum Games Maximum Family Games they do a lot of like you know family product and
446002	446902	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
469068	473691	A long time ago, like back when they were launching the Genesis, you know, a long time ago and stuff.
473931	476072	And so they were telling me so many stories.
476512	477673	It was just fantastic.
477733	495843	First off, Leonard was telling me stories about how, because he, you know, since he owns the company and stuff, they deal a lot with, you know, shipping to Brazil and stuff and about all the difficulties with that and how you get product in there and stuff and how you have to, you know, almost like bribe officials and stuff to get things in there is crazy.
495883	495983	But
496904	498805	The stories from Sega were great.
498865	512275	They were talking about how they came up with... I guess they announced the core system for the Sega Genesis at... Not E3, CES one of these years or something.
512535	516878	They were telling... I guess everyone was saying, oh, that's a brilliant idea and stuff.
516918	521702	Because it was the first time that they had ever come out with a game system that was actually called a core system.
521762	522122	It's kind of...
523903	524884	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
548157	550940	They were asking them, so what do you guys think about the 32X?
550960	559887	Do you think this is going to be something that's going to work for consumers and stuff and how they're saying it's such a bad idea and everything?
561268	561568	I don't know.
561609	563230	It just sounded like a lot of fun.
563250	575220	I wish I could have got the guys on the show to talk about that kind of stuff, but obviously they don't want a lot of the stuff coming back verbatim because some people would get butthurt about that kind of stuff.
575260	575340	Yeah.
575632	578293	Okay, total derailment here, but you're in the background of my vine.
578313	579174	Can I still post that?
579354	579894	Oh, I don't care.
580194	580815	Just making sure.
580895	586017	I always ask permission before I post people's face on the internet, but I wanted to show off my Lego Enterprise because I finished.
586498	586958	There you go.
588258	595062	Well, I'm glad you got to reminisce with people and old friends that have moved from company to company and catch up on some of the drums, right?
595262	596164	Yeah, it's fun.
596645	605179	And then also, my other guy, my other friend from, I guess, it's not really a publisher, but he's a rep firm.
605700	607043	He works with...
609694	610455	Oh, what is it now?
610575	611655	It's Watten Company.
612376	613336	He works with them.
613696	614757	I don't know.
614777	617999	There's a lot of these guys I've seen for a long time because they've been here every single year.
618039	620800	There's a few reps that cycle through and stuff.
621421	623022	I did get to meet with Microsoft.
623862	624422	Oh, my God.
624562	625183	I swear to God.
625443	632507	One thing you'll learn about Microsoft if you're in the industry and stuff and if you actually get face-to-face contact with some of these reps...
633428	636212	They're different than everybody else.
636452	641399	You'll talk to them and you get this vibe from them.
642140	645745	It's just very much the Microsoft way of doing things.
646746	647367	For example...
648488	658996	We were actually sitting down and having lunch, and my coworkers started asking him questions about the Xbox One and all the critical stuff about the Xbox One and stuff.
659036	664980	And just listening to the guy spin stuff, I mean, obviously, he's kind of along the lines with how we're thinking.
665540	676107	It's really early, and a lot of this stuff is going to change, so he can't really say too much about what it's going to be in the final product, considering that they can just...
677168	681670	Turnaround, but just like such the, well, we were listening to the consumers and blah, blah, blah.
682951	686353	For example, I set up items for our company.
686533	689254	I set up items, and I don't have any of the first-party setup information.
689334	694437	So I asked Microsoft, hey, can you provide me a list of the UPCs for the stuff that you have coming out?
695177	700620	Yeah, we're sorry, because you see, you guys don't really buy direct from us, so you're going to have to ask somebody else.
701040	701801	What the fuck?
702241	704762	Oh, but we're supporting you guys.
704782	705843	That's why we're out here today.
706423	706663	What?
707464	709305	Okay, fine.
709385	712827	You can't give me stuff to set up the items in our system so that we can sell your product.
713067	716910	I just won't bother pushing for that since... Was this not sell your product then?
717330	717810	I don't know.
718131	720552	The whole thing's a corporate script, Loki.
720572	721473	It's ridiculous.
721533	727377	This was the weird thing at E3, too, is that there was just such the corporate script that nobody was going to deviate from.
728237	730378	Basically, everything benefits them.
730698	735480	They say they're thinking about the consumer, but it's always what's going to benefit Microsoft.
735500	736660	And that's what it comes down to.
736680	740422	And that's everything that I've talked to them and listening to their spiel and stuff like that.
741502	742883	And this isn't something new.
742923	746924	This has been around since the first year of Microsoft.
748705	751566	It's never about, like, here's the upcoming games we have and stuff like that.
752966	754467	You guys need to sell more of our accessories.
755285	756105	You need to sell more.
756966	759546	This is how you should be upselling these games.
760227	763788	When someone orders a Halo 4, you should ask them, do you want a year of live with that too?
763828	767109	I'm like, dude, first off, I'm not selling retail for one.
768369	773291	And two, my customers order live cards when they need them and stuff.
773311	774992	They don't need to be pushed for that stuff.
776052	776952	I remember the first year.
777152	778193	This is when the Xbox 360 launched.
780308	799703	our guy who is actually higher up now he's like yeah you guys need to be selling you need to be pushing the accessories cool but you're not shipping any to us because they're allocated we want to order them we're trying to sell them but you're not shipping any and now you're telling us that we need to push them but we can't because you're not shipping any to us
800990	801450	It's hilarious.
804072	805213	It's like banging your head against the wall.
806294	808756	Well, you know, it's the line.
809356	811238	That's the stuff they're trying to sell and push.
811638	814860	Sony on the other end, I must add, asks them the same thing.
815040	817242	Hey, I need setup information for your UPCs.
817462	818463	Guy gives me his card.
818503	820825	He says, send me an email and I'll get you the information you need.
821465	822446	Was that so fucking hard?
822506	822926	And guess what?
822946	824407	We don't buy direct from them either, so...
825489	826332	Perfect example.
828057	832130	It shouldn't be that difficult to get information from them to sell their product.
832509	832829	Yeah.
832849	834149	Hi, Jamie.
834169	834810	What he just said.
834890	835050	Hi.
835190	835890	Hi, welcome to the show.
835950	837190	How are you?
837790	838190	Hopeful.
838811	839751	You smell like sandwich.
839791	840631	Did you bring a sandwich?
840651	841291	I brought Panda.
841491	842251	Oh, okay.
842511	842932	You were so wrong.
842952	843792	I haven't eaten all day.
844032	844472	That's fine.
844672	845032	That's fine.
845352	845612	All right.
846412	851474	Loki, one other thing I want to ask you about, especially now that DarkSakura's here to hear this, the Ouya thing you've been tweeting about.
851554	851754	Oh, God.
851814	852414	Yeah, come on.
852434	853474	What's up with the Ouya stuff?
853494	859576	Okay, so since I've gotten my Ouya, I don't even know if you've noticed on that controller that since you're borrowing the system now...
860996	862197	The analog sticks are fucked up.
885632	887714	So, it was a defect.
887794	890497	It was a defect that was in the first run of those controllers.
891578	895962	And it's something that's documented, and it's something I tested, and I saw the same thing that they came up with.
896502	902848	So I've been trying to get it replaced recently, because I know they've been busy with the launch and stuff, and it's just getting a hold of customer service.
903329	909355	I started my claim, or I should say my support ticket, back in June, on the 25th.
911691	916177	And the first response I got from them was kind of a canned response.
916197	918520	Because everyone's asking, you know, where's my Ouya system?
918700	925309	So it was all this information about, you know, when your Ouya system's coming and how to track it and all that stuff.
925329	925930	I'm like, well...
927111	928192	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
943801	945302	I keep responding back to the thread.
945322	948225	I'm like, hey, where do we go from here?
948806	949526	What's going on here?
950087	952009	And so then finally I get a response back.
952849	959496	Your replacement faceplates have been sent out because I guess there's some problem with some of the faceplates and so people are requesting the faceplates.
960828	961308	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
978900	979000	E.A.
978980	979321	's does that
995513	1002979	I'm just saying, so it took me filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, which they already have, you know, looks like a few complaints against them already.
1003120	1008404	They're not part of the Better Business Bureau yet.
1009165	1010566	And that didn't really do anything.
1010626	1013348	So then I had to complain on Facebook or Twitter.
1013949	1019153	And so finally got the attention of their community manager.
1019193	1021135	And she kind of got the ball rolling a little bit.
1021175	1023357	And I finally got another response saying that I was supposed to be
1023977	1026439	He's forwarding my thing to the RMA department.
1026479	1029101	So still, I don't have a fixed controller.
1029241	1031203	I mean, literally, I could have gone out to the store.
1031983	1042271	It's not the right way to do it, but I could have gone to the store, bought a brand new Ouya controller, and took it back, took my old controller back as defective, and got my money back, and could have had it replaced weeks ago.
1042391	1045814	But, you know, I wanted to do it through the proper channels.
1046334	1049196	Although, if I get dicked around for another couple weeks, I am going to do that.
1049517	1051258	So, that's where I'm at.
1051278	1052559	I still don't have a fixed controller yet.
1055399	1055940	What a mess.
1056640	1056821	Yeah.
1057061	1058462	Customer service is so important.
1058482	1061125	Their customer service is absolutely terrible.
1061405	1064268	And this goes just the full gamut.
1064328	1066690	It's just not been good at all.
1066971	1069193	And yeah, I understand that they're a new company, but come on, man.
1069333	1072656	They've been dealing with customer service issues for the last three months now.
1072696	1075259	They should be a little bit more on top of it.
1075319	1075539	I mean...
1076680	1079783	Just even getting back to people in a timely manner.
1080243	1081784	Or reading the email.
1081924	1086768	If you're going to respond back to somebody, read through what the whole problem is.
1086828	1090831	When you're saying, oh, I'm going to send you replacement faceplates, that's not going to fucking fix the problem.
1091932	1092292	I don't know.
1092412	1094274	It's just strange.
1094934	1095094	But...
1096755	1100437	And now they've got some more news about what they're trying to do to drive up sales and stuff.
1100738	1107922	And even their response to the NPD numbers this month, they're saying, oh yeah, the Ouya launch hasn't been very successful because they haven't sold that many units.
1107942	1109503	And they're like, well, we sold out of all of our units.
1109523	1110723	We're chasing demand right now.
1110984	1112985	Yeah, because your manufacturing is so fucking slow.
1113665	1114966	But I don't know.
1115066	1118248	I'm just kind of over that system already.
1118268	1121910	It kind of felt like it was a whole mistake to back it in the first place.
1122390	1123591	Well, Dan said he wanted one now.
1125154	1126855	And I'm like, no, we're not getting one.
1127255	1128655	I'm putting my foot down.
1129135	1130556	It's not terrible.
1131196	1133817	And I think it's going to get better because it's just a system right now.
1133837	1138379	It's all up to the developers and what they're coming out with and stuff.
1138399	1142700	And they even had some stuff that came out of their little game jam thing that they did that looked really cool.
1143320	1145541	But not a lot of it's actually been made yet.
1145581	1148082	There's a game called Television that I wanted to play.
1148102	1149143	It was kind of this weird...
1151604	1152584	Thank you for watching!
1169774	1173256	and hell, it can't even access, you know, external storage devices yet.
1173656	1174737	None of that stuff's happened.
1176118	1180840	It can't, you know, it doesn't have any sort of online multiplayer.
1180880	1185883	There's no, like, any, you know, sharing of, like, there's no friends-less things built into it.
1185923	1186463	There's nothing.
1186523	1189345	It's just very rushed, I guess.
1191558	1195121	WhatUpG asks in chat, who has great customer service?
1195721	1196782	I can think of a few companies.
1198123	1201866	I'll say my car insurance company, AAA, has always been really good to me.
1202546	1204167	I can't really complain about them at all.
1204888	1207089	I would say the masters of customer service.
1207129	1208390	I've never seen anyone do it better.
1208530	1208871	Disney.
1209491	1209991	Disneyland.
1210031	1214595	But I'm saying as far as game industry, I actually had really good customer service with Blizzard.
1214715	1214855	Okay.
1216736	1218057	Yeah, a few times I've had to call.
1218077	1218937	I had really good service.
1219057	1227502	I don't like how long I've had to wait in some of the hold times, but once you get through to somebody, yeah, my experiences with Blizzard has been good.
1228482	1229123	I can't complain.
1229763	1238247	The best, or one of the best, is supposed to be Zappos, but I've never really ordered from them, although I've met the people at the company, and they're all really great.
1238287	1239308	They're all shoes, right?
1239848	1242711	Their shoes and clothing and stuff, they did get into electronics for a while.
1242731	1246334	I actually sold them games for a little bit, but they're really great.
1246434	1248876	I mean, just everybody there is fantastic.
1249336	1251298	They're a very unique corporate culture, too.
1251318	1251618	Oh, yeah.
1251638	1252258	It really works for them.
1252278	1253139	It's really cool.
1253880	1256182	None of the executives have offices there.
1256262	1259564	They're all down there in cubicles with everybody, and it's just very...
1260405	1264787	It's good morale, and just everybody is really happy to work there, and I think that's how you do it.
1264807	1268208	You keep people happy, and they will be happy.
1268228	1271529	I mean, if they're pissed off at their job, they're not going to be happy to your customers.
1272509	1276570	The place that I just got hired for believes the same thing, and everyone looks super happy there.
1276590	1278191	I'm not going to say where I got hired, but still.
1279146	1283407	Technus in chat says, Costco has amazing customer service, returns with no question asked.
1284287	1286587	They changed some of that policy lately.
1286607	1292208	I mean, I think they still probably have the most liberal return policy in most companies, but it's not as crazy as it used to be.
1293169	1295189	Tiger Claw asks, Rob, you're a corporate trainer.
1295249	1296569	Do you teach customer service?
1297069	1298710	I did for seven years.
1299070	1306151	And obviously, just due to separating my day job and my hobby, I'm not going to tell you where I work or much more than that.
1306671	1333916	but yes I taught customer service for seven years and I actually still even though I am still a corporate trainer I teach something else I sometimes teach customer service elements and I still write some manuals relating to that but so that's why it's important to me and I think you know a lot of companies I hate it when they let it go because one of the biggest things about customer service is just having to have the mentality like I want to do good things
1335016	1336638	That's 90% of it right there.
1337238	1340821	So anyway, I won't get into too much more than that.
1341782	1343763	A lot of people in chat saying Amazon.
1344404	1346425	Ranma saying Newegg is great customer service.
1346485	1348687	Bonds006 says, how can I forget Nintendo?
1348707	1349648	They have yet to let me down.
1351189	1354352	And I've worked in customer service for a solid eight years.
1354792	1358535	So trust me, when you're in it, you know what not to do.
1358555	1358755	Yeah.
1359756	1360936	I've called people out on stuff.
1362597	1368058	Yeah, and I've actually, when I get good phone service, which I can't remember the last company I got it from.
1368098	1371279	It's just been, I don't actually call places a whole lot.
1371299	1373480	I kind of prefer to do interactions online myself.
1374420	1380441	But the last time I called somebody, I got such good customer service, I actually said, can I talk to your manager and leave a compliment?
1380741	1381602	You know what I usually do?
1381702	1383142	They love that.
1383712	1384593	Actually, you know what's even better?
1385073	1388255	If you like someone's job, ask for the fax number, fax them a letter.
1389235	1397560	Because when I worked in customer service before, verbal compliments were really good, but written compliments were like the gold star.
1397620	1398700	They were the diamond star.
1398840	1404824	And if you're willing to do that, not waste your time, spend your time doing something like that.
1405244	1406845	I got 14 of them in one year.
1407525	1409026	I got taken out to dinner five times.
1409046	1410207	Little this show off.
1410287	1413650	No, it was that one year that we were so super busy and I worked all that overtime.
1414250	1420034	But I actually just sort of gave up on the call time and ended up helping out whoever it was because it was really freaking busy.
1420835	1422616	And it's one thing when you have 255 calls in queue.
1422636	1423516	When your queue max is 255.
1423556	1423777	Yeah.
1423837	1423937	Yeah.
1428553	1430034	Anyway, I don't know how we got on that tangent.
1430054	1430815	Oh yeah, OUYA stuff.
1430855	1436461	But anyway, anything else about your antics this week you want to share with us, Loki, before we get into Gaming Weeks?
1437001	1437642	That's pretty much it.
1437742	1442006	Alright, let's get into how was your Gaming Week and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.
1442366	1443287	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1443527	1444088	Animal Crossing.
1444808	1445089	Still?
1445629	1445829	Yep.
1446130	1447131	Is my DS around?
1447151	1448252	I gotta make sure our 3DS is mate.
1449753	1450374	I turned mine on.
1451054	1451735	Mine's been on all day.
1451895	1455497	Actually, when I went to South Sac yesterday, I street passed two people there.
1456078	1460161	I have no idea who, but there were two people in South Sac, so if you're listening, I street passed you totally.
1462282	1466445	And then, yeah, I actually, let's see, I've just expanded my second room.
1467065	1472850	So I've expanded my upstairs, I've expanded my house twice, the upstairs once, and
1473470	1477712	My side room once, my other side room once, and I'm going to be expanding my basement.
1477732	1479672	I have like 56,000 bills left.
1480933	1483253	Okay, anyone who wants a tip, fish on the island.
1483994	1485454	Fish on the island, cat sharks.
1486175	1488215	Throw everything back if they're not a shark.
1488535	1490096	I've heard beetles on the island.
1490436	1491696	Yeah, some of the Beatles, not all of them.
1492557	1493737	The Goliath ones are worth some money.
1495437	1498558	And I finished Little Inferno.
1499318	1500298	That game is weird.
1501379	1502799	That was the one where you set things on fire, right?
1502819	1503559	Yes, I love that game.
1503619	1504019	Good times.
1505420	1508360	And that's really about it because I've been job interviewing.
1508980	1510821	I've been shopping for professional clothes.
1510941	1512441	But congrats, you got the job.
1512521	1515122	And I know you don't want to say, well, you'll tell me all about it off air, but...
1515464	1515804	DarkSakura.com
1539772	1542753	Well, what a positive time between that and the house stuff.
1542813	1546975	Yeah, we found two really good houses today, and we put out an offer on one of them today.
1547155	1547375	Nice.
1547835	1550556	And a little two-bedroom house, but we have a big office in it.
1551376	1552016	Fingers and toes crossed.
1552036	1553017	And my own bathroom.
1554517	1554797	All right.
1554837	1555978	So, yeah.
1556018	1557898	Is that the one out, I guess I can say Antelope?
1557918	1558478	Was that the one in Antelope?
1558518	1559078	In Antelope.
1559099	1560139	That's going to be a bit of a drive.
1560259	1562800	It'd be a schlep, but it'd be a watt to 50 for me to get to work.
1562820	1563360	That's not bad.
1563960	1567345	E3 demo for Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z
1580083	1580884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1607084	1614949	Um, and said somehow it let me kill the zombie and then I couldn't finish the demo, which is kind of funny, but I've already seen how it ends.
1614989	1616350	So yeah, it wasn't that big deal.
1617450	1626576	Um, and then I played a bit of a Splinter Cell Conviction, which honestly I have, um, or not conviction, Splinter Cell Blacklist.
1627136	1627656	That's a new one.
1628577	1628677	Um,
1630518	1630958	Thanks for watching!
1649515	1649936	Thanks for watching!
1668715	1669135	And what else?
1669495	1671036	I played more Super Meat Boy.
1672957	1676818	I pretty much got all the A-pluses for the first level.
1677478	1680640	I'm working on the second level, and that includes both Dark and Light worlds.
1681440	1685341	And I got all of the bandages.
1685922	1689083	So now I have... Who did I unlock?
1689363	1693004	I unlocked the robot from Macarium, I think.
1693144	1694445	And then also...
1696807	1701397	Oh, what's his name from, um... I don't even remember now who it was.
1701978	1703321	Just a bunch of other characters.
1703422	1705165	Oh, the alien from Alien Hominid.
1706067	1706709	And, um...
1708416	1709297	Some other character.
1709317	1710217	I don't even know who it is.
1710237	1711398	It's from some other indie game.
1712398	1718202	I'm trying to get the guy from Minecraft because he has the coolest kind of special attack.
1718522	1719743	You can actually dig through the level.
1720463	1726767	ShadowNextGen in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Loki, the mark and shoot mechanic was also in Splinter Cell Conviction.
1726807	1727427	You should check it out.
1728268	1728428	Okay.
1731883	1739386	And then, before the show, I got sent the beta for Mercenary Kings, which is a game I backed on Kickstarter.
1741026	1741667	And it's awesome.
1741887	1749069	It looks very much like a metal slug, but it's not.
1749569	1752871	You can craft weapons in the game because you collect things.
1753291	1758292	It's really hard and all really awesome hand-drawn pixel art.
1759533	1759613	Um...
1761587	1761867	I don't know.
1762228	1764830	I played it for about 15 minutes and it was pretty sweet.
1765090	1768253	It's just I never finished the first level because I had no fucking clue where I was supposed to be going.
1768273	1773457	I was supposed to be rescuing one guy and I went all through the level because it kind of plays a little Metroidvania, I guess.
1773878	1784487	They're very open levels, but since I have no map or don't know where I'm supposed to be going, I kind of wandered the level for a while and couldn't find who I was supposed to be rescuing because you have a time limit.
1785568	1785648	Um...
1787165	1787886	Shadowrun Returns
1803345	1805747	I need to check on Shadowgate returns.
1806167	1807148	I know I backed that kickstart.
1807188	1808789	I've only backed like two maybe.
1809109	1809429	Oh, no, no.
1809649	1813352	Because there were the two recently because we had them both on the network that I backed.
1813692	1820397	But then there was also, you know, I'm starting to see the rewards for GamerCon, or as they call it, GamerX, is next weekend.
1820738	1822399	That's like actually happening, which is pretty cool.
1822419	1825481	So I'm just financing the reaping the rewards of that.
1825801	1831646	And then Shadowgate was the only other thing I've ever kickstarted outside of the Professor Shy Guy thing.
1833067	1843353	so I'm still waiting for that to come out which I think is later this year so I'm excited about that yeah so um I think that's all I played this week I didn't I wanted to play some other stuff I installed a few games um
1845402	1846242	So yeah, that's it.
1846583	1850705	Although there's going to be lots of taking up of time, so I don't know if I'll get into a lot of these games.
1851245	1855187	Saints Row the Third, still have a few achievements left I need to get.
1856447	1856727	Okay.
1857588	1858308	So my gaming week.
1858508	1861710	I've played quite a bit of different things, just kind of like a potpourri of stuff.
1861930	1865912	And I think not playing MMOs right now because I'm kind of holding out.
1866012	1874956	I know Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn is going to be the next big thing I get sucked into, but it's not really out until mid-August, whenever the early launch and the next beta phase happen and all that.
1875416	1876897	So I'm kind of in this lull right now.
1876937	1880698	World of Warcraft, most of my friends are on hiatus.
1880738	1884619	They've either just gone off to play other things or they're going to play XIV or they quit or whatever.
1884999	1886840	There's just not a lot of people still playing WoW.
1886860	1889861	There's just a couple people I still run into, but not a lot.
1889901	1895923	So I sign into WoW maybe once every few days, play a PvP Battleground, try to talk to people, but that's about it.
1896383	1898964	So I've been using this time to kind of catch up on single player things.
1899484	1902004	And Steam sale obviously has been a huge contributor to that.
1902784	1904185	The trading card metagame.
1904645	1907485	I actually did my badge today for the summer sale.
1907505	1910886	So I got my summer sale badge and it gave me a friends list boost to five people.
1911446	1912566	Not everybody would get that.
1912606	1914547	That's just I think you get like a random loot.
1914847	1916227	And I got a background for my profile.
1916247	1920668	So now when you go visit my profile on Steam, which is I think GreenSky42 is my external name.
1921528	1925189	You can actually see like my little trading card backgrounds, you know, just silly thing.
1927310	1928630	So, yeah, there was that.
1929471	1931871	Thanks to that, I kind of was playing some more games on Steam.
1932672	1939094	A few things to note, Skyrim, I started randomly playing the other night because, you know, Skyrim is that game you can just get sucked into.
1939134	1940215	Yeah, cards, partially cards.
1940455	1942356	I got all of my cards in one sitting.
1942596	1945737	That'll tell you how I got sucked into Skyrim one night, right?
1946337	1946998	So there's that.
1947558	1949799	But then the other game I got really sucked into, Torchlight 2.
1950979	1954482	I bought it I didn't play it, but I bought it
1973539	1974300	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1990856	1991236	Good times.
1993157	1999699	Speaking of live streaming, after the show last week, Shane made me play Slender the Eight Pages and do a live stream.
2000359	2001000	Oh my god.
2001020	2003461	That game was scary.
2003781	2004841	But I beat his score.
2005181	2006842	He's only gone as far as two pages.
2006982	2009823	I got to three pages by sheer dumb luck.
2010403	2018608	and I live streamed the whole thing and I had the lights out so like all you could see is my silhouette and the lights from Alan's computer because I had like my little webcam in the corner.
2018848	2026753	It's all in the archive on my channel at Twitch TV Rob Roberts and I did have a jump scream where I literally screamed once.
2027373	2051831	and uh Shay I just he started laughing and then I bust up laughing it was really funny but it was scary like I was in this like bathroom area looking for a page and I turned the corner and he was right there and the music did the bong and like the tentacles were coming out and everything it was like ah so I let out this big screech so that was fun uh even though you know I probably won't play that again anytime soon but that was that was a good thrill for that
2052285	2053326	Final Fantasy VII Final Fantasy VII
2079901	2102677	but the whole cloud saving feature is busted and I don't know if it's just because so many people bought it when it went on the flash sale yesterday but like I could not save my game yesterday that's very frustrating and stupid like if the cloud thing doesn't work the game should still let you save locally by default but I could not say and I streamed this whole thing happening I couldn't save to a local file that's ridiculous come on
2103517	2110584	I realize that Square's trying to tie everything together online to do the boost level thing and everything, but it's ridiculous.
2110604	2114347	It should always save locally and then to the cloud.
2114387	2115188	Yes, right?
2115868	2121073	So I have to really dog Final Fantasy VII for that cloud-saving thing because it does more harm than good in this case.
2121514	2124897	I'm hoping they fix it, but it did not leave a good impression.
2125197	2128560	Who wants to replay the first hour of the game again?
2128820	2129260	I mean, well...
2129941	2131983	I guess I did play it for the first time.
2132003	2133644	But like the first time in a few years.
2134765	2136386	Not the first time since yesterday.
2138368	2143292	Jason in our chatroom, VXJasonXV at live.vognetwork.com says, Cloud can't save Aeris.
2143332	2144713	You expect him to save your game?
2146294	2146655	Lol.
2147355	2147896	I would hope.
2148356	2149397	My cloud would have stabbed her.
2152785	2153185	Let's see.
2153325	2154406	I'm also looking here.
2154486	2157587	TigerClaw says Rob needs to play more scary games on Twitch.
2158168	2158968	It's a possibility.
2159008	2159709	It's a possibility.
2160089	2161410	I'm trying to play a variety of things.
2161450	2162590	Just sometimes classic things.
2162610	2165632	Too bad you don't have the Oculus Rift and then play like a Slender game.
2165792	2166313	No!
2166333	2167974	You know what, by the way, Rob?
2168094	2171296	I did remember one other video game related thing we did last night.
2172036	2173677	We watched the live stream of Video Games Live.
2174582	2176908	Oh yeah, I saw part of that.
2177068	2180096	I decided to stream at the same time it was on, which is probably why nobody was watching.
2180517	2181940	I'm amused by David Hader's ponytail.
2183539	2189522	I don't remember what I used because my computer I had to format the hard drive so I don't have my program anymore
2211214	2213836	FFSplit, I did not get as good a performance out of that as I did.
2213956	2221221	I mean, it's nice because that's free and everything, but I got a better performance out of OBS.
2221261	2221681	Let's see.
2221902	2231048	Also trying to read through our chat room real quick at live.vognetwork.com I guess that's it for now for chat comments, but we'll get some more of these later.
2231248	2233170	Some folks commenting on a story that's coming up.
2233870	2257595	but I think I got everything in my gaming week oh one other thing I should throw out there on the Wii U this week and I'm spoiling the news a little bit but it's my own story Earthbound was out on the Wii U this week I played a bit of that on virtual console it's nice to revisit that game after a very long time I played it on emulators once like years ago but to be able to like play it again on the TV and on the little gamepad is is a nice experience it's
2258195	2260056	That is a great, great RPG.
2260136	2261116	One of my all-time favorites.
2261176	2261717	It really is.
2261797	2272421	Like, I know Bobby's been razzing me a little bit about the whole Super Metroid versus EarthBound thing, but I'm always kind of like, but EarthBound really is like a really good game, and I don't find EarthBound to be overrated.
2272461	2275523	It's not my favorite game, but it's probably in my top five.
2275603	2276683	Honestly, I love EarthBound.
2276723	2277123	It's great.
2277684	2277824	So...
2278544	2279644	Glad to be playing that again.
2280165	2282005	And glad to hear they didn't really change a lot.
2282105	2284266	The changes they made, very minor stuff.
2284606	2288428	They made one dialogue change, and I don't even think it was that big a deal.
2288528	2294810	And they changed some of the graphic effects to tone down the amazing seizure displays that some of the side effects have.
2294830	2295591	You mean the embryos?
2296071	2296271	Hmm?
2296511	2297291	You mean the embryos?
2297451	2298111	Yeah, right?
2299312	2301113	So, yeah, good times.
2302793	2304895	Okay, so that's it for our gaming weeks.
2305616	2312501	Quick housekeeping, twitter.com slash orange, excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR or facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to follow us.
2313242	2318566	And of course, do support the other shows we have at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
2319206	2322589	I do not, and this is going to be news to you guys, so sorry to spring this on you mid-show.
2322649	2326932	We will not be here in two weeks because I'm going to be at that convention in San Francisco.
2326992	2327793	I won't be back in time.
2328353	2330335	So, because Sunday's the last day, so.
2330695	2330995	Sorry.
2331236	2331496	Okay.
2331596	2332036	Sorry about it.
2333658	2334519	No show in two weeks.
2334899	2335359	Surprise.
2336280	2348731	Well, maybe I don't keep that flexible because maybe I'll be back early enough or we can do something a little later or something, but I just... I totally want to take over the stream and do a fuck-off show.
2348812	2350073	Yeah, do whatever you want.
2350193	2351514	It's called Jamie Rants.
2351634	2352675	Or do a live stream.
2352855	2354957	Loki can play Borderlands whenever.
2355177	2355978	I'm not playing Borderlands.
2356118	2356579	GameBooey
2382822	2385363	Game Bar, and more.
2385683	2387063	Special surprise guest, hopefully.
2387924	2397687	All talking about podcasting and kind of our own shows and trying to enable other people to do their own shows and enable more broadcasters.
2398267	2404169	It is a GLBT-focused convention, obviously, but we're really about everybody having a voice.
2404509	2404849	Good times.
2407170	2410792	Alright, let's get into some news.
2411032	2411292	Loki.
2411892	2412132	Yes.
2412752	2413433	Pokemon Rumble.
2414753	2423277	I'm actually kind of surprised that this is coming out still digitally, but Pokemon Rumble was a game that came out in Japan, I think earlier last year, maybe this year.
2425538	2430101	It was a digital download for the Wii U, and what makes it kind of unique is it...
2431753	2438118	Sort of going the Skylanders route where you have these physical figurines that you buy for a certain amount of money.
2439159	2451007	And you, I think you put them on, I don't know if it's, I want to say it was the near field communication part of the Wii U tablet or the game pad or whatever.
2451568	2452689	And it interacted with that.
2453229	2456451	So it is coming out over here in North America, August 29th.
2458592	2479809	18 figurines however they are sold exclusively at Evil G so if you watch your Pokemon you know Nintendo has still made this blood pack with Evil G to do that the game I guess is 18 bucks in the eShop each figurine is going to be $4 I don't know
2482825	2483105	Neat.
2484746	2486087	Yeah, why not?
2487388	2492351	Except for the fact that it's a GameStop exclusive, but something to hold us over until X and Y, right?
2492471	2495413	Europe is also going to be getting the game August 15th.
2495974	2500516	No words on how they're going to, if that's going to be done through GameStop in Europe as well.
2500837	2501177	I don't know.
2503016	2503717	It's kind of lame.
2503797	2504097	I don't know.
2504117	2512223	I just don't understand why they're making... I mean, I understand they're a big company, but why exclusive through GameStop to do this stuff?
2513604	2514865	I don't know why they would do that.
2514885	2519108	I mean, because honestly, I think everybody could sell those stupid figurines.
2519148	2520829	Hell, they put out the game as like a disc.
2521010	2522591	I'm surprised they didn't do that in the first place.
2522611	2523611	$20 game, you know?
2526208	2526889	Super Luigi U's on disc, right?
2526909	2527169	It will be.
2549987	2557331	which sadly makes sense because Nintendo's trying to push people to the Wii U and there are people crazy enough to buy a Wii U to play EarthBound.
2557491	2558491	But you can't play it at my house.
2559292	2561633	Especially considering how much those cartridges go for on eBay.
2561733	2563754	Yeah, I won't tell you how cheap we got ours.
2564354	2566275	Well, you might have got lucky too.
2566295	2568656	Did you find it at a... It was a long time ago.
2568836	2569056	Yeah.
2569857	2571978	Before the value... Probably when we had the video game store.
2572538	2572698	Hmm.
2574051	2576414	So anyway, this is out.
2576454	2578457	There was a special Nintendo Direct to go with it.
2578878	2585407	Some people taking surprise at the increased price because the game is $9.99 on the Wii U eShop.
2585447	2588491	It is not the normal, I'm using my quotey fingers, price of $7.99.
2589993	2594319	But to be honest, this isn't the first time we've seen a game priced higher than the bar.
2595461	2603672	I believe Mario 2 loss levels, or just Super Mario 2, the Japanese version, was a dollar more than most NES games.
2603692	2606916	Because on the Wii, they did this whole week of...
2607717	2608958	and import releases.
2609178	2612181	And, you know, Mario 2 is the big flagship of those, the original one.
2612602	2613763	And that was a dollar more.
2614143	2620669	The Final Fantasy games, I think, at least the Super Nintendo ones that they put out on Virtual Console, those were a dollar or maybe even two dollars more.
2620689	2621690	I think they were a dollar more.
2621710	2622991	Squeenix tax.
2623291	2623992	Yeah, basically.
2624052	2626034	Well, now this is, you know, Nintendo tax.
2626954	2627495	Both.
2628276	2630518	Well, so why are they charging the increased price?
2630558	2631959	Because they can, honestly.
2632459	2632720	I mean...
2635000	2637121	Gotta make up that GameStop exclusive money somewhere.
2637481	2638221	I guess so.
2638421	2658029	I mean, it's not like $9.99 is a ripoff, but they are talking about that there's an enhanced value about the Earthbound Strategy Guide, which is out there, and it's enhanced for the Wii U gamepad, and you can actually view it on Nintendo's Earthbound site, which, you know, you press the little home button, go into the browser, and you can open up on the site.
2658569	2659390	I'm gonna be honest...
2660470	2665352	I find that feature, and I'm using my quotey fingers, I find that feature to be a little bit disingenuous.
2665712	2671694	I don't think that's really a feature because you're just advertising a website, basically.
2672195	2679938	And to be honest, I could go, I could open up my internet browser and go to GameFacts.com and pull up almost anything that's on Virtual Console.
2680198	2680858	I mean, I can do that.
2681238	2687702	That's cool that Nintendo, you know, did the optimized, you know, and scanned it in and made that or whatever.
2687822	2691925	But you technically don't have to own Earthbound to see that.
2691945	2692866	You know what I mean?
2692886	2695848	That's not really value for buying the game.
2696368	2702172	So if you're going to tell me that the $2 was for that, I'm going to tell you that's a crock of shit.
2702792	2710938	Because that would be like me saying, oh, well, with every copy of Donkey Kong sold on the virtual console, you get a free vognetwork.com.
2711818	2736212	check it out it's not it doesn't quite work for me I mean cool yay it would be neat if Nintendo would do more manuals and stuff but you know what would be even better is if instead of having to press the home button having to press the internet browser button having to enter in earthbound.nintendo.com having to wait for the thing to load you know what would be even better than that
2736952	2737653	Thanks for watching!
2752913	2754994	Get online and speed some things up a little bit.
2756475	2758055	I guess this is a baby step.
2758156	2764358	Did you know with your copy of Balloon Flight that you can actually get a free copy of Pornhub?
2765439	2765919	Free porn.
2766499	2768080	With a Nintendo title.
2768120	2769081	I mean, that's ridiculous.
2770001	2771222	But it's optimized.
2772042	2778725	ShadowNextGen in chat at live.vognetwork.com says the guide from Nintendo would most likely be better than what you will find on GameFAQs.
2778745	2779525	No.
2779806	2779946	No.
2781059	2783262	I... Graphically, yes.
2783882	2786485	For the retro-minded in you, yes.
2786786	2791971	And, you know, again, for the whole, like, tickling your retro tastes or whatever, yes.
2792292	2794654	But GameFAQs will honestly be faster.
2794755	2796536	That site was slow as hell when I was playing with it.
2796557	2800601	It's probably outsourced anyway, so you're probably gonna get... It's probably gonna be a Prima guide or something.
2802103	2802283	But...
2803248	2803888	No, no, it wasn't.
2804308	2810410	Well, I mean, this was years ago, but every copy of Earthbound, when you bought it, it came in that bigger box.
2810530	2816091	I believe, I could be wrong, I believe it was a whole thing tied in to push Nintendo Power subscriptions.
2816591	2819392	Because remember how Nintendo Power would do those guides?
2819792	2821653	There was one for Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy.
2821673	2822813	Mario Paint.
2822833	2827274	I could be wrong, but I thought Earthbound was technically one of those guides.
2827794	2830995	And that there were things in there to try to get you to get a Nintendo Power subscription.
2832421	2833543	I had the Mario Paint one.
2833583	2834825	That was freaking sweet.
2834905	2836647	I'm having to think back almost 20 years here.
2837108	2837288	Anyhow.
2840031	2844432	Yeah, all sorts of pixel art in there for doing animated Yoshis and all sorts of fun stuff.
2845873	2848854	Alpha Cananogram says, The online US guide sucks.
2848914	2853495	The Nintendo Europe site has the PDF to download, and you put it on your iPad.
2853996	2856056	That's honestly how I've been doing a lot of playthroughs.
2856096	2860338	Not just Nintendo, but even 360 and PlayStation 3 as well.
2860418	2862318	I pull up the thing on my iPad.
2863099	2863659	Works great.
2864899	2869885	So, and BlackWolf says, it was a Nintendo guide, not a Prima guide.
2870245	2871627	Could have still been outsourced, though.
2871647	2875310	It doesn't necessarily, I mean, it could have, it didn't necessarily have to come in internally from Nintendo.
2875330	2876612	It could have, but, you know.
2878305	2880366	But they had the hotline, didn't they?
2881387	2883568	Oh, they still did at that time, yeah.
2883648	2885589	Oh yeah, the game counselors, absolutely.
2886990	2887250	Alright.
2889391	2896155	To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Thunder.
2897155	2898096	Moving on, DarkSakura.
2899133	2899533	Venture
2919342	2921163	Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, you brought that up on the show before.
2921443	2923063	I think I've done Venture as a classic.
2923303	2924104	If I haven't, I should.
2924284	2924724	I think you have.
2925504	2933307	Anyway, speaking of classic games, and this is, everybody has been messaging me this to show Dan, and Dan knows.
2933687	2934027	Trust me.
2934047	2934807	Of course Dan knows.
2934967	2936228	Of course Dan knows.
2936348	2938148	It's nice that people think of you, though.
2938368	2939489	Thank you, everybody.
2939569	2945491	But if there, keep in mind, Dan used to run a site called Neo Striders Strider Zone.
2946931	2951794	and it was one of two Strider sites that existed back in the days when people had websites on AOL.
2952214	2954976	He was probably sitting there all of a sudden the hair on his arm went up.
2954996	2956476	He's like, Strider news has been announced.
2956496	2966162	He turned red in the face and like all of a sudden weird signals came from his head where he started accepting the vibe of Strider as it flowed.
2966302	2966642	Did he cry?
2966682	2967422	Was there a little shaking?
2967462	2968043	I think he peed a little.
2968323	2968683	Deep breath.
2970376	2972837	Which I'm glad that he's not listening right now.
2972977	2974658	So, I love you, Dan.
2974738	2976379	What other embarrassing Dan stories do you want to tell?
2977200	2977740	Love you, mean it.
2977860	2981642	Well, I did say that I was going to clone his liver and sell multiple copies on eBay.
2981782	2985564	Because livers are worth the money, man.
2987405	2989626	I told him if he ever pissed me off, I'd punch him until he peed blood.
2991465	2992886	You make that thread of a lot of people, though.
2993066	2993507	I do.
2993527	2995228	You can't just throw that around willy-nilly.
2995789	2997470	I only do that to people I care about.
2998271	2998891	Rob, by the way.
3000333	3002294	Anyway, so yeah, I mentioned Strider.
3002475	3003175	It is Strider.
3003435	3011602	There is a version of Strider which is supposed to be a series reboot, from what I understand, like a redoing of the first game.
3012103	3015105	From what we could see of the trailer, it looked like the whole first level.
3015506	3018488	And it's being done by Double Helix, who is also working on Killer Instinct, so...
3019369	3023732	I don't know, this looks like it would be a lot better than that Killer Instinct thing, so I have some high hopes.
3025173	3031997	Watching the gameplay, it was really, really cool.
3032858	3037601	He doesn't so much walk as Dash everywhere he goes, he runs with purpose.
3038567	3040409	And now keep in mind, I loved Strider 2.
3040890	3042111	I loved the updated thing.
3042432	3046416	I loved every appearance of Strider, hear you, in Marvel vs. Capcom.
3047358	3050301	The various Marvel vs. Capcoms when he was playable.
3051563	3057610	And one of my favorite characters of all time, thanks to Dan making me sit down and said, any person I marry is going to beat Strider.
3059372	3064074	on Genesis, which I have, and finally beaten on arcade and beaten PlayStation version, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3064915	3067276	That last fight with the stupid master is a bitch.
3068277	3069257	It's a pain in the ass.
3069717	3077061	But anyway, so yeah, we both have a lot of happy going on in our house because of Strider.
3077241	3079002	Do you even love Strider on the NES?
3080103	3081804	I'm going to tell you about Strider on the NES.
3083104	3084105	It's based off the manga.
3085558	3087320	So it is not the arcade game.
3087560	3090723	It's got this one jump that's like freaking impossible.
3091204	3094487	I think we own the game and I think Dan kind of likes it.
3094547	3095868	The infamous triangle jump.
3096089	3097010	The triangle jump, yes.
3097630	3099932	I do like the story in the game.
3100133	3100953	I've read the manga.
3102195	3103156	I don't like playing it.
3104057	3109242	So I would much rather play the original Strider any day.
3110009	3112871	I loved Strider on the NES because I didn't have a Genesis.
3112911	3114392	We weren't really a Sega household.
3114432	3115313	We were all Nintendo.
3115373	3117754	So I played Strider on the NES.
3117774	3118435	I really liked it.
3118575	3123718	And hearing that this new game is kind of Metroidvania-ish made me think of the NES version.
3123758	3126280	Not that the NES was really Metroidvania, but it had the different stages.
3127341	3134826	The Nintendo Strider, I'm almost positive, was the same engine that DuckTales used because they were very similar where you would select a stage.
3135006	3136587	You would go to the various areas.
3136907	3137888	It was Capcom.
3137928	3138469	Yeah, I mean it was...
3139589	3140771	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3154765	3179410	I played Strider in the arcade a couple of times and it wasn't really my thing and I didn't play it on Nintendo but like I said Dan sat me down and said any woman I marry is going to play Strider so I've beaten Ghosts and Goblins 2 which made me want to cry tears of blood but Strider at least is a fun game and you know he actually told me a little bit of trivia about that too is that it was going to be a regular cartridge but because they wanted to put the Amazon level in it
3179730	3183611	They actually upped the memory in it so they can include the Amazon level and have the music and everything.
3183771	3183991	Nice.
3184351	3184531	Yeah.
3185371	3191393	So... So this news fills a certain hole in your heart that not even Moondiver could fill, right?
3192213	3192573	Yeah.
3192593	3194693	Moondiver was a good game.
3194813	3200755	I mean, it's a spiritual successor in the series, but we need to have Strider.
3201655	3202135	No one...
3202675	3217092	and what I'm kind of hoping is that with this we get some of the elements from Strider 2 like we see Hien you know because I actually I really like to play through the game with Hien that was really fun the guy who had two ciphers it was really cool but um
3218126	3219027	I have high hopes for this.
3219387	3220167	It looks pretty.
3220267	3222068	It looks like it plays solidly.
3223069	3225070	The backgrounds were amazing.
3225110	3226090	The music was amazing.
3226110	3229352	And it was the same first level that I heard.
3229452	3231994	So I will keep my fingers crossed.
3232014	3240698	A lot of people have been frowning a little bit hearing who's developing this because, you know, the new Killer Instinct game, which I don't know.
3240738	3243000	I mean, it's hard to judge a game that's not even out.
3243100	3243420	I don't know.
3244080	3268224	but Silent Hill Homecoming has a lot of people kind of nervous but you know I don't know if it's we really have to wait till the game's out I mean WayForward does a lot of great retro updates now dude they made Ping Pals if I remember right so that game was literally the worst handheld game in history so if you know this that company can do better after their first couple attempts I'm willing to give these guys a chance
3269421	3297346	and like I said I looked at the trailer and it really would be hard to screw up Strider unless there were major timing and physics issues other than that it really looked very solid and all they have to do is take the timing physics from the original and they would know exactly how to do it and like I said I've played other versions of Strider we actually have the PC Engine version which we can't play because we don't have the card for it, the arcade card but
3298246	3301188	That one even... I don't think it would be too hard.
3301228	3302248	I really don't think it would be too hard.
3302268	3306110	They'd have to really screw up, like I said, timing and physics to ruin the game.
3307010	3309532	Or, you know, maybe really shitty voice acting.
3310132	3310352	Which...
3311289	3316431	It can't get... Even the first game actually had pretty... The original had pretty decent voice acting in it.
3316871	3320332	It was all in whatever the native language of whoever the character was.
3320832	3322053	But it has the best line in it.
3322873	3323513	Ah, gotcha.
3324474	3324994	The one guy.
3325154	3327235	And the new one's like, I'm Strider!
3327315	3329115	I'm gonna hit you with my sword!
3329135	3331296	And he's like, hi, I hear you!
3332796	3333217	Wow.
3334897	3337078	They better give him the uber-bishy voice, you know?
3339012	3341514	I'm surprised they waited to announce this for Comic Con.
3341534	3344156	That they didn't bring this out at E3.
3344196	3345637	I mean, maybe it just wasn't ready.
3345917	3349740	It's one of the games that the fans have been dying to get a new game of.
3350600	3355424	Sorry Mega Man, you guys fucking suck.
3355664	3357545	Enjoy the Game Boy games on 3DS.
3357565	3359446	The Mega Man thing I think is Spite now.
3361648	3367112	But I'm actually a little bit more excited about Strider than I am about a Mega Man game, so.
3367755	3377260	I think a Mega Man project's in the works, but I think with this Strider news and so forth and Mega Man and Smash, I think there'll be something next year.
3377380	3379482	But, I mean, easy to say, right?
3380042	3382163	Any Strider analyst can say that.
3383063	3384164	All right, let's move on.
3384204	3384484	Loki.
3384504	3389087	It'll be really awesome as if they do a new Mega Man unit.
3389107	3391948	It's done by, was it WayForward, actually?
3392469	3393569	I think, you know.
3393629	3395110	There were comments to that in the chat room, too.
3396805	3398275	It'll suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.
3399403	3399846	They can't do it.
3400146	3401807	If the DuckTales thing goes well, you never know.
3402988	3403569	That looks cool.
3404109	3409093	Anyways, so NCAA, there was a bit of drama with that, considering that the game just came out.
3410394	3414197	Apparently, NCAA is not renewing its contract with EA.
3415338	3419262	This will be, I guess, the last year that it'll be called NCAA Football 14.
3420262	3425607	However, and I know they have a lawsuit against them, and this is from 2008, basically saying that...
3430130	3438474	I want to say it was because they've never licensed the use of current student athlete names, images, or likenesses.
3439074	3452140	So I think the whole reason that they're not renewing their contract with them is they're trying to distance themselves from EA because EA is kind of going around them and putting these students in the game.
3453961	3457382	and I guess EA is still going to be making college football games.
3457402	3463864	It'll just probably be called EA Sports College Football 15 next year or something like that.
3465645	3479990	And of course, you know, they're just saying that once again, even like some attorneys that are dealing with the whole lawsuit are saying, yeah, it's basically an announcement makes plain that NCAA is attempting to mitigate the damages of
3481110	3495818	They say that our suit illustrates the cabal between NCAA and EA has exploited student athletes for years using their images in video games without compensation.
3495958	3496719	Well, that sounds like EA.
3497319	3509267	While we are heartened that they've stopped the practice, we believe that they owe students or student-athletes a great deal more than implied promise to stop stealing their images.
3509687	3510848	So how's that going to work next year?
3510888	3514270	Are they actually going to stop using the student images?
3514310	3518733	So it's just going to be like generic people on a team type thing?
3518953	3521235	Are we going like EA Sports Tech Mobile here?
3521375	3523116	I mean, how's that going to work?
3523556	3524237	So I don't know.
3526485	3526845	Whatever.
3528246	3532708	And I even read in chat or something that they were saying that next year is going to be all next-gen anyways.
3533308	3534989	No current-gen version of the game.
3536230	3538971	Could be a chance to kind of reboot, reinvent things a little bit.
3538991	3542332	It would be interesting to see if 2K comes back with a college football game.
3543513	3550356	The last one, remember how they tried to do that whole American football or I forget what their one.
3550516	3554518	Had this weird lineup of people in there and stuff and fake teams and stuff.
3555199	3559866	and that didn't work out too well but it'd be kind of neat to see 2K come back and do you know
3560759	3564040	How important is it to have the actual people in the game?
3564360	3568962	I mean, I don't play a whole lot of sports games, but it's never really mattered to me for the games I've played.
3568982	3573184	Yeah, but for sports games, you want to play as your favorite players and stuff.
3574024	3578726	Which I realize the EA NCAA games didn't actually have the player.
3578806	3581327	Well, I mean, they were all there except in name.
3581387	3583148	I mean, that's what it was, right?
3583428	3585609	Their stats were what you would expect to see.
3585689	3588570	Their looks were what you would expect to see with subtle changes.
3589091	3589971	Just the names weren't there.
3590191	3602937	Yeah, I think it's just, they want, you know, they, just like, you know, if you were playing an NBA game, you'd want to have, you know, they pay those players to use their likenesses and stuff in the game.
3603397	3606259	So the thing is, why aren't they paying these college students?
3606359	3607719	Because they think they can get away with it.
3607960	3609180	Oh, what's a college student going to do?
3609320	3609901	Try to sue me?
3609981	3610941	Ha, you're broke.
3611261	3611982	I mean, seriously.
3613002	3614823	Well, they can't, they can't profit.
3615203	3617685	It's NCAA regulations that they can't do that.
3617785	3620486	Well, NCAA is saying that they never license that stuff to them.
3620506	3625870	They're basically saying, oh, well, we didn't do this, but they're still getting this stuff in the game anyway.
3626150	3627891	Well, Bobby in chat wants to clarify.
3628111	3631753	Bobby Blackwolf says, they only lost the NCAA name, nothing else.
3631793	3634175	The colleges and bowls and stadiums and stuff are still EA.
3634235	3637176	The only thing they lost is the NCAA name and the NCAA logo.
3637196	3637517	That's it.
3638317	3639458	Well, then that won't affect anything.
3640444	3640964	You don't think?
3641324	3641685	I don't think.
3642205	3643366	I don't think it'll be a big deal either.
3643626	3645447	I think at the end of the day, a good game is a good game.
3646027	3647608	Like, I love Tecmo Bowl.
3647648	3648969	It's like my favorite football game.
3649309	3650890	And it didn't really have any of that.
3650950	3653371	So, you know, anyhow.
3656781	3658322	Moving on.
3659123	3661645	Lots of gaming things being shown at Comic-Con.
3661685	3678099	Now, I know gaming kind of comes up every year at Comic-Con, but it definitely seems like there's more of it this year than we usually see, and that probably has something to do with the fact that we have new consoles coming this year, so obviously the companies want to push that to the potential buying audience, of which a lot of them are at Comic-Con right now, although I'm not there.
3679440	3679680	But...
3680601	3682602	Sony is at Comic Con with the PlayStation 4.
3682722	3688985	They have Knack and Drive Club out there open for play, letting the public experience PlayStation 4.
3689625	3692027	I think it would be a safe bet to say those games will show up.
3692167	3695788	Everything you're hearing here, these games will get in a truck and move to PAX in a couple weeks.
3695948	3696449	Absolutely.
3697829	3702291	Octodad, I guess, is part of PlayStation 4 as well.
3702692	3705873	Gran Turismo 6 is also there, even though technically that's not next-gen.
3705893	3706393	It's still there.
3706413	3707454	It still looks nice.
3707634	3714695	Yeah, Microsoft has Rise with the Y, Rise, and Killer Instinct out there on the floor.
3714736	3716576	Killer Instinct drawing pretty good crowds.
3716636	3717996	It's apparently Rise is too.
3719136	3727658	Apparently other games being shown out there, Dead Rising 3, Assassin's Creed 4, and Watch Dogs all there at Comic-Con.
3727678	3728458	That's just a taste.
3728498	3731619	That's just some of the stuff that involves next-gen and the big companies.
3732059	3735980	So is there any comics to be found at Comic-Con out of curiosity?
3736620	3737681	Marvel's got a whole big thing.
3738221	3738942	No, I know.
3739102	3741284	Well, you know, they actually did announce the next Avengers movie.
3741824	3742624	Yeah, but that's a movie.
3742645	3743245	It's not a comic.
3743505	3744886	Yeah, but it's still Marvel.
3745066	3747168	And why are they fucking going with Age of Ultron?
3747708	3747848	Ugh!
3748328	3748549	Sorry.
3748789	3749249	Not a fan?
3749910	3750830	I'm not a fan of Ultron.
3750970	3752571	And they're doing the same thing in the comics.
3753332	3754393	They tease Thanos.
3755290	3764915	So here I go talking about movies on the Video Game Podcast, but I went to go see This is the End last night, which was funny.
3765155	3767376	It was one of those movies that was so stupid.
3768417	3773960	It's seriously stupid, but to the point where it's actually really funny.
3774060	3777202	It's so stupid you can't help but laugh, like a lot of stoner comedies are.
3777222	3777842	It was great.
3778122	3779143	Yeah, I had a good time.
3779183	3779523	It was good.
3779823	3782505	But I got home, and the first news that greets me when I get home,
3783385	3787587	The Superman sequel will have Batman in it.
3788508	3793470	They're doing the Superman versus Batman thing that was in one of the... I'm just like, stop.
3793491	3793671	No.
3794111	3794831	Stop.
3795291	3803836	And I know this is a whole to build up to the Justice League movie that they have to do because Marvel's got the Avengers, so now DC's got to do this.
3804136	3804977	But it's like, no.
3805837	3806057	No.
3806498	3812281	You do not get to do a Justice League movie until you fucking do a Wonder Woman movie.
3813101	3839566	you don't get to debut her no she needs her own movie and it needs to be good because if it sucks you don't get to do a Justice League movie and I don't I god the whole idea of Batman and Superman is just I don't I don't like that I don't know like I get that it's based on a comic and it was a real thing and everything but I don't know maybe there's just that part of me that holds out hope for a fourth bail Batman movie which I realize they probably couldn't do because of the story and everything but damn it there's always a way
3841107	3856322	I want to see a sequel to Suburban Commando but instead of having Hulk Hogan in the movie it'll be Christian Bale Batman and he'll be like going around the neighborhood driving a car just a regular car not the Batmobile just like growling at people you know that'd be fun maybe babysitting some kids
3859794	3865395	There's some Marvel vs. DC chat going on in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com And all the Marvel people are right.
3866176	3869617	Brad from PodCulture says, You should ask if any good comics are there.
3869677	3870497	Who reads Marvel?
3871478	3872238	People with taste.
3873098	3873478	Snap.
3874219	3876920	Slidekick says, I've always preferred Marvel for superheroes.
3877340	3878300	People, please.
3878580	3880901	There's good and bad on both sides.
3881041	3882461	There's good and bad on both sides.
3882481	3883642	Yes, check out Rocket Raccoon.
3884975	3886215	It's all about image anyways.
3908278	3916680	You heard at Comic-Con, I don't know if there was a panel or something with David Coveney and the whole X-Files crew and stuff, but he wants to bring that back.
3917100	3920021	I'm like, yes, please, that would be fantastic.
3920101	3926503	I still haven't seen the second movie, which I hear is really dumb, but I would love to have them just bring it back.
3926543	3928484	I mean, they're both not really fucking doing anything.
3929344	3932024	Just bring back a whole new series and set it 20 years later and...
3934065	3937087	Pick up from where it left off.
3937468	3938328	It'd be fantastic.
3942912	3943392	All right.
3944813	3946254	Let's move on with more news.
3946674	3950617	Classic Game of the Week, still a little bit away, and release dates coming up right after this.
3951098	3951538	DarkSakura.
3953099	3954120	Ready to friend some butts?
3956109	3956389	What?
3956869	3958250	I explained that to Dan, by the way.
3958390	3959850	He's like, you guys are weird.
3960610	3966231	So Nintendo has trademarked two game names that will really do hint to Seaman.
3968772	3977754	They have the rights to Mysterious Pet, Legend of the Fish with a Human Face, and Mysterious Partner, Legend of the Fish with a Human Face.
3978815	3982636	And it was registered in Japan.
3982796	3983156	It was...
3984776	3997542	Now, there have been some goings-on with the creator of Seaman, who is Yut Saito, who did work with Nintendo for GameCube content.
3997582	4002665	That was a pinball game, Odama, and the Guild 101 thing...
4006280	4006720	AeroPorter.
4007381	4010703	So it could be possible that we may be seeing another Seaman.
4011263	4015705	They'd have to put out a micro... Well, I guess the microphone's already built into the controller, so who knows?
4016326	4023250	On both the 3DS and on the... Well, 3DS DS and Wii U. Wii U friend as butt.
4024130	4024970	Well, not friend as butt.
4025091	4029513	And actually, it doesn't sound very exciting, but... Sure, why not?
4030974	4031134	Hmm.
4031154	4031214	Hmm.
4032188	4035271	I think that buttfriending should be a thing.
4036412	4037213	Click to buttfriend.
4037514	4041518	I think there's a lot of people that don't get that joke, and I'm trying to find that original YouTube.
4042138	4043960	Yeah, that was a while back.
4044421	4045061	Was it a Let's Play?
4045121	4046002	It was a long time ago.
4046082	4049045	Some dude doing a Let's Play with that game, Seaman.
4049686	4054291	Yeah, I think it was like Seaman Gameplay or Yeah, Let's Play.
4056255	4058197	I'm assuming Tigerclaw could probably find it.
4058377	4059939	Yeah, Tigerclaw, do your job.
4060099	4060859	Find us the link.
4062241	4062681	Hopefully.
4062841	4063882	Friend his butt for us.
4064102	4065484	Let me Tigerclaw that for you.
4067345	4072050	It was like asking about birthdays and it was like, are we friends?
4072490	4073351	I'll friend your butt.
4076614	4077875	Wait, wait, I might have found it.
4078015	4079296	I might have beat Tigerclaw to this.
4080698	4081038	That's it.
4083632	4085133	So, what month is your birthday in?
4085153	4086273	October You were born in October?
4086293	4090515	No it doesn't Let's try that again In what month were you born?
4090595	4090855	October
4113922	4115503	You were born in October?
4115863	4116164	Yes.
4117825	4121828	I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat?
4123309	4123629	Treat.
4125711	4126852	Like the spice?
4128653	4128933	Yes.
4130955	4133817	Well, you can look, but don't touch.
4135378	4136319	I don't want to touch you.
4139941	4140762	What do you want?
4141723	4142243	To touch you.
4144133	4145494	I don't know that word.
4146554	4147335	You just said it.
4147395	4150877	So, what day is your birthday on?
4152257	4152617	Second.
4154058	4154819	The second?
4155519	4156139	Yes, bitch.
4157840	4161262	Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.
4161642	4165044	This honestly sounds like me talking to Siri.
4165644	4167545	I hope you are as peaceful as he.
4168566	4173128	I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.
4175342	4175802	Fuck you.
4178003	4184384	Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know.
4185705	4187685	Besides, what would the neighbors think?
4188545	4189045	Fuck them.
4191946	4192626	Fuck them!
4194287	4195867	Hey, why all the noise?
4197868	4198328	Your mama.
4200648	4201008	What?
4201769	4202769	Your mama.
4205174	4205514	Mama.
4207616	4209036	Nope, I'm just fine.
4210097	4210357	Wait.
4212518	4213779	Sorry, I'm busy.
4214440	4215400	You don't look busy.
4216461	4222565	I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.
4223605	4227267	I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?
4227307	4229209	Just don't get any ideas about me.
4230149	4231490	Let's just be friends.
4232451	4233031	For now.
4236348	4237229	I'll friend your butt.
4239291	4240672	Are you coming on to me?
4240692	4241413	Yes.
4241433	4243475	There, there it is.
4243495	4246918	I like how it floats closer to the... Two minutes and 30 seconds later.
4247098	4249821	Again, credit to YouTube user EbolaWorld for that.
4249881	4251322	Totally just stole that there.
4251342	4254485	But that's where that joke comes from, the whole I'll friend your butt thing, which is great.
4254865	4258169	So lots of Let's Plays, I'm sure, coming.
4258429	4261712	If this happens to be true, which I kind of hope it is, that would be great.
4263046	4267947	We actually did play the game to completion and set our little frogman free.
4269068	4271408	And then Dan's like, I wonder if he's still there.
4274309	4275569	We still have our save files intact.
4277550	4277790	Nice.
4278650	4285872	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming out a lot sooner than any Seaman reboot.
4287567	4293493	We could definitely use a Seaman reboot this week because all we have is the Smurfs 2.
4293573	4296036	The official game.
4296056	4297177	Electric Boogaloo.
4297517	4298898	Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
4298938	4302362	Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.
4302442	4303323	You said Wii Wii.
4304944	4308087	I said Wii Wii U. Wii Wii U.
4310666	4312167	Alright, then I guess we travel to Japan.
4312367	4312988	That was quick.
4313548	4314929	Looking at some of the release dates in Japan.
4314989	4318011	On the PlayStation 3 this week, quite a bit actually.
4318111	4323395	Dragon's Crown, Ketsui, Kizuna, Jigoku Tachi Extra in regular and limited edition.
4323936	4327358	Majo Tohai Kihei comes out as well in regular and limited.
4328119	4331681	Also, Race Driver Grid 2 and X-Blade Code Embryo.
4331981	4336064	And Zone of the Enders HD Edition gets a price reduction this week.
4336465	4336605	So...
4337625	4340007	Lots and lots of releases there.
4340247	4350453	Also going to on the Xbox 360, I don't think there's really anything on the 360.
4350833	4352134	I mean, what did you expect?
4353375	4355476	Also looking at the PlayStation Vita.
4359145	4368599	Dragon's Crown, X-Blaze Code Embryo, Next Rev Iken, Dragon's Crown Famitsu Pack
4373341	4397087	and looking at the let's see on the Wii U the Wii U does have Lego City undercover getting its Japanese release this week and also a new gamepad battery pack which I think was reported on a couple weeks ago that is actually getting its release in Japan this week as far as peripherals go going to the 3DS Gaikuten Saiban 5 is finally released from Capcom and
4397508	4404761	and that is the Phoenix Wright game basically Ace Attorney that's the one with Apollo and all the folks in it is that the one that's rated M?
4405102	4407126	I think I heard I don't think so
4407952	4409073	for its release over here.
4409973	4414817	Well, anyway, that is out in Japan this week, and there's a whole lot of peripherals to come with that.
4415237	4419680	Fantasy Life Link and Chibi Devil 2, Mahou no Yume Ihon.
4419940	4420200	Toh.
4421721	4422982	And... Is that... No.
4423683	4424643	It was no, not toh.
4424783	4425684	Toh, oh.
4425784	4432048	Beast Saga Saikyou Gekutosu Coliseum comes out on the 3DS this week.
4432088	4432869	It's a busy week in Japan.
4432889	4433469	That's interesting.
4434129	4434290	Why?
4434490	4434690	Hmm.
4435330	4437672	No, I've seen that before somewhere, but I don't know.
4440524	4444907	And lastly, yes, there are still PCP, or PCP, PSP games coming.
4445727	4448769	Daya no Kuni no Alice, Wonderful Mirror World.
4449330	4451931	I wonder if that's based off like Alice in Wonderland type of game.
4452212	4453833	I'm sure it is, or Through the Looking Glass.
4453953	4455914	Like an anime, oh yeah, see, look.
4456454	4459897	The Mad Hatter is a sexy... That's the March Hare.
4460077	4461798	Well, the Mad Hatter's right behind him.
4463059	4466421	They're all sexy, like, you know, anime style.
4467121	4487493	and Toki no Keizuna Hanamatsubi to Zuri comes out in regular and limited edition and there's a twin pack as well lots of games not so many for the UK on the 22nd we have RuneScape 3 for PC on the 25th I have no idea how this is supposed to say rimmed capsule is that it?
4487733	4495798	rimmed capsule on iPad, Android, and iPhone Shadowrun returns for iPad, Android, Mac, and PC and on the 26th we have Pikmin 3 for Wii U
4497682	4498002	It's over.
4511488	4529494	A lot of people would say that the Xbox One might be a little rushed or even some of these next-gen systems, but there was some news that came out regarding Forza Motorsports 5 saying that the game was going to require a one-time download before it can be played.
4530354	4542059	and that they were basically at such a crunch for time that they were putting the framework of the game together.
4542199	4549102	They're getting that pressed to disk and then they were going to be working on the tracks up until launch.
4550746	4562129	and so basically you would buy the game and then you'd have to download the rest um you know when you first put the game in the system so you would need to be connected to the internet now
4564167	4566168	Of course, there's been some back and forth about it.
4566288	4579074	They said, I guess Turn 10's Dan Greenwald, he changed his statement saying that the requirement of a connection to Xbox Live before playing is not the plan.
4579974	4585756	However, when or if the game requires an internet connection for single player content, it's still not clear.
4586417	4586677	So...
4590333	4591354	Thanks for watching!
4608473	4615239	When you get to the point where the game is literally not done, it is admitted to be, it is not done.
4615680	4616700	The game is not done.
4617041	4627310	And now they need to put it on a disc so that you download the rest of the content later because they want to hit that launch window or whatever.
4627971	4628931	That's ridiculous.
4629692	4631033	That is absolutely ridiculous.
4631113	4632555	And I'm sorry, I just...
4634356	4635277	What's the point?
4635297	4636238	I just don't understand.
4661098	4676067	that really sucks for those people that don't have the internet connection which was a big part of the push to get Xbox One to reverse their policies to begin with and it's not even the internet connection thing let's just skip the whole like people that don't have internet okay because a lot of people do have internet
4677054	4680857	It's still going to take a long time to download the rest of the content for that game.
4680977	4688383	I mean, you know DLC and stuff that includes actual new art assets and stuff for at least a few hundred meg.
4688643	4702134	And when you're talking that, you know, let's just assume that the majority of the tracks are on the game, you're talking like a multi-gig download that even on somewhat decent bandwidth or whatever...
4705376	4708817	That's going to take at least an hour to download.
4708977	4711438	Are you going to really want to have to deal with that bullshit?
4712158	4718160	That you have to download a big portion of the game in the first place to be able to even play the single player campaign?
4718360	4720881	I think that's just kind of ridiculous that they even would do that.
4722751	4723131	I don't know.
4724531	4731613	And is this something that says, okay, yeah, we're going to have this extra content that we're building up to launch.
4731873	4737435	Does that mean that later on after it launches that they're going to put all that content onto the disc later on?
4737755	4741376	Are they going to do that or are they just going to say, ah, fuck it, whatever?
4744555	4749758	I think this is too much of the letting the day one patch fix your problems.
4749778	4753380	Dude, if this game isn't ready at launch, then don't launch it with it.
4753720	4754921	Launch it a couple weeks later.
4755101	4757442	It's fine, because you're already going to have games coming out.
4757822	4759543	So what if it doesn't come out day one?
4760143	4760544	That's okay.
4760564	4764306	It's sometimes good to have things a little later, too.
4764606	4765866	The Wii U could have used that.
4766187	4770949	Infamous isn't coming out day one and stuff, and I just don't understand why they wouldn't push it.
4771855	4778037	I want to say that a lot of release dates for games have to do with money and advertising.
4779298	4783159	With advertising, with deals with distributors.
4783799	4785460	I really think that that's where a lot of it comes into.
4785500	4792062	So they set this date that may or may not be realistic and don't want to violate that date.
4792122	4795943	So they go ahead and ship and keep working on it so that they have the patches ready.
4796424	4797604	That's my thought on why they do that.
4797704	4800445	But I would personally prefer them to wait.
4801246	4802188	I can just shift the date of it.
4802789	4809180	I understand, yeah, that people plan ahead for advertising, but they're planning holiday advertisements and stuff.
4810322	4812165	It's a little closer than now.
4812305	4812846	I mean, now is...
4814676	4815437	Thanks for watching!
4833759	4838041	That's a big problem if you know that you're not going to hit your launch and you're already how many months out?
4839001	4839541	Just push it.
4839621	4841542	Just push the game if it's not going to be ready.
4841822	4843983	Now the question is, are other games going to be like this?
4844083	4846083	Are we going to see the same thing with Rise?
4846143	4849564	Because they've rushed the launch for this system.
4849624	4852245	Hasn't Rise been worked on for quite some time now?
4852365	4852985	It doesn't matter.
4853106	4853566	I don't care.
4853626	4857907	I mean, there's been games that have shipped incomplete before.
4858127	4860628	So I'm just not... I don't know.
4861368	4863189	It's disheartening, I guess.
4864029	4865030	But, you know, whatever.
4865070	4866530	They're not going to tell anybody about it.
4867711	4868531	Well, I guess they did.
4868551	4869171	That's kind of weird.
4869591	4871232	They probably won't tell the general public about it.
4871932	4875834	It won't be on the box saying, hey, you need to connect to the internet to play this.
4876034	4876834	It's all incentives.
4877234	4881576	Alright, well here's a game I'm sure they will have no problem delaying until it's damn near perfect.
4881656	4884297	Although, I mean, sometimes this game gets bugs too.
4885017	4888078	There was a pretty infamous one on the Wii release of Zelda.
4888659	4889459	And, come on.
4889719	4891121	Zeldagame on the Wii U
4905178	4907420	So it's like, yes, it's coming, but...
4930666	4931467	It'd be awesome.
4931627	4932307	Yes, it's coming.
4932548	4935470	And the demo is on the Wind Waker HD disc.
4935490	4938072	That would be awesome, but probably not happening.
4940254	4951743	But anyway, what I really wanted to talk about was an interview with Aonuma who was talking about the tired formula of traditional Zelda games.
4951823	4953264	I might be kind of...
4954605	4955326	I'm tired.
4977182	4977942	Thank you for watching!
5000814	5001074	All right.
5001395	5005238	Despite the whole fact that he says he's getting tired of it, I wouldn't read too much into that.
5005378	5014666	I just would think that the next game is going to probably not necessarily be quite like Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess and all that.
5015106	5016147	It might have some differences.
5016207	5017428	But we've already heard about that.
5017889	5024154	I remember a story about three, four months ago that Skyrim was influencing Zelda as well a little bit.
5025115	5026136	Maybe something more open world?
5026996	5038883	I would, well, I mean, Zelda kind of already is pretty open world, the more recent ones, but I mean, maybe a little less, I mean, the dungeons could be fluid, but it isn't even like that in Skyrim.
5039123	5044466	I mean, you go through a transition from open world to... I used to be an adventurer, but I took a hookshot to the knee.
5045947	5046407	Shut up.
5048642	5048682	So...
5075767	5079371	Slidekick is in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and says, that's great news.
5079752	5084897	I love Zelda, but Skyward Sword was a step forward in the right direction and they need to continue to experiment with it.
5085718	5087260	So, there you go.
5088041	5090263	Hopefully we'll get more info on this soon.
5091244	5095425	But in the meantime, let's go back to a more classic era of video games.
5095945	5096986	I was really short.
5097166	5102968	Let's go to when Zelda 2 was completely breaking the formula and some people hated it for that.
5102988	5103408	No, no, no.
5103508	5104888	Let's go earlier than that.
5104928	5106629	Let's go even earlier than that.
5106829	5108769	Let's go to me being six years old.
5109250	5110250	Oh my God.
5110350	5113311	Is this a game that was on like...
5114406	5116629	I had to stand on a step stool to play it.
5117811	5118532	Was it Pong?
5118853	5119173	No.
5119814	5120375	Not that old.
5120415	5121436	Was it Space War?
5121677	5121957	No.
5122618	5123099	Girl, please.
5123559	5125342	Alright, it's the classic game of the week.
5125362	5130209	DarkSakura's gonna jump into her gaming vault and pull a game out of her butt that she framed.
5131738	5133259	No, it's Kangaroo.
5133279	5135600	I'm gonna jump right into it.
5135720	5136220	Ha ha.
5136660	5141623	It was done by Sun Electronics, distributed by Atari.
5142764	5146225	And it's sort of like a cross between Donkey Kong and Popeye.
5146986	5150828	You basically play a mother kangaroo who has to rescue her baby, her little Joey.
5151288	5154930	You go through the treetops and beat up monkeys.
5155570	5157431	I was not aware that there were monkeys in Australia.
5157571	5158592	Are there monkeys in Australia?
5158992	5160032	There's kangaroos in Australia.
5160673	5161373	But why are there monkeys?
5163479	5165190	They run the other direction.
5165472	5165673	Okay.
5167341	5171503	My thought is that they're really criminals because you know that's how Australia was started.
5171523	5174765	Yes, and I know the Australians love it when you point that out, DarkSakura.
5176366	5177766	I think that they're pink criminals.
5178227	5179287	So I'm going to go with that.
5179327	5180228	That's my headcanon.
5180288	5181628	You cannot convince me otherwise.
5182129	5193535	So you can punch apples and throw them at... They throw apples at you and you can punch them and you can knock down the monkeys with it.
5193755	5193935	So...
5194415	5198438	Basically, you go up ladders through trees to rescue your baby kangaroo.
5199318	5207864	There are four different levels, and basically, like I said, you rescue the joey, and you get apples thrown at you, and you get to beat up the mean monkeys.
5208204	5213248	You can punch them with your boxing gloves, and you can punch the apples, and you can punch other fruit.
5213288	5214528	You just go around punching shit.
5215629	5220292	And then you have to be, um, watch out for the big ape who tries to take your gloves away.
5220332	5222333	You can't punch him if you don't have boxing gloves.
5222833	5225535	But I would just think that a kangaroo could kick him in the face.
5226175	5229157	Because I imagine that being kicked by a kangaroo would really freaking hurt.
5230663	5250511	So, the third level is a different one, because the baby kangaroo is actually being held up by monkeys, and you get apples that basically get sent up on you for when you climb up there, so you have to punch the monkey several times until the cage is open.
5251631	5252212	Punch the monkey.
5253718	5254258	Thanks for watching!
5268759	5293612	and you have Westminster Quarters where the bell plays too and Marcia alla Turca which was well music inspired by that by Beethoven so anyway it came out on the Atari 2600 and the 5200 which I have both copies of the 5200 version is super good never play it with a trackball by the way because you will want to shoot yourself in the face
5295177	5301161	Now, Kangaroo was actually involved with the Saturday Supercade.
5301181	5301902	Do you remember that, Rob?
5302682	5303222	I actually do.
5304083	5303222	1984.
5304743	5308526	Kangaroo and Space Ace replaced Pitfall Harry, Frogger, and Donkey Kong Jr.
5308586	5309667	for segments on that show.
5310607	5324897	And so basically, the kangaroos were Katie and Joey, and they lived in a zoo run by Mr. Friendly, and they were friends with Sidney the Squirrel, and they had to fight the Monkey Biz gang.
5326558	5327978	Which you know who... Oh, that's actually cool.
5327998	5328398	I didn't know that.
5328458	5330699	One of the voices for one of the monkeys was Frank Welker.
5331620	5333201	They were Bingo, Bango, Bongo, and Fred.
5334641	5335842	You can actually get this on DVD?
5335882	5336462	That's kind of cool.
5336482	5338083	I need to go get those on DVD.
5338563	5339563	So yeah, Kangaroo.
5340544	5341064	Fun game.
5342925	5345106	Now, here's my background story on this one.
5346226	5347087	Imagine 1982.
5348827	5349648	Six years old.
5350068	5352049	I'm in first grade.
5352969	5354250	At Godfather's Pizza.
5357357	5361338	Neeling on this weird stool trying to play freaking kangaroo.
5362898	5367359	And I kept running back for quarters because I was bound and determined to punch those damn monkeys.
5368499	5369720	And I punched some monkeys.
5372480	5374141	Tell us more about how you punch the monkeys.
5375081	5376221	I punch monkeys all the time.
5376241	5380482	So they give a throwing poo and yanking it in the zoo.
5381502	5383743	Monkeys are nasty little bastards.
5385680	5386541	I love monkeys.
5386601	5387161	I love lemurs.
5389442	5391723	If someone said, do you want a monkey or a lemur?
5391883	5392824	I pick a lemur every time.
5394124	5394645	Or a kangaroo.
5395645	5398667	I don't know what the hell that has to do with the game, but that's so funny.
5398687	5399067	Monkeys!
5399687	5400288	Punching monkeys.
5400468	5401028	There it is.
5401528	5404310	The punching monkey classic, Kangaroo.
5405470	5407071	Available in arcades everywhere.
5407371	5408152	Punching monkeys.
5409352	5411093	Look for it where you can punch your favorite monkeys.
5411113	5413434	Tiger Claw posted up the intro to the kangaroo cartoon.
5414375	5414735	There you go.
5415495	5416135	But you know what?
5416295	5417856	Nothing is as awesome as punching a monkey.
5419517	5420798	I stand by my monkey punching.
5421158	5423379	There's your classic game of the week.
5423419	5424460	At least I didn't say donkey.
5424820	5427301	I was waiting the whole time for you to make a donkey punch.
5428361	5428662	Anyhow.
5428922	5430563	I wasn't going to say it, but I did anyway.
5430883	5435285	Let's take a break, and DarkSakura's got to go punch a monkey or two.
5435305	5437326	When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
5437586	5438326	Do you have monkeys?
5438547	5440828	Lots of responses to the Fugo question of the week.
5440928	5442328	No, just a cat, and you can't punch her.
5442389	5442949	She doesn't like that.
5443569	5445170	I will punch her by petting her.
5445699	5447242	and the mailbag, maybe.
5447342	5447582	I don't know.
5447603	5449246	There were no emails in there this morning when I looked.
5449286	5449627	Good.
5449687	5451010	I mean, aw.
5451250	5455759	And your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.
5455840	5456301	Stay tuned.
5456581	5456862	Okay.
5463766	5472548	Hi there, this is Captain Spike and First Mate Slagkick from GameBooey.org GameBooey.org And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5472608	5478829	And we want to use our voice to tell you support indie broadcasting and congratulations to Orange Lounge Radio on 11 wonderful years.
5478969	5479829	Congratulations.
5479849	5480829	Congratulations.
5481169	5482549	Congratulations.
5482969	5485050	Is my mic off?
5485110	5485390	Hi.
5487490	5490411	Thanks to our friends at GameBooey.org for that bumper.
5490911	5491671	Appreciate it.
5493248	5499372	Sometimes I wish we did a tape show like they did so that way I could cover up all those screw-ups when they happen like I don't have my mic on.
5501633	5503134	That's the second time you've heard that bumper.
5503194	5507977	That's because we're not getting any more bumpers from our listeners.
5508197	5509078	Shame on all of you.
5509278	5510899	So you should definitely send us some.
5511659	5517623	Check the forums over at vognetwork.com and you can send us a bumper and you can tell us whatever you want.
5517703	5520685	Use your voice here on the program to tell us whatever you want.
5521125	5525228	We have a lot of people giving their voices to the Fugle Question of the Week here in a little bit.
5525288	5526289	But we'll play that.
5527169	5528790	We'll get to that in a little bit here.
5528870	5532133	But first, we have some rapid-fire news we've got to go over.
5533073	5533974	Loki.
5534774	5535155	All right.
5535595	5541759	Let's talk a little bit about the awesome game that is Saints Row 4.
5542440	5548684	And there is some wonderful news that came out from a panel at Comic-Con, actually.
5549204	5565499	and they were talking a little bit about some of the scrapped ideas that they had originally the end of the game was going to have a Bollywood dance number which that's awesome outstanding the only problem was it wasn't possible for them to do that because of the cost
5566499	5585391	by the time they figured out which Bollywood song to license and also doing all the choreography and stuff like that and the motion capture it was just going to be too much so they just couldn't end up doing that although I'm sure the ending of the game is going to be awesome
5585931	5588913	Apparently, though, they said that there's some really interesting details in the game.
5588933	5594195	They're kind of calling it, they're joking that the Saints Rose about the arts.
5594615	5611324	And I guess they have one of the in-game radio stations where the evil alien guy, Zinyak, he's actually reading a bunch of different classical literature, including monologues from Shakespeare and even the entire first chapter of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
5613163	5615805	Spoiler alert, I will not be listening to that station.
5616285	5620888	I'll be listening to the dubstep dance electronica station, as I always do.
5621269	5626952	And probably flipping between that and the 80s station, because I hear the 80s station is pretty awesome.
5626992	5629454	Will you listen to your dubstep while you use your dubstep gun?
5629474	5630114	No.
5630235	5632736	And chew your dubstep gum?
5633036	5635458	Assuming that I can fire that out the window, yes.
5636098	5637079	Most likely, no.
5638700	5638980	Amazing.
5639000	5639721	I can't believe this.
5640697	5641278	I can't wait.
5641658	5642899	It's not much longer now, right?
5642939	5643760	Yeah, yeah.
5643900	5645141	We're getting to that point of the year.
5645201	5645962	It's getting closer.
5646982	5647563	What is today?
5647663	5650625	July 21st.
5650766	5655810	We're like five weeks away from Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, just saying.
5656069	5658051	That's going to be a tight schedule, so that's all good.
5659553	5661735	All right, so I guess here's a positive.
5662015	5673367	Xbox One is also going to support partial download support, or I should say partial download play, meaning that while a game is being downloaded, you will be able to play the game thanks to the cloud.
5676909	5677850	When the cloud works.
5677950	5678590	When the cloud works.
5679551	5686576	Final Fantasy 7 is in the indication, though granted the servers are not even run by the same company, but I'm just saying.
5686996	5692120	Perhaps you have to level up Cloud so that he has his limit break, and limit break is cloud saving.
5692320	5693541	No, you get the limit break at level 1.
5693701	5695362	You get to use limit breaks at the beginning of the game.
5695822	5696343	Where have you been?
5697629	5700070	Alright, let's try to limit break.
5700090	5701991	Uh-oh, troll comment in our chatroom.
5702632	5705313	Not really, but live.vognetwork.com, I'm going to read it anyway.
5705734	5710476	MaskedBishop in our chatroom says, I'm still trying to figure out the selling point of the Saints Row series.
5711056	5711377	Loki?
5712557	5713878	It depends which one you're talking about.
5713898	5716119	The original Saints Row games were kind of like a Grand Theft Auto.
5717040	5722743	In fact, Saints Row 1 for me was, hey, Grand Theft Auto is on the Xbox 360, I'm going to play this game, and it was fun.
5723563	5729125	I think kind of the last few games it's just been so over the top and ridiculous that it's entertaining.
5729985	5735968	And Bobby is informing me, yes, you can listen to the radio anytime because it's cyberspace and the radio stations are injected directly into your brain.
5736388	5736648	Awesome.
5736668	5741109	So yes, you can listen to the dubstep while firing a dubstep gun.
5741129	5741690	Hooray.
5741990	5743110	Well, let me say this.
5743570	5745111	In my experience with at least Saints Row 3...
5745911	5764084	Saint's Row is good for the same reason that This Is The End was good it's fucking ridiculous and dumb as hell but you can't help but laugh like it's just over the top stupid it's beyond over the top yeah like and some of the things in that movie were just ridiculous but I laughed like it was so funny
5764344	5765305	It's not true.
5765405	5770809	Grand Theft Auto is trying to take itself kind of like an Oscar movie, I guess, where it's very well done.
5771109	5773351	Grand Theft Auto is a little ridiculous in itself.
5773451	5784120	It is a little ridiculous, but they're definitely going along the lines of realism, like the amount of detail that they have in the game with the whole stock markets and just all the stuff you can do in the game.
5785821	5790665	They're going one way with Grand Theft Auto, whereas Saints Row is kind of going the complete opposite direction.
5790725	5793307	They're just like, hey, you know what would be fun is if we have superpowers.
5793427	5794107	Are we going to explain it?
5794327	5794827	Eh, whatever.
5794847	5796168	He's in the Matrix now.
5796228	5797088	Okay, they're done.
5797188	5797788	Okay, sweet.
5798909	5800629	Hey, we were going to have a gun that fires dubstep.
5801949	5802329	Whatever.
5802590	5803330	It's just ridiculous.
5803390	5804370	It's supposed to be ridiculous.
5805990	5806951	And that's the whole point.
5806991	5810112	I mean, if that's the type of game you want to play, then play Saints Row.
5810292	5812832	I honestly think you should play both because they're both awesome.
5813573	5815393	I will be playing both a lot.
5816833	5818474	So much so that I'm probably not going to get PlayStation 4 now.
5820848	5834547	BlackWolf and TimTrip are having a conversation in our chatroom about it and BlackWolf says Tim, Saints Row 4 is basically Grand Theft Auto meets Crackdown meets over-the-top humor especially with their version of the Crackdown orbs Oh, Alan's here to give comment Hi Alan
5835250	5849201	Hello, just want to say, because I beat Grand Theft Auto 4 all the way through just a couple weeks ago, after the insanity of GTA 3 San Andreas, which there was a lot of crazy stuff in that, a lot of people thought that 4 proper with Nico Bellic was too dry.
5849221	5852063	It's very bleak and just super serious.
5852083	5854425	Well, did you play through the ballad of Gay Tony?
5854850	5857932	No, I'm only, like, an hour into Lost and Damned.
5857992	5862174	Okay, yeah, when you get to Valley of Daytona, it's kind of like they're trying to bring it back towards San Andreas.
5862614	5867097	And I think, honestly, that was, like, the best as far as, like, playing with the weapon set and stuff like that.
5867177	5867677	It was the best.
5867757	5878003	And then I guess you can tell already from the gameplay trailer for 5 that they realize that they don't want to turn the dial up to Saints Row crazy, but they need to have more over-the-top...
5878923	5880104	Stuff in it, I think.
5880124	5884105	They're just giving you more freedom without going crazy with the stuff that's in there.
5884145	5885526	In San Andreas, wasn't there like a big wheel?
5885826	5887586	Like it wasn't mod, you could just drive a big wheel around?
5889547	5890487	I don't remember.
5890788	5891308	It's been a while.
5891348	5896750	You could like parachute off buildings, a lot of crazy stuff, and then 4 was very, very bleak.
5899236	5903217	Captain Spike in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Eh, I want games to be fun.
5903578	5904218	Games and all.
5904318	5906518	Not really here for Grand Theft Auto's fourth story.
5906578	5908879	Wants to be an Oscar-winning movie bullshit or whatever.
5908939	5909519	It was fun.
5909599	5911080	You just don't play the main storyline.
5911120	5911540	Who cares?
5912700	5916122	Once in a while, I'm okay with Oscar-worthy video games, though.
5916182	5917942	Like, you know, Journey is like a Night of the Mets, right?
5917962	5919383	Seriously, Saints Row the Third is fun.
5919643	5920303	It's pretty fun.
5921244	5928448	There's a little bit of repetition when it comes to some of the activities and stuff, but I think Saints Row III was fun, and Saints Row II was actually pretty fun.
5928549	5931030	So Saints Row IV sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun too.
5931270	5931971	All right, let's move on.
5931991	5932791	We got derailed a little bit.
5932811	5933852	Did you just say your thing?
5933892	5934993	No, no, I haven't done that yet.
5935733	5943379	Last but not least, they're trying to bring back sort of a spiritual successor to Police Quest.
5944119	5946201	It's actually being done by the same creator.
5947281	5954486	Robert Lindsley is trying to kickstart a game called Precinct.
5955427	5958629	Right now, their funding goal is half a million dollars.
5960110	5964673	Apparently, the game is going to be very similar to...
5965974	5991496	I guess the police quest series and if you're looking to get a game similar to that then maybe you should try backing this right now as a recording they are up to $50,000 probably actually close to $51,000 still a ways away from their goal but they have 25 days left so there is a chance and some of the concept art looks actually pretty sweet it's all like first person you have like the patrol view and stuff like that looks like it could be pretty cool
5994548	5999771	and I like their precinct funding chart here they said our campaign 500,000 awesome 600,000 awesomer 700,000 mega awesome 800,000 plus badonk
6010120	6017442	Alright, well hopefully this movie will be pretty badonk, but the first signs of the World of Warcraft movie was shown at Comic-Con.
6017482	6019803	The teaser trailer unveiled at Comic-Con.
6020083	6029206	But here's the thing, the movie doesn't have any stars attached yet, so there wasn't really a lot to show, but the teaser did have a mix of live action and computer generated effects.
6029986	6037509	It was out in a desert field and had an armored human warrior that drank a potion and then drew a sword just before battling a hammer wielding orc.
6038489	6046934	Of course, as we all know, Duncan Jones, who did Source Code and Moon, and also importantly is David Bowie's son, is helming the Warcraft film.
6047274	6049175	It's supposed to begin shooting in early 2014.
6049715	6052157	I'm assuming that means released in probably 2015.
6053758	6057520	Can Bowie get like a monarch position in the movie?
6057640	6059301	I would love that.
6059461	6061162	Perhaps the king of the goblins?
6061582	6067747	I think the reason why he goes by the name Duncan Jones is he doesn't want to be in the shadow of his dad, though.
6067927	6072871	So I would really, really be surprised if David Bowie turns up in this at all.
6073152	6076394	And maybe he can do a little dance magic dance.
6077495	6081117	Now, by the way, this clip is not on the internet for us to see.
6081217	6082658	I don't know if it leaked out to YouTube.
6082678	6083679	I'm sure it's out there somewhere.
6084019	6099889	But Blizzard has said there is no plans to release the mood piece that was shown at Comic-Con that was only for Comic-Con and not for public consumption, which I'm actually okay with because, again, it's not real footage from the movie, so to speak, because there's no stars attached yet or anything.
6099969	6100149	So...
6100949	6102791	Interesting though that it's a human versus an orc.
6104272	6106313	The movie is also just called Warcraft.
6106494	6107915	It's not called World of Warcraft.
6108195	6109936	So I'm wondering if they're taking it way back.
6110356	6114820	They might be taking the story way back to the original humans versus orcs story, which is alright.
6116144	6117706	I used to all be about Sylvanas and that's it
6137488	6144310	If you would like to have your voice featured in the game as a Madonkan, you can be in the remake there.
6144710	6152973	You just have to record in a microphone there a few phrases, and you make a SoundCloud account, make sure things sound fine, don't have a lot of feedback in the background or whatever.
6153553	6158915	It's over on the official blog, oddworld.com, and you have to get those in by Friday, July 26th.
6159815	6161335	But you could have your voice featured in the game.
6161355	6162456	I wonder if I should send something in.
6162496	6163256	I think that might be fun.
6163636	6165136	I could use the recording equipment here.
6165896	6168737	You have to say such things as, wait, I'm pulling up the blog here.
6169117	6172858	Some of the, like, it was very simple stuff.
6172898	6176539	Some of it was like, ow, og, you know, things like that.
6177739	6179960	Yeah, which of course now it's not coming up.
6180040	6183601	But anyhow, let me try one more time.
6183841	6185261	This link here might show it.
6187731	6188871	Live radio, of course.
6188911	6189311	There we go.
6190672	6204194	The words to say are hello, okay, laughing, giggling, angry, hissing, pain grunts, death screams, and bonus points for providing some sound effects for the wildlife of Mudos, birds, scarabs, elumes, etc.
6206134	6211635	Just get on the microphone and make strange noises because somebody's going to have to listen to it.
6214596	6215716	Is your mic not on, DarkSakura?
6215756	6216916	The chat room's bitching.
6218638	6219279	Oh, you were muted.
6219600	6220742	Damn it, Rob!
6220862	6223306	That's awesome.
6223326	6224388	That's totally my bad.
6224408	6225109	Sorry, DarkSakura.
6225329	6226331	That was not awesome.
6226351	6227233	That was lame!
6228362	6230484	Boy, we're all sorts of broken here at OLR tonight.
6230504	6230924	Sorry about that.
6231965	6235929	Anyhow, okay, DarkSakura, I have a new story to make it all better, okay?
6236069	6236470	It better.
6236670	6237731	All right, so here's the deal.
6238151	6242415	Capcom working on what they're calling a major IP for the Nintendo 3DS.
6242495	6244077	It's called Geist Crusher.
6244517	6249622	It's a multiplayer game where you're going to fight monsters known as Geists, or G-A-I-S-T-S, Geists.
6250243	6250923	Here's the thing, though.
6250963	6253005	Geist Crusher, co-developed by Treasure.
6253826	6265055	so there you go the announcements on Treasure's website treasure-inc.co.jp so Capcom and Treasure are coming together for this so did that make it a little better?
6266256	6281929	I might be a little tingly alright then why don't you do some news with your now newly on mic yeah thanks Rob well in other news it's actually not pulling up great oh yeah Valve
6283440	6285220	Well, they will not give us a Half-Life 3 yet.
6287641	6289221	Because they don't love you.
6290821	6291902	Oh, they don't love somebody.
6294562	6302163	So, they are actually working with the modding community.
6302703	6309405	So, they're basically... Come on, thing.
6309465	6311805	I'm sorry, it's my iPad being stupid.
6312791	6323836	So basically, they are doing the Half-Life campaign as a co-op, and it's going to be put on for free, and it's going to be available through Steam.
6324897	6326858	So that is at least something new, right?
6327858	6331140	And it's the Sven co-op as a standalone game.
6333726	6350050	and other news, this makes me super happy there's an Adventure Time game it's actually going to be out in the fall on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U and 3DS and it's called Adventure Time, explore the dungeon because I don't know
6352381	6354003	Stan Lee Howard the Duck
6371903	6372784	and Squirrel Girl.
6373384	6379047	I love Squirrel Girl because she kicked the crap out of Thanos and Doctor Doom and did it legit through the power of squirrels.
6380488	6383230	So yeah, also included there's Doctor Doom, Jean Grey.
6383410	6385191	What exactly is the power of squirrels?
6385652	6386532	She talks to squirrels.
6386712	6388013	Her power is control of squirrels.
6388633	6394357	And she can speak squirrel language and she also has sharp teeth and little claws and a big bushy tail and she can climb up trees.
6395959	6397820	She also can kick anybody's ass.
6397860	6400020	Apparently Squirrel Girl cannot be defeated by anybody.
6400700	6402181	And she's also Jessica Jones' nanny.
6402801	6403821	So that makes her super cool.
6405722	6417886	But yeah, also confirmed as Doctor Doom, Jean Grey, Elektra, Magneto, Silver Samurai, Punisher, Beast, Gambit, Storm, Green Goblin, Juggernaut, Rhino, The Thing, Vulture, Sabretooth, and Invisible Woman.
6418746	6422707	So we also will have Coulson in the game.
6424352	6428195	and you have a pre-order exclusive of the Iron Patriot and Deadpool.
6429657	6430357	So, there you go.
6432579	6437984	Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week, which, oh my gosh, this is one of the most popular ones we've ever asked.
6438004	6439285	There's so many answers this week.
6439365	6440006	I don't know what to do.
6440086	6442088	Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6448487	6452470	You take Facebook and Google, you slam them together, you get Foogle.
6452711	6456954	And we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities every week here on the show.
6457695	6458455	And it's Foogle.
6459356	6464840	And I knew the news about Strider was going to make DarkSakura very happy.
6465141	6467983	And Dan, we talked about that in Part A. I feel all squishy now.
6468143	6497531	so I wanted to ask a similar question of the listeners tonight with a Google question of the week and that is what long dormant series would you like to see make a comeback and I said listeners you only get to pick one to try and keep the answers a little bit short tonight there are alone like 23 answers on Facebook should I read them all that's a lot do it I'm going to read them all quickly I'm only going to read like little bits and pieces if I don't read the entire answer I'm sorry you'll just have to go read them for yourself facebook.com slash orange launch radio or google plus community
6497731	6498111	Guess what?
6498371	6498552	What?
6498772	6499512	You're not really sorry.
6499712	6500573	All right.
6500613	6503034	VxChaseNyxV says, Bust a groove.
6503695	6507937	But this also means it would probably end up a Kinect Move or Wiimote dancing game.
6507957	6508898	Bust a move.
6509218	6509658	Move.
6510119	6512220	Well, it depends what country.
6512800	6515001	UnfoldedRaptor says, A new Gex game.
6515362	6517823	Even if it's not Gex 4, just a really nice reboot.
6518724	6519324	Yeah, that'd be fun.
6519984	6525648	Rob himself says, A remake of California games because he played that to death on the Sega Master System along with Strider.
6527671	6544149	James S says I want a new entry to the Soul Blazer saga but I'd settle for a remastered Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia Terra Enigma trilogy for my 3DS that is a fucking great answer I'll have you know I would love that too Jeremy J our buddy from Koopa Club says Mega Man
6545273	6561891	see here's the thing with Mega Man though is that although Capcom has been real they've just been dicks about it to an extent like at least there was Mega Man 9 and 10 and those weren't that long ago all things considered and the Mega Man and Smash Brothers thing now I
6562111	6576445	I admit, I as much as the next person would like to see a new, you know, 3D Mega Man Legends or just like a Mega Man 11 in the 2-bit style or, you know, kind of like a 2.5D kind of Mega Man game I think would be awesome, especially maybe on like the Wii U or something, but I don't know.
6577005	6586274	Mega Man's not as, it hasn't been as horribly long for Mega Man yet as some other games I can think of like on the Nintendo and so forth, but.
6587080	6587740	I don't know.
6588160	6589141	The Guardian Legend.
6589161	6590921	Seriously?
6591121	6596043	I don't think anybody answered Guardian Legend to which I say All of these people are wrong.
6596103	6598443	It's unfortunate that all of our listeners had to be wrong tonight.
6600484	6603145	Gaming Nerd said a new Alex Kidd game.
6603465	6607086	He's been featured in Sega Collections but never a new game or a remake of his own.
6607426	6609206	It would be nice to see Alex Kidd come back, wouldn't it?
6610146	6615488	DJ Rama S says one of the most underrated and underappreciated fighting games, Rival Schools.
6616536	6617496	Yeah, I love rival schools.
6617576	6618957	Zether says, Gradius.
6619137	6621157	Konami's kept it locked up for far too long.
6621737	6623538	But didn't we have Gradius 5 just a few years ago?
6624598	6626179	Was it really that, not that long ago?
6626219	6627239	I don't think it was that long ago.
6628880	6631340	William Murderface says, A sequel to Darkwatch.
6631700	6633581	It would be Halo, but with vampire cowboys.
6634421	6634941	That'd be cool.
6636062	6639403	Fifth Dream says, I was talking about Section Z and would love to see it make a comeback.
6640723	6643544	Kareem J says, Streets of Rage 4.
6643784	6644084	Thanks.
6645310	6648483	Loco Poco says, I'd love to see an Illbleed sequel.
6648544	6650431	It was a great mixture of horror and camp.
6652192	6654354	Uh, Nikki E says, Streets of Rage.
6654474	6656115	I still keep coming back to that game series.
6656635	6658317	Codeman says, Mega Man Legends.
6659217	6664721	Uh, Rich B says, not really a series, but I've always wanted to see a follow-up to Midnight Resistance on the Sega Genesis.
6664741	6665862	Midnight Resistance is a good game.
6666162	6666823	Yeah, it'll be.
6667624	6670586	Especially something kind of like really off the radar like that.
6670606	6671466	Like they don't ever have like one game.
6671486	6672367	I think they've done it for Classic.
6672847	6673928	You probably have at some point.
6674949	6676090	But still, I mean, you know, they're...
6677031	6682316	Like he said in the answer, there was never a series there, just one really good game that we want to see something else with.
6683637	6689843	Ragenator says, Samurai Showdown series, provided that an update stays true to the original five games, 2Ds and Pixels.
6690123	6694187	They actually said that they were completely closing the series off after five, so I don't think that's happening.
6694287	6694868	Bastards.
6695308	6696229	We'll open it back up.
6698531	6698952	Let's see.
6699312	6700954	Edgar R. says, a new duck hunt.
6702352	6703513	This time, the dog dies.
6704674	6708118	Gamer Girl says, even though this isn't a series, I'd love to see Kid Chameleon.
6708158	6708859	I love that game.
6709279	6709760	It's a good pick.
6710260	6712162	Chiggers says, Altered Beast.
6713123	6714885	Yeah, make it better this time, too.
6715746	6717848	K&IM says, Secret of Evermore.
6718269	6722013	I'd be happy if they released it again on anything, but Square doesn't want my money, evidently.
6722313	6729003	Yeah, Secret of Evermore kind of gets crapped on because it was the Square USA title and it wasn't really part of the second Detsetsu series.
6729023	6732167	It was like a spinoff, but Secret of Evermore had some neat stuff about it.
6732448	6738356	Did you know that that was one of the first soundtracks that, what's his name, Jeremy Soule, that guy that does the soundtracks for Elder Scrolls and stuff?
6738918	6740199	He did the soundtrack for Secret of Evermore.
6740219	6741219	It was one of his first games ever.
6741259	6742520	He was probably like 19 when he did it.
6742640	6743300	How's that game?
6744421	6751304	I think Secret of Evermore was really shit on when it first came out, but I think Time has treated it well.
6751925	6755046	It wasn't as bad as everybody made it out to be at the time.
6755126	6760389	It just wasn't a Seiken Detsetsu game, really, even though they kind of tried to make it one.
6761409	6766013	Um, Peker Uno says, it would have to be the platform that got me into gaming in the first place.
6766093	6768916	Commander Keen would have to be 2D though.
6769977	6776503	Uh, DarkTetsuya says, with the resurrection and Capcom Arcade cabinet, how about a sequel or something to Black Dragon slash Black Tiger?
6777023	6780566	I want to say Magic Sword was a sequel to it, but there hasn't been another one since that.
6780947	6782688	Maybe they could implement Oculus Rift support.
6782988	6783349	Ha ha ha.
6785010	6786710	Tim Tripp says, Free Space?
6787331	6790232	I'd just like to see the return of the epic space combat genre.
6791672	6793733	Anomalous Underdog says, Vagrant Story.
6794053	6795194	I even thought of a name for it.
6795354	6796094	Vagrant Army.
6796594	6799215	You know, we used to call that Fragrant Story because it stinks.
6800216	6802837	No, I know it's not bad, but that was the joke at my house.
6803326	6804527	SSJ100 Matt says, really?
6804587	6806548	No one's going to say Chrono Trigger or Chrono Cross?
6806588	6807389	It's long overdue.
6808830	6818936	Slidekick says, with the upcoming release of DuckTales Remastered, I'd love to see the return of more of Capcom's classic Disney platformers, like a modern tale on the adventures in the Magic Kingdom.
6819296	6824199	It's a fun blend of different games with a flawless Disney theme, and I think a new version would even be more immersive.
6824580	6829783	As long as it was more like Nintendo Land and not so much like Kinect Disneyland Adventures, which was sadly a big flop.
6830163	6834685	But here's the thing, though, is that Connect Disneyland Adventures kind of was Adventures in the Magic Kingdom.
6835085	6838426	I mean, they really were the same type of thing.
6838486	6841667	It's just that Magic Kingdom was out when you were a kid.
6842247	6846589	So it held up a little better than Connect Disneyland Adventures did, I think.
6848049	6851691	and lastly on Facebook Shane says Rising Zan.
6851951	6857994	It will leave you with a theme and I'll leave you with a theme song because that should be enough to spike some second hand sales of the game.
6858354	6859515	How can anyone not love this?
6859595	6860775	It's a ninja cowboy.
6863197	6864337	Rising Zan was a fun game.
6864617	6869300	And came back home with the heart of a gunman and the soul of a samurai.
6869320	6870280	Let me skip ahead a bit.
6870420	6874202	His name would learn the Shogun way of life.
6874262	6875743	The blue eyes of the sun.
6877887	6878307	Bizz Pokemon Snap
6894727	6896608	Travis H says Shining Force.
6897349	6898349	Ooh, this is a good answer.
6898689	6900370	Actdeft says Uniracers.
6900390	6901731	I think it was awesome.
6901751	6902292	Lord, no.
6902492	6902732	What?
6903252	6904453	That game pissed me off so much.
6904473	6904933	Get out.
6905514	6906534	I was so good at that game.
6906874	6908215	You know what was kind of a sequel?
6908515	6910497	Uniracers was Excite Truck in a way.
6910677	6913578	Like the same type of thing with the stunts and everything and midair and all that.
6913779	6914239	A little bit.
6914359	6914759	A little bit.
6915700	6916000	All right.
6916826	6921667	Lots of great answers, you guys, except you all failed for not mentioning the Guardian legend.
6921747	6922087	Get out.
6922327	6927708	Honestly, though, the Uniracer unicycle should come back as a Smash Bros.
6927788	6928548	fighting character.
6928648	6928948	Yes.
6929828	6930688	It would be pretty sweet.
6930748	6932249	It would be awesome.
6932269	6935909	Well, I suppose if Sega can have Daytona cars fighting, then we can have a fighting unicycle.
6935949	6936449	That's right.
6937290	6942030	Or at least as like a power-up or something, like Princess Peach can ride the unicycle around and do tricks or something.
6942090	6942330	I don't know.
6943111	6943431	All right.
6943671	6944691	Let's get back into some more news.
6944771	6945011	Loki.
6945931	6947332	All right.
6948173	6952357	So they're doing this really interesting promotion, I guess.
6952817	6956000	It's OUYA's $1 million Free the Games Fund.
6956240	6961005	They're boosting Kickstarter games, or Kickstarted games, I guess.
6961505	6963347	So what's going to happen is, I guess, between...
6963727	6967470	August 9th and August 10th next year.
6969092	6975116	I guess a game will qualify as long as it's achieved its minimum goal of $50,000.
6975917	6980120	And Ouya will match the total raised up to $250,000.
6980201	6990489	So I'm guessing this is going to be quite limited if you're going to only have a million dollars to shuffle around and
6992267	6994849	We're going to pledge up to $250,000.
6996550	7010319	Also, I guess the game will receive an additional $100,000 if it's one of the most successful Kickstarter projects to take part in the Free the Games program.
7011460	7022007	I believe that the trick with that, there is a big but, you need to have your game exclusive for the OUYA for six months.
7023529	7027477	So, that's the only drawback, I guess.
7027517	7028319	That's cheating.
7030783	7032086	But hey, free money, right?
7032747	7033188	Money's good.
7035430	7035710	I don't know.
7035970	7037210	Money is always good, of course.
7038391	7042071	But don't they have to fix some of these other problems, like their customer service and so forth first?
7042131	7043352	God, that's what I suggested.
7043392	7047552	I'm like, hey, you know, the problem is that you don't have enough games on the system.
7047832	7049833	Although more would be good.
7050353	7053394	More would be good, but I don't think you're going to get... I mean, look at this.
7054794	7060415	I understand that games have budgets and stuff like that, and they can be quite expensive, especially if you have a team of people, but...
7062170	7062470	I don't know.
7062510	7067455	For an indie game, I would think $100,000 is quite a bit.
7067835	7070378	Especially if you're talking a small team of people.
7071796	7075039	That's a lot of money, I think.
7075099	7084407	Let's say if we're going to take the high end here, $250,000, so a total of half a million dollars for a game.
7084667	7086088	That's quite a bit.
7086949	7088410	It better be one hell of a good game.
7089151	7095096	There's some pretty decent games on there right now, but I don't think any of them cost half a million dollars or even $100,000 to make.
7098976	7106000	All right, well, moving on to a little quote about a spinoff for a very well-received game from this year.
7106020	7108081	It has to do with the Tomb Raider series.
7108621	7111243	And Gail Simone, who is a comic book veteran.
7111263	7112724	Yes, no, she is awesome.
7113164	7113384	Yeah?
7113944	7115005	What kind of other stuff has she done?
7115045	7115785	I don't follow comics.
7115805	7119267	She's one of the only reasons I ever read anything DC on purpose.
7119747	7123309	Because she did, what did she do?
7123990	7124490	Birds of Prey.
7125491	7127653	Ah, even I know what that is because that was a CW show.
7129275	7134559	But she is probably one of the best female comic book writers out there.
7134919	7135179	Awesome.
7135200	7139623	Well, she's teaming up with publisher Dark Horse to work on a Tomb Raider comic.
7139883	7142225	But what caught people's attention was this quote.
7142265	7148210	She said, quote, In continuity, it will be a Tomb Raider canon and lead directly into the sequel.
7148711	7149992	This is what got me excited.
7150412	7152414	We get to be part of Lara Croft history.
7152874	7153135	Well...
7153755	7159301	They haven't announced a sequel to Tomb Raider, so this quote kind of grabbed people's attention.
7159722	7163066	Although, I mean, let's be real, it would make a lot of sense.
7163526	7164908	Like you didn't expect a sequel.
7164928	7165529	Exactly, right?
7165589	7166510	Like the game was well received.
7166530	7167451	It did perform under...
7168692	7172554	Well, but we all kind of looked at that quote in the beginning and kind of went, really?
7173014	7173594	Really?
7173714	7174434	With that quote?
7174454	7176935	Are people just pulling this way out of context?
7177515	7179096	A, why not A plus?
7180777	7181457	That's right, right?
7181997	7189260	Well, plus, I would think that if they're going to make a sequel, it's going to likely use a lot of the same components that were in the original.
7189420	7193041	So like I'm saying, they don't have to necessarily reinvent the wheel with a sequel.
7193361	7196042	They can carry over a lot of stuff that they did with the first game.
7196063	7197103	I mean, granted, they'd want to do...
7197523	7199347	Bigger, better, and all that other stuff.
7199748	7203295	How can we kill her more?
7203755	7209006	But I would think that you wouldn't necessarily maybe have to put the same financial investment into it.
7210222	7232235	necessarily so maybe you could still get bang for the buck and maybe make up for this perceived lack although I don't know again I still think it seems like the game's done well and I'm sure it sold a ton of extra copies what was eight bucks on the steam sale this week and I'm sure there were a lot of people that snapped it up for that so I've had a lot of fun playing it so
7233034	7234795	Some other comments from Gail Simone.
7235075	7237076	The storytelling in the game hooked me instantly.
7237396	7241518	The biggest difference is the game told a claustrophobic story in an isolated setting.
7241818	7243519	We are going globetrotting.
7244100	7254285	So maybe if there is a sequel, if this ties into it, it will be more Laura exploring rather than the whole, you know, escape from, you know, Death Sentence Island.
7254345	7259307	She'll be seeking the legendary, elusive art thief, Carmen Sandiego.
7261579	7271345	Alright, so, anyhow, exciting that, I mean, although I think, you know, a sequel to Good Game is a bit of a duh, it's still exciting to hear that that's in development.
7271365	7273827	Speaking of franchise reboot, Carmen Sandiego.
7275666	7276286	I heard about this.
7276707	7278409	PBS has been teasing this, right?
7278930	7280552	No, I was just saying they should do a sequel.
7291966	7308847	but like I think they're doing something where they're going to play the old game show things again on PBS somebody in chat can help me fill in the gaps I just remember picking up bits and pieces of this on Twitter but like I think they are setting the stages for a Carmen Sandiego comeback so it's funny that you bring that up because like no legitimately there's there's something to that
7309281	7310162	You know what would be funny?
7312324	7315647	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego would have worked in the 80s?
7316688	7318610	But imagine having that now.
7318630	7323775	People would be like, well, just can't we do GPS and use CCTV and all this?
7323995	7325116	Yeah, we found her in five seconds.
7327078	7327679	Send a drone.
7327959	7328620	Or more like...
7330003	7330683	What country?
7331584	7332204	Where's that?
7332665	7333925	I've never heard of that country.
7334005	7334465	China!
7335646	7336286	Oh, stop.
7337127	7337467	All right.
7338047	7339028	Drew, that's made up.
7342030	7342830	You're so ignorant.
7343210	7344391	All right, DarkSakura, what do you got?
7345427	7345888	Stuff.
7346728	7347910	And it's not Carmen Sandiego.
7348010	7348690	It's about Atlas.
7349972	7358100	Basically, Nintendo... Well, you know Atlas filed for bankruptcy and everyone's worried about a particular series of theirs, Shin Megami Tensei.
7358140	7359501	Well, Nintendo's buying it.
7360142	7366228	So we may see a Persona 5 Wii U. Yeah, you made a noise.
7366328	7366628	I'm sorry.
7366888	7367189	Sorry, no.
7367209	7367949	I was laughing at chat.
7368150	7368330	Sorry.
7369042	7377827	But yeah, Atlas kind of screwed themselves, but Nintendo seems to be grabbing the hot one.
7378067	7380268	Because, you know, all the fans, that was what they were worried about.
7380288	7383950	What's going to happen with Persona, with Shin Megami Tensei?
7384071	7385952	So it looks like Nintendo's saving the series.
7386852	7390114	I thought this whole bankruptcy thing wasn't supposed to be this big of a deal.
7390234	7394617	And now here we're talking Nintendo's snapping up IPs.
7395718	7398720	How did things go from A to Z like that?
7398980	7402843	Well, they've already been working with Nintendo in this series because remember the crossover with Fire Emblem?
7404024	7411949	It was like if you have Shin Megami Tensei IV, they had a crossover promotion with Fire Emblem.
7412229	7415972	So if you had both of them, you'd get like $30 eShop credit in North America.
7417501	7444144	so that was a big thing but I think that there's a they're developing Shin Megami Tensei cross Fire Emblem for Wii U so I think it's going to be I think it's going to definitely be I would be something can you imagine if Persona 5 was a Wii U exclusive now that's that would be a pretty crazy grab there yeah it would be but it's smart it's a smart move oh yeah
7446735	7449916	Just real quick off, since we were talking about Carameldansen a second ago.
7450276	7454517	So I pulled up that article that Ranma linked in chat, and they were talking about different things.
7454577	7462060	And at the very bottom, of course, it said that Charlene, Teresa, Lynn, Thigpen, the one that was the chief on the show.
7462080	7463220	Oh, yeah, she passed away.
7463240	7464900	Yeah, she passed away in 2003 and stuff.
7464940	7471282	But what I found a little bit disturbing is on Wikipedia, it actually shows where the resting place is.
7471462	7473383	It tells you which cemetery she is buried in.
7473963	7474163	What?
7475203	7476664	There's a lot of wikis that do that.
7476684	7478204	Wikipedia has that on a lot of articles.
7478224	7478905	That's kind of weird.
7479225	7480245	No, a lot of articles say that.
7480505	7482086	And then there's this whole other site.
7482106	7484366	There's a whole site dedicated... Where are they buried, I think?
7484386	7487127	Yeah, there's a whole site dedicated to celebrity tombstones.
7487147	7489048	I actually... I don't know if I should...
7489508	7489828	I don't know.
7489848	7490709	To me, I'm like, no, thank you.
7490729	7491329	Not my thing, but...
7509059	7509319	Death Masks
7532050	7558179	for anyone who doesn't know what those are basically there's a plaster cast made and then they're cast in bronze or sometimes clay or different things but the the death masks are basically the faces at death once they're you know ready to be buried and saved but there's people who still do death masks to this day and there's websites that have all the modern death masks so I'm gonna have one done do Walt Disney have one done I don't think so I plan on having one done though really isn't that expensive
7559534	7561875	No, I know how much plaster and stuff costs.
7562356	7563576	Yeah, but you can't do it yourself.
7563837	7566578	No, but I have, Rob, how many artists do I know?
7566758	7569080	That's true, that's true.
7569580	7573762	It costs a lot to join that, what is it called, the Neptune Society or whatever, the people that'll dump you at sea?
7575503	7580626	Well, my funeral is going to be Jewish and easy.
7581687	7584789	Pine box buried 24 hours later, no embalming.
7585745	7590269	I've already mentioned I want to be flung out of a cannon at my work building during the lunch hour.
7590649	7591170	That's all I want.
7591190	7592791	We actually discussed what Dan wanted today.
7593372	7600697	What we're doing is we're putting him in his 69 Mustang coupe, loading it with explosives, pushing it off a cliff, and blowing it up in midair.
7601038	7601338	Awesome.
7602058	7606042	So, Genki style and Roger Corman style.
7607903	7608203	Fancy.
7608423	7608644	Yes.
7609284	7611826	I am having a Jewish burial and an Irish wake.
7611906	7613167	Are you calling us on original?
7614207	7614428	Yes.
7614468	7616269	Alright, moving on, Loki.
7616689	7621212	So, Harmonix is due some sweet, sweet money.
7622013	7625315	And that's because Viacom, they lost their appeal.
7625875	7633020	Which, you know, there was a whole lawsuit, I guess, that they had owed Harmonix some money.
7633801	7636262	And that includes now $299 million with interest.
7639604	7641825	So, good for Harmonix.
7641965	7645746	That should fund some extra tracks in Fantasia, right?
7647187	7655990	I guess now it says, Harmonix's law firm estimates a payout, including another dispute, I guess the company has, for a total of $533 million.
7656010	7656770	That's a sweet chunk of change.
7656790	7656970	Mm-hmm.
7664761	7666302	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
7687268	7713450	so this isn't just you know virtual console releases they are redone in the 3d i i wouldn't expect a whole lot more i mean that's that's really it like i don't think they're going back and redoing all the graphics or anything like that so don't get your hopes too far up but you will be able to experience 3d altered beast 3d echo the dolphin 3d galaxy force 2 3d shinobi 3 3d sonic the hedgehog 3d space harrier 3d streets of rage and 3d super hang on i've
7713490	7720134	I think that should look pretty cool considering that some of the 3D converts we've seen so far have been NES titles and now these are like 16-bit.
7720554	7722615	3D Space Harrier is going to be sweet.
7723523	7726345	I... Like, 3D Kid Icarus was really cool.
7726485	7730168	Like, they didn't change a lot, but it was just... Like, it was very subtle.
7730308	7735272	Like, they added the backgrounds, very subtle updates that made it really cool.
7735472	7736513	Like, I like that one a lot.
7737473	7739995	But, like, some of the 3D remakes were a little silly.
7740035	7742037	Like, 3D Wrecking... No, not Wrecking Crew.
7742217	7743218	Urban Champion or whatever.
7743238	7744459	That was a little silly.
7745079	7748101	But, yeah, it'll be cool to check out a couple of these.
7748181	7749802	I don't know about 3D Altered Beast.
7749842	7750303	Like, I don't...
7750803	7752785	Wise from your grave.
7753326	7757790	People remember that epicness from the arcade when they were a kid and stuff, but I played through the game recently.
7757850	7759232	It's really not that good.
7759632	7760953	It's really not that good.
7761754	7765578	But 3D Sonic will be cool, even though it'll be like the 17th time I've played Sonic.
7765938	7766919	But 3D Space Harrier.
7767420	7768221	Yes, I'm here for that.
7768401	7769442	Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
7769582	7770022	Get ready.
7770683	7771304	I'm getting ready.
7772044	7772865	My body is ready.
7773065	7773386	Your body.
7774557	7775778	Are you in the fantasy zone, Rob?
7775838	7776098	Yes.
7776919	7778360	Alright, are you in the mailbag zone?
7778440	7778900	Do we have you?
7778920	7779601	Yes, we have two.
7779781	7781322	We do have emails tonight, woohoo!
7781502	7782563	Two whole emails!
7783343	7789888	You can email us too, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Well great, I better pay attention because I have no idea what these are about tonight.
7789908	7790848	I didn't get to read them in advance.
7791069	7793270	Well this comes from Brad, our podculture Brad.
7793770	7794711	Hi podculture Brad!
7795231	7799735	At the end of part A, you guys said there were not any emails yet, so how about a kitty pic instead?
7799755	7802597	So they sent us a picture of his kitty patting at the screen.
7803968	7804949	Oh, that's adorable.
7805049	7808572	Hi, Kitty.
7808833	7810755	I'm going to get to meet Brad in five weeks.
7810775	7812477	I'm excited.
7812497	7815700	I am super pissed at my cat.
7816220	7816421	Why?
7817001	7819764	Because she's trying to chew on my 3DS charge cable.
7820945	7824029	And every time I move it out of her way, she's like, uh-uh, I'm going to get it.
7824769	7825070	Meow.
7825848	7827530	You need to buy her a shoestring or something.
7828051	7828992	I have toys for her.
7829053	7832577	She plays with all of Shermie's toys because Shermie's too fat and lazy.
7833098	7834620	Except I won't give her Shermie's mousy.
7835201	7836884	But you know what?
7836944	7838546	This house that we're looking at has a cat door in it.
7842235	7842715	Next email.
7843355	7844495	Hey, it's Rissimo.
7844835	7852437	I haven't emailed or called in like forever, but just a quick thank you for all your hard work and dedication to your craft and to your fans.
7853037	7855558	I've been listening since I first heard about you guys on Joystick.
7856478	7857178	We were on Joystick.
7857218	7858218	We were on Joystick?
7858658	7859759	When the hell did that happen?
7861939	7863741	Oh!
7864061	7868784	Yes, they used to do like a weekly podcast thing and I think we were featured once.
7869424	7877450	Actually, I remember PlayStation Joystick site did a really nice write-up on olrpsp.com some time ago.
7877510	7878350	That was really cool.
7878971	7881673	And I want to say probably when the whole...
7882895	7883155	Gagahamster
7899232	7903315	Yes, which by the way, just the Glamster was what we were going to call it.
7903876	7907638	AkumaJP, bless his heart, did do some research on Glamster.
7908199	7910100	And they don't have a Twitter, it seems like.
7910160	7911882	But he did get us the website.
7911982	7914544	It's bergsala-lightweight.co.jp
7916485	7918747	It's like the pretty, pretty princess of hamsters.
7939048	7947294	So I wanted to bombard their Twitter and try to take another social media campaign like we did with President Cat to its horrendous success.
7947795	7950377	But no luck.
7950397	7952518	There's no Twitter to bug them through.
7952558	7954880	But we'll keep trying.
7956361	7959364	Of course, you remember the Katamari debacle of yesteryear.
7959944	7964828	Haven't missed a single episode and felt the need to say thanks for getting me through so many work days.
7965268	7965848	I love you all.
7965928	7966649	Thanks once again.
7966789	7967690	Sent from my iPhone.
7969005	7969725	Well, that was very nice.
7969745	7972026	There was no questions or opinions.
7972186	7973506	I like nice emails.
7973666	7974526	Thank you.
7974766	7976807	That was just a good old-fashioned thank you.
7976947	7980007	Especially, there was only one missing comma.
7981268	7982728	So I was quite pleased.
7983408	7984368	Well, and you're welcome.
7984988	7985689	And thank you for that.
7986729	7989169	It's always really awesome to see things like that.
7989509	7991550	You get an invisible gold star for awesome.
7994195	8000559	Yeah, I gotta say, I so appreciate the small gestures people have done to just kind of say thanks for OLR.
8000619	8007102	Like, you know, Codeman got me Borderlands 2 because I was bitching about wanting it last week and he was kind enough to get that for me.
8007402	8008063	That means a lot.
8008503	8013966	And I got a trading card I wanted just because somebody had it and was like, hey, I like OLR.
8014066	8014727	Here, have this.
8014787	8015327	I know you need it.
8015927	8017488	And, like, didn't expect anything in return.
8017508	8018749	And I was like, that's all.
8018809	8022411	Even though those cards are only like 18 cents, still, it's just like the gesture is like, oh my god.
8022952	8024714	Usually the small gestures I get are lewd.
8030042	8031745	I got a wiener for you, DarkSakura.
8034750	8037434	Oh, Slidekick found our article.
8038806	8042548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8069813	8070793	It's an old article.
8071073	8075474	And I'll tell you what, probably updated it the last time they ran that article.
8075674	8077135	It was the last time you updated it?
8077155	8077835	Yeah.
8078455	8091898	You know, actually, I'm getting the emails from GoDaddy to renew OrangeLoungeRadio.com, which obviously that'll happen, even though we really need to do something with that website to modernize it a little bit and get it away from the hackers.
8092298	8096939	But OLRPSP.com is up for renewal, and I'm questioning if I should renew it.
8097159	8097559	Probably not.
8099099	8103181	I kind of feel like there's people that'll be pissed off if I let it go.
8103261	8103881	No, no, no, hold on.
8104901	8106922	I just had a Facebook comment the other day.
8106942	8111003	You can still access it by going to orangelaunchradio.com slash PSP.
8111624	8112024	Oh, okay.
8112184	8116505	So... All right, then I feel better letting it go if that's going to be the case.
8116606	8118606	Yeah, because in fact, I'll still check this real quick.
8118626	8120207	You have such a cute kitty, Brad.
8121467	8123788	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's slash PSP.
8123848	8124729	I think that actually...
8127017	8145197	Yes, yeah, see, if you do orangeonstreet.com slash PSP Okay, well that's cool, then yeah, I might let olrpsp.com lapse, if there's still a way to get to it Alright A lot of these pages don't work anymore Ranma, secret message, send me some I will Alright
8147266	8150450	TigerClaw says, why not change OLR PSP to a mobile site?
8151431	8151931	Eh, no.
8152652	8154293	Yeah, I kind of feel the same.
8154353	8156275	It's like, that's a lot of work to maintain.
8156315	8160339	And I think a lot of the focus right now is also on building VOG Network.
8160399	8162601	It's kind of like the central hub and making that bigger and better.
8162821	8163802	Network's okay on mobile.
8164123	8169208	Yeah, and that, you know, I think the next step at some point for VOG will be a mobile app.
8169608	8170869	But that's, you know...
8171830	8172650	in the future.
8172870	8173750	Ways away.
8174031	8175551	Don't get excited about that.
8175791	8176471	Long ways out.
8177311	8183153	You'll probably see it'll come out around the time Zelda's finally out on Wii U. All right.
8184593	8184933	Let's see.
8186834	8187694	That's it for emails, right?
8188714	8189134	Yar.
8189274	8192515	If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
8193055	8196996	That means it's the time in the show when we do the F use of the week.
8213672	8214392	My F.U.
8215353	8217473	goes to this cough that will not go away.
8218194	8220455	The conditions of some of the houses we've seen.
8220815	8223736	Because there were like burnt carpet and cat pee smells.
8224636	8227057	Some of these people, like the HUD houses, oh my god, it's so bad.
8227497	8228478	And then another F.U.
8228498	8230298	just to the housing industry in general.
8230858	8233940	Because it's really like this weird...
8235040	8237681	I'll keep my fingers and my toes crossed.
8237821	8237901	Loki!
8261553	8264796	Uh, just fuck you, yeah, because I still don't have a fixed controller yet.
8264916	8272765	Even though it sort of seems like it's going on the right track, I thought the same thing back on July 1st, and look where we are now.
8273266	8273987	So, fuck them.
8276226	8276486	That's it?
8276506	8276927	That's it.
8277948	8290519	My FU goes to the fact that I can't follow through things on certain things that I say I'm going to do and convince myself that I'm going to do, but then I'm just like, but you can't really do that, even though you probably should.
8290779	8291580	Go to the gym, Rob.
8292273	8293955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8315003	8315303	All right.
8315444	8324012	Anyhow, back to a couple more news stories in the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8324973	8331520	So, I guess Namco is prepping a HD version of Soul Calibur 2.
8331940	8336765	Soul Calibur 2 HD Online coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this fall.
8337265	8345808	I'm assuming as a download title because I haven't seen anything on here that says that it's going to be released at retail.
8346668	8348709	I know I haven't heard of anything yet about retail.
8349449	8355952	But yeah, apparently the game is going to be closer to HD now.
8355972	8356932	The outputting at 720p.
8356972	8357312	I don't know.
8363191	8363411	Neat.
8363811	8366172	I'm assuming that the special characters aren't going to be in the game.
8366192	8371273	I mean, because you probably can't get spawn or, you know, obviously Link's not going to be back because he was only on GameCube.
8371893	8373553	And the Heihachi?
8374513	8374713	Yeah.
8376174	8376874	So no Link.
8376914	8378894	Oh, yeah, because that was GameCube.
8378914	8379895	I mean, yeah.
8380835	8381855	So I don't know.
8384736	8386416	It's bad it's not coming to Wii U.
8387927	8389428	Yeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?
8389809	8390369	But you never know.
8390409	8392931	I mean, you never know, but... Yeah, we're kind of not getting my hopes up.
8392951	8394092	This Wii doesn't run games, I guess.
8395353	8396013	Yes, it does.
8396073	8396554	Be quiet.
8397074	8397795	Stop trolling.
8398896	8401918	All right, well, one more news story for you guys before we open up the Skype line.
8401978	8403920	And I gotta say, this is a really...
8404480	8405360	All You Can Arcade
8420683	8421264	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8436923	8437624	brought to you.
8438245	8441288	And you can swap them out for a different one in stock or whatever.
8441409	8445674	Now, it's only in certain areas because they bring the games to you, which is pretty amazing.
8446034	8451260	It's only available in the San Francisco Bay Area, Stockton, San Jose, Santa Rosa, and Sacramento.
8451420	8452402	Yes, Sacramento has it.
8454103	8454623	DarkSakura.com
8483122	8498673	Which is crazy, I mean it's very ambitious I should probably share that with Dan's Pinball Group Yeah, I mean I didn't see if there were actually But yeah, some of the cabinets they have on here, I mean most of them are old stuff But still, you know, Bad Dudes, Ms.
8498733	8507600	Pac-Man, I'm looking at the site Which we're totally just giving them free advertising here But whatever, it's a neat idea And it's really taking the Netflix thing to the next level, isn't it?
8507620	8509141	I love the totally fake picture though
8509733	8511956	Oh yeah, these little gals playing the game and having fun.
8511976	8513277	And the little black dresses and heels.
8513417	8514679	Dude, versus Goonies.
8514739	8515460	That's awesome.
8515600	8516060	I want that.
8516080	8516481	That's cool.
8517461	8518902	Where can you view what they have?
8519462	8521503	Allyoucanarcade.com Yeah, I went there.
8522143	8523464	Signing up.
8523664	8525905	Oh, you can actually browse games available in my area.
8525945	8526266	Wow.
8526686	8526886	Where?
8527006	8527926	I put in my zip code here.
8528026	8529007	Just in the upper right corner.
8530188	8535150	Bad Dudes, Berserk, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Golden Tee.
8535790	8536611	This isn't all of them.
8536651	8538172	I'm just looking at... Heavy Barrel's a good one.
8538952	8539192	Yes!
8539212	8539612	Silkworm.
8540093	8540333	What?
8540793	8543334	Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.
8543654	8544375	Get out, really?
8544575	8545075	Yes!
8546276	8546516	I didn't...
8548195	8550556	Oh my god, there is a DDR machine.
8550576	8552377	But you were just looking at area.
8553197	8554638	Oh yeah, I was looking at area.
8554658	8555478	This is looking at Sacramento.
8556098	8558279	It might not be available in your area necessarily.
8559840	8562261	But still, that's the type of game they're willing to rent.
8562381	8563482	One might show up, Loki.
8563942	8565162	They need a 2DX on that list.
8565462	8565883	Oh boy.
8565903	8566803	I will rent it forever.
8568892	8569212	All right.
8569612	8578318	Yeah, I may have to hog that if I actually... Hey, if the idea does well and I just totally gave them free advertising... Dude, I would totally just want to buy that.
8578598	8579318	It's kind of neat.
8580099	8581820	So anyway, there you go.
8581980	8582380	That's it.
8582681	8584482	That's it for the stories we had on deck tonight.
8584522	8586663	So we're going to open up our Skype line if you want to give us a call.
8586683	8590586	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8590606	8594429	If there's something you want to talk about tonight that we haven't brought up, we'll get to Twitter topics in a minute here.
8594489	8596150	But first, some last-minute stories.
8596450	8598131	DarkSakura, I think you said you had one tonight, right?
8598331	8625558	I do and I seriously thought I'd put it in my stories and I didn't so this goes out to all the homestucks basically Hussie shut up basically Hussie is going to be working with Namco doing a dating sim the game is called Namco High and it is a fictional crossover high school that all the Namco characters are going to so it's yeah date high school sim and
8627538	8631061	So basically it's going to be Namco character shipping the game.
8632503	8633684	Like everybody does with Homestuck.
8634184	8644933	So we're looking at characters from Xenogears, Tekken, Idolmaster, Bites and Kratos, so... Here we go with Pac-Man.
8644953	8645694	That sounds weird.
8646134	8646975	I'm totally getting it.
8646995	8648056	That sounds weird.
8648076	8651479	It's like that one sim that they had where you date, like, birds.
8651719	8651919	Yeah.
8653050	8655651	Oh, Hatafulboyfriend.
8656091	8657712	All right, let's go to the phones.
8658352	8659713	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8659733	8660093	Who's this?
8660713	8662334	It's the one and only Ranma.
8662394	8663695	Ranma, how's it going?
8664515	8665155	Good, good.
8665235	8667917	I just got a brand new mixer on Saturday.
8668197	8668917	Oh, congrats.
8669217	8674059	So we're going to hear an even more high-fidelity anime jam session soon.
8674079	8675360	Either that or lots of margaritas.
8677171	8680452	That'll happen provided Drew Nami doesn't knock the desk over.
8681132	8682253	Don't invite him to your house.
8683633	8686254	I told him he had to sign a release form first.
8687074	8690856	In Drew Nami's defense, he came over on the 4th of July and didn't knock anything over.
8691196	8691636	Good job.
8691716	8693817	No, I actually, he needs to come back to the show.
8693857	8694637	It's been far too long.
8696498	8697478	That sounds pretty cool.
8697998	8699559	Well, congrats on your new mixing board.
8699599	8700159	What else is up?
8701680	8713464	Not much, but I want to stand behind Loki and join him in the lynching of Ouya because I have my own issues when it comes to gaming customer service.
8713784	8720567	And I was just close to literally losing my shit on Facebook and Twitter before they got back to me.
8721447	8724048	Well, why don't you air your grievances here?
8725225	8732428	Long story short, I bought a headset by Astro Gaming because I played them at PAX East last year and I loved them.
8732808	8736889	So what happened was there was a short in the headset or the mic was dead.
8737890	8745432	After waiting for the perfect time to pack up everything, I pack up the microphone, the headset, and the mixer because I was having troubles with that too.
8745973	8746433	Sent it out.
8746693	8749254	Two weeks later, I get a brand new mixer.
8750594	8753335	A brand new microphone, same headset.
8753775	8760218	And I'm looking at the new mixer and they're telling me the battery that I had works for it, but the new mixer doesn't use the battery.
8760758	8762419	There's a couple extra connectors on there.
8762659	8764820	I can't even use my optical out because they changed that.
8765340	8767221	So I'm like, whatever, I can work with it.
8767581	8770102	I can still do my podcasting and the music and so forth.
8770622	8771382	Plug in the mic.
8771542	8772583	Everything's working well.
8773624	8776466	A week later, the mics start shorting out again.
8777227	8782510	So I contact them, and I'm like, okay, what they're probably going to do is send me a new kit.
8782791	8784332	I pack up everything and send it back.
8784792	8788635	They're like, no, we need you to pack up everything, send it to us, and we'll send it back to you.
8789295	8791517	And I'm like, I use this for every day.
8791657	8792558	I can't be without it.
8792998	8797621	They say, okay, we'll send you a two-day UPS label.
8798042	8799923	I'm like, you're not helping me here.
8801624	8805486	So I end up going on their Twitter, their support Twitter, asking for help.
8805846	8809808	I go on their Facebook, asking for help, explaining everything.
8810769	8816491	I actually went as far as, when I was at PAX East this year, speaking to a rep at their booth to get this taken care of.
8816591	8819013	Wow, that's dedication to the cause.
8819733	8821594	I packed up all my equipment and took it down.
8821934	8825276	It's because I actually like the quality of the equipment.
8825596	8827417	It's just their customer service sucks.
8827817	8829498	And every email I get back from them,
8830560	8831641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8849620	8850781	Friday, I check Twitter.
8850821	8855603	I get a private message from the support saying they're so sorry since nothing has happened.
8855983	8857004	No one's gotten back to me.
8857364	8858484	And it's been 30 days.
8858985	8865628	I get in my email an actual phone number where I can call them and talk to them and explain the whole situation.
8867150	8870172	Wow, but did that actually fix it finally?
8870993	8874395	Not yet, because this past weekend I took a semi sort of sabbatical.
8874475	8877157	I just stepped away, just did my own thing.
8877777	8880800	Tomorrow, I'm going to call and just get this taken care of.
8880820	8885323	Because like I said, Astro, the headsets, the mixers, the stuff's really good.
8885483	8890927	I can't complain, because I use it for podcasting, listening to music, gaming on my consoles.
8891627	8891727	Yeah.
8891747	8891827	Yeah.
8918263	8919224	Alright, well anything else?
8919584	8921746	Any other grievances you want to air on tonight's OLR?
8922467	8922867	That's it.
8922947	8923628	I'll just say this.
8923908	8926050	If you buy this, buy it from Best Buy.
8926231	8927432	Get their service plan.
8927932	8931035	It'll save you a lot of frustration and hair on your head.
8931536	8931956	Fair enough.
8932236	8933377	Alright, you take care, Ranma.
8933918	8934478	You too, bro.
8934558	8935399	Alright, bye-bye.
8936880	8938261	Always good to hear from our buddy Ranma.
8938421	8940962	Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights here at the Voice Eats Network.
8941082	8941442	Totally.
8941883	8946625	While we wait for more calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
8946805	8948086	Loki, do you have anything for last minutes?
8948246	8957211	I don't have any last minute stories, but I'd like to, once again, because I threw around this idea on Twitter and all of it, I think I'm going to move forward with it, which is...
8957851	8974402	The, uh, Loki's 24-hour, uh, Total Noob Game Jam, basically, an experiment, because I've been going through this whole, like, game-making thing and actually just, you know, reading up a lot on programming and Unity and all that fun stuff, and now I just want to get my, get my hands dirty with it.
8975163	8980386	And so, the experiment is basically, I'm gonna spend 24 hours putting together a game.
8980466	8984469	Now, obviously, unlike regular game jams, I don't have enough time to sit...
8985410	8987111	It's not 24 consecutive hours.
8987592	8988733	Hold on, because our phone's lighting up.
8989073	8992456	We'll come back to your thoughts in a minute here, but let's go to the phones.
8992837	8993958	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8993978	8994358	Who's this?
8995359	8996941	Hey, hey, hey, it's LokiLives46.
8997521	8999403	Hey, say that again.
8999463	9001725	It's... LokiLives46.
9002146	9005369	LokiLives46, but no relation to our Loki.
9006471	9008011	No, no, no, unfortunately not.
9009132	9010772	I guess it is a commonly used name.
9011332	9012472	Wait, where did you get yours?
9012512	9015173	Yours did not come from Thor or anything.
9015213	9016333	Yours came from The Mask.
9016353	9017214	I'm a fan of Jim Carrey.
9017294	9019454	The Mask, way back when, right?
9020034	9021054	Yes, yes.
9021715	9024635	It's actually a bit of a persona I've taken up.
9026456	9029196	Yeah, it was a very mischievous little brat.
9029296	9031537	Wait, so yours is inspired from The Mask, too?
9032540	9033781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9054713	9055575	Well, so are we.
9055615	9057559	You're in good company here at the Voice Geeks Network.
9057579	9062008	I think we're all a little nerdy.
9062068	9063771	Anyways, how have things been going for you guys?
9064232	9064593	What's that?
9065384	9066624	How have things been going for you guys?
9068105	9068845	Fantastic!
9069445	9072967	How are you doing, DarkSakura?
9073267	9074267	That's what the listeners want to know.
9074307	9075087	How the hell are you?
9075488	9076248	I want this house.
9076728	9078269	You want this house that you've been looking at?
9078409	9078629	I'm longing.
9078649	9079289	She's house hunting.
9079489	9080109	I'm longing.
9080449	9080730	Yes.
9081130	9082470	But I'm employed now, so that's good.
9082570	9087752	And our Loki is full of gummy bears, but he just ran to the kitchen real quick.
9088532	9089913	I pity his porcelain right now.
9090313	9090733	Fine.
9090953	9092274	What, you're not a gummy bear fan?
9092374	9092874	What's up with that?
9093849	9096472	No, it's just that high concentration of sugar.
9096552	9097853	I'm allergic to them.
9098013	9101817	I already ate some of them, but there's no way I'm going to eat a ton of them.
9101897	9103379	It'll seriously make me feel sick.
9105161	9105761	Alright, fair enough.
9106082	9107503	Anyways, I'll let you guys get back to it.
9107863	9108784	Okay, fair enough.
9109245	9110927	No games you want to talk about tonight or anything?
9110947	9111828	What have you been playing?
9112909	9115732	I've just been crazy busy with work, so I haven't really had a chance to.
9117567	9119708	Well, you better get on that.
9119909	9123411	Last day of the Steam sale, last chance he games at a discount.
9123451	9124451	Put all that money to use.
9126332	9128193	Oh, my wallet doesn't like those Steam sales.
9128253	9129954	I'll tell you that much.
9129974	9130415	That happens.
9130475	9131015	All right, buddy.
9131035	9131755	Well, thanks for the call.
9131775	9132256	You take care.
9132976	9133396	Yeah, you too.
9133496	9134077	All right, bye.
9135497	9138139	He just called to ask, how the hell are you?
9139562	9140443	Alive and kicking.
9140923	9141324	It's hot.
9141464	9142345	It's very courteous.
9142365	9143486	Yeah, it is a little hot, isn't it?
9143546	9146449	It's not even like one of those... It's getting hot in here.
9146509	9150893	I'll make sure the AC is on while... Well, I think it doesn't... Aren't you guys cooking a pizza or something?
9150993	9151594	Oh, yeah.
9151614	9153275	He's making a baked potato or something.
9153295	9154116	Yeah, I see.
9154296	9156158	I'm sure these walls are really insulated.
9156198	9157239	Yeah, yeah.
9157279	9157559	Sorry.
9157860	9158060	Sorry.
9158320	9159821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9178268	9182509	We'll see if that's feasible or not, depending on where I actually have to record and the times and that kind of stuff.
9183249	9184349	I would like to livestream it.
9184369	9186230	At the very least, it's going to go up on YouTube.
9186950	9190131	And I want some sort of interactivity with that.
9190191	9193411	So obviously, chat room will be involved.
9193711	9198372	And I want to actually have polls at different parts during it.
9198392	9203694	The first is going to be, I think, what concept should we go ahead... Because I can make anything.
9203774	9205414	So what are we going to make...
9206694	9212436	I'll come up with a couple ideas and maybe people vote on it and we'll go from there and later on as we get more into it.
9212956	9218518	And hell, I don't know if I'll actually create a game in 24 hours because I've never made anything before, but I think I can do it.
9218558	9220139	I love how you're doing your game jams.
9220219	9223500	I've never made a game before, but I'm pretty sure I can do one in 24 hours.
9223520	9223880	Maybe.
9224140	9225940	I don't know.
9225980	9226541	We'll try it.
9226601	9229982	I mean, hell, I've watched a video where someone made a game in three minutes.
9230022	9231062	I mean, it can be done.
9231122	9232823	Is it going to be a good game?
9232843	9233863	Maybe.
9234083	9234303	Maybe.
9234840	9240628	It's like the noob night that Bobby and I keep talking about for Borderlands 2, except your noob night is programming.
9241088	9242190	Yeah, I think it'd be fun.
9242370	9243551	I kind of want to do it.
9243592	9246395	So yeah, as Bobby suggested, make a poll on the forum.
9246415	9250080	So yeah, I'll start off with doing that, and we'll do updates in there and stuff.
9251241	9253002	See where it goes, because I think it'd be fun.
9253102	9255062	I think you should try to make one of the OLR Dream games.
9255082	9256603	No, no, see, I knew you would say that.
9256803	9259203	I knew you would say that, but here's why I don't want to do that.
9259223	9261384	Because if I'm going to make one of those, it's got to be a good game.
9261524	9264485	I don't want to make my first experiment at something that's going to suck.
9265625	9268066	One of those games, no offense.
9268126	9270987	I'd rather do it when I'm able to make something a little bit better.
9272007	9272948	It's a dream game after all.
9272968	9275349	We're not going to just crap out something.
9275749	9276210	Fair enough.
9276270	9279071	You want to make sure that the time is taken to get it right.
9279091	9282013	Besides, I have a lot of really crazy ideas for things.
9282093	9284554	I mean, all sorts of silly things.
9285395	9288617	All right, let me quickly go to some tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
9289697	9290978	Looking at a few tweets here.
9291779	9297522	SS2100Matt tweeted us about going to EA's NHL 94 anniversary mode party in New York City.
9298022	9303786	and he actually took some footage that he posted over on Facebook and yeah, I saw that earlier in the week and it looks pretty cool.
9304146	9317394	I like how they put that mode in there to kind of, you know, with the stars under the player and all that to kind of go back to the classic and I heard EA didn't really like him taking some of that footage but I'm glad his rogue footage made it to Facebook after all.
9318334	9319755	TigerClaw is sending us a couple tweets.
9320536	9323277	Oculus Rift is planned for PC and mobile but consoles?
9323397	9324138	Not a focus.
9324158	9324558	What?
9324798	9331665	Which I suppose would go a ways in... Wasn't there some rumor about PlayStation 4 getting Oculus Rift at some point?
9331705	9334087	I want to say right around E3 there was some wank on that.
9334227	9336109	Honestly, it can support any platform.
9336169	9338111	It's just... It's HDMI inputs.
9338352	9343797	It's basically... It just has to output that display and it can work with pretty much anything.
9343917	9346540	So... Well, actually, no.
9346560	9347060	I take that back.
9347100	9348662	It's a little bit more complex than that, but...
9349042	9351704	Yeah, I think they said consoles at one time.
9352244	9357488	Obviously, if it has native support for Unreal 4, both consoles can run that.
9358449	9364373	And Source... I'm not really sure what other engines are going to be supporting it natively, but...
9364993	9366735	and more and more are supporting it.
9366795	9367996	So I wouldn't see why not.
9368356	9368616	All right.
9369437	9373960	Also, Tiger Claw letting us know that a new side-scrolling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game is coming in October.
9375641	9377363	Activision talked about this in a press release.
9377423	9379665	It's based on the Nickelodeon version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
9379685	9380945	You know they're doing a new movie, right?
9381186	9381706	Yeah, I knew that.
9381726	9382587	With Megan Fox.
9383621	9384602	Yeah, I heard about that.
9386344	9386784	Pass.
9388386	9394832	Also, lastly, Spazinator on Twitter wants to know, after the show's over, anyone up for a game of Left 4 Dead 2?
9395633	9397294	Or if not Left 4 Dead 2, then Civ 4.
9398058	9399419	I'm up for a game of driving home
9418667	9421609	Go meet Raginator, Spazinator, whatever he's called.
9421909	9424750	Go meet him in our VOG Network group and get a game going.
9425210	9427251	He wants to kill some zombies with you.
9427752	9428192	Have fun.
9429192	9429493	All right.
9430133	9432374	Well, I guess that's going to do it for our Skype line tonight.
9433234	9436156	And I guess it's going to start to do it for the end of our show.
9436576	9438377	It's starting to get really hot in here, you guys.
9438877	9444080	It's been a hot day in Sacramento, and then we're running the oven right now because I guess Alan started dinner, so it's like...
9444440	9444940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9471269	9498213	I wonder how long it's going to take me to get all those gummy bears My final thought is I'm going to need to really convince myself not to buy Rogue Legacy while it's at least 20% off during the Steam sale and I was holding out for a deeper discount or else I'm probably going to end up buying that later tonight because I do want to get that I've heard a lot of good things about it
9499212	9499572	Damn it.
9500273	9501373	Damn you, Steam Sale.
9501533	9502714	You should have gotten Little Inferno.
9503134	9503654	Damn you.
9503894	9504395	Or do you have it?
9504615	9505295	I still might.
9505395	9505975	You never know.
9506015	9506916	It's fun, Rob.
9507916	9513119	All right, well, good luck to all of you and try not to spend too much money on video games.
9513159	9514660	Don't forget to pay your mortgage or your rent.
