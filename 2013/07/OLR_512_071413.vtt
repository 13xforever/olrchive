Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this, episode 512, July the 14th of 2013.

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
How you guys doing out there? Live at live.vognetwork.com. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

00:53.000 --> 01:03.000
And we always love it when you can come out and participate live with the show, but if you're listening on the podcast feed, be it through iTunes, through Stitcher, through whatever it is you use to listen to podcasts, a big thank you to you guys as well.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
Always appreciate your support of indie podcasting. So let's talk about games. My name is Rob Roberts and we'll talk games tonight with DarkSakura.

01:10.000 --> 01:19.000
Me. How are you? Me. Me? Oh, you're MII because you have your 3DS open right now. Yeah, I actually feel like I've been to the gym.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah? Because like I walked around all day yesterday, which I'm sure we'll get to, but like my butt hurts like I've been on the elliptical. That's hot.

01:29.000 --> 01:41.000
Everyone knows the elliptical butt hurt, I'm hoping. And if not, then imagine walking uphill for a long time. And that's the elliptical butt hurt as well. I am literally butt hurt.

01:41.000 --> 01:49.000
The show hasn't even started. Is your butt nice and firm DarkSakura? And speak slowly when you respond.

01:49.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah. Also say hello to, and I don't know how firm his butt is, but let's say hi to tech master Loki. Hi. How are you doing?

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
Doing fine. Probably not that firm when you get two cheeseburgers at McDonald's, but today you have Subway. You go in the Jared diet or what's up with this?

02:08.000 --> 02:19.000
No, no diet. I just got sick of eating cheeseburgers. It's fair. I've actually been trying to eat better. I've been doing like more salads at work. Like I don't like go out and get fast food.

02:19.000 --> 02:32.000
How are you liking the candy bar? Shut up. I was going to get to that. I do have Friday as a cheat day and I was like, ah, I can't even like like chicken McNuggets don't even sound good. So I think that's a good thing. Right? Like when the really bad food starts to like so bad.

02:33.000 --> 02:49.000
But then DarkSakura, this bitch shows up and brings candy bars to the show and not, they're not just any candy bars. They're crunch bars with girl scout cookie mix or something in them. Cause basically she brought me Samoas. Basically candy bar form.

02:49.000 --> 02:58.000
But if you read the label, they are less bad for you than a serving of Samoas. Oh cool. The entire package is 190 calories. Cool. Can I have two? Yes, you can have two.

02:59.000 --> 03:12.000
Bitch, if you want to eat it, then sure. I will just do some butt firming. Just dance for after the show too. Oh my God. I had the worst Mongolian barbecue last night. Never go to Sue's Mongolian barbecue in Santa Clara.

03:12.000 --> 03:26.000
Oh, okay. Girl, first mistake. You went to Mongolian barbecue in the Bay area. No. Yet to find a good place. No. Dance said that they had a really good place that they went to last year. Okay. And so we thought we were going there, but they went to a different place and it was nasty.

03:26.000 --> 03:36.000
But I mean they had some really good orange chicken that wasn't hot. It was more like sweet and sour orangey chicken and it was pretty good, but I got so sick and then I had to go drink to forget about it.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
It was so bad that I had to, I had to drink and then I played drunk 2DX, which was great.

03:43.000 --> 03:54.000
Look, I want to introduce a guest that doesn't drive us to drink out of anger, but we might have a drink with him because he's a good friend of the show and he's, he's been here on and off for really the past 12 years.

03:54.000 --> 04:07.000
Hopefully you recognize this name, even though he hasn't been here in a while. Say hello. Welcome back. Bradley is here. Hello. How's it going? Arkadian42, if you rather. Yes. Is that still your screen name all these years later? Yes, it is. Awesome. Still going that way.

04:07.000 --> 04:19.000
Howdy. How you doing? I'm doing okay. What's new with you? Catch us up on the past year since you've been on the show. Well, it was about six months ago. Okay, six months ago. I haven't done too much different. I went to California Extreme and I saw Dan, but I didn't see Jamie at all.

04:19.000 --> 04:35.000
So I was actually hanging out in the Bamani Corner for quite a while and then I hung up playing Metallica for quite a while. Yeah, I played that one. Did you get to play it? Yeah, I played it a few times. Did you get to play Wizard of Oz? No, I saw it, but I didn't have time. Did you see like the horde around Wizard of Oz? I got to touch it.

04:35.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah, there was a fair number of people and I kind of looked at it and watched someone playing it right before I left. I have a video of the gameplay and I was planning on posting it tonight and reposting it to the Orange Lounge Tumblr.

04:47.000 --> 04:59.000
Alright, we got to back up a minute here because I wanted to talk about this at the start of the show anyway. You guys, both you guys, I didn't get to go, Logie didn't go. You guys are both at this thing that they do in the Bay Area every year called California Extreme, right? It was quite extreme.

04:59.000 --> 05:17.000
So what, for those that don't know, because they do have an international audience, what is California Extreme? California Extreme is basically a bunch of pinball tables and a bunch of classic arcade games and a couple of new ones here and there. Like I said, there was a 2DX and a couple of DDRs and a BeatMania 3.

05:17.000 --> 05:34.000
And also it's where a lot of pinball vendors, which the number is kind of dwindling now, but parts vendors will come. You know, people sell like, I almost bought a Bionic Woman lunchbox like from when I was an infant. I was so close. So anyway, it's just a big...

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
And lunchbox.

05:35.000 --> 05:53.000
No, no I didn't. I ended up not. And people, there's documentaries they do there. They do panels. Like we went to this one that was called Galaxy Game where they were talking about the old space fight game and how they programmed it and how much a computer cost in 1971. $13,000.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, it was expensive.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
It talks about having 8K of RAM and how wonderful it was.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
It was just a really neat event, you know, and I ran into like tons of people I know that I never see.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
So it's like a celebration of classic gaming with like a splash of modern gaming.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
It's basically if Bobby Black Wolf Show were an expo, right?

06:15.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, it's also, you know, all these games are on free play on top of it. And it's, Stern comes out every year and brings like their top new tables. And so there was like an Avengers there. There was an X-Men. There was ACDC. There was the new Metallica table with all the three different types of back glass on it.

06:36.000 --> 06:55.000
And it was just really a lot of fun. And of course, man, I feel so bad because the guy who owns this Big Bang bar, actually no, he I think sold it to the convention finally, a Big Bang bar prototype, which was like one of Capcom's last tables they produced.

06:56.000 --> 07:09.000
It's really beat. It's in rotten shape. It needs to be shopped. But the thing now is that you can get repro parts for it because they've actually there's a person reproducing the Big Bang bar table and kingpin. They had a kingpin there, too.

07:09.000 --> 07:19.000
And then there were like the Gottlieb tables that were all like Miami Heat instead of Miami Vice and Raven instead of Rambo. You know, all these little knockoff titles because they couldn't get licensing.

07:20.000 --> 07:33.000
And, you know, Data East tables that are always kind of between cheeseball and awesome. There's the Super Mario mushroom world there. You know, I love that one. Yeah. And it was broken when I tried to play it. And then all these other people who are taller than me were trying to play like, dude, I'm actually the right size.

07:33.000 --> 07:47.000
And then there was this game that had like it's like called Alley Cat or something that had trash cans and they lift up. It's a little kid's ball game. Oh, yeah. Melody and I were there, got on our knees and we're just throwing balls and balls and balls and balls at it.

07:47.000 --> 08:01.000
So you got on your knees and we're playing with balls and cats, balls and pussy. Okay. Just just make it sure we're all busy. All right. Good times. Bradley, were you on your knees playing with balls at some point? Oh, not really your thing.

08:02.000 --> 08:20.000
I didn't go on these, but I did play that little the Super Mario one, the small title. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Because like Mario had like a kid's table and an adult table. Right. Yeah. Because they were right next to each other. They did have one that was on adult size legs. Yeah. But it was just to display the LEDs.

08:21.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay. That might have been something different, but there was two next to the little one and the other one. I know because one of them does the I don't know the complete name of it, but it's one that I had like there was an arcade near my high school that had it.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
We're not an arcade. Actually, Ice Rink had it and I went there and played it every so often. Oh, it's a good fun one.

08:38.000 --> 08:54.000
Um, I was just gonna say about California extreme. It's not really just the games either. You because you run into a lot of people. Right. Which is what ticks me off. Why I couldn't go because you ran into like tons of people blast from the past from the DDR days. Right. Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah. Like, uh, ran into, uh, Richard ran into, uh, sell Chris Tang, which you see Chris Tang at every event that has the money. Um, uh, ran into, uh, Ali, I ran into, um, Wendell, of course.

09:08.000 --> 09:19.000
And, uh, Chris from DDR freak back in the day, he actually arrived late at night. Like I'm in the middle of playing the song and then I end the song. Next thing I know, I'm like in this bear hug. It was awesome. That's cool.

09:19.000 --> 09:36.000
So it was kind of like a little mini con. Yeah, pretty much. And then it's a lot of, you know, because a lot of us who, you know, started off back in the day, we're all grown up. So we were going out, you know, drinking in the, cause there's like a little bar in the front of the Hyatt and you know, $15 lemon drop.

09:37.000 --> 09:52.000
So we're actually out there having our adult fruit, fruit drinks and talking about games. Is it more of an adult convention? Like I'm not talking, there was some kids there, but a lot of people, you know, there was, there was some teenagers, there were some little kids there, but a lot of people really were just older gamers.

09:53.000 --> 10:04.000
I bet a lot of those were like people bringing their kids too, or like they were bringing themselves and brought their kids. There were a few. Yeah. Like I actually met a guy from Folsom who has like a pretty sizable private collection and he brought his daughter.

10:04.000 --> 10:16.000
Nice. We actually ended up hanging out at a table just chatting about collections versus buying a house. Cause that's what Dan and I were trying to do. Did you get more listeners for VOG while you were there? I did pimp us out.

10:16.000 --> 10:26.000
Okay, good. And there's some people I'm sorry, I've forgotten to put you, uh, uh, on my Facebook, but hi, it was great to meet you. And I met a friend of Kyle Snyder.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
What the hell has he been doing? I'm sorry. No idea, but I said I'd give him a shout out. So hi.

10:31.000 --> 10:46.000
I know like we have like more listeners now than we did back in the DDR day. And like none of you people know who Kyle Snyder was, but for those that do epic freestyle and he actually what didn't he debut a single here on this show like years ago.

10:46.000 --> 10:55.000
And I've always wondered what happened to that kid. I'm not even kidding. Like, Oh God, no, it was one of the best of the dark Tetsuya put together, had his premiere in it.

10:55.000 --> 11:05.000
And I was listening to like, yes, I was listening to my own show while I was driving to Disneyland cause I'm such a narcissist. Well, no, I, I, I wanted to hear the best of the dark Tetsuya put together.

11:05.000 --> 11:20.000
And I heard the Kyle Snyder segment and I was like, what happened to that kid? What happened? I mean, he's gotta be like 30 now, right? Maybe if I'm 35, that guy's gotta be 30 last I heard, you know, he went on his Mormon mission and that's, you know, that's a two year commitment.

11:21.000 --> 11:42.000
So people sometimes disappear after that. So amazing. I just thought it was, you know, pretty, uh, pretty interesting, you know, running into people who knew people that I knew and, you know, especially, and I spent all day on my, uh, my, uh, DS checking where I tagged people from and running into people who screen names.

11:42.000 --> 11:54.000
I recognize and like going, I want to send them a message, find me shit, you know, but yeah, you should be able to like add friends from that or at least, or at least like send a message.

11:54.000 --> 12:06.000
You know, I wanted to, I actually did tag him twice and I could have sent him a message, but it was toward the end of the night and he wouldn't have gotten my message. So whatever you're having fun with your three DS. This is only the second week you've had it.

12:06.000 --> 12:24.000
I swear everybody. Oh yeah, I have, I'm already, I've already got, let's see, I've expanded my house. I bought my house, expanded it twice, bought my upstairs, expanded it once and I have my basement now. I'm paying for my dream suites. I'm getting club lol and Blathers wants to expand my, uh, my museum.

12:24.000 --> 12:39.000
You're, you're on it and animal crossing. Fuck yeah. Awesome. It's cause I go to the island and pick fruit instead of doing the little, uh, games and then go sell my fruit and then I do it like five times in a day. That's how to do it. That's how to do it. I'm making money. It's 80 style.

12:39.000 --> 12:52.000
All right, let me go back to Bradley, our guest Bradley. You had fun at California stream. Were you there Friday and Saturday or just Saturday or no, just Saturday. There's a Saturday Sunday convention. So why don't I think it was three days? I thought it was just to gotcha.

12:52.000 --> 13:05.000
Um, what, what, what kinds of games you've been playing the past year or six months you beaten anything lately or, uh, rogue, rogue Alexi was the last thing I beat. That was a pretty cool game. Bobby was just talking about that on his show.

13:05.000 --> 13:17.000
That's the one where like it's the Metroid Castlevania game where you play descendants of the hero. Yeah. So basically you go through the castle and you're collecting, basically you're collecting money as you go through it and then trying to beat the bosses and stuff.

13:17.000 --> 13:29.000
And, uh, as you get more money and once you, you die after a while, cause it's, the enemies are kind of hard and it's easy to, to all the spikes and all that kind of stuff. So once you die, you basically build up your castle.

13:29.000 --> 13:46.000
Basically, uh, as you upgrade, you get different options and, uh, you get new options for what children can be and like runes and things like that to basically expand your gameplay and help you along, get you more HP, more MP and, and other, other options like that.

13:46.000 --> 13:57.000
And then then you keep trying over and over again for hundreds of times. Um, yeah, I saw this game on steam and I wanted to get it, but it is not part of the, and we'll obviously have to talk about this.

13:57.000 --> 14:05.000
The steam sale going on right now, which has many people's attentions, but it's still worth it outside the, the lack of sale price, right?

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
Yeah. Actually I did see it on sale for like $2 off or something like that. Not, not too big of a deal, but.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Well that's something.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah. So I bought it at $15 and that's well worth the price.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
That's no like Tomb Raider for 12 bucks or Borderlands 2 for 10, but that's, that's still a pretty good deal.

14:20.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah. And you can play this for hours and hours. Some people can beat it pretty fast. That took me like 22 hours just cause I took a lot of time exploring the castle each time and didn't try to kill the bosses really early.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
So, and then there's new fame plus and you can just keep going and going as much as you want.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Nice. That sounds like a fun time.

14:38.000 --> 14:53.000
Another big game was playing Animal Crossing. I've been playing that shit loads. Basically I'm already up to 85 hours in the game. Like man, it just takes so much time. There's so many different things to do. Like it takes like two hours a day to, to when you're starting out.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
That's all?

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah. Well, I've spent more than that. Like on the Island days, if you go to Island.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
I fell off the wagon y'all. I stopped playing Animal Crossing. I just couldn't take that investment anymore. I'm just like, it's too much. I have to do it every day.

15:06.000 --> 15:18.000
And part of it too is that it's a slow process. Like if I could just open up my 3DS and be in my town, yay, I'd be there. But it's like, you got to open it up, load the game, wait for the game, wait for the thing to load your town.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
Then you got to make sure you save and quit. Are you going to get Mr. Aceti? It's just kind of like, it takes too fucking long to get in there.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
True.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
No, I don't think so.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I do.

15:26.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah. But it is a lot of time investment to do a bunch of things. Yeah. And basically the, the message boards I go at, we're basically have loads of front people that are messing each other and getting, swapping items and all that stuff.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Okay.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
So basically I've gotten a lot of stuff.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Well, nice.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Almost done with the house.

15:45.000 --> 15:53.000
Well, you will get my small pitiful house in your, in Plaza now since we, I see the green light on my 3DS. So there you go.

15:53.000 --> 16:01.000
And other games, FTL was a big game that I played a lot of, and I played that this week, uh, to, for the trading card thing.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And you got sucked into that trading card thing too?

16:03.000 --> 16:22.000
I don't know. I don't know about the trading yet, actually doing the trading cause that seems like a ton of annoyingness, but I did play that and a bit of Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy, and haven't played too many other games that were in that thing that this trading card so far.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Well, they're adding new ones every day.

16:24.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah. Cause I probably go play, I want to pay Portal and Portal 2 again to, cause I haven't played them on Steam yet, so I could see them in other than 720p and watch them in 1080 or however good they are on, for the Steam version.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
So I might do that pretty soon.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Awesome.

16:41.000 --> 16:52.000
And another big thing right now is those new, the new Meat Plaza games. Basically they just released those last week, and you can basically get the bundle for 15 bucks of all four of them.

16:52.000 --> 17:09.000
And basically, I think at the right, at the beginning, near the beginning of, of, of Extreme, the California Extreme yesterday, I almost spent an hour standing off right near the entrance doing the updates for those, or doing the, doing those games.

17:09.000 --> 17:17.000
Doing, cause basically you can, for each new game you can take all the 10 tags that you have and take them through each game. So that takes a lot.

17:17.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah, that's not for convention play. You know what I mean? Like that's just too many people. Like, but that's, for, for when you occasionally street pass on people, I think that's a good, good thing to do.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
They need to let you hold more than 10 people in the buffer though.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
That would be nice.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
That would be nice. For conventions.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Yeah, that was annoying cause then I think I'd be done and then like, nope, more people.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Imagine when I was at E3.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Oh yeah. I'm just waiting until my next Disneyland trip.

17:42.000 --> 17:55.000
Disneyland's not as bad. I mean, you will fill it up partway through the day. So you want to check a couple of times a day and it's going to be harder with these four new games because now it's like, now I got to play this, the fantasy zone game.

17:55.000 --> 18:09.000
Now I got to play the kingdom game and whatever. It's, it's a lot. So I think, I think I kind of have to pick my battles and which, which game do I really want to progress on the most? And for me, that's the puzzle trading to get the little 3d pictures.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
I did finish two puzzles.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Did you? Congrats.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Good.

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah. They just opened up two new ones right when I was like, I was within like 40 pieces of having everything and now two new puzzles.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Just these four new puzzles.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Bastard. Really?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yes.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Oh my God.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Jerks.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
All right. Fair enough.

18:28.000 --> 18:36.000
Um, well, I guess I've been blurring the line here a little bit between trying to interview Bradley and getting to our gaming weeks, but one thing I wanted to bring up was steam sale.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I'm sure you guys listening to this show can't avoid it.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
What is it about the steam sale that gets everybody in the gaming community talking?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I guess it's probably them prices, right?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
The fact that, uh, you know, what is it today right now?

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Tomb Raider as of the taping of the show, 12 bucks.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Actually, that was yesterday's deal, but they, they last for 48 hours, right?

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
Uh, borderlands two for $10 and the season pass another $10 a really cheap stuff.

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
And then of course, valve trying to sweeten the pot a little bit by this whole new thing with the trading cards.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
And now they've incorporated that into the sale where you get trading cards for voting, which Ooh, it's after six o'clock.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
I got to go vote on what game is next. Get my, I'll do my later.

19:18.000 --> 19:25.000
But, uh, yeah, they get the cards through that or by spending money or by crafting badges.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
Thank you, Loki. He gave me the two cards I was missing in the super meat boy set.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And I crafted my first badge before the show.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
And I got, uh, I got a summer sale card for crafting it now.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
And I got my little emoticon that's deal with it with the super meat boy shades.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
And I got the doctor fetus background with the big middle finger for my profile.

19:47.000 --> 19:54.000
So that's kind of awesome. So if you visit my profile, well, I haven't changed it yet, but I will, but, uh, I will be flipping you off on my steam profile.

19:54.000 --> 20:04.000
But I wanted to say, if you are getting into the trading card whoring thing for no explainable reason, like myself, uh, visit vognetwork.com and check out the forums.

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
I have posted an official steam trading card for him there because not only did I trade with Loki, I think I traded with Rababa the other day.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
You know, I'm starting to trade with other people, but I would like to help out vog listeners.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
I'll go to the general steam trade community if I must, but I'd rather help the vog people get the cards they need first.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
So I only have a couple extras right now, but if I have something you want, let's talk.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Uh, cause now what do I need? I'm two cards short on really big skies.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
So if you have, if you have the cards for that, help me out.

20:33.000 --> 20:41.000
Uh, Alan Alchemy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says the trading cards are neat, but I'm annoyed at their integration into the sale.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
They already had a great meta game for sales that worked and did more to enrich and create content for the community in my opinion.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
Like write, write a recommendation for a game you own, post screenshots and so on.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
Um, yeah, you know, steam did kind of generalize that into a community badge.

20:59.000 --> 21:07.000
So it's there, but yeah, I liked, I did like how you'd kind of get the perks every few months when they did these big sales, the summer sale and the winter sale.

21:07.000 --> 21:16.000
Like I, I do kind of miss that a little bit because the kind of homogenizing it all into just the general community badge is going to make the sales lose that little special end of it.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
But the trading cards is something, but I draw the line at spending real money.

21:21.000 --> 21:29.000
I won't, I won't, I promise I won't, but I will probably end up with Borderlands 2 cause Bobby got Borderlands 2.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
I'll play.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
And you've got Borderlands 2.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
I do and I haven't played it yet.

21:32.000 --> 21:40.000
Loki has Borderlands 2. That's four people to all play some co-op on live streaming. What do you think? What do you think Dark Soccer? What do you think?

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Alright, I get the thumbs up in the other room.

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
Alright, let's get into our other gaming weeks and the other types of games that you've been playing this week.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I do not leave trash all over your table, hello.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Oh, I appreciate that.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
I was throwing it away like a responsible adult.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
You gotta do something responsible.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
You could have just put it in the bowl with this trash cause I gotta go throw that out anyway.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
You know what? My trash is separate.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
You have to separate our trash? I understand.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I don't want my trash to get gay.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm kidding. Shame on you.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Alright.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I will throw away your trash.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Oh, you don't have to do that.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I'm up.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Aw, shucks. Thanks.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Well then, since Dark Soccer's walking away, let me check in with Bradley.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
I know you kinda already gave us the rundown on what you've been playing lately, but is there any other games you wanna talk about during your gaming week?

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
Oh, let's see. I don't know if there was anything else that I didn't mention.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Okay. That's alright. I figured you probably got out what you were currently playing in there.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Well, Jamie's back, so let me ask Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Fuck. Busy.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
I played a lot of BeatMania 2DX. I got to try a lot of new songs, some of which I passed the first time through.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
I was playing on standard, so, you know, easy mode.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
I passed Star Mine.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
Ain't no shame in that. You're in your mid-thirties now. You get to tone it down a bit.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
I haven't touched it since we last had one, and what did we have last? A red?

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
It actually had the DJ Troopers banner on it, but it was a trichoro.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
I got to play a lot of fun stuff. I played some BeatMania 3.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
Going from 2DX to BeatMania 3, the timing is just freakin' bizarre, you know?

23:12.000 --> 23:19.000
So anyway, I played Quartet, which I was super disappointed that I couldn't hear the music.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
Our fortune cookie reflects the music because I wanna freakin' hear that song.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
I also played... I didn't play Journey because there was someone on it every time.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I played a lot of Metallica Pinball. It's super good.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
It's funny with me and three other people behind me singing Master of Puppets while I'm playing the game.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Because I can't help it, you know?

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
Master of Puppets is just one of those songs that you have to sing along with certain parts of it if you know the song.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
And I love old Metallica.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
Also, one of our friends that drove us down there, he has a limited edition Metallica.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
He buys everything that Stern puts out new.

24:03.000 --> 24:10.000
And he got it signed by... I think the artist's name was Dirty Donny, I think.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
He just ran into him and got him to sign it. So that was cool.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
I know I played a bunch of other stuff.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.000
I did play some Little Inferno as far as not classic stuff.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I pretty much played a ton of different games.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
I played Timber with Melody. That was fun.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
And then we threw our balls at some pussies. And it was pretty fun too.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
I also played ACDC Pinball. I played Big Bang Bar.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I played The Wizard of Oz Pinball.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
I got some footage of it that I'm going to be putting on my Tumblr and reposting to the Orange Lounge Tumblr later tonight.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Including the rainbow mode. Rob, it's so cool.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
It's like they've got multicolored LEDs in the play field.

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
So that they'll cycle through different colors over each area instead of just having the standard incandescence of the older tables.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
It's pretty neat.

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
So yeah, I won't go too much into the classic stuff because, like I said, there's a bunch of it there and I played a bunch of it.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
I played a lot of Animal Crossing, like I said.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Little Inferno, I finally put down the two bucks to get Little Inferno on Steam.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
It's freaking fun.

25:29.000 --> 25:41.000
And the art style is like Edward Gorey and Joan M. Vasquez and Tim Burton all got put into a blender and their art style came out into this.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
It was pretty neat.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
And it's kind of just a creepy game, but basically what happens in that game is that you get a fireplace.

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
And you just burn stuff. And you can earn money the more that you burn things and buy different things out of catalogs.

25:57.000 --> 26:05.000
And as you get different combos of stuff, you unlock more catalog and you have to use up your catalog before you can get a new catalog.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
And you have to make 99 different combos of stuff.

26:09.000 --> 26:19.000
And some of them are kind of hard because for one that's one of the last ones in there, you have to combine the sun and Pluto and the moon.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
And it's called the solar system combo.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
But when you put Pluto in there, it freezes everything. But when you put the sun in there, it burns everything.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
And it lasts for a long time, so you actually have to wait until your fireplace is completely empty.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
Put in Pluto and then put in the sun and then the moon. And then it'll do everything.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
You get like ice cubes. There's one that's called the well-medicated combo that's like wine and happy pills and stuff.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
That one's pretty funny. And the wine is called the midlife crisis mitigator.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
What game is this still? Little Inferno?

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
Little Inferno. And then when you get past that, and to anyone who hasn't played it before that's going to,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
remember what items that you send to your neighbor.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Because those are the items for the final combo.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Which I had to go back and look them all up again because I forgot what I sent.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
After that, though, you have like a little adventure part of the game. You know, kind of a point-and-clicky sort of thing.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
And I just started that, so I'm going to probably be playing more of that one tomorrow.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
And I actually have not played any Mass Effect for an entire week.

27:17.000 --> 27:30.000
Oh my god! What is the date? July 14th, episode 512. The one where she didn't play Mass Effect all week long. Holy shit.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
Rob, in my defense, I've been looking for houses and I didn't play live on Thursday because of the stupid cough.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
So you know what? I'm allowed to take a vacation.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
I just, Commander Shepard is shedding a single tear.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
Sometimes people in relationships need to take some time off from each other.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
Allowed to take a vacation. That is something a pod person would say.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
Anyway, I did buy a few more games on Steam, but I forgot what they were because I'm probably going to buy more tonight.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
But I was going to get FTL, but it just doesn't seem like my kind of game.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
Oh, I did get Hotline Miami and the Download Pack.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
And I haven't tried it yet, but it just looks like it's so much fun because I like going around in a virtual environment.

28:20.000 --> 28:27.000
A safe virtual environment where there's no risk that I'm actually going to do anything like this in real life and kill a bunch of people.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
And big bloody massacres with a neat soundtrack.

28:31.000 --> 28:38.000
It's not like I'm going to plug in my iPhone and listen to some dead mouse and shoot up a mall. Not going to happen.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Not going to happen.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Only in game.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Only in a game.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
I didn't really play a whole ton of this stuff because I was doing all sorts of weird things.

28:49.000 --> 28:57.000
Like I was modding my laptop cooling tray because I was trying to play Super Meat Boy on Sunday and my laptop got really hot.

28:57.000 --> 29:05.000
My laptops with dedicated graphics cards, they tend to get warm because graphics cards aren't meant to be shoved into a laptop.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
So I figured I needed a little bit more than just the really cheap blower fans that they had on there.

29:12.000 --> 29:21.000
So I crafted a thing using basically the parts I had from my PC and my laptop cooling tray.

29:21.000 --> 29:31.000
So after cutting some of the plastic around and stuff, I screwed in two 120mm fans in there that are from my Antec case.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
So they have the three speed settings.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
And of course you need a dedicated 12 volt power supply so I have a separate plug in the wall now.

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
And I had to manufacture a super long molex cable to connect to it.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
So I have that now.

29:47.000 --> 30:00.000
It works okay except I need new fan grills on it because the ones I made out of some office mesh stuff, office supply trays and stuff, they kind of bend too much.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
And so occasionally if it's sitting weird in my lap you'll hear it scrape against the fan blades.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
But it keeps it cool, that's for sure.

30:08.000 --> 30:14.000
So let's see, aside from that I played Super Meat Boy. I actually played through quite a bit of it.

30:14.000 --> 30:27.000
And then I have been staring at a lot of the Steam sales stuff but so far I'm showing much restraint and not picking up Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition for $5.

30:27.000 --> 30:34.000
Because I know that a game like that, like Skyrim, is going to take hundreds of hours to sink in there.

30:34.000 --> 30:47.000
And it'll be a fun hundred hours or so but with Saints Row 4 around the corner and Grand Theft Auto 5 in a couple months I really have to plan my gaming because Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to encompass my entire life after Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
So yeah, so I'm not picking that up yet.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Although tomorrow that's another thing.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
That gameplay trailer which I haven't seen yet.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
So amazing.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
How'd you feel about that?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Oh it was great.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Yeah?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
It was fantastic.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
What'd you think of it?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
We talked about it on Hoard House this week.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
I guess there's a teaser at the end about a Grand Theft Auto Online?

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Well it's just what they're calling their online portion of the game.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
Because there's an online portion to Grand Theft Auto 4 but now they're calling it Grand Theft Auto Online.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
And it looks great.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
I mean it looks really good.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
Obviously the screenshots that they've been putting out aren't the same quality as the gameplay trailer.

31:27.000 --> 31:37.000
But that just leads to the rumors that yeah they're producing a higher quality asset version of the game so they can be ported to the PC or next gen consoles when the time comes.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
Just so y'all know, Loki told me before the show tonight, you will get Grand Theft Auto 5 and you will play it.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
Like it was not unique to us. You will.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
Well because you have Grand Theft Auto 4 and you still haven't played it.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Alan played it on PC.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
That's Alan playing it. I'm not talking about Alan. I'm talking about you playing it.

31:54.000 --> 32:03.000
Honestly though, you probably should just skip 4 at this point and just go straight into 5 because it's going to be way better anyways.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
I don't know. Just everything looks great about it.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Like the gameplay looks tighter. The combat looks better.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
The level of detail in the game is just ridiculous.

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
And it just looks fun. It looks like a game that I can sink hundreds of hours into.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
And let's not kid ourselves. You will.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
I will.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
That game will cause disagreements between you and the wife.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
No, no it won't because I will.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
The only problem is going to be getting this scream to play that on.

32:35.000 --> 32:42.000
I guess I could play it in the other room but I can because my Xbox 360 has WiFi so that will be just fine.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
There you go.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
I can play in the other room.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Problem solved.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Exactly.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
No, not really. I'm just getting ready.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
I was installing Arma 2 and the expansion DayZ.

32:54.000 --> 33:03.000
Actually, because Gali had sent me a message on Twitter saying that he has a DayZ breakpoint server.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
So maybe we can do that in the future.

33:07.000 --> 33:13.000
VOG game night. Although for now I'm just suspending VOG game night because it's hard to get everybody together.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
It's just to think of games to play.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.000
It's really difficult, especially since on Fridays, usually Josh is going to bed later.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
So I'm getting on at 9 and it's not a whole ton of time to play.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Focus on building our online communities for now and then we can look into doing something like that again.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
The good thing though, there is one good gaming thing that did happen this week.

33:38.000 --> 33:46.000
By some miracle, they fixed our Minecraft server long enough for me to download the backup of it.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
So I made a backup and downloaded the world. So we still have the world intact now.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
So my plan is when I do eventually get around to actually...

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
Aww, that's just fantastic. Brad, you're awesome.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.000
So Brad from Pod Culture sent me a copy of Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Oh, shut up. Right now?

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Yeah, it's awesome. Thank you.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
Brad, you are too good to us. That man sends us booze. He sends us games.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Brad, you're the man. He's awesome.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
And he sends me episodes of Doctor Who.

34:19.000 --> 34:24.000
What else does a nerd need besides games, Doctor Who, and booze?

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Coffee!

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Coffee.

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
Brad, you're right. Everybody listen to Pod Culture. 6 o'clock Pacific, Monday nights here at VOG.

34:34.000 --> 34:41.000
So anyways, the plan is what I'm going to do with it once I get around to actually setting up that Minecraft server with mods and stuff.

34:41.000 --> 34:50.000
I'm going to do a multi-world server where you can travel between the server that Gali has set up right now, which I think is a survival server.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
So I'm just going to leave that alone. And then ours, which is a creative server.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
So you'll be able to go back and forth between that stuff and I think it'll be the best of both worlds there.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
I don't want to ruin the mood, but don't download that while the show's going.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
No, of course not. Come on, man.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
Let's see. Oh, going to the chat room. It's almost like it's a list list going on here.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
What else does a nerd need besides Doctor Who, liquor, and games?

35:14.000 --> 35:22.000
SSJ100Matt says boobs. You know, I'm a gay male and I'm not going to disagree with that. I need boobs too.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
You know what? Sometimes boobs get in the way.

35:24.000 --> 35:31.000
I will cosign that to the list. Fifth Dream says masturbation. No comment.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Misty says Mountain Dew. I don't know.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
No. Nasty shit.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Maybe beverage of some type.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Coffee.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Okay. Coffee.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Coffee.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
So a caffeinated beverage of some sort.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
I will let caffeinated beverages go, except Mountain Dew is nasty shit.

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
Which, by the way, Rob, I have to say something, speaking of nerd drinks.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Do you remember a soda called Josta?

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Oh God, yes. It sounds familiar for some reason.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
It was like this golden colored drink and it had a red and black label with a panther on it.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
It was put out by Pepsi, but Pepsi never put their logo on the label.

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
And it went off the market fairly quickly. Josta was really good.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
And somebody brought a 15 year old can of it. Oh, I do remember this.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Somebody brought a 15 year old can of it to a California extreme and you drank it.

36:19.000 --> 36:26.000
No. I found a soda at the Russian market that tastes almost exactly like it. It's a Brazilian guarana soda.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
That is the most random thing you've ever said on this show.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
But Josta was made out of guarana.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
Hey y'all, remember Josta? Well you can get it at the Russian grocery store.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
Keep in mind, keep in mind, I used to drink this stuff and watch Sailor Moon marathons.

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
Josta is the official drink of my Sailor Moon marathons, so you can stop laughing at me.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
Alright, so let me just add that to the list.

36:49.000 --> 36:56.000
Doctor Who, boobs, game, liquor. Apparently Josta and Sailor Moon are on the list too.

36:57.000 --> 37:03.000
Well I'm glad that the Josta clone or whatever was more important than playing Mass Effect this week.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
No, looking for houses was more...

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Which by the way, the other...

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
And by the way, it wasn't Russian, it was Brazilian, but it was a Brazilian soda at a Russian market.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
By the way, the other comment we got in chat, this is a little bit delayed here,

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
but that the Gaben.tv song, the G-A-B-E-N dot TV song,

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
is appropriate for when Dark Sakura announces that she hasn't played Mass Effect for an entire week.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Now this is supposed to be for the Steam sale.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
This website is brilliant.

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
I really think this should be the official thing that they launch with when you open Steam during the sale.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
It really should be that, but it just launches with that.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
Or whenever Jamie launches Mass Effect, it's a picture of Garrus that comes up.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Are you ready for a miracle?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
You know, that song is gonna pull...

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
That's what's... You know what's gonna happen when they play that song on Steam?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
It's when Half-Life 3 gets announced.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
That's just gonna all of a sudden be like, hey, wait a second, this is from the Steam sale.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
Oh, whoa, now hold on a second. Something's different.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
He's not dressed... He's dressed up like a...

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I want that song played at my 40th birthday.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Alright, anyhow.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I don't know who you people are. I'm leaving.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
You love us. Okay, My Gaming Week.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
For dinner.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
We haven't even done My Gaming Week yet.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
My Gaming Week consisted of Loki's Ouya.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
He let me borrow it.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Now I was playing with some apps on it. I didn't get to play a lot of games, to be honest,

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
but one of the first things I had to do, because again, I'm a narcissist.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
We talked about this earlier in the show.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
I had to download the TuneIn app and listen to VOG on the TuneIn app, which you can do.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
So if you own an Ouya, I urge you, go get the TuneIn app and check out VOG,

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
because we are on TuneIn and you can listen to us through your Ouya.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
I also played that parking valet simulator, the No Brakes Valet, whatever that's called.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
That game cracked me up. That was fun.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
And I was playing around with the Twitch TV app, which runs...

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
I gotta say, it runs... No surprise, it's the exact same setup as the mobile Twitch TV,

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
but it runs very well. I wasn't getting any screens that were entirely black,

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
which I get a lot on mobile. I was getting a lot of good-looking feeds on Twitch TV.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
So that was pretty awesome. I like that.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
Also, as far as other games go, thank you Steam sale.

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
I bought Scribblenauts Unlimited for $5, and I've been having fun with that.

39:31.000 --> 39:38.000
Scribblenauts, of course, is a puzzle game of sorts where you can type whatever object

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
that comes to mind to help you solve the puzzle.

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
For example, I was in a museum level and I had to put things on the paintings

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
that the people looking at them would appreciate.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
So, for example, there might be a caveman.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
So one thing that he might appreciate, a campfire.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
So you put in campfire and you put it in there.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
Scribblenauts Unlimited allows you to use the descriptive text,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
so like you get an adjective, right?

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
When you have a red balloon or a red whatever.

40:06.000 --> 40:13.000
Or I think I had a mission where the guy was going to go pick a girl up on a date

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
and needed a cool ride, so I said, pink SUV.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
And I got credit for it.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Should have done DeLorean.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Yeah, that's true.

40:22.000 --> 40:28.000
The only negative I can think of for Scribblenauts Unlimited is it's more of a word puzzle

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
than it is platformer puzzle, at least in the early levels.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Now, granted, I'm still early on.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
I probably have like 16 stars total, so I'm not like super far into the game.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
But I've played it for an hour or two.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
And I imagine the puzzles get more complicated later on

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
and maybe there's not so much maybe platforming,

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
but certainly the way that items would interact with other items

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
because I've seen a little bit of that so far.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
Like, I think at one point I called out an axe murderer

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
because somebody wanted to be scared.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
But the axe murderer actually ended up killing somebody,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
and that was like a permanent thing.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
So you've got to be careful.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Just watch out when you summon axe murderers.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Maybe you should just do Creepy Stalker.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
Never summon Cthulhu. He will kill everything.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
That's what Cthulhu does. He's an older god.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
All right. So, yeah.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It's a cute game.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
It's kind of an elaborate word puzzler.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
The first few levels you're going to be kind of tapping your fingers on the desk

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
like, okay, this is pretty easy.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
I know what I'm going to do when I get to that level.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
What?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Little red Corvette.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And if it's driven by prints, it'll be even better.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I haven't really seen a sandbox stage.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I mean, I guess you can always go back to the farm level

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
and do whatever you want there,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
but I was kind of surprised that, like, there isn't, like...

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
Well, the first Scribblenauts game, it was just a mode that you just go in the sandbox.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Yeah, I haven't really seen that in this, so...

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
But anyway, it was five bucks. Amazing.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
Actdeft in chat says, I summon Cthulhu for a monster party.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You do see some funny stuff, like in...

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I think it was in the diner level in the basement.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
There's some monsters that are dancing around

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
and they want another person to dance with them.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
So I summon Scary Unicorn,

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
and it was a unicorn with a mask on that was scary.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
It is really cool how the game really can translate,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
like, whatever you type into items.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
And you can even build your own items,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
which is pretty cool and edit stuff, so...

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Yeah, I was...

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
There's still a lot of fun to be had in it,

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
even if the game itself is pretty simple.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
Otherwise, other games I've been playing, not a lot of new stuff.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Still the Final Fantasy XIV beta,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
which Beta 3 finally ends this weekend.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Okay, here's how much I've played the Final Fantasy XIV beta, you guys.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I actually got to the point where it said,

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
Well, that's all the story we have in the beta.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You have completed everything in the beta.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Go home!

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I got to that point in the story where it's like,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Look forward to the release of the game.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
You beat the beta.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
And even then, Shane's like,

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Well, you can still go get your chocobo.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
You're not really done yet.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Go get your chocobo.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
We got more instances to run.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
I didn't play it all this weekend, Rob.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Yeah?

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Because I was...

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I think a lot of people are just kind of waiting for the release now.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
I have to save up the money so I can buy it.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
And also, they're going to nuke everybody pretty soon anyway,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
so it's like, eh, why am I going to waste that time?

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
But Beta 4 should be in about three weeks or so,

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
and that supposedly is going to have the voice acting in the story quests

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
and some other stuff too.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
It'll have more of the game.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Oh, there's voice acting in the game?

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Yeah.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
For the main story quests, there's going to be voice acting.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
Yeah, I didn't know that until I read it, I think on Reddit.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And it was out of a producer interview or something like that,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
so I don't question its legitimacy.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
But yeah, I'm loving Realm Reborn.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
It's such good fan service.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
It's just so well done, especially the first game.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
We don't acknowledge that anymore.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
This is really what it should have been the whole time,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and this is what people want out of a Final Fantasy MMO, I think.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
So, I don't know.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Some Eleven purists would probably argue with me on that,

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
but I really think there's a lot of people that are going to be very happy with it.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
You know what I want out of an MMO?

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Final Fantasy XI, then go free to play.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
WhatupG in chat asks,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
How many hours did you put in Sky?

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
I lost count. Is there a slash played?

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
Easily 20. Easily.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Probably more.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
And I'm not just talking this weekend.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
I'm talking kind of comprehensive across the beta,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
but it's probably more.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Sg100Matt says,

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn on max graphics settings is amazing.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Soundtrack is great, too.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Oh yeah, the soundtrack is phenomenal.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
I mean, to be fair, the soundtrack was actually pretty good in 1.0,

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
but a good soundtrack won't save a shitty game.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
So it's great that now there's this nice game

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
that the soundtrack compliments very well.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
I do need to turn down the crowd noise,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
because there's some weird voices in the crowd noise

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
when you're in a crowded area.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Like the one girl who goes, ha ha!

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
It is neat, though, that when you go into crowded areas,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
you get the crowd noises.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
There's little things like that that really add to it.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
It's really cool.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
That was really it for my gaming week.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Oh, the Mii Plaza games.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I played those quickly.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
A couple of those I checked out.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
There is a space shooter-type game

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
where your Miis that you collect by street passing,

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
the color of their shirts determines the weapons

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
that you can place on your ship.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
So you can have a red shirt as a flamethrower,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
a blue shirt as a homing missile,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
and then it's a little space shooter game,

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
so it's an awesome little addition to Mii Plaza.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Bummer that they cost money,

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
but they're decent games for, what is it, $15 for the bundle?

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
For the four games?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Great.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
To register participation for this week's episode

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
use the passphrase, color.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
All right, that's it for our gaming weeks,

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
so we can get into gaming news,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
but quickly I'm just going to say housekeeping.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Don't forget to add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and follow us on Facebook as well.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
Be our friend, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
or also on Google+.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
All the places you can connect with us

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
are located at our website, orangeloungeradio.com.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
There's a place in the upper right-hand corner

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
that has all these little logos

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
to the different places that we're at.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I encourage you to follow us on Steam as well.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I mentioned before we have our little Steam community

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
at the Voice of Geeks Network,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
which you can see in the forums,

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
that if you're getting into the trading card whoring

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
like I am and like Loki inevitably will get into later,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
check it out.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
The only way that I would get into that

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
is if it was conveniently timed with a game that I'm playing,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
because I'm not going to really play a game,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
although I did for Super Meat Boy, I did play the game.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
And you gave me your cards,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
so I'm more than happy with the way that turned out.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
And you know what though? I'm glad that I did,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
because Super Meat Boy was an excellent game,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
and I do like it.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
It's a great way to revisit games.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I didn't talk about it during my gaming week,

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
but not only did I play Scribblenauts,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I played Really Big Sky, I played Super Meat Boy,

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I played Magica, I played...

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
What else did I play to get cards out of?

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
There's something else, too.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I mean, there's all these games I'm collecting cards in,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
and it forces me to go back and play the games again.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
Yeah. So, anyways.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
Alright, so how popular are these next-gen systems going to be?

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I mean, I think they're going to be very popular,

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
and if anything, we should learn from these pre-orders

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
that they are so popular that they're selling out

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
of their allotments.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
So yes, like any other console launch,

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
they're going to be hard to find at launch.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
So, for example, GameStop,

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
they've stopped taking pre-orders for the PlayStation 4,

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
and they are also running shorts, I guess,

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
on Xbox One systems, the day one edition.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
I guess, well, right now,

47:55.000 --> 48:00.000
they are still selling some of the Xbox One bundles,

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
but a lot of them are gone, so they are almost out of those.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Also, Amazon.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
They have stopped taking pre-orders for the Xbox One

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
and the PlayStation 4 launch bundles as well.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
So, yeah.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
Probably the demand's been just very high for these things,

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
so that's got to be a good sign, unlike the Wii U.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
I don't know. We'll have to see.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
I remember there's still that rumor

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
that they're having some problems with the yields

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
from the chips for the Xbox One,

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
so that could possibly lead to some shortages there.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
We'll see if there's anything to that.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
But either way, it should be a very successful launch

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
as far as console numbers go.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
SSG100Matt says,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Of course there's going to be shortage.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Gonna drive up demand as much as possible.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
Yes, but I mean, honestly,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I don't think they try to do it on purpose.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I mean, granted, that's a wonderful side effect

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
of the console being popular.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
Unlike, you know, I seriously think with the Wii

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and the Wii U or whatever,

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
that they were shortening that stuff on purpose.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
At least the Wii U, because I remember they were saying,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Oh, it's so impossible to find,

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
and yet it was just sitting on shelves

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
like all these different places.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
So I just kind of wonder about that stuff,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
but I don't know.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Once again, it's going to end up,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
they're going to have to sell a lot of units

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
to get the third-party support,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
because if it's just not there,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
if they're not selling any units,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
then they're not going to sell games,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
and they're going to lose support.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
They're going to develop for systems that have the numbers.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
What systems would be left, the 360 and PS3?

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
You'd be surprised, yeah.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
They would just develop for current gen stuff.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
Let's see, in our chat room,

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
WhatUpG says,

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
I think they are putting out more PlayStation 4 than Xbox One.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Dungeon Buster says,

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
In Microsoft's case,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
it could also be a continuing problem

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
with silicon yields for their new CPU.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Alan Alchemy says,

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
It's only on purpose when Nintendo does it.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Live.vognetwork.com.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Well, okay.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
Here's why, and this is kind of going back to,

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
how long were there shortages on the Wii?

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Like, over a year.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
That's ridiculous.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
I mean, even with the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3,

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
there were shortages for maybe six months

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
when they were catching up on the demand stuff,

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
but then they were able to keep up with it.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
But the Wii, it was hard to find just forever.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
It was ridiculous.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
Seeing the day-to-day operation of how Nintendo works,

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
they do allocate a lot of stuff

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
where they kind of hold back things

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
that they could possibly sell

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
and place them in certain places.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
For example, there may be shortages for some retailers,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
but other retailers are getting product

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
because they're filling the demand there first

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
and shorting everybody else,

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
or they're holding back

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
because they don't want any extra units

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
sitting on the shelves

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
to make it seem like that the system is selling out.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
Like the Wii U, they didn't hold back systems,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and there were some sitting on the shelves,

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
and that definitely let people know

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
that it isn't selling out,

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
and so I guess maybe that could have possibly affected

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
demand on it or something.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
I don't really know.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
I don't think it would,

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
but I guess that could be their train of thought.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Way too early to still call a victor this year, though, right?

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Anything still happen?

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Oh, yeah.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
All I'm going to say is

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Nintendo has got their work cut out for them

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
to really sell those consoles

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
because they're betting that these first-party tiles

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
are going to sell consoles in.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Don't get me wrong.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I mean, Nintendo, Mario games are great.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
They do remain the cheapest option on the table.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
They are the cheapest option.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
Oh, speaking of cheap options, actually,

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
I was going to say there is a PlayStation 3 SKU

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
coming out next month for $199.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
What?

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Yeah.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
Oh.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
PlayStation 3, wow.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
PlayStation 3.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
That's still, wow, that's great.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
However, the hard drive is really small.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
It's a 12-gig hard drive.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
They had it in Europe right now.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
They were selling it.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
But 12-gig hard drive for $199,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
that's still pretty cheap.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
And, I mean, granted, those hard drives are replaceable,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
and you can get a cheap hard drive,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
so it might be an easy way to get in

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
if you want a PlayStation 3 system.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
So there's that.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I mean, that might go through the holidays.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Well, that'll help out.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
But, yeah, I mean, seriously,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I hope that that Mario game does really well for them.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
I hope that Mario game and Zelda and stuff

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
really does sell systems for them,

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
because if it doesn't,

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
I don't know much more of what they can do.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
I mean, Mario Kart will be good,

52:46.000 --> 52:51.000
but they may be in the shitter for another year.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Yeah.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Well, I don't think they're just going to stop.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
Nintendo themselves will not stop supporting Wii U.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
No, I understand that.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
You'll still see games

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
that people are going to want on that

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
for the next couple of years.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
It's just, you know, it may not be the powerhouse

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
that the Wii was without all the other third-party support,

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
but, I mean, Nintendo will still make games for their own system

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
while they work on the successor.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
And a lot of games are, you know,

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
Nintendo, people that buy Nintendo systems,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
a lot of times buy it for Nintendo games.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
So it's not a huge loss,

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
but it does affect, you know,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
if you want to buy a system

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
or if you're contemplating buying another system,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
like, let's consider it next-gen.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I still don't consider the Wii U next-gen

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
because of the, you know, hardware and stuff,

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
but let's, if you're considering a next-gen system

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
and you're looking at, okay,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
all the games that are coming out that I want to play

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
and the, you know, Wii U is missing a lot of them,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
you know, you just might not buy the system.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Yeah.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
And by the way,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
just because I say Nintendo working on a successor,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I don't mean like they're hurrying a successor,

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
but it's very common that the research and development

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
of these systems is years in advance.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
PlayStation 5 is probably already being worked on

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
very, very, very slowly in its early planning stages,

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
but, you know.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
If the roadmaps are meant, are to be believed,

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
you know, the one that leaked out for the, you know,

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
the Xbox system and the Kinect and the VR stuff,

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Microsoft's working on some VR stuff, so.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Yeah, yeah.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
We'll see.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Next year is apparently when that's supposed to come out.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
We'll see.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
All right, moving on, speaking of Microsoft,

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
apparently the, as Bobby likes to call them,

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
the Microsoft SpaceBucks, or the Microsoft points,

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
they're being phased out.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Now, we kind of knew that that was going to be happening

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
at some point.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I believe that came up during E3,

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
but it is actually now kind of dated

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
when that's all going to go down.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
The Xbox Live Rewards will be doing away with these bonuses

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
as of August 1st, okay,

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
but the Xbox Live Rewards program will still be there in place.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
Apparently, September 1st is when we'll have more information

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
on whatever the Xbox Live Rewards program turns into.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I think this is the program that gives you, like,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
20 points on your birthday.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Like, ooh, Microsoft gave me a quarter.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Woo-hoo!

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
But in the Xbox Live beta, apparently some problems right now

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
in the new, you know, the new dashboard build is being previewed

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
that's going to roll out in the fall,

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
and I guess some problems there about some negative exchange rates

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
and some that are too favorable,

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
incorrect game title pricing in wrong regions and so forth,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
but, you know, it is a beta,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
so you can't exactly sit there and go,

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
Microsoft, you suck.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I mean, that's what you get when you sign up for a beta

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
is that things are going to screw up.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
We can still say they suck,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
but we just can't say that that sucks.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Yeah, I don't understand how they can't, like,

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
are you telling me that Microsoft is confused

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
on how their space bucks work?

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
I mean, granted, I know it's easy for the, you know,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
North America and stuff where it's, like,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
you know, 80 points equals a dollar,

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
but, like, you know, in other regions,

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
I'm sure it's X amount of points equals, you know, whatever.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
With so much crap in the marketplace, though,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I'm sure it's a database conversion issue.

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
Like, it's one wrong little line of code that fucks everything up.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
I'm sure it's something that simple.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
It's got to be.

56:09.000 --> 56:14.000
So, I don't know yet exactly when the points will move into dollars,

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
but it's going to be before probably this same September timeframe.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
And the 20 points thing on your birthday.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I don't even think I got that.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Who even cares?

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
That is just so ridiculously stupid.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
What can you buy with 20 points?

56:27.000 --> 56:35.000
There was someone at, I think it was Flaco Jones who said,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
you know, hey, I got 20 points on my birthday.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
And I'm like, don't spend it all in one place.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
How can you not spend it all in one place?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
There's only 20 points.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Geez.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
All right. Let's move on.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Dark Sakura.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
Let's see.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
Well, you know how we've talked about the poor sales of the Wii U

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
are probably going to start affecting third party markets

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
as far as what gets developed for them.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Well, it looks like Ubisoft has come out and said

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
that they're not doing a sequel to Zombie U just for that reason.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
That basically the Wii U hasn't sold enough

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
and the game itself, Zombie U, hasn't sold enough.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
So even though they have a prototype of a sequel,

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
they are not going to pursue development.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
There will be no Zombie U 2.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
No Zombie The Edge, no Zombie Bono.

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
It's probably going to be called something else, be my guess.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
And it's going to be Multiplatform because that's why they can't, they know.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
And that's sad too because Zombie U is probably one of the most successful

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
third party games they had at launch.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
I was really surprised by this news.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
It was that bad.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Well, they've delayed Rayman Legends

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
for the reason of putting it on Multiplatform.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I think that's exactly what's going to happen with it.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
Especially now that you have the next-gen consoles or whatever

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
going to have all the second screen support anyway,

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
you can still do all that stuff that they have in Zombie U.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Just do it with the second screen.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Or you can make a lot of that stuff optional.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
So I think that they're going to have another zombie game,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
but it just probably won't be called Zombie U.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
Instead of calling it Zombie U, call it Zombie Them.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Zombie Me.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Zombie Us.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Zombie One.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
I was surprised to hear that it was that bad,

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
but it also kind of shed some light on why they pulled the plug

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
on the Rayman thing so fast.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
It's exactly the same reason.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Yeah.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I mean, because we didn't know this then,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
and we were kind of like, Ubisoft's just being dicks.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
You know, but I guess financially that's what it is.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
I didn't say that.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
Yeah, well.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
Well, it's the one time that Mr. Negative over there,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Norman Negative, is right.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
All right, anyhow.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
What else we got?

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Next up.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
I beat Raginator.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Huh?

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
To my really awful U2 joke.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
You beat him with your shoe?

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
Zombie Bono.

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
So, you know, one of the things that PlayStation 4

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
was going to allow developers to do

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
is self-publish on the PlayStation Network.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
And, you know, basically their thought is, you know,

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
we're going to treat every single individual developer

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
as a publisher as far as we're concerned.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
And we don't separate, we don't segregate indies

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
from traditional publishers,

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
which I think is a fantastic thing.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
I think it's awesome that you see these indie games

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
next to, you know, big budget games and stuff.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
And I, honestly, it's kind of refreshing

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
compared to, like, the stuff that was happening

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
with the Xbox indie games,

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
where it's just like, yeah, we got the indie games,

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
but they're tucked away in a corner in a closet

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
underneath some clothes and stuff.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
And you might be able to find them, you know, if you dig.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
So I'm glad to see that they're actually doing that,

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
and hopefully it is a little bit easier

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
to publish on the PlayStation Network.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So, I mean, and so far, I know,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
at least with the PlayStation 3,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I think it's been pretty easy for them,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
and even PlayStation Vita, so that's just only good things.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And that kind of also carries on over to the Vita as well,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
because, you know, the Vita could always use more games.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
This indie thing has really been great for Sony, too.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I mean, that was one thing people were very excited about at E3,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
was all their indie developers on the stage,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
and kind of one of the places where PlayStation

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
kind of gave Microsoft a little kick in the butt, too,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
because there's been a lot of negative about Microsoft.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Do you think that Microsoft might change some of their strategy

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
when it comes to Xbox One?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I think Microsoft's strategy with the Xbox One,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
or not even really with the Xbox,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
because now they're kind of treating all their platforms as one platform.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I think the problem is they know that people want to develop games

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
for the Xbox One, but they also know

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
they have a lack of application support on Windows 8.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
So therein is going to be basically,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
hey, develop games for the Windows 8 platform, and guess what?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Because we have that kernel running on,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
or that version of the firmware or whatever,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
however you're going to split it up,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
we have that running on the Xbox One,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
your games will be able to be ported over to the Xbox One very easily.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
That's how they're going to win on both platforms,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
because they want to sell those operating systems,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
because that's where they're probably going to make a lot of money.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And at the same time, they also want to have stuff on their console,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I just think that that's what they're going to try to do,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
is try to get people, almost like,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:44.000
trick them into making games for the Microsoft platform, I guess.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Shadownextgen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
you have to worry about whether PlayStation Network on PS4

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
will turn into the App Store, though.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
That's a good point.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I mean, the App Store has a lot of crap on it,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
like a lot of crap.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Like, how many fart apps do we need, right?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Flashlight apps, really?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I don't think it's going to happen that way, though,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
because even right now with the way PlayStation Network's indie games are,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
it's easier for them to get on,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
but I don't think it's like, you know,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
they can just throw games up there like you can on the indie store.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I don't know, it'll be interesting to see how they do it.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Do you think there will be some type of quality review process?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I think so.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Because the problem is you open it up too much,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
and that's where you start getting all the IP theft stuff, too.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Like, we've heard about the stuff in the App Store

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000
that was like literal ripoffs of games that existed other places.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I remember there was one, like a Pokémon app.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
All it was was pictures of Pokémon,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
but people legit thought it was like Nintendo's Pokémon on the App Store,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and people were downloading it like crazy and losing money on it.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I think that they'll probably have some sort of review process in there,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and, you know, they'll probably just, they have just a fun and happy medium.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I mean, you can't just make it super duper easy to put stuff on there.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I mean, look at, like, for example, the Ouya.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
There's a perfect example of how you can self-publish on there,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
but there's not a ton of stuff on there.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
That store is a mess, too, I gotta say.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Okay, well, that store has been a mess since launch,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
especially with their, like, fucked up, like, menus and stuff.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The way to navigate that is, it's not very well,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
and, like, you know, you look at, like, all the different bars that feature things,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
and, like, every single one of them has got the same games in it,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
just in a different order.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It's like the Wii U store when it first launched,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
or not too much different now.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Yeah, so it's just kind of weird,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
but they do have it where you can easily publish stuff on there,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
but I think it's just some sort of, you know, quality sorting and stuff,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.000
and just, you know, better ways to search for what you're actually looking for.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Alright, well, you know, THQ had some problems last year,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and they went bankrupt, and, you know, a lot of their properties went to all these different places,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
hence why, you know, we have Deep Silver doing Saints Row now, and so forth,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
but Sega, apparently not happy with the way things went down,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
because they filed a claim against THQ, and bankruptcy court, of course,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
because THQ is bankrupt, for almost a million dollars,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
just shy of that, about $941,000.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
That apparently is the amount that THQ received in pre-orders,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
after Valve's cut, for Company of Heroes 2.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Apparently, Eurogamer had also reported that about a half million was made

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
after THQ filed for bankruptcy,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
so Sega wants to get that money back that came in from pre-orders for Company of Heroes 2.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Double Fine, Codemasters, and other former THQ executives

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
also looking for the money that they're supposed to be getting.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
This doesn't mean any of them will get anything.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I imagine this is part of the process, filing the claim,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
so you can ultimately later on claim it as a loss when it comes to tax season later on,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
but it's interesting that this THQ drama still goes on.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
By the way, the reason why Sega wants the money is because they got Relic, the developer,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
and the Company of Heroes property,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
they bought that for $26.6 million at the THQ asset auction.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
So, that's what's going down. Sega wants their money.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
They want to buy their building back from Zynga.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I wish.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
You know, they say, if we had a million dollars, we could make Dreamcast 2.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
If I had a million dollars, maybe Sonic 4 wouldn't suck.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
You know, it's funny the difference between what a million dollars is to you ten years ago versus now.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Right. Anyhow.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Now I'm like, house! I can buy a house!

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Well, did you know that video games can become professional sports, according to the US government?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I remember when we used to talk about when is DDR going to become a sport.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I know, right? Well, you know what made it?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It was in Finland or something, wasn't it?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I think. But you know what made it officially? League of Legends.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000
It has now been considered, and this is a quote coming from Riot Games,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:16.000
esports manager Nick Allen, said the United States government recognizes League of Legends pro players as professional athletes

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
and awards visas to essentially work in the United States under that title.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:29.000
So, yeah. It is officially an esports, and the pro players are e-thletes, as I'm calling them.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
That's my new word, and you have to give credit to me. E-thlete.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I don't know if you're the first person I've heard that term from.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Well, you know what? I'm saying it, so whatever.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But this means that, yeah, you can actually apply for a visa if you're a professional e-thlete.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
You know what this also means? We can just add this to the list of sports that I'm terrible at,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
which is right up there with baseball and basketball and football, League of Legends.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
There you go. That's why this is a sport because I'm terrible at it.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Do you suck at croquet?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Yes, actually I do.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
You know, I cannot play croquet without singing Que Sera Sera to myself because of Heathers.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I'm pretty good at miniature golf.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
So am I. My husband's really good at it.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Is that a sport? Is mini golf a sport?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
It is officially in my universe.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Okay, well that's all I need.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Well, I've been talking about forming the island of awesome, and I think the national sport of the island of awesome should be mini golf.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I honestly think that they should make mini golf courses the size of actual golf courses and televise that shit,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
because I want to see someone doing a drive off of a giant loop-de-loop and all sorts of crazy stuff.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
It could be right there with dodgeball and League of Legends on the Ocho.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
It's been eight. The Ocho.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Gamergirl in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Then I guess this means Dota 2 is next?

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
You know, that's a good comment because, you know,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:56.000
it brings this interesting area where you've got a game that's essentially owned by a company as a sport.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I mean, what about all the competitors that make similar games?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
We're going to have Blizzard, All-Stars, Valve has Dota 2. Isn't there another one?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
There's another one I'm not thinking of. There's another smaller one.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Because, you know, all those guys that contributed to the original Defense of the Ancients mod in Warcraft 3

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
all went their own separate ways, so you got all these games because of it.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Is Dota 2 going to be a sport? Or what happens next?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
How do you guys feel about-

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I still think we want pro DDR.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
How do you guys feel about- but DDR's dead, yo. Haven't you got the memo?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
No, it's not.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It's like the disco boys in Mystery Men. Eddie Izzard. DDR is life.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
No, it's death.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
After we're done playing.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Loki, what do you think about video games becoming sports?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
It's kind of ridiculous to call it a sport.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I mean, just call it something else, but it's not like a sport.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Isn't that what gamers want?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I guess if you want to call chess a sport, then I guess we can call video games a sport.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
But, I mean, I don't know. I always think of sports as something, like, active.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I mean, even chess is kind of like, ehhh.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
You can sweat playing chess.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
In a hot room.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Whatever. I mean, fine.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
But, those people are- you're not going to see it in the fucking Olympics, okay?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
It's just not going to happen.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
And don't even try to, like, petition that shit.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Tiger Claw says it's called eSports.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It's like new sports.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Will we have the Olympics?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
That'll be actually kind of cool.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
For our eathletes.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Shouldn't it be Sports 2.0? Because, you know, the whole, like, Web 2.0 shit.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
ActDeft.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I want Robot Jocks.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
ActDeft in chat.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
For reals.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
ActDeft in chat says, how about stuff like EVO?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Well, that's all going on right now. Like, that's a huge Olympics type of thing.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
That's only for fighting games.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
But still, I mean, getting quite a bit of viewership and controversy of its own online.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
So, we'll get into it later in the show.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
So.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Man, I like EVO when there's, like, people that no one's ever heard of who just come in and kick ass.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Yeah.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Well, that's like any sport.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Yeah, but I really like it in Street Fighter because I've played a bunch of, you know, people who are really good.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And sometimes they can be dicks.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
It's like Wimbledon. It always makes headlines.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
I liked watching the video from, I think it was EVO last year, where they had I Wanna Be the Guy Guy Den.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Mm-hmm.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
That's a good name.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
That was awesome.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Infinel in our chatroom says, next, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics will be in eSports.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
That's very meta. I like that idea.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
We'll see.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
We'll see.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
All right, moving on to release dates.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
We're going to travel around the world and check out what games are coming out that could be a sport in a few years.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
We'll see. Loki?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Well, I don't know about any of the games you're going to support this week.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000
But, because, like, for example, there's Turbo Super Stunt Squad, which is a game based on the-

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Is it turbo-tastic?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Probably not.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:49.000
It's based on that Dreamworks movie about the snail that somehow ingests NOS and so becomes, like, a super fast snail.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Because, you know, that's science right there.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Mm-hmm.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So, they have that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Also, this week, your ever yearly multi-release version of you versus a bunch of other feudal Japan warriors.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Dynasty Warriors 8 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Also, this week, Time of Eternity on PlayStation 3.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Let's see, the Serious Sam collection being released on Xbox 360.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
There's a bunch of Xbox Live arcade games that were on there.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I want to see. I think that might be it.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Am I missing something?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And that's it.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Let me move to Japan then and if Loki thinks-

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Bye, Rob.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Bye.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Bye, I'm moving.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Alright, moving to the Japanese release dates.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Final Fantasy XIII-2 gets a price reduction on the PlayStation 3 on July 18th.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Shin Sangokumusou Online Z in regular edition and Treasure Box edition comes out on the 18th as well.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
This is Dynasty Warriors Online, right?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
That's what that is.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
That's on the PlayStation 3.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Going to the Xbox 360.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Final Fantasy XIII-2 gets its reduction there too.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
There's like a digital contents version and platinum collection.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Oh, I bet digital contents is just all the DLC.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Like the Saw's side story and all the stuff that came out for XIII-2.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
There was a lot of DLC for XIII-2.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Okay.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
So, yeah. You don't care about XIII-2?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I'm just like-

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Pass.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I'm agreeing with you. I'm like, okay.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Okay.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Well, there's nothing to debate here, Darus Sakura.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
These are the release dates.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And I'm just accepting them.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I've accepted them into my version of reality.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Alright, fine.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You will import them into Planet Sakura.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I am incorporating them into my own virtual consciousness.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Fair enough.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
On the Wii U.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Yes, Sniper Elite V2 is out this week from Ubisoft in Japan.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Sniper Elite, that's a game that's out here?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Is that like one of the small Clancy games?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
No, it's a World War II sniper game.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Nintendo 3DS sees a little bit this week.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Mario & Luigi RPG 4 Dream Adventure comes out this week from Nintendo.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Damball Senkai W. Cho Custom comes out this week from level 5.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
There is a special Luigi Nintendo 3DS XL this week.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I don't know if it's like green or what the-

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I gotta see what this is.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Is it a green?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I mean, it has to be, right?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Oh, it's like-

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
No, it's white.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
But it has like little green silhouettes of Luigi all over it.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Green and teal and light green.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And barfy yellow.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Easter egg.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
There is one of those that's actually a Mario.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Oh, really?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Yeah, you said it looked great.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
That like snuck on there? Like a red one?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
No, it's not red. It's green, but it's a Mario.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Look for the squat, Mario.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
It must be on the-

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I think it's on the back.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Yeah, it must be on the back because I don't see it in the little box art here.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I am surprised that DJ Rama S doesn't try and import one of these.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So, we'll see.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Maybe he will.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Also on the 3DS this week,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Shin Sekaiju no Miku Design Skins

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Oh, those aren't even games. Those are just little skins for the 3DS.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Osahare Hamster 2 Korosau Ishoni Orakake comes out this week.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Do something together?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Play with adorable hamsters.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Oh my gosh, it's Hamster Sam.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Maybe it's just play together.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Oh my god, the box. This is adorable.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Why do we get games like this here?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
They're on a sunflower.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
The hamsters are sitting on a sunflower.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Wearing bows.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
One is wearing a tiara.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And then you look at the game shots.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And they're playing in this cherry blossom field.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
With a little hamster wheel.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And then there's one underwater here.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And then here's one with the hamsters. They're just chilling at the beach.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
This little chief hamster there sitting in a lounge chair.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Just chilling at the beach.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
That's not realistic at all.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
First off, they were in the field of flowers.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
They're not going to have Richard Gere's asshole as a level.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
No, I understand that. I'm not saying that they do that.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
They'd be running from owls level.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I'm just saying that they would just shove in their face full of food.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Because that's all hamsters do. Shove their face full of food.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And poop.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
They throw their poop, actually.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Because they like to keep their cage clean.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
So they huck it like footballs.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And they pee on you when they're nervous.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Yes.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Rama is pointing out that he's not interested in this 3DSXL because it's region locked.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Well, you know what? We need to find a way to un-region lock

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Osahare hamster to Kuraso Isho ni Oda Kake.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Because, again, here's the game.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Yeah, I think it says let's play together.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Here's a game that we need in America.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Why don't we have this game in America?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And Nintendo's fascist state 3DS will not allow me to import this game.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
This is a challenge to OLR listeners now.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
If you have a hamster, I want you to put a bow on it and send me a picture.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
But keep the hamster. Oh my god, don't harm the hamster.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Don't glue it to the hamsters head, you know, like, or what do they do?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Staple it to the hamsters.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Safety first.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And Scrooged. That movie is great.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But, like, I want to see, or you can Photoshop a tiara onto your hamster.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I want to see your glammed up hamsters.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Photoshop dark soccer's face.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Glampsters. Yes, that's it.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
That's the game that we need, Rob.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Oh my god, is that a dream game?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
OLR dream game, glampsters.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Glampsters.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Hold on, hold on.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Okay, yes.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
There have been games by Activision.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
There's actually, I believe, like a pet's hamsters with a Z in there.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And they have had games where it's pet's fashion where you actually do dress up.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
It is not that cute.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
But there's also a hamtaro game.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I don't, you know.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000
But not like little CG actual looking hamsters that are adorable, that wear bows and tiaras and go to the beach.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I want Photoshop of a hamster with a crown on a beach chair.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That's my challenge. I mean, I could do it myself, but I'm lazy.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000
We're just gonna, no. This is a whole president cat thing going on here.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Because who made this?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
We need to start harassing them.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Nippon Columbia, yes. I want their Twitter harassed.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000
And we're gonna call this game Glamsters, is the US localization title.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And I want Glamsters in the, I don't even know what it translates to.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Who cares? It's Glamsters.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And I want Glamsters in the US.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Rob, the name is essentially playing with hamsters, or playing together with hamsters.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Glamsters.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Who made this? Nippon Columbia.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Can we, what's their Twitter?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
O.L. Army, get to work. Bring me a Twitter.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Alright.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Where is Ikuma JP when we need him?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I know. I mean, I appreciate Ikuma JP every week he listens, but I really need him tonight.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Where is he?

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Ikuma-san, find us this Twitter.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Alright. We need you.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Anyhow, let's move on to the UK.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Captain Planet.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
While we plan our wishes to get Glamsters localized.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I wish I could move to the UK, then I could avoid the bullshit here.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Alright.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Sorry.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
On the 14th, which is, what, today?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Isn't it now?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Mega Man Unlimited for PC.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
On the 16th, Mamoru-kun Curse on PlayStation 3.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
On the 18th, Plants vs. Zombies 2. It's about time.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000
And that wasn't me saying that. That's actually the title.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And guess what? I'm spent.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I'm surprised Mega Man Unlimited was listed on there. I think that's a fan game.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Yeah, I think it's a fan game. We're kind of surprised that's on there.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Well, it's on there so good for them.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Yeah. Got good reviews.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Alright, so, yeah. Apparently, websites be getting hacked again.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000
So, Bohemia Interactive had their website hacked.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And you may remember them for the ARMA series.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000
And also, basically, they've had to reset all of the user's passwords.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
As a precautionary measure.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
They basically said that credit card information was not stored on the server.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And they weren't sure what was taken during the breach.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Or if anything.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But basically, all the stored passwords were encrypted.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And they're saying it's very unlikely anything can be done with the passwords.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
But, you know, they reset them.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So, you got to make a new one anyways. There you go.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And Konami has also been hacked as well.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Konami's ID portal website had a large batch of unauthorized logins.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I guess during the month of June.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And basically saying that it's exposed some customer information.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And they recommend changing your passwords.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
So, yeah.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
And apparently also the information that may have been exposed.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Customer names, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, email addresses.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
And that's it.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So, change of passwords.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Yeah.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Hackers gonna hack.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Yep.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I hope your password that you used on these websites was not the same that you used on your bank website.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Because that would have been a really bad idea.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
That's why these things get hacked.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
For people that use the same password everywhere.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Well, maybe you'll see Glamsters on the show floor at Tokyo Game Show.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Actually you won't because it's already out in Japan.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
But we can still dream it will still show up at Tokyo Game Show.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Tokyo Game Show had its list of exhibitors announced this week.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
When is Tokyo Game Show? October-ish?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Usually September.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
September? Yeah, it is September.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
The exhibitor list is out and Microsoft's on it.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Which is a bit of a surprise because the Xbox One.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Why are you laughing over there?

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:01.000
We got all these cool things to show you that we're not releasing this year because the Xbox One's not coming to your region because you're second tier.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Xbox One coming to the second tier country of Japan.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Sorry, I don't say that to be offensive but the reality is that since Japan didn't support the first Xbox.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Do they have cosplay at Tokyo Game Show?

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Yes.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Oh yeah.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Good, someone can cosplay at Tumbleweed and maybe roll through the booth.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
You're such an ass.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Microsoft's also going to be going to Gamescom if anyone's keeping track of that.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
But yeah, it'll be interesting.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Also, folks at Tokyo Game Show.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Sony, Capcom, EA, Sega, Squeenix, Konami, Namco Bandai, Tecmo Koei, Bethesda.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
All those folks are going to be at Tokyo Game Show.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Guess who's not there?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Because they're never there.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Nintendo. Nintendo will not be there.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
But they never do Tokyo Game Show.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
They usually do their own thing that same week.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Because they're Nintendo and that's what they do.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Alright, Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with a comment on the hacking article saying it is Konami's own fault they were hacked.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Their code was up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Womp, womp, womp, womp.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
You shouldn't use the same code in every game that you make.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
There you go.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Actually it's different in Proteus.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Wasn't it like literally backwards?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
It was backwards.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Silly.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Alright, well, speaking of games that the Konami code might work on, we're going to take a trip down memory lane.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
It won't work on this game.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
That code really did work in a lot of games.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Yeah, not this game because this week is not a Konami game.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
But it is the classic game of the week.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:40.000
DarkSakura is going to jump into her gaming vault or maybe she'll go to an expo and see a lot of classic games and find one that she thinks, hey, respect this game or get out of my planet.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Yeah.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Off my planet.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Get off my patch of land here.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Pinbot.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Ooh, good choice.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Yes.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
And it's actually not the table.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It's the NES game that Rare developed.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Excellent choice.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Um, the game came out.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Crap, I didn't link the YouTube.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Yeah, Rob.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Sorry, it'll take me a minute to get the audio.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Got everybody.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I'm sorry for Rob.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Shut up.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I'm sorry for you.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I'm sorry for your face.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
There we go.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Aw, epic Rare soundtrack.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Got it now.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Didn't have such good music.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Can we just listen to this for a minute?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Sure.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I don't want to hear you talk.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I just want to hear this.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
You what?

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Ah, sexy lady Pinbot.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I like her, uh, electro boots.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Alright, I suppose you can talk now.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Anyway, the game came out in North America in 1990 and it was a version of the same pinball

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
machine that Williams did in 1986.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:45.000
The NES version actually has most of the stuff from the machine and graphically is pretty

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
darn accurate, I think.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Um, even down, I like how they even have like the Williams logo at the bottom and how they

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
did the scores where the normal price things are.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Um, so the point really is just to get points.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You start off with your marker set on Pluto and you have to go through the solar system

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.000
by hitting different targets and different checkpoint planets give you a special so you

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
get extra balls that way and when you reach the sun you get a super special so you get

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
another extra ball.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Um, you have the visor too which basically works exactly like it does in the arcade machine

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000
and I'm sure, I really hope most of you have played the legit for reals pinball, I mean,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Pinbot before.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Um, but you have a 5x5 grid that has drop targets and once you've hit them the grid

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
lights, the visor opens and you can lock the balls there to start your multiball and in

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
this game it is a double multiball.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000
So, you can also relock balls while they're in multiball and get extra points.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000
So with this, um, basically the, to get such a long play field it actually crops it where

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:59.000
your flippers are and the top screen moves until it reconnects to wherever it would be

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
once they're joined.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Um, it has the ramps, it has everything.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It really is about the best.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I mean, other than now like on Pinmame or something it really is probably, uh, it was

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000
the only good version of this game you could get at home apart from owning the table.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
And, um, I mean I'll sit and play this sometimes too.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And one good thing about this too is that, um, it actually has, um, some of the synthesized

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
speech from the game.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Um, although it pauses the game to play the speech.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
It has most of the music, the sound effects.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
You can turn them on and off.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Um, your pause is on your second controller.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
The first, um, can't because you use start and select as your nudge.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
You know, make sure you don't tilt.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Um, a lot of people really, really liked it because it is a faithful rendition.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
But there are people who did not like the enemies and hazards on the play field as they

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
were not in the original.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000
They did, um, Rare reused the game engine to do high speed which was also based off

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
of, uh, Steve Ritchie's High Speed.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Um, but it was published by, uh, Trade West.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
But it used Rare's engine.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
By the way, Steve Ritchie is a really cool guy.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
He did the voices for Black Knight.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
For, um, for, uh, No Fear.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And, uh, he's just a really cool dude.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I want to do voices on a pinball game.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Be fun.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Yeah.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Stop shaking the table.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Rob's game would be called Girl, Please.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Bitch, please.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Yeah.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000
But anyway, as far as other, um, pinball games that came out on the, uh, NES, there

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
was pinball, rollerball, rock and ball, and pinball quest.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Uh, I really think that pinbot is the brightest on the list.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Pinball quest is one of those games you kind of remember through rose colored glasses.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Like, oh man, pinball quest was awesome.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And then you go back and play it and you're like, God, it was, it had so many bugs and

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
issues though.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
It was not good.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Pinbot is just solid.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
It was a testament, I think, to, to rares, you know, early rare games.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Rollerball wasn't bad.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Rollerball wasn't bad at all.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Uh, you forgot the, the actual game called pinball from, uh, Nintendo.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Yeah, there was pinball.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
But I still think that pinbot is the best of the bunch.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Yeah.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Oh yeah, I agree.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
You know, rollerball was also, uh, I thought there was one other I'm not thinking of.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I'll tell you what's funny.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000
The actual table for rollerball was the one that I, the first game I played when I got

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
to the expo.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Oh.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Yeah.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I didn't know it was a real table.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Yeah.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
It's like, um.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Was it like four screens tall or something?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
No.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Oh, maybe I'm thinking of a different game.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Or maybe it was roller games.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Roller games is one of them.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Yeah, I think you're, I think you're blending those.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Because I think rollerball on NES was like a four screen tall table.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Yeah, it was.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I was thinking of roller games.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Sorry.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Um, you know which one I always wish would get, uh, would have had a release like that?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
It was hyperball.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
The one where you have, like, the major multi balls and that's all you do is shoot, like,

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
pinballs all day and all night until you hit these little side targets.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Rollerball would have, uh, uh, hyperball would have been fun.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I think.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
But digress.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Pinbot.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Classic.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
It's, you can't go wrong with Pinbot.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Alright.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
And if you have, anyone ever thinks to get a classic table, Pinbot makes a great start

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
and it makes really good for trading up later.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Alright, there it is.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Your classic game of the week.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Pinbot for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
One of my favorites.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
A non-Sega game.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Oh, my stars and daughters.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
You know what?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I do non-Sega games all the time.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I've done compile.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Non-Sega slash non-tomographic.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Non-tomographic game.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I've done Irem.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Alright, no, it was good times.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Uh, some folks in chat reminiscing about some of the portable pinball games that were really

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
good.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Uh, Fifth Dream says Pokemon Pinball owned.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Uh, Black Wolf says I enjoyed Metroid Prime Pinball in the DS.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Yeah, both were really good.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
What was the game that was on the old, the original Game Boy?

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Was it Revenge of the Gator?

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Revenge of the Gator.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
That one was fun.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Yeah, that was great.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Revenge of the Gator was great.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I would stay up all night playing that damn game.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I remember playing that in seventh grade.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Were you a Revenge of the Gator fan, Bradley?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
No, I was thinking about something even earlier.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Oh, your mic cut out.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I don't know why.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Let me, yeah, just uh.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Oh yeah, it came off the end there.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Okay, I was thinking something even earlier than these games.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
It was a, I don't know if it was based on any real pinball table, but there was a pinball

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000
on, uh, on the Atari 2600, uh, like Midnight Magic or something like that.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Yeah.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
I don't remember.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Atari had one of their own too.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Yeah, it was like a really basic sort of thing.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:35.000
One of my favorite Commodore 64 games ever was Pinball Construction Set by ECA.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
That's what EA used to be back in the day was ECA.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Pinball Construction Set was awesome.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Like you, it was literally build your own damn pinball table, but people would, you

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
know, uh, there was no internet really back then, but you could find, you would disc trade

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
with people and get their pinball tables and yeah, you could find some pretty epic stuff

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
out there.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Amazing.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
So, uh, lots of props for Revenge of the Gator in our chat room.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Black Wolf says I loved it.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Rama says Revenge of the Gator was godly.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I knew Black Wolf would remember Pinball Construction Set.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I knew he would.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I knew he would.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
There you go.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Good times.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Hmm.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:14.000
You know, I was actually just thinking that it would be cool if, you know, cause you know,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
like, uh, there's actually a pinball table for Rollercoaster Tycoon.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Um, it would be cool if they did like sim pin now, you know, where it's, you build your

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:29.000
pinball tables and then put them out on, um, on, uh, like, uh, some, you know, something

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
like steam, you know, you put your, you have the crater and you put your tables up for

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
other people to download and compare and rate.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Or how about just freaking pinball construction set, but like, you know.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.000
And I think that the game you were thinking of was called, uh, David's Midnight Magic,

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
wasn't it?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000
No, there was a midnight magic for Atari 2600, but there was also a David's Midnight Magic.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
See, here's the pinball construction set.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Let me see if there's actually music or if somebody talking in this clip here on YouTube,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
but yeah, you can see that they're putting together their little pinball table and they

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
put a little ramps and all the stuff you use to build it.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.000
So they're on the side and then if we actually see like a finished table here, it was David's

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Midnight Magic.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
There's also a Commodore 64 version, Rob.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Nice.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And, uh, it was on the Atari computers and the Atari 800.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I'm sorry.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
The Atari 2600 version was just called Midnight Magic.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Hmm.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Very cool.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
All right.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Uh, that's going to do it for this part a of Orange Lawn Tradio, but don't go anywhere.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
We've got more of Orange Lawn Tradio to come after the break.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Oh my God.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Crewball.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
That was awful.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Crewball, apparently.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Uh, the mailbag, the Fugu Question of the Week, your phone calls, and some more stories,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
including, yes, we're going to talk about that little controversy that went down between

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Nintendo and Evo and, uh, speaking of Nintendo, a possible new franchise for them next year.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000
We'll talk all about that when we come back with more of Orange Lawn Tradio right after this.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Hi there.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
My name is Elliot B, and you're participating with Orange Lawn Tradio, the show where every

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000
gamer has a voice, and I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It has musical apes fighting reptilian pirates.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
What more could you ask for?

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Boobs.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Welcome back to Orange Lawn Tradio, live with episode number 512, July the 14th of 2013.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Big thanks to Elliot there for the bumper, even though that's the second time you all

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
have heard it, because I don't have any new bumpers to play, so I think you guys need

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
to fix that.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
For more information about sending a bumper to Orange Lawn Tradio, check out vognetwork.com

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
and the forums has all the information there in Orange Lawn Tradio.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Everything you need to know there.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Uh, I'm playing the, um, new Find Me games during the break because I streetpassed with

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Bradley, who's sitting here in studio tonight, and I also streetpassed with Dark Sakura.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Now, one thing I noticed about this Warriors Way, which I'm still trying to figure this

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000
game out, it's basically like you have troops, and the troops number is based on the number

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
of people you've had ever in your plaza.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Now, I streetpassed with a friend of mine that does some of the shadowcasting for movies

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:14.000
here locally, and he's like, dude, Rob, like, you gave me 700 people for my army in Warriors

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Way, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, I've been to E3 and all this stuff.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
You know, I've picked up quite a few people, and he's like, you helped me beat a level,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
and I'm like, cool.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
So I'm like, alright, I'm awesome, I have a big army.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Well, I just streetpassed here with Brad, who came into Warriors Way.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
25,000 people?!

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
You've streetpassed with 25,000 people?!

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
That isn't, actually, that isn't the right, that's because, that's like the monarch,

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
that's what the person who's actually played the game,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Yeah.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
come as a monarch.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Oh, wait, wait, you're not, okay, sorry, we're not hearing you for some reason.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
No, it's my fault, I didn't mute you.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Sorry, Bradley.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Okay, so that's not exactly how many I've streetpassed.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I actually have a thousand, like, a little over a thousand streetpasses.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Still, that's a lot.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
But the army is 25,000 because, as you play the game, you get more people into your army,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
and then, and it'll show you the actual force.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I think it's, you come in as a monarch if you've actually been playing the game,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Yeah.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
and then that's when you'll see something more than, like, a few hundred to a thousand.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Uh-huh.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Okay.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
25,000, showing what my actual armory is right now.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.000
But, your people weren't like, oh, I'm gonna join up, you tried to attack me or something,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I'm like, rude!

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Yeah, so that's what happens if a monarch comes in, you have to,

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Ugh.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
you have to either let them go in peacefully or attack them.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Assert them.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Well,

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Basically, crush your army.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000
I did not get 25,000 troops from Bradley, but I did get, like, 50 from Dark Sakura,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
so that helped me.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
That'll, that'll help a little bit.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
What?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
There we go.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Alright, um, moving on, we're going to get back into some gaming news here, starting

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
off with Loki.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Yes.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, um, Crazy Taxi.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
That's right.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Crazy Taxi.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Are we gonna make some crazy money?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Possibly.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And, Crazy Taxi has come to Android, and, um, yeah, it's out for, uh, five bucks.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
It's basically like the, uh, IOS port.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
They've got, uh, the two modes, original and arcade.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And I think some of the music's back, too, so, um, that's good.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I mean, I'm sure they don't have Pizza Hut and all that stuff in there, but, um, still

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
fun.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And I think it does support some controllers, so the first thing I'm gonna do with this

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.000
game is I'm gonna sideload it onto the Ouya to see if it works, so that's gonna be, uh,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
mission number one, I guess.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Um, new Ratchet and Clank game was, uh, revealed this week into the Nexus.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:46.000
That's gonna be, um, coming out at some undetermined point, I guess, holiday, uh, for thirty bucks,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
and, um, on PlayStation 3.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
So, look for it then.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:58.000
And, uh, last but not least, uh, we have some more details about the PlayStation Plus version

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
of Drive Club.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Obviously, it will be missing a few things.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000
It's basically the exact same version as the full version, except it's missing a few

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.000
assets, such as, um, some of the cars or tracks that will be found in the full version.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Um, I guess the PlayStation Plus edition, I guess, will feature online multiplayer and

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
the single-player campaign, as well as some of the challenges.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Uh, you will be able to purchase missing content.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000
But press the R2 button to upgrade to the full version of Drive Club now.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I think it's not gonna be as expensive as buying the full version of Drive Club, but

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
still, I mean, if you wanna check it out, that's kind of a cool thing.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
And you don't have to buy the full version of it.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I mean, like, for example, if someone like me just wants to play it, like, on a VoG gaming

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
night or something like that, I don't need to buy the full version.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
You know, I can just play it as is.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
So, it'll be cool to check out.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Yeah, I mean, I wasn't expecting...

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000
To get a release game on the system's release for free, I mean, usually the PS Plus games

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
aren't, like, new stuff.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Like, it's usually a year old.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
So, I'm not totally surprised by this, that it's basically a glorified demo.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
But it sounds like it'll at least have, like, some multiplayer.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
So, it'll give you a little something.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I mean, this is what we get now instead of a pack-in game, right?

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
A free download coupon.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Technically, you get a pack-in thing, but it's, you know, only if you have the camera.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, the cam...

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
I don't have the camera, so I guess I'm screwed.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Because I was lucky enough to order a PlayStation 4 early, and I don't plan on changing that.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Anyway, moving on to other news.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Capcom had some layoffs this week.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
That's always a bit disappointing.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
One of the people affected, Christian Svensson, which is the Senior VP, excuse me,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
of Planning and Business Development.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
He apparently is departing the company.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Capcom said in a statement,

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Capcom today laid off several employees from the US office as part of an overall organizational restructure of the company.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:58.000
The transition to new generation of hardware and changing industry landscape have required us to adapt our business to best meet our new goals.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000
We sincerely thank each individual for their contributions and wish them well.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Well, this is never fun news to report.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Trying to kind of figure out the why behind this, though.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Is this because maybe expectations of Lost Planet 3 and so forth are kind of low?

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
It's because there's no more Mega Man?

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
It's all Mega Man's fault.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
It's all Mega Man's fault.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
All Mega Man.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
It's all Mega Man's fault.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
If they did Mega Man Legends 3, they wouldn't have this problem.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Now, now, no need to kick them while they're down.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Alright, Reggie Fils-Aime in a video on YouTube mentioned that Nintendo fans can pick up Pikmin 3 early at certain video game retailers.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:40.000
July 20th and 21st, you can actually do like a hands-on demo at over 250 GameStop and EB Games locations.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
They still have EB Games up and running different places?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
A foreign company.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Oh, in Canada.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Yeah.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
So the US and Canada will have Pikmin 3 experiences or whatever.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:58.000
If you pre-order the downloadable version of the game at any GameStop store on either of those two days.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000
So you have to go get a download code at GameStop on one of those two days.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000
You will be able to get the full game one whole day early on August 3rd.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Or you can go to Kmart.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Who breaks street dates.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Or Toys R Us.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Or apparently Walmart is the new street date breaker because you know you can get them Twinkies at Walmart.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Yeah.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
It's rogue Twinkies in the Walmart aisles.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Or just wait a day. It's Pikmin. It's not fucking Grand Theft Auto 5 or something.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Right?

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I mean, that's what you got, you know, that...

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I mean, think of the deal with the devil that you're making here.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I mean, you're like buying a digital download code at retail to play it one day early.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000
And they will make you sign a pact at GameStop that you will have to sign with blood.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Hey, let's give us your email. Hey, why don't you send it for the card, you know, so that we can...

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Hey, you want to get our magazine?

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
You got Pikmin 2 to trade in?

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Tristan told their magazine is actually pretty decent.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
You got any other Wii U games you want to trade in?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Oh yeah, there aren't any Wii U games out there to trade in.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
There are. They're just not worth anything.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Well, remember Nintendo's philosophy is make games that people want to keep.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
To be fair, like the games I own, I don't want to trade in.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Maybe the Sonic Racing game. I guess that wasn't that great.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
But I still like it enough.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Nothing is ever as good as Sonic R.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Alright.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Also, one more story about Super Street Fighter IV.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Apparently still going with updates.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:37.000
There was a panel at Evo announcing Hyper Street Fighter IV with five new characters.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Four of them have been named.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Alina, Poison, Rolento, and Hugo.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Rolento!

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Which are all based off of the fact that they were in Street Fighter X Tekken.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
So I'm guessing that they'll be easy enough to bring over.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
So those are the only four confirmed characters at the moment.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
No word about the mystery fifth character.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Although not... It doesn't sound like it's Alex.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Alina's a fun one.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I guess there was a rumor going around that it was Alex, but it doesn't appear to be Alex.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
So, um, interesting.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
What is this all about here? $15 for the download.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Don't know what the date will be, but there will also be a disc-based version, which I'm assuming is everything, for $40.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Early 2014 is the tentative release.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.000
You know, I'd like to see some of the EX characters make it into the new Street Fighter IV stuff.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
It's pretty cool that this game is still going.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I mean, thanks to updates and DLC and all that.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
You're shaking your head over there. You're a hater, Loki.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
How many times have they re-released this game?

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I mean, seriously, they've had...

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
How many times have they re-released Street Fighter II?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I understand that, but they had Street Fighter, Super Street, or they had Street Fighter IV.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Then they had Super Street Fighter IV.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I'm talking all disc-based releases.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
And now they're gonna have hyper Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
No.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
You draw the lines.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Stop buying that game. Seriously.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000
It's done. Just make a new Street Fighter game.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Give me Capcom vs. SNK III.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I don't care what evil, satanic pacts have to be formed between those companies to get this to happen,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
but I want that game.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Give it to me.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Alright, moving on. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Anything? Dark Soccer? Hello?

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I'm waiting for...

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Sonic 4 is going to have its episodes on Ouya.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:38.000
So I guess if you like crappy Sonic games and crappy systems, then you can play Sonic 4 on Ouya.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Also though, and this is good news, Sonic CD is going to be out on Ouya,

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
and it better freaking have the Japanese soundtrack.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
They're just porting the... They're not even porting the game over.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I mean, it works with controller support already.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
You can sideload that thing in there.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Because I have a Sonic CD, I got it with my Moga controller,

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000
and I think it's siloed on my Ouya, actually.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I don't remember if I did that or not, but it works.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Osega of America saying that it's going to be soon.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
That same soon that we always refer to.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Also, fans of Skullgirls can be happy that it's coming on PC on August 22nd.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Being put out by Lab Zero Games, and I know a lot of people are totally into Skullgirls.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
They're also working on five new characters as DLC,

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
which is coming directly from their Indiegogo campaign.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
They've actually exceeded their $150,000 goal.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.000
They've made $828,768.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
So, yay more Skullgirls.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:50.000
And then, this one, I'm actually going to relink this one because it's on Capcom Unity.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
But I wanted to talk about it.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.000
The PS3 art for DuckTales Remastered, the box art, has been released,

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
and it's looking pretty darn good.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
And I'm really looking forward to this.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.000
There's also a link on here to the documentaries,

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:13.000
which talks about the game itself and the development.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
So, I'm going to go ahead and actually relink this one in the chat room.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
And if any people who are listening to the podcast want to look forward,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
just go to Capcom Unity and look through their blog.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Yeah, they're actually going to do a physical retail release with pins in it.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Nice.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Yeah, I heard about that. It's a week later, though, which sucks.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
But, it might still be worth it.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Rob, life is like a hurricane.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
It blows?

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
No.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
What?

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
The song? The theme song?

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Rock you like a hurricane.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
DuckTales, Rob, theme song.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I get it, I get it, I get it.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Just a little slow.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Geez, Rob.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.000
By the way, though, I listened to the Japanese theme song for DuckTales.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
It's kind of interesting.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
It's a song by a lady.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Oh, time for the Fugu Question of the Week, right?

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I didn't realize that was our last story.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
G-Rob, you know, you got on me for being quiet, always pulling up everything.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And now you're doing it, too.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I was playing Mii Plaza games, it was very important.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Hot kettle, pot pot kettle.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Very, very important.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
My butt.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Let's see.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Looking at chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Apparently, BlackWolf made a Vine of me playing Pimbot Ness, me meaning him,

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000
while listening to OLR, but Vine decides not to accept the upload.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I guess this is why everybody ran away to Instagram.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Sad.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Have you guys played with the Instagram video at all?

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000
No.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
No.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Rob, Instagram is like, so three months ago, I swear.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Oh, Hipstagram.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Alright, here, I had to hear this.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I need to use a top-level digital camera out of irony.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Amazing.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Still catchy.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Some things transcend language barriers, and a catchy melody is one of those things.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Maybe this little theme song here is a catchy melody for some of you out there.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
It's my vehicle.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Every week, we go to our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities and ask a question,

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
and we read some of our favorite answers here live on air.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Or if we have enough time, which I guess we probably do tonight with the answers we were given,

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
we will read all the answers.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:01.000
So this weekend, Dark Sakura and Bradley attended California Extreme,

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:06.000
which is a classic arcade game show in the Bay Area that is a celebration of pinball machines and classic game machines.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Is there a classic arcade or pinball machine that you've never played that you've always wanted to try?

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:18.000
If you can't think of one, is there one you remember from a long time ago that you really want to play again?

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000
So we wanted to show some love to classic games in this week's FUGL question.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Retertainment says, there's what I call a classic arcade game that I've played that I'd like to play again, The Act.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:35.000
This is an extremely rare arcade game that, according to Wikipedia, only one arcade has a working stand-up arcade copy of it.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
It just so happens the one arcade with a stand-up copy of The Act is located near me.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
It looks like I have something to do on Monday.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
What is The Act? I don't even know that one.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000
The Act is a game. It's all hand-drawn animation.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000
It's basically about this guy who's in love with some girl.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:59.000
It kind of, like, think of it as almost like a Dragon's Lair type game, but it's not really like that.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:05.000
They built it for, like, iOS and Android and stuff, and it has a lot of contextual sensitive stuff in there.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000
But it looks pretty cool. It's all, you know, gorgeous and looks like it has a good story.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Let's see, Rababa responds on Google Plus and says, I've always wanted to try Hyperball, the ball-bearing gun rapid-fire pinball.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Jamie probably has, and I'm curious as to the general object of that game. Spell things? Shoot them faster than they drain?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I talked about it earlier. I just like shooting them really fast, just because it's fun.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:37.000
And there's so many, it's like you can play with so many balls. You can paddle balls all day.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
You just took all those balls all at once, didn't you guys?

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And I beat them. I beat those balls with flippers.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
With your flipper?

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
With my flippers.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
That game is fucking loud, by the way.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Going to Facebook, which, by the way, I just want to point out over on Facebook right now,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:05.000
we have 572 people that like us on Facebook, which is a nice, admirable number, but we're 572.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000
We need one more like, and then there'll be a huge Bamani and joke there.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Come on, people. One more like on Facebook. Somebody give it to us.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.000
30K replied and said, Simpsons Pinball. There were actually two Simpsons Pinball machines with her.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Was it Simpsons Pinball Party, are you thinking?

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
There's an old one and a newer one, isn't there?

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Simpsons Pinball Party we used to have at my house.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Yeah.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
It's a pretty fun table.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Andy R. said, I was a bit young during the arcade boom, so I don't remember,

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.000
but if I can expand to non-classic arcade games, I really want to play ju-beat or, u-beat,

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I always say that wrong, excuse me, u-beat or reflect-beat in an arcade.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I love rhythm games like Technica and I feel these games would be a lot more fun in the arcade than their iPad equivalents.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
You'd be right.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Sadly, I no longer live near Round 1 or Sunnyvale Golf Land, so I guess I'll have to settle for the iPad.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Xtafer replied and said, Growing up, I loved plating side-scrolling games, I think he meant playing,

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
side-scrolling games in the arcade like Shinobi or Strider.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I also have fond memories of Golden Axe and Super Mario Brothers.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Which, actually that reminds me of something, Rob.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
You know what game they also had there, speaking of side-scrolling?

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Willow.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Oh.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
That Willow arcade.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Amazing.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Sorry for the Facebook noises, they're not disabled on this computer and frickin' people are setting it off on purpose.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Alright, Thomas B. replies and says, Have you ever heard of the pinball machine Hercules?

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Yes.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
I believe it used 4-inch balls.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.000
The machine was very large, I only played it a few times, but it was always fun to play.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Do you like big balls, Dark Soccer?

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
And I cannot lie.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
It used a cue ball.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Oh, like in pool?

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Yeah.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And they had one at the last classic gaming expo I went to, it was at California Extreme

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.000
two years ago, they also had that dressed up Captain Fantastic 2.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.000
The big Elden John platform boots from Tommy.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.000
But Hercules is actually, I'm short, I have a hard time playing that game because I can't

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
really...

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
You can't reach the balls?

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:07.000
No, I have to, it's like as wide out as my arms go.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
It's like my wingspan, and hitting the flippers is difficult.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
And it moves slowly.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Dark Tetsuya says, There was one I played years ago in Santa Cruz that I'd love to chance

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
to play again, Namco's Galaxian III.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Imagine a gigantic booth with six seats, two 50-inch monitors with a separate laser displayer

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
for each one, and six Star Wars-style flight controllers.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000
You fly along in your gunship, shooting at aliens as they fly in formation, while occasionally

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
dealing with a gigantic alien boss.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And it's up to you and your teammates to take them down before they deplete your ship's

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
life meter to zero.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Suffice to say, it's pretty epic.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Do you want to know something depressing?

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:48.000
At our Roseville Dave and Busters, right by the redemption area, there is this booth

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.000
for a different game, but that booth was once a Galaxian III booth.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
It even has some of the decorating elements on it.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
That used to be a Galaxian III.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Let's see.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Will M. replied and said, An arcade game I've never played and would love to.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Difficult to answer as I've played a massive amount due to traveling around, but I can

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
name one I'd love to play again.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.000
The Ninja Warriors.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
That widescreen was oh so damn awesome.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Chiggers says, I remember playing The Kiss Table when I was a kid.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I loved it.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Ragenator said, I never had the opportunity to play the arcade version of Killer Instinct,

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
which I regret.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
In terms of stuff I want to play again, it's Samurai Shodown IV, Amakusa's Revenge.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Hitstun says, I want to play Data East's 1990 side-scrolling beat-em-up masterpiece,

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Trio the Punch, Never Forget Me.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
What it lacks in graphical power, responsive controls, or music changes, it makes up for

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
in being batshit insane.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Enemies include a giant bronze foot that stomps you, enemies that plant bombs that self-destruct

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.000
in fear of those same bombs, a giant statue of Karnov carried by four smaller Karnovs,

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:59.000
and Colonel Sanders with a head that explodes to reveal a purple bird that froze fried chicken

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
at you.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
What?

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Sounds a lot like Proteus.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000
The game's only console release is a Japanese PlayStation 2 exclusive.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
He could have made that up and I'd never know the difference.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Codeman replied and said, I know this sounds like a generic answer, but I've always wanted

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
to play the Tron arcade game.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Which one?

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
That's true, there was Tron and Discs of Tron.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000
They had actually Tron and Discs of Tron next to each other.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Codeman, more reason for you to go to Disneyland, just saying.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000
And I know you have a little girl who soon will be old enough to appreciate Disneyland,

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
just saying.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000
If you take a child to Disneyland before they're five years old, they get him free.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
There you go.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And a game called Time Pilot.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Time Pilot's fun.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000
That is, for what it's worth, that's on Xbox Live Arcade, and it plays pretty decently

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000
with a 360 analog stick, just for what it's worth.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
And it was in Game Room.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000
And lastly, Kane I Am says, not that I ever played it, but I really want the Elvira Mistress

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
of the Darkness table for my house, because boobies.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Excellent answer.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
That is a great table too.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Which one, the Elvira Mistress or the Scared Stiff?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Elvira Mistress of the Dark.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Scared Stiff I think is a better table.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Okay, so I know you saw this, Dark Sakura, because Alan and I went out to a bar in San

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Francisco after the Frank music concert on the 4th of July, or the night before the 4th

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
of July.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
We went out in San Francisco, we went to this bar in the Castro called Moby Dick, and they

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
had pinball machines there.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:29.000
And, like, literally, it was like Dark Sakura and Alan Alchemy, Pinball Paradise, because

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.000
they had a World Cup Soccer 94, and they had Elvira Scared Stiff.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Okay, I need to go there.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Yeah.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
First of all-

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
And gays, and booze, and a pool table.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Like, five of my favorite things together.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
That actually is like college for me.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Well, keep in mind, I worked in a pool hall.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I'm very certain that my boss, even though he was a major dick, was also, he did set

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
off the Gator a bit.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
And, of course, there were also the three other guys that I used to hang out with.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Anyway, anyway, I've been a hag all my life, Rob, what are you talking about?

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
It's fine.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
So, and then we had the World Cup Soccer there.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Across the street, at Solomon's, they had the Mistress of the Dark.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000
But did your pool hall let people play free if they weren't wearing pants?

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Because this place did.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.000
No, usually, if they weren't wearing pants, well, I don't know, I could wear a skirt,

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
then I wouldn't be wearing pants.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
What if a guy comes in in a Utila kilt?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Does that count?

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:35.000
I didn't question the system, because nobody wants to see me up there playing it, so.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
You know what, you should just have, like, sequined boxers.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
And wear those.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
How do you know I don't?

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Alan, does Rob have sequined boxers?

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
The 1970s, you know, basketball shorts.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Like the ones that are, like, up to here.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
They have, like, the teeny slit on the side.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Like your ass literally hangs out of them, yeah.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
You need to go in Columbia shorts.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
That's not sexy at all.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000
None of this is sexy.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Columbia shorts.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000
None of this is sexy.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Columbia shorts.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Alright.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
That was all our answers.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Thank you guys at Facebook and Google Plus for answering the question.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Really appreciate it.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000
If you didn't get your question, or your answer read this week, sorry.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
But try sending an email.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Let me quickly open that up to folks here in studio.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Is there an elusive game you haven't been able to play, or maybe something you played once long ago you're dying to play again?

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Bradley?

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I was thinking of, it was, when I played it a long time ago,

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Galaxy Force 2, the actual arcade game that actually had a full rotating seat, or sit-down cabinet where you basically...

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Sumo.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Yeah, but full rotating.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Like, could you actually go upside down and stuff?

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Well, full rotating, 103.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Oh, yeah, 360.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I get it.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
You're not rotating upside down.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
You're just going left and right.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000
But that was pretty cool.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
And then, like, the home version that was on the Saturn didn't really do it justice, I think.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Or maybe it was just a really janky game I didn't know until later.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Loki?

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Well, I would have said the Galaxian 3, but someone already said that.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I would be willing to try the Silent Hill arcade game, because I still haven't played that, and I know that was something that they made a while ago.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
So the Silent Hill arcade game would be fun.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:21.000
And although it's not really an arcade game, I'd love to go back and play Battletech again as part of Virtual World.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Did Alan just text you?

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Yes, he did, and he said no.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Alan!

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Jamie, is there something that's been eluding you?

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I would like to play a radiant silver gun again, because I've played an arcade version of that, and I loved Gun Survivor 2.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:46.000
I think what I would actually like to play again as far as tables that I haven't seen in a little while is a black rose.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
And I've been trying to get Dan to get us one.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I would love to have a black rose.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Because you shoot a cannon, and you're a pirate wench.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
That's the best.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:02.000
I honestly can't think of any games that I've never been able to play that I legit haven't played.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I just miss old arcades. That's what I want more than anything. I want an old school arcade again.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I guess my answer would be, I would really like to play F-Zero AX again in one of the sit-down cabinets.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
That shit was pretty amazing, and I missed that an awful lot.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000
And we're not talking just the regular sit-down cabinets, we're talking the ones that rotate.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000
The ones that will almost flip you upside down, just shy of that. I missed that. That was epic.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000
So I would say maybe, yeah, I guess that's my answer. F-Zero AX. I'd like to play that again.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:38.000
There was a pinball table that I hadn't played in a long time that I actually got to see at California Extreme the last two years.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.000
A pinball table called Genie, which actually my dad had when I was young.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
I think I know that one.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:51.000
And sadly this year, one of the flippers or something was weak or broken. It worked, but not very well.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:58.000
It was working a lot better last year. It was kind of a blast from the past because he sold it 20 years ago.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Let's see, Koopa Kid Jeremy is in our chat room saying about old arcades, I'm assuming.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:12.000
I miss the smell. Not really. This was probably before. When I was a kid, California hadn't banned smoking pretty much everywhere yet.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000
So I seem to remember Sam's Town up Highway 50. Remember that place? It was so awesome.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:23.000
I remember that place smelling like cheap pizza and cigarettes. That's what old arcades smelled like.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And Chuck E. Cheese. Well, Chuck E. Cheese didn't smell like cigarettes. They did ban smoking in there, I think, because kids.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:35.000
But cheap pizza for sure at Chuck E. Cheese. Anyhow, let's see.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Code Man says, tell me about it. I don't even want to know what an arcade is anymore.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Well, God, I think there's somebody legit said in their answer, you know, I think I was kind of born after arcades were really a thing.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000
And that just made me like I had a sad for a minute. You know what? I'm going to offer up a description.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:59.000
This was the Aladdin's castle in Mobile, Alabama. The day I went after my little brother had gotten hit by a car.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Oh, my. He was six. He's 30 now. No. Twenty seven right now.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:12.000
So that, you know, dates it. The walls were half carpeted the same way they had been since the 70s.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:17.000
This is yeah, this has to be like 1992, something like that. Ninety one.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:24.000
The walls had brown carpet up to the side like a roller rink does. Old wallpaper.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Posters of games from the 80s. And the first thing that you saw when you walked in was a samurai showdown to on the 44 inch screen.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Big ass thing to the left would have been a hockey. I remember perfectly to the left would have been in your hockey table.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.000
As you go back, you see narc. You see a four player Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000
You see a street fighter to a hyper fighting edition.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:56.000
You see, you know, in the far, far back or your pinballs, your Galaga, your Q.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Bert, we had a Q. Bert kicks. So you go in.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:08.000
And the first thing that you hear is, first of all, you sort of smell the same type of smell that comes from Confunk.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.000
You know, sweaty boys playing games, but you hear loud noises and you see bright neon.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.000
And when you leave, if you don't have a headache and your ears aren't ringing a little bit, you haven't been there long enough.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:26.000
You're doing it wrong. Yeah. Koopa Kid Jeremy, our buddy from the Koopa Club podcast in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Chuck E. Cheese smells like pee. I don't remember. They do now. That's for sure.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I don't remember from when I was a kid, but maybe, you know, everything I remember.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I have this really early memory. You know, I don't remember a lot from when I was like before.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Like, you know, you don't remember a lot from before you're like five years old. I don't know about you guys.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.000
But one thing I do remember is being, I think I was three years old at my sister's wedding,

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000
because my sister would have been 19 or 20 at the time because there's a big age difference between us.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.000
And we went to Chuck E. Cheese after one of the rehearsals, I think it was. Not after the wedding.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.000
She didn't have the reception there. We went after Chuck E. Cheese after one of the rehearsals.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:07.000
And I remember there was a room. Well, I remember two things. I remember playing Crystal Castles.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.000
And in order to play the game, I had to stand up on one of those little, like, box things that they had for kids.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:17.000
So I could sit up there and peer over the edge and move that little trackball around so I could move the little bear.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.000
And I remember a room at Chuck E. Cheese that was nothing but a strobe light.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
And you would, you would dance in front of the strobe light or whatever.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
And like, it's like 80s technology, like strobe lights, like this new technology.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Now you can have a strobe light on your fucking phone.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Did yours have the Dayglo room?

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.000
It was black, black lights with drawings on the wall that would glow under the black light.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000
And at my Chuck E. Cheese, and this is like the old, old ass one that, like, I think burned down.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Yeah. But there were the hands and feet on the wall right above the door.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
And you go through the door and you're in this little room that's Dayglo and then on the other side is the bathroom.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Wow.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000
But we had that too. We had the strobe room too. And then we had the room with the hippo lady.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Yes. I remember the hippo lady.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
The party room with hippo lady.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
All those.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Henrietta Hippo.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000
They still have all the animatronics. They just, they get scarier as you get older.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000
But anyway.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Yeah. We had the showbiz pizza at my place.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Yeah. One of them bought the other. Chuck E. Cheese bought showbiz at one point, right?

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Yeah.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Yeah.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Pizza Time Theater.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Were you from this area? Were you from the Bay Area?

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000
No. I'm from South Carolina.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Oh, that's right. Okay.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
You know who owned Pizza Time Theater, right?

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Oh, at Nolan Bushnell.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Yeah.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Yeah.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
And then there was Bullwinkles. They had the water show.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Water sports?

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
They had a water show. They had a fountain, like, interactive. Like, it would just do this fountain show thing.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Like, a mid-tier version of what you would see, like, at the Bellagio or something like that.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Was that, like, the climax of the Great Muppet Caper? Did Miss Piggy come out on the fountain?

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Sort of, I guess.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:47.000
So it's Bullwinkles, you know? All the Bullwinkles characters.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Yeah. I remember the time when I always wanted to go to the mall because that's when they had the arcades there.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000
They had Aladdin's Castle and both of the malls that we had at the time.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Mm-hmm.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I was going there all the time.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
No, no. I don't really want to go to malls at all.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:05.000
God. When I was a kid, I was so obnoxious because whenever my parents were going on vacation, like, we literally, I was like, I was 10 or something.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000
We went to Hawaii. We went to Maui. We went to Hawaii. And I'm like, I want to go to an arcade.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I want to go to an arcade. I want to go to an arcade. Arcade.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:18.000
So we went to some mall and, you know, because my mom liked to shop anyway.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
So we went to the mall and they had an arcade and I got my way.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
I fucking miss malls having arcades.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Yeah, I know.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
True. Seriously.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Well, I miss, and actually, I'd have to say that even though I hated doing parties and stuff,

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000
that was probably the most fun job I've had was working at the arcade.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Because, like, I could just hang around all day, you know, yeah, I had to, you know, do that, what, dust mop thing that you,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:48.000
the mop with the motor, the vacuum motor thing that you just push around and go instead of actually a vacuum.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
And, you know, and walk around and just get to chat games with people.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:05:00.000
I worked at Aladdin's Castle when we had, when Tekken 3 just came out and we had just been purchased by Namco as well.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
So we had shirts with Pac-Man on it. It was really cool.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000
And whatever the cyber station that was all Pac-Man branded themed and everything, that was really cool.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:13.000
But working at the Aladdin's Castle was just a touch like working in an old 80s style arcade.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
And I had a good time there.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.000
I mean, I would come home with a migraine every night, but other than that, I had a great time working there.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Yeah, good memories about arcades. Good times.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:33.000
And also that was figuring out the right place to knee the Street Fighter Alpha 2 where I could play for free.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.000
You know, as far, was that like your first minimum wage job type of thing? Because like my first...

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
No.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
No?

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:45.000
My first minimum wage job was working for a grocery store, which I probably quit a week later because they scheduled me during my classes.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Dope.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
I don't actually count that as a for reals job because it was hell.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
My first minimum wage job was not that bad.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:55.000
But my second one was working in the game room at school.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Oh, okay.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
And then after that, it was working at a cookie store where I lived on cookies for a year.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
And then it was the arcade.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I worked at a place called, they don't exist anymore, it was Placer TV Video, which was a video rental store they used to rent.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
I know of them.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Yeah, well, they were still around like in the mid 90s, like when everything was starting to shift to DVD.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:20.000
And at that time, they were still renting NES games and like videotapes, but they didn't really get on the DVD bandwagon fast enough.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
And that's kind of what killed them.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:31.000
But we rented porn, like, because like that's and that's seriously why people would come to Placer TV because there was, you know, Hollywood Video didn't rent that stuff.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Blockbuster didn't rent that stuff. We had porn.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:39.000
So that was kind of fun. Like my first minimum wage job, I get to like check out porn to people.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Did you have the red door?

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
No, it was just on the top shelf.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:53.000
There was there was no laws prohibiting that stuff. People weren't so freaking like trying to be politically correct and protect everybody back then.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
It was just kids can't reach that high.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.000
My granny taking me to rent videos when I was in Dothan for a summer.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
And by the way, the arcade we had in Dothan was Tilt.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Yeah, I remember Tilt.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000
But she just said, OK, pick whatever movie, make sure it's a good movie.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:12.000
You know, I'd read Star Wars like fifty seven thousand times and actually return to the Jedi because that was my favorite movie.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:20.000
And then I once rented this movie that I think the name was in another language, but it was pretty much Tiger Shark.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:24.000
And it was one of those Jaws like movies, except with naked people.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
And I watched it. I watched the whole movie.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:33.000
And I'm like, my sister's my sister's with me and she's like, this movie's dirty.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:38.000
I'm like, there's so much blood, blood orgy.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:43.000
I loved being taken to go rent movies with people who hadn't who wouldn't read labels.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.000
All right. Memory lane, memory lane. And we're not even back into gaming news. Sorry.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Let's get back into some gaming news, Loki.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:58.000
All right. So there is a little bit of a controversy with the new Deus Ex game, The Fall, that came out on iOS platforms.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Apparently the game had a lockout for jailbroken devices.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Now, I guess the general thought is, well, your device is jailbroken, you're probably stealing the game.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:16.000
That's not always true. People jailbreak devices to, you know, put their phone on a different carrier or something like that.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:25.000
So there's that. So people that were legitimately buying the game allegedly were unable to fire the gun in the game.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Couldn't fire it. Nothing.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:33.000
That's kind of a I mean, it's like one of the you hear about the clever anti piracy things like, you know, in what?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Batman, Arkham Asylum, like you couldn't jump far enough to get past certain parts of the game.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:42.000
You know, I and I can applaud for a clever anti piracy thing.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
But jailbreaking your device isn't piracy.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
It's legal, actually.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
I thought I thought then they come down and say that was illegal.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
And I think it's gone back and forth a few times.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:56.000
It's a mess. But I mean, people jailbreak exactly like you said, just because you jailbreak your device doesn't make you a pirate.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Yeah. And on top of that, though, you know, there is an app that you can get from the, you know, the homebrew store or whatever.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000
That basically you can patch it so that you can play the game.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.000
It basically makes your device look like it's not jailbroken, even though it is.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Well, what they should have done is they should have put this out there on the piracy sites like the hours before they put it out on the official app store.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:31.000
That's how you get the pirates is you got to put like the version of the game up on the piracy sites and then kind of like flood the the market, so to speak.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I mean, it'll get ratted out as a fake soon enough. But by that point, it's already kind of saturated.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Well, if you know, apparently, you know, people didn't like that. That was the case.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:46.000
So they're going to patch it out later on. It says we we have not been clear in our communication because they didn't mention anything either.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000
That says that this work. They were trying to be discreet about being dicks.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:55.000
But, you know, they made a huge mistake in that jailbreaking. Your phone doesn't make you a pirate.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Thanks, Square Enix. So we have not been clear in our communication earlier this week when we launched Deus Ex the fall.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.000
We did not clearly say that the game world would not support or the game would not support jailbroken devices.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:14.000
And we'll be switching this off via an update so that all support IS devices will be able to play the game in the near future.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000
So although at that point, nobody will want to anymore. Well, maybe the people that bought it.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:30.000
All right. There was quite a bit of controversy this week and finally came to a head this weekend with the Evo tournament that's going on right now.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.000
And where was this? Las Vegas, I think. And it's being streamed all around the Internet.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000
I think some people are watching it while they're listening to the show. It's finishing up right now, I believe.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:46.000
And, of course, big controversy this week. Super Smash Brothers Melee was pulled from the live streaming schedule at one point.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Super Smash Brothers Melee was pulled from the weekend event in an update on shoryuken.com.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Evo co-founder Inkblot said, regrettably, we've just been informed by Nintendo of America that we do not have permission to broadcast Super Smash Brothers Melee for Evo 2013.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Well, now, this whole thing was a bit of a mess because in order to get the game featured in Evo in the first place, they had to do a charity fundraiser to raise the money.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Not for the tournament, but I think to get, like, the whole thing was, like, which fan communities can raise the most money for a good cause will feature those games in Evo.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:24.000
That's the sense I get from this whole thing. And sure enough, the fans of Smash Brothers Melee raised $90,000.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Well, in comes big bad Nintendo to pull the plug on this, you know, to not have this happen.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:46.000
But, thanks to the immense vocalness of the internet and trending topics on Twitter, Reddit, certainly a bit of a PR nightmare, and within hours Melee returned to be broadcast over the Evo 2013 tournament.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:12:01.000
What's interesting, though, is that it did came out after that. So, it got reinstated. It was pulled, it was reinstated, but then it came out after that that co-founder Joey Quellar, I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong, said about the Evo.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:10.000
He's a co-founder of the Evo thing and an organizer. He said they were not only trying to shut down the stream, they were trying to shut down the event, the Smash portion of the event.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.000
It's their IP. They can do what they want. They didn't present us with any options to keep it open.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:23.000
But, of course, that obviously didn't happen. They ended up streaming it after all. This does seem like a real bad case of communication.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:29.000
And kind of the PR department saying one thing and the legal department coming through and saying another.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Nintendo is incredibly protective of their IPs and so forth. It sounds like it wasn't really understood what was going on.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:46.000
We already know there's some weird cloudiness with Nintendo's, you know, because of everything that happened with the Let's Play stuff not that long ago or anything like that either.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:52.000
You know what? I couldn't be helped but reminded of this. And you guys are gonna think I'm crazy, but deal with it. You already do.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000
By the way, Evo, not E-V-O. It's evolution.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Oh, sorry. I thought I said E-V-O. Anyway, I thought of this. I was reminded of a couple years ago. Do you remember when Weird Al did that parody of Lady Gaga's Born This Way that was performed this way?

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:19.000
And he said that he couldn't put it out. He was gonna do it as like a single or whatever. He couldn't put it out because Lady Gaga said no.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Lady Gaga, he always gets permission from the artist, or at least always tries. But if the artist says no, he won't put it out and Lady Gaga said no.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:31.000
And all these people started tweeting Lady Gaga like, you know, bitch, it's Weird Al. Let him do the song.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Well, turns out Lady Gaga comes out and says, I never heard the song. One of my people, like one of her legal people said no to it.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Even though that legal person in the response said Lady Gaga said no. But she had never heard it.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:56.000
And it wasn't until the whole thing blew up on the internet. I couldn't help but be reminded of that because unfortunately, yes, I'm comparing Nintendo to Lady Gaga. Hear me out here.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:05.000
But it's this whole big mess of he said, she said, right hand isn't talking to left hand. And this is the stuff that happens. And it did make Nintendo look stupid.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Like, you know, this is all for, well, it was done by charity for a good cause to bring positivity to an old Nintendo franchise.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:22.000
It's a game tournament. Who gives a crap? I don't understand why they would have such an objection to it. The only thing I can think of is because it's being broadcast.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:33.000
But I don't know. It's like, come on, you guys are trying this point. I think you want to salvage any sort of good faith you have with the community.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Since you kind of need them right now to buy your damn system, especially when the new Smash Brothers game comes out.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Maybe, I don't know, people see Smash Brothers that haven't really played the game while watching the EVO tournaments.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:53.000
And they're like, hey, you know, that looks kind of fun. Maybe I should buy the new Wii U and buy the new Smash Brothers game when it comes out.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Or you could say, fuck you, you ain't going to watch it. You're not going to get to watch this because we're just going to be dicks about it.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:07.000
And then, you know, now you're just pissed off a community and you're like, we're not buying your system or your game, so forget it.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
But then they'll buy the game because, you know, they have to have it.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Tigerclaw said that he heard that Super Smash Brothers Melee had over 130,000 people watching the livestream during the game's finals earlier today.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.000
It was the most watched fighting game in history, according to the co-founder of EVO.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Interesting, because the whole thing did kind of work out in the game. I mean, I think more people watched it because of this controversy.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:33.000
I think a lot of people wouldn't have had an idea this was happening. I'm going to be honest. That's what happened.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:40.000
And then, of course, we have our Smarties in chat saying Act F says, play this way. Rama says, stream this way.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Ooh, baby, there is no way. We will let you stream that game. You cannot stream that game, no.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
No.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
I tried.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:16:01.000
All right. Anyway, well, glad they worked it out, but legal department and big companies need to figure, you know, realize that this is the world we live in.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:08.000
It's yet another example of Nintendo does not understand the internet. This does not help their case.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
What is it, a series of tubes?

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Yes, right? Dark Sakura.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000
It's these wires and there's things on them and they do stuff.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:25.000
How about a new IP, a new franchise coming from Nintendo. This was actually voiced by Miyamoto.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:35.000
And God, I hate how this looks on my iPad. Basically, he let it slip that there is going to be a new franchise and he said this on the Japanese publication.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:49.000
He didn't release any details, but he said that they were trying to get away from relying on their longstanding franchises, wanting to innovate and go a bit further with what was out there.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Thank you.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:56.000
So maybe they finally understand how innovation works.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:02.000
I'm glad that they're coming up with new IP, like the new IP that they launched the Wii system with.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Excite Truck needs a sequel, a good sequel. And I'm not talking about Excite Bots because that was crap.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:11.000
You don't put mini games in the middle of a fucking race.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Yeah.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I shouldn't have to throw a pie at a clown while I'm racing a car.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I do that all the time. It's called going to Disneyland with Dan.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Or make a sandwich. Literally, there was make a sandwich during Burger Time Racers.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Don't get me wrong. It's a funny idea. I mean, in playing the game, you're just like, what the fuck? You know, this is silly, but it's just...

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:46.000
We need Wario's Wacky Races. Wouldn't that be crazy? Instead of a Mario Kart, do like a Wario Kart and have it be like just completely fucked up.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Well, this new Mario Kart 8, you're going upside down. Mario Kart 8 basically looks like F-Zero, which, like, it makes me happy.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Why can't we just have F-Zero?

02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:02.000
It makes me really happy and really fucking irritated at the same time. Like, Nintendo, you're just like, you're fucking teasing me now. Stop it.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Nintendo, wrong.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000
I'm all for new IPs, though. You know, new IPs are fucking...

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Build this wonderful engine for F-Zero and then we're like, eh, no one wants F-Zero.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Nobody wants F-Zero. Nobody wants that.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Alright. So, Desura has actually been purchased up by, what was it, the Second Life company, Linden Labs.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:36.000
And so, what's that mean? I have no fucking clue. Other than, you know, it's changed ownership.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:42.000
I don't think it's really going to change anything as far as, you know, the distribution service goes.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
So, yeah, it's interesting.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Maybe Second Life will become like PlayStation Home and you can launch games within Second Life.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Except with a lot more furry... No, actually, it is exactly like PlayStation Home.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000
It would be exactly like PlayStation Home. It would be very meta because, like, PlayStation Home was kind of inspired by Second Life.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.000
But there are flying dicks in Second Life and not in PlayStation Home.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Well, there are dicks in PlayStation Home.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
They're not flying, though.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Do they have rocket packs?

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Alright. You can file this in, you know, I don't know if this is Rule 37 or what, but this is just the gaming community at work here.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:34.000
There is a petition going around telling Microsoft, or I should say asking, demanding that Microsoft bring back the restrictive DRM policies that they had already rescinded due to outrage.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Yes, there are fans petitioning Microsoft to bring it back.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000
It's actually a petition posted on change.org.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
I hate that site.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Why do you hate change.org?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Because you sign any petition on there and you get 50,000 spam emails from them.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.000
And, yeah, I'm all good for signing petitions, but not on that site.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
I will not sign a single one on that site.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Okay, so here's the petition.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:08.000
This was to be the future of entertainment, a new wave of gaming where you could buy games digitally, then trade, share, or sell those digital licenses.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Essentially, it was Steam for Xbox, but consumers were uninformed and railed against it, rallied against it, I think they meant to say, and it was taken away because Sony took advantage of consumers' uncertainty.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.000
We want this back. It can't be all or nothing. There must be a compromise.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Two, whoever, give us back the Xbox One we were promised at E3.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Sincerely, your name. They have hit 24,476 signatures.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Yeah, and a lot of those are just troll signatures, too, by the way, because they're like, yeah, we want them to do this.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:46.000
But I'm sorry, once again, comparing the digital marketplace that Xbox One would have to Steam is just stupid.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:52.000
And there's a perfect example of the difference right now with the Steam sale.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:21:01.000
First off, you see a lot of discounts on Steam, and Steam is not the only place that you can get Steam games.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:16.000
You can get Steam games or Steam DRM-enabled games on Amazon, on Green Man Gaming, a bunch of different websites out there have these games at different prices all the time, so there's competing marketplaces.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:20.000
There are not competing marketplaces when Microsoft owns the marketplace.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:25.000
That is the only marketplace. The price that they have it on there is the price that you're going to pay for it.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:32.000
And on top of that, I think the whole reason was the whole game sharing thing, and we still don't know what the fucking details were on that.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000
This is what pisses me off about this, too. You don't know what the fuck you're complaining about.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:43.000
You literally, and I say to all 24,000 of you, you literally do not know what the fuck you're complaining about.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:49.000
They never said what the rules were.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:58.000
I know this is a show where every gamer has a voice, and I welcome every opinion, but I can literally say this petition is ignorant.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Speaking of ignorant, and change.org, I have been informed that they no longer send out the emails.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Oh, okay, well that's good. Wow, you just fessed up to your own ignorance here on the show. It happens.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Well, it's because I ignored them for a while. I didn't care. Ignore ignorant. You know, same word. Same combination.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Humble Bundle, there's another perfect example of places you can get Steam games for dirt cheap.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:34.000
I'm just saying that's the problem. Even comparing the PlayStation Network store or Xbox Live marketplace to Steam is just ridiculous,

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.000
because it's not an open platform as far as you're not going to have competing marketplaces out there.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.000
It's not like the retail marketplace where everyone's competing with each other. You have one central marketplace.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000
You buy it their way, or you don't buy it at all. Origin.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Shadownextgen in our chat says, Skye, couldn't it be said that people originally didn't really know what they were complaining about?

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:00.000
By the way, no I haven't signed the petition, nor do I plan to. I appreciate the devil's advocate perspective.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.000
I know you're an Xbox fan, and unlike some of these people, I do think you do know what you're talking about.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:10.000
So let me humor this opinion here about, didn't we not originally know what we were complaining about?

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:16.000
No, we did. Xbox made it very clear about the restrictions that they were putting into place.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
They have three pages in it.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Yeah, it was that whole official letter they put out there. It was very clear. There was no misinterpreting that.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:30.000
You will have to check in once every 24 hours. You will only be able to trade and use games through authorized vendors and all this stuff.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:41.000
That was in writing. And you can read between the lines and see that that meant that you would not be able to sell games yourself on eBay and so on and so on.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:46.000
The problem is, what they didn't communicate was the positive to offset that negative.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Family sharing was this big cloud out there. Ten people in your house can play the games, but how? What are the terms?

02:23:54.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Because there's literally people out there, and I bet you the people signing this petition think that it was share with people across the internet the full, unhinged, complete game.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Ten people playing it all at once. Now we can all pool in on our game sales. I don't think any of you think that listening to this, but I think there were people out there that really think that.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:21.000
They thought that they could share games. Oh hey, I'm only going to have to pay $6 for this Xbox One game.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:26.000
And nine of my other friends are going to chip in as well and we can all play this game. No, I'm sorry. That's not the way it works.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:30.000
When in reality, it was probably like the GIMP to Drive Club thing, honestly.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:37.000
And seriously, do you really think that Microsoft would legitimately put out a service like that? That they would stand to lose money on?

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:43.000
And they got beat by Sony. Sony took advantage of this. Yes, they did take advantage of this situation.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.000
That's what business is.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:53.000
That is business. And it's, to be fair, it's the exact flip of seven years ago when PlayStation embarrassed themselves at E3.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Anyhow, I wanted to read this comment to, where was it? Oh yes, this is very important.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:07.000
From Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com. Official quote from anti-consumer Blackwolf, with his quotey fingers.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Fuck those fans. Thank you Bobby. We'll end on that note.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Alright, moving on to the Mailbag. It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.000
And if you were one of those people that signed that petition, I invite you to come at me bro.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com. In all seriousness, I could be respectful if you want to have a respectful discussion.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000
But you have to admit that the petition is a little silly at this point. Just let it be.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000
It's an online petition. I mean, come on.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:47.000
You know what? Before the Mailbag, this is important. I would fully support. Fully support.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:53.000
And I think this is what those people would want. So before you write your angry email, I'm gonna meet you halfway here.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:00.000
I would be totally okay with this. With a physical disc license and a digital download license.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:06.000
And if you want to buy your game on physical disc, then game sharing and all that stuff works the way you know it today.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:11.000
And everything is just like, you know, like that shady PlayStation video and all that. Everything you know and love about games.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:18.000
But a digital download license would give you something different. I think that's kind of the place gaming ought to go.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Is that if you download a game, you have the freedom to choose. You get these perks.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Your perk for buying the game digitally is you get it day one without having to leave your...

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.000
You could buy the game without pants. You won't have to leave your house.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.000
And you can give that game to a friend in New York or something cross-country.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000
You know, it would have these different licenses. I am totally okay with that.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:45.000
And I would be behind Xbox One 100% with that. I just don't think it's gonna happen.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.000
And they can always come back. They said that later on they may implement some of the stuff that they got rid of.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Hopefully not all the bad things, but you know.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000
They could just be there trying to find a way to integrate something that won't scare people off.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.000
But I can't support a petition that is like, switch it back to the way it was because everyone's stupid.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.000
We don't like it. We want it this way. But Daddy, I want the kiss that lays the golden eggs.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Alright, let's see what our emailers want this week.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Dark Soccer's gonna dive in head first and find the email she's gonna read now.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Dear OLR.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Looks like this is a bad nut.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Dear OLR, I just wanted to say, as always, that you have an awesome show.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:38.000
I wanted to share with you a game I recently acquired on Steam. It's called Akaneiro Demon Hunters.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.000
It plays a lot like Okami in the sense that you get shards for each demon you killed.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.000
This is a storyline... learn to spell.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Straight. Not with an E, with an A. From Steam.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:55.000
I'm not very good at descriptions, so I took this one from the official game site.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Akaneiro Demon Hunters transports you to a world realized in a striking visual style inspired by Japanese ink, water, and woodblock illustration.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:10.000
We've dug deep into the history and folklore of Japan when designing our scenarios and characters.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Mixing this foundation with an original mythology inspired by Red Riding Hood has yielded a fantastic and inspiring setting for players to explore.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:26.000
It was produced, I think, by Spicy Horse who was in charge of American movies Alice Madness Returns, which is another awesome game by the way.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Hope you guys can check it out. It's on Steam for $10 now.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.000
The graphics are stunning and remind me a lot of Okami as it looks like drawings on the screen.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Hope you guys get to check it out sometime and as always happy gaming and thanks for letting every gamer have a voice. Sincerely, GG.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
You're welcome.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Thank you. I might have to give it a try if I have money.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:50.000
I like hearing about game reviews about games I haven't really heard a lot of, so thank you.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000
This comes from Rob-a-b-b-b-b.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Like Rob, I got caught up in the Steam Trading Cards thingy. It seems to be never ending.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Just for fun, I bought my missing Binding of Isaac cards. Then I converted them to a badge. Not only did that eat all the cards, I got a booster pack soon after with more Binding of Isaac cards.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.000
One of the cards was a foil and so now I have a foil badge to collect.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:23.000
The regular trading cards can power up my existing badge, so there's no reason for selling or trading cards unless they're duplicates.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:30.000
I was using $5 of my own money plus selling my duplicates to obtain a full set. I still have almost $3 left over, pro tip.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Don't try buying the cards at the top of the queue on the marketplace. It will most likely be gone before you can complete your transaction.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:52.000
I don't think the trading card system was running 2-5 July because I paid for hours and got no drops.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Lastly, the cards are worth zooming in on. The Fairy Solitaire cards are actually panoramas from the game. The artwork will probably look way better zoomed in.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:09.000
That is very true. If you are getting those cards, take a minute to actually look at them because there is some really good artwork. Especially if it's a game you really do appreciate.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:14.000
I know we probably don't have a lot of hardcore Fairy Solitaire fans out there. Well, except Dark Sakura.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.000
I'm not really hardcore. I just play it when I get incredibly bored.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:25.000
It is a good game, to be fair. What's the difference between Fairy Solitaire and old school Windows 3.1 Solitaire?

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Well, because it's not exactly Solitaire. It's arranged out a little bit differently.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Yeah, it's a little special. But, anyhow. Yeah, the trading card thing is fun. And, thank you RaBaba for doing trading cards with me last week.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Bronnman sent an email that just said 573. So, maybe we hit our lives.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Did we hit it? Oh, maybe we did. Thank you, Rama. I'm looking now.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:55.000
We have another email that I'm just going to go ahead and read it, but I'm not going to say the guy's full name.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:02.000
So, my name is Jeff Gee, and I've worked at an ESPN affiliate radio station for three years.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:08.000
I've played video games since I can remember. I'm interested in video games radio and would love to send in my resume and some clips of me on air.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Sorry, we're not hiring because we don't pay anything.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.000
I didn't see this email, really.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:19.000
If nothing comes of this email, I would still like to commend you for living the dream of talking about video games.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Well, bless your heart, sir.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
If we could afford to pay, we would be paid.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Yeah, unfortunately, this is an all-volunteer organization, but I will throw this out there.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:43.000
VOG is looking for more shows. Now, we're looking for established shows because we want to make sure that the people we recruit aren't going to throw in the towel after you.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:49.000
I mean, look to the site's credit at Voice of Gee's network. We've had the same lineup for like a year.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000
The shows haven't left, which is a great testament.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Inevitably, some shows are going to throw in the towel eventually. That's just the way things go.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:05.000
But we want to make sure that the shows we get are established shows that will go for a year or two if we're going to invest the promo and so forth in the shows.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:12.000
If you do have a show that's interested in being on the network, get in touch with me directly, robatvognetwork.com.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
I will say this, unfortunately, to this guy.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:20.000
We're not really looking for video game shows right now because we have a bunch between Girls Gone Wow, Horde House, us, Bobby.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:24.000
We're looking for some more general geekdom shows to diversify the palette a little bit.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:28.000
But I could tell you comic book shows are right at the top of the list.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I would love a board game, card game, non-video game type show.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I would love, love, love a show that is larping live or playing a game live, one of those types of shows.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I would make a great cereal. So just throwing that out there.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:53.000
If you have an established show along those lines, get in touch with me, robatvognetwork.com, and we'll see what we can do.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Otherwise, I invite this guy to just join, call our show some night.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:04.000
If you're around on a Sunday night, give our show a call.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Yeah.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Let's talk, we'll be happy to talk video games with you.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
And who knows?

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
For free.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:15.000
And who knows, you know, you might find your niche in the geekdom market too.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:19.000
You know, we might, there's sports geeks out there.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.000
You said you worked for ESPN affiliates, so who knows?

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:26.000
We got sports geek talk as long as there's no wrestling because that would drive Bobby crazy.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Unless it's like 80s wrestling, how could that drive anybody crazy?

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
80s wrestling was the best.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Your theme song has to be Hulk Hogan's, I am a real American.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Cause you know, anyway.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Every week here on the show, oh by the way, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.000
If you would like to send in your mail, please, no resumes.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Here's the FUs of the week time.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:12.000
FU to Bitchface.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:15.000
She doesn't listen to the show.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Some people know who Bitchface is.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
FU.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
And also my hip.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000
And the stupid cough that I am now going on to week five.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Fuck.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Done.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Uh, Logie.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
FU detention headaches.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I always get them.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
And I have one now.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:40.000
I'm going to follow that up with my own FU to headaches.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Cause I had a really bad one yesterday that pretty much ruined my day.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.000
I will say that, but I guess shit happens.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Bradley, do you have any FUs you want to get off your chest?

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.000
FU to my back for hurting after California Extreme yesterday.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000
And then seriously fuck you to this uh,

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Wingstomp employee said they wouldn't take my order cause it's getting late at 1030

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000
when I ordered after 11, 11 like several times.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
He said, we're really late.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.000
And it basically went and just said fuck you to him right there.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Never saying that.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Cause I don't know if it was tone or just he set me off for some reason.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
But that was kind of the stupid answer.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.000
I don't know if there was something going on or they're closing earlier or something.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Don't you dare get between me and my wings.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
It's like a crime.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Yeah.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
All right.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Uh, there it is.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Uh, FUs of the week.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Let's move on with a couple more news stories and then you guys can give us a call in a moment here.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Uh, Loki.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:45.000
You may remember a time when Sony's uh, online network was hacked.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Pepperidge Farm remembers.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.000
And uh, Sony they uh,

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:54.000
they basically got fined in the UK.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Uh, they had to pay a 250,000 pound fine.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:02.000
And they were originally appealing it.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Now they decided they're going to withdraw that.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:09.000
So after careful consideration we are withdrawing our appeal.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:17.000
This decision reflects our commitment to protecting the confidentiality of our network security from disclosures in the course of proceedings.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.000
And we continue to disagree with the decision on the merits.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:29.000
So they're gonna, they disagree but they're gonna pay for it.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.000
We don't like this but we'll do it anyway.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:42.000
I'm wondering if they did appeal it that they would go, maybe there would be some sort of trial where like information would come out about how shoddy their protection was.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:48.000
And they didn't want that so they decided to go ahead and pay the original settlement or something. I don't know, whatever.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Cool. Water in the bridge.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Alright. Although the entire gaming community have probably already forgotten about the hack. Never forget.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:01.000
I shouldn't say the entire community but a big chunk of them.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Rageinator said how about a show that combines wrestling, bronies, and furries.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:08.000
And I said that sounds like really bad porn.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Would that be Dogpile?

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000
It will air at 3am on Tuesday morning.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Yes, we can have the wrestling, bronies, furries show.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:24.000
It will air at 4am on No Day. Ever. In the never.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:33.000
All joking aside, you know, as much as I say we're kind of full up on video game shows right now, I would love to see a Mega Man show. I don't know.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:41.000
But anyway, Mega Man is a die hard community and the community makes a lot of great fan projects.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:45.000
And one of them is on its way out, Mega Man Revolution.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:51.000
It's been in development since 2002. It tries to recreate the magic of the NES games.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.000
You can also, I guess, enable slow down and so forth.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.000
A lot of early reaction. This game is too hard.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:00.000
But also that it's a solid fan game.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:04.000
So you can check that out. MegaManRevolution.com slash download.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:07.000
It is a free download since this is a fan project.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
I haven't seen Capcom trying to shut it down.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:12.000
I guess that's good news. But it's on the internet now so you'll never shut it down.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:15.000
So go enjoy that.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:18.000
I suppose nothing wrong with keeping up the awareness of Mega Man.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Especially with he will be in the next Smash Brothers of course.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Inevitably, Capcom will dust him off and bring him out in another game.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.000
It's gotta happen, right? Someday. Someday.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.000
By the way, I did get sent a picture here.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.000
We did get our 573rd like on Facebook.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Thank you.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I appreciate it. That doesn't mean to stop liking us on Facebook.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Because the next goal would be, what would it be? Probably like 5730?

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:51.000
No, it would be 1337.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Oh, okay. That's an admirable goal.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:39:00.000
And of course, Mega Man Revolution, I would mention that there is also Mega Man Unlimited which was released today.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.000
And you can download that at MegaPhilX.com.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Is that Phil like a dude named Phil or Phil like F-I-L-L?

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Phil like a dude named Phil.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Alrighty. I guess that is about it for the show.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:22.000
But we do want to take an opportunity to open up our skype line for you guys to have your say on anything we've talked about tonight.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Or maybe something we missed. 1877 Game O-L-R or a username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
All one word if you'd like to give us a call.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.000
And we'll talk about whatever you'd like, within reason.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Let's get to some Twitter topics and last minute stories while we wait for those to come in.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Alright, so there's the Tekken Revolution. Remember the free to play Tekken game that's going to be coming out?

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Well, they have a poll up right now for some new candidates, I guess, that are going to be added to the game.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Some of these were kind of B-roll characters that didn't even make it into certain games.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:06.000
For example, there's one character that's a fish. A fish man. And all he can do is flop around.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:11.000
Zombie bride, giant preen mantis, average run of the mill old man.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Yes, he's an old man who can't fight.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:15.000
What about middle aged man?

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
And female Paul.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Let me get to the phones because the phones are ringing here.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:23.000
It's Jason.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Hey, Jason. How you doing?

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Hi, Jason.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Can we go back to Nostalgia Land?

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Of course we can. I love Nostalgia Land.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:37.000
I was driving back from a friend's concert and you guys were going to the mailbag and I was just driving along the highway just going,

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Yeah, right. I know. I want to build a house out of pixels in Nostalgia Land and live there.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:47.000
A fort. I will have my pixel fort in Nostalgia Land.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.000
What do you want to talk about in Nostalgia Land? What makes you nostalgic?

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Prop cycle.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.000
They have one.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Yes. Prop cycle is awesome.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:59.000
They have one. Not in the prop cycle, Addams Family, but they had a prop cycle.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Believe it or not, some of our listeners don't know what prop cycle is, so please explain it.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Prop cycle was an exercise game. Essentially you sat on an exercise bike that had a two-handed flight stick and you could tilt it forward, pull it back, obviously turn right and left.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:25.000
You couldn't just crank the pedals continuously because the game, I think it was basically like exertion prevention built into the game,

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:32.000
but you just pedaled persistently and flew around popping balloons and not crashing into things.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.000
There you go. And it was just a lot of fun to play. It was so silly looking too.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:43.000
It was so fun. Rio Rancho, my hometown, doesn't actually have a mall still to this day.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:49.000
The mall that got closest to us, Cottonwood Mall, is just on the other side of the city limit border.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:55.000
But when that was first built up, the movie theater downstairs had a very tiny little arcade.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:01.000
It had a metal slug, I want to say, a Neo Geo multi-cab, and a couple of other typical things.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:08.000
But upstairs, for the first couple of years of that mall's existence, there was a divided laser tag.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:15.000
Excuse me. A divided laser tag, meaning that you can't cross any of the other person's territory, and it had Sega City.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:23.000
And that was like, with the exception of the roller rink that we used to go to when I was younger, way the hell out in Albuquerque,

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Sega City was like my personal arcade back in the day, and that's where I played Prop Cycle.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.000
And it was one of those things where whenever we would go, I would play that.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:38.000
And it was such a great game, and I always had such a fun time, but as that place declined,

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:46.000
the screen CRT and the general death of that kind of thing just kind of slowly but surely started to whitewash

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:52.000
and fall off and burn in before the entire place just got taken out to pasture.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:59.000
But it was a great game. I've literally never seen that in any other arcade to my mind, to my memory.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Don't they have these weird hacks for Prop Cycle, where they hook up Prop Cycle to other games?

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Like, wouldn't there even be a pinball game that ran off Prop Cycle?

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:15.000
As a matter of fact, my friends out here in Colorado, before I moved out here, hooked up a Poppin' Music of some sort

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:22.000
to the Prop Cycle TV, and they dubbed it Propin' Music.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:23.000
That's awesome.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:28.000
I unfortunately wasn't up here for the occasion, but I saw pictures and it was definitely amazing.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Good times.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.000
There's one game, so I've never known the name of this game.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:43.000
My brain does really weird things when specific details of things go away, and I wonder if you guys know this arcade game.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
I seem to remember it in the roller skating rink that I used to go to as a kid.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Basically, what it boils down to is you're a character that runs around a roller coaster collecting cherries,

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
and you have to dodge the roller coaster.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:03.000
I've never been able to find the actual cars on the roller coaster.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
I've never been able to find this game.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Is that Mr. Do's Wild Ride?

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Mr. Do's Wild Ride.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Sounds like it. If you're collecting cherries, it's Mr. Do.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Come on, Wikipedia. Give me a screenshot and not just the box art.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:26.000
This is the thing that I kind of run into is that the image is ridiculously small.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:33.000
I seem to remember it being very, very circular with ladders that connect you to the different portions.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Yep, that's Mr. Do's Wild Ride.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:36.000
I'm almost positive.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Go to Google.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Check it out on Google. Do a Google search.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Wow, okay, okay. Yeah, this starts a scene.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:51.000
It's so weird because my brain, filling in the gaps now that I actually have game screenshots,

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:59.000
this kind of seems to make sense, but my brain remembers this game looking a little bit better, I guess.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:02.000
A little bit newer than this actually is.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:05.000
The resolution on old games is going to be itty bitty.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Oh, of course.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Yeah, so I think that's part of it.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:09.000
It's all about raster.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Yeah.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
The detail of this thing just seems...

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:15.000
What I remember and what this looks like is entirely different.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.000
I want a classic arcade Smash Brothers game, like with Mr. Do in there.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.000
That also might be the platform you're looking at.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:25.000
I don't know if that screen is an actual arcade shot that you're looking at,

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:29.000
but there was also a Commodore 64 version, so you might be seeing a different version of it.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Oh, wow.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
I'm looking at Rob's image search.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:37.000
There's all these screen captures, and then there's a really badly drawn cock.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
It says you mad on it.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:42.000
What does that have to do with Mr. Do's wild ride? I don't know.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Thank you, Google Images.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Thank you, Google Images.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:48.000
That's what I get for turning safe search off.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
No one wants to search safe. Come on.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:55.000
You can't have your search for a cock in a fair game.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Well, I'm glad we got to play Identify the Classic Arcade Game.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:03.000
I've been meaning to ask somebody about this for literally years.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Dropping back into Nostalgia Land actually reminded me of it.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Maybe Jamie can help me with this one, because she's a big Namco girl.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:17.000
They did a re-release of Pac-Man in some type of anniversary set that not only had Pac-Man,

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:21.000
but it had Dig Dug 2, and it might have had one other game.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:24.000
I don't know if it was a tenth anniversary or a fifteenth anniversary.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
There was some type of anniversary collection that had these games in it,

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:30.000
and they were like up-rezzed. Not like Pac-Mania or anything like that.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:34.000
It was Pac-Man with some subtle differences, but it had Dig Dug in it too,

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
and I really want to play that again.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
It was like a choose-your-game.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:41.000
Yes, it was a choose-your-game, and you could play either Pac-Man or Dig Dug.

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:45.000
I want to say they have one at the Roseville Dave and Busters.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Really?

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:49.000
I want to say. I know I've seen one.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:53.000
I just want to know where I can get the meme wrong. Let's be real.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Anywhere, probably.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Well, I want to know what it's called so I can get it.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
I think it is one of the anniversary editions.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:02.000
I don't remember the name, but I know I've seen one, and I know I've played one.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Okay, I'll have to do some Google-Fu on that because I was thinking of that game earlier.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Anyhow, it was a nice trip down nostalgia lane, Jason.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:16.000
It was. It was a great 20 minutes. A good way to kill my drive.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
No problem. That's what I appreciate about this show.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:21.000
It's a great way to kill a long commuter drive.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:25.000
I'm going to get to see you in a couple weeks, yes?

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Perhaps. Not in Sacramento, I don't think.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:32.000
I'm surprisingly busy considering how long I'm going to be out in the Bay Area,

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:36.000
but yes, I am definitely there for the upcoming con at the start of next month.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Yes, I know you'll be, even if you're not going to GamerX, you'll be in the area,

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:45.000
and I'll be able to meet up with you there, which gives me another opportunity to promote

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:52.000
the little panel dealy going on Saturday at GamerX in San Francisco, August 3rd?

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.000
I think it is the date. It's that Saturday.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:05.000
And I am doing a panel with my buddies from Koopa Club and Game Bar and Game Buoy,

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:08.000
and I know I'm leaving somebody else out, so I apologize in advance,

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:13.000
but all us guys are getting together doing a podcast cross zone panel,

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:18.000
and we're just going to be talking about podcasting, our show is kind of how we got into it,

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:22.000
and trying to enable more people to get their voices heard, so it'll be fun.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Yes.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:24.000
We'll have a gay old time.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:25.000
It'll be a good time.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Yeah, gay meaning happy.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:27.000
You left.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:28.000
All right.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Oh, excuse me. Wow.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
You need to take me to that place in Castro you were talking about earlier, too.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Which place? Hot Cookie?

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:34.000
Um, no.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Oh, Moby Dick.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
The bar with the pinball bar.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:40.000
So it's literally going to become that song that's,

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:45.000
you, I'm going to take you to a gay bar.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
And I'm choking, so have a good night, guys.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:48.000
All right. Bye, Jason.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Thank you for mentioning Hot Cookie, because now I want to go there.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
All right. Let's go to another call on the line.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Hi, this is Azurmay.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Azurmay. Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.000
I was just talking to one of my friends about the show,

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:09.000
and he actually came up and brought up the whole looking for a new show,

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
and we kind of do a show.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:15.000
But it's kind of based off of, like, Japanese culture

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:19.000
and, like, how Japanese culture affects American culture

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.000
with a little bit of, like, learning a little bits of Japanese.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:25.000
We do things through Facebook and Adobe Connect.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Interesting.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
But I was just throwing that, like, out there.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Maybe, like, the chat would be able to see, like,

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.000
if that's something they were interested in listening to.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Well, Pimp, your show, I'm all about support and indie shows.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
Tell us where we can find it.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Okay, well, the name of the actual show is, like,

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Learning Japanese Through Music.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:47.000
And we kind of try to...

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:51.000
You can look on Facebook at facebook.com slash groups,

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Japanese Through Anime,

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
and you can probably see the page there.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:57.000
You can actually add.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
We have, like, Thursday nights.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000
We have, like, a three-hour...

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:06.000
Like, it basically starts out with two hours of, like, a song,

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
and then after, like, the last hour is like a karaoke

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
where we get a chance to sing the song,

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:14.000
but we break down the song and kind of, like, practice Japanese.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Like, last week, the...

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
I don't know if anybody follows the new anime

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
That show is crazy.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
Yeah, well, we broke down the show,

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
and, like, in... Not the show, I'm sorry.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
We broke down the song into, like, different parts

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
and translated it, and then at the end of the show,

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:34.000
we kind of, like, all sing, like, on Adobe Connect.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:37.000
And, you know, we also have a meetup that we also...

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Some of the local people kind of speak, you know,

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:43.000
we meet up in person and kind of sing at, like, karaoke bars, but...

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:46.000
I don't know why, but I love the idea

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
that your show ends with karaoke.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Like, I don't know a lot of shows that do that.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Like, maybe we need to do that here at OLR.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
We end every night with a rousing rendition of

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:02.000
So Long, Farewell, Avita's Ain't Good Night.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
I second the no.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Damn it.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
I'm branching out and doing my own show.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:12.000
You know, the lag kind of, like, throws people off.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
It does give you a chance to learn a little bit more

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:18.000
about the anime or the Japanese pop band

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
that you're probably interested in,

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
and maybe a little few words of Japanese, too, but...

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Well, we do have a show about anime on the network

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
called Anime Jam Session, which is a good time,

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
but it sounds like you have a different approach

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.000
to the way you do it.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:30.000
It sounds like a lot of fun.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
I will have to check that out.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
That sounds fun.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Shoot me an email, robatvognetwork.com,

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
and we'll chat a little more.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Cool.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Well, other than that, that's pretty much it.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
You guys still playing Final Fantasy XIV, right?

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Ready for phase four?

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
I have been playing the shit out of that beta.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
I don't know a better way to put it.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
I literally, I told myself this weekend,

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:52.000
I'm not going to play it.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:53.000
I'm done.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:54.000
I'm just, I'm going to wait for the,

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:55.000
I don't want my character to get erased,

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
and then I'm sitting there and I'm leveling.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
I think I got to level 25,

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:02.000
and I was doing the Totama dungeon this morning,

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
which is like, I mean, there's only one other dungeon

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
in the beta after that, and I just,

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
I'm not going to be able to have enough time to get to that,

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
but I, yeah, I've been playing the shit out of that beta.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
It's a lot of fun.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:13.000
That's cool.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
Okay, great, because, like, I was wondering

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
if you guys had, like, a little group on here

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
that might be doing some sort of, like,

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
free company LOR.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:22.000
We will.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:23.000
We don't have a link shell yet.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:24.000
I actually made one for,

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.000
I did?

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Yes, but link shells are really just chat channels.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:31.000
The free companies are really the, like, guilds,

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:32.000
a la WoW or whatever.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
There will absolutely be something like that.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:37.000
At least Horde House is going to lead one somewhere.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:40.000
I will have more information on that

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:41.000
when we know the full server list.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
Right now we're on Behemoth,

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
but that could change for phase four,

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
but we're going to commit to something soonish here.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
We just want to figure out where our frenzies are going to be

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
and try to pick the best server.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Cool, cool, okay.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
All right, so I'll just continue to just chime in

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
on the network and find out more.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:59.000
We will whore the shit out of it here on OLR

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.000
once the game's out.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:01.000
Awesome.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:02.000
All right, guys.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:03.000
All right.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:04.000
Well, you take care, buddy.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Good luck with your show.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:06.000
Adobe Connect.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:07.000
I have not heard, you know, Adobe Connect,

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
I know because during my day job,

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.000
I'm a corporate trainer,

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:13.000
so I've used Adobe Connect in meetings of that sort,

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:16.000
but I've never heard of doing a podcast through Adobe Connect,

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:17.000
but I'm thinking about it going,

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:18.000
well, it makes sense.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:19.000
It would work.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:20.000
Why not, right?

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:23.000
It's very similar to Google Hangout in many ways.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Yeah, besides the payments,

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
unfortunately it's kind of expensive,

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
like $80 a month,

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:32.000
and you get a chance to utilize some of the tools

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:35.000
like talking through a chat menu,

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
controlling the desktop,

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
and even passing the microphone or the camera

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
to someone else in the chat.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
It's a little bit more interactive.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:47.000
I think that maybe if we moved to something like this

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
we'd probably be dying, you know, so.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Good times.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.000
All right, buddy.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Well, thanks for the call.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Good luck with your show,

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
and we'll talk to you again here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Thanks.

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:57.000
All right, later.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:00.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype,

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:01.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
I just got a tweet.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
I love the interactiveness of the show.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:08.000
I just got a tweet from Gaming Nerd

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
who goes by GNVersion2 on Twitter

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:13.000
that says Namco Classic Collection Volume 2

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:17.000
is a collection featuring Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Rally X,

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
I think that was, yes, the other game,

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.000
in both original and arrangement versions.

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Hold on, I'm Googling this right now

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:24.000
to see if it's what I remember.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Somebody help me fill time while I ask for more calls.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
I probably have that at home, you know,

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
that Namco collection.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Well, I mean, the ones that they released at home,

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:38.000
but yeah, I think I do remember that one

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
because that was it, that was it.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:41.000
Yes, this is it.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
This is totally what I was thinking of.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
You win a cookie.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:46.000
I don't know how to,

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:47.000
I'm gonna shove a cookie through Twitter,

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
and I hope it made it in one piece.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:50.000
That is exactly the game I was thinking of.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:51.000
That person probably already has

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
lots of cookies on their computer.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:54.000
Probably.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
Yes, that is exactly the game I was thinking of.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:57.000
I'm looking at these screenshots.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:58.000
I remember this whole little one

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
with like Pac-Man and the temple

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:01.000
and with the little jumps.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Yep, you, sir, are win.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Thank you.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:10.000
And next, hook me up with a link for a ROM.

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
All right.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
Love the interactiveness here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:15.000
Let's go to the tweets.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:16.000
That was on my personal Twitter,

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
but you know what?

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Sometimes I'm gonna bring up personal stuff on the show

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
because I had to know what game that was.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
Let's go to tweets that went to the OLR account,

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
and then, Loki, I'll go over to you

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:27.000
for some more last-minute stories.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Again, 1877 game OLR or username on Skype,

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to get in on the show.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Sj100matt sent us a tweet that says,

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:37.000
there's a Kickstarter to help open the largest pinball museum

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:38.000
in Southern California, too.

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
You know I got a text message on this.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:41.000
They were at Cosigami Expo.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Melody sent me a text on this,

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:47.000
and I think we might have an interview with them

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:48.000
in the coming weeks.

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
I don't want to promise, but that might actually happen.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:51.000
But you can check that out.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:54.000
They're called Museum of Pinball on Twitter.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:57.000
They've only raised 15,000 out of 150,000,

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
but they've got 24 days to go, so they might make it.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:02.000
But that's pretty awesome.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:03.000
I hope they do it.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:06.000
They're going to build a huge museum of pinball.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
Isn't there already a museum in the Bay Area?

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:09.000
There's also one in Las Vegas.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Yeah?

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
In fact, I've been to the one in Las Vegas

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
before they moved to their newer location,

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
and the one in Las Vegas has a pinball circus

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:20.000
and all kinds of machines you just don't see anywhere.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
All right, some other tweets here.

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
DJ Rama sent us a link about,

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Xbox One gets booed out of Evo while demoing Killer Instinct.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Ouch.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:33.000
This doesn't sound good.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
I'm trying to bring up the story right now.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:39.000
I don't know if the booing is just sensationalism or what,

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:40.000
but let's see.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:44.000
Apparently, fucking ads.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:47.000
I'm having a hard time bringing this up on my phone.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:48.000
Let's see.

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
The Double Helix and Mad Catz guys were at Evo

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:54.000
to pimp fight stick accessories and Killer Instinct,

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:57.000
which, of course, was originally shown at E3,

02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:03.000
and a lot of hostility, I guess, shown at the event,

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:06.000
even though the gameplay for Killer Instinct looked pretty good,

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
and there's a video on there.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:12.000
But then it says the crowd was moderately accepting of Killer Instinct,

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:15.000
but the fact that they were booing the Xbox One at such a core event

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:21.000
like Evo 2013 speaks volumes about what gamers actually feel about the console.

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:22.000
These weren't casuals.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:25.000
These weren't grandpas and grandmas buying consoles for Little Timmy.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
These are the Big Timmies.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:28.000
Hmm.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
The story from Cinnamablend.com.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:33.000
So it just sounds like a few angry mobsters.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:36.000
I don't know how much I...

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.000
I don't know.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:41.000
It sounds like there were just a few angry gaming nerds there,

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:45.000
and, you know, they unfortunately got picked up by the media.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
Ooh, I heard about this.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
Sj100mad is also sending us this tweet.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Even I'm excited about this, and this says a lot.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:56.000
NHL 14, you know, hockey, is going to have an NHL 94 mode,

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:59.000
which is like one of the best games ever, right?

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Complete with original sound effects, controls, and visuals.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Amazing.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:07.000
You know what's sad is that's totally going to sell tons of copies of that game,

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:10.000
because NHL 94 is like one of the best sports games ever.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:14.000
Now, before I give you all those concessions, Sj100mad,

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:15.000
I'm going to say this.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:20.000
NHL 94 is no Blades of Steel, but it's still pretty cool.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
I know a lot of people disagree with me there.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:28.000
AJ Twist wanted to alert us to the Ultra Street Fighter IV game as well.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:36.000
ActDeft is tweeting us about Mane6, who created Fighting is Magic,

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:39.000
is posting progress on their new game.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Didn't they have to do something where they took the license out of it,

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
and now it's like a different type of game?

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:47.000
So I'm trying to scan through the update here real quick.

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:51.000
Did they just change the horses, basically?

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Maybe.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Magical horse fighting game or something now?

02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Well, it's some behind-the-scenes look at Mane6.com.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:01.000
You can check that out there.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
It's a little bit technical.

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:06.000
I was hoping we could see a little more in-game or whatever,

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:10.000
but you can at least see the work that goes into drawing these things.

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:14.000
I guess why it is such a big deal when you have to go back and change the characters.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:18.000
I'm sure ActDeft had something else he wants me to mention on that.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
He'll yell it in chat real quick.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:23.000
But while I'm waiting for that, I will mention TigerClaw's tweet here

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
that says Valve introduces Pipeline,

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:28.000
a program for teens seeking careers in the game industry.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
That's pretty cool.

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:33.000
I'm trying to read more about this here.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:36.000
I get it. Valve, Pipeline. Get it? Get it?

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:41.000
Pipeline is a program for teens seeking careers in the game industry.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
I get it. Get it?

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:47.000
Pipeline is an experiment to see if we can take a group of high school students

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:50.000
with minimal work experience and train them in the skills and methods

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:53.000
necessary to be successful at a company like Valve.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:57.000
There's nothing there yet besides a video and an FAQ,

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
but hopefully that's going to change in the near future,

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
especially as we get into the new school year, right?

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Here we will teach them to make two highly critical games

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:08.000
and then delay the third one forever,

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:12.000
thus building infinite anticipation for said sequel.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:15.000
Yes, these high schoolers will be working on Half-Life 3.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
The next Half-Life 3.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:24.000
Rama in chat helping to clear up about the Fighting is Magic new game.

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:27.000
Lauren Faust is creating new characters for the game

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:31.000
on the Skullgirls engine that they got for free after the Kickstarter.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
Now I remember that. That's right.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
Even though they couldn't use those characters,

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
the creator was going to make new characters,

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:40.000
and then the folks behind Skullgirls were really into it.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:45.000
They're apparently bronies over there at Skullgirls.

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
So that's pretty cool.

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Congrats to all you fans who are going to be in that game.

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
I'm sure you guys will be excited about that.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:55.000
One last call for calls.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:59.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
I'll check in with Loki one more time

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
and see if there's any other last minute stories or what have you.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:04.000
I have nothing.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
Nothing? Yeah, that's it for tweets too.

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:07.000
We running out of show?

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
Must be time to stick a nail in it.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
All right. I guess we're done.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
The Skype line's not ringing.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:14.000
It's over.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
Sorry to those that didn't get through.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:20.000
But, well, I guess maybe I missed you when I was on another call.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:21.000
I don't know.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:22.000
But you can always email us.

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
Or Skype could just be working like Skype.

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
Yeah, that's true.

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Jason in our chat room is piping up saying,

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:35.000
Pipeline isn't going to teach them to make games.

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:39.000
It's going to teach them to make hats, cards, and other trinkets.

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:42.000
You know, this is becoming a more and more popular thing in high schools

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
to take a more trade school approach.

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:47.000
And I honestly, you know, from somebody who just,

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
I've been open about this on the show before.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
I didn't finish college.

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:55.000
And the reason why is because the industry I was studying at the time

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:56.000
was radio and television.

03:01:56.000 --> 03:02:00.000
And after interning at, I almost said what network it was

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:01.000
and I really shouldn't.

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:04.000
But interning at a TV station and doing all this, you know,

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:09.000
stuff in the past, I just felt like I wasn't really going to be happy

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
in that, doing that stuff.

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:16.000
So, this show is kind of a byproduct of what I did get out of college,

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:17.000
which I'm very thankful for.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:21.000
But otherwise, I went into the working world and just worked my way up,

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:22.000
you know.

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
And I think being able to expose high schoolers to like those like really

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:27.000
entry level job skills, I think is a great thing for some people.

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
And I'm not knocking college.

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
College is a great thing for some people.

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:32.000
It just wasn't for me.

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:36.000
I honestly wish that for a lot of fields, especially the one that I'm in,

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:41.000
that it didn't go so much from paying, you know, the $50,000 for college

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:46.000
and went more into, you know, an apprenticeship type environment.

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:49.000
You know, not an unpaid internship because to me that just seems like

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.000
some form of required slavery.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:57.000
But, you know, I think that it should work on, I mean, yeah,

03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:01.000
you need to go to college, like for me, yeah, going to take art history,

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:04.000
going to take anatomy, going to take things are all helpful.

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:07.000
But I think when it comes to actually the industry type of job,

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:10.000
it should be one-on-one working with somebody.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:14.000
You know, some type of, you know, you work as an apprentice,

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:17.000
you become a journeyman, you know, like back in the day.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Anyhow, I don't want people to misunderstand what we're trying to like say here.

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:25.000
OLR is anti-college. No, that's not it. It's just, you know.

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:26.000
I'm having fun at college.

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:27.000
Yeah.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:28.000
I'm not going to a four-year yet.

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:31.000
So, there's many different ways to learn.

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:37.000
Anyhow, that about does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:40.000
I really want to thank you guys for tuning in tonight and supporting the show

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
and supporting independent podcasting.

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:45.000
You know, if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio,

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
please tell a friend or five about the show.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:50.000
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and help grow our family.

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:51.000
We really appreciate it.

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
Bradley, thank you very much for being here tonight.

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
We didn't get to hear a whole lot from you tonight,

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:56.000
but I hope you had fun here on the show.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:57.000
Sure. It was good.

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
And feel free to pop back in any time.

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
It's always a pleasure to have you on.

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:02.000
Yep, yep.

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:03.000
Next time, we'll play a game or something.

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:06.000
You can actually have a little bit more of a say in or something.

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:10.000
But see you hopefully in less than six months.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:11.000
Don't be a stranger.

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:14.000
Any final thoughts you want to get out for the listeners?

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:19.000
Well, after this show, I'm going to probably go see Pacific Rim

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:20.000
because that looks pretty cool.

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:25.000
And it is a goddamn travesty that that fucking Adam Sandler movie

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:28.000
outpaced Pacific Rim. I'm so angry.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
There's so much wrong with America.

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:34.000
Unfortunately, they did not cancel the apocalypse.

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:38.000
Ugh. Horrible. Anyway.

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
Yeah, because there are a lot of dumb people.

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
So, more people need to go see Pacific Rim.

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Do you have anything you want to...

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
You don't really have like a Twitter or anything.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
Do you have any websites you want to pimp or promote while you're here?

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
You don't really have any of that stuff, do you?

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
No. The only thing I really have that's game related

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
is like I have a backloggery thing.

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Oh, okay.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:59.000
I don't really have loads of people on that other than some place.

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:02.000
That's a pretty cool place if you want to list your games,

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
but it takes forever to put them in there

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:07.000
because if they don't have any drop down, you have to put it in yourself.

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:10.000
It tells me to keep up with the million things I'm playing.

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
I have like 400 plus. Let me wear it.

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
Oh, my. 400 plus?

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
483 unfinished games.

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:17.000
Oh, my God.

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
And I bought more already.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
You can really see how far behind you

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:24.000
and how much crap you have on Steam and everything.

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:28.000
Does it make a competition out of like who can catch up on their backlog more?

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:29.000
Does it give you trading cards?

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:30.000
No.

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:31.000
Oh, bummer.

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:37.000
They do have like little icons that show up depending on what you've finished.

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:41.000
Like I have Confused because I have playing 10 plus games at once.

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:45.000
That sounds like me.

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
All right. Well, thanks again for being here.

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:48.000
We'll see you soon.

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
I guess we'll go to Dark Sakura.

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
What's your final thought tonight?

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:57.000
My final thought is I wish I had ice cream.

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:02.000
My final thought tonight is, well, maybe we can give you a Greek yogurt bar.

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:03.000
I mean, it's not ice cream, but.

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
That's okay. Thank you, though.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:06.000
Thought we'd offer.

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:10.000
My other final thought is Shane is trying to course me into doing a Let's Play tonight

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:14.000
on one of the streaming sites, so be looking for that.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:19.000
He wants me to play a game called Slender Man, which is a scary game.

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
Why are you laughing over there?

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:22.000
That'll be funny.

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
So apparently that's going to happen later on.

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
But I do have to work tomorrow, so we can't go too late.

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:29.000
So but stay tuned once I get the show up.

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
If I have some time, I'll maybe go to that.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:32.000
You should just play Surgeon Simulator.

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:33.000
I mean, that's just as funny.

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:34.000
Is it?

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:37.000
And everybody should buy Surgeon Simulator if you haven't yet.

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:40.000
2013 because it's just stupid.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
Is it still three bucks or was that the first four bucks?

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:43.000
It's really cheap.

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:46.000
It's like I have it.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:47.000
I have it in front of me, I think.

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:53.000
Which, by the way, speaking of Let's Play channels, I may be creating my own channel independent of the OLR channel

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:56.000
just because Dar Sakura has her own channel.

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:59.000
And I want to be able to do things that don't necessarily have the OLR name attached to it,

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:03.000
just because, you know, I don't want to be OLRs for all of us.

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:07.000
So we'll have like maybe hopefully I'm hoping we can bring the webcam back.

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:10.000
Streaming the show is in the future and so forth.

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:11.000
But there you go.

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:14.000
Code Man says, can you record it, please?

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
I'm going to try.

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
I don't want to promise tonight.

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:21.000
I feel like I should do a test run of something else tonight and then do Slender Man,

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:27.000
but I am very interested in getting into the YouTube scene of Let's Play.

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:28.000
I'll leave it at that.

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:33.000
I know that the program that you were using before and the one that I'm using still automatically records.

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:34.000
Oh, nice.

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:38.000
I said to make sure I don't have performance suffering because of it, but I shouldn't.

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:39.000
We'll see.

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:40.000
Okay.

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:43.000
Loki, your last, your final thought tonight.

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:46.000
I wish I had no headache.

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:47.000
Oh, you want some ibuprofen?

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:48.000
No, I got it.

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:49.000
I'm going to go home and take them.

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:50.000
All right. I feel better.

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
All right. That does it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
Thank you guys for tuning in and supporting the show.

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:55.000
We really appreciate it.

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:56.000
Have a great week, everybody.

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

03:07:58.000 --> 03:07:59.000
Have a good night.

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:03.000
