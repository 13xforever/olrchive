00:13.903 --> 00:26.515
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, July 21st, 2013, a long-awaited Nintendo Classic finally hits Wii U Virtual Console, a dormant franchise reemerges with a new game announcement at Comic-Con, and things get heated with one EA Sports franchise.

00:31.803 --> 00:37.025
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.085 --> 00:38.946
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.046 --> 00:43.227
[SPEAKER_11]: This is episode number 513 July the 21st, 2013.

00:44.888 --> 00:49.350
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about all things video gaming.

00:49.830 --> 00:50.190
[SPEAKER_11]: TechMasterLoki

01:12.012 --> 01:14.214
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working on a bag of three pounds of gummy bears.

01:14.274 --> 01:18.438
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, you brought a lot of different stuff with you, fun things to the show tonight.

01:18.898 --> 01:24.483
[SPEAKER_11]: One of these things you brought to the studio with you, a giant package of Haribo gummy bears.

01:25.363 --> 01:29.747
[SPEAKER_11]: And not that I'm complaining, gummy bears are amazing, but that's three pounds.

01:29.787 --> 01:30.388
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of...

01:30.908 --> 01:31.588
[SPEAKER_11]: Gummy Bears!

01:59.505 --> 02:01.366
[SPEAKER_11]: and so, you know, it kind of paid for itself.

02:01.466 --> 02:01.926
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

02:01.986 --> 02:05.327
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, gummy bears are always exciting and you know I'm going to steal some before the night is over.

02:05.867 --> 02:13.130
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you've kind of had a busy week and before we get into our gaming weeks and all that stuff, I want to talk to you about some of the variety of things that's gone on this week.

02:13.390 --> 02:17.371
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course, I do want to introduce the always present fourth guest in our show, The Chat Room.

02:18.251 --> 02:28.815
[SPEAKER_11]: We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

02:29.495 --> 02:54.180
[SPEAKER_11]: and uh even though Bobby's opinion on games sometimes can be very wrong uh we do still support all our indie podcast friends even when they don't agree with you that Super Metroid is the greatest game ever made I mean how how geez how can somebody not think that but diversity I suppose we have to embrace a diverse environment all right it's fine it's it's gonna be the greatest game ever made up until Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out and then you know

02:55.420 --> 02:56.420
[SPEAKER_11]: Things might change.

02:56.641 --> 02:59.421
[SPEAKER_11]: You are trying to pressure me into the Grand Theft Auto V. I might have to do it.

02:59.722 --> 03:06.344
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've been taking a break from the MMOs lately because all my friends quit World of Warcraft, basically.

03:06.484 --> 03:07.344
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I shouldn't say all.

03:07.564 --> 03:10.985
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some friends that play World of Warcraft still, but very few.

03:11.105 --> 03:16.227
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I signed in for the first time today in like six days and I had a bunch of friends that were like, oh my gosh, where have you been?

03:17.667 --> 03:22.888
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've been really able to catch up on a lot of single player games like Steam and stuff like that, which I'll get into in my gaming week.

03:22.968 --> 03:26.749
[SPEAKER_11]: But Grand Theft Auto 4 is still sitting there on the list of things I need to do.

03:26.769 --> 03:27.529
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to play it.

03:27.549 --> 03:29.090
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

03:29.190 --> 03:29.650
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I do.

03:30.390 --> 03:30.670
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

03:31.050 --> 03:32.910
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

03:33.150 --> 03:36.091
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma wants to know, are they vodka infused gummy bears?

03:36.691 --> 03:37.151
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not yet.

03:37.171 --> 03:40.252
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's more like heat infused gummy bears that have been sitting in my car.

03:41.072 --> 03:42.373
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've actually seen it before.

03:42.413 --> 03:50.157
[SPEAKER_12]: What happens if they sit in my car for a very long time, it will literally conform to the bag and it'll be just one solid mass of gummy bears.

03:50.357 --> 03:59.102
[SPEAKER_11]: LokiLives46, I don't know if that's in reference to your name or if you just both happen to be Loki, but LokiLives46 says that's almost a gross amount of sugar, man.

04:00.103 --> 04:09.308
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't eat them all in one day because it's seriously, right now it feels like I have a weight in my stomach because I finished eating dinner and then I had this.

04:09.448 --> 04:10.088
[SPEAKER_12]: Star Trek Enterprise

04:31.722 --> 04:35.986
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of those mini... It comes in, like, the plastic bag things, and, you know, it's not too difficult.

04:37.007 --> 04:40.350
[SPEAKER_11]: I was building during Bobby's show, and I'm... Well, not the whole thing, like, last 10 minutes.

04:40.370 --> 04:41.291
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm already almost done.

04:41.631 --> 04:44.453
[SPEAKER_11]: But where did you get this from, and what's been going on?

04:44.594 --> 04:48.517
[SPEAKER_12]: I got it from the Namco Bandai rep, because they came to my work this week.

04:48.917 --> 04:52.400
[SPEAKER_12]: We do this, like, kind of a... Well, it used to be a game summit.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.563
[SPEAKER_12]: Now it's, like, an entertainment summit, because they have a couple movie studios coming.

04:55.603 --> 04:56.604
[SPEAKER_12]: Now there's also the...

04:57.825 --> 05:05.013
[SPEAKER_12]: Other things that we sell as well, including Wonder Chalk, which is like this modeling chocolate stuff now.

05:07.016 --> 05:11.160
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, so they had a bunch of game companies out and stuff, and they show us what's coming out.

05:12.702 --> 05:16.783
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to see a few different... I mean, we'll talk about some of this stuff in Game Week, I guess.

05:16.803 --> 05:18.184
[SPEAKER_12]: But I got to see a few different things.

05:18.644 --> 05:21.664
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a few guys that brought dev kits with them.

05:22.105 --> 05:26.066
[SPEAKER_12]: Ubisoft brought Splinter Cell Blacklist, so I got to play a little of that.

05:27.846 --> 05:31.427
[SPEAKER_12]: Takuma Koei, they brought... What was it?

05:31.527 --> 05:35.568
[SPEAKER_12]: Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z, so I got to play the E3 demo of that.

05:36.428 --> 05:41.770
[SPEAKER_12]: And I didn't actually play it, but Activision brought Skylanders Swap Force...

05:42.670 --> 05:48.053
[SPEAKER_12]: I did follow the toys a little bit because there was no one at the booth at the time.

05:48.133 --> 05:52.715
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was looking at them and the top and bottom halves are held together with magnets.

05:54.135 --> 05:55.156
[SPEAKER_12]: As you would expect, I guess.

05:55.996 --> 05:57.497
[SPEAKER_12]: Magnets, how do they work?

06:00.038 --> 06:05.721
[SPEAKER_12]: I was very disappointed that Disney did not bring their Disney Infinity stuff.

06:06.001 --> 06:07.821
[SPEAKER_12]: They only had a video, which I've already seen.

06:09.582 --> 06:10.403
[SPEAKER_11]: And what else?

06:10.683 --> 06:16.845
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's neat that they were able to bring stuff to your work at all because there's other game stuff going on right now.

06:16.865 --> 06:18.586
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of stuff going on at Comic Con.

06:18.626 --> 06:20.807
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems even more gaming news this year than usual.

06:21.087 --> 06:22.708
[SPEAKER_11]: And then PAX Australia, which...

06:23.968 --> 06:26.469
[SPEAKER_11]: Oddly, haven't been hearing a lot coming out of PAX Australia.

06:40.934 --> 06:46.318
[SPEAKER_11]: There hasn't really been a lot of news broken at PAX Australia, but I'm sure it's been really cool for them to just experience PAX.

06:46.938 --> 06:51.041
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, getting all the nerds in one place and the big gaming rooms and all that.

06:51.121 --> 06:54.203
[SPEAKER_12]: But my favorite part, see, about the whole thing was actually something that didn't even take place.

06:54.263 --> 06:58.506
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it took place at the event, but more of the after event, like the dinner.

06:59.106 --> 07:01.348
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so I have a couple reps that work at different companies.

07:01.548 --> 07:05.551
[SPEAKER_12]: One guy, my friend Daniel, he's worked at a bunch of different companies.

07:05.791 --> 07:07.072
[SPEAKER_12]: I've known him since he's worked at...

07:07.512 --> 07:25.682
[SPEAKER_12]: Konami, Namco, D3, he's working at D3 now and then there's also Len who actually he owns a company now he owns Maximum Games Maximum Family Games they do a lot of like you know family product and

07:26.002 --> 07:26.902
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

07:49.068 --> 07:53.691
[SPEAKER_12]: A long time ago, like back when they were launching the Genesis, you know, a long time ago and stuff.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.072
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they were telling me so many stories.

07:56.512 --> 07:57.673
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just fantastic.

07:57.733 --> 08:15.843
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, Leonard was telling me stories about how, because he, you know, since he owns the company and stuff, they deal a lot with, you know, shipping to Brazil and stuff and about all the difficulties with that and how you get product in there and stuff and how you have to, you know, almost like bribe officials and stuff to get things in there is crazy.

08:15.883 --> 08:15.983
[SPEAKER_12]: But

08:16.904 --> 08:18.805
[SPEAKER_12]: The stories from Sega were great.

08:18.865 --> 08:32.275
[SPEAKER_12]: They were talking about how they came up with... I guess they announced the core system for the Sega Genesis at... Not E3, CES one of these years or something.

08:32.535 --> 08:36.878
[SPEAKER_12]: They were telling... I guess everyone was saying, oh, that's a brilliant idea and stuff.

08:36.918 --> 08:41.702
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it was the first time that they had ever come out with a game system that was actually called a core system.

08:41.762 --> 08:42.122
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of...

08:43.903 --> 08:44.884
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

09:08.157 --> 09:10.940
[SPEAKER_12]: They were asking them, so what do you guys think about the 32X?

09:10.960 --> 09:19.887
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think this is going to be something that's going to work for consumers and stuff and how they're saying it's such a bad idea and everything?

09:21.268 --> 09:21.568
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

09:21.609 --> 09:23.230
[SPEAKER_12]: It just sounded like a lot of fun.

09:23.250 --> 09:35.220
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I could have got the guys on the show to talk about that kind of stuff, but obviously they don't want a lot of the stuff coming back verbatim because some people would get butthurt about that kind of stuff.

09:35.260 --> 09:35.340
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

09:35.632 --> 09:38.293
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, total derailment here, but you're in the background of my vine.

09:38.313 --> 09:39.174
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I still post that?

09:39.354 --> 09:39.894
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I don't care.

09:40.194 --> 09:40.815
[SPEAKER_11]: Just making sure.

09:40.895 --> 09:46.017
[SPEAKER_11]: I always ask permission before I post people's face on the internet, but I wanted to show off my Lego Enterprise because I finished.

09:46.498 --> 09:46.958
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

09:48.258 --> 09:55.062
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm glad you got to reminisce with people and old friends that have moved from company to company and catch up on some of the drums, right?

09:55.262 --> 09:56.164
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's fun.

09:56.645 --> 10:05.179
[SPEAKER_12]: And then also, my other guy, my other friend from, I guess, it's not really a publisher, but he's a rep firm.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.043
[SPEAKER_12]: He works with...

10:09.694 --> 10:10.455
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, what is it now?

10:10.575 --> 10:11.655
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Watten Company.

10:12.376 --> 10:13.336
[SPEAKER_12]: He works with them.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.757
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

10:14.777 --> 10:17.999
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of these guys I've seen for a long time because they've been here every single year.

10:18.039 --> 10:20.800
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a few reps that cycle through and stuff.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.022
[SPEAKER_12]: I did get to meet with Microsoft.

10:23.862 --> 10:24.422
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God.

10:24.562 --> 10:25.183
[SPEAKER_12]: I swear to God.

10:25.443 --> 10:32.507
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing you'll learn about Microsoft if you're in the industry and stuff and if you actually get face-to-face contact with some of these reps...

10:33.428 --> 10:36.212
[SPEAKER_12]: They're different than everybody else.

10:36.452 --> 10:41.399
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll talk to them and you get this vibe from them.

10:42.140 --> 10:45.745
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just very much the Microsoft way of doing things.

10:46.746 --> 10:47.367
[SPEAKER_12]: For example...

10:48.488 --> 10:58.996
[SPEAKER_12]: We were actually sitting down and having lunch, and my coworkers started asking him questions about the Xbox One and all the critical stuff about the Xbox One and stuff.

10:59.036 --> 11:04.980
[SPEAKER_12]: And just listening to the guy spin stuff, I mean, obviously, he's kind of along the lines with how we're thinking.

11:05.540 --> 11:16.107
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really early, and a lot of this stuff is going to change, so he can't really say too much about what it's going to be in the final product, considering that they can just...

11:17.168 --> 11:21.670
[SPEAKER_12]: Turnaround, but just like such the, well, we were listening to the consumers and blah, blah, blah.

11:22.951 --> 11:26.353
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, I set up items for our company.

11:26.533 --> 11:29.254
[SPEAKER_12]: I set up items, and I don't have any of the first-party setup information.

11:29.334 --> 11:34.437
[SPEAKER_12]: So I asked Microsoft, hey, can you provide me a list of the UPCs for the stuff that you have coming out?

11:35.177 --> 11:40.620
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we're sorry, because you see, you guys don't really buy direct from us, so you're going to have to ask somebody else.

11:41.040 --> 11:41.801
[SPEAKER_12]: What the fuck?

11:42.241 --> 11:44.762
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, but we're supporting you guys.

11:44.782 --> 11:45.843
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we're out here today.

11:46.423 --> 11:46.663
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

11:47.464 --> 11:49.305
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, fine.

11:49.385 --> 11:52.827
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't give me stuff to set up the items in our system so that we can sell your product.

11:53.067 --> 11:56.910
[SPEAKER_12]: I just won't bother pushing for that since... Was this not sell your product then?

11:57.330 --> 11:57.810
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

11:58.131 --> 12:00.552
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole thing's a corporate script, Loki.

12:00.572 --> 12:01.473
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ridiculous.

12:01.533 --> 12:07.377
[SPEAKER_11]: This was the weird thing at E3, too, is that there was just such the corporate script that nobody was going to deviate from.

12:08.237 --> 12:10.378
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, everything benefits them.

12:10.698 --> 12:15.480
[SPEAKER_12]: They say they're thinking about the consumer, but it's always what's going to benefit Microsoft.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.660
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what it comes down to.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.422
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's everything that I've talked to them and listening to their spiel and stuff like that.

12:21.502 --> 12:22.883
[SPEAKER_12]: And this isn't something new.

12:22.923 --> 12:26.924
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been around since the first year of Microsoft.

12:28.705 --> 12:31.566
[SPEAKER_12]: It's never about, like, here's the upcoming games we have and stuff like that.

12:32.966 --> 12:34.467
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys need to sell more of our accessories.

12:35.285 --> 12:36.105
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to sell more.

12:36.966 --> 12:39.546
[SPEAKER_12]: This is how you should be upselling these games.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.788
[SPEAKER_12]: When someone orders a Halo 4, you should ask them, do you want a year of live with that too?

12:43.828 --> 12:47.109
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, dude, first off, I'm not selling retail for one.

12:48.369 --> 12:53.291
[SPEAKER_12]: And two, my customers order live cards when they need them and stuff.

12:53.311 --> 12:54.992
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't need to be pushed for that stuff.

12:56.052 --> 12:56.952
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember the first year.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.193
[SPEAKER_12]: This is when the Xbox 360 launched.

13:00.308 --> 13:19.703
[SPEAKER_12]: our guy who is actually higher up now he's like yeah you guys need to be selling you need to be pushing the accessories cool but you're not shipping any to us because they're allocated we want to order them we're trying to sell them but you're not shipping any and now you're telling us that we need to push them but we can't because you're not shipping any to us

13:20.990 --> 13:21.450
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hilarious.

13:24.072 --> 13:25.213
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like banging your head against the wall.

13:26.294 --> 13:28.756
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, it's the line.

13:29.356 --> 13:31.238
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the stuff they're trying to sell and push.

13:31.638 --> 13:34.860
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony on the other end, I must add, asks them the same thing.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.242
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I need setup information for your UPCs.

13:37.462 --> 13:38.463
[SPEAKER_12]: Guy gives me his card.

13:38.503 --> 13:40.825
[SPEAKER_12]: He says, send me an email and I'll get you the information you need.

13:41.465 --> 13:42.446
[SPEAKER_12]: Was that so fucking hard?

13:42.506 --> 13:42.926
[SPEAKER_12]: And guess what?

13:42.946 --> 13:44.407
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't buy direct from them either, so...

13:45.489 --> 13:46.332
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect example.

13:48.057 --> 13:52.130
[SPEAKER_12]: It shouldn't be that difficult to get information from them to sell their product.

13:52.509 --> 13:52.829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

13:52.849 --> 13:54.149
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Jamie.

13:54.169 --> 13:54.810
[SPEAKER_07]: What he just said.

13:54.890 --> 13:55.050
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

13:55.190 --> 13:55.890
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, welcome to the show.

13:55.950 --> 13:57.190
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

13:57.790 --> 13:58.190
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopeful.

13:58.811 --> 13:59.751
[SPEAKER_11]: You smell like sandwich.

13:59.791 --> 14:00.631
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you bring a sandwich?

14:00.651 --> 14:01.291
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought Panda.

14:01.491 --> 14:02.251
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

14:02.511 --> 14:02.932
[SPEAKER_11]: You were so wrong.

14:02.952 --> 14:03.792
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't eaten all day.

14:04.032 --> 14:04.472
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

14:04.672 --> 14:05.032
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

14:05.352 --> 14:05.612
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

14:06.412 --> 14:11.474
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, one other thing I want to ask you about, especially now that DarkSakura's here to hear this, the Ouya thing you've been tweeting about.

14:11.554 --> 14:11.754
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

14:11.814 --> 14:12.414
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, come on.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.474
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with the Ouya stuff?

14:13.494 --> 14:19.576
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so since I've gotten my Ouya, I don't even know if you've noticed on that controller that since you're borrowing the system now...

14:20.996 --> 14:22.197
[SPEAKER_12]: The analog sticks are fucked up.

14:45.632 --> 14:47.714
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it was a defect.

14:47.794 --> 14:50.497
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a defect that was in the first run of those controllers.

14:51.578 --> 14:55.962
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's something that's documented, and it's something I tested, and I saw the same thing that they came up with.

14:56.502 --> 15:02.848
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've been trying to get it replaced recently, because I know they've been busy with the launch and stuff, and it's just getting a hold of customer service.

15:03.329 --> 15:09.355
[SPEAKER_12]: I started my claim, or I should say my support ticket, back in June, on the 25th.

15:11.691 --> 15:16.177
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first response I got from them was kind of a canned response.

15:16.197 --> 15:18.520
[SPEAKER_12]: Because everyone's asking, you know, where's my Ouya system?

15:18.700 --> 15:25.309
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was all this information about, you know, when your Ouya system's coming and how to track it and all that stuff.

15:25.329 --> 15:25.930
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, well...

15:27.111 --> 15:28.192
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

15:43.801 --> 15:45.302
[SPEAKER_12]: I keep responding back to the thread.

15:45.322 --> 15:48.225
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, hey, where do we go from here?

15:48.806 --> 15:49.526
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going on here?

15:50.087 --> 15:52.009
[SPEAKER_12]: And so then finally I get a response back.

15:52.849 --> 15:59.496
[SPEAKER_12]: Your replacement faceplates have been sent out because I guess there's some problem with some of the faceplates and so people are requesting the faceplates.

16:00.828 --> 16:01.308
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

16:18.900 --> 16:19.000
[SPEAKER_11]: E.A.'

16:18.980 --> 16:19.321
[SPEAKER_11]: 's does that

16:35.513 --> 16:42.979
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying, so it took me filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, which they already have, you know, looks like a few complaints against them already.

16:43.120 --> 16:48.404
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not part of the Better Business Bureau yet.

16:49.165 --> 16:50.566
[SPEAKER_12]: And that didn't really do anything.

16:50.626 --> 16:53.348
[SPEAKER_12]: So then I had to complain on Facebook or Twitter.

16:53.949 --> 16:59.153
[SPEAKER_12]: And so finally got the attention of their community manager.

16:59.193 --> 17:01.135
[SPEAKER_12]: And she kind of got the ball rolling a little bit.

17:01.175 --> 17:03.357
[SPEAKER_12]: And I finally got another response saying that I was supposed to be

17:03.977 --> 17:06.439
[SPEAKER_12]: He's forwarding my thing to the RMA department.

17:06.479 --> 17:09.101
[SPEAKER_12]: So still, I don't have a fixed controller.

17:09.241 --> 17:11.203
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, literally, I could have gone out to the store.

17:11.983 --> 17:22.271
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the right way to do it, but I could have gone to the store, bought a brand new Ouya controller, and took it back, took my old controller back as defective, and got my money back, and could have had it replaced weeks ago.

17:22.391 --> 17:25.814
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I wanted to do it through the proper channels.

17:26.334 --> 17:29.196
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, if I get dicked around for another couple weeks, I am going to do that.

17:29.517 --> 17:31.258
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's where I'm at.

17:31.278 --> 17:32.559
[SPEAKER_12]: I still don't have a fixed controller yet.

17:35.399 --> 17:35.940
[SPEAKER_12]: What a mess.

17:36.640 --> 17:36.821
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

17:37.061 --> 17:38.462
[SPEAKER_11]: Customer service is so important.

17:38.482 --> 17:41.125
[SPEAKER_12]: Their customer service is absolutely terrible.

17:41.405 --> 17:44.268
[SPEAKER_12]: And this goes just the full gamut.

17:44.328 --> 17:46.690
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not been good at all.

17:46.971 --> 17:49.193
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I understand that they're a new company, but come on, man.

17:49.333 --> 17:52.656
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been dealing with customer service issues for the last three months now.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.259
[SPEAKER_12]: They should be a little bit more on top of it.

17:55.319 --> 17:55.539
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean...

17:56.680 --> 17:59.783
[SPEAKER_12]: Just even getting back to people in a timely manner.

18:00.243 --> 18:01.784
[SPEAKER_12]: Or reading the email.

18:01.924 --> 18:06.768
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're going to respond back to somebody, read through what the whole problem is.

18:06.828 --> 18:10.831
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're saying, oh, I'm going to send you replacement faceplates, that's not going to fucking fix the problem.

18:11.932 --> 18:12.292
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

18:12.412 --> 18:14.274
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just strange.

18:14.934 --> 18:15.094
[SPEAKER_12]: But...

18:16.755 --> 18:20.437
[SPEAKER_12]: And now they've got some more news about what they're trying to do to drive up sales and stuff.

18:20.738 --> 18:27.922
[SPEAKER_12]: And even their response to the NPD numbers this month, they're saying, oh yeah, the Ouya launch hasn't been very successful because they haven't sold that many units.

18:27.942 --> 18:29.503
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're like, well, we sold out of all of our units.

18:29.523 --> 18:30.723
[SPEAKER_12]: We're chasing demand right now.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.985
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because your manufacturing is so fucking slow.

18:33.665 --> 18:34.966
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know.

18:35.066 --> 18:38.248
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just kind of over that system already.

18:38.268 --> 18:41.910
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of felt like it was a whole mistake to back it in the first place.

18:42.390 --> 18:43.591
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Dan said he wanted one now.

18:45.154 --> 18:46.855
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, no, we're not getting one.

18:47.255 --> 18:48.655
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm putting my foot down.

18:49.135 --> 18:50.556
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not terrible.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.817
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's going to get better because it's just a system right now.

18:53.837 --> 18:58.379
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all up to the developers and what they're coming out with and stuff.

18:58.399 --> 19:02.700
[SPEAKER_12]: And they even had some stuff that came out of their little game jam thing that they did that looked really cool.

19:03.320 --> 19:05.541
[SPEAKER_12]: But not a lot of it's actually been made yet.

19:05.581 --> 19:08.082
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a game called Television that I wanted to play.

19:08.102 --> 19:09.143
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of this weird...

19:11.604 --> 19:12.584
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

19:29.774 --> 19:33.256
[SPEAKER_12]: and hell, it can't even access, you know, external storage devices yet.

19:33.656 --> 19:34.737
[SPEAKER_12]: None of that stuff's happened.

19:36.118 --> 19:40.840
[SPEAKER_12]: It can't, you know, it doesn't have any sort of online multiplayer.

19:40.880 --> 19:45.883
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no, like, any, you know, sharing of, like, there's no friends-less things built into it.

19:45.923 --> 19:46.463
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing.

19:46.523 --> 19:49.345
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just very rushed, I guess.

19:51.558 --> 19:55.121
[SPEAKER_11]: WhatUpG asks in chat, who has great customer service?

19:55.721 --> 19:56.782
[SPEAKER_11]: I can think of a few companies.

19:58.123 --> 20:01.866
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say my car insurance company, AAA, has always been really good to me.

20:02.546 --> 20:04.167
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't really complain about them at all.

20:04.888 --> 20:07.089
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say the masters of customer service.

20:07.129 --> 20:08.390
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen anyone do it better.

20:08.530 --> 20:08.871
[SPEAKER_11]: Disney.

20:09.491 --> 20:09.991
[SPEAKER_07]: Disneyland.

20:10.031 --> 20:14.595
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm saying as far as game industry, I actually had really good customer service with Blizzard.

20:14.715 --> 20:14.855
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

20:16.736 --> 20:18.057
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a few times I've had to call.

20:18.077 --> 20:18.937
[SPEAKER_07]: I had really good service.

20:19.057 --> 20:27.502
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like how long I've had to wait in some of the hold times, but once you get through to somebody, yeah, my experiences with Blizzard has been good.

20:28.482 --> 20:29.123
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't complain.

20:29.763 --> 20:38.247
[SPEAKER_12]: The best, or one of the best, is supposed to be Zappos, but I've never really ordered from them, although I've met the people at the company, and they're all really great.

20:38.287 --> 20:39.308
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all shoes, right?

20:39.848 --> 20:42.711
[SPEAKER_12]: Their shoes and clothing and stuff, they did get into electronics for a while.

20:42.731 --> 20:46.334
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually sold them games for a little bit, but they're really great.

20:46.434 --> 20:48.876
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, just everybody there is fantastic.

20:49.336 --> 20:51.298
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a very unique corporate culture, too.

20:51.318 --> 20:51.618
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

20:51.638 --> 20:52.258
[SPEAKER_11]: It really works for them.

20:52.278 --> 20:53.139
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really cool.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.182
[SPEAKER_12]: None of the executives have offices there.

20:56.262 --> 20:59.564
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all down there in cubicles with everybody, and it's just very...

21:00.405 --> 21:04.787
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good morale, and just everybody is really happy to work there, and I think that's how you do it.

21:04.807 --> 21:08.208
[SPEAKER_12]: You keep people happy, and they will be happy.

21:08.228 --> 21:11.529
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if they're pissed off at their job, they're not going to be happy to your customers.

21:12.509 --> 21:16.570
[SPEAKER_07]: The place that I just got hired for believes the same thing, and everyone looks super happy there.

21:16.590 --> 21:18.191
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say where I got hired, but still.

21:19.146 --> 21:23.407
[SPEAKER_11]: Technus in chat says, Costco has amazing customer service, returns with no question asked.

21:24.287 --> 21:26.587
[SPEAKER_11]: They changed some of that policy lately.

21:26.607 --> 21:32.208
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think they still probably have the most liberal return policy in most companies, but it's not as crazy as it used to be.

21:33.169 --> 21:35.189
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiger Claw asks, Rob, you're a corporate trainer.

21:35.249 --> 21:36.569
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you teach customer service?

21:37.069 --> 21:38.710
[SPEAKER_11]: I did for seven years.

21:39.070 --> 21:46.151
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously, just due to separating my day job and my hobby, I'm not going to tell you where I work or much more than that.

21:46.671 --> 22:13.916
[SPEAKER_11]: but yes I taught customer service for seven years and I actually still even though I am still a corporate trainer I teach something else I sometimes teach customer service elements and I still write some manuals relating to that but so that's why it's important to me and I think you know a lot of companies I hate it when they let it go because one of the biggest things about customer service is just having to have the mentality like I want to do good things

22:15.016 --> 22:16.638
[SPEAKER_11]: That's 90% of it right there.

22:17.238 --> 22:20.821
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, I won't get into too much more than that.

22:21.782 --> 22:23.763
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people in chat saying Amazon.

22:24.404 --> 22:26.425
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma saying Newegg is great customer service.

22:26.485 --> 22:28.687
[SPEAKER_11]: Bonds006 says, how can I forget Nintendo?

22:28.707 --> 22:29.648
[SPEAKER_11]: They have yet to let me down.

22:31.189 --> 22:34.352
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've worked in customer service for a solid eight years.

22:34.792 --> 22:38.535
[SPEAKER_07]: So trust me, when you're in it, you know what not to do.

22:38.555 --> 22:38.755
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

22:39.756 --> 22:40.936
[SPEAKER_07]: I've called people out on stuff.

22:42.597 --> 22:48.058
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I've actually, when I get good phone service, which I can't remember the last company I got it from.

22:48.098 --> 22:51.279
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just been, I don't actually call places a whole lot.

22:51.299 --> 22:53.480
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of prefer to do interactions online myself.

22:54.420 --> 23:00.441
[SPEAKER_11]: But the last time I called somebody, I got such good customer service, I actually said, can I talk to your manager and leave a compliment?

23:00.741 --> 23:01.602
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I usually do?

23:01.702 --> 23:03.142
[SPEAKER_11]: They love that.

23:03.712 --> 23:04.593
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, you know what's even better?

23:05.073 --> 23:08.255
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like someone's job, ask for the fax number, fax them a letter.

23:09.235 --> 23:17.560
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when I worked in customer service before, verbal compliments were really good, but written compliments were like the gold star.

23:17.620 --> 23:18.700
[SPEAKER_07]: They were the diamond star.

23:18.840 --> 23:24.824
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're willing to do that, not waste your time, spend your time doing something like that.

23:25.244 --> 23:26.845
[SPEAKER_07]: I got 14 of them in one year.

23:27.525 --> 23:29.026
[SPEAKER_07]: I got taken out to dinner five times.

23:29.046 --> 23:30.207
[SPEAKER_11]: Little this show off.

23:30.287 --> 23:33.650
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was that one year that we were so super busy and I worked all that overtime.

23:34.250 --> 23:40.034
[SPEAKER_07]: But I actually just sort of gave up on the call time and ended up helping out whoever it was because it was really freaking busy.

23:40.835 --> 23:42.616
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's one thing when you have 255 calls in queue.

23:42.636 --> 23:43.516
[SPEAKER_07]: When your queue max is 255.

23:43.556 --> 23:43.777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

23:43.837 --> 23:43.937
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

23:48.553 --> 23:50.034
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I don't know how we got on that tangent.

23:50.054 --> 23:50.815
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, OUYA stuff.

23:50.855 --> 23:56.461
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, anything else about your antics this week you want to share with us, Loki, before we get into Gaming Weeks?

23:57.001 --> 23:57.642
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much it.

23:57.742 --> 24:02.006
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get into how was your Gaming Week and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.

24:02.366 --> 24:03.287
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

24:03.527 --> 24:04.088
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Crossing.

24:04.808 --> 24:05.089
[SPEAKER_11]: Still?

24:05.629 --> 24:05.829
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

24:06.130 --> 24:07.131
[SPEAKER_11]: Is my DS around?

24:07.151 --> 24:08.252
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta make sure our 3DS is mate.

24:09.753 --> 24:10.374
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned mine on.

24:11.054 --> 24:11.735
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine's been on all day.

24:11.895 --> 24:15.497
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, when I went to South Sac yesterday, I street passed two people there.

24:16.078 --> 24:20.161
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea who, but there were two people in South Sac, so if you're listening, I street passed you totally.

24:22.282 --> 24:26.445
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, yeah, I actually, let's see, I've just expanded my second room.

24:27.065 --> 24:32.850
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've expanded my upstairs, I've expanded my house twice, the upstairs once, and

24:33.470 --> 24:37.712
[SPEAKER_07]: My side room once, my other side room once, and I'm going to be expanding my basement.

24:37.732 --> 24:39.672
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like 56,000 bills left.

24:40.933 --> 24:43.253
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyone who wants a tip, fish on the island.

24:43.994 --> 24:45.454
[SPEAKER_07]: Fish on the island, cat sharks.

24:46.175 --> 24:48.215
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw everything back if they're not a shark.

24:48.535 --> 24:50.096
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard beetles on the island.

24:50.436 --> 24:51.696
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, some of the Beatles, not all of them.

24:52.557 --> 24:53.737
[SPEAKER_07]: The Goliath ones are worth some money.

24:55.437 --> 24:58.558
[SPEAKER_07]: And I finished Little Inferno.

24:59.318 --> 25:00.298
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is weird.

25:01.379 --> 25:02.799
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the one where you set things on fire, right?

25:02.819 --> 25:03.559
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I love that game.

25:03.619 --> 25:04.019
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.360
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really about it because I've been job interviewing.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.821
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been shopping for professional clothes.

25:10.941 --> 25:12.441
[SPEAKER_11]: But congrats, you got the job.

25:12.521 --> 25:15.122
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know you don't want to say, well, you'll tell me all about it off air, but...

25:15.464 --> 25:15.804
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

25:39.772 --> 25:42.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what a positive time between that and the house stuff.

25:42.813 --> 25:46.975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we found two really good houses today, and we put out an offer on one of them today.

25:47.155 --> 25:47.375
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

25:47.835 --> 25:50.556
[SPEAKER_07]: And a little two-bedroom house, but we have a big office in it.

25:51.376 --> 25:52.016
[SPEAKER_11]: Fingers and toes crossed.

25:52.036 --> 25:53.017
[SPEAKER_07]: And my own bathroom.

25:54.517 --> 25:54.797
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

25:54.837 --> 25:55.978
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

25:56.018 --> 25:57.898
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the one out, I guess I can say Antelope?

25:57.918 --> 25:58.478
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that the one in Antelope?

25:58.518 --> 25:59.078
[SPEAKER_11]: In Antelope.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.139
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be a bit of a drive.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.800
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be a schlep, but it'd be a watt to 50 for me to get to work.

26:02.820 --> 26:03.360
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not bad.

26:03.960 --> 26:07.345
[SPEAKER_11]: E3 demo for Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z

26:20.083 --> 26:20.884
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26:47.084 --> 26:54.949
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and said somehow it let me kill the zombie and then I couldn't finish the demo, which is kind of funny, but I've already seen how it ends.

26:54.989 --> 26:56.350
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it wasn't that big deal.

26:57.450 --> 27:06.576
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and then I played a bit of a Splinter Cell Conviction, which honestly I have, um, or not conviction, Splinter Cell Blacklist.

27:07.136 --> 27:07.656
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a new one.

27:08.577 --> 27:08.677
[SPEAKER_12]: Um,

27:10.518 --> 27:10.958
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

27:29.515 --> 27:29.936
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

27:48.715 --> 27:49.135
[SPEAKER_12]: And what else?

27:49.495 --> 27:51.036
[SPEAKER_12]: I played more Super Meat Boy.

27:52.957 --> 27:56.818
[SPEAKER_12]: I pretty much got all the A-pluses for the first level.

27:57.478 --> 28:00.640
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm working on the second level, and that includes both Dark and Light worlds.

28:01.440 --> 28:05.341
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got all of the bandages.

28:05.922 --> 28:09.083
[SPEAKER_12]: So now I have... Who did I unlock?

28:09.363 --> 28:13.004
[SPEAKER_12]: I unlocked the robot from Macarium, I think.

28:13.144 --> 28:14.445
[SPEAKER_12]: And then also...

28:16.807 --> 28:21.397
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, what's his name from, um... I don't even remember now who it was.

28:21.978 --> 28:23.321
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a bunch of other characters.

28:23.422 --> 28:25.165
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the alien from Alien Hominid.

28:26.067 --> 28:26.709
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um...

28:28.416 --> 28:29.297
[SPEAKER_12]: Some other character.

28:29.317 --> 28:30.217
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know who it is.

28:30.237 --> 28:31.398
[SPEAKER_12]: It's from some other indie game.

28:32.398 --> 28:38.202
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to get the guy from Minecraft because he has the coolest kind of special attack.

28:38.522 --> 28:39.743
[SPEAKER_12]: You can actually dig through the level.

28:40.463 --> 28:46.767
[SPEAKER_11]: ShadowNextGen in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Loki, the mark and shoot mechanic was also in Splinter Cell Conviction.

28:46.807 --> 28:47.427
[SPEAKER_11]: You should check it out.

28:48.268 --> 28:48.428
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

28:51.883 --> 28:59.386
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, before the show, I got sent the beta for Mercenary Kings, which is a game I backed on Kickstarter.

29:01.026 --> 29:01.667
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's awesome.

29:01.887 --> 29:09.069
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks very much like a metal slug, but it's not.

29:09.569 --> 29:12.871
[SPEAKER_12]: You can craft weapons in the game because you collect things.

29:13.291 --> 29:18.292
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really hard and all really awesome hand-drawn pixel art.

29:19.533 --> 29:19.613
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

29:21.587 --> 29:21.867
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.830
[SPEAKER_12]: I played it for about 15 minutes and it was pretty sweet.

29:25.090 --> 29:28.253
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just I never finished the first level because I had no fucking clue where I was supposed to be going.

29:28.273 --> 29:33.457
[SPEAKER_12]: I was supposed to be rescuing one guy and I went all through the level because it kind of plays a little Metroidvania, I guess.

29:33.878 --> 29:44.487
[SPEAKER_12]: They're very open levels, but since I have no map or don't know where I'm supposed to be going, I kind of wandered the level for a while and couldn't find who I was supposed to be rescuing because you have a time limit.

29:45.568 --> 29:45.648
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

29:47.165 --> 29:47.886
[SPEAKER_12]: Shadowrun Returns

30:03.345 --> 30:05.747
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to check on Shadowgate returns.

30:06.167 --> 30:07.148
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I backed that kickstart.

30:07.188 --> 30:08.789
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only backed like two maybe.

30:09.109 --> 30:09.429
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, no.

30:09.649 --> 30:13.352
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there were the two recently because we had them both on the network that I backed.

30:13.692 --> 30:20.397
[SPEAKER_11]: But then there was also, you know, I'm starting to see the rewards for GamerCon, or as they call it, GamerX, is next weekend.

30:20.738 --> 30:22.399
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like actually happening, which is pretty cool.

30:22.419 --> 30:25.481
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just financing the reaping the rewards of that.

30:25.801 --> 30:31.646
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Shadowgate was the only other thing I've ever kickstarted outside of the Professor Shy Guy thing.

30:33.067 --> 30:43.353
[SPEAKER_12]: so I'm still waiting for that to come out which I think is later this year so I'm excited about that yeah so um I think that's all I played this week I didn't I wanted to play some other stuff I installed a few games um

30:45.402 --> 30:46.242
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, that's it.

30:46.583 --> 30:50.705
[SPEAKER_12]: Although there's going to be lots of taking up of time, so I don't know if I'll get into a lot of these games.

30:51.245 --> 30:55.187
[SPEAKER_12]: Saints Row the Third, still have a few achievements left I need to get.

30:56.447 --> 30:56.727
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

30:57.588 --> 30:58.308
[SPEAKER_11]: So my gaming week.

30:58.508 --> 31:01.710
[SPEAKER_11]: I've played quite a bit of different things, just kind of like a potpourri of stuff.

31:01.930 --> 31:05.912
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think not playing MMOs right now because I'm kind of holding out.

31:06.012 --> 31:14.956
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn is going to be the next big thing I get sucked into, but it's not really out until mid-August, whenever the early launch and the next beta phase happen and all that.

31:15.416 --> 31:16.897
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm kind of in this lull right now.

31:16.937 --> 31:20.698
[SPEAKER_11]: World of Warcraft, most of my friends are on hiatus.

31:20.738 --> 31:24.619
[SPEAKER_11]: They've either just gone off to play other things or they're going to play XIV or they quit or whatever.

31:24.999 --> 31:26.840
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just not a lot of people still playing WoW.

31:26.860 --> 31:29.861
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just a couple people I still run into, but not a lot.

31:29.901 --> 31:35.923
[SPEAKER_11]: So I sign into WoW maybe once every few days, play a PvP Battleground, try to talk to people, but that's about it.

31:36.383 --> 31:38.964
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've been using this time to kind of catch up on single player things.

31:39.484 --> 31:42.004
[SPEAKER_11]: And Steam sale obviously has been a huge contributor to that.

31:42.784 --> 31:44.185
[SPEAKER_11]: The trading card metagame.

31:44.645 --> 31:47.485
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually did my badge today for the summer sale.

31:47.505 --> 31:50.886
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got my summer sale badge and it gave me a friends list boost to five people.

31:51.446 --> 31:52.566
[SPEAKER_11]: Not everybody would get that.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.547
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just I think you get like a random loot.

31:54.847 --> 31:56.227
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got a background for my profile.

31:56.247 --> 32:00.668
[SPEAKER_11]: So now when you go visit my profile on Steam, which is I think GreenSky42 is my external name.

32:01.528 --> 32:05.189
[SPEAKER_11]: You can actually see like my little trading card backgrounds, you know, just silly thing.

32:07.310 --> 32:08.630
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, there was that.

32:09.471 --> 32:11.871
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to that, I kind of was playing some more games on Steam.

32:12.672 --> 32:19.094
[SPEAKER_11]: A few things to note, Skyrim, I started randomly playing the other night because, you know, Skyrim is that game you can just get sucked into.

32:19.134 --> 32:20.215
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, cards, partially cards.

32:20.455 --> 32:22.356
[SPEAKER_11]: I got all of my cards in one sitting.

32:22.596 --> 32:25.737
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll tell you how I got sucked into Skyrim one night, right?

32:26.337 --> 32:26.998
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's that.

32:27.558 --> 32:29.799
[SPEAKER_11]: But then the other game I got really sucked into, Torchlight 2.

32:30.979 --> 32:34.482
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought it I didn't play it, but I bought it

32:53.539 --> 32:54.300
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

33:10.856 --> 33:11.236
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

33:13.157 --> 33:19.699
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of live streaming, after the show last week, Shane made me play Slender the Eight Pages and do a live stream.

33:20.359 --> 33:21.000
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

33:21.020 --> 33:23.461
[SPEAKER_11]: That game was scary.

33:23.781 --> 33:24.841
[SPEAKER_11]: But I beat his score.

33:25.181 --> 33:26.842
[SPEAKER_11]: He's only gone as far as two pages.

33:26.982 --> 33:29.823
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to three pages by sheer dumb luck.

33:30.403 --> 33:38.608
[SPEAKER_11]: and I live streamed the whole thing and I had the lights out so like all you could see is my silhouette and the lights from Alan's computer because I had like my little webcam in the corner.

33:38.848 --> 33:46.753
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all in the archive on my channel at Twitch TV Rob Roberts and I did have a jump scream where I literally screamed once.

33:47.373 --> 34:11.831
[SPEAKER_11]: and uh Shay I just he started laughing and then I bust up laughing it was really funny but it was scary like I was in this like bathroom area looking for a page and I turned the corner and he was right there and the music did the bong and like the tentacles were coming out and everything it was like ah so I let out this big screech so that was fun uh even though you know I probably won't play that again anytime soon but that was that was a good thrill for that

34:12.285 --> 34:13.326
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy VII Final Fantasy VII

34:39.901 --> 35:02.677
[SPEAKER_11]: but the whole cloud saving feature is busted and I don't know if it's just because so many people bought it when it went on the flash sale yesterday but like I could not save my game yesterday that's very frustrating and stupid like if the cloud thing doesn't work the game should still let you save locally by default but I could not say and I streamed this whole thing happening I couldn't save to a local file that's ridiculous come on

35:03.517 --> 35:10.584
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize that Square's trying to tie everything together online to do the boost level thing and everything, but it's ridiculous.

35:10.604 --> 35:14.347
[SPEAKER_12]: It should always save locally and then to the cloud.

35:14.387 --> 35:15.188
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, right?

35:15.868 --> 35:21.073
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to really dog Final Fantasy VII for that cloud-saving thing because it does more harm than good in this case.

35:21.514 --> 35:24.897
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping they fix it, but it did not leave a good impression.

35:25.197 --> 35:28.560
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wants to replay the first hour of the game again?

35:28.820 --> 35:29.260
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, well...

35:29.941 --> 35:31.983
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I did play it for the first time.

35:32.003 --> 35:33.644
[SPEAKER_11]: But like the first time in a few years.

35:34.765 --> 35:36.386
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the first time since yesterday.

35:38.368 --> 35:43.292
[SPEAKER_11]: Jason in our chatroom, VXJasonXV at live.vognetwork.com says, Cloud can't save Aeris.

35:43.332 --> 35:44.713
[SPEAKER_11]: You expect him to save your game?

35:46.294 --> 35:46.655
[SPEAKER_11]: Lol.

35:47.355 --> 35:47.896
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope.

35:48.356 --> 35:49.397
[SPEAKER_07]: My cloud would have stabbed her.

35:52.785 --> 35:53.185
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

35:53.325 --> 35:54.406
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also looking here.

35:54.486 --> 35:57.587
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw says Rob needs to play more scary games on Twitch.

35:58.168 --> 35:58.968
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a possibility.

35:59.008 --> 35:59.709
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a possibility.

36:00.089 --> 36:01.410
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to play a variety of things.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.590
[SPEAKER_11]: Just sometimes classic things.

36:02.610 --> 36:05.632
[SPEAKER_12]: Too bad you don't have the Oculus Rift and then play like a Slender game.

36:05.792 --> 36:06.313
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

36:06.333 --> 36:07.974
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, by the way, Rob?

36:08.094 --> 36:11.296
[SPEAKER_07]: I did remember one other video game related thing we did last night.

36:12.036 --> 36:13.677
[SPEAKER_07]: We watched the live stream of Video Games Live.

36:14.582 --> 36:16.908
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I saw part of that.

36:17.068 --> 36:20.096
[SPEAKER_11]: I decided to stream at the same time it was on, which is probably why nobody was watching.

36:20.517 --> 36:21.940
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm amused by David Hader's ponytail.

36:23.539 --> 36:29.522
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember what I used because my computer I had to format the hard drive so I don't have my program anymore

36:51.214 --> 36:53.836
[SPEAKER_11]: FFSplit, I did not get as good a performance out of that as I did.

36:53.956 --> 37:01.221
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's nice because that's free and everything, but I got a better performance out of OBS.

37:01.261 --> 37:01.681
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

37:01.902 --> 37:11.048
[SPEAKER_11]: Also trying to read through our chat room real quick at live.vognetwork.com I guess that's it for now for chat comments, but we'll get some more of these later.

37:11.248 --> 37:13.170
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks commenting on a story that's coming up.

37:13.870 --> 37:37.595
[SPEAKER_11]: but I think I got everything in my gaming week oh one other thing I should throw out there on the Wii U this week and I'm spoiling the news a little bit but it's my own story Earthbound was out on the Wii U this week I played a bit of that on virtual console it's nice to revisit that game after a very long time I played it on emulators once like years ago but to be able to like play it again on the TV and on the little gamepad is is a nice experience it's

37:38.195 --> 37:40.056
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a great, great RPG.

37:40.136 --> 37:41.116
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my all-time favorites.

37:41.176 --> 37:41.717
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is.

37:41.797 --> 37:52.421
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I know Bobby's been razzing me a little bit about the whole Super Metroid versus EarthBound thing, but I'm always kind of like, but EarthBound really is like a really good game, and I don't find EarthBound to be overrated.

37:52.461 --> 37:55.523
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not my favorite game, but it's probably in my top five.

37:55.603 --> 37:56.683
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I love EarthBound.

37:56.723 --> 37:57.123
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

37:57.684 --> 37:57.824
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

37:58.544 --> 37:59.644
[SPEAKER_11]: Glad to be playing that again.

38:00.165 --> 38:02.005
[SPEAKER_11]: And glad to hear they didn't really change a lot.

38:02.105 --> 38:04.266
[SPEAKER_11]: The changes they made, very minor stuff.

38:04.606 --> 38:08.428
[SPEAKER_11]: They made one dialogue change, and I don't even think it was that big a deal.

38:08.528 --> 38:14.810
[SPEAKER_11]: And they changed some of the graphic effects to tone down the amazing seizure displays that some of the side effects have.

38:14.830 --> 38:15.591
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean the embryos?

38:16.071 --> 38:16.271
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm?

38:16.511 --> 38:17.291
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean the embryos?

38:17.451 --> 38:18.111
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right?

38:19.312 --> 38:21.113
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, good times.

38:22.793 --> 38:24.895
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so that's it for our gaming weeks.

38:25.616 --> 38:32.501
[SPEAKER_11]: Quick housekeeping, twitter.com slash orange, excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR or facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to follow us.

38:33.242 --> 38:38.566
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, do support the other shows we have at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

38:39.206 --> 38:42.589
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not, and this is going to be news to you guys, so sorry to spring this on you mid-show.

38:42.649 --> 38:46.932
[SPEAKER_11]: We will not be here in two weeks because I'm going to be at that convention in San Francisco.

38:46.992 --> 38:47.793
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be back in time.

38:48.353 --> 38:50.335
[SPEAKER_11]: So, because Sunday's the last day, so.

38:50.695 --> 38:50.995
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

38:51.236 --> 38:51.496
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

38:51.596 --> 38:52.036
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about it.

38:53.658 --> 38:54.519
[SPEAKER_11]: No show in two weeks.

38:54.899 --> 38:55.359
[SPEAKER_11]: Surprise.

38:56.280 --> 39:08.731
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe I don't keep that flexible because maybe I'll be back early enough or we can do something a little later or something, but I just... I totally want to take over the stream and do a fuck-off show.

39:08.812 --> 39:10.073
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, do whatever you want.

39:10.193 --> 39:11.514
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Jamie Rants.

39:11.634 --> 39:12.675
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do a live stream.

39:12.855 --> 39:14.957
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki can play Borderlands whenever.

39:15.177 --> 39:15.978
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not playing Borderlands.

39:16.118 --> 39:16.579
[SPEAKER_11]: GameBooey

39:42.822 --> 39:45.363
[SPEAKER_11]: Game Bar, and more.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.063
[SPEAKER_11]: Special surprise guest, hopefully.

39:47.924 --> 39:57.687
[SPEAKER_11]: All talking about podcasting and kind of our own shows and trying to enable other people to do their own shows and enable more broadcasters.

39:58.267 --> 40:04.169
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a GLBT-focused convention, obviously, but we're really about everybody having a voice.

40:04.509 --> 40:04.849
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

40:07.170 --> 40:10.792
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get into some news.

40:11.032 --> 40:11.292
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

40:11.892 --> 40:12.132
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

40:12.752 --> 40:13.433
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon Rumble.

40:14.753 --> 40:23.277
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually kind of surprised that this is coming out still digitally, but Pokemon Rumble was a game that came out in Japan, I think earlier last year, maybe this year.

40:25.538 --> 40:30.101
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a digital download for the Wii U, and what makes it kind of unique is it...

40:31.753 --> 40:38.118
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of going the Skylanders route where you have these physical figurines that you buy for a certain amount of money.

40:39.159 --> 40:51.007
[SPEAKER_12]: And you, I think you put them on, I don't know if it's, I want to say it was the near field communication part of the Wii U tablet or the game pad or whatever.

40:51.568 --> 40:52.689
[SPEAKER_12]: And it interacted with that.

40:53.229 --> 40:56.451
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is coming out over here in North America, August 29th.

40:58.592 --> 41:19.809
[SPEAKER_12]: 18 figurines however they are sold exclusively at Evil G so if you watch your Pokemon you know Nintendo has still made this blood pack with Evil G to do that the game I guess is 18 bucks in the eShop each figurine is going to be $4 I don't know

41:22.825 --> 41:23.105
[SPEAKER_12]: Neat.

41:24.746 --> 41:26.087
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, why not?

41:27.388 --> 41:32.351
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for the fact that it's a GameStop exclusive, but something to hold us over until X and Y, right?

41:32.471 --> 41:35.413
[SPEAKER_12]: Europe is also going to be getting the game August 15th.

41:35.974 --> 41:40.516
[SPEAKER_12]: No words on how they're going to, if that's going to be done through GameStop in Europe as well.

41:40.837 --> 41:41.177
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

41:43.016 --> 41:43.717
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of lame.

41:43.797 --> 41:44.097
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

41:44.117 --> 41:52.223
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't understand why they're making... I mean, I understand they're a big company, but why exclusive through GameStop to do this stuff?

41:53.604 --> 41:54.865
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why they would do that.

41:54.885 --> 41:59.108
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, because honestly, I think everybody could sell those stupid figurines.

41:59.148 --> 42:00.829
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell, they put out the game as like a disc.

42:01.010 --> 42:02.591
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm surprised they didn't do that in the first place.

42:02.611 --> 42:03.611
[SPEAKER_12]: $20 game, you know?

42:06.208 --> 42:06.889
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Luigi U's on disc, right?

42:06.909 --> 42:07.169
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be.

42:29.987 --> 42:37.331
[SPEAKER_11]: which sadly makes sense because Nintendo's trying to push people to the Wii U and there are people crazy enough to buy a Wii U to play EarthBound.

42:37.491 --> 42:38.491
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't play it at my house.

42:39.292 --> 42:41.633
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially considering how much those cartridges go for on eBay.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.754
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I won't tell you how cheap we got ours.

42:44.354 --> 42:46.275
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you might have got lucky too.

42:46.295 --> 42:48.656
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you find it at a... It was a long time ago.

42:48.836 --> 42:49.056
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

42:49.857 --> 42:51.978
[SPEAKER_07]: Before the value... Probably when we had the video game store.

42:52.538 --> 42:52.698
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

42:54.051 --> 42:56.414
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, this is out.

42:56.454 --> 42:58.457
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a special Nintendo Direct to go with it.

42:58.878 --> 43:05.407
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people taking surprise at the increased price because the game is $9.99 on the Wii U eShop.

43:05.447 --> 43:08.491
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not the normal, I'm using my quotey fingers, price of $7.99.

43:09.993 --> 43:14.319
[SPEAKER_11]: But to be honest, this isn't the first time we've seen a game priced higher than the bar.

43:15.461 --> 43:23.672
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe Mario 2 loss levels, or just Super Mario 2, the Japanese version, was a dollar more than most NES games.

43:23.692 --> 43:26.916
[SPEAKER_11]: Because on the Wii, they did this whole week of...

43:27.717 --> 43:28.958
[SPEAKER_11]: and import releases.

43:29.178 --> 43:32.181
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, Mario 2 is the big flagship of those, the original one.

43:32.602 --> 43:33.763
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was a dollar more.

43:34.143 --> 43:40.669
[SPEAKER_11]: The Final Fantasy games, I think, at least the Super Nintendo ones that they put out on Virtual Console, those were a dollar or maybe even two dollars more.

43:40.689 --> 43:41.690
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they were a dollar more.

43:41.710 --> 43:42.991
[SPEAKER_12]: Squeenix tax.

43:43.291 --> 43:43.992
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, basically.

43:44.052 --> 43:46.034
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now this is, you know, Nintendo tax.

43:46.954 --> 43:47.495
[SPEAKER_11]: Both.

43:48.276 --> 43:50.518
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, so why are they charging the increased price?

43:50.558 --> 43:51.959
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they can, honestly.

43:52.459 --> 43:52.720
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

43:55.000 --> 43:57.121
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotta make up that GameStop exclusive money somewhere.

43:57.481 --> 43:58.221
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess so.

43:58.421 --> 44:18.029
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's not like $9.99 is a ripoff, but they are talking about that there's an enhanced value about the Earthbound Strategy Guide, which is out there, and it's enhanced for the Wii U gamepad, and you can actually view it on Nintendo's Earthbound site, which, you know, you press the little home button, go into the browser, and you can open up on the site.

44:18.569 --> 44:19.390
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna be honest...

44:20.470 --> 44:25.352
[SPEAKER_11]: I find that feature, and I'm using my quotey fingers, I find that feature to be a little bit disingenuous.

44:25.712 --> 44:31.694
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that's really a feature because you're just advertising a website, basically.

44:32.195 --> 44:39.938
[SPEAKER_11]: And to be honest, I could go, I could open up my internet browser and go to GameFacts.com and pull up almost anything that's on Virtual Console.

44:40.198 --> 44:40.858
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can do that.

44:41.238 --> 44:47.702
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool that Nintendo, you know, did the optimized, you know, and scanned it in and made that or whatever.

44:47.822 --> 44:51.925
[SPEAKER_11]: But you technically don't have to own Earthbound to see that.

44:51.945 --> 44:52.866
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

44:52.886 --> 44:55.848
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not really value for buying the game.

44:56.368 --> 45:02.172
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're going to tell me that the $2 was for that, I'm going to tell you that's a crock of shit.

45:02.792 --> 45:10.938
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that would be like me saying, oh, well, with every copy of Donkey Kong sold on the virtual console, you get a free vognetwork.com.

45:11.818 --> 45:36.212
[SPEAKER_11]: check it out it's not it doesn't quite work for me I mean cool yay it would be neat if Nintendo would do more manuals and stuff but you know what would be even better is if instead of having to press the home button having to press the internet browser button having to enter in earthbound.nintendo.com having to wait for the thing to load you know what would be even better than that

45:36.952 --> 45:37.653
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

45:52.913 --> 45:54.994
[SPEAKER_11]: Get online and speed some things up a little bit.

45:56.475 --> 45:58.055
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess this is a baby step.

45:58.156 --> 46:04.358
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you know with your copy of Balloon Flight that you can actually get a free copy of Pornhub?

46:05.439 --> 46:05.919
[SPEAKER_12]: Free porn.

46:06.499 --> 46:08.080
[SPEAKER_12]: With a Nintendo title.

46:08.120 --> 46:09.081
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's ridiculous.

46:10.001 --> 46:11.222
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's optimized.

46:12.042 --> 46:18.725
[SPEAKER_11]: ShadowNextGen in chat at live.vognetwork.com says the guide from Nintendo would most likely be better than what you will find on GameFAQs.

46:18.745 --> 46:19.525
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

46:19.806 --> 46:19.946
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

46:21.059 --> 46:23.262
[SPEAKER_11]: I... Graphically, yes.

46:23.882 --> 46:26.485
[SPEAKER_11]: For the retro-minded in you, yes.

46:26.786 --> 46:31.971
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, again, for the whole, like, tickling your retro tastes or whatever, yes.

46:32.292 --> 46:34.654
[SPEAKER_11]: But GameFAQs will honestly be faster.

46:34.755 --> 46:36.536
[SPEAKER_11]: That site was slow as hell when I was playing with it.

46:36.557 --> 46:40.601
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably outsourced anyway, so you're probably gonna get... It's probably gonna be a Prima guide or something.

46:42.103 --> 46:42.283
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

46:43.248 --> 46:43.888
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, it wasn't.

46:44.308 --> 46:50.410
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, this was years ago, but every copy of Earthbound, when you bought it, it came in that bigger box.

46:50.530 --> 46:56.091
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe, I could be wrong, I believe it was a whole thing tied in to push Nintendo Power subscriptions.

46:56.591 --> 46:59.392
[SPEAKER_11]: Because remember how Nintendo Power would do those guides?

46:59.792 --> 47:01.653
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one for Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy.

47:01.673 --> 47:02.813
[SPEAKER_11]: Mario Paint.

47:02.833 --> 47:07.274
[SPEAKER_11]: I could be wrong, but I thought Earthbound was technically one of those guides.

47:07.794 --> 47:10.995
[SPEAKER_11]: And that there were things in there to try to get you to get a Nintendo Power subscription.

47:12.421 --> 47:13.543
[SPEAKER_12]: I had the Mario Paint one.

47:13.583 --> 47:14.825
[SPEAKER_12]: That was freaking sweet.

47:14.905 --> 47:16.647
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm having to think back almost 20 years here.

47:17.108 --> 47:17.288
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

47:20.031 --> 47:24.432
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, all sorts of pixel art in there for doing animated Yoshis and all sorts of fun stuff.

47:25.873 --> 47:28.854
[SPEAKER_11]: Alpha Cananogram says, The online US guide sucks.

47:28.914 --> 47:33.495
[SPEAKER_11]: The Nintendo Europe site has the PDF to download, and you put it on your iPad.

47:33.996 --> 47:36.056
[SPEAKER_11]: That's honestly how I've been doing a lot of playthroughs.

47:36.096 --> 47:40.338
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just Nintendo, but even 360 and PlayStation 3 as well.

47:40.418 --> 47:42.318
[SPEAKER_11]: I pull up the thing on my iPad.

47:43.099 --> 47:43.659
[SPEAKER_11]: Works great.

47:44.899 --> 47:49.885
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and BlackWolf says, it was a Nintendo guide, not a Prima guide.

47:50.245 --> 47:51.627
[SPEAKER_11]: Could have still been outsourced, though.

47:51.647 --> 47:55.310
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't necessarily, I mean, it could have, it didn't necessarily have to come in internally from Nintendo.

47:55.330 --> 47:56.612
[SPEAKER_11]: It could have, but, you know.

47:58.305 --> 48:00.366
[SPEAKER_11]: But they had the hotline, didn't they?

48:01.387 --> 48:03.568
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they still did at that time, yeah.

48:03.648 --> 48:05.589
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, the game counselors, absolutely.

48:06.990 --> 48:07.250
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

48:09.391 --> 48:16.155
[SPEAKER_11]: To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Thunder.

48:17.155 --> 48:18.096
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on, DarkSakura.

48:19.133 --> 48:19.533
[SPEAKER_07]: Venture

48:39.342 --> 48:41.163
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, you brought that up on the show before.

48:41.443 --> 48:43.063
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've done Venture as a classic.

48:43.303 --> 48:44.104
[SPEAKER_07]: If I haven't, I should.

48:44.284 --> 48:44.724
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you have.

48:45.504 --> 48:53.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, speaking of classic games, and this is, everybody has been messaging me this to show Dan, and Dan knows.

48:53.687 --> 48:54.027
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.

48:54.047 --> 48:54.807
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course Dan knows.

48:54.967 --> 48:56.228
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course Dan knows.

48:56.348 --> 48:58.148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice that people think of you, though.

48:58.368 --> 48:59.489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everybody.

48:59.569 --> 49:05.491
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there, keep in mind, Dan used to run a site called Neo Striders Strider Zone.

49:06.931 --> 49:11.794
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was one of two Strider sites that existed back in the days when people had websites on AOL.

49:12.214 --> 49:14.976
[SPEAKER_12]: He was probably sitting there all of a sudden the hair on his arm went up.

49:14.996 --> 49:16.476
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, Strider news has been announced.

49:16.496 --> 49:26.162
[SPEAKER_07]: He turned red in the face and like all of a sudden weird signals came from his head where he started accepting the vibe of Strider as it flowed.

49:26.302 --> 49:26.642
[SPEAKER_11]: Did he cry?

49:26.682 --> 49:27.422
[SPEAKER_11]: Was there a little shaking?

49:27.462 --> 49:28.043
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he peed a little.

49:28.323 --> 49:28.683
Deep breath.

49:30.376 --> 49:32.837
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I'm glad that he's not listening right now.

49:32.977 --> 49:34.658
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I love you, Dan.

49:34.738 --> 49:36.379
[SPEAKER_11]: What other embarrassing Dan stories do you want to tell?

49:37.200 --> 49:37.740
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you, mean it.

49:37.860 --> 49:41.642
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I did say that I was going to clone his liver and sell multiple copies on eBay.

49:41.782 --> 49:45.564
[SPEAKER_07]: Because livers are worth the money, man.

49:47.405 --> 49:49.626
[SPEAKER_07]: I told him if he ever pissed me off, I'd punch him until he peed blood.

49:51.465 --> 49:52.886
[SPEAKER_12]: You make that thread of a lot of people, though.

49:53.066 --> 49:53.507
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.

49:53.527 --> 49:55.228
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't just throw that around willy-nilly.

49:55.789 --> 49:57.470
[SPEAKER_07]: I only do that to people I care about.

49:58.271 --> 49:58.891
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, by the way.

50:00.333 --> 50:02.294
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so yeah, I mentioned Strider.

50:02.475 --> 50:03.175
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Strider.

50:03.435 --> 50:11.602
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a version of Strider which is supposed to be a series reboot, from what I understand, like a redoing of the first game.

50:12.103 --> 50:15.105
[SPEAKER_07]: From what we could see of the trailer, it looked like the whole first level.

50:15.506 --> 50:18.488
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's being done by Double Helix, who is also working on Killer Instinct, so...

50:19.369 --> 50:23.732
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, this looks like it would be a lot better than that Killer Instinct thing, so I have some high hopes.

50:25.173 --> 50:31.997
[SPEAKER_07]: Watching the gameplay, it was really, really cool.

50:32.858 --> 50:37.601
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't so much walk as Dash everywhere he goes, he runs with purpose.

50:38.567 --> 50:40.409
[SPEAKER_07]: And now keep in mind, I loved Strider 2.

50:40.890 --> 50:42.111
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved the updated thing.

50:42.432 --> 50:46.416
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved every appearance of Strider, hear you, in Marvel vs. Capcom.

50:47.358 --> 50:50.301
[SPEAKER_07]: The various Marvel vs. Capcoms when he was playable.

50:51.563 --> 50:57.610
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of my favorite characters of all time, thanks to Dan making me sit down and said, any person I marry is going to beat Strider.

50:59.372 --> 51:04.074
[SPEAKER_07]: on Genesis, which I have, and finally beaten on arcade and beaten PlayStation version, blah, blah, blah, blah.

51:04.915 --> 51:07.276
[SPEAKER_07]: That last fight with the stupid master is a bitch.

51:08.277 --> 51:09.257
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pain in the ass.

51:09.717 --> 51:17.061
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, so yeah, we both have a lot of happy going on in our house because of Strider.

51:17.241 --> 51:19.002
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you even love Strider on the NES?

51:20.103 --> 51:21.804
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to tell you about Strider on the NES.

51:23.104 --> 51:24.105
[SPEAKER_07]: It's based off the manga.

51:25.558 --> 51:27.320
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is not the arcade game.

51:27.560 --> 51:30.723
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got this one jump that's like freaking impossible.

51:31.204 --> 51:34.487
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we own the game and I think Dan kind of likes it.

51:34.547 --> 51:35.868
[SPEAKER_11]: The infamous triangle jump.

51:36.089 --> 51:37.010
[SPEAKER_07]: The triangle jump, yes.

51:37.630 --> 51:39.932
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like the story in the game.

51:40.133 --> 51:40.953
[SPEAKER_07]: I've read the manga.

51:42.195 --> 51:43.156
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like playing it.

51:44.057 --> 51:49.242
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would much rather play the original Strider any day.

51:50.009 --> 51:52.871
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved Strider on the NES because I didn't have a Genesis.

51:52.911 --> 51:54.392
[SPEAKER_11]: We weren't really a Sega household.

51:54.432 --> 51:55.313
[SPEAKER_11]: We were all Nintendo.

51:55.373 --> 51:57.754
[SPEAKER_11]: So I played Strider on the NES.

51:57.774 --> 51:58.435
[SPEAKER_11]: I really liked it.

51:58.575 --> 52:03.718
[SPEAKER_11]: And hearing that this new game is kind of Metroidvania-ish made me think of the NES version.

52:03.758 --> 52:06.280
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that the NES was really Metroidvania, but it had the different stages.

52:07.341 --> 52:14.826
[SPEAKER_11]: The Nintendo Strider, I'm almost positive, was the same engine that DuckTales used because they were very similar where you would select a stage.

52:15.006 --> 52:16.587
[SPEAKER_11]: You would go to the various areas.

52:16.907 --> 52:17.888
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Capcom.

52:17.928 --> 52:18.469
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean it was...

52:19.589 --> 52:20.771
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

52:34.765 --> 52:59.410
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Strider in the arcade a couple of times and it wasn't really my thing and I didn't play it on Nintendo but like I said Dan sat me down and said any woman I marry is going to play Strider so I've beaten Ghosts and Goblins 2 which made me want to cry tears of blood but Strider at least is a fun game and you know he actually told me a little bit of trivia about that too is that it was going to be a regular cartridge but because they wanted to put the Amazon level in it

52:59.730 --> 53:03.611
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually upped the memory in it so they can include the Amazon level and have the music and everything.

53:03.771 --> 53:03.991
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

53:04.351 --> 53:04.531
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

53:05.371 --> 53:11.393
[SPEAKER_11]: So... So this news fills a certain hole in your heart that not even Moondiver could fill, right?

53:12.213 --> 53:12.573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

53:12.593 --> 53:14.693
[SPEAKER_07]: Moondiver was a good game.

53:14.813 --> 53:20.755
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a spiritual successor in the series, but we need to have Strider.

53:21.655 --> 53:22.135
[SPEAKER_07]: No one...

53:22.675 --> 53:37.092
[SPEAKER_07]: and what I'm kind of hoping is that with this we get some of the elements from Strider 2 like we see Hien you know because I actually I really like to play through the game with Hien that was really fun the guy who had two ciphers it was really cool but um

53:38.126 --> 53:39.027
[SPEAKER_07]: I have high hopes for this.

53:39.387 --> 53:40.167
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty.

53:40.267 --> 53:42.068
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it plays solidly.

53:43.069 --> 53:45.070
[SPEAKER_07]: The backgrounds were amazing.

53:45.110 --> 53:46.090
[SPEAKER_07]: The music was amazing.

53:46.110 --> 53:49.352
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was the same first level that I heard.

53:49.452 --> 53:51.994
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will keep my fingers crossed.

53:52.014 --> 54:00.698
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people have been frowning a little bit hearing who's developing this because, you know, the new Killer Instinct game, which I don't know.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.000
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's hard to judge a game that's not even out.

54:03.100 --> 54:03.420
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

54:04.080 --> 54:28.224
[SPEAKER_11]: but Silent Hill Homecoming has a lot of people kind of nervous but you know I don't know if it's we really have to wait till the game's out I mean WayForward does a lot of great retro updates now dude they made Ping Pals if I remember right so that game was literally the worst handheld game in history so if you know this that company can do better after their first couple attempts I'm willing to give these guys a chance

54:29.421 --> 54:57.346
[SPEAKER_07]: and like I said I looked at the trailer and it really would be hard to screw up Strider unless there were major timing and physics issues other than that it really looked very solid and all they have to do is take the timing physics from the original and they would know exactly how to do it and like I said I've played other versions of Strider we actually have the PC Engine version which we can't play because we don't have the card for it, the arcade card but

54:58.246 --> 55:01.188
[SPEAKER_07]: That one even... I don't think it would be too hard.

55:01.228 --> 55:02.248
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't think it would be too hard.

55:02.268 --> 55:06.110
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd have to really screw up, like I said, timing and physics to ruin the game.

55:07.010 --> 55:09.532
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, maybe really shitty voice acting.

55:10.132 --> 55:10.352
[SPEAKER_07]: Which...

55:11.289 --> 55:16.431
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't get... Even the first game actually had pretty... The original had pretty decent voice acting in it.

55:16.871 --> 55:20.332
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all in whatever the native language of whoever the character was.

55:20.832 --> 55:22.053
[SPEAKER_07]: But it has the best line in it.

55:22.873 --> 55:23.513
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, gotcha.

55:24.474 --> 55:24.994
[SPEAKER_07]: The one guy.

55:25.154 --> 55:27.235
[SPEAKER_12]: And the new one's like, I'm Strider!

55:27.315 --> 55:29.115
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna hit you with my sword!

55:29.135 --> 55:31.296
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, hi, I hear you!

55:32.796 --> 55:33.217
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

55:34.897 --> 55:37.078
[SPEAKER_07]: They better give him the uber-bishy voice, you know?

55:39.012 --> 55:41.514
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised they waited to announce this for Comic Con.

55:41.534 --> 55:44.156
[SPEAKER_11]: That they didn't bring this out at E3.

55:44.196 --> 55:45.637
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, maybe it just wasn't ready.

55:45.917 --> 55:49.740
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of the games that the fans have been dying to get a new game of.

55:50.600 --> 55:55.424
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry Mega Man, you guys fucking suck.

55:55.664 --> 55:57.545
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy the Game Boy games on 3DS.

55:57.565 --> 55:59.446
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mega Man thing I think is Spite now.

56:01.648 --> 56:07.112
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm actually a little bit more excited about Strider than I am about a Mega Man game, so.

56:07.755 --> 56:17.260
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a Mega Man project's in the works, but I think with this Strider news and so forth and Mega Man and Smash, I think there'll be something next year.

56:17.380 --> 56:19.482
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, easy to say, right?

56:20.042 --> 56:22.163
[SPEAKER_11]: Any Strider analyst can say that.

56:23.063 --> 56:24.164
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's move on.

56:24.204 --> 56:24.484
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

56:24.504 --> 56:29.087
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be really awesome as if they do a new Mega Man unit.

56:29.107 --> 56:31.948
[SPEAKER_12]: It's done by, was it WayForward, actually?

56:32.469 --> 56:33.569
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, you know.

56:33.629 --> 56:35.110
[SPEAKER_07]: There were comments to that in the chat room, too.

56:36.805 --> 56:38.275
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.

56:39.403 --> 56:39.846
[SPEAKER_12]: They can't do it.

56:40.146 --> 56:41.807
[SPEAKER_12]: If the DuckTales thing goes well, you never know.

56:42.988 --> 56:43.569
[SPEAKER_12]: That looks cool.

56:44.109 --> 56:49.093
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so NCAA, there was a bit of drama with that, considering that the game just came out.

56:50.394 --> 56:54.197
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, NCAA is not renewing its contract with EA.

56:55.338 --> 56:59.262
[SPEAKER_12]: This will be, I guess, the last year that it'll be called NCAA Football 14.

57:00.262 --> 57:05.607
[SPEAKER_12]: However, and I know they have a lawsuit against them, and this is from 2008, basically saying that...

57:10.130 --> 57:18.474
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say it was because they've never licensed the use of current student athlete names, images, or likenesses.

57:19.074 --> 57:32.140
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the whole reason that they're not renewing their contract with them is they're trying to distance themselves from EA because EA is kind of going around them and putting these students in the game.

57:33.961 --> 57:37.382
[SPEAKER_12]: and I guess EA is still going to be making college football games.

57:37.402 --> 57:43.864
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll just probably be called EA Sports College Football 15 next year or something like that.

57:45.645 --> 57:59.990
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, you know, they're just saying that once again, even like some attorneys that are dealing with the whole lawsuit are saying, yeah, it's basically an announcement makes plain that NCAA is attempting to mitigate the damages of

58:01.110 --> 58:15.818
[SPEAKER_12]: They say that our suit illustrates the cabal between NCAA and EA has exploited student athletes for years using their images in video games without compensation.

58:15.958 --> 58:16.719
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that sounds like EA.

58:17.319 --> 58:29.267
[SPEAKER_12]: While we are heartened that they've stopped the practice, we believe that they owe students or student-athletes a great deal more than implied promise to stop stealing their images.

58:29.687 --> 58:30.848
[SPEAKER_12]: So how's that going to work next year?

58:30.888 --> 58:34.270
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they actually going to stop using the student images?

58:34.310 --> 58:38.733
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just going to be like generic people on a team type thing?

58:38.953 --> 58:41.235
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going like EA Sports Tech Mobile here?

58:41.375 --> 58:43.116
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, how's that going to work?

58:43.556 --> 58:44.237
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know.

58:46.485 --> 58:46.845
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

58:48.246 --> 58:52.708
[SPEAKER_12]: And I even read in chat or something that they were saying that next year is going to be all next-gen anyways.

58:53.308 --> 58:54.989
[SPEAKER_12]: No current-gen version of the game.

58:56.230 --> 58:58.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Could be a chance to kind of reboot, reinvent things a little bit.

58:58.991 --> 59:02.332
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be interesting to see if 2K comes back with a college football game.

59:03.513 --> 59:10.356
[SPEAKER_12]: The last one, remember how they tried to do that whole American football or I forget what their one.

59:10.516 --> 59:14.518
[SPEAKER_12]: Had this weird lineup of people in there and stuff and fake teams and stuff.

59:15.199 --> 59:19.866
[SPEAKER_12]: and that didn't work out too well but it'd be kind of neat to see 2K come back and do you know

59:20.759 --> 59:24.040
[SPEAKER_11]: How important is it to have the actual people in the game?

59:24.360 --> 59:28.962
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't play a whole lot of sports games, but it's never really mattered to me for the games I've played.

59:28.982 --> 59:33.184
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but for sports games, you want to play as your favorite players and stuff.

59:34.024 --> 59:38.726
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I realize the EA NCAA games didn't actually have the player.

59:38.806 --> 59:41.327
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, they were all there except in name.

59:41.387 --> 59:43.148
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's what it was, right?

59:43.428 --> 59:45.609
[SPEAKER_11]: Their stats were what you would expect to see.

59:45.689 --> 59:48.570
[SPEAKER_11]: Their looks were what you would expect to see with subtle changes.

59:49.091 --> 59:49.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the names weren't there.

59:50.191 --> 01:00:02.937
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it's just, they want, you know, they, just like, you know, if you were playing an NBA game, you'd want to have, you know, they pay those players to use their likenesses and stuff in the game.

01:00:03.397 --> 01:00:06.259
[SPEAKER_12]: So the thing is, why aren't they paying these college students?

01:00:06.359 --> 01:00:07.719
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they think they can get away with it.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.180
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, what's a college student going to do?

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:09.901
[SPEAKER_12]: Try to sue me?

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:10.941
[SPEAKER_12]: Ha, you're broke.

01:00:11.261 --> 01:00:11.982
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, seriously.

01:00:13.002 --> 01:00:14.823
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they can't, they can't profit.

01:00:15.203 --> 01:00:17.685
[SPEAKER_12]: It's NCAA regulations that they can't do that.

01:00:17.785 --> 01:00:20.486
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, NCAA is saying that they never license that stuff to them.

01:00:20.506 --> 01:00:25.870
[SPEAKER_12]: They're basically saying, oh, well, we didn't do this, but they're still getting this stuff in the game anyway.

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:27.891
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Bobby in chat wants to clarify.

01:00:28.111 --> 01:00:31.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby Blackwolf says, they only lost the NCAA name, nothing else.

01:00:31.793 --> 01:00:34.175
[SPEAKER_11]: The colleges and bowls and stadiums and stuff are still EA.

01:00:34.235 --> 01:00:37.176
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing they lost is the NCAA name and the NCAA logo.

01:00:37.196 --> 01:00:37.517
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

01:00:38.317 --> 01:00:39.458
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then that won't affect anything.

01:00:40.444 --> 01:00:40.964
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't think?

01:00:41.324 --> 01:00:41.685
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think.

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:43.366
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it'll be a big deal either.

01:00:43.626 --> 01:00:45.447
[SPEAKER_11]: I think at the end of the day, a good game is a good game.

01:00:46.027 --> 01:00:47.608
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I love Tecmo Bowl.

01:00:47.648 --> 01:00:48.969
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like my favorite football game.

01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:50.890
[SPEAKER_11]: And it didn't really have any of that.

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:53.371
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, anyhow.

01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:58.322
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on.

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:01.645
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of gaming things being shown at Comic-Con.

01:01:01.685 --> 01:01:18.099
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I know gaming kind of comes up every year at Comic-Con, but it definitely seems like there's more of it this year than we usually see, and that probably has something to do with the fact that we have new consoles coming this year, so obviously the companies want to push that to the potential buying audience, of which a lot of them are at Comic-Con right now, although I'm not there.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:19.680
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

01:01:20.601 --> 01:01:22.602
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony is at Comic Con with the PlayStation 4.

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:28.985
[SPEAKER_11]: They have Knack and Drive Club out there open for play, letting the public experience PlayStation 4.

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:32.027
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would be a safe bet to say those games will show up.

01:01:32.167 --> 01:01:35.788
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything you're hearing here, these games will get in a truck and move to PAX in a couple weeks.

01:01:35.948 --> 01:01:36.449
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:42.291
[SPEAKER_11]: Octodad, I guess, is part of PlayStation 4 as well.

01:01:42.692 --> 01:01:45.873
[SPEAKER_11]: Gran Turismo 6 is also there, even though technically that's not next-gen.

01:01:45.893 --> 01:01:46.393
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still there.

01:01:46.413 --> 01:01:47.454
[SPEAKER_11]: It still looks nice.

01:01:47.634 --> 01:01:54.695
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Microsoft has Rise with the Y, Rise, and Killer Instinct out there on the floor.

01:01:54.736 --> 01:01:56.576
[SPEAKER_11]: Killer Instinct drawing pretty good crowds.

01:01:56.636 --> 01:01:57.996
[SPEAKER_11]: It's apparently Rise is too.

01:01:59.136 --> 01:02:07.658
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently other games being shown out there, Dead Rising 3, Assassin's Creed 4, and Watch Dogs all there at Comic-Con.

01:02:07.678 --> 01:02:08.458
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just a taste.

01:02:08.498 --> 01:02:11.619
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just some of the stuff that involves next-gen and the big companies.

01:02:12.059 --> 01:02:15.980
[SPEAKER_11]: So is there any comics to be found at Comic-Con out of curiosity?

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:17.681
[SPEAKER_07]: Marvel's got a whole big thing.

01:02:18.221 --> 01:02:18.942
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know.

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.284
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, they actually did announce the next Avengers movie.

01:02:21.824 --> 01:02:22.624
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but that's a movie.

01:02:22.645 --> 01:02:23.245
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a comic.

01:02:23.505 --> 01:02:24.886
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it's still Marvel.

01:02:25.066 --> 01:02:27.168
[SPEAKER_07]: And why are they fucking going with Age of Ultron?

01:02:27.708 --> 01:02:27.848
[SPEAKER_07]: Ugh!

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:28.549
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:29.249
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a fan?

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:30.830
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a fan of Ultron.

01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:32.571
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're doing the same thing in the comics.

01:02:33.332 --> 01:02:34.393
[SPEAKER_07]: They tease Thanos.

01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:44.915
[SPEAKER_11]: So here I go talking about movies on the Video Game Podcast, but I went to go see This is the End last night, which was funny.

01:02:45.155 --> 01:02:47.376
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of those movies that was so stupid.

01:02:48.417 --> 01:02:53.960
[SPEAKER_11]: It's seriously stupid, but to the point where it's actually really funny.

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.202
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so stupid you can't help but laugh, like a lot of stoner comedies are.

01:02:57.222 --> 01:02:57.842
[SPEAKER_11]: It was great.

01:02:58.122 --> 01:02:59.143
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I had a good time.

01:02:59.183 --> 01:02:59.523
[SPEAKER_11]: It was good.

01:02:59.823 --> 01:03:02.505
[SPEAKER_11]: But I got home, and the first news that greets me when I get home,

01:03:03.385 --> 01:03:07.587
[SPEAKER_11]: The Superman sequel will have Batman in it.

01:03:08.508 --> 01:03:13.470
[SPEAKER_11]: They're doing the Superman versus Batman thing that was in one of the... I'm just like, stop.

01:03:13.491 --> 01:03:13.671
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

01:03:14.111 --> 01:03:14.831
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:23.836
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know this is a whole to build up to the Justice League movie that they have to do because Marvel's got the Avengers, so now DC's got to do this.

01:03:24.136 --> 01:03:24.977
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like, no.

01:03:25.837 --> 01:03:26.057
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

01:03:26.498 --> 01:03:32.281
[SPEAKER_11]: You do not get to do a Justice League movie until you fucking do a Wonder Woman movie.

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:59.566
[SPEAKER_11]: you don't get to debut her no she needs her own movie and it needs to be good because if it sucks you don't get to do a Justice League movie and I don't I god the whole idea of Batman and Superman is just I don't I don't like that I don't know like I get that it's based on a comic and it was a real thing and everything but I don't know maybe there's just that part of me that holds out hope for a fourth bail Batman movie which I realize they probably couldn't do because of the story and everything but damn it there's always a way

01:04:01.107 --> 01:04:16.322
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to see a sequel to Suburban Commando but instead of having Hulk Hogan in the movie it'll be Christian Bale Batman and he'll be like going around the neighborhood driving a car just a regular car not the Batmobile just like growling at people you know that'd be fun maybe babysitting some kids

01:04:19.794 --> 01:04:25.395
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some Marvel vs. DC chat going on in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com And all the Marvel people are right.

01:04:26.176 --> 01:04:29.617
[SPEAKER_11]: Brad from PodCulture says, You should ask if any good comics are there.

01:04:29.677 --> 01:04:30.497
[SPEAKER_11]: Who reads Marvel?

01:04:31.478 --> 01:04:32.238
[SPEAKER_07]: People with taste.

01:04:33.098 --> 01:04:33.478
[SPEAKER_11]: Snap.

01:04:34.219 --> 01:04:36.920
[SPEAKER_11]: Slidekick says, I've always preferred Marvel for superheroes.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.300
[SPEAKER_11]: People, please.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.901
[SPEAKER_11]: There's good and bad on both sides.

01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:42.461
[SPEAKER_11]: There's good and bad on both sides.

01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:43.642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, check out Rocket Raccoon.

01:04:44.975 --> 01:04:46.215
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about image anyways.

01:05:08.278 --> 01:05:16.680
[SPEAKER_12]: You heard at Comic-Con, I don't know if there was a panel or something with David Coveney and the whole X-Files crew and stuff, but he wants to bring that back.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.021
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, yes, please, that would be fantastic.

01:05:20.101 --> 01:05:26.503
[SPEAKER_12]: I still haven't seen the second movie, which I hear is really dumb, but I would love to have them just bring it back.

01:05:26.543 --> 01:05:28.484
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're both not really fucking doing anything.

01:05:29.344 --> 01:05:32.024
[SPEAKER_12]: Just bring back a whole new series and set it 20 years later and...

01:05:34.065 --> 01:05:37.087
[SPEAKER_12]: Pick up from where it left off.

01:05:37.468 --> 01:05:38.328
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be fantastic.

01:05:42.912 --> 01:05:43.392
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:05:44.813 --> 01:05:46.254
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on with more news.

01:05:46.674 --> 01:05:50.617
[SPEAKER_11]: Classic Game of the Week, still a little bit away, and release dates coming up right after this.

01:05:51.098 --> 01:05:51.538
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.

01:05:53.099 --> 01:05:54.120
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready to friend some butts?

01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.389
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:58.250
[SPEAKER_07]: I explained that to Dan, by the way.

01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:59.850
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, you guys are weird.

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:06.231
[SPEAKER_07]: So Nintendo has trademarked two game names that will really do hint to Seaman.

01:06:08.772 --> 01:06:17.754
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the rights to Mysterious Pet, Legend of the Fish with a Human Face, and Mysterious Partner, Legend of the Fish with a Human Face.

01:06:18.815 --> 01:06:22.636
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was registered in Japan.

01:06:22.796 --> 01:06:23.156
[SPEAKER_07]: It was...

01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:37.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there have been some goings-on with the creator of Seaman, who is Yut Saito, who did work with Nintendo for GameCube content.

01:06:37.582 --> 01:06:42.665
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a pinball game, Odama, and the Guild 101 thing...

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:46.720
[SPEAKER_08]: AeroPorter.

01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:50.703
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could be possible that we may be seeing another Seaman.

01:06:51.263 --> 01:06:55.705
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd have to put out a micro... Well, I guess the microphone's already built into the controller, so who knows?

01:06:56.326 --> 01:07:03.250
[SPEAKER_12]: On both the 3DS and on the... Well, 3DS DS and Wii U. Wii U friend as butt.

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.970
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, not friend as butt.

01:07:05.091 --> 01:07:09.513
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually, it doesn't sound very exciting, but... Sure, why not?

01:07:10.974 --> 01:07:11.134
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

01:07:11.154 --> 01:07:11.214
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

01:07:12.188 --> 01:07:15.271
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that buttfriending should be a thing.

01:07:16.412 --> 01:07:17.213
[SPEAKER_07]: Click to buttfriend.

01:07:17.514 --> 01:07:21.518
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's a lot of people that don't get that joke, and I'm trying to find that original YouTube.

01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:23.960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was a while back.

01:07:24.421 --> 01:07:25.061
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it a Let's Play?

01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:26.002
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a long time ago.

01:07:26.082 --> 01:07:29.045
[SPEAKER_11]: Some dude doing a Let's Play with that game, Seaman.

01:07:29.686 --> 01:07:34.291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it was like Seaman Gameplay or Yeah, Let's Play.

01:07:36.255 --> 01:07:38.197
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming Tigerclaw could probably find it.

01:07:38.377 --> 01:07:39.939
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Tigerclaw, do your job.

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:40.859
[SPEAKER_07]: Find us the link.

01:07:42.241 --> 01:07:42.681
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully.

01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:43.882
[SPEAKER_07]: Friend his butt for us.

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:45.484
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me Tigerclaw that for you.

01:07:47.345 --> 01:07:52.050
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like asking about birthdays and it was like, are we friends?

01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:53.351
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll friend your butt.

01:07:56.614 --> 01:07:57.875
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait, I might have found it.

01:07:58.015 --> 01:07:59.296
[SPEAKER_11]: I might have beat Tigerclaw to this.

01:08:00.698 --> 01:08:01.038
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

01:08:03.632 --> 01:08:05.133
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what month is your birthday in?

01:08:05.153 --> 01:08:06.273
[SPEAKER_11]: October You were born in October?

01:08:06.293 --> 01:08:10.515
[SPEAKER_11]: No it doesn't Let's try that again In what month were you born?

01:08:10.595 --> 01:08:10.855
[SPEAKER_07]: October

01:08:33.922 --> 01:08:35.503
[SPEAKER_02]: You were born in October?

01:08:35.863 --> 01:08:36.164
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:08:37.825 --> 01:08:41.828
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if people would say you're a trick or a treat?

01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.629
[SPEAKER_05]: Treat.

01:08:45.711 --> 01:08:46.852
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the spice?

01:08:48.653 --> 01:08:48.933
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:08:50.955 --> 01:08:53.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can look, but don't touch.

01:08:55.378 --> 01:08:56.319
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to touch you.

01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:00.762
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want?

01:09:01.723 --> 01:09:02.243
[SPEAKER_05]: To touch you.

01:09:04.133 --> 01:09:05.494
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that word.

01:09:06.554 --> 01:09:07.335
[SPEAKER_05]: You just said it.

01:09:07.395 --> 01:09:10.877
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what day is your birthday on?

01:09:12.257 --> 01:09:12.617
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

01:09:14.058 --> 01:09:14.819
[SPEAKER_02]: The second?

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:16.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, bitch.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:21.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Mahatma Gandhi was also born on October 2nd.

01:09:21.642 --> 01:09:25.044
[SPEAKER_11]: This honestly sounds like me talking to Siri.

01:09:25.644 --> 01:09:27.545
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you are as peaceful as he.

01:09:28.566 --> 01:09:33.128
[SPEAKER_02]: I would loathe to be stuck in here with an aggressive human being.

01:09:35.342 --> 01:09:35.802
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.

01:09:38.003 --> 01:09:44.384
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I don't know if our relationship can handle this, you know.

01:09:45.705 --> 01:09:47.685
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, what would the neighbors think?

01:09:48.545 --> 01:09:49.045
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck them.

01:09:51.946 --> 01:09:52.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck them!

01:09:54.287 --> 01:09:55.867
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, why all the noise?

01:09:57.868 --> 01:09:58.328
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mama.

01:10:00.648 --> 01:10:01.008
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

01:10:01.769 --> 01:10:02.769
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mama.

01:10:05.174 --> 01:10:05.514
[SPEAKER_05]: Mama.

01:10:07.616 --> 01:10:09.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, I'm just fine.

01:10:10.097 --> 01:10:10.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

01:10:12.518 --> 01:10:13.779
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm busy.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.400
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't look busy.

01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:22.565
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a Libra.

01:10:23.605 --> 01:10:27.267
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bet you get crushes on people all the time, huh?

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:29.209
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't get any ideas about me.

01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:31.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just be friends.

01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:33.031
[SPEAKER_02]: For now.

01:10:36.348 --> 01:10:37.229
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll friend your butt.

01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:40.672
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you coming on to me?

01:10:40.692 --> 01:10:41.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:10:41.433 --> 01:10:43.475
[SPEAKER_11]: There, there it is.

01:10:43.495 --> 01:10:46.918
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how it floats closer to the... Two minutes and 30 seconds later.

01:10:47.098 --> 01:10:49.821
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, credit to YouTube user EbolaWorld for that.

01:10:49.881 --> 01:10:51.322
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally just stole that there.

01:10:51.342 --> 01:10:54.485
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's where that joke comes from, the whole I'll friend your butt thing, which is great.

01:10:54.865 --> 01:10:58.169
[SPEAKER_11]: So lots of Let's Plays, I'm sure, coming.

01:10:58.429 --> 01:11:01.712
[SPEAKER_11]: If this happens to be true, which I kind of hope it is, that would be great.

01:11:03.046 --> 01:11:07.947
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually did play the game to completion and set our little frogman free.

01:11:09.068 --> 01:11:11.408
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Dan's like, I wonder if he's still there.

01:11:14.309 --> 01:11:15.569
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have our save files intact.

01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:17.790
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:25.872
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming out a lot sooner than any Seaman reboot.

01:11:27.567 --> 01:11:33.493
[SPEAKER_12]: We could definitely use a Seaman reboot this week because all we have is the Smurfs 2.

01:11:33.573 --> 01:11:36.036
[SPEAKER_12]: The official game.

01:11:36.056 --> 01:11:37.177
[SPEAKER_07]: Electric Boogaloo.

01:11:37.517 --> 01:11:38.898
[SPEAKER_12]: Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

01:11:38.938 --> 01:11:42.362
[SPEAKER_12]: Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.

01:11:42.442 --> 01:11:43.323
[SPEAKER_07]: You said Wii Wii.

01:11:44.944 --> 01:11:48.087
[SPEAKER_12]: I said Wii Wii U. Wii Wii U.

01:11:50.666 --> 01:11:52.167
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, then I guess we travel to Japan.

01:11:52.367 --> 01:11:52.988
[SPEAKER_11]: That was quick.

01:11:53.548 --> 01:11:54.929
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at some of the release dates in Japan.

01:11:54.989 --> 01:11:58.011
[SPEAKER_11]: On the PlayStation 3 this week, quite a bit actually.

01:11:58.111 --> 01:12:03.395
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragon's Crown, Ketsui, Kizuna, Jigoku Tachi Extra in regular and limited edition.

01:12:03.936 --> 01:12:07.358
[SPEAKER_11]: Majo Tohai Kihei comes out as well in regular and limited.

01:12:08.119 --> 01:12:11.681
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Race Driver Grid 2 and X-Blade Code Embryo.

01:12:11.981 --> 01:12:16.064
[SPEAKER_11]: And Zone of the Enders HD Edition gets a price reduction this week.

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:16.605
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:20.007
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots and lots of releases there.

01:12:20.247 --> 01:12:30.453
[SPEAKER_11]: Also going to on the Xbox 360, I don't think there's really anything on the 360.

01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:32.134
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, what did you expect?

01:12:33.375 --> 01:12:35.476
[SPEAKER_11]: Also looking at the PlayStation Vita.

01:12:39.145 --> 01:12:48.599
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragon's Crown, X-Blaze Code Embryo, Next Rev Iken, Dragon's Crown Famitsu Pack

01:12:53.341 --> 01:13:17.087
[SPEAKER_11]: and looking at the let's see on the Wii U the Wii U does have Lego City undercover getting its Japanese release this week and also a new gamepad battery pack which I think was reported on a couple weeks ago that is actually getting its release in Japan this week as far as peripherals go going to the 3DS Gaikuten Saiban 5 is finally released from Capcom and

01:13:17.508 --> 01:13:24.761
[SPEAKER_11]: and that is the Phoenix Wright game basically Ace Attorney that's the one with Apollo and all the folks in it is that the one that's rated M?

01:13:25.102 --> 01:13:27.126
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I heard I don't think so

01:13:27.952 --> 01:13:29.073
[SPEAKER_11]: for its release over here.

01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:34.817
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, that is out in Japan this week, and there's a whole lot of peripherals to come with that.

01:13:35.237 --> 01:13:39.680
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantasy Life Link and Chibi Devil 2, Mahou no Yume Ihon.

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:40.200
[SPEAKER_11]: Toh.

01:13:41.721 --> 01:13:42.982
[SPEAKER_11]: And... Is that... No.

01:13:43.683 --> 01:13:44.643
[SPEAKER_11]: It was no, not toh.

01:13:44.783 --> 01:13:45.684
[SPEAKER_11]: Toh, oh.

01:13:45.784 --> 01:13:52.048
[SPEAKER_11]: Beast Saga Saikyou Gekutosu Coliseum comes out on the 3DS this week.

01:13:52.088 --> 01:13:52.869
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a busy week in Japan.

01:13:52.889 --> 01:13:53.469
[SPEAKER_07]: That's interesting.

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:54.290
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:54.690
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:57.672
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've seen that before somewhere, but I don't know.

01:14:00.524 --> 01:14:04.907
[SPEAKER_11]: And lastly, yes, there are still PCP, or PCP, PSP games coming.

01:14:05.727 --> 01:14:08.769
[SPEAKER_11]: Daya no Kuni no Alice, Wonderful Mirror World.

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:11.931
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that's based off like Alice in Wonderland type of game.

01:14:12.212 --> 01:14:13.833
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it is, or Through the Looking Glass.

01:14:13.953 --> 01:14:15.914
[SPEAKER_11]: Like an anime, oh yeah, see, look.

01:14:16.454 --> 01:14:19.897
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mad Hatter is a sexy... That's the March Hare.

01:14:20.077 --> 01:14:21.798
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the Mad Hatter's right behind him.

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:26.421
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all sexy, like, you know, anime style.

01:14:27.121 --> 01:14:47.493
[SPEAKER_07]: and Toki no Keizuna Hanamatsubi to Zuri comes out in regular and limited edition and there's a twin pack as well lots of games not so many for the UK on the 22nd we have RuneScape 3 for PC on the 25th I have no idea how this is supposed to say rimmed capsule is that it?

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:55.798
[SPEAKER_07]: rimmed capsule on iPad, Android, and iPhone Shadowrun returns for iPad, Android, Mac, and PC and on the 26th we have Pikmin 3 for Wii U

01:14:57.682 --> 01:14:58.002
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over.

01:15:11.488 --> 01:15:29.494
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people would say that the Xbox One might be a little rushed or even some of these next-gen systems, but there was some news that came out regarding Forza Motorsports 5 saying that the game was going to require a one-time download before it can be played.

01:15:30.354 --> 01:15:42.059
[SPEAKER_12]: and that they were basically at such a crunch for time that they were putting the framework of the game together.

01:15:42.199 --> 01:15:49.102
[SPEAKER_12]: They're getting that pressed to disk and then they were going to be working on the tracks up until launch.

01:15:50.746 --> 01:16:02.129
[SPEAKER_12]: and so basically you would buy the game and then you'd have to download the rest um you know when you first put the game in the system so you would need to be connected to the internet now

01:16:04.167 --> 01:16:06.168
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, there's been some back and forth about it.

01:16:06.288 --> 01:16:19.074
[SPEAKER_12]: They said, I guess Turn 10's Dan Greenwald, he changed his statement saying that the requirement of a connection to Xbox Live before playing is not the plan.

01:16:19.974 --> 01:16:25.756
[SPEAKER_12]: However, when or if the game requires an internet connection for single player content, it's still not clear.

01:16:26.417 --> 01:16:26.677
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

01:16:30.333 --> 01:16:31.354
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

01:16:48.473 --> 01:16:55.239
[SPEAKER_12]: When you get to the point where the game is literally not done, it is admitted to be, it is not done.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:56.700
[SPEAKER_12]: The game is not done.

01:16:57.041 --> 01:17:07.310
[SPEAKER_12]: And now they need to put it on a disc so that you download the rest of the content later because they want to hit that launch window or whatever.

01:17:07.971 --> 01:17:08.931
[SPEAKER_12]: That's ridiculous.

01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:11.033
[SPEAKER_12]: That is absolutely ridiculous.

01:17:11.113 --> 01:17:12.555
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, I just...

01:17:14.356 --> 01:17:15.277
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the point?

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.238
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't understand.

01:17:41.098 --> 01:17:56.067
[SPEAKER_11]: that really sucks for those people that don't have the internet connection which was a big part of the push to get Xbox One to reverse their policies to begin with and it's not even the internet connection thing let's just skip the whole like people that don't have internet okay because a lot of people do have internet

01:17:57.054 --> 01:18:00.857
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still going to take a long time to download the rest of the content for that game.

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:08.383
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know DLC and stuff that includes actual new art assets and stuff for at least a few hundred meg.

01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:22.134
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you're talking that, you know, let's just assume that the majority of the tracks are on the game, you're talking like a multi-gig download that even on somewhat decent bandwidth or whatever...

01:18:25.376 --> 01:18:28.817
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to take at least an hour to download.

01:18:28.977 --> 01:18:31.438
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to really want to have to deal with that bullshit?

01:18:32.158 --> 01:18:38.160
[SPEAKER_12]: That you have to download a big portion of the game in the first place to be able to even play the single player campaign?

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.881
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's just kind of ridiculous that they even would do that.

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:43.131
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

01:18:44.531 --> 01:18:51.613
[SPEAKER_12]: And is this something that says, okay, yeah, we're going to have this extra content that we're building up to launch.

01:18:51.873 --> 01:18:57.435
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that mean that later on after it launches that they're going to put all that content onto the disc later on?

01:18:57.755 --> 01:19:01.376
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they going to do that or are they just going to say, ah, fuck it, whatever?

01:19:04.555 --> 01:19:09.758
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is too much of the letting the day one patch fix your problems.

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:13.380
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, if this game isn't ready at launch, then don't launch it with it.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:14.921
[SPEAKER_12]: Launch it a couple weeks later.

01:19:15.101 --> 01:19:17.442
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fine, because you're already going to have games coming out.

01:19:17.822 --> 01:19:19.543
[SPEAKER_12]: So what if it doesn't come out day one?

01:19:20.143 --> 01:19:20.544
[SPEAKER_12]: That's okay.

01:19:20.564 --> 01:19:24.306
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sometimes good to have things a little later, too.

01:19:24.606 --> 01:19:25.866
[SPEAKER_11]: The Wii U could have used that.

01:19:26.187 --> 01:19:30.949
[SPEAKER_12]: Infamous isn't coming out day one and stuff, and I just don't understand why they wouldn't push it.

01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:38.037
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say that a lot of release dates for games have to do with money and advertising.

01:19:39.298 --> 01:19:43.159
[SPEAKER_07]: With advertising, with deals with distributors.

01:19:43.799 --> 01:19:45.460
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think that that's where a lot of it comes into.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:52.062
[SPEAKER_07]: So they set this date that may or may not be realistic and don't want to violate that date.

01:19:52.122 --> 01:19:55.943
[SPEAKER_07]: So they go ahead and ship and keep working on it so that they have the patches ready.

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:57.604
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my thought on why they do that.

01:19:57.704 --> 01:20:00.445
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would personally prefer them to wait.

01:20:01.246 --> 01:20:02.188
[SPEAKER_12]: I can just shift the date of it.

01:20:02.789 --> 01:20:09.180
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand, yeah, that people plan ahead for advertising, but they're planning holiday advertisements and stuff.

01:20:10.322 --> 01:20:12.165
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little closer than now.

01:20:12.305 --> 01:20:12.846
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, now is...

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:15.437
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

01:20:33.759 --> 01:20:38.041
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a big problem if you know that you're not going to hit your launch and you're already how many months out?

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:39.541
[SPEAKER_12]: Just push it.

01:20:39.621 --> 01:20:41.542
[SPEAKER_12]: Just push the game if it's not going to be ready.

01:20:41.822 --> 01:20:43.983
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the question is, are other games going to be like this?

01:20:44.083 --> 01:20:46.083
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going to see the same thing with Rise?

01:20:46.143 --> 01:20:49.564
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they've rushed the launch for this system.

01:20:49.624 --> 01:20:52.245
[SPEAKER_12]: Hasn't Rise been worked on for quite some time now?

01:20:52.365 --> 01:20:52.985
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter.

01:20:53.106 --> 01:20:53.566
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

01:20:53.626 --> 01:20:57.907
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's been games that have shipped incomplete before.

01:20:58.127 --> 01:21:00.628
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just not... I don't know.

01:21:01.368 --> 01:21:03.189
[SPEAKER_12]: It's disheartening, I guess.

01:21:04.029 --> 01:21:05.030
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, whatever.

01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:06.530
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not going to tell anybody about it.

01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:08.531
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I guess they did.

01:21:08.551 --> 01:21:09.171
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of weird.

01:21:09.591 --> 01:21:11.232
[SPEAKER_12]: They probably won't tell the general public about it.

01:21:11.932 --> 01:21:15.834
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be on the box saying, hey, you need to connect to the internet to play this.

01:21:16.034 --> 01:21:16.834
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all incentives.

01:21:17.234 --> 01:21:21.576
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well here's a game I'm sure they will have no problem delaying until it's damn near perfect.

01:21:21.656 --> 01:21:24.297
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I mean, sometimes this game gets bugs too.

01:21:25.017 --> 01:21:28.078
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a pretty infamous one on the Wii release of Zelda.

01:21:28.659 --> 01:21:29.459
[SPEAKER_11]: And, come on.

01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:31.121
[SPEAKER_11]: Zeldagame on the Wii U

01:21:45.178 --> 01:21:47.420
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like, yes, it's coming, but...

01:22:10.666 --> 01:22:11.467
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be awesome.

01:22:11.627 --> 01:22:12.307
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it's coming.

01:22:12.548 --> 01:22:15.470
[SPEAKER_12]: And the demo is on the Wind Waker HD disc.

01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:18.072
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome, but probably not happening.

01:22:20.254 --> 01:22:31.743
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, what I really wanted to talk about was an interview with Aonuma who was talking about the tired formula of traditional Zelda games.

01:22:31.823 --> 01:22:33.264
[SPEAKER_11]: I might be kind of...

01:22:34.605 --> 01:22:35.326
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tired.

01:22:57.182 --> 01:22:57.942
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

01:23:20.814 --> 01:23:21.074
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:23:21.395 --> 01:23:25.238
[SPEAKER_11]: Despite the whole fact that he says he's getting tired of it, I wouldn't read too much into that.

01:23:25.378 --> 01:23:34.666
[SPEAKER_11]: I just would think that the next game is going to probably not necessarily be quite like Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess and all that.

01:23:35.106 --> 01:23:36.147
[SPEAKER_11]: It might have some differences.

01:23:36.207 --> 01:23:37.428
[SPEAKER_11]: But we've already heard about that.

01:23:37.889 --> 01:23:44.154
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember a story about three, four months ago that Skyrim was influencing Zelda as well a little bit.

01:23:45.115 --> 01:23:46.136
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe something more open world?

01:23:46.996 --> 01:23:58.883
[SPEAKER_11]: I would, well, I mean, Zelda kind of already is pretty open world, the more recent ones, but I mean, maybe a little less, I mean, the dungeons could be fluid, but it isn't even like that in Skyrim.

01:23:59.123 --> 01:24:04.466
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you go through a transition from open world to... I used to be an adventurer, but I took a hookshot to the knee.

01:24:05.947 --> 01:24:06.407
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

01:24:08.642 --> 01:24:08.682
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

01:24:35.767 --> 01:24:39.371
[SPEAKER_11]: Slidekick is in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and says, that's great news.

01:24:39.752 --> 01:24:44.897
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Zelda, but Skyward Sword was a step forward in the right direction and they need to continue to experiment with it.

01:24:45.718 --> 01:24:47.260
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you go.

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:50.263
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully we'll get more info on this soon.

01:24:51.244 --> 01:24:55.425
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the meantime, let's go back to a more classic era of video games.

01:24:55.945 --> 01:24:56.986
[SPEAKER_11]: I was really short.

01:24:57.166 --> 01:25:02.968
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to when Zelda 2 was completely breaking the formula and some people hated it for that.

01:25:02.988 --> 01:25:03.408
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

01:25:03.508 --> 01:25:04.888
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go earlier than that.

01:25:04.928 --> 01:25:06.629
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go even earlier than that.

01:25:06.829 --> 01:25:08.769
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to me being six years old.

01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:10.250
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.

01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:13.311
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this a game that was on like...

01:25:14.406 --> 01:25:16.629
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to stand on a step stool to play it.

01:25:17.811 --> 01:25:18.532
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it Pong?

01:25:18.853 --> 01:25:19.173
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:20.375
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that old.

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:21.436
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it Space War?

01:25:21.677 --> 01:25:21.957
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:23.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl, please.

01:25:23.559 --> 01:25:25.342
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, it's the classic game of the week.

01:25:25.362 --> 01:25:30.209
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura's gonna jump into her gaming vault and pull a game out of her butt that she framed.

01:25:31.738 --> 01:25:33.259
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's Kangaroo.

01:25:33.279 --> 01:25:35.600
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna jump right into it.

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:36.220
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha.

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:41.623
[SPEAKER_07]: It was done by Sun Electronics, distributed by Atari.

01:25:42.764 --> 01:25:46.225
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's sort of like a cross between Donkey Kong and Popeye.

01:25:46.986 --> 01:25:50.828
[SPEAKER_07]: You basically play a mother kangaroo who has to rescue her baby, her little Joey.

01:25:51.288 --> 01:25:54.930
[SPEAKER_07]: You go through the treetops and beat up monkeys.

01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:57.431
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not aware that there were monkeys in Australia.

01:25:57.571 --> 01:25:58.592
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there monkeys in Australia?

01:25:58.992 --> 01:26:00.032
[SPEAKER_07]: There's kangaroos in Australia.

01:26:00.673 --> 01:26:01.373
[SPEAKER_07]: But why are there monkeys?

01:26:03.479 --> 01:26:05.190
[SPEAKER_11]: They run the other direction.

01:26:05.472 --> 01:26:05.673
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:26:07.341 --> 01:26:11.503
[SPEAKER_07]: My thought is that they're really criminals because you know that's how Australia was started.

01:26:11.523 --> 01:26:14.765
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and I know the Australians love it when you point that out, DarkSakura.

01:26:16.366 --> 01:26:17.766
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're pink criminals.

01:26:18.227 --> 01:26:19.287
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to go with that.

01:26:19.327 --> 01:26:20.228
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my headcanon.

01:26:20.288 --> 01:26:21.628
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot convince me otherwise.

01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:33.535
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can punch apples and throw them at... They throw apples at you and you can punch them and you can knock down the monkeys with it.

01:26:33.755 --> 01:26:33.935
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

01:26:34.415 --> 01:26:38.438
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you go up ladders through trees to rescue your baby kangaroo.

01:26:39.318 --> 01:26:47.864
[SPEAKER_07]: There are four different levels, and basically, like I said, you rescue the joey, and you get apples thrown at you, and you get to beat up the mean monkeys.

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:53.248
[SPEAKER_07]: You can punch them with your boxing gloves, and you can punch the apples, and you can punch other fruit.

01:26:53.288 --> 01:26:54.528
[SPEAKER_07]: You just go around punching shit.

01:26:55.629 --> 01:27:00.292
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you have to be, um, watch out for the big ape who tries to take your gloves away.

01:27:00.332 --> 01:27:02.333
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't punch him if you don't have boxing gloves.

01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:05.535
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would just think that a kangaroo could kick him in the face.

01:27:06.175 --> 01:27:09.157
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I imagine that being kicked by a kangaroo would really freaking hurt.

01:27:10.663 --> 01:27:30.511
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the third level is a different one, because the baby kangaroo is actually being held up by monkeys, and you get apples that basically get sent up on you for when you climb up there, so you have to punch the monkey several times until the cage is open.

01:27:31.631 --> 01:27:32.212
[SPEAKER_07]: Punch the monkey.

01:27:33.718 --> 01:27:34.258
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

01:27:48.759 --> 01:28:13.612
[SPEAKER_07]: and you have Westminster Quarters where the bell plays too and Marcia alla Turca which was well music inspired by that by Beethoven so anyway it came out on the Atari 2600 and the 5200 which I have both copies of the 5200 version is super good never play it with a trackball by the way because you will want to shoot yourself in the face

01:28:15.177 --> 01:28:21.161
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Kangaroo was actually involved with the Saturday Supercade.

01:28:21.181 --> 01:28:21.902
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember that, Rob?

01:28:22.682 --> 01:28:23.222
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually do.

01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:23.222
1984.

01:28:24.743 --> 01:28:28.526
[SPEAKER_07]: Kangaroo and Space Ace replaced Pitfall Harry, Frogger, and Donkey Kong Jr.

01:28:28.586 --> 01:28:29.667
[SPEAKER_07]: for segments on that show.

01:28:30.607 --> 01:28:44.897
[SPEAKER_07]: And so basically, the kangaroos were Katie and Joey, and they lived in a zoo run by Mr. Friendly, and they were friends with Sidney the Squirrel, and they had to fight the Monkey Biz gang.

01:28:46.558 --> 01:28:47.978
[SPEAKER_07]: Which you know who... Oh, that's actually cool.

01:28:47.998 --> 01:28:48.398
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know that.

01:28:48.458 --> 01:28:50.699
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the voices for one of the monkeys was Frank Welker.

01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:53.201
[SPEAKER_07]: They were Bingo, Bango, Bongo, and Fred.

01:28:54.641 --> 01:28:55.842
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually get this on DVD?

01:28:55.882 --> 01:28:56.462
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

01:28:56.482 --> 01:28:58.083
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to go get those on DVD.

01:28:58.563 --> 01:28:59.563
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Kangaroo.

01:29:00.544 --> 01:29:01.064
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun game.

01:29:02.925 --> 01:29:05.106
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, here's my background story on this one.

01:29:06.226 --> 01:29:07.087
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine 1982.

01:29:08.827 --> 01:29:09.648
[SPEAKER_07]: Six years old.

01:29:10.068 --> 01:29:12.049
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in first grade.

01:29:12.969 --> 01:29:14.250
[SPEAKER_07]: At Godfather's Pizza.

01:29:17.357 --> 01:29:21.338
[SPEAKER_07]: Neeling on this weird stool trying to play freaking kangaroo.

01:29:22.898 --> 01:29:27.359
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kept running back for quarters because I was bound and determined to punch those damn monkeys.

01:29:28.499 --> 01:29:29.720
[SPEAKER_07]: And I punched some monkeys.

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.141
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us more about how you punch the monkeys.

01:29:35.081 --> 01:29:36.221
[SPEAKER_07]: I punch monkeys all the time.

01:29:36.241 --> 01:29:40.482
[SPEAKER_07]: So they give a throwing poo and yanking it in the zoo.

01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:43.743
[SPEAKER_07]: Monkeys are nasty little bastards.

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.541
[SPEAKER_07]: I love monkeys.

01:29:46.601 --> 01:29:47.161
[SPEAKER_07]: I love lemurs.

01:29:49.442 --> 01:29:51.723
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone said, do you want a monkey or a lemur?

01:29:51.883 --> 01:29:52.824
[SPEAKER_07]: I pick a lemur every time.

01:29:54.124 --> 01:29:54.645
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a kangaroo.

01:29:55.645 --> 01:29:58.667
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the hell that has to do with the game, but that's so funny.

01:29:58.687 --> 01:29:59.067
[SPEAKER_07]: Monkeys!

01:29:59.687 --> 01:30:00.288
[SPEAKER_07]: Punching monkeys.

01:30:00.468 --> 01:30:01.028
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.

01:30:01.528 --> 01:30:04.310
[SPEAKER_11]: The punching monkey classic, Kangaroo.

01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:07.071
[SPEAKER_11]: Available in arcades everywhere.

01:30:07.371 --> 01:30:08.152
[SPEAKER_11]: Punching monkeys.

01:30:09.352 --> 01:30:11.093
[SPEAKER_11]: Look for it where you can punch your favorite monkeys.

01:30:11.113 --> 01:30:13.434
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw posted up the intro to the kangaroo cartoon.

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:14.735
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

01:30:15.495 --> 01:30:16.135
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

01:30:16.295 --> 01:30:17.856
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing is as awesome as punching a monkey.

01:30:19.517 --> 01:30:20.798
[SPEAKER_07]: I stand by my monkey punching.

01:30:21.158 --> 01:30:23.379
[SPEAKER_11]: There's your classic game of the week.

01:30:23.419 --> 01:30:24.460
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I didn't say donkey.

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.301
[SPEAKER_11]: I was waiting the whole time for you to make a donkey punch.

01:30:28.361 --> 01:30:28.662
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

01:30:28.922 --> 01:30:30.563
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't going to say it, but I did anyway.

01:30:30.883 --> 01:30:35.285
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take a break, and DarkSakura's got to go punch a monkey or two.

01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:37.326
[SPEAKER_11]: When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:30:37.586 --> 01:30:38.326
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have monkeys?

01:30:38.547 --> 01:30:40.828
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of responses to the Fugo question of the week.

01:30:40.928 --> 01:30:42.328
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just a cat, and you can't punch her.

01:30:42.389 --> 01:30:42.949
[SPEAKER_11]: She doesn't like that.

01:30:43.569 --> 01:30:45.170
[SPEAKER_07]: I will punch her by petting her.

01:30:45.699 --> 01:30:47.242
[SPEAKER_11]: and the mailbag, maybe.

01:30:47.342 --> 01:30:47.582
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:30:47.603 --> 01:30:49.246
[SPEAKER_11]: There were no emails in there this morning when I looked.

01:30:49.286 --> 01:30:49.627
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

01:30:49.687 --> 01:30:51.010
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, aw.

01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:55.759
[SPEAKER_11]: And your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.301
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay tuned.

01:30:56.581 --> 01:30:56.862
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:31:03.766 --> 01:31:12.548
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi there, this is Captain Spike and First Mate Slagkick from GameBooey.org GameBooey.org And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:31:12.608 --> 01:31:18.829
[SPEAKER_14]: And we want to use our voice to tell you support indie broadcasting and congratulations to Orange Lounge Radio on 11 wonderful years.

01:31:18.969 --> 01:31:19.829
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:20.829
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

01:31:21.169 --> 01:31:22.549
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

01:31:22.969 --> 01:31:25.050
[SPEAKER_11]: Is my mic off?

01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.390
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:30.411
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to our friends at GameBooey.org for that bumper.

01:31:30.911 --> 01:31:31.671
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate it.

01:31:33.248 --> 01:31:39.372
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes I wish we did a tape show like they did so that way I could cover up all those screw-ups when they happen like I don't have my mic on.

01:31:41.633 --> 01:31:43.134
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the second time you've heard that bumper.

01:31:43.194 --> 01:31:47.977
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because we're not getting any more bumpers from our listeners.

01:31:48.197 --> 01:31:49.078
[SPEAKER_11]: Shame on all of you.

01:31:49.278 --> 01:31:50.899
[SPEAKER_11]: So you should definitely send us some.

01:31:51.659 --> 01:31:57.623
[SPEAKER_11]: Check the forums over at vognetwork.com and you can send us a bumper and you can tell us whatever you want.

01:31:57.703 --> 01:32:00.685
[SPEAKER_11]: Use your voice here on the program to tell us whatever you want.

01:32:01.125 --> 01:32:05.228
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of people giving their voices to the Fugle Question of the Week here in a little bit.

01:32:05.288 --> 01:32:06.289
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll play that.

01:32:07.169 --> 01:32:08.790
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get to that in a little bit here.

01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:12.133
[SPEAKER_11]: But first, we have some rapid-fire news we've got to go over.

01:32:13.073 --> 01:32:13.974
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

01:32:14.774 --> 01:32:15.155
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:32:15.595 --> 01:32:21.759
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's talk a little bit about the awesome game that is Saints Row 4.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:28.684
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is some wonderful news that came out from a panel at Comic-Con, actually.

01:32:29.204 --> 01:32:45.499
[SPEAKER_12]: and they were talking a little bit about some of the scrapped ideas that they had originally the end of the game was going to have a Bollywood dance number which that's awesome outstanding the only problem was it wasn't possible for them to do that because of the cost

01:32:46.499 --> 01:33:05.391
[SPEAKER_12]: by the time they figured out which Bollywood song to license and also doing all the choreography and stuff like that and the motion capture it was just going to be too much so they just couldn't end up doing that although I'm sure the ending of the game is going to be awesome

01:33:05.931 --> 01:33:08.913
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, though, they said that there's some really interesting details in the game.

01:33:08.933 --> 01:33:14.195
[SPEAKER_12]: They're kind of calling it, they're joking that the Saints Rose about the arts.

01:33:14.615 --> 01:33:31.324
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess they have one of the in-game radio stations where the evil alien guy, Zinyak, he's actually reading a bunch of different classical literature, including monologues from Shakespeare and even the entire first chapter of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.

01:33:33.163 --> 01:33:35.805
[SPEAKER_12]: Spoiler alert, I will not be listening to that station.

01:33:36.285 --> 01:33:40.888
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be listening to the dubstep dance electronica station, as I always do.

01:33:41.269 --> 01:33:46.952
[SPEAKER_12]: And probably flipping between that and the 80s station, because I hear the 80s station is pretty awesome.

01:33:46.992 --> 01:33:49.454
[SPEAKER_11]: Will you listen to your dubstep while you use your dubstep gun?

01:33:49.474 --> 01:33:50.114
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

01:33:50.235 --> 01:33:52.736
[SPEAKER_11]: And chew your dubstep gum?

01:33:53.036 --> 01:33:55.458
[SPEAKER_12]: Assuming that I can fire that out the window, yes.

01:33:56.098 --> 01:33:57.079
[SPEAKER_12]: Most likely, no.

01:33:58.700 --> 01:33:58.980
[SPEAKER_12]: Amazing.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:33:59.721
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe this.

01:34:00.697 --> 01:34:01.278
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't wait.

01:34:01.658 --> 01:34:02.899
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not much longer now, right?

01:34:02.939 --> 01:34:03.760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.141
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting to that point of the year.

01:34:05.201 --> 01:34:05.962
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting closer.

01:34:06.982 --> 01:34:07.563
[SPEAKER_11]: What is today?

01:34:07.663 --> 01:34:10.625
[SPEAKER_11]: July 21st.

01:34:10.766 --> 01:34:15.810
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like five weeks away from Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, just saying.

01:34:16.069 --> 01:34:18.051
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be a tight schedule, so that's all good.

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:21.735
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so I guess here's a positive.

01:34:22.015 --> 01:34:33.367
[SPEAKER_12]: Xbox One is also going to support partial download support, or I should say partial download play, meaning that while a game is being downloaded, you will be able to play the game thanks to the cloud.

01:34:36.909 --> 01:34:37.850
[SPEAKER_11]: When the cloud works.

01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:38.590
[SPEAKER_11]: When the cloud works.

01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:46.576
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy 7 is in the indication, though granted the servers are not even run by the same company, but I'm just saying.

01:34:46.996 --> 01:34:52.120
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps you have to level up Cloud so that he has his limit break, and limit break is cloud saving.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.541
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you get the limit break at level 1.

01:34:53.701 --> 01:34:55.362
[SPEAKER_11]: You get to use limit breaks at the beginning of the game.

01:34:55.822 --> 01:34:56.343
[SPEAKER_11]: Where have you been?

01:34:57.629 --> 01:35:00.070
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's try to limit break.

01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:01.991
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh, troll comment in our chatroom.

01:35:02.632 --> 01:35:05.313
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really, but live.vognetwork.com, I'm going to read it anyway.

01:35:05.734 --> 01:35:10.476
[SPEAKER_11]: MaskedBishop in our chatroom says, I'm still trying to figure out the selling point of the Saints Row series.

01:35:11.056 --> 01:35:11.377
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki?

01:35:12.557 --> 01:35:13.878
[SPEAKER_12]: It depends which one you're talking about.

01:35:13.898 --> 01:35:16.119
[SPEAKER_12]: The original Saints Row games were kind of like a Grand Theft Auto.

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:22.743
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, Saints Row 1 for me was, hey, Grand Theft Auto is on the Xbox 360, I'm going to play this game, and it was fun.

01:35:23.563 --> 01:35:29.125
[SPEAKER_12]: I think kind of the last few games it's just been so over the top and ridiculous that it's entertaining.

01:35:29.985 --> 01:35:35.968
[SPEAKER_12]: And Bobby is informing me, yes, you can listen to the radio anytime because it's cyberspace and the radio stations are injected directly into your brain.

01:35:36.388 --> 01:35:36.648
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

01:35:36.668 --> 01:35:41.109
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, you can listen to the dubstep while firing a dubstep gun.

01:35:41.129 --> 01:35:41.690
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray.

01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:43.110
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let me say this.

01:35:43.570 --> 01:35:45.111
[SPEAKER_11]: In my experience with at least Saints Row 3...

01:35:45.911 --> 01:36:04.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Saint's Row is good for the same reason that This Is The End was good it's fucking ridiculous and dumb as hell but you can't help but laugh like it's just over the top stupid it's beyond over the top yeah like and some of the things in that movie were just ridiculous but I laughed like it was so funny

01:36:04.344 --> 01:36:05.305
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not true.

01:36:05.405 --> 01:36:10.809
[SPEAKER_12]: Grand Theft Auto is trying to take itself kind of like an Oscar movie, I guess, where it's very well done.

01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:13.351
[SPEAKER_11]: Grand Theft Auto is a little ridiculous in itself.

01:36:13.451 --> 01:36:24.120
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a little ridiculous, but they're definitely going along the lines of realism, like the amount of detail that they have in the game with the whole stock markets and just all the stuff you can do in the game.

01:36:25.821 --> 01:36:30.665
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going one way with Grand Theft Auto, whereas Saints Row is kind of going the complete opposite direction.

01:36:30.725 --> 01:36:33.307
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just like, hey, you know what would be fun is if we have superpowers.

01:36:33.427 --> 01:36:34.107
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going to explain it?

01:36:34.327 --> 01:36:34.827
[SPEAKER_12]: Eh, whatever.

01:36:34.847 --> 01:36:36.168
[SPEAKER_12]: He's in the Matrix now.

01:36:36.228 --> 01:36:37.088
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, they're done.

01:36:37.188 --> 01:36:37.788
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sweet.

01:36:38.909 --> 01:36:40.629
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, we were going to have a gun that fires dubstep.

01:36:41.949 --> 01:36:42.329
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:43.330
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just ridiculous.

01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:44.370
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to be ridiculous.

01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.951
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the whole point.

01:36:46.991 --> 01:36:50.112
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if that's the type of game you want to play, then play Saints Row.

01:36:50.292 --> 01:36:52.832
[SPEAKER_12]: I honestly think you should play both because they're both awesome.

01:36:53.573 --> 01:36:55.393
[SPEAKER_12]: I will be playing both a lot.

01:36:56.833 --> 01:36:58.474
[SPEAKER_12]: So much so that I'm probably not going to get PlayStation 4 now.

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:14.547
[SPEAKER_11]: BlackWolf and TimTrip are having a conversation in our chatroom about it and BlackWolf says Tim, Saints Row 4 is basically Grand Theft Auto meets Crackdown meets over-the-top humor especially with their version of the Crackdown orbs Oh, Alan's here to give comment Hi Alan

01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:29.201
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, just want to say, because I beat Grand Theft Auto 4 all the way through just a couple weeks ago, after the insanity of GTA 3 San Andreas, which there was a lot of crazy stuff in that, a lot of people thought that 4 proper with Nico Bellic was too dry.

01:37:29.221 --> 01:37:32.063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very bleak and just super serious.

01:37:32.083 --> 01:37:34.425
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, did you play through the ballad of Gay Tony?

01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:37.932
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm only, like, an hour into Lost and Damned.

01:37:37.992 --> 01:37:42.174
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, yeah, when you get to Valley of Daytona, it's kind of like they're trying to bring it back towards San Andreas.

01:37:42.614 --> 01:37:47.097
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, honestly, that was, like, the best as far as, like, playing with the weapon set and stuff like that.

01:37:47.177 --> 01:37:47.677
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the best.

01:37:47.757 --> 01:37:58.003
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I guess you can tell already from the gameplay trailer for 5 that they realize that they don't want to turn the dial up to Saints Row crazy, but they need to have more over-the-top...

01:37:58.923 --> 01:38:00.104
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff in it, I think.

01:38:00.124 --> 01:38:04.105
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just giving you more freedom without going crazy with the stuff that's in there.

01:38:04.145 --> 01:38:05.526
[SPEAKER_04]: In San Andreas, wasn't there like a big wheel?

01:38:05.826 --> 01:38:07.586
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it wasn't mod, you could just drive a big wheel around?

01:38:09.547 --> 01:38:10.487
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember.

01:38:10.788 --> 01:38:11.308
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while.

01:38:11.348 --> 01:38:16.750
[SPEAKER_04]: You could like parachute off buildings, a lot of crazy stuff, and then 4 was very, very bleak.

01:38:19.236 --> 01:38:23.217
[SPEAKER_11]: Captain Spike in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Eh, I want games to be fun.

01:38:23.578 --> 01:38:24.218
[SPEAKER_11]: Games and all.

01:38:24.318 --> 01:38:26.518
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really here for Grand Theft Auto's fourth story.

01:38:26.578 --> 01:38:28.879
[SPEAKER_11]: Wants to be an Oscar-winning movie bullshit or whatever.

01:38:28.939 --> 01:38:29.519
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fun.

01:38:29.599 --> 01:38:31.080
[SPEAKER_11]: You just don't play the main storyline.

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:31.540
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares?

01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:36.122
[SPEAKER_11]: Once in a while, I'm okay with Oscar-worthy video games, though.

01:38:36.182 --> 01:38:37.942
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, Journey is like a Night of the Mets, right?

01:38:37.962 --> 01:38:39.383
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, Saints Row the Third is fun.

01:38:39.643 --> 01:38:40.303
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty fun.

01:38:41.244 --> 01:38:48.448
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a little bit of repetition when it comes to some of the activities and stuff, but I think Saints Row III was fun, and Saints Row II was actually pretty fun.

01:38:48.549 --> 01:38:51.030
[SPEAKER_12]: So Saints Row IV sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun too.

01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.971
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's move on.

01:38:51.991 --> 01:38:52.791
[SPEAKER_11]: We got derailed a little bit.

01:38:52.811 --> 01:38:53.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you just say your thing?

01:38:53.892 --> 01:38:54.993
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I haven't done that yet.

01:38:55.733 --> 01:39:03.379
[SPEAKER_12]: Last but not least, they're trying to bring back sort of a spiritual successor to Police Quest.

01:39:04.119 --> 01:39:06.201
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually being done by the same creator.

01:39:07.281 --> 01:39:14.486
[SPEAKER_12]: Robert Lindsley is trying to kickstart a game called Precinct.

01:39:15.427 --> 01:39:18.629
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, their funding goal is half a million dollars.

01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:24.673
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, the game is going to be very similar to...

01:39:25.974 --> 01:39:51.496
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess the police quest series and if you're looking to get a game similar to that then maybe you should try backing this right now as a recording they are up to $50,000 probably actually close to $51,000 still a ways away from their goal but they have 25 days left so there is a chance and some of the concept art looks actually pretty sweet it's all like first person you have like the patrol view and stuff like that looks like it could be pretty cool

01:39:54.548 --> 01:39:59.771
[SPEAKER_12]: and I like their precinct funding chart here they said our campaign 500,000 awesome 600,000 awesomer 700,000 mega awesome 800,000 plus badonk

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:17.442
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well hopefully this movie will be pretty badonk, but the first signs of the World of Warcraft movie was shown at Comic-Con.

01:40:17.482 --> 01:40:19.803
[SPEAKER_11]: The teaser trailer unveiled at Comic-Con.

01:40:20.083 --> 01:40:29.206
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the thing, the movie doesn't have any stars attached yet, so there wasn't really a lot to show, but the teaser did have a mix of live action and computer generated effects.

01:40:29.986 --> 01:40:37.509
[SPEAKER_11]: It was out in a desert field and had an armored human warrior that drank a potion and then drew a sword just before battling a hammer wielding orc.

01:40:38.489 --> 01:40:46.934
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, as we all know, Duncan Jones, who did Source Code and Moon, and also importantly is David Bowie's son, is helming the Warcraft film.

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:49.175
[SPEAKER_11]: It's supposed to begin shooting in early 2014.

01:40:49.715 --> 01:40:52.157
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming that means released in probably 2015.

01:40:53.758 --> 01:40:57.520
[SPEAKER_12]: Can Bowie get like a monarch position in the movie?

01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.301
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love that.

01:40:59.461 --> 01:41:01.162
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps the king of the goblins?

01:41:01.582 --> 01:41:07.747
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the reason why he goes by the name Duncan Jones is he doesn't want to be in the shadow of his dad, though.

01:41:07.927 --> 01:41:12.871
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would really, really be surprised if David Bowie turns up in this at all.

01:41:13.152 --> 01:41:16.394
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe he can do a little dance magic dance.

01:41:17.495 --> 01:41:21.117
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, by the way, this clip is not on the internet for us to see.

01:41:21.217 --> 01:41:22.658
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it leaked out to YouTube.

01:41:22.678 --> 01:41:23.679
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it's out there somewhere.

01:41:24.019 --> 01:41:39.889
[SPEAKER_11]: But Blizzard has said there is no plans to release the mood piece that was shown at Comic-Con that was only for Comic-Con and not for public consumption, which I'm actually okay with because, again, it's not real footage from the movie, so to speak, because there's no stars attached yet or anything.

01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:40.149
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

01:41:40.949 --> 01:41:42.791
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting though that it's a human versus an orc.

01:41:44.272 --> 01:41:46.313
[SPEAKER_11]: The movie is also just called Warcraft.

01:41:46.494 --> 01:41:47.915
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not called World of Warcraft.

01:41:48.195 --> 01:41:49.936
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm wondering if they're taking it way back.

01:41:50.356 --> 01:41:54.820
[SPEAKER_11]: They might be taking the story way back to the original humans versus orcs story, which is alright.

01:41:56.144 --> 01:41:57.706
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to all be about Sylvanas and that's it

01:42:17.488 --> 01:42:24.310
[SPEAKER_11]: If you would like to have your voice featured in the game as a Madonkan, you can be in the remake there.

01:42:24.710 --> 01:42:32.973
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to record in a microphone there a few phrases, and you make a SoundCloud account, make sure things sound fine, don't have a lot of feedback in the background or whatever.

01:42:33.553 --> 01:42:38.915
[SPEAKER_11]: It's over on the official blog, oddworld.com, and you have to get those in by Friday, July 26th.

01:42:39.815 --> 01:42:41.335
[SPEAKER_11]: But you could have your voice featured in the game.

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:42.456
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if I should send something in.

01:42:42.496 --> 01:42:43.256
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that might be fun.

01:42:43.636 --> 01:42:45.136
[SPEAKER_11]: I could use the recording equipment here.

01:42:45.896 --> 01:42:48.737
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to say such things as, wait, I'm pulling up the blog here.

01:42:49.117 --> 01:42:52.858
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the, like, it was very simple stuff.

01:42:52.898 --> 01:42:56.539
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of it was like, ow, og, you know, things like that.

01:42:57.739 --> 01:42:59.960
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, which of course now it's not coming up.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:03.601
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyhow, let me try one more time.

01:43:03.841 --> 01:43:05.261
[SPEAKER_11]: This link here might show it.

01:43:07.731 --> 01:43:08.871
[SPEAKER_11]: Live radio, of course.

01:43:08.911 --> 01:43:09.311
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

01:43:10.672 --> 01:43:24.194
[SPEAKER_11]: The words to say are hello, okay, laughing, giggling, angry, hissing, pain grunts, death screams, and bonus points for providing some sound effects for the wildlife of Mudos, birds, scarabs, elumes, etc.

01:43:26.134 --> 01:43:31.635
[SPEAKER_11]: Just get on the microphone and make strange noises because somebody's going to have to listen to it.

01:43:34.596 --> 01:43:35.716
[SPEAKER_11]: Is your mic not on, DarkSakura?

01:43:35.756 --> 01:43:36.916
[SPEAKER_11]: The chat room's bitching.

01:43:38.638 --> 01:43:39.279
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you were muted.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.742
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn it, Rob!

01:43:40.862 --> 01:43:43.306
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

01:43:43.326 --> 01:43:44.388
[SPEAKER_11]: That's totally my bad.

01:43:44.408 --> 01:43:45.109
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

01:43:45.329 --> 01:43:46.331
[SPEAKER_07]: That was not awesome.

01:43:46.351 --> 01:43:47.233
[SPEAKER_07]: That was lame!

01:43:48.362 --> 01:43:50.484
[SPEAKER_11]: Boy, we're all sorts of broken here at OLR tonight.

01:43:50.504 --> 01:43:50.924
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.

01:43:51.965 --> 01:43:55.929
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, okay, DarkSakura, I have a new story to make it all better, okay?

01:43:56.069 --> 01:43:56.470
[SPEAKER_11]: It better.

01:43:56.670 --> 01:43:57.731
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so here's the deal.

01:43:58.151 --> 01:44:02.415
[SPEAKER_11]: Capcom working on what they're calling a major IP for the Nintendo 3DS.

01:44:02.495 --> 01:44:04.077
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Geist Crusher.

01:44:04.517 --> 01:44:09.622
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a multiplayer game where you're going to fight monsters known as Geists, or G-A-I-S-T-S, Geists.

01:44:10.243 --> 01:44:10.923
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing, though.

01:44:10.963 --> 01:44:13.005
[SPEAKER_11]: Geist Crusher, co-developed by Treasure.

01:44:13.826 --> 01:44:25.055
[SPEAKER_11]: so there you go the announcements on Treasure's website treasure-inc.co.jp so Capcom and Treasure are coming together for this so did that make it a little better?

01:44:26.256 --> 01:44:41.929
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be a little tingly alright then why don't you do some news with your now newly on mic yeah thanks Rob well in other news it's actually not pulling up great oh yeah Valve

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:45.220
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they will not give us a Half-Life 3 yet.

01:44:47.641 --> 01:44:49.221
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they don't love you.

01:44:50.821 --> 01:44:51.902
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they don't love somebody.

01:44:54.562 --> 01:45:02.163
[SPEAKER_07]: So, they are actually working with the modding community.

01:45:02.703 --> 01:45:09.405
[SPEAKER_07]: So, they're basically... Come on, thing.

01:45:09.465 --> 01:45:11.805
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, it's my iPad being stupid.

01:45:12.791 --> 01:45:23.836
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, they are doing the Half-Life campaign as a co-op, and it's going to be put on for free, and it's going to be available through Steam.

01:45:24.897 --> 01:45:26.858
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is at least something new, right?

01:45:27.858 --> 01:45:31.140
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the Sven co-op as a standalone game.

01:45:33.726 --> 01:45:50.050
[SPEAKER_07]: and other news, this makes me super happy there's an Adventure Time game it's actually going to be out in the fall on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U and 3DS and it's called Adventure Time, explore the dungeon because I don't know

01:45:52.381 --> 01:45:54.003
[SPEAKER_07]: Stan Lee Howard the Duck

01:46:11.903 --> 01:46:12.784
[SPEAKER_07]: and Squirrel Girl.

01:46:13.384 --> 01:46:19.047
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Squirrel Girl because she kicked the crap out of Thanos and Doctor Doom and did it legit through the power of squirrels.

01:46:20.488 --> 01:46:23.230
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, also included there's Doctor Doom, Jean Grey.

01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:25.191
[SPEAKER_11]: What exactly is the power of squirrels?

01:46:25.652 --> 01:46:26.532
[SPEAKER_07]: She talks to squirrels.

01:46:26.712 --> 01:46:28.013
[SPEAKER_07]: Her power is control of squirrels.

01:46:28.633 --> 01:46:34.357
[SPEAKER_07]: And she can speak squirrel language and she also has sharp teeth and little claws and a big bushy tail and she can climb up trees.

01:46:35.959 --> 01:46:37.820
[SPEAKER_07]: She also can kick anybody's ass.

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:40.020
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Squirrel Girl cannot be defeated by anybody.

01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:42.181
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's also Jessica Jones' nanny.

01:46:42.801 --> 01:46:43.821
[SPEAKER_07]: So that makes her super cool.

01:46:45.722 --> 01:46:57.886
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, also confirmed as Doctor Doom, Jean Grey, Elektra, Magneto, Silver Samurai, Punisher, Beast, Gambit, Storm, Green Goblin, Juggernaut, Rhino, The Thing, Vulture, Sabretooth, and Invisible Woman.

01:46:58.746 --> 01:47:02.707
[SPEAKER_07]: So we also will have Coulson in the game.

01:47:04.352 --> 01:47:08.195
[SPEAKER_07]: and you have a pre-order exclusive of the Iron Patriot and Deadpool.

01:47:09.657 --> 01:47:10.357
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

01:47:12.579 --> 01:47:17.984
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week, which, oh my gosh, this is one of the most popular ones we've ever asked.

01:47:18.004 --> 01:47:19.285
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many answers this week.

01:47:19.365 --> 01:47:20.006
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what to do.

01:47:20.086 --> 01:47:22.088
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

01:47:28.487 --> 01:47:32.470
[SPEAKER_11]: You take Facebook and Google, you slam them together, you get Foogle.

01:47:32.711 --> 01:47:36.954
[SPEAKER_11]: And we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities every week here on the show.

01:47:37.695 --> 01:47:38.455
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's Foogle.

01:47:39.356 --> 01:47:44.840
[SPEAKER_11]: And I knew the news about Strider was going to make DarkSakura very happy.

01:47:45.141 --> 01:47:47.983
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dan, we talked about that in Part A. I feel all squishy now.

01:47:48.143 --> 01:48:17.531
[SPEAKER_11]: so I wanted to ask a similar question of the listeners tonight with a Google question of the week and that is what long dormant series would you like to see make a comeback and I said listeners you only get to pick one to try and keep the answers a little bit short tonight there are alone like 23 answers on Facebook should I read them all that's a lot do it I'm going to read them all quickly I'm only going to read like little bits and pieces if I don't read the entire answer I'm sorry you'll just have to go read them for yourself facebook.com slash orange launch radio or google plus community

01:48:17.731 --> 01:48:18.111
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

01:48:18.371 --> 01:48:18.552
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

01:48:18.772 --> 01:48:19.512
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not really sorry.

01:48:19.712 --> 01:48:20.573
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:48:20.613 --> 01:48:23.034
[SPEAKER_11]: VxChaseNyxV says, Bust a groove.

01:48:23.695 --> 01:48:27.937
[SPEAKER_11]: But this also means it would probably end up a Kinect Move or Wiimote dancing game.

01:48:27.957 --> 01:48:28.898
[SPEAKER_08]: Bust a move.

01:48:29.218 --> 01:48:29.658
[SPEAKER_08]: Move.

01:48:30.119 --> 01:48:32.220
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it depends what country.

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.001
[SPEAKER_11]: UnfoldedRaptor says, A new Gex game.

01:48:35.362 --> 01:48:37.823
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if it's not Gex 4, just a really nice reboot.

01:48:38.724 --> 01:48:39.324
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that'd be fun.

01:48:39.984 --> 01:48:45.648
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob himself says, A remake of California games because he played that to death on the Sega Master System along with Strider.

01:48:47.671 --> 01:49:04.149
[SPEAKER_11]: James S says I want a new entry to the Soul Blazer saga but I'd settle for a remastered Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia Terra Enigma trilogy for my 3DS that is a fucking great answer I'll have you know I would love that too Jeremy J our buddy from Koopa Club says Mega Man

01:49:05.273 --> 01:49:21.891
[SPEAKER_11]: see here's the thing with Mega Man though is that although Capcom has been real they've just been dicks about it to an extent like at least there was Mega Man 9 and 10 and those weren't that long ago all things considered and the Mega Man and Smash Brothers thing now I

01:49:22.111 --> 01:49:36.445
[SPEAKER_11]: I admit, I as much as the next person would like to see a new, you know, 3D Mega Man Legends or just like a Mega Man 11 in the 2-bit style or, you know, kind of like a 2.5D kind of Mega Man game I think would be awesome, especially maybe on like the Wii U or something, but I don't know.

01:49:37.005 --> 01:49:46.274
[SPEAKER_11]: Mega Man's not as, it hasn't been as horribly long for Mega Man yet as some other games I can think of like on the Nintendo and so forth, but.

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:47.740
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.141
[SPEAKER_13]: The Guardian Legend.

01:49:49.161 --> 01:49:50.921
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously?

01:49:51.121 --> 01:49:56.043
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anybody answered Guardian Legend to which I say All of these people are wrong.

01:49:56.103 --> 01:49:58.443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unfortunate that all of our listeners had to be wrong tonight.

01:50:00.484 --> 01:50:03.145
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaming Nerd said a new Alex Kidd game.

01:50:03.465 --> 01:50:07.086
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been featured in Sega Collections but never a new game or a remake of his own.

01:50:07.426 --> 01:50:09.206
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be nice to see Alex Kidd come back, wouldn't it?

01:50:10.146 --> 01:50:15.488
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Rama S says one of the most underrated and underappreciated fighting games, Rival Schools.

01:50:16.536 --> 01:50:17.496
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I love rival schools.

01:50:17.576 --> 01:50:18.957
[SPEAKER_11]: Zether says, Gradius.

01:50:19.137 --> 01:50:21.157
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami's kept it locked up for far too long.

01:50:21.737 --> 01:50:23.538
[SPEAKER_07]: But didn't we have Gradius 5 just a few years ago?

01:50:24.598 --> 01:50:26.179
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it really that, not that long ago?

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:27.239
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was that long ago.

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:31.340
[SPEAKER_11]: William Murderface says, A sequel to Darkwatch.

01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:33.581
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be Halo, but with vampire cowboys.

01:50:34.421 --> 01:50:34.941
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be cool.

01:50:36.062 --> 01:50:39.403
[SPEAKER_11]: Fifth Dream says, I was talking about Section Z and would love to see it make a comeback.

01:50:40.723 --> 01:50:43.544
[SPEAKER_11]: Kareem J says, Streets of Rage 4.

01:50:43.784 --> 01:50:44.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:48.483
[SPEAKER_11]: Loco Poco says, I'd love to see an Illbleed sequel.

01:50:48.544 --> 01:50:50.431
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a great mixture of horror and camp.

01:50:52.192 --> 01:50:54.354
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Nikki E says, Streets of Rage.

01:50:54.474 --> 01:50:56.115
[SPEAKER_11]: I still keep coming back to that game series.

01:50:56.635 --> 01:50:58.317
[SPEAKER_11]: Codeman says, Mega Man Legends.

01:50:59.217 --> 01:51:04.721
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Rich B says, not really a series, but I've always wanted to see a follow-up to Midnight Resistance on the Sega Genesis.

01:51:04.741 --> 01:51:05.862
[SPEAKER_07]: Midnight Resistance is a good game.

01:51:06.162 --> 01:51:06.823
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it'll be.

01:51:07.624 --> 01:51:10.586
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially something kind of like really off the radar like that.

01:51:10.606 --> 01:51:11.466
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they don't ever have like one game.

01:51:11.486 --> 01:51:12.367
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they've done it for Classic.

01:51:12.847 --> 01:51:13.928
[SPEAKER_11]: You probably have at some point.

01:51:14.949 --> 01:51:16.090
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, I mean, you know, they're...

01:51:17.031 --> 01:51:22.316
[SPEAKER_11]: Like he said in the answer, there was never a series there, just one really good game that we want to see something else with.

01:51:23.637 --> 01:51:29.843
[SPEAKER_11]: Ragenator says, Samurai Showdown series, provided that an update stays true to the original five games, 2Ds and Pixels.

01:51:30.123 --> 01:51:34.187
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually said that they were completely closing the series off after five, so I don't think that's happening.

01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:34.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Bastards.

01:51:35.308 --> 01:51:36.229
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll open it back up.

01:51:38.531 --> 01:51:38.952
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

01:51:39.312 --> 01:51:40.954
[SPEAKER_11]: Edgar R. says, a new duck hunt.

01:51:42.352 --> 01:51:43.513
[SPEAKER_11]: This time, the dog dies.

01:51:44.674 --> 01:51:48.118
[SPEAKER_11]: Gamer Girl says, even though this isn't a series, I'd love to see Kid Chameleon.

01:51:48.158 --> 01:51:48.859
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that game.

01:51:49.279 --> 01:51:49.760
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good pick.

01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:52.162
[SPEAKER_11]: Chiggers says, Altered Beast.

01:51:53.123 --> 01:51:54.885
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, make it better this time, too.

01:51:55.746 --> 01:51:57.848
[SPEAKER_11]: K&IM says, Secret of Evermore.

01:51:58.269 --> 01:52:02.013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be happy if they released it again on anything, but Square doesn't want my money, evidently.

01:52:02.313 --> 01:52:09.003
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Secret of Evermore kind of gets crapped on because it was the Square USA title and it wasn't really part of the second Detsetsu series.

01:52:09.023 --> 01:52:12.167
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like a spinoff, but Secret of Evermore had some neat stuff about it.

01:52:12.448 --> 01:52:18.356
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know that that was one of the first soundtracks that, what's his name, Jeremy Soule, that guy that does the soundtracks for Elder Scrolls and stuff?

01:52:18.918 --> 01:52:20.199
[SPEAKER_11]: He did the soundtrack for Secret of Evermore.

01:52:20.219 --> 01:52:21.219
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of his first games ever.

01:52:21.259 --> 01:52:22.520
[SPEAKER_11]: He was probably like 19 when he did it.

01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.300
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that game?

01:52:24.421 --> 01:52:31.304
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Secret of Evermore was really shit on when it first came out, but I think Time has treated it well.

01:52:31.925 --> 01:52:35.046
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't as bad as everybody made it out to be at the time.

01:52:35.126 --> 01:52:40.389
[SPEAKER_11]: It just wasn't a Seiken Detsetsu game, really, even though they kind of tried to make it one.

01:52:41.409 --> 01:52:46.013
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Peker Uno says, it would have to be the platform that got me into gaming in the first place.

01:52:46.093 --> 01:52:48.916
[SPEAKER_11]: Commander Keen would have to be 2D though.

01:52:49.977 --> 01:52:56.503
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, DarkTetsuya says, with the resurrection and Capcom Arcade cabinet, how about a sequel or something to Black Dragon slash Black Tiger?

01:52:57.023 --> 01:53:00.566
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say Magic Sword was a sequel to it, but there hasn't been another one since that.

01:53:00.947 --> 01:53:02.688
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they could implement Oculus Rift support.

01:53:02.988 --> 01:53:03.349
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha ha.

01:53:05.010 --> 01:53:06.710
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim Tripp says, Free Space?

01:53:07.331 --> 01:53:10.232
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd just like to see the return of the epic space combat genre.

01:53:11.672 --> 01:53:13.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Anomalous Underdog says, Vagrant Story.

01:53:14.053 --> 01:53:15.194
[SPEAKER_11]: I even thought of a name for it.

01:53:15.354 --> 01:53:16.094
[SPEAKER_11]: Vagrant Army.

01:53:16.594 --> 01:53:19.215
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we used to call that Fragrant Story because it stinks.

01:53:20.216 --> 01:53:22.837
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know it's not bad, but that was the joke at my house.

01:53:23.326 --> 01:53:24.527
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt says, really?

01:53:24.587 --> 01:53:26.548
[SPEAKER_11]: No one's going to say Chrono Trigger or Chrono Cross?

01:53:26.588 --> 01:53:27.389
[SPEAKER_11]: It's long overdue.

01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:38.936
[SPEAKER_11]: Slidekick says, with the upcoming release of DuckTales Remastered, I'd love to see the return of more of Capcom's classic Disney platformers, like a modern tale on the adventures in the Magic Kingdom.

01:53:39.296 --> 01:53:44.199
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fun blend of different games with a flawless Disney theme, and I think a new version would even be more immersive.

01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:49.783
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as it was more like Nintendo Land and not so much like Kinect Disneyland Adventures, which was sadly a big flop.

01:53:50.163 --> 01:53:54.685
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the thing, though, is that Connect Disneyland Adventures kind of was Adventures in the Magic Kingdom.

01:53:55.085 --> 01:53:58.426
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they really were the same type of thing.

01:53:58.486 --> 01:54:01.667
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that Magic Kingdom was out when you were a kid.

01:54:02.247 --> 01:54:06.589
[SPEAKER_11]: So it held up a little better than Connect Disneyland Adventures did, I think.

01:54:08.049 --> 01:54:11.691
[SPEAKER_11]: and lastly on Facebook Shane says Rising Zan.

01:54:11.951 --> 01:54:17.994
[SPEAKER_11]: It will leave you with a theme and I'll leave you with a theme song because that should be enough to spike some second hand sales of the game.

01:54:18.354 --> 01:54:19.515
[SPEAKER_11]: How can anyone not love this?

01:54:19.595 --> 01:54:20.775
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a ninja cowboy.

01:54:23.197 --> 01:54:24.337
[SPEAKER_07]: Rising Zan was a fun game.

01:54:24.617 --> 01:54:29.300
[SPEAKER_06]: And came back home with the heart of a gunman and the soul of a samurai.

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:30.280
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me skip ahead a bit.

01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:34.202
[SPEAKER_06]: His name would learn the Shogun way of life.

01:54:34.262 --> 01:54:35.743
[SPEAKER_09]: The blue eyes of the sun.

01:54:37.887 --> 01:54:38.307
[SPEAKER_11]: Bizz Pokemon Snap

01:54:54.727 --> 01:54:56.608
[SPEAKER_11]: Travis H says Shining Force.

01:54:57.349 --> 01:54:58.349
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, this is a good answer.

01:54:58.689 --> 01:55:00.370
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft says Uniracers.

01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:01.731
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was awesome.

01:55:01.751 --> 01:55:02.292
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord, no.

01:55:02.492 --> 01:55:02.732
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

01:55:03.252 --> 01:55:04.453
[SPEAKER_01]: That game pissed me off so much.

01:55:04.473 --> 01:55:04.933
[SPEAKER_11]: Get out.

01:55:05.514 --> 01:55:06.534
[SPEAKER_11]: I was so good at that game.

01:55:06.874 --> 01:55:08.215
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what was kind of a sequel?

01:55:08.515 --> 01:55:10.497
[SPEAKER_11]: Uniracers was Excite Truck in a way.

01:55:10.677 --> 01:55:13.578
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the same type of thing with the stunts and everything and midair and all that.

01:55:13.779 --> 01:55:14.239
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit.

01:55:14.359 --> 01:55:14.759
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit.

01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:16.000
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:55:16.826 --> 01:55:21.667
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of great answers, you guys, except you all failed for not mentioning the Guardian legend.

01:55:21.747 --> 01:55:22.087
[SPEAKER_11]: Get out.

01:55:22.327 --> 01:55:27.708
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, though, the Uniracer unicycle should come back as a Smash Bros.

01:55:27.788 --> 01:55:28.548
[SPEAKER_12]: fighting character.

01:55:28.648 --> 01:55:28.948
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:55:29.828 --> 01:55:30.688
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be pretty sweet.

01:55:30.748 --> 01:55:32.249
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be awesome.

01:55:32.269 --> 01:55:35.909
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I suppose if Sega can have Daytona cars fighting, then we can have a fighting unicycle.

01:55:35.949 --> 01:55:36.449
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

01:55:37.290 --> 01:55:42.030
[SPEAKER_11]: Or at least as like a power-up or something, like Princess Peach can ride the unicycle around and do tricks or something.

01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:42.330
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:55:43.111 --> 01:55:43.431
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:55:43.671 --> 01:55:44.691
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get back into some more news.

01:55:44.771 --> 01:55:45.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

01:55:45.931 --> 01:55:47.332
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:55:48.173 --> 01:55:52.357
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're doing this really interesting promotion, I guess.

01:55:52.817 --> 01:55:56.000
[SPEAKER_12]: It's OUYA's $1 million Free the Games Fund.

01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:01.005
[SPEAKER_12]: They're boosting Kickstarter games, or Kickstarted games, I guess.

01:56:01.505 --> 01:56:03.347
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's going to happen is, I guess, between...

01:56:03.727 --> 01:56:07.470
[SPEAKER_12]: August 9th and August 10th next year.

01:56:09.092 --> 01:56:15.116
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess a game will qualify as long as it's achieved its minimum goal of $50,000.

01:56:15.917 --> 01:56:20.120
[SPEAKER_12]: And Ouya will match the total raised up to $250,000.

01:56:20.201 --> 01:56:30.489
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm guessing this is going to be quite limited if you're going to only have a million dollars to shuffle around and

01:56:32.267 --> 01:56:34.849
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to pledge up to $250,000.

01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:50.319
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I guess the game will receive an additional $100,000 if it's one of the most successful Kickstarter projects to take part in the Free the Games program.

01:56:51.460 --> 01:57:02.007
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that the trick with that, there is a big but, you need to have your game exclusive for the OUYA for six months.

01:57:03.529 --> 01:57:07.477
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's the only drawback, I guess.

01:57:07.517 --> 01:57:08.319
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cheating.

01:57:10.783 --> 01:57:12.086
[SPEAKER_12]: But hey, free money, right?

01:57:12.747 --> 01:57:13.188
[SPEAKER_12]: Money's good.

01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.710
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:57:15.970 --> 01:57:17.210
[SPEAKER_11]: Money is always good, of course.

01:57:18.391 --> 01:57:22.071
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't they have to fix some of these other problems, like their customer service and so forth first?

01:57:22.131 --> 01:57:23.352
[SPEAKER_12]: God, that's what I suggested.

01:57:23.392 --> 01:57:27.552
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, hey, you know, the problem is that you don't have enough games on the system.

01:57:27.832 --> 01:57:29.833
[SPEAKER_12]: Although more would be good.

01:57:30.353 --> 01:57:33.394
[SPEAKER_12]: More would be good, but I don't think you're going to get... I mean, look at this.

01:57:34.794 --> 01:57:40.415
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that games have budgets and stuff like that, and they can be quite expensive, especially if you have a team of people, but...

01:57:42.170 --> 01:57:42.470
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:47.455
[SPEAKER_12]: For an indie game, I would think $100,000 is quite a bit.

01:57:47.835 --> 01:57:50.378
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially if you're talking a small team of people.

01:57:51.796 --> 01:57:55.039
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a lot of money, I think.

01:57:55.099 --> 01:58:04.407
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say if we're going to take the high end here, $250,000, so a total of half a million dollars for a game.

01:58:04.667 --> 01:58:06.088
[SPEAKER_12]: That's quite a bit.

01:58:06.949 --> 01:58:08.410
[SPEAKER_12]: It better be one hell of a good game.

01:58:09.151 --> 01:58:15.096
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some pretty decent games on there right now, but I don't think any of them cost half a million dollars or even $100,000 to make.

01:58:18.976 --> 01:58:26.000
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, moving on to a little quote about a spinoff for a very well-received game from this year.

01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:28.081
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to do with the Tomb Raider series.

01:58:28.621 --> 01:58:31.243
[SPEAKER_11]: And Gail Simone, who is a comic book veteran.

01:58:31.263 --> 01:58:32.724
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, no, she is awesome.

01:58:33.164 --> 01:58:33.384
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah?

01:58:33.944 --> 01:58:35.005
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of other stuff has she done?

01:58:35.045 --> 01:58:35.785
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't follow comics.

01:58:35.805 --> 01:58:39.267
[SPEAKER_07]: She's one of the only reasons I ever read anything DC on purpose.

01:58:39.747 --> 01:58:43.309
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she did, what did she do?

01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.490
[SPEAKER_07]: Birds of Prey.

01:58:45.491 --> 01:58:47.653
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, even I know what that is because that was a CW show.

01:58:49.275 --> 01:58:54.559
[SPEAKER_07]: But she is probably one of the best female comic book writers out there.

01:58:54.919 --> 01:58:55.179
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:59.623
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, she's teaming up with publisher Dark Horse to work on a Tomb Raider comic.

01:58:59.883 --> 01:59:02.225
[SPEAKER_11]: But what caught people's attention was this quote.

01:59:02.265 --> 01:59:08.210
[SPEAKER_11]: She said, quote, In continuity, it will be a Tomb Raider canon and lead directly into the sequel.

01:59:08.711 --> 01:59:09.992
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what got me excited.

01:59:10.412 --> 01:59:12.414
[SPEAKER_11]: We get to be part of Lara Croft history.

01:59:12.874 --> 01:59:13.135
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

01:59:13.755 --> 01:59:19.301
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't announced a sequel to Tomb Raider, so this quote kind of grabbed people's attention.

01:59:19.722 --> 01:59:23.066
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I mean, let's be real, it would make a lot of sense.

01:59:23.526 --> 01:59:24.908
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you didn't expect a sequel.

01:59:24.928 --> 01:59:25.529
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, right?

01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:26.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the game was well received.

01:59:26.530 --> 01:59:27.451
[SPEAKER_11]: It did perform under...

01:59:28.692 --> 01:59:32.554
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, but we all kind of looked at that quote in the beginning and kind of went, really?

01:59:33.014 --> 01:59:33.594
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

01:59:33.714 --> 01:59:34.434
[SPEAKER_11]: With that quote?

01:59:34.454 --> 01:59:36.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Are people just pulling this way out of context?

01:59:37.515 --> 01:59:39.096
[SPEAKER_12]: A, why not A plus?

01:59:40.777 --> 01:59:41.457
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, right?

01:59:41.997 --> 01:59:49.260
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, plus, I would think that if they're going to make a sequel, it's going to likely use a lot of the same components that were in the original.

01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:53.041
[SPEAKER_11]: So like I'm saying, they don't have to necessarily reinvent the wheel with a sequel.

01:59:53.361 --> 01:59:56.042
[SPEAKER_11]: They can carry over a lot of stuff that they did with the first game.

01:59:56.063 --> 01:59:57.103
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, granted, they'd want to do...

01:59:57.523 --> 01:59:59.347
[SPEAKER_11]: Bigger, better, and all that other stuff.

01:59:59.748 --> 02:00:03.295
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we kill her more?

02:00:03.755 --> 02:00:09.006
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would think that you wouldn't necessarily maybe have to put the same financial investment into it.

02:00:10.222 --> 02:00:32.235
[SPEAKER_11]: necessarily so maybe you could still get bang for the buck and maybe make up for this perceived lack although I don't know again I still think it seems like the game's done well and I'm sure it sold a ton of extra copies what was eight bucks on the steam sale this week and I'm sure there were a lot of people that snapped it up for that so I've had a lot of fun playing it so

02:00:33.034 --> 02:00:34.795
[SPEAKER_11]: Some other comments from Gail Simone.

02:00:35.075 --> 02:00:37.076
[SPEAKER_11]: The storytelling in the game hooked me instantly.

02:00:37.396 --> 02:00:41.518
[SPEAKER_11]: The biggest difference is the game told a claustrophobic story in an isolated setting.

02:00:41.818 --> 02:00:43.519
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going globetrotting.

02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:54.285
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe if there is a sequel, if this ties into it, it will be more Laura exploring rather than the whole, you know, escape from, you know, Death Sentence Island.

02:00:54.345 --> 02:00:59.307
[SPEAKER_12]: She'll be seeking the legendary, elusive art thief, Carmen Sandiego.

02:01:01.579 --> 02:01:11.345
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so, anyhow, exciting that, I mean, although I think, you know, a sequel to Good Game is a bit of a duh, it's still exciting to hear that that's in development.

02:01:11.365 --> 02:01:13.827
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of franchise reboot, Carmen Sandiego.

02:01:15.666 --> 02:01:16.286
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard about this.

02:01:16.707 --> 02:01:18.409
[SPEAKER_11]: PBS has been teasing this, right?

02:01:18.930 --> 02:01:20.552
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I was just saying they should do a sequel.

02:01:31.966 --> 02:01:48.847
[SPEAKER_11]: but like I think they're doing something where they're going to play the old game show things again on PBS somebody in chat can help me fill in the gaps I just remember picking up bits and pieces of this on Twitter but like I think they are setting the stages for a Carmen Sandiego comeback so it's funny that you bring that up because like no legitimately there's there's something to that

02:01:49.281 --> 02:01:50.162
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what would be funny?

02:01:52.324 --> 02:01:55.647
[SPEAKER_07]: Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego would have worked in the 80s?

02:01:56.688 --> 02:01:58.610
[SPEAKER_07]: But imagine having that now.

02:01:58.630 --> 02:02:03.775
[SPEAKER_07]: People would be like, well, just can't we do GPS and use CCTV and all this?

02:02:03.995 --> 02:02:05.116
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we found her in five seconds.

02:02:07.078 --> 02:02:07.679
[SPEAKER_07]: Send a drone.

02:02:07.959 --> 02:02:08.620
[SPEAKER_12]: Or more like...

02:02:10.003 --> 02:02:10.683
[SPEAKER_12]: What country?

02:02:11.584 --> 02:02:12.204
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's that?

02:02:12.665 --> 02:02:13.925
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never heard of that country.

02:02:14.005 --> 02:02:14.465
[SPEAKER_12]: China!

02:02:15.646 --> 02:02:16.286
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, stop.

02:02:17.127 --> 02:02:17.467
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:02:18.047 --> 02:02:19.028
[SPEAKER_12]: Drew, that's made up.

02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:22.830
[SPEAKER_11]: You're so ignorant.

02:02:23.210 --> 02:02:24.391
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, DarkSakura, what do you got?

02:02:25.427 --> 02:02:25.888
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff.

02:02:26.728 --> 02:02:27.910
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not Carmen Sandiego.

02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:28.690
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about Atlas.

02:02:29.972 --> 02:02:38.100
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, Nintendo... Well, you know Atlas filed for bankruptcy and everyone's worried about a particular series of theirs, Shin Megami Tensei.

02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:39.501
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Nintendo's buying it.

02:02:40.142 --> 02:02:46.228
[SPEAKER_07]: So we may see a Persona 5 Wii U. Yeah, you made a noise.

02:02:46.328 --> 02:02:46.628
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

02:02:46.888 --> 02:02:47.189
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, no.

02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.949
[SPEAKER_11]: I was laughing at chat.

02:02:48.150 --> 02:02:48.330
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

02:02:49.042 --> 02:02:57.827
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Atlas kind of screwed themselves, but Nintendo seems to be grabbing the hot one.

02:02:58.067 --> 02:03:00.268
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, all the fans, that was what they were worried about.

02:03:00.288 --> 02:03:03.950
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to happen with Persona, with Shin Megami Tensei?

02:03:04.071 --> 02:03:05.952
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like Nintendo's saving the series.

02:03:06.852 --> 02:03:10.114
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought this whole bankruptcy thing wasn't supposed to be this big of a deal.

02:03:10.234 --> 02:03:14.617
[SPEAKER_11]: And now here we're talking Nintendo's snapping up IPs.

02:03:15.718 --> 02:03:18.720
[SPEAKER_11]: How did things go from A to Z like that?

02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:22.843
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they've already been working with Nintendo in this series because remember the crossover with Fire Emblem?

02:03:24.024 --> 02:03:31.949
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like if you have Shin Megami Tensei IV, they had a crossover promotion with Fire Emblem.

02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:35.972
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you had both of them, you'd get like $30 eShop credit in North America.

02:03:37.501 --> 02:04:04.144
[SPEAKER_07]: so that was a big thing but I think that there's a they're developing Shin Megami Tensei cross Fire Emblem for Wii U so I think it's going to be I think it's going to definitely be I would be something can you imagine if Persona 5 was a Wii U exclusive now that's that would be a pretty crazy grab there yeah it would be but it's smart it's a smart move oh yeah

02:04:06.735 --> 02:04:09.916
[SPEAKER_12]: Just real quick off, since we were talking about Carameldansen a second ago.

02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:14.517
[SPEAKER_12]: So I pulled up that article that Ranma linked in chat, and they were talking about different things.

02:04:14.577 --> 02:04:22.060
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the very bottom, of course, it said that Charlene, Teresa, Lynn, Thigpen, the one that was the chief on the show.

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:23.220
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, she passed away.

02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:24.900
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, she passed away in 2003 and stuff.

02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:31.282
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I found a little bit disturbing is on Wikipedia, it actually shows where the resting place is.

02:04:31.462 --> 02:04:33.383
[SPEAKER_12]: It tells you which cemetery she is buried in.

02:04:33.963 --> 02:04:34.163
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

02:04:35.203 --> 02:04:36.664
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of wikis that do that.

02:04:36.684 --> 02:04:38.204
[SPEAKER_11]: Wikipedia has that on a lot of articles.

02:04:38.224 --> 02:04:38.905
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of weird.

02:04:39.225 --> 02:04:40.245
[SPEAKER_11]: No, a lot of articles say that.

02:04:40.505 --> 02:04:42.086
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's this whole other site.

02:04:42.106 --> 02:04:44.366
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a whole site dedicated... Where are they buried, I think?

02:04:44.386 --> 02:04:47.127
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's a whole site dedicated to celebrity tombstones.

02:04:47.147 --> 02:04:49.048
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually... I don't know if I should...

02:04:49.508 --> 02:04:49.828
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

02:04:49.848 --> 02:04:50.709
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, I'm like, no, thank you.

02:04:50.729 --> 02:04:51.329
[SPEAKER_11]: Not my thing, but...

02:05:09.059 --> 02:05:09.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Death Masks

02:05:32.050 --> 02:05:58.179
[SPEAKER_07]: for anyone who doesn't know what those are basically there's a plaster cast made and then they're cast in bronze or sometimes clay or different things but the the death masks are basically the faces at death once they're you know ready to be buried and saved but there's people who still do death masks to this day and there's websites that have all the modern death masks so I'm gonna have one done do Walt Disney have one done I don't think so I plan on having one done though really isn't that expensive

02:05:59.534 --> 02:06:01.875
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know how much plaster and stuff costs.

02:06:02.356 --> 02:06:03.576
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you can't do it yourself.

02:06:03.837 --> 02:06:06.578
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I have, Rob, how many artists do I know?

02:06:06.758 --> 02:06:09.080
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true, that's true.

02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:13.762
[SPEAKER_11]: It costs a lot to join that, what is it called, the Neptune Society or whatever, the people that'll dump you at sea?

02:06:15.503 --> 02:06:20.626
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my funeral is going to be Jewish and easy.

02:06:21.687 --> 02:06:24.789
[SPEAKER_07]: Pine box buried 24 hours later, no embalming.

02:06:25.745 --> 02:06:30.269
[SPEAKER_11]: I've already mentioned I want to be flung out of a cannon at my work building during the lunch hour.

02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:31.170
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I want.

02:06:31.190 --> 02:06:32.791
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually discussed what Dan wanted today.

02:06:33.372 --> 02:06:40.697
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're doing is we're putting him in his 69 Mustang coupe, loading it with explosives, pushing it off a cliff, and blowing it up in midair.

02:06:41.038 --> 02:06:41.338
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

02:06:42.058 --> 02:06:46.042
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Genki style and Roger Corman style.

02:06:47.903 --> 02:06:48.203
[SPEAKER_11]: Fancy.

02:06:48.423 --> 02:06:48.644
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:06:49.284 --> 02:06:51.826
[SPEAKER_07]: I am having a Jewish burial and an Irish wake.

02:06:51.906 --> 02:06:53.167
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you calling us on original?

02:06:54.207 --> 02:06:54.428
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:06:54.468 --> 02:06:56.269
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on, Loki.

02:06:56.689 --> 02:07:01.212
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Harmonix is due some sweet, sweet money.

02:07:02.013 --> 02:07:05.315
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's because Viacom, they lost their appeal.

02:07:05.875 --> 02:07:13.020
[SPEAKER_12]: Which, you know, there was a whole lawsuit, I guess, that they had owed Harmonix some money.

02:07:13.801 --> 02:07:16.262
[SPEAKER_12]: And that includes now $299 million with interest.

02:07:19.604 --> 02:07:21.825
[SPEAKER_12]: So, good for Harmonix.

02:07:21.965 --> 02:07:25.746
[SPEAKER_12]: That should fund some extra tracks in Fantasia, right?

02:07:27.187 --> 02:07:35.990
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess now it says, Harmonix's law firm estimates a payout, including another dispute, I guess the company has, for a total of $533 million.

02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:36.770
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a sweet chunk of change.

02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.970
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

02:07:44.761 --> 02:07:46.302
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

02:08:07.268 --> 02:08:33.450
[SPEAKER_11]: so this isn't just you know virtual console releases they are redone in the 3d i i wouldn't expect a whole lot more i mean that's that's really it like i don't think they're going back and redoing all the graphics or anything like that so don't get your hopes too far up but you will be able to experience 3d altered beast 3d echo the dolphin 3d galaxy force 2 3d shinobi 3 3d sonic the hedgehog 3d space harrier 3d streets of rage and 3d super hang on i've

02:08:33.490 --> 02:08:40.134
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that should look pretty cool considering that some of the 3D converts we've seen so far have been NES titles and now these are like 16-bit.

02:08:40.554 --> 02:08:42.615
[SPEAKER_08]: 3D Space Harrier is going to be sweet.

02:08:43.523 --> 02:08:46.345
[SPEAKER_11]: I... Like, 3D Kid Icarus was really cool.

02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:50.168
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, they didn't change a lot, but it was just... Like, it was very subtle.

02:08:50.308 --> 02:08:55.272
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, they added the backgrounds, very subtle updates that made it really cool.

02:08:55.472 --> 02:08:56.513
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I like that one a lot.

02:08:57.473 --> 02:08:59.995
[SPEAKER_11]: But, like, some of the 3D remakes were a little silly.

02:09:00.035 --> 02:09:02.037
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, 3D Wrecking... No, not Wrecking Crew.

02:09:02.217 --> 02:09:03.218
[SPEAKER_11]: Urban Champion or whatever.

02:09:03.238 --> 02:09:04.459
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a little silly.

02:09:05.079 --> 02:09:08.101
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, it'll be cool to check out a couple of these.

02:09:08.181 --> 02:09:09.802
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about 3D Altered Beast.

02:09:09.842 --> 02:09:10.303
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't...

02:09:10.803 --> 02:09:12.785
[SPEAKER_08]: Wise from your grave.

02:09:13.326 --> 02:09:17.790
[SPEAKER_11]: People remember that epicness from the arcade when they were a kid and stuff, but I played through the game recently.

02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:19.232
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really not that good.

02:09:19.632 --> 02:09:20.953
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really not that good.

02:09:21.754 --> 02:09:25.578
[SPEAKER_11]: But 3D Sonic will be cool, even though it'll be like the 17th time I've played Sonic.

02:09:25.938 --> 02:09:26.919
[SPEAKER_11]: But 3D Space Harrier.

02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:28.221
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm here for that.

02:09:28.401 --> 02:09:29.442
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

02:09:29.582 --> 02:09:30.022
[SPEAKER_07]: Get ready.

02:09:30.683 --> 02:09:31.304
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting ready.

02:09:32.044 --> 02:09:32.865
[SPEAKER_11]: My body is ready.

02:09:33.065 --> 02:09:33.386
[SPEAKER_07]: Your body.

02:09:34.557 --> 02:09:35.778
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you in the fantasy zone, Rob?

02:09:35.838 --> 02:09:36.098
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:09:36.919 --> 02:09:38.360
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, are you in the mailbag zone?

02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:38.900
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have you?

02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:39.601
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we have two.

02:09:39.781 --> 02:09:41.322
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have emails tonight, woohoo!

02:09:41.502 --> 02:09:42.563
[SPEAKER_07]: Two whole emails!

02:09:43.343 --> 02:09:49.888
[SPEAKER_11]: You can email us too, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Well great, I better pay attention because I have no idea what these are about tonight.

02:09:49.908 --> 02:09:50.848
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't get to read them in advance.

02:09:51.069 --> 02:09:53.270
[SPEAKER_07]: Well this comes from Brad, our podculture Brad.

02:09:53.770 --> 02:09:54.711
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi podculture Brad!

02:09:55.231 --> 02:09:59.735
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of part A, you guys said there were not any emails yet, so how about a kitty pic instead?

02:09:59.755 --> 02:10:02.597
[SPEAKER_07]: So they sent us a picture of his kitty patting at the screen.

02:10:03.968 --> 02:10:04.949
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's adorable.

02:10:05.049 --> 02:10:08.572
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Kitty.

02:10:08.833 --> 02:10:10.755
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to get to meet Brad in five weeks.

02:10:10.775 --> 02:10:12.477
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited.

02:10:12.497 --> 02:10:15.700
[SPEAKER_12]: I am super pissed at my cat.

02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:16.421
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

02:10:17.001 --> 02:10:19.764
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she's trying to chew on my 3DS charge cable.

02:10:20.945 --> 02:10:24.029
[SPEAKER_07]: And every time I move it out of her way, she's like, uh-uh, I'm going to get it.

02:10:24.769 --> 02:10:25.070
[SPEAKER_09]: Meow.

02:10:25.848 --> 02:10:27.530
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to buy her a shoestring or something.

02:10:28.051 --> 02:10:28.992
[SPEAKER_07]: I have toys for her.

02:10:29.053 --> 02:10:32.577
[SPEAKER_07]: She plays with all of Shermie's toys because Shermie's too fat and lazy.

02:10:33.098 --> 02:10:34.620
[SPEAKER_07]: Except I won't give her Shermie's mousy.

02:10:35.201 --> 02:10:36.884
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

02:10:36.944 --> 02:10:38.546
[SPEAKER_07]: This house that we're looking at has a cat door in it.

02:10:42.235 --> 02:10:42.715
[SPEAKER_07]: Next email.

02:10:43.355 --> 02:10:44.495
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's Rissimo.

02:10:44.835 --> 02:10:52.437
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't emailed or called in like forever, but just a quick thank you for all your hard work and dedication to your craft and to your fans.

02:10:53.037 --> 02:10:55.558
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been listening since I first heard about you guys on Joystick.

02:10:56.478 --> 02:10:57.178
[SPEAKER_07]: We were on Joystick.

02:10:57.218 --> 02:10:58.218
[SPEAKER_11]: We were on Joystick?

02:10:58.658 --> 02:10:59.759
[SPEAKER_07]: When the hell did that happen?

02:11:01.939 --> 02:11:03.741
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh!

02:11:04.061 --> 02:11:08.784
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they used to do like a weekly podcast thing and I think we were featured once.

02:11:09.424 --> 02:11:17.450
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I remember PlayStation Joystick site did a really nice write-up on olrpsp.com some time ago.

02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:18.350
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really cool.

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:21.673
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to say probably when the whole...

02:11:22.895 --> 02:11:23.155
[SPEAKER_11]: Gagahamster

02:11:39.232 --> 02:11:43.315
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, which by the way, just the Glamster was what we were going to call it.

02:11:43.876 --> 02:11:47.638
[SPEAKER_11]: AkumaJP, bless his heart, did do some research on Glamster.

02:11:48.199 --> 02:11:50.100
[SPEAKER_11]: And they don't have a Twitter, it seems like.

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:51.882
[SPEAKER_11]: But he did get us the website.

02:11:51.982 --> 02:11:54.544
[SPEAKER_11]: It's bergsala-lightweight.co.jp

02:11:56.485 --> 02:11:58.747
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the pretty, pretty princess of hamsters.

02:12:19.048 --> 02:12:27.294
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to bombard their Twitter and try to take another social media campaign like we did with President Cat to its horrendous success.

02:12:27.795 --> 02:12:30.377
[SPEAKER_11]: But no luck.

02:12:30.397 --> 02:12:32.518
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no Twitter to bug them through.

02:12:32.558 --> 02:12:34.880
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll keep trying.

02:12:36.361 --> 02:12:39.364
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you remember the Katamari debacle of yesteryear.

02:12:39.944 --> 02:12:44.828
[SPEAKER_07]: Haven't missed a single episode and felt the need to say thanks for getting me through so many work days.

02:12:45.268 --> 02:12:45.848
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you all.

02:12:45.928 --> 02:12:46.649
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks once again.

02:12:46.789 --> 02:12:47.690
[SPEAKER_07]: Sent from my iPhone.

02:12:49.005 --> 02:12:49.725
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that was very nice.

02:12:49.745 --> 02:12:52.026
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no questions or opinions.

02:12:52.186 --> 02:12:53.506
[SPEAKER_07]: I like nice emails.

02:12:53.666 --> 02:12:54.526
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

02:12:54.766 --> 02:12:56.807
[SPEAKER_11]: That was just a good old-fashioned thank you.

02:12:56.947 --> 02:13:00.007
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially, there was only one missing comma.

02:13:01.268 --> 02:13:02.728
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was quite pleased.

02:13:03.408 --> 02:13:04.368
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and you're welcome.

02:13:04.988 --> 02:13:05.689
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you for that.

02:13:06.729 --> 02:13:09.169
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always really awesome to see things like that.

02:13:09.509 --> 02:13:11.550
[SPEAKER_07]: You get an invisible gold star for awesome.

02:13:14.195 --> 02:13:20.559
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I gotta say, I so appreciate the small gestures people have done to just kind of say thanks for OLR.

02:13:20.619 --> 02:13:27.102
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, Codeman got me Borderlands 2 because I was bitching about wanting it last week and he was kind enough to get that for me.

02:13:27.402 --> 02:13:28.063
[SPEAKER_11]: That means a lot.

02:13:28.503 --> 02:13:33.966
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got a trading card I wanted just because somebody had it and was like, hey, I like OLR.

02:13:34.066 --> 02:13:34.727
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, have this.

02:13:34.787 --> 02:13:35.327
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you need it.

02:13:35.927 --> 02:13:37.488
[SPEAKER_11]: And, like, didn't expect anything in return.

02:13:37.508 --> 02:13:38.749
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, that's all.

02:13:38.809 --> 02:13:42.411
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though those cards are only like 18 cents, still, it's just like the gesture is like, oh my god.

02:13:42.952 --> 02:13:44.714
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually the small gestures I get are lewd.

02:13:50.042 --> 02:13:51.745
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a wiener for you, DarkSakura.

02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:57.434
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Slidekick found our article.

02:13:58.806 --> 02:14:02.548
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:14:29.813 --> 02:14:30.793
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an old article.

02:14:31.073 --> 02:14:35.474
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll tell you what, probably updated it the last time they ran that article.

02:14:35.674 --> 02:14:37.135
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the last time you updated it?

02:14:37.155 --> 02:14:37.835
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:14:38.455 --> 02:14:51.898
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, actually, I'm getting the emails from GoDaddy to renew OrangeLoungeRadio.com, which obviously that'll happen, even though we really need to do something with that website to modernize it a little bit and get it away from the hackers.

02:14:52.298 --> 02:14:56.939
[SPEAKER_11]: But OLRPSP.com is up for renewal, and I'm questioning if I should renew it.

02:14:57.159 --> 02:14:57.559
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not.

02:14:59.099 --> 02:15:03.181
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of feel like there's people that'll be pissed off if I let it go.

02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:03.881
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, hold on.

02:15:04.901 --> 02:15:06.922
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a Facebook comment the other day.

02:15:06.942 --> 02:15:11.003
[SPEAKER_12]: You can still access it by going to orangelaunchradio.com slash PSP.

02:15:11.624 --> 02:15:12.024
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

02:15:12.184 --> 02:15:16.505
[SPEAKER_11]: So... All right, then I feel better letting it go if that's going to be the case.

02:15:16.606 --> 02:15:18.606
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because in fact, I'll still check this real quick.

02:15:18.626 --> 02:15:20.207
[SPEAKER_07]: You have such a cute kitty, Brad.

02:15:21.467 --> 02:15:23.788
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's slash PSP.

02:15:23.848 --> 02:15:24.729
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that actually...

02:15:27.017 --> 02:15:45.197
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yeah, see, if you do orangeonstreet.com slash PSP Okay, well that's cool, then yeah, I might let olrpsp.com lapse, if there's still a way to get to it Alright A lot of these pages don't work anymore Ranma, secret message, send me some I will Alright

02:15:47.266 --> 02:15:50.450
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw says, why not change OLR PSP to a mobile site?

02:15:51.431 --> 02:15:51.931
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh, no.

02:15:52.652 --> 02:15:54.293
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I kind of feel the same.

02:15:54.353 --> 02:15:56.275
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, that's a lot of work to maintain.

02:15:56.315 --> 02:16:00.339
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a lot of the focus right now is also on building VOG Network.

02:16:00.399 --> 02:16:02.601
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like the central hub and making that bigger and better.

02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:03.802
[SPEAKER_12]: Network's okay on mobile.

02:16:04.123 --> 02:16:09.208
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and that, you know, I think the next step at some point for VOG will be a mobile app.

02:16:09.608 --> 02:16:10.869
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's, you know...

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:12.650
[SPEAKER_11]: in the future.

02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:13.750
[SPEAKER_11]: Ways away.

02:16:14.031 --> 02:16:15.551
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get excited about that.

02:16:15.791 --> 02:16:16.471
[SPEAKER_11]: Long ways out.

02:16:17.311 --> 02:16:23.153
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll probably see it'll come out around the time Zelda's finally out on Wii U. All right.

02:16:24.593 --> 02:16:24.933
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

02:16:26.834 --> 02:16:27.694
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it for emails, right?

02:16:28.714 --> 02:16:29.134
[SPEAKER_08]: Yar.

02:16:29.274 --> 02:16:32.515
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

02:16:33.055 --> 02:16:36.996
[SPEAKER_11]: That means it's the time in the show when we do the F use of the week.

02:16:53.672 --> 02:16:54.392
[SPEAKER_07]: My F.U.

02:16:55.353 --> 02:16:57.473
[SPEAKER_07]: goes to this cough that will not go away.

02:16:58.194 --> 02:17:00.455
[SPEAKER_07]: The conditions of some of the houses we've seen.

02:17:00.815 --> 02:17:03.736
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there were like burnt carpet and cat pee smells.

02:17:04.636 --> 02:17:07.057
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of these people, like the HUD houses, oh my god, it's so bad.

02:17:07.497 --> 02:17:08.478
[SPEAKER_07]: And then another F.U.

02:17:08.498 --> 02:17:10.298
[SPEAKER_07]: just to the housing industry in general.

02:17:10.858 --> 02:17:13.940
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's really like this weird...

02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:17.681
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll keep my fingers and my toes crossed.

02:17:17.821 --> 02:17:17.901
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

02:17:41.553 --> 02:17:44.796
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, just fuck you, yeah, because I still don't have a fixed controller yet.

02:17:44.916 --> 02:17:52.765
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though it sort of seems like it's going on the right track, I thought the same thing back on July 1st, and look where we are now.

02:17:53.266 --> 02:17:53.987
[SPEAKER_12]: So, fuck them.

02:17:56.226 --> 02:17:56.486
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it?

02:17:56.506 --> 02:17:56.927
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

02:17:57.948 --> 02:18:10.519
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU goes to the fact that I can't follow through things on certain things that I say I'm going to do and convince myself that I'm going to do, but then I'm just like, but you can't really do that, even though you probably should.

02:18:10.779 --> 02:18:11.580
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the gym, Rob.

02:18:12.273 --> 02:18:13.955
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:18:35.003 --> 02:18:35.303
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:18:35.444 --> 02:18:44.012
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, back to a couple more news stories in the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:44.973 --> 02:18:51.520
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I guess Namco is prepping a HD version of Soul Calibur 2.

02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:56.765
[SPEAKER_12]: Soul Calibur 2 HD Online coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this fall.

02:18:57.265 --> 02:19:05.808
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming as a download title because I haven't seen anything on here that says that it's going to be released at retail.

02:19:06.668 --> 02:19:08.709
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I haven't heard of anything yet about retail.

02:19:09.449 --> 02:19:15.952
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, apparently the game is going to be closer to HD now.

02:19:15.972 --> 02:19:16.932
[SPEAKER_12]: The outputting at 720p.

02:19:16.972 --> 02:19:17.312
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

02:19:23.191 --> 02:19:23.411
[SPEAKER_12]: Neat.

02:19:23.811 --> 02:19:26.172
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming that the special characters aren't going to be in the game.

02:19:26.192 --> 02:19:31.273
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, because you probably can't get spawn or, you know, obviously Link's not going to be back because he was only on GameCube.

02:19:31.893 --> 02:19:33.553
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Heihachi?

02:19:34.513 --> 02:19:34.713
Yeah.

02:19:36.174 --> 02:19:36.874
[SPEAKER_12]: So no Link.

02:19:36.914 --> 02:19:38.894
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, because that was GameCube.

02:19:38.914 --> 02:19:39.895
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, yeah.

02:19:40.835 --> 02:19:41.855
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know.

02:19:44.736 --> 02:19:46.416
[SPEAKER_12]: It's bad it's not coming to Wii U.

02:19:47.927 --> 02:19:49.428
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

02:19:49.809 --> 02:19:50.369
[SPEAKER_11]: But you never know.

02:19:50.409 --> 02:19:52.931
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you never know, but... Yeah, we're kind of not getting my hopes up.

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:54.092
[SPEAKER_11]: This Wii doesn't run games, I guess.

02:19:55.353 --> 02:19:56.013
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it does.

02:19:56.073 --> 02:19:56.554
[SPEAKER_11]: Be quiet.

02:19:57.074 --> 02:19:57.795
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop trolling.

02:19:58.896 --> 02:20:01.918
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, one more news story for you guys before we open up the Skype line.

02:20:01.978 --> 02:20:03.920
[SPEAKER_11]: And I gotta say, this is a really...

02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:05.360
[SPEAKER_11]: All You Can Arcade

02:20:20.683 --> 02:20:21.264
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:20:36.923 --> 02:20:37.624
[SPEAKER_11]: brought to you.

02:20:38.245 --> 02:20:41.288
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can swap them out for a different one in stock or whatever.

02:20:41.409 --> 02:20:45.674
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, it's only in certain areas because they bring the games to you, which is pretty amazing.

02:20:46.034 --> 02:20:51.260
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only available in the San Francisco Bay Area, Stockton, San Jose, Santa Rosa, and Sacramento.

02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:52.402
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Sacramento has it.

02:20:54.103 --> 02:20:54.623
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

02:21:23.122 --> 02:21:38.673
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is crazy, I mean it's very ambitious I should probably share that with Dan's Pinball Group Yeah, I mean I didn't see if there were actually But yeah, some of the cabinets they have on here, I mean most of them are old stuff But still, you know, Bad Dudes, Ms.

02:21:38.733 --> 02:21:47.600
[SPEAKER_11]: Pac-Man, I'm looking at the site Which we're totally just giving them free advertising here But whatever, it's a neat idea And it's really taking the Netflix thing to the next level, isn't it?

02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:49.141
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the totally fake picture though

02:21:49.733 --> 02:21:51.956
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, these little gals playing the game and having fun.

02:21:51.976 --> 02:21:53.277
[SPEAKER_07]: And the little black dresses and heels.

02:21:53.417 --> 02:21:54.679
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, versus Goonies.

02:21:54.739 --> 02:21:55.460
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:56.060
[SPEAKER_11]: I want that.

02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:56.481
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

02:21:57.461 --> 02:21:58.902
[SPEAKER_12]: Where can you view what they have?

02:21:59.462 --> 02:22:01.503
[SPEAKER_11]: Allyoucanarcade.com Yeah, I went there.

02:22:02.143 --> 02:22:03.464
[SPEAKER_12]: Signing up.

02:22:03.664 --> 02:22:05.905
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can actually browse games available in my area.

02:22:05.945 --> 02:22:06.266
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

[SPEAKER_11]: Where?

02:22:07.006 --> 02:22:07.926
[SPEAKER_11]: I put in my zip code here.

02:22:08.026 --> 02:22:09.007
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in the upper right corner.

02:22:10.188 --> 02:22:15.150
[SPEAKER_11]: Bad Dudes, Berserk, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Golden Tee.

02:22:15.790 --> 02:22:16.611
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't all of them.

02:22:16.651 --> 02:22:18.172
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just looking at... Heavy Barrel's a good one.

02:22:18.952 --> 02:22:19.192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

02:22:19.212 --> 02:22:19.612
[SPEAKER_08]: Silkworm.

02:22:20.093 --> 02:22:20.333
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:22:20.793 --> 02:22:23.334
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.

02:22:23.654 --> 02:22:24.375
[SPEAKER_11]: Get out, really?

02:22:24.575 --> 02:22:25.075
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

02:22:26.276 --> 02:22:26.516
I didn't...

02:22:28.195 --> 02:22:30.556
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, there is a DDR machine.

02:22:30.576 --> 02:22:32.377
[SPEAKER_11]: But you were just looking at area.

02:22:33.197 --> 02:22:34.638
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I was looking at area.

02:22:34.658 --> 02:22:35.478
[SPEAKER_08]: This is looking at Sacramento.

02:22:36.098 --> 02:22:38.279
[SPEAKER_11]: It might not be available in your area necessarily.

02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:42.261
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, that's the type of game they're willing to rent.

02:22:42.381 --> 02:22:43.482
[SPEAKER_11]: One might show up, Loki.

02:22:43.942 --> 02:22:45.162
[SPEAKER_07]: They need a 2DX on that list.

02:22:45.462 --> 02:22:45.883
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh boy.

02:22:45.903 --> 02:22:46.803
[SPEAKER_08]: I will rent it forever.

02:22:48.892 --> 02:22:49.212
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:22:49.612 --> 02:22:58.318
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I may have to hog that if I actually... Hey, if the idea does well and I just totally gave them free advertising... Dude, I would totally just want to buy that.

02:22:58.598 --> 02:22:59.318
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of neat.

02:23:00.099 --> 02:23:01.820
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, there you go.

02:23:01.980 --> 02:23:02.380
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

02:23:02.681 --> 02:23:04.482
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it for the stories we had on deck tonight.

02:23:04.522 --> 02:23:06.663
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to open up our Skype line if you want to give us a call.

02:23:06.683 --> 02:23:10.586
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:23:10.606 --> 02:23:14.429
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's something you want to talk about tonight that we haven't brought up, we'll get to Twitter topics in a minute here.

02:23:14.489 --> 02:23:16.150
[SPEAKER_11]: But first, some last-minute stories.

02:23:16.450 --> 02:23:18.131
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, I think you said you had one tonight, right?

02:23:18.331 --> 02:23:45.558
[SPEAKER_07]: I do and I seriously thought I'd put it in my stories and I didn't so this goes out to all the homestucks basically Hussie shut up basically Hussie is going to be working with Namco doing a dating sim the game is called Namco High and it is a fictional crossover high school that all the Namco characters are going to so it's yeah date high school sim and

02:23:47.538 --> 02:23:51.061
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically it's going to be Namco character shipping the game.

02:23:52.503 --> 02:23:53.684
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everybody does with Homestuck.

02:23:54.184 --> 02:24:04.933
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking at characters from Xenogears, Tekken, Idolmaster, Bites and Kratos, so... Here we go with Pac-Man.

02:24:04.953 --> 02:24:05.694
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds weird.

02:24:06.134 --> 02:24:06.975
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally getting it.

02:24:06.995 --> 02:24:08.056
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds weird.

02:24:08.076 --> 02:24:11.479
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like that one sim that they had where you date, like, birds.

02:24:11.719 --> 02:24:11.919
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

02:24:13.050 --> 02:24:15.651
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Hatafulboyfriend.

02:24:16.091 --> 02:24:17.712
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's go to the phones.

02:24:18.352 --> 02:24:19.713
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:24:19.733 --> 02:24:20.093
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

02:24:20.713 --> 02:24:22.334
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the one and only Ranma.

02:24:22.394 --> 02:24:23.695
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma, how's it going?

02:24:24.515 --> 02:24:25.155
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, good.

02:24:25.235 --> 02:24:27.917
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got a brand new mixer on Saturday.

02:24:28.197 --> 02:24:28.917
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, congrats.

02:24:29.217 --> 02:24:34.059
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to hear an even more high-fidelity anime jam session soon.

02:24:34.079 --> 02:24:35.360
[SPEAKER_07]: Either that or lots of margaritas.

02:24:37.171 --> 02:24:40.452
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll happen provided Drew Nami doesn't knock the desk over.

02:24:41.132 --> 02:24:42.253
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't invite him to your house.

02:24:43.633 --> 02:24:46.254
[SPEAKER_10]: I told him he had to sign a release form first.

02:24:47.074 --> 02:24:50.856
[SPEAKER_07]: In Drew Nami's defense, he came over on the 4th of July and didn't knock anything over.

02:24:51.196 --> 02:24:51.636
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

02:24:51.716 --> 02:24:53.817
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I actually, he needs to come back to the show.

02:24:53.857 --> 02:24:54.637
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been far too long.

02:24:56.498 --> 02:24:57.478
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds pretty cool.

02:24:57.998 --> 02:24:59.559
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, congrats on your new mixing board.

02:24:59.599 --> 02:25:00.159
[SPEAKER_11]: What else is up?

02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:13.464
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much, but I want to stand behind Loki and join him in the lynching of Ouya because I have my own issues when it comes to gaming customer service.

02:25:13.784 --> 02:25:20.567
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just close to literally losing my shit on Facebook and Twitter before they got back to me.

02:25:21.447 --> 02:25:24.048
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, why don't you air your grievances here?

02:25:25.225 --> 02:25:32.428
[SPEAKER_10]: Long story short, I bought a headset by Astro Gaming because I played them at PAX East last year and I loved them.

02:25:32.808 --> 02:25:36.889
[SPEAKER_10]: So what happened was there was a short in the headset or the mic was dead.

02:25:37.890 --> 02:25:45.432
[SPEAKER_10]: After waiting for the perfect time to pack up everything, I pack up the microphone, the headset, and the mixer because I was having troubles with that too.

02:25:45.973 --> 02:25:46.433
[SPEAKER_10]: Sent it out.

02:25:46.693 --> 02:25:49.254
[SPEAKER_10]: Two weeks later, I get a brand new mixer.

02:25:50.594 --> 02:25:53.335
[SPEAKER_10]: A brand new microphone, same headset.

02:25:53.775 --> 02:26:00.218
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm looking at the new mixer and they're telling me the battery that I had works for it, but the new mixer doesn't use the battery.

02:26:00.758 --> 02:26:02.419
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a couple extra connectors on there.

02:26:02.659 --> 02:26:04.820
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even use my optical out because they changed that.

02:26:05.340 --> 02:26:07.221
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm like, whatever, I can work with it.

02:26:07.581 --> 02:26:10.102
[SPEAKER_10]: I can still do my podcasting and the music and so forth.

02:26:10.622 --> 02:26:11.382
[SPEAKER_10]: Plug in the mic.

02:26:11.542 --> 02:26:12.583
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's working well.

02:26:13.624 --> 02:26:16.466
[SPEAKER_10]: A week later, the mics start shorting out again.

02:26:17.227 --> 02:26:22.510
[SPEAKER_10]: So I contact them, and I'm like, okay, what they're probably going to do is send me a new kit.

02:26:22.791 --> 02:26:24.332
[SPEAKER_10]: I pack up everything and send it back.

02:26:24.792 --> 02:26:28.635
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, no, we need you to pack up everything, send it to us, and we'll send it back to you.

02:26:29.295 --> 02:26:31.517
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, I use this for every day.

02:26:31.657 --> 02:26:32.558
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't be without it.

02:26:32.998 --> 02:26:37.621
[SPEAKER_10]: They say, okay, we'll send you a two-day UPS label.

02:26:38.042 --> 02:26:39.923
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, you're not helping me here.

02:26:41.624 --> 02:26:45.486
[SPEAKER_10]: So I end up going on their Twitter, their support Twitter, asking for help.

02:26:45.846 --> 02:26:49.808
[SPEAKER_10]: I go on their Facebook, asking for help, explaining everything.

02:26:50.769 --> 02:26:56.491
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually went as far as, when I was at PAX East this year, speaking to a rep at their booth to get this taken care of.

02:26:56.591 --> 02:26:59.013
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that's dedication to the cause.

02:26:59.733 --> 02:27:01.594
[SPEAKER_10]: I packed up all my equipment and took it down.

02:27:01.934 --> 02:27:05.276
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because I actually like the quality of the equipment.

02:27:05.596 --> 02:27:07.417
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just their customer service sucks.

02:27:07.817 --> 02:27:09.498
[SPEAKER_10]: And every email I get back from them,

02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:11.641
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:30.781
[SPEAKER_10]: Friday, I check Twitter.

02:27:30.821 --> 02:27:35.603
[SPEAKER_10]: I get a private message from the support saying they're so sorry since nothing has happened.

02:27:35.983 --> 02:27:37.004
[SPEAKER_10]: No one's gotten back to me.

02:27:37.364 --> 02:27:38.484
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been 30 days.

02:27:38.985 --> 02:27:45.628
[SPEAKER_10]: I get in my email an actual phone number where I can call them and talk to them and explain the whole situation.

02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:50.172
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, but did that actually fix it finally?

02:27:50.993 --> 02:27:54.395
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet, because this past weekend I took a semi sort of sabbatical.

02:27:54.475 --> 02:27:57.157
[SPEAKER_10]: I just stepped away, just did my own thing.

02:27:57.777 --> 02:28:00.800
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow, I'm going to call and just get this taken care of.

02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:05.323
[SPEAKER_10]: Because like I said, Astro, the headsets, the mixers, the stuff's really good.

02:28:05.483 --> 02:28:10.927
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't complain, because I use it for podcasting, listening to music, gaming on my consoles.

02:28:11.627 --> 02:28:11.727
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:28:11.747 --> 02:28:11.827
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:28:38.263 --> 02:28:39.224
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well anything else?

02:28:39.584 --> 02:28:41.746
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other grievances you want to air on tonight's OLR?

02:28:42.467 --> 02:28:42.867
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

02:28:42.947 --> 02:28:43.628
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just say this.

02:28:43.908 --> 02:28:46.050
[SPEAKER_10]: If you buy this, buy it from Best Buy.

02:28:46.231 --> 02:28:47.432
[SPEAKER_10]: Get their service plan.

02:28:47.932 --> 02:28:51.035
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll save you a lot of frustration and hair on your head.

02:28:51.536 --> 02:28:51.956
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

02:28:52.236 --> 02:28:53.377
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you take care, Ranma.

02:28:53.918 --> 02:28:54.478
[SPEAKER_11]: You too, bro.

02:28:54.558 --> 02:28:55.399
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, bye-bye.

02:28:56.880 --> 02:28:58.261
[SPEAKER_11]: Always good to hear from our buddy Ranma.

02:28:58.421 --> 02:29:00.962
[SPEAKER_11]: Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights here at the Voice Eats Network.

02:29:01.082 --> 02:29:01.442
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.

02:29:01.883 --> 02:29:06.625
[SPEAKER_11]: While we wait for more calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

02:29:06.805 --> 02:29:08.086
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have anything for last minutes?

02:29:08.246 --> 02:29:17.211
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have any last minute stories, but I'd like to, once again, because I threw around this idea on Twitter and all of it, I think I'm going to move forward with it, which is...

02:29:17.851 --> 02:29:34.402
[SPEAKER_12]: The, uh, Loki's 24-hour, uh, Total Noob Game Jam, basically, an experiment, because I've been going through this whole, like, game-making thing and actually just, you know, reading up a lot on programming and Unity and all that fun stuff, and now I just want to get my, get my hands dirty with it.

02:29:35.163 --> 02:29:40.386
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, the experiment is basically, I'm gonna spend 24 hours putting together a game.

02:29:40.466 --> 02:29:44.469
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, obviously, unlike regular game jams, I don't have enough time to sit...

02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:47.111
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not 24 consecutive hours.

02:29:47.592 --> 02:29:48.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, because our phone's lighting up.

02:29:49.073 --> 02:29:52.456
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll come back to your thoughts in a minute here, but let's go to the phones.

02:29:52.837 --> 02:29:53.958
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:53.978 --> 02:29:54.358
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

02:29:55.359 --> 02:29:56.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey, it's LokiLives46.

02:29:57.521 --> 02:29:59.403
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, say that again.

02:29:59.463 --> 02:30:01.725
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... LokiLives46.

02:30:02.146 --> 02:30:05.369
[SPEAKER_11]: LokiLives46, but no relation to our Loki.

02:30:06.471 --> 02:30:08.011
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, unfortunately not.

02:30:09.132 --> 02:30:10.772
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it is a commonly used name.

02:30:11.332 --> 02:30:12.472
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, where did you get yours?

02:30:12.512 --> 02:30:15.173
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours did not come from Thor or anything.

02:30:15.213 --> 02:30:16.333
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours came from The Mask.

02:30:16.353 --> 02:30:17.214
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a fan of Jim Carrey.

02:30:17.294 --> 02:30:19.454
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mask, way back when, right?

02:30:20.034 --> 02:30:21.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

02:30:21.715 --> 02:30:24.635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a bit of a persona I've taken up.

02:30:26.456 --> 02:30:29.196
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a very mischievous little brat.

02:30:29.296 --> 02:30:31.537
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, so yours is inspired from The Mask, too?

02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:33.781
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:30:54.713 --> 02:30:55.575
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, so are we.

02:30:55.615 --> 02:30:57.559
[SPEAKER_11]: You're in good company here at the Voice Geeks Network.

02:30:57.579 --> 02:31:02.008
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're all a little nerdy.

02:31:02.068 --> 02:31:03.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, how have things been going for you guys?

02:31:04.232 --> 02:31:04.593
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

02:31:05.384 --> 02:31:06.624
[SPEAKER_03]: How have things been going for you guys?

02:31:08.105 --> 02:31:08.845
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantastic!

02:31:09.445 --> 02:31:12.967
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, DarkSakura?

02:31:13.267 --> 02:31:14.267
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the listeners want to know.

02:31:14.307 --> 02:31:15.087
[SPEAKER_11]: How the hell are you?

02:31:15.488 --> 02:31:16.248
[SPEAKER_07]: I want this house.

02:31:16.728 --> 02:31:18.269
[SPEAKER_11]: You want this house that you've been looking at?

02:31:18.409 --> 02:31:18.629
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm longing.

02:31:18.649 --> 02:31:19.289
[SPEAKER_07]: She's house hunting.

02:31:19.489 --> 02:31:20.109
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm longing.

02:31:20.449 --> 02:31:20.730
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:31:21.130 --> 02:31:22.470
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm employed now, so that's good.

02:31:22.570 --> 02:31:27.752
[SPEAKER_11]: And our Loki is full of gummy bears, but he just ran to the kitchen real quick.

02:31:28.532 --> 02:31:29.913
[SPEAKER_03]: I pity his porcelain right now.

02:31:30.313 --> 02:31:30.733
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

02:31:30.953 --> 02:31:32.274
[SPEAKER_03]: What, you're not a gummy bear fan?

02:31:32.374 --> 02:31:32.874
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that?

02:31:33.849 --> 02:31:36.472
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just that high concentration of sugar.

02:31:36.552 --> 02:31:37.853
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm allergic to them.

02:31:38.013 --> 02:31:41.817
[SPEAKER_12]: I already ate some of them, but there's no way I'm going to eat a ton of them.

02:31:41.897 --> 02:31:43.379
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll seriously make me feel sick.

02:31:45.161 --> 02:31:45.761
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fair enough.

02:31:46.082 --> 02:31:47.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I'll let you guys get back to it.

02:31:47.863 --> 02:31:48.784
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, fair enough.

02:31:49.245 --> 02:31:50.927
[SPEAKER_11]: No games you want to talk about tonight or anything?

02:31:50.947 --> 02:31:51.828
[SPEAKER_11]: What have you been playing?

02:31:52.909 --> 02:31:55.732
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just been crazy busy with work, so I haven't really had a chance to.

02:31:57.567 --> 02:31:59.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you better get on that.

02:31:59.909 --> 02:32:03.411
[SPEAKER_11]: Last day of the Steam sale, last chance he games at a discount.

02:32:03.451 --> 02:32:04.451
[SPEAKER_11]: Put all that money to use.

02:32:06.332 --> 02:32:08.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my wallet doesn't like those Steam sales.

02:32:08.253 --> 02:32:09.954
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you that much.

02:32:09.974 --> 02:32:10.415
[SPEAKER_11]: That happens.

02:32:10.475 --> 02:32:11.015
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, buddy.

02:32:11.035 --> 02:32:11.755
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thanks for the call.

02:32:11.775 --> 02:32:12.256
[SPEAKER_11]: You take care.

02:32:12.976 --> 02:32:13.396
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you too.

02:32:13.496 --> 02:32:14.077
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, bye.

02:32:15.497 --> 02:32:18.139
[SPEAKER_11]: He just called to ask, how the hell are you?

02:32:19.562 --> 02:32:20.443
[SPEAKER_11]: Alive and kicking.

02:32:20.923 --> 02:32:21.324
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hot.

02:32:21.464 --> 02:32:22.345
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very courteous.

02:32:22.365 --> 02:32:23.486
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is a little hot, isn't it?

02:32:23.546 --> 02:32:26.449
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not even like one of those... It's getting hot in here.

02:32:26.509 --> 02:32:30.893
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll make sure the AC is on while... Well, I think it doesn't... Aren't you guys cooking a pizza or something?

02:32:30.993 --> 02:32:31.594
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

02:32:31.614 --> 02:32:33.275
[SPEAKER_11]: He's making a baked potato or something.

02:32:33.295 --> 02:32:34.116
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I see.

02:32:34.296 --> 02:32:36.158
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure these walls are really insulated.

02:32:36.198 --> 02:32:37.239
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

02:32:37.279 --> 02:32:37.559
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

02:32:37.860 --> 02:32:38.060
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:39.821
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:32:58.268 --> 02:33:02.509
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see if that's feasible or not, depending on where I actually have to record and the times and that kind of stuff.

02:33:03.249 --> 02:33:04.349
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to livestream it.

02:33:04.369 --> 02:33:06.230
[SPEAKER_12]: At the very least, it's going to go up on YouTube.

02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:10.131
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want some sort of interactivity with that.

02:33:10.191 --> 02:33:13.411
[SPEAKER_12]: So obviously, chat room will be involved.

02:33:13.711 --> 02:33:18.372
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to actually have polls at different parts during it.

02:33:18.392 --> 02:33:23.694
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is going to be, I think, what concept should we go ahead... Because I can make anything.

02:33:23.774 --> 02:33:25.414
[SPEAKER_12]: So what are we going to make...

02:33:26.694 --> 02:33:32.436
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll come up with a couple ideas and maybe people vote on it and we'll go from there and later on as we get more into it.

02:33:32.956 --> 02:33:38.518
[SPEAKER_12]: And hell, I don't know if I'll actually create a game in 24 hours because I've never made anything before, but I think I can do it.

02:33:38.558 --> 02:33:40.139
[SPEAKER_11]: I love how you're doing your game jams.

02:33:40.219 --> 02:33:43.500
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never made a game before, but I'm pretty sure I can do one in 24 hours.

02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:43.880
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:45.940
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

02:33:45.980 --> 02:33:46.541
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll try it.

02:33:46.601 --> 02:33:49.982
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, hell, I've watched a video where someone made a game in three minutes.

02:33:50.022 --> 02:33:51.062
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it can be done.

02:33:51.122 --> 02:33:52.823
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be a good game?

02:33:52.843 --> 02:33:53.863
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

02:33:54.083 --> 02:33:54.303
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

02:33:54.840 --> 02:34:00.628
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the noob night that Bobby and I keep talking about for Borderlands 2, except your noob night is programming.

02:34:01.088 --> 02:34:02.190
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it'd be fun.

02:34:02.370 --> 02:34:03.551
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of want to do it.

02:34:03.592 --> 02:34:06.395
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, as Bobby suggested, make a poll on the forum.

02:34:06.415 --> 02:34:10.080
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I'll start off with doing that, and we'll do updates in there and stuff.

02:34:11.241 --> 02:34:13.002
[SPEAKER_12]: See where it goes, because I think it'd be fun.

02:34:13.102 --> 02:34:15.062
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you should try to make one of the OLR Dream games.

02:34:15.082 --> 02:34:16.603
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, see, I knew you would say that.

02:34:16.803 --> 02:34:19.203
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew you would say that, but here's why I don't want to do that.

02:34:19.223 --> 02:34:21.384
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if I'm going to make one of those, it's got to be a good game.

02:34:21.524 --> 02:34:24.485
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to make my first experiment at something that's going to suck.

02:34:25.625 --> 02:34:28.066
[SPEAKER_12]: One of those games, no offense.

02:34:28.126 --> 02:34:30.987
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd rather do it when I'm able to make something a little bit better.

02:34:32.007 --> 02:34:32.948
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a dream game after all.

02:34:32.968 --> 02:34:35.349
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to just crap out something.

02:34:35.749 --> 02:34:36.210
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

02:34:36.270 --> 02:34:39.071
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to make sure that the time is taken to get it right.

02:34:39.091 --> 02:34:42.013
[SPEAKER_12]: Besides, I have a lot of really crazy ideas for things.

02:34:42.093 --> 02:34:44.554
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, all sorts of silly things.

02:34:45.395 --> 02:34:48.617
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let me quickly go to some tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

02:34:49.697 --> 02:34:50.978
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at a few tweets here.

02:34:51.779 --> 02:34:57.522
[SPEAKER_11]: SS2100Matt tweeted us about going to EA's NHL 94 anniversary mode party in New York City.

02:34:58.022 --> 02:35:03.786
[SPEAKER_11]: and he actually took some footage that he posted over on Facebook and yeah, I saw that earlier in the week and it looks pretty cool.

02:35:04.146 --> 02:35:17.394
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how they put that mode in there to kind of, you know, with the stars under the player and all that to kind of go back to the classic and I heard EA didn't really like him taking some of that footage but I'm glad his rogue footage made it to Facebook after all.

02:35:18.334 --> 02:35:19.755
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw is sending us a couple tweets.

02:35:20.536 --> 02:35:23.277
[SPEAKER_11]: Oculus Rift is planned for PC and mobile but consoles?

02:35:23.397 --> 02:35:24.138
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a focus.

02:35:24.158 --> 02:35:24.558
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:35:24.798 --> 02:35:31.665
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I suppose would go a ways in... Wasn't there some rumor about PlayStation 4 getting Oculus Rift at some point?

02:35:31.705 --> 02:35:34.087
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say right around E3 there was some wank on that.

02:35:34.227 --> 02:35:36.109
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, it can support any platform.

02:35:36.169 --> 02:35:38.111
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just... It's HDMI inputs.

02:35:38.352 --> 02:35:43.797
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically... It just has to output that display and it can work with pretty much anything.

02:35:43.917 --> 02:35:46.540
[SPEAKER_12]: So... Well, actually, no.

02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:47.060
[SPEAKER_12]: I take that back.

02:35:47.100 --> 02:35:48.662
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit more complex than that, but...

02:35:49.042 --> 02:35:51.704
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think they said consoles at one time.

02:35:52.244 --> 02:35:57.488
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, if it has native support for Unreal 4, both consoles can run that.

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:04.373
[SPEAKER_12]: And Source... I'm not really sure what other engines are going to be supporting it natively, but...

02:36:04.993 --> 02:36:06.735
[SPEAKER_12]: and more and more are supporting it.

02:36:06.795 --> 02:36:07.996
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wouldn't see why not.

02:36:08.356 --> 02:36:08.616
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:36:09.437 --> 02:36:13.960
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Tiger Claw letting us know that a new side-scrolling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game is coming in October.

02:36:15.641 --> 02:36:17.363
[SPEAKER_11]: Activision talked about this in a press release.

02:36:17.423 --> 02:36:19.665
[SPEAKER_11]: It's based on the Nickelodeon version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

02:36:19.685 --> 02:36:20.945
[SPEAKER_07]: You know they're doing a new movie, right?

02:36:21.186 --> 02:36:21.706
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I knew that.

02:36:21.726 --> 02:36:22.587
[SPEAKER_07]: With Megan Fox.

02:36:23.621 --> 02:36:24.602
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I heard about that.

02:36:26.344 --> 02:36:26.784
[SPEAKER_11]: Pass.

02:36:28.386 --> 02:36:34.832
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, lastly, Spazinator on Twitter wants to know, after the show's over, anyone up for a game of Left 4 Dead 2?

02:36:35.633 --> 02:36:37.294
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if not Left 4 Dead 2, then Civ 4.

02:36:38.058 --> 02:36:39.419
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up for a game of driving home

02:36:58.667 --> 02:37:01.609
[SPEAKER_11]: Go meet Raginator, Spazinator, whatever he's called.

02:37:01.909 --> 02:37:04.750
[SPEAKER_11]: Go meet him in our VOG Network group and get a game going.

02:37:05.210 --> 02:37:07.251
[SPEAKER_11]: He wants to kill some zombies with you.

02:37:07.752 --> 02:37:08.192
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun.

02:37:09.192 --> 02:37:09.493
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:37:10.133 --> 02:37:12.374
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess that's going to do it for our Skype line tonight.

02:37:13.234 --> 02:37:16.156
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess it's going to start to do it for the end of our show.

02:37:16.576 --> 02:37:18.377
[SPEAKER_11]: It's starting to get really hot in here, you guys.

02:37:18.877 --> 02:37:24.080
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a hot day in Sacramento, and then we're running the oven right now because I guess Alan started dinner, so it's like...

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:24.940
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:37:51.269 --> 02:38:18.213
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder how long it's going to take me to get all those gummy bears My final thought is I'm going to need to really convince myself not to buy Rogue Legacy while it's at least 20% off during the Steam sale and I was holding out for a deeper discount or else I'm probably going to end up buying that later tonight because I do want to get that I've heard a lot of good things about it

02:38:19.212 --> 02:38:19.572
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn it.

02:38:20.273 --> 02:38:21.373
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn you, Steam Sale.

02:38:21.533 --> 02:38:22.714
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have gotten Little Inferno.

02:38:23.134 --> 02:38:23.654
[SPEAKER_11]: Damn you.

02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:24.395
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you have it?

02:38:24.615 --> 02:38:25.295
[SPEAKER_11]: I still might.

02:38:25.395 --> 02:38:25.975
[SPEAKER_11]: You never know.

02:38:26.015 --> 02:38:26.916
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun, Rob.

02:38:27.916 --> 02:38:33.119
