Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, July 21, 2013, a long-awaited Nintendo classic finally hits Wii U Virtual Console,

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
a dormant franchise re-emerges with a new game announcement at Comic-Con, and things get heated with one EA Sports franchise.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number 513, July 21, 2013.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about all things video gaming

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
And, of course, my co-hosts, not here right now, DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers, she is running a little late tonight.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
She has more of those home buying, being an adult things that she's doing right now,

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
but she'll be joining us, hopefully momentarily, within the next 30 minutes or so.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
But, in the meantime, joining me live in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm working on a bag of three pounds of gummy bears.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I was going to say, you brought a lot of different stuff with you, fun things to the show tonight.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
What are these things you brought to the studio with you? A giant package of Haribo gummy bears.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
And not that I'm complaining, gummy bears are amazing, but that's three pounds. That's a lot of candy.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
I will eat it until it makes me sick. It's one of these things, we had a coupon from our local grocery store

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
where you spend 50 bucks and you get 10 bucks back.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
And so, I bought all of our groceries for the week, and they're pretty affordable as it is.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
And so, I get to the counter and it's like, yeah, you have $47. I'm like, crap, I need something else.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I was like, okay, well, maybe I'll get some M&M's. Ah, they're the crappy pretzel M&M's.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Gummy bears!

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
So, you know, that kind of paid for itself.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
There you go. Well, gummy bears are always exciting, and you know I'm going to steal some before the night is over.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
So, you've kind of had a busy week, and before we get into our gaming weeks and all that stuff,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I want to talk to you about some of the variety of things that's gone on this week.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
But, of course, I do want to introduce the always-present fourth guest in our show, the chat room.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
And even though Bobby's opinion on games sometimes can be very wrong,

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
we do still support all our indie podcast friends, even when they don't agree with you that Super Metroid is the greatest game ever made.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I mean, geez, how can somebody not think that?

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
But, diversity, I suppose. We have to embrace a diverse environment.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
It's fine. It's going to be the greatest game ever made up until Grand Theft Auto V comes out, and then, you know.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Things might change. You are trying to pressure me into the Grand Theft Auto V.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
I might have to do it. You know, I've been taking a break from the MMOs lately,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
because all my friends quit World of Warcraft, basically.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
No, I shouldn't say all. I have some friends that play World of Warcraft still, but very few.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Like, I signed in for the first time today in, like, six days, and I had a bunch of friends that were like,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
oh my gosh, where have you been?

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
But, I've been really able to catch up on a lot of single-player games, like Steam and stuff like that,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
which I'll get into in my gaming week, but Grand Theft Auto IV is still sitting there on the list of things I need to do.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
You need to play it.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, I know. I know I do.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Alright, going to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Rambo wants to know, are they vodka-infused gummy bears?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
No, not yet.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
No, it's more like heat-infused gummy bears that have been sitting in my car.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
And I've actually seen it before. What happens if they sit in my car for a very long time,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
it will literally conform to the bag, and it'll be just one solid mass of gummy bears.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
LokiLives46, I don't know if that's in reference to your name, or if you just both happen to be Loki,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
but LokiLives46 says that's almost a gross amount of sugar, man.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
I won't eat them all in one day, because it seriously, right now, it feels like I have a weight in my stomach.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Because I just finished eating dinner, and then I had this.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Well, gummy bears expand in your stomach, you know.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Oh, I didn't know.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
No, I'm kidding. I don't know. I'm just messing with you.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Alright, so some of the other fun things you did with your week.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
I love it when you bring presents to the show with you, and tonight you brought presents.

04:23.000 --> 04:31.000
You brought this little Lego kit where you can actually build your own little, just tiny little Star Trek Enterprise.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
It's one of those mini, it comes in like the plastic bag things, and you know, it's not too difficult.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
I was building during Bobby's show, and well, not the whole thing, like the last ten minutes, I'm already almost done.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
But where did you get this from, and what's been going on?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
I got it from the Namco band I rep, because they came to my work this week.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
We do this kind of, what used to be a game summit, now it's like an entertainment summit,

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
because they have a couple movie studios coming, now there's also the other things that we sell as well,

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
including Wonder Chalk, which is like this modeling chocolate stuff now.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
So yeah, so they had a bunch of game companies out and stuff, and they show us what's coming out.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
I got to see a few different, we'll talk about some of the stuff in gaming week I guess,

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
but I got to see a few different things. There's a few guys that brought dev kits with them.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
Ubisoft brought Splinter Cell Blacklist, so I got to play a little of that.

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
Tecmo Koe, they brought Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z, so I got to play the E3 demo of that.

05:35.000 --> 05:42.000
And I didn't actually play it, but Activision brought Skylanders, Swap Force.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
I did fondle the toys a little bit, because there was no one at the booth at the time,

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
so I was looking at them, and the top and bottom halves are held together with magnets.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
As you would expect, I guess. Very disappointed that Disney did not...

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Magnets! How did they work?

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
I was very disappointed that Disney did not bring their Disney Infinity stuff.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
They only had a video, which I've already seen.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
And what else?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Well, it's neat that they were able to bring stuff to your work at all,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
because there's other game stuff going on right now.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
There's a lot of stuff going on at Comic Con, it seems even more gaming news this year than usual.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
And then PAX Australia, which oddly haven't been hearing a lot coming out of PAX Australia.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I forgot it was even this week.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't think there was a lot of news to break.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
I'm sure some great local news and some indie news that just hasn't shown up on my radar yet,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
because I've been too obsessed with the Steam sale and Earthbound and all that.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
But there hasn't really been a lot of news broken at PAX Australia,

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
but I'm sure it's been really cool for them to just experience PAX,

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
and getting all the nerds in one place and the big gaming rooms and all that.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
But my favorite part about the whole thing was actually something that didn't even take place.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, it took place at the event, but more of the after event, like the dinner.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Okay, so I have a couple reps that work at different companies.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
One guy, my friend Daniel, he's worked at a bunch of different companies.

07:05.000 --> 07:12.000
I've known him since he's worked at Konami, Namco, he's working at D3 now.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
And then there's also Len, who actually owns a company now.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
He owns Maximum Family Games.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
They do a lot of family product.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
Recently they've been doing some of these Xbox Live Arcade titles come to disc version.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
They just released the Serious Sam collection on 360,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
and they had the Worms collection back in May on PS3 and 360 and stuff like that.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
But that's not the thing.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
So they've been in the industry forever, like ever and ever.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
And before, they used to both work at Sega a long time ago,

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
like back when they were launching the Genesis a long time ago and stuff.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
And so they were telling me so many stories.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It was just fantastic.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
First off, Len was telling me stories about how, since he owns the company and stuff,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
they deal a lot with shipping to Brazil and stuff and about all the difficulties with that

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
and how you get product in there and stuff and how you have to almost bribe officials

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
and stuff to get things in there is crazy.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
But the stories from Sega were great.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
They were talking about how they came up with, I guess they announced the core system

08:24.000 --> 08:32.000
for the Sega Genesis at CES one of these years or something.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
And they were telling, I guess everyone was saying,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh, well, that's a brilliant idea and stuff.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Because it was the first time that they had ever come out with a game system

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
that was actually called a core system.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
It's kind of surprising that they've never released a game system

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
without a game packed in before or something cheaper, I guess.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
But he was just saying, yeah, they literally came up with that idea the night before.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Some guy went to Kinko's, had the box printed up, and they put it on the roof,

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
covered it with some sort of tarp thing and then revealed it at CES.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
But just a whole lot of things talking about how they were asking him,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
so what do you guys think about the 32X?

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
Do you think this is going to be something that's going to work for consumers and stuff

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
and how they're saying it's such a bad idea and everything?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I don't know. It just sounded like a lot of fun.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I wish I could have got the guys on the show to talk about that kind of stuff,

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
but obviously they don't want a lot of the stuff coming back verbatim.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Some people would get butthurt about that kind of stuff.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Okay, total derailment here, but you're in the background of my Vine.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Can I still post that?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Oh, I don't care.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Just making sure.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
I always ask permission before I post people's face on the internet,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
but I wanted to show off my Lego Enterprise because I finished.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
There you go.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Well, I'm glad you got to reminisce with people and old friends

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
that have moved from company to company and catch up on some of the drums, right?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, it's fun.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
And then also my other friend from, I guess it's not really a publisher,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
but he's a rep firm.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
He works with, oh, what is it now?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
It's Watt & Company.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
He works with them.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I don't know.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
There's a lot of these guys I've seen for a long time

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
because they've been here every single year.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
There's a few reps that cycle through and stuff.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I did get to meet with Microsoft.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Oh, my God.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I swear to God.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
One thing you'll learn about Microsoft if you're in the industry and stuff

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
and if you actually get face-to-face contact with some of these reps,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
they're different than everybody else.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
You'll talk to them, and you get this vibe from them.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
It's just very much the Microsoft way of doing things.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
For example, we were actually sitting down and having lunch,

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
and my coworkers started asking them questions about the Xbox One

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
and all the critical stuff about the Xbox One and stuff,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
and just listening to the guys spin stuff.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
I mean, obviously, he's kind of along the lines with how we're thinking.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
It's really early, and a lot of this stuff is going to change,

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
so you can't really say too much about what it's going to be in the final product

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
considering that they can just turn around.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
But just like such the, well, we were listening to the consumers and blah, blah, blah.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
For example, I set up items for a company.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
I set up items, and I don't have any of the first-party setup information,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
so I asked Microsoft, hey, can you provide me a list of the UPCs

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
for the stuff that you have coming out?

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah, we're sorry, because you see, you guys don't really buy direct from us,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
so you're going to have to ask somebody else.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
What the fuck?

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Oh, but we're supporting you guys.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
That's why we're out here today.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
What? Okay, fine.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
You can't give me stuff to set up the items in our system so that we can sell your product.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I just won't bother pushing for that since.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
We'll just not sell your product then.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
I don't know.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
The whole thing's a corporate script.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
The whole thing is ridiculous.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
This was the weird thing at E3, too,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
is that there was just such the corporate script that nobody was going to deviate from.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Basically, everything benefits them.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
They say they're thinking about the consumer, but it's always what's going to benefit Microsoft,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
and that's what it comes down to.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
That's everything that I've talked to them and listening to their spiel and stuff like that.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
This isn't something new.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
This has been around since the first year of Microsoft.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
It's never about here's the upcoming games we have and stuff like that.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
You guys need to sell more of our accessories.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
You need to sell more.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
This is how you should be upselling these games.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
When someone orders a Halo 4, you should ask them,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
do you want a year of live with that, too?

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Dude, first off, I'm not selling retail, for one.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
And two, my customers order live cards when they need them and stuff.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
They don't need to be pushed for that stuff.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I remember the first year.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
This is when the Xbox 360 launched.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Our guy, who is actually higher up now,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
he's like, yeah, you guys need to be selling.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You need to be pushing the accessories.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
Cool, but you're not shipping any to us because they're allocated.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
We want to order them.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
We're trying to sell them, but you're not shipping any.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
And now you're telling us that we need to push them,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
but we can't because you're not shipping any to us.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
That's hilarious.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
It's like banging your head against the wall.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Well, the line is that's the stuff they're trying to sell and push.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Sony on the other hand, I must add, asked them the same thing.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Hey, I need setup information for UPCs.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Guy gives me his card.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
He says, send me an email and I'll get you the information you need.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Was that so fucking hard?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
And guess what?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
We don't buy direct from them either.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
So perfect example.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
It shouldn't be that difficult to get information from them to sell their product.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
What he just said.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Hi.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Welcome to the show.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
How are you?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Hopeful.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
You smell like sandwich.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Did you bring a sandwich?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
I brought Panda.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Oh, okay.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
You were so wrong.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I haven't eaten all day.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
That's fine.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
That's fine.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
All right.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Loki, one other thing I want to ask you about,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
especially now that Dark Soccer is here to hear this,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
the Ouya thing you've been tweeting about.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Oh God.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Come on.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
What's up with the Ouya stuff?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Okay.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
So since I've gotten my Ouya,

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
I don't even know if you've noticed on that controller that,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
since you're borrowing the system now,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
the analog six are fucked up.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Basically.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
I just thought that was part of the system.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
No.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
No.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
It's actually the analog six.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Because if you play with a PS3 controller, it works just fine.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
But the analog six are fucked up.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
They have like these really weird dead zones on them where if you try to move diagonally,

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
it's like it doesn't,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
it registers you pushing it almost like a quarter of the way instead of all the way.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It's just not, it doesn't work right.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Like if you try to run in circles, it looks really weird.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
So it was a defect.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
It was a defect that was in the first run of those controllers.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
And it's something that's documented.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
And it's something I tested and I saw the same thing that they came up with.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
So I've been trying to get it replaced recently.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Because I know they've been busy with the launch and stuff,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
and it's just getting a hold of customer service.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I started my claim,

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
or I should say my support ticket back in June on the 25th.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
And the first response I got from them was kind of a canned response.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Because everyone's asking, you know, where's my OUYA system?

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
So it was all this information about, you know, when your OUYA system's coming

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
and when, you know, how to track it and all that stuff.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
I'm like, well, if you read the ticket I sent you,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
it has nothing to do with what I've been asking.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
And then so finally I got a response from,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
and the guy sent me this RMA thing, so I filled it all out,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
took a picture of the serial number and stuff,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
and I hadn't heard from him in two weeks.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
I'm like, okay.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I keep responding back to the thread.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I'm like, hey, where do we go from here?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
What's going on here?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And so then finally he's like, I get a response back,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
your replacement faceplates have been sent out

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
because I guess there's some problem with some of the faceplates,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
and so people are requesting the faceplates.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Once again, didn't read anything that I sent them.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
You know, I'm like, dude, I don't need faceplates.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I need a new controller.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I can take the faceplates off,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
and the controller works just the same as it does now.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
It's so weird that they wouldn't go back and read the notes unless,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
I mean, I wonder if it's not an outsource thing,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
where if like certain words aren't there that, I mean,

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
a certain very literal script is usually followed in an outsource environment.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It doesn't sound like, you know,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I mean, unless they're just making up names,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
but I mean, it's like Chad and, you know,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
EA's does that.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm just saying, so it took me filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
which they already have, you know,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
it looks like a few complaints against them already.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
They're not part of the Better Business Bureau yet,

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
and that didn't really do anything.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
So then I had a complaint on Twitter,

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
and so finally got the attention of their community manager,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and she kind of got the ball rolling a little bit,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
and I finally got another response saying that I was supposed to be,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
he's forwarding my thing to the RMA department.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
So still, I don't have a fixed controller.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I mean, literally, I could have gone out to the store,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
it's not the right way to do it,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
but I could have gone to the store, bought a brand new Ouia controller,

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
and took it back, took my old controller back as defective,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
and got my money back, and could have had it replaced weeks ago,

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
but, you know, I wanted to do it through the proper channels,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
although if I get dicked around for another couple weeks,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
I am going to do that.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
So that's where I'm at. I still don't have a fixed controller yet.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
What a mess.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Yeah.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Customer service is so important.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Their customer service is absolutely terrible.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
And then this goes just the full gamut.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
It's just not been good at all.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And yeah, I understand that they're a new company,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
but come on, man.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
They've been dealing with customer service issues for the last three months now.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
They should be a little bit more on top of it.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
I mean, just even getting back to people,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
you know, in a timely manner, or reading the email.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
If you're getting a read back, you know, respond back to somebody,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
read through what the whole problem is when you're saying,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
oh, I'm going to send you replacement faceplates.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
That's not going to fucking fix the problem.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
I don't know. It's just, it's strange.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
But, and now they've got, like, some more news about what they're trying to do,

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
the drive-up sales and stuff,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
and even, like, their response to the NPD numbers this month.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
They're saying, oh, yeah, the Ouia launch hasn't been very successful

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
because they haven't sold that many units.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
They're like, well, we sold out of all of our units.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
We're chasing demand right now.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah, because your manufacturing is so fucking slow.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
But, I don't know, it's, I'm just kind of over that system already.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
It's kind of felt like it was a whole mistake to back it in the first place, but.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, Dan said he wanted one.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
And I'm like, no, we're not getting one.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm putting my foot down.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
It's not, it's not terrible.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
It's, and I think it's going to get better because it's just a system right now.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
You know, it's all up to the developers and what they're, you know,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
coming out with and stuff.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
And they even had some stuff that came out of their, like,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
little game jam thing that they did that looked really cool,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
but not a lot of it's actually been made yet.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Like, there's a game called Television that I wanted to play.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
It was kind of this weird, like, almost like a WarioWare type of game.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
And it just hasn't come out yet, but it looked kind of cool.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
And they've got some other games that look really neat on them,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
plus you can sideload stuff.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
But a lot of the stuff that they promised, like,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
that was going to be easily routable.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
Like, they were going to basically have almost like a one button root for it.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
That hasn't happened.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
And, hell, it can't even access, you know, external storage devices yet.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
None of that stuff's happened.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
It can't, you know, it doesn't have any sort of online multiplayer.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
There's no, like, any, you know, sharing of, like, friend,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
there's no friends list things built into it.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
There's nothing.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
It's just very rushed, I guess.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
WhatupG asks in chat, who has great customer service?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I can think of a few companies.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
I'll say my car insurance company, AAA, has always been really good to me.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I can't really complain about them at all.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
I would say the masters of customer service.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
I've never seen anyone do it better.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Disney. Disneyland.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, but I'm saying as far as game industry,

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
I actually had really good customer service with Blizzard.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
The two times I've had to call, I had really good service.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
I don't like how long I've had to wait in some of the hold times,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
but once you get through to somebody, yeah,

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
my experiences with Blizzard has been good.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
I can't complain.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
The best, or one of the best is supposed to be Zappos,

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
but I've never really ordered from them,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
although I've met them, met the people at the company,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
and they're all really great.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
They're all shoes, right?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
They're shoes and clothing and stuff.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
They did get into electronics for a while.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I actually sold them games for a little bit,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
but they're really great.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
I mean, just everybody there is fantastic.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
They're a very unique corporate culture, too.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
It really works for them.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
It's really cool.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
None of the executives have offices there.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
They're all down there in cubicles with everybody,

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
and it's just very, it's good morale,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
and just everybody is really happy to work there,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
and I think that's how you do it.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
You keep people happy, and they will be happy.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I mean, if they're pissed off at their job,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
they're not going to be happy to your customers.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
The place that I just got hired for believes the same thing,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
and everyone looked super happy there.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
I'm not going to say where I got hired, but still.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Technist in Chat says,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Costco has amazing customer service.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Returns with no question asked.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
They changed some of that policy lately.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I mean, I think they still probably have

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
the most liberal return policy in most companies,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
but it's not as crazy as it used to be.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Tiger Claw asks, Rob, you're a corporate trainer.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Do you teach customer service?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I did for seven years, and obviously,

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
just due to separating my day job and my hobby,

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm not going to tell you where I work,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
or much more than that, but yes,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I taught customer service for seven years,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
and I actually still, even though,

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I am still a corporate trainer.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
I teach something else.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I sometimes teach customer service elements,

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
and I still write some manuals relating to that,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
so that's why it's important to me,

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
and I think a lot of companies,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
I hate it when they let it go,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
because one of the biggest things about customer service

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
is just having to have the mentality.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
You want to do good things.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
That's 90% of it right there, so anyway,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
I won't get into too much more than that.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
A lot of people in chat saying Amazon.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Rama's saying Newegg is great customer service.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Bonds006 says, how can I forget Nintendo?

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
They have yet to let me down.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
And I've worked in customer service

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
for a solid eight years, so trust me,

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
when you're in it, you know what not to do.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I've called people out on stuff.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
Yeah, and I've actually, when I get good phone service,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
which I can't remember the last company I got it from.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
It's just been, I don't actually call places a whole lot.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
I kind of prefer to do interactions online myself,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
but the last time I called somebody,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I asked such good customer service,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I actually said, can I talk to your manager

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
and leave a compliment?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
You know what I usually do?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
They love that.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Actually, it's even better.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
If you like someone's job,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
ask for the fax number, fax them a letter,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
because when I worked in customer service before,

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
verbal compliments were really good,

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
but written compliments were like the gold star,

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
they were the diamond star.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah, and if you're willing to do that,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
not waste your time, spend your time doing something like that,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
you know, that, you know.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I got 14 of them in one year.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I got taken out to dinner five times.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Little did show off.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
No, it was that one year that we were so super busy

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
and I worked all that overtime,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
but I actually just sort of gave up on the call time

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
and ended up helping out whoever it was,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
because it was really freaking busy.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
And it's one thing when you have 255 calls in queue,

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
and your queue max is 255.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Anyway, I don't know how we got on that.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Oh, yeah, we have stuff.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
But anyway, anything else about your antics this week

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
you want to share with us, Loki,

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
before we get into gaming weeks?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
That's pretty much it.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
All right, let's get into how was your gaming week

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
and the types of video games

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
that you have been playing this week.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Animal Crossing.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Still?

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Yep.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Ooh, is my DS around?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
I got to make sure.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I got to make sure our 3DS is mate.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
I turned mine on.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Mine's been on all day.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Actually, when I went to South Sac yesterday,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I straight passed two people there.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
I have no idea who,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
but there were two people in South Sac,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
so if you're listening, I straight passed you totally.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
And then, yeah, I actually, let's see,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I've just expanded my second room.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
So I've expanded my upstairs,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I've expanded my house twice,

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
the upstairs once, my side room once,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
my other side room once,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
and now I'm going to be expanding my basement.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
I have like 56,000 bills left.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Okay, anyone who wants a tip,

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
fish on the island.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Fish on the island, cat sharks.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Throw everything back if they're not a shark.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I've heard beetles on the island.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Yeah, some of the beetles, not all of them.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
The Goliath ones are worth some money.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
And that's, oh, and I finished Little Inferno.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
That game is weird.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
That was the one where you set things on fire, right?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Yes, I love that game.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Good times.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And that's really about it,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
because I've been job interviewing.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I've been shopping for professional clothes.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
But congrats, you got the job,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
and I know you don't want to say,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
well, you'll tell me all about it off air, but.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I pretty much knew I had it right after the interview,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
because they're already talking about other stuff.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
That's a good feeling.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Well, congrats.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And the company is really reputable.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
I'm not going to say anything,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
because I do want that window of separation.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah, we all do.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
But they're a really good, reputable,

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
long-standing company who got very high ratings

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
for how well they take care of their employees.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Wow.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Well, what a positive time between that and the house stuff.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
And then, yeah, we found two really good houses today,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
and we put out an offer on one of them today.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Nice.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
And a little two-bedroom house,

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
but we have a big office in it.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah, well, fingers and toes crossed.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
And my own bathroom.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
All right.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
So, yeah.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Fingers, is that the one out,

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
I guess I can say Antelope.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Was that the one at Antelope?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
An Antelope.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
That's going to be a bit of a drive.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
It'd be a schlep,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
but it'd be a watt to 50 for me to get to work.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
That's not bad.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
All right.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I played lots of stuff this week.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
So, some stuff out of the little game show thing.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
I played a brief demo.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
It was the E3 demo for Yiba Ninja Gaiden Z,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
which honestly plays just like Ninja Gaiden,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
except what's kind of cool is the zombies,

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
you can cut off their hands and stuff,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
and they turn into different weapons.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
So, like, I cut off some of the arms,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
and they turn into almost like a nunchuck.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
I managed to crash the demo at the end,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
because I was supposed to,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
there was supposed to be this zombie

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
that you throw into a car,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
and he's supposed to drive this truck into,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
like, this sex shop or whatever,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
and panties are supposed to fly out,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
because, you know, it's awesome.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
Instead, somehow, it let me kill the zombie,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
and then I couldn't finish the demo,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
which is kind of funny.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
But I've already seen how it ends, so,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
yeah, it wasn't that big a deal.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
And then I played a bit of Splinter Cell Conviction,

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
which, honestly, I have, or not Conviction,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Splinter Cell Blacklist, that's a new one.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Never really played a Splinter Cell game.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
It's kind of fun, you know, a self-action game.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
I do like the new little gimmick that they have in there,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
where you can mark different targets,

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
and then you do this, you hit a button to execute them,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
and then it does it, like, all cinematic,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and it's kind of neat.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Apparently, that's only available in the lower difficulties,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
which I was playing on Rookie,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
because I just didn't care.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
And, I don't know, it was a fun game.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Not one I'm probably going to pick up,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
because it's not my style of gameplay,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
but it looks good, so it was fun.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
What else?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I played more Super Meat Boy.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
I pretty much got all the A pluses for the first level.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
I'm working on the second level,

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
and that includes both the dark and light worlds,

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
and I got all of the bandages.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
So, then I have...

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Who did I unlock?

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I unlocked the robot from Macarium, I think,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
and then also...

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Oh, what's his name?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I don't even remember who it was.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Just a bunch of other characters.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Oh, the alien from Alien Hominid,

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
and some other character.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
I don't even know who it is.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
It's from some other indie game.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I'm trying to get the guy from Minecraft,

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
because he has the coolest kind of special attack.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
He can actually dig through the level.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Shadownextchan in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Loki, the mark and shoot mechanic,

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
was also in Splinter Cell Conviction.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
You should check it out.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Okay.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
And then, before the show,

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
I got sent the beta for Mercenary Kings,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
which is a game I backed on Kickstarter,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
and it's awesome.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
It looks very much like a...

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Like a Metal Slug, but it's not.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
You can craft weapons in the game,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
because you collect things.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
It's really hard,

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
and all really awesome hand-drawn pixel art.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
I don't know.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
I played it for about 15 minutes,

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
and it was pretty sweet.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
I never finished the first level,

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
because I had no fucking clue

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
where I was supposed to be going.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I was supposed to be rescuing one guy,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
and I went all through the level,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
because it kind of plays a little Metroidvania, I guess.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
They're very open levels,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
but since I have no map,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
or don't know where I'm supposed to be going,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I kind of wandered the level for a while,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
and couldn't find who I was supposed to be rescuing,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
because you have a time limit.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
But yeah, it looks awesome,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
and hopefully I get the full game pretty soon.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I know, I think the Shadowrun Returns game

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
should be coming out pretty soon.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I've got that, so I should be getting that,

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
and also Shadowrun Online,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
whenever the hell that comes out.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
So both of those.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I need to check on Shadowgate Returns.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
I know I backed that kick,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
so I've only backed two, maybe.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Oh, no, no, because there were the two recently,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
because we had them both on the network

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
that I backed.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
But then there was also,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
I'm starting to see the rewards for GamerCon,

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
or as they call it, GamerX,

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
is next weekend.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
That's actually happening,

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
which is pretty cool.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
So I'm just financing reaping the rewards of that.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
And then Shadowgate was the only other thing

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I've ever kickstarted

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
outside of the Professor Shy Guy thing.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
So I'm still waiting for that to come out,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
which I think is later this year,

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
so I'm excited about that.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Yeah, so I think that's all I played this week.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I wanted to play some other stuff.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I installed a few games.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
So, yeah, that's it.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Although there's going to be lots of taking up of time,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
so I don't know if I'll get into a lot of these games.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I just need to do the third.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Still have a few achievements left I need to get.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Okay.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
So my gaming week.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I've played quite a bit of different things,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
just kind of like a potpourri of stuff.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And I think not playing MMOs right now,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
because I'm kind of holding out.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
I know Final Fantasy XIV,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Realm Reborn is going to be the next big thing

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
I get sucked into,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
but it's not really out until mid-August,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
whenever the early launch

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
and the next beta phase happen and all that.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
So I'm kind of in this lull right now.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
World of Warcraft,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
most of my friends are on hiatus.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
They've either just gone off to play other things,

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
or they're going to play XIV,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
or they quit, or whatever.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
There's just not a lot of people still playing WoW.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
There's just a couple people I still run into,

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
but not a lot.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
So I sign into WoW maybe once every few days,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
play a PvP battleground,

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
try to talk to people,

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
but that's about it.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
So I've been using this time

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
to kind of catch up on single-player things

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
and Steam Sale, obviously,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
has been a huge contributor to that.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
The trading card metagame.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
I actually did my badge today for the summer sale,

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
so I got my summer sale badge,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
and it gave me a friends list boost to five people.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Not everybody would get that.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
That's just, I think you get a random loot.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
And I got a background for my profile,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
so now when you go visit my profile on Steam,

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
which is, I think, GreenSky42 is my external name,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
you can actually see my little trading card background.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
You know, just a silly thing.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
So, yeah, there was that.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Thanks to that, I kind of was playing some more games on Steam.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
A few things to note, Skyrim,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I started randomly playing the other night,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
because, you know, Skyrim is that game

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
you can just get sucked into.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Yeah, cards, partially cards.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I got all of my cards in one sitting.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
That'll tell you how I got sucked into Skyrim one night, right?

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
So there was that.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
But then the other game I got really sucked into,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Torchlight 2.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
I bought it.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I didn't play it, but I bought it.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
The last day of the sale is going on right now.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
If you're listening to the podcast, you probably missed it.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
But if you're listening live,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
that last day of the sale has all the encore sales going on right now,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
and I know Torchlight 2 is only five bucks.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
I already had the game, because I bought it when it first came out,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
but I played it for like a little bit, and then I just, you know,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
gamer ADD, I went and played something else.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
But I randomly decided to play it the other night to get trading cards,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
and I was doing a live stream of it,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
because I've been getting into live streaming more

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
on my personal Twitch channel, which is just Rob Roberts on Twitch.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I played some Torchlight 2 this week,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
and yeah, I played some more today,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
and my character's up to like level 18 or something,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
so good times.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Speaking of live streaming,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
after the show last week,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Shane made me play Slender the Eight Pages

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
and do a live stream.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Oh my god.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
That game was scary, but I beat his score.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
He's only got as far as two pages.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
I got to three pages, but by sheer dumb luck.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
And I live streamed the whole thing,

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
and I had the lights out, so like all you could see is my silhouette

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
and the lights from Alan's computer,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
because I had like my little webcam in the corner.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
It's all in the archive on my channel at Twitch TV, Rob Roberts.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
And I did have a jump screen,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
where I literally screamed once,

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
and Shane, I just, he started laughing,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
and then I bust up laughing. It was really funny.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
But it was scary, like I was in this like bathroom area

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
looking for a page, and I turned the corner,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
and he was right there, and the music did the

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
BONG, and like the tentacles were coming out and everything,

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
and I was like, ah! So I let out this big screech.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
So, that was fun.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
Even though, you know, I probably won't play that again anytime soon.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
But that was a good thrill for that.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I also bought Final Fantasy VII on the Steam sale,

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
because it was on the Flash sale yesterday for eight hours.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
It was eight bucks, and I bought it.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Not cheap enough yet.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Well, here's the thing. There's some things I like about it.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
Even though the music in its MIDI form is kind of,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
the graphics are improved.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
Like, I mean, I realize it's probably using a lot of

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
the same formulas from the PlayStation 1,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
but like, the polygons there, they look crisp.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Like, they look really good.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
But the whole cloud saving feature is busted.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
And I don't know if it's just because so many people bought it

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
when it went on the Flash sale yesterday,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
but like, I could not save my game yesterday.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
That's very frustrating and stupid.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Like, if the cloud thing doesn't work,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
the game should still let you save locally by default.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
But I could not save, and I streamed this whole thing happening.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I couldn't save to a local file.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
That's ridiculous. Come on.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
Like, I realize that Square's trying to tie everything together online

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
to do the boost level thing and everything,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
but it's ridiculous.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
It should always save locally, and then to the cloud.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Yes, right?

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
So I have to really dog Final Fantasy VII for that cloud saving thing,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
because it does more harm than good in this case.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
I'm hoping they fix it, but it did not leave a good impression.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
Like, who wants to replay the first hour of the game again, you know?

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
I mean, well, I guess I did play it for the first time,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
but like, the first time in a few years.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Not the first time since yesterday.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
Jason in our chat room, vxjasonxv at live.hognetwork.com says,

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
Cloud can't save Aeris. You expect him to save your game?

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
Lol. I would hope.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
My cloud would have stabbed her.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Let's see. I'm also looking here.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Tigerclaw says, Rob needs to play more scary games on Twitch.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It's a possibility. It's a possibility.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
I'm trying to play a variety of things. Just sometimes classic things.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Too bad you don't have the Oculus Rift and then play like a Slender game.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
No!

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
You know what, by the way, Rob?

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
I did remember one other video game related thing we did last night.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
We watched the live stream of video games live.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Oh yeah, I saw part of that.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
It was pretty good.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I decided to stream at the same time it was on,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
which is probably why nobody was watching.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I'm amused by David Hader's ponytail.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Nice.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
Let's see, Ragenator says, speaking of streaming on Twitch, etc.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
How would a total newbie like me stream on a site like that?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
It's actually not too difficult.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
The program I use, which is great, is Open Broadcast Software?

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Open Broadcaster Source?

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
I use FFSplit.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Do you?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Oh, no. I like Open Broadcaster.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Look that one up because that one's great.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
I remember what I used because my computer had the format of the hard drive,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
so I don't have my program anymore.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
FFSplit, I did not get as good a performance out of that as I did.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I mean, it's nice because that's free and everything,

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
but I got a better performance out of OBS.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Let's see, also trying to read through our chat room real quick

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
at live.vognetwork.com.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I guess that's it for now for chat comments,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
but we'll get some more of these later.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
Some folks commenting on a story that's coming up.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
But I think I got everything in my gaming week.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Oh, one other thing I should throw out there.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
On the Wii U this week, and I'm spoiling the news a little bit,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
but it's my own story.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Earthbound was out on the Wii U this week.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I played a bit of that on Virtual Console.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
It's nice to revisit that game after a very long time.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
I played it on emulators once, like years ago,

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
but to be able to play it again on the TV and on the little game pad

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
is a nice experience.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
That is a great, great RPG, one of my all-time favorites.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
It really is.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
I know Bobby's been razzing me a little bit

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
about the whole Super Metroid versus Earthbound thing,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
but I'm always kind of like,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
but Earthbound really is a really good game,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
and I don't find Earthbound to be overrated.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
It's not my favorite game, but it's probably in my top five, honestly.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I love Earthbound. It's great.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
So, glad to be playing that again.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
And glad to hear they didn't really change a lot.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
The changes they made, very minor stuff.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
They made one dialogue change,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
and I don't even think it was that big a deal,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
but they changed some of the graphic effects

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
to tone down the amazing seizure displays that some of the PSI effects had.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
You mean the embryos?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Hmm?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
You mean the embryos?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah, right.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
So, yeah, good times.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
Okay, so that's it for our Gaming Weeks.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
Quick housekeeping, twitter.com, excuse me, twitter.com slash OLR,

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
or facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio if you want to follow us.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
And of course, do support the other shows we have

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
vog network dot com.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I do not, and this is going to be news to you guys,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
so sorry to spring this on you mid-show.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
We will not be here in two weeks,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
because I'm going to be at that convention in San Francisco.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
I won't be back in time.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
So, because Sunday's the last day.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
So, sorry.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Okay.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Sorry about it.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
No show in two weeks.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Surprise.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Well, maybe, I don't, I don't,

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
keep that flexible, because maybe I'll be back early enough,

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
or we can do something a little later or something,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
but I just, yeah.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I totally want to take over the stream and do a fuck-off show.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Yeah, do whatever you want.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
It's called Jamie Rants.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Or do a live stream.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Loki can play Borderlands whenever, so.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
I'm not playing Borderlands.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
I'm hoping I can do some fun stuff at the convention,

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
and I'm going to be seeing a lot of my podcast pals from like,

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
well, we're all doing that panel, which I should obviously be plugging, duh.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Saturday night, and I believe six o'clock, is Podcast Cross Zone.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
It's OLR, me.

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
It's Koopa Club, our friends from Chicago,

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
and I believe Long Beach is where one of their hosts lives.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Game Buoy, Game Bar, and more.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Special surprise guest, hopefully, all talking about podcasting,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
and kind of our own shows,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
and trying to enable other people to do their own shows,

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
and enable more broadcasters.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
It is a GLBT-focused convention, obviously,

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
but we're really about everybody, you know, having a voice.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Good times.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
Alright, let's get into some news.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Loki.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Yes, Pokemon Rumble.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
I'm actually kind of surprised that this is coming out still digitally,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
but Pokemon Rumble was a game that came out in Japan,

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
I think earlier last year, maybe this year.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
It was a digital download for the Wii U,

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
and what makes it kind of unique is it was sort of going the Skylanders route,

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
where you have these physical figurines that you buy for a certain amount of money,

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
and you, I think you put them on the, I don't know if it's,

40:43.000 --> 40:49.000
I want to say it was the Near Field Communication part of the Wii U tablet,

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
or the game pad, or whatever, and it interacted with that.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
So, it is coming out over here in North America, August 29th.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
18 figurines.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
However, they are sold exclusively at Evil-G,

41:04.000 --> 41:13.000
so if you watch your Pokemon, you know, Nintendo has still made this blood pack with Evil-G to do that.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
The game, I guess, is 18 bucks in the eShop.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Each figurine is going to be $4.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
I don't know.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Neat.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I, uh, why not?

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
Except for the fact that it's a GameStop exclusive, but something to hold us over until X and Y, right?

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Europe is also going to be getting the game August 15th.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
No words on how they're going to, if that's going to be done through GameStop in Europe as well.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
I don't know.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
But, it's kind of lame.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
I don't know.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I just don't understand why they're making, I mean, I understand they're a big company,

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
but why exclusive through GameStop to do this stuff?

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
I don't know why they would do that.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
I mean, because honestly, I think everybody could sell those stupid figurines.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Hell, they put it on the game as, like, a disc.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I'm surprised they didn't do that in the first place.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
$20 game, you know?

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
Yeah, especially because Nintendo puts a lot of stuff on disc.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
Yeah, put it in a $20 game, maybe bundle it with a figurine or something like that, and there you go.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Super Luigi U is on disc, right?

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
It will be.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Anyway.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Alright, well, more Nintendo news.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
I mentioned this, obviously, during my gaming week, but I want to officially acknowledge

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
EarthBound is finally out on the Virtual Console.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
It's only available on Wii U, however, so you can't get it on 3DS, you can't get it on the Wii,

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
which sadly makes sense because Nintendo's trying to push people to the Wii U,

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
and there are people crazy enough to buy a Wii U to play EarthBound.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
But you can play it at my house.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
Especially considering how much those cartridges go for on eBay, you know?

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Yeah, I won't tell you how cheap we got ours.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
Well, you might have got lucky, too. Did you find it at a...

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
It was a long time ago.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Yeah, before the value...

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Probably when we had the video game store.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
So, anyway, this is out.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
There was a special Nintendo Direct to go with it.

42:59.000 --> 43:05.000
Some people taking surprise at the increased price because the game is $9.99 on the Wii U eShop.

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
It is not the normal, I'm using my quotey fingers, price of $7.99.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
But to be honest, this isn't the first time we've seen a game priced higher than the bar.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
I believe Mario 2 loss levels, or what they...

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
Super Mario 2, the Japanese version, was a dollar more than most NES games.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
Because on the Wii, they did this whole week of import releases.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
And, you know, Mario 2 is the big flagship of those, the original one.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
And that was a dollar more.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
The Final Fantasy games, I think, at least the Super Nintendo ones that they put out on Virtual Console,

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
those were a dollar, or maybe even two dollars more. I think they were a dollar more.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Squeenix tax.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Yeah, basically. Well, now this is, you know, Nintendo tax.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Both.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
Well, so why are they charging the increased price? Because they can, honestly.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
I mean...

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
Gotta make up that game some exclusive money somewhere.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
I guess so. I mean, it's not like $9.99 is a ripoff,

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
but they are talking about that there's an enhanced value about the Earthbound Strategy Guide,

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
which is out there, and it's enhanced for the Wii U gamepad,

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
and you can actually view it on Nintendo's Earthbound site.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
Which, you know, you press the little home button, go into the browser, and you can open up on the site.

44:17.000 --> 44:23.000
I'm gonna be honest. I find that feature, and I'm using my quotey fingers,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
I find that feature to be a little bit disingenuous.

44:25.000 --> 44:32.000
I don't think that's really a feature, because you're just advertising a website, basically.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
And to be honest, I could open up my internet browser and go to gamefacts.com

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
and pull up almost anything that's on Virtual Console.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
I mean, I can do that.

44:41.000 --> 44:48.000
That's cool that Nintendo did the optimized and scanned it in and made that or whatever,

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
but you technically don't have to own Earthbound to see that.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
You know what I mean? That's not really value for buying the game.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
So if you're gonna tell me that the $2 was for that, I'm gonna tell you that's a crock of shit.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
Because that would be like me saying,

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
Oh, well, with every copy of Donkey Kong sold on the Virtual Console, you get a free voggenetwork.com.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Check it out.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
It doesn't quite work for me.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
I mean, cool. It would be neat if Nintendo would do more manuals and stuff,

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
but you know what would be even better is if instead of having to press the home button,

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
having to press the internet browser button, having to enter in earthbound.nintendo.com,

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
having to wait for the thing to load. You know what would be even better than that?

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
Just tapping the screen and having an extra button that says guide and then it just comes right up.

45:42.000 --> 45:47.000
It's already downloaded to your Wii U. It's just right there. Instant.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
No, it's even better.

45:49.000 --> 45:55.000
That would again require Nintendo to get online and speed some things up a little bit.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
I guess this is a baby step.

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
Did you know with your copy of Balloon Fight that you can actually get a free copy of Pornhub?

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
Free porn. With a Nintendo title. I mean, that's ridiculous.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
But it's optimized.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
Shadownextgen in chat at live.voggenetwork.com says,

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
The guide from Nintendo would most likely be better than what you will find on Game Facts.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
No.

46:21.000 --> 46:27.000
Graphically, yes. For the retro-minded in you, yes.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
You know, again, for the whole tickling your retro tastes or whatever, yes.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
But Game Facts will honestly be faster. That site was slow as hell when I was playing with it.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
It's probably outsourced anyway, so it's probably going to be a Prima guide or something.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
But...

46:43.000 --> 46:50.000
No, no. Well, I mean, this was years ago, but every copy of Earthbound, when you bought it, it came in that bigger box.

46:50.000 --> 46:56.000
I believe, I could be wrong, I believe it was a whole thing tied in to push Nintendo Power subscriptions.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
Because, remember how Nintendo Power would do those guides?

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
If there was one for Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, I could be wrong.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Mario Paint.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
But I thought Earthbound was technically one of those guides.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
And that there were things in there to try to get you to get a Nintendo Power subscription.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
I had the Mario Paint one, that was freaking sweet.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
I'm having to think back almost 20 years here, but...

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Anyhow.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Yeah, all sorts of pixel art in there for doing animated Yoshis and all sorts of fun stuff.

47:24.000 --> 47:31.000
AlphaKnanogram says, the online US guide sucks, the Nintendo Europe site has the PDF to download.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
And you put it on your iPad.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
That's honestly how I've been doing a lot of playthroughs.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
Not just Nintendo, but even 360 and Playstation 3 as well.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I pull up the thing on my iPad.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Works great.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
And BlackWolf says, it was a Nintendo guide, not a Prima guide.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Could have still been outsourced though.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
It didn't necessarily have to come in internally from Nintendo.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
But they had the hotline, didn't they?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Oh, they still did at that time, yeah.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
Oh yeah, the game counselors, absolutely.

48:09.000 --> 48:16.000
To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, thunder.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Moving on, DarkSakura.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Yes, we do have some other news.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
I'm sorry, I've been discussing certain old Exedy games with somebody.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
Exedy games? That's really old.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
Like Gorf? Wasn't Gorf an Exedy game?

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
Well, I'll go ahead and say it, but I won't say who I've been talking with or the reason why.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Yeah, yeah.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Venture.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Oh, yeah, you brought that up on the show before.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
I think I've done Venture as a classic. If I haven't, I should.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
I think you have.

48:45.000 --> 48:54.000
Anyway, speaking of classic games, everybody has been messaging me this to show Dan, and Dan knows. Trust me.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Of course Dan knows.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Of course Dan knows.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
It's nice that people think of you, though.

48:58.000 --> 49:06.000
Thank you, everybody. But keep in mind, Dan used to run a site called Neo Strider's Strider Zone.

49:06.000 --> 49:12.000
And it was one of two Strider sites that existed back in the days when people had websites on AOL.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
He was probably sitting there, all of a sudden the hair on his arm went up. He's like, Strider news has been announced.

49:16.000 --> 49:25.000
He turned red in the face, and like all of a sudden weird signals came from his head where he started accepting the vibe of Strider.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Did he cry?

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
As it flowed.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Did he cry? Was there a little shaking?

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I think he peed a little.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
Which I'm glad that he's not listening right now, so I love you, Dan.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
What other embarrassing Dan stories do you want to tell?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Love you, mean it.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
I did say that I was going to clone his liver and sell multiple copies on eBay.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Because livers are worth the money, man.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
I told him if he ever pissed me off, I'd punch him until he peed blood.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
You make that threat of a lot of people, though.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
I do.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
You can't just throw that around willy-nilly.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
I only do that to people I care about. Rob, by the way.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Hey.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
Anyway, so yeah, I mentioned Strider. It is Strider.

50:03.000 --> 50:11.000
There is a version of Strider which is supposed to be a series reboot, from what I understand, like a redoing of the first game.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
From what we could see of the trailer, it looked like the whole first level.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
And it's being done by Double Helix, who is also working on Killer Instinct, so I don't know.

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
This looks like it would be a lot better than that Killer Instinct thing, so I have some high hopes.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
Watching the gameplay, it was really, really cool.

50:32.000 --> 50:37.000
He doesn't so much walk as Dash everywhere he goes. He runs with purpose.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
Keep in mind, I loved Strider 2. I loved the updated thing.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
I loved every appearance of Strider Hear You in Marvel vs. Capcom.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
The various Marvel vs. Capcom's when he was playable.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
And one of my favorite characters of all time, thanks to Dan, making me sit down and said,

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Any person I marry is going to beat Strider.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
On Genesis.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Which I have.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
And finally beaten on arcade and beaten PlayStation version, blah, blah, blah.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
And that last fight with the stupid master is bitch.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
It's a pain in the ass.

51:09.000 --> 51:17.000
But anyway, so yeah, we both have a lot of happy going on in our house because of Strider.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Do you even love Strider on the NES?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I'm going to tell you about Strider on the NES.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
It's based off the manga.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
So it is not the arcade game.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
It's got this one jump that's like freaking impossible.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
I think we own the game and I think Dan kind of likes it.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
The infamous triangle jump.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
The triangle jump, yes.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
I do like the story in the game. I've read the manga.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
I don't like playing it.

51:44.000 --> 51:49.000
So I would much rather play the original Strider any day.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
I loved Strider on the NES.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Because I didn't have a Genesis.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
We weren't really a Sega household.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
We were all Nintendo.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
So I played Strider on the NES.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
I really liked it.

51:58.000 --> 52:03.000
And hearing that this new game is kind of Metroidvania-ish made me think of the NES version.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
Not that the NES was really Metroidvania, but it had like the different stages.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
The Nintendo Strider, I'm almost positive, was the same engine that DuckTales used.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Because they were very similar where you would select a stage.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Like you would go to the various areas.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
And then, you know, you clear that.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
Well, and other games use that same formula too.

52:22.000 --> 52:31.000
But my big thing is that I just didn't enjoy playing it as much as I did the original.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
And keep in mind, I didn't grow up with a Genesis.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I played Strider in the arcade a couple of times.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
And it wasn't really my thing.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
And I didn't play it on Nintendo.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
But like I said, Dan sat me down and said,

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Any woman I marry is going to play Strider.

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
So I've beaten Ghosts N Goblins 2, which made me want to cry tears of blood.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
But Strider, at least, is a fun game.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
And, you know, he actually told me a little bit of trivia about that too.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Is that it was going to be a regular cartridge.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
But because they wanted to put the Amazon level in it,

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
They actually upped the memory in it.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
So they could include the Amazon level and have the music and everything.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Nice.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Yeah. So.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
So this news fills a certain hole in your heart that not even Moon Diver could fill, right?

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
Moon Diver was a good game.

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
I mean, it's a spiritual successor in the series.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
But we need to have Strider.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
No one.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
And what I'm kind of hoping is that with this we get some of the elements from Strider 2.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Like we see Hien.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
You know, because I actually really like to play through the game with Hien.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
That was really fun.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
The guy who had two cyphers.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
It was really cool.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
But I have high hopes for this.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
It looks pretty. It looks like it plays solidly.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
The backgrounds were amazing. The music was amazing.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
And it was the same first level that I heard.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
So I will keep my fingers crossed.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
A lot of people have been frowning a little bit hearing who's developing this.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
Because, you know, the new Killer Instinct game.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
Which I don't know. I mean, it's hard to judge a game that's not even out.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
I don't know.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
But Silent Hill Homecoming has a lot of people kind of nervous.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
But, you know, I don't know if it's...

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
We really have to wait until the game's out.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
I mean, WayForward does a lot of great retro updates now.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Dude, they made Ping Pals if I remember right.

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
So that game was literally the worst handheld game in history.

54:21.000 --> 54:27.000
So if, you know, that company can do better after their first couple attempts.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
I'm willing to give these guys a chance.

54:29.000 --> 54:35.000
And, like I said, I looked at the trailer and it really would be hard to screw up Strider.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
Unless there were major timing and physics issues.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
Other than that, it really looked very solid.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
And all they have to do is take the timing physics from the original.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
And they would know exactly how to do it.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
And, you know, like I said, I've played other versions of Strider.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
We actually have the PC Engine version.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
Which we can't play because we don't have the card for it.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
The arcade card.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
But that one even...

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
I don't think it would be too hard. I really don't think it would be too hard.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
They'd have to really screw up, like I said, timing and physics to ruin the game.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
Or, you know, maybe really shitty voice acting.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Which, it can't get...

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Even the first game actually had pretty...

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
The original had pretty decent voice acting in it.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
It was all in whatever the native language of whoever the character was.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
But it has the best line in it.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I gotcha.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
The one guy.

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
And the new one's like, I'm Strider! I wanna hit you with my sword!

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
They'd be like, Hi! I hear you!

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Wow.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
They better give him the uber-bishy voice, you know?

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
I'm surprised they waited to announce this for Comic-Con.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
That they didn't bring this out at E3.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I mean, maybe it just wasn't ready, but...

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
It's one of the games that the fans have been dying to get a new game of...

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
Sorry Mega Man! You guys fucking suck!

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
Hey! Enjoy the Game Boy games on 3DS!

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
The Mega Man thing I think is fight now.

56:01.000 --> 56:07.000
But I'm actually a little bit more excited about Strider than I am about a Mega Man game, so...

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
I think a Mega Man project's in the works.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
But I think with this Strider news and so forth, and Mega Man and Smash...

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
I think there'll be something next year.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
But, I mean, easy to say, right?

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Any strange analyst can say that.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Alright, let's move on. Loki.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
You'll be really awesome as if they do a new Mega Man game that's done by...

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
Was it WayForward, actually? I think.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
There were comments to that in the chatroom, too.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
It'll suck, whatever it is, I'm sure. They can't do it.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
If the DuckTales thing goes well, you never know.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
That looks cool.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Anyways, so NCAA. There was a bit of drama with that.

56:45.000 --> 56:52.000
Considering that the game just came out, apparently NCAA is not renewing its contract with EA.

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
This'll be, I guess, the last year that it'll be called NCAA Football 14.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
However, and I know they have a lawsuit against them.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
And this is from 2008.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
Basically saying that...

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
I want to say it was because they're using the...

57:09.000 --> 57:16.000
They've never licensed the use of current student athlete names, images, or likenesses.

57:16.000 --> 57:24.000
I think the whole reason that they're not renewing their contract with them is they're trying to distance themselves from EA.

57:24.000 --> 57:29.000
Because EA is kind of going around them and putting these students in the game.

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
And I guess EA is still going to be making college football games.

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
It'll just probably be called EA Sports College Football 15 next year or something like that.

57:40.000 --> 57:49.000
And, of course, you know, they're just saying that, once again, even some attorneys that are dealing with the whole lawsuit are saying,

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
yeah, it's basically...

57:51.000 --> 58:00.000
The announcement makes it plain that NCAA is attempting to mitigate the damages by ducking its responsibilities.

58:00.000 --> 58:13.000
They say that our suit illustrates the cabal between NCAA and EA has exploited student athletes for years using their images in video games without compensation.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Well, that sounds like EA.

58:14.000 --> 58:26.000
While we are heartened that they've stopped the practice, we believe that they owe students or student athletes a great deal more than implied promise to stop stealing their images.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
So how's that going to work next year? Are they actually going to stop using the student images?

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
So it's just going to be like generic people on a team type thing?

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Are we going like EA Sports Tech Mobile here?

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I mean, how's that going to work?

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
So I don't know.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Whatever.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
And I even read in chat or something that they were saying that next year is going to be all next gen anyways.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
No current gen version of the game.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
Could be a chance to kind of re reboot, reinvent things.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
It's interesting to see if 2K comes back with a college football game.

58:59.000 --> 59:11.000
Although the last one was that remember how they tried to do that whole American football or I forget what their one had like this weird like lineup of people in there and stuff and fake teams and stuff.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
And that didn't work out too well.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
But it'd be kind of neat to see 2K come back and do new.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
How important is it to have the actual people in the game?

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
I mean, I don't play a whole lot of sports games, but it's never really mattered to me.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Yeah, the games I played games.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
So, you know, you want to play as your favorite players and stuff.

59:29.000 --> 59:35.000
And so which I really, I realized the NCAA games didn't actually have the player.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
Well, I mean, they were all there except in name.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
I mean, that's that's what it was, right?

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
Like their stats were what you would expect to see.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
Their looks were what you would expect to see, you know, with subtle changes.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Just the names weren't there, you know?

59:48.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Yeah, I think it's just they want, you know, they just like, you know, if you're playing an NBA game, you'd want to have, you know, they pay those players to use their likenesses and stuff in the game.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
So the thing is, why aren't they paying these college students?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Because they think they can get away with it.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Oh, what's a college student going to do?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Try to sue me?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
You're broke.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I mean, seriously.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Well, they can't they can't profit.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It's NCAA regulations that they can't.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
NCAA is saying that they never license that stuff to them.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:22.000
They're basically saying, oh, well, we didn't do this, but they're still getting this stuff in the game anyway.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Well, Bobby and Chad wants to clarify.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Bobby Black Wolf says they only lost the NCAA name.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Nothing else.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
The colleges and bowls and stadiums and stuff are still EA.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The only thing they lost is the NCAA name and the NCAA logo.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
That's it.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Well, then that won't affect anything.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
You don't think?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I don't think.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I don't think it'll be a big deal either.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I think at the end of the day, a good game is a good game.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Like I love Tecmo Bowl is like my favorite football game.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And it didn't really have any of that.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So, you know, anyhow.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Moving on.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Lots of gaming things being shown at Comic-Con.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Now, I know gaming kind of comes up every year at Comic-Con.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
But it definitely seems like there's more of it this year than we usually see.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And that probably has something to do with the fact that we have new consoles coming this year.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
So obviously the companies want to push that to the potential buying audience of which a lot of them are at Comic-Con right now.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Although I'm not there.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
But Sony is at Comic-Con with the PlayStation 4.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:26.000
They have NAC and Drive Club out there open for play, letting the public experience PlayStation 4.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I think it would be a safe bet to say those games will show up.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Everything you're hearing here, these games will get in a truck and move to PAX in a couple weeks.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Absolutely.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Octodad, excuse me, I guess is part of PlayStation 4 as well.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Gran Turismo 6 is also there even though technically that's not next gen.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It's still there.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It still looks nice.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yeah.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Microsoft has Rise with the Y, Rise and Killer Instinct out there on the floor.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Killer Instinct drawing pretty good.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Apparently Rise is too.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Apparently other games being shown out there, Dead Rising 3, Assassin's Creed 4, and Watch Dogs.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
All there at Comic-Con.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
That's just a taste.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
That's just some of the stuff that involves next gen and the big companies.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
So is there any comics to be found at Comic-Con out of curiosity?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Marvel's got a whole big thing.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
No, I know.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Well, you know, they actually did announce the next Avengers movie.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Yeah, but that's a movie.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It's not a comic.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Yeah, but it's still Marvel.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And why are they fucking going with Age of Ultron?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Sorry.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Not a fan?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I'm not a fan of Ultron.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And they're doing the same thing in the comics.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
They tease Thanos.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So here I go talking about movies on the video game podcast.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Sorry.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I went to go see This is the End last night.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It was funny.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It was one of those movies that was so stupid.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
It's seriously stupid.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It was awesome.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
But to the point where it's actually really funny.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
It's so stupid you can't help but laugh.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Like a lot of stoner comedies are.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It was great.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah, I had a good time. It was good.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
But I got home.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
In the first news that greets me when I yell,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
the Superman sequel will have Batman in it.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
They're doing the Superman vs. Batman thing that was in one of the comics.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I'm just like,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
stop.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Stop.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And I know this is a whole

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
to build up to the Justice League movie

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
that they have to do.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Because Marvel's got the Avengers.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
So now DC's got to do this.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
But it's like, no.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
No. You do not get to do

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
a Justice League movie

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
until you fucking do a Wonder Woman movie.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
You don't get to debut her.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
No. She needs her own movie.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
And it needs to be good. Because if it sucks,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
you don't get to do a Justice League movie.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And I don't.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
God, the whole idea of Batman and Superman is just.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I don't. I don't like that.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I don't know. Like, I get that it's based on a comic

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and it was a real thing and everything, but I don't know.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Maybe there's just that part of me that holds out hope

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
for a fourth Bale Batman movie,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
which I realize they probably couldn't

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
do because of the story and everything, but

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
dammit, there's always a way.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
There's always a way. I want to see a

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
sequel to Suburban Commando, but instead

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
of having Hulk Hogan in the movie, it'll be

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Christian Bale Batman, and he'll be like

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
going around the neighborhood driving a car.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Just a regular car. Not the Batmobile. Just like

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
calling the people. You know, that'd be fun.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Maybe babysitting some

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
kids.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
There's

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
some Marvel versus DC chat

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
going on in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And all the Marvel people are right.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Brad from Pod Culture says,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
you should ask if any good comics are there. Who reads

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Marvel? People with taste.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Snap.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Slidekick says, I've always preferred Marvel

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
for superheroes. People, please.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
There's good and bad on

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
both sides. There's good and bad on

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
both sides. Yes, check out Rocket Raccoon.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It's all about image, anyways.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I will say,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I don't watch a lot of

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
TV, although

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I have been watching Orange is the New Black based on

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Recommendation, that Netflix show, but

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I'm stupid looking forward to

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. TV show.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yeah, me too. I think it's kind of rad that

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
they're doing this big budget TV show.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I'm still super pissed off that there is

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
still not AKA Jessica Jones.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
You heard at Comic-Con,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I don't know, I guess there was

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
a panel or something with David Covington

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and the whole X-Files crew and stuff, but he wants to

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
bring that back. I'm like, yes.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Please. That would be fantastic.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I still haven't seen the second movie, which I hear

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
is really dumb, but

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I would love to have them just

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
bring it back. I mean, they're both not really fucking

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
doing anything. I mean, just bring back

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
a whole new series and just set it

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
20 years later and

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
pick it up from where it, you know,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
where it left off. That'd be fantastic.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Alright.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Let's move on with more news.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Classic game of the week,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
still a little bit away, and release date's coming up

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
right after this. TarSaga.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Ready to friend some butt?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
What? I explained that to Dan, by the way.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
He's like, you guys are weird.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So Nintendo has trademarked

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
two game names that

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
will really do hint to

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Seaman.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
They have

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
the rights to Mysterious Pet

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Legend of the Fish with a Human Face

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and Mysterious Partner

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Legend of the Fish with a Human Face.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And it was

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
registered in

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Japan. It was

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
now, there have been

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
some goings

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
on with the creator of

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Seaman, who is Yut Saito,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
who did work with

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Nintendo

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
for GameCube content. That was a

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
pinball game,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Odama, and

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
the Guild 101

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
thing,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Air Reporter. So

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
it could be possible that we may be seeing

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
another Seaman. They'd have to put out

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
a micro, well, I guess the microphone's already built into the

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
controller, so who knows?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
On both the 3DS and

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
on the, well,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
3DSDS and

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Wii U.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I will not friend his butt, and actually it doesn't sound

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
very exciting, but

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
sure, why not?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I think that butt friending should be

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
a thing.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Click to butt friend. I think there's a lot

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
of people that don't get that joke, and I'm trying

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
to find that original YouTube.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Yeah, that was a while back.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Was it a Let's Play? That was a long time ago.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Some dude doing a Let's Play with that

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
game, Seaman. Yeah.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I think it was, like,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Seaman gameplay, or, yeah, Let's

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Play.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I'm assuming Tigerclaw could probably find

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
it, because he could find it. Yeah, Tigerclaw, do your job.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Find us the link.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Hopefully. Friend his butt for us.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Let me Tigerclaw that for you.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
It was, like, asking

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
about birthdays, and it was like,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
are we friends?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I'll friend your butt.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Wait, wait.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I might have found it.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I might have beat Tigerclaw out of this.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
That's it.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Okay, wait.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Let me give credit where credit is due.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Oh, gotta love this

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
username. Ebola World

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
is the user that did this.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
You just need to click like.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So, what

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
month is your birthday in?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
October.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
You were born in October?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
No, it doesn't.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Let's try that again.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
In what month

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
were you

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
born?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
October.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
You were born in October?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yes.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I wonder if people would say you're a

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
trick, or a treat?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Treat.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Like

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
the spice?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Yes.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Well, you can

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
look, but don't touch.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I don't want to touch

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
you.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
What

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
do you want?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
To touch you.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I don't know that word.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
You just said it.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So, what day is your

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
birthday on?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
The second.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
The second?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Yes, bitch.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Mahatma Gandhi was also

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
born on October 2nd.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
This honestly sounds like me talking to

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Siri.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I hope you are as peaceful as he.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I would loathe

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
to be stuck in here with

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
an aggressive human being.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Fuck you.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Listen, I

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
don't know if our relationship

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
can handle

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
this, you know?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Besides, what would the neighbors think?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Fuck them.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Fuck them.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Hey, why all the noise?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Your mama.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
What?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Your mama.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Mama?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Nope,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I'm just fine.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Wait.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Sorry, I'm busy.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
You don't look busy.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I'll friend your butt.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Are you coming

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
on to me?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
There, there it is.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Two minutes

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and thirty seconds later. Again, credit to

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
YouTube user EbolaWorld for that.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Totally just stole that there. But that's where that

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
joke comes from, the whole I'll friend your butt thing, which

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
is great. So, lots of

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
let's plays, I'm sure, coming.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
If this happens to be true, which I kind of

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
hope it is, that would be great.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
You know, we actually did

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
play the game to completion

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and set our little frogman free.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And then Dan's like,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I wonder if he's still there.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Well, our

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
we still have our save files intact.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
So. Nice.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
out some release dates of some games coming

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
out a lot sooner than any

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
C-Man reboot.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
You know, we could

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
definitely use a C-Man

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
reboot this week because all we have is

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
the Smurfs 2.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
The official game.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Let's check Boogaloo.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
You said Wii-Wii.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I said Wii-Wii U.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Alright, then I guess we travel to Japan.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
That was quick. Looking at some of the

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
release dates in Japan. On the PlayStation 3

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
this week, quite a bit actually,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Dragon's Crown, Ketsuie,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Kizuna, Jigoko Tachi Extra

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
in regular and limited edition.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Majo Tohai Kihei comes out

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
as well in regular and limited.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Also, Race Driver Grid 2 and

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
X-Blade Code Embryo.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And, Zone of the Enders HD

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
edition gets a price reduction this week.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
So. Lots and lots

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
of releases there.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Also, going to

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
on the Xbox 360

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I don't think there's

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
really anything

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
on the 360. I mean, what did you expect?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Haha. Also, looking at

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
the PlayStation Vita.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Let's see. Dragon's Crown

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
as well as

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
X-Blaze Code Embryo.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Next Rev Aiken

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
and Dragon's Crown Famitsu

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
pack. Like a Famitsu edition

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
on the PlayStation Vita this week.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
And,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
looking at the, let's see

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
on the Wii U. The Wii U does

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
have Lego City Undercover, getting its Japanese

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
release this week. And, also

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
a new GamePad battery pack

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
which I think was reported on a couple weeks ago. That is

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
actually getting its release in Japan this week

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
as far as peripherals go.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Going to the 3DS.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Gaikuten Saiban

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
5 is finally released

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
from Capcom. And, that

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
is the Phoenix Wright game, basically.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
That's the one with Apollo and all the

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
folks in it. Is that the one that's rated

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
M, I think I heard?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I don't think so.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
For its release over here.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Well, anyway, that is out

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
in Japan this week and there's a whole lot of peripherals

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
to come with that. Fantasy Life

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Link and Chibi Devil 2

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Mahou no Yume Ihon.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
To.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Is that? No.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
No, not To.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Beast Saga Saikyuu

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Gekutosu Coliseum

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
comes out on the 3DS this week.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
It's a busy week in Japan. That's interesting.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Why? Hmm. Now, I've seen

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
that before somewhere, but I don't know.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And lastly, yes, there are still

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
PCP, or, PCP,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
PSP games coming.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Daya no Kuni no Alice

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Wonderful Mirror World. I wonder if that's

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
based off Alice in Wonderland type of game.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I'm sure it is. Or, Through the Looking Glass.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Like an anime to, oh yeah, see, look.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
The Mad Hatter is a

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
sexy thing. That's the March Hare.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Well, the Mad Hatter is right behind him.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
They're all sexy.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Like, you know,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
anime style. And, Toki no

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Keizuna Hanomisubi

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Tezuri comes out in regular and

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
limited edition. And there's a twin pack as well.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Lots of games.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Not so many for the UK.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
On the 22nd, we have RuneScape 3

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
for PC. On the 25th,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I have no idea how this

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
is supposed to say.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Rimmed Capsule. Is that it?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Rimmed Capsule on iPad, Android, and iPhone.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Shadowrun Returns for iPad,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Android, Mac, and PC.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
And on the 26th, we have Pikmin 3 for Wii U.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
It's over.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Nothing else.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
than the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Okay, this is kind of ridiculous.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
You know,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
a lot of people

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
would say that the Xbox One

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
might be a little rushed, or even some of these

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
next gen systems. But,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
there was some

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
news that came out

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
regarding Forza Motorsport 5.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Saying that the game was

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
going to require a one-time

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
download before it can be played.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And that they were basically

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
um, it's such

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
a crunch for

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
you know, time, that

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
they were putting the base,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
you know, kind of the framework of the game together,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
they're getting that press to disk, and then

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
they were going to be working

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
on the tracks

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
up until launch.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And so basically, you would

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
have to buy the game,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and then you'd have to download the rest

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
um, you know,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
when you first put the game in the system.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
So you would need to be connected to the internet.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Now,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
of course, there's been some back and forth

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
about it. They said, you know, I guess

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Turn 10's Dan Greenwald,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
he changed his statement

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
saying that

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
the requirement

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
of a connection to Xbox Live before

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
playing is not the plan.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
However, when or if the game requires

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
an internet connection for

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
single player content, it's still not clear.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So...

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I don't know. Is that how they were gonna

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I mean, that is getting ridiculous.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
You know, now where these games ship

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
and there's not a whole ton of testing, and then they have

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
this day one patch or whatever that fixes some

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
bugs, which is fine. I understand that

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I appreciate there is bug fixing being

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
done between, you know, mastering the disk

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
and actually launching it and stuff, but

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
when you get to the point where the game is

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
literally not done, it is

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
admitted to be

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
it is not done. The game is

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
not done, and now

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
they need to put it on

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
disk so that, you know,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
you download the rest of the content later because

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
they want to hit that launch

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
window or whatever.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
That's ridiculous. That is

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
absolutely ridiculous, and I'm sorry.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I just...

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Is this why they wanted this whole digital

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
system in the first place, is so that

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
they could literally, you know,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
ship unfinished products, but hey, whatever

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
you just download the rest later.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Is that how it's supposed to work?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Because what if you don't have an internet connection?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
The game is fucking useless. Are they gonna advertise

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
this on the box that the game is gonna require

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
a, you know,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
a connection to download the thing?

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
What's the point? I just don't understand.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
That really sucks

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
for those people that don't

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
have the internet connection, which was a big

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
part of the push to get Xbox One

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
to reverse their policies to begin with. And it's not even

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
the internet connection thing. Let's just skip

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
the whole, like, people that don't have internet,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
okay? Because a lot of people do have internet.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
It's still gonna take

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
a long time to download the rest of the content

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
for that game. I mean,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
you know DLC and stuff that includes

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
like actual new art assets

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
and stuff, or at least a few hundred

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
meg. And when you're talking that, you

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
know, let's just assume that

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
the majority of the tracks aren't on the game.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
You're talking like a multi-gig

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
download that even on

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
a somewhat decent

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
you know,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
somewhat decent

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I guess bandwidth or whatever. That's gonna

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
take at least an hour

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
to download. Are you gonna really wanna have

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
to deal with that bullshit?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
You know, that you have to download a big portion

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
of the game in the first place to

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
be able to even play the single player campaign?

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I think that's just kind of ridiculous.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
What if we even would do that?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I don't know.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
And is this something that says,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
okay, yeah, we're gonna have

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
you know, this extra

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
content that we're building up to launch.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Does that mean that later on, after it

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
launches, that they're gonna put all that content

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
onto the disc later on?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Are they gonna do that, or are they just gonna

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
say, eh, fuck it, or whatever?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I think this is

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
too much of the letting the

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
day one patch fix your problems.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Dude, if this game isn't ready at launch,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
then don't launch it with it.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Launch it a couple weeks later. It's fine.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Because you're already gonna have games coming out,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
so what if it doesn't come out day one?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
That's okay. It's sometimes good to have things

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
a little later, too. I mean, like, you know, Infamous

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
is- The Wii U could've used that.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Yeah, Infamous isn't coming out day one and stuff,

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
and I just don't understand

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
why they wouldn't push it.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I wanna say that a lot

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
of release dates for games

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
have to do with money and advertising.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
With advertising,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
with deals

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
with distributors. I really

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
think that that's where a lot of it comes into. So they set

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
this date that may or may

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
not be realistic,

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
and don't want to violate that date,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
so they go ahead and ship and keep

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
working on it so that they have the patches ready.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
That's my thought on why they do that, but

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I still- I would personally prefer

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
them to wait. They can ship the data,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
but I understand, yeah, that people plan

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
ahead for advertising, but

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
it's- they're planning holiday

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
advertisements and stuff.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
It's a little closer than now.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I mean, now is-

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
you know, that's quite a ways

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
away from launch. You know, whereas

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
holiday advertisements and stuff, they probably want to

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
nail that down maybe by September

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
or something. You know, a couple months out.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I just think that, you know,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
it's not gonna be ready, and they know it

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
now. They know right now their plan

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
is not gonna ship the game complete.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
That's a big problem

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
if you know that you're not gonna hit your launch

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
and you're already, you know, how many months out?

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Just push it. Just push the game

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
if it's not gonna be ready. Now, the question is

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
are other games gonna be like this?

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Are we gonna see the same thing with Rise

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
because they've rushed the launch

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
for this system.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Has Rise been worked on for quite some time now?

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
It doesn't matter. I don't care. I mean,

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
there's been games that have shipped

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
incomplete, you know, before,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
so I'm just not-

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I don't know. It's

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
disheartening, I guess.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But, you know, whatever, they're not gonna tell anybody

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
about it, so. Well,

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I guess they did. That's kind of weird. They probably

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
won't tell the general public about it.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
It won't be on the, you know, box saying

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
hey, you need to connect to the internet to play this.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
It's all incentives. Alright. Well, here's

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
a game I'm sure they will have no problem delaying

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
until it's damn near perfect, although

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I mean, sometimes this game gets bugs too.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
There was a pretty infamous one

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
on the Wii release of Zelda.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And, come on, we all

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
know that there's gonna be a Wii U game

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
or a Zelda game on the Wii U.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
We all know that's something that's gotta happen.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Maybe something revealed next year. Who knows.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
And, Satoru Iwata

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
has come out saying, you know, we hope to reveal

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
this game in the not-too-distant

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
future. Quote,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It is true that Mr. Anuma's

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
see, I can never say this guy's name. Sorry.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Anuma's team has been working on a new

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Zelda title for Wii U, but the only

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
announcement we have at the time of software that will

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
soon become available is Wind Waker HD.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
But, they are actually working on an

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
exclusive new Wii U title in the Zelda franchise

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
and I hope in the not-too-distant future

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
we will be able to make the relevant announcement.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
So, it's like, yes,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
it's coming, but,

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
no. Yes, it's coming.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And, the demo is on the Wind Waker

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
HD disc. That would be

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
awesome, but, probably not happening.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
But, anyway, what I really wanted to talk

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
about was an interview with

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Anuma

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
who was talking about

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
the tired formula

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
of traditional Zelda games.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I might be kind of

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
embellishing that a little bit, but

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
here it is. Here's the quote in what he said

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
in an interview with LA Times. Quote,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
It's not that anyone is telling me we have to

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
change the formula. I want to change it.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I'm kind of getting tired of it.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
If I'm getting tired of it, then I'm sure other people are

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
getting tired of it. There's an essential Zelda

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I feel we need to stay true to. We are

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
still testing things, exploring our options.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
We haven't landed anywhere at this point. We're still

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
seeing what we can do. What I want to do, not

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
specifically with Link, but with the Zelda franchise,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
I'm always striving to make something no

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
one else can. Something that is so

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
distinctly Zelda that it can only be done

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
in a Zelda game. There are times when I

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
hit walls and I can't come up with new ideas and I

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
think, maybe I should just give up and quit. But,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
eventually, a new idea comes along and I'm proud of myself.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
It breathes new life into the creative

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
process. I go through these phases

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
over and over again. I hope those high points keep

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
on coming. Alright, despite the whole

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
fact that he says he's getting tired of it, I

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
wouldn't read too much into that. I just would think

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
that the next game is going to

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
probably not necessarily

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
be quite like

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Skyward Sword and Twilight

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Princess and all that. It might have some

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
differences. But, we've already heard about that.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I remember a story about three, four months ago

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
that Skyrim was influencing

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Zelda as well, a little bit.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Maybe something more open world?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I would, well, I mean,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Zelda kind of already is

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
pretty open world, the more recent ones.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
But, I mean, maybe a little less,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I mean, the dungeons

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
could be fluid, but it isn't even like that

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
in Skyrim. I mean, you go through a

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
transition from open world to...

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I used to be an adventurer, but I took a hookshot

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
to the knee.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Shut up.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I think what's going to be neat

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
is that, you know, Nintendo

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
is very passionate about the whole two

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
screen thing. And I'm sure they're

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
going to think of a way to really incorporate

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
the two screen thing into

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Zelda and do it well. And if I knew

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
what that was, then I

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
would be making the new Zelda game. But

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I'm pretty sure when we see it, we're going to be like

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
that's pretty awesome. And, you know,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
how did Zelda work without this before? I think

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
they'll be able to do something with this.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Slidekick

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
is in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
and says, that's great news. I love

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Zelda, but Skyward Sword was a step forward

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
in the right direction and they need to continue to

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
experiment with it. So,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
there you go.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Hopefully we'll get more info on this soon.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
But in the meantime,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
let's go back to a more classic

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
era of video games.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I was really short. Let's go

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
to when Zelda 2 was

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
completely breaking the formula and some

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
people hated it for that. No, no, no. Let's go

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
earlier than that. Let's go even earlier

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
than that. Let's go to me being

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
six years old. Oh my God.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Is this a game

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
that was long like...

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I had to stand on a step stool

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
to play it. Was it

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Pong? No. Not that

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
old. Was it Space War? No.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Girl, please. Alright.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
It's the classic game of the week. Dark Soccer's gonna

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
jump into her gaming vault and pull a game

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
out of her butt that she

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
framed. Ah! No.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
It's Kangaroo.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I'm gonna jump right into it.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
It was done by Sun Electronics

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
distributed

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
by Atari.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
It's sort of

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
like a cross between Donkey Kong and Popeye.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
You basically play a mother

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
kangaroo who has to rescue her baby,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
her little joey. You go through the

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
tree tops and

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
beat up monkeys. I was not aware

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
that there were monkeys in Australia. Are there monkeys

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
in Australia? There's kangaroos in Australia.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
But why are there monkeys?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
They just run

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
the other direction. Okay.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
My thought is that

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
they're really criminals because you know

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
that's how Australia was started. Yes.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I know the Australians love it when you point that out.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I think that

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
they're pink criminals.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So I'm gonna go with that. That's my head cannon.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
You cannot convince me otherwise.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
So you can punch apples and

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
throw them at

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
they

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
throw apples at you and you can punch them and

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
you

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
can knock down the monkeys with it. So

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
basically you go up ladders

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
through trees to rescue your baby kangaroo.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
There are four different

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
levels and basically like I said

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
you rescue the joey

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and you get apples thrown at you

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and you get to beat up the mean monkeys.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
You can punch them with your boxing gloves

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
and you can punch the apples

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and you can punch other fruit. You just go around

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
punching shit. And then

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
you have to watch out for the big

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
ape who tries to take your gloves

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
away. You can't punch him if you don't have boxing

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
gloves. But I would just think

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
that a kangaroo could kick him in the face.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Cause I imagine that being kicked by a kangaroo

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
would really freaking hurt.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
So

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
it's uh, the third level

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
is the different one cause the baby kangaroo

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
is um

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
actually being held up by monkeys

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
and you get apples

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
that uh

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
basically uh get sent up on

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
you for when you climb up there so you have to punch

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
the monkeys several times until the cage

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
is open. Punch the monkey.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
At least I didn't say punch the monkey.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Never mind, that's rude.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
So the music

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
in the background is uh like

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
old classical folk tunes. You have

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
the American Patrol

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
by F.W. Meachum

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
and Oh Susanna

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
and you have

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Westminster Quarters where the bell

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
plays to and

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Marcia Alla Turca which was

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
well

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
music inspired by that

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
by Beethoven so

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
anyway it came out on the

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Atari 2600 and the 5200

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
which I have both copies of. The 5200

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
version is super good.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Never play it with a trackball by the way

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
because you will want to shoot yourself in the face.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Now

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
kangaroo

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
was actually involved

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
with the Saturday Supercade. You remember that Rob?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I actually do. 1984.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Kangaroo and Space Ace

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
replaced Pitfall Harry, Frogger and Donkey Kong

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Jr. for segments on that show.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
And so basically the kangaroos

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
were Katie and Joey

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and they lived in a

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
zoo run by Mr. Friendly

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
and they were friends

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
with Sid the Squirrel

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
and they had to fight the

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Monkey Biz Gang.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Which you know who won? Oh that's actually cool.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I didn't know that. One of the voices for one of the monkeys

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
was Frank Welker. They were Bingo

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Bango Bongo and Fred.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
You can actually get those on DVD.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
That's kind of cool. I need to go get those on DVD.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So yeah. Kangaroo.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Fun game.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Now here's my

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
background story on this one.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Imagine 1982.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Six years old.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I'm in first grade.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
At Godfather's Pizza.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Kneeling on

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
this weird stool trying

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
to play freaking kangaroo.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
And I kept running

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
back for quarters because I was bound

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
and determined to punch those damn monkeys.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And I punch the monkeys.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Tell us more about how you punch the monkeys.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I punch monkeys all the time.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
That's what they get for

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
throwing poo and yanking it

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
in the zoo. Monkeys are

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
nasty little bastards.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
I love

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
monkeys. I love lemurs.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
If someone

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
said, do you want a monkey or a lemur?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I pick a lemur every time.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Or a kangaroo.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I don't know what the hell that has to do with the game

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
but that's so funny. Monkeys!

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Punching monkeys. There it is.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
The Punching Monkey classic.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Kangaroo.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Available in arcades everywhere.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Punching monkeys.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Look for it where you can punch your favorite monkeys. Tigerclaw posted

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
up the intro to the kangaroo cartoon.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
There you go.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
But you know what? Nothing is as awesome as punching a monkey.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I stand by

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
my monkey punching. There's your classic

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
game of the week. At least I didn't say

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
donkey. I was waiting the whole

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
time for you to make a donkey punch punch.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Anyhow. I wasn't going to say it

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
but I did anyway. Let's take a break

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
and Dark Soccer

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
has got to go punch a monkey or two. When we come back

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
with more of Orange Lawn's radio. Do you have

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
monkeys? Lots of responses to the

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
question of the week. No, just a cat and you can't

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
punch her. She doesn't like that. I will punch

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
her by petting her. And

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
the mail bag, maybe. I don't know. There were no

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
emails in there this morning when I looked.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And your phone calls

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
when we come back with more of Orange Lawn's

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
radio right after this break.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Stay tuned.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Congratulations.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Congratulations.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Is my mic off? Hi.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Thanks to our

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
friends at gamefood.org for that

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
bumper. Appreciate it.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Sometimes I wish we

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
did a tape show like they did so that way

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I could cover up all those screw ups when they

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
happen like I don't have my mic on.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
That's the second

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
time you've heard that bumper. That's because

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
we're not getting

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
any more bumpers from our listeners.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Shame on all of you. So you should

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
definitely send us some. Check the

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
forums over at vognetwork.com

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
and you can send us a bumper. And

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
you can tell us whatever you want. Use your voice

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
here on the program to tell

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
us whatever. We have a lot of people

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
giving their voices to the FUGL

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
question of the week here in a little bit. But we'll

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
play that. We'll get to that in a

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
little bit here. But first we have some

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
rapid fire news we've got to go over.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Loki.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Alright. Let's talk

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
a little bit about

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
the awesome game that is Saints

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Row 4.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And there was some wonderful

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
news that came out from a panel at

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Comic-Con

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
actually. And they were talking a little bit

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
about some of the scrapped ideas that they had.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Originally the end of the game was

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
going to have a Bollywood dance number.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Which...

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
that's awesome. Outstanding. Outstanding.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
The only problem was

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
it wasn't possible for them to

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
do that because of the cost.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
By the time they figured out which

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Bollywood

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
song to license

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
and also

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
doing all the choreography and stuff like that

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
and the motion capture. It was just going to be too

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
much. So they just couldn't

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
end up doing that.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Although I'm sure the ending

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
of the game is going to be awesome.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Apparently though they said that there's some really interesting

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
details in the game. They're kind of calling it

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
they're joking that

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Saints Row is about the arts.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
And I guess they have one of the in-game

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
radio stations where the

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
evil alien guy

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Zinyak. He's

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
actually reading a bunch of different classical

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
literature including

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
monologues from Shakespeare and

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
even the entire first chapter of Jane

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Austin's Pride and Prejudice.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Spoiler alert!

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I will not be listening to that station.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I've been listening to the dubstep dance

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
as I

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
always do.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And probably flipping

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
between that and the 80's station because I hear the 80's

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
station is pretty awesome. Will you listen to your dubstep

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
while you use your dubstep gun?

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
No!

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Assuming that I can fire

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
that out the window, yes.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Most likely, no.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I can't leave this.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
I can't wait.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
It's not much longer now, right?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
We're getting to that point of the year. It's getting closer.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
What is today?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
July 21st.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
We're like five weeks away

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
from Final Fantasy 14

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Realm Reborn.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
That's going to be a tight schedule.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Alright.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
So I guess here's a positive.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Xbox One is also going to support partial

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
download support.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Or I should say partial download play.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Meaning that while a game is being downloaded

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
you will be able to play

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
the game thanks to the cloud.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Cool. When the cloud works.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
When the cloud works.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Final Fantasy 7 is an indication, though granted

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
the servers are not even

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
run by the same company.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Perhaps you have to level up

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
cloud so that he has his limit break.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Limit break is cloud saving.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
No, you get the limit break at level one.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
You get to use limit breaks in the beginning of the game.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Where have you been?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Alright.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Uh oh. Troll comment in our chat room.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Not really, but live.vognetwork.com

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
I'm going to read it anyway.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
MaskedBishop in our chat room says

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I'm still trying to figure out the selling point

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
of the Saints Row series. Loki?

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
It depends which one you're talking about.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
The original Saints Row games were kind of like a

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Grand Theft Auto. In fact

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Saints Row 1 for me was

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Hey, Grand Theft Auto is on the Xbox 360

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I'm going to play this game. And it was fun.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I think kind of the last few

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
games it's just been so over the top

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
and ridiculous that it's entertaining.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And Bobby is informing me yes

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You can listen to the radio anytime because it's cyberspace

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
and the radio stations are injected directly into your brain.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Awesome. So yes, you can listen to the dubstep

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
while firing the dubstep gun.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Hooray.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Well let me say this. In my experience

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
with at least Saints Row 3

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Saints Row is good

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
for the same reason that This is the End

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
was good. It's fucking ridiculous

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
and dumb as hell, but you can't help

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
but laugh. Like it's just over the top

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
stupid. It's beyond over the top.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Yeah. And some of the things in that movie

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
were just ridiculous

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
but I laughed. Like it was so funny.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
It's not. See Grand Theft Auto

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
is trying to take itself like kind of

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
like an Oscar movie I guess where it's

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
very well done. Grand Theft Auto is a little

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
ridiculous in itself. It is a little ridiculous.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Some of the things you can do. But they're definitely going

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
along the lines of realism. Like the amount of

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
detail that they have in the game with the whole

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
like stock markets and

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
you know just all the stuff you can do in the game

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
it's you know they're going

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
one way with Grand Theft Auto. Whereas Saints

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Row is like kind of going the completely opposite

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
direction. They're just like hey you know

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
be fun as if we have super powers. Are we going to explain

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
it. Whatever. He's in the matrix now

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
OK. They're done. OK. Sweet

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
You know hey we're going to have a gun that fires

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
dubstep.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Whatever. It's just ridiculous. It's supposed to be

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
ridiculous.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
And that's the whole point. I mean if that's the type

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
of game you want to play then play Saints Row.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I honestly think it should play both because

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
they're both awesome. I will be playing

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
both. A lot.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
So much so that I'm probably not going to get

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
PlayStation 4 now. Maybe.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
BlackWolf and TimTrip

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
are having a conversation in our chat room about it

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
and BlackWolf says Tim

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Saints Row 4 is basically Grand Theft Auto meets

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Crackdown meets Over the Top Humor especially

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
with their version of the Crackdown orbs.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Oh. Alan's here to give

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
comment. Hi Alan. Hello.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Just want to say because I beat

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Grand Theft Auto 4 all the way through just a couple weeks

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
ago after the insanity of GTA

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
3 San Andreas which there was a lot

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
of crazy stuff in that. A lot of people thought

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
that 4 proper with

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Niko Bellic was too dry. Oh yeah. It's very

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
bleak and just super serious. Well did you

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
get to, did you play through the Valet of

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Gay Tony? No. I'm only like an hour into

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Lost and Damned.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Ok. When you get to Valet of Gay Tony it's kind of like they're trying

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
to bring it back towards San Andreas.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And I think honestly that was

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
like the best as far as like playing with the weapon

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
set and stuff like that. It was the best. And then

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I guess you can tell already from the gameplay trailer

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
for 5 that they realized that they

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
don't want to turn the dial up to Saints

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Row crazy but they need to have

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
more over the top

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
stuff in it I think.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
They're just giving you more freedom without

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
going crazy with the stuff that's in there.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
In San Andreas wasn't there like a big wheel? Like it

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
wasn't mod you could just drive a big wheel around?

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I don't

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
remember. It's been a while. You could like parachute

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
off buildings. A lot of crazy stuff and then 4

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
was very

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
very bleak.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Captain Spike in our

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I want games to be fun. Games and

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
all. Not really here for Grand Theft Auto's 4

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
story wants to be an Oscar winning movie

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
bullshit or whatever. It was fun. You just don't

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
play the main storyline. Who cares?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Once in a while I'm ok

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
with Oscar worthy video games

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
though. Like you know Journey is like a Night of the Met.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Seriously Saints Row the 3rd is fun. It's pretty

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
fun. There's a little bit

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
of repetition when it comes to some of the activities

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
and stuff but I think Saints Row

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
the 3rd was fun and Saints Row 2 was actually

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
pretty fun so Saints Row 4 sounds like

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
it's going to be a lot of fun too. Alright let's move on.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
We got to rail a little bit. Did you just say your thing?

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
No no I haven't done that yet. Last

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
but not least they're trying

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
to bring back

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
sort of a spiritual successor

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
to Police Quest.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
It's actually being done by the same creator

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Robert

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Lindsley

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I guess and he

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
is trying to kick start a game called

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Precinct and right now their funding

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
goal is half a million dollars

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
and

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
so yeah

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
apparently I mean the game is going to be very similar

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
to I guess

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
the Police Quest series and

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
if you're looking to get a game similar

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
to that then maybe you should try

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
backing this. Right now as of recording

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
they are up to $50,000

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
actually close to $51,000

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
still a ways away from their goal but they have 25

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
days left so there is a

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
chance and some of the concept

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
art looks actually pretty sweet. It's all

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
like first person you have like the patrol view

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
and stuff like that so

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
looks like it could be pretty cool.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Okay.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And I like their precinct funding

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
chart here. They said our campaign

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
they're you know $500,000

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
awesome $600,000

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
awesomer $700,000

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
mega awesome

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
$800,000 plus badonk.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Alright

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
well hopefully this movie will be pretty

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
badonk but the first signs of

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
the World of Warcraft movie

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
was shown at Comic Con. The teaser

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
trailer unveiled at Comic Con

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
but here's the thing the movie doesn't have any

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
stars attached yet so there wasn't really a

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
lot to show but the teaser did

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
have a mix of live action and computer

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
generated effects.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
It was out in a desert field and had an armored

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
human warrior that drank a potion and

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
drew a sword just before battling

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
a hammer wielding orc.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Of course as we all know Duncan Jones

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
who did Source Code and Moon and

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
also importantly as David Bowie's son

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
is helming the Warcraft

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
film. It's supposed to begin

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
shooting in early 2014. I'm assuming

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
that means released in probably

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
2015. Can Bowie

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
get like a monarch

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
you know position in the movie? I would love

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
that. I would love that. Perhaps the

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
king of the goblins? I think

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I think the reason why he

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
goes by the name Duncan Jones is he doesn't

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
want to be in the shadow of his dad though so

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I would I would really really

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
be surprised if David Bowie turns up in this

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
at all. And maybe he can

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
you know do a little dance magic

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
dance. Now by the

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
way this clip is not on the internet

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
for us to see. I don't know if it leaked

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
out to YouTube. I'm sure it's out there somewhere

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
but Blizzard has said there is no plans

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
to release the mood piece that

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
was shown at Comic Con. That was only for

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Comic Con and not for public

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
consumption which I'm actually okay with

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
because again it's not

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
real footage from the movie so to speak

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
because there's no stars attached yet or anything

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
so interesting though that it's a human

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
versus an orc

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
the movie is also just called Warcraft

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
it's not called World of Warcraft

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
so I'm wondering if they're taking it way back

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
like they might be taking the story way back

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
to like the original humans versus orc story which

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
is alright. As it should be.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Yeah I think I think fans would be

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
forgiving if that's where they want to go with it

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
so. It used to all be about Sylvanas

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
and all that.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Moving on to some other quick news

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
here.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Oh yes some voices

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
being crowd sourced here

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
for Oddworld

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
If you would like

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
to have your voice featured in the game

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
as a Madonkin

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
you can be in the remake

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
there. You just have to record in a

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
microphone there a few phrases

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
and you make a Soundcloud account. Make sure things

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
sound fine. Don't have a lot of feedback

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
in the background or whatever. It's over on

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
the official blog Oddworld.com

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
and you have to get those in by

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Friday July 26th.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
But you could have your voice featured in the game. I wonder if I should

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
send something in. I think that might be fun.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I could use the recording equipment here.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
You have to say such things as

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I'm pulling up the blog here. Some of the

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
like

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
it was very simple stuff. Some of it was like

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
ow. Ogg.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
You know things like that.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Yeah. Which of course now it's not coming up

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
but anyhow.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Let me try one more time.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
This link here might show it.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Live radio

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
of course. There we go.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
The words to say are

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
hello, okay, laughing

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
giggling, angry hissing,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
pain grunts, death screams

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
and bonus points for providing some sound

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
effects for the wildlife of Mudos.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Birds, scarabs, elumes, etc.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Just

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
get on the microphone. I'm a bird.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Make strange noises

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
because somebody is going to have to listen to it.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Is your mic not on Dark Sakura?

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
The chat room is bitching.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Oh you were muted.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Damn it Rob!

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
That's awesome.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
That was totally my bad. Sorry Dark Sakura.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
That was not awesome. That was lame.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Boy we're all sorts of broken here at OLR tonight.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Sorry about that.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Anyhow, Dark Sakura

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I have a new story to make it all better.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Alright, so here's the deal.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Capcom working on what

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
they're calling a major IP for the Nintendo 3DS

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
it's called Geist Crusher.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
It's a multiplayer game where you're going to

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
fight monsters known as Geists

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
or G-A-I-S-T-S. Geists.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Here's the thing though, Geist Crusher

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
co-developed by Treasure.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
So there you go. The announcement's

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
on Treasure's website, treasure-inc.co.jp

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
so

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Capcom and Treasure are coming

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
together for this.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
So did that make it a little better?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I might be a little tingly.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Alright, then why don't you do some news

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
with your now newly on mic.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Yeah.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Thanks Rob.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Well in other news

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
it's actually not pulling up.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Great. Oh yeah, Valve

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
while they will not give us

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
a Half-Life 3 yet

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
they are

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Because they don't love you.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Oh, they don't love somebody.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
So

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
they are actually

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
working with

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
the

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
modding community.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
So they're

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
basically

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Come on thing. I'm sorry

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
it's my iPad being stupid.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
So basically

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
they are doing the Half-Life

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
campaign as a co-op

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
and it's going to be put on

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
for free and it's going to be

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
available through Steam.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
So that is at least

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
something new, right?

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
And it's the Sven co-op

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
as a standalone game.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
In other news

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
this makes me super happy

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
there's an Adventure Time game

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
It's actually

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
going to be out

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
in the fall

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and 3DS

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
and it's called Adventure Time

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Explore the dungeon because I don't know.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
So

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I'm super, super, super

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
excited. I like Adventure Time.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
And last

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
but not least

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
this actually makes me super happy

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
has new characters to add to it

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
including

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Stan Lee

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Howard the Duck

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
and Squirrel Girl. I love Squirrel Girl

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
because she kicked the crap out of Thanos

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
and Doctor Doom and did it legit

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
through the power of squirrels.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
So yeah, also included

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
there's Doctor Doom, Jean Grey

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
What exactly is the power of squirrels?

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
She talks to squirrels. Her power is control of squirrels.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And she can speak squirrel language

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
and she also has sharp teeth and little claws

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
and a big bushy tail and she can climb

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
up trees.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
She also can kick anybody's ass.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Apparently Squirrel Girl cannot be defeated by anybody.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
And she's also Jessica Jones' nanny.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
So that makes her super cool.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
But yeah, also

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
confirmed is Doctor Doom,

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Jean Grey, Elektra, Magneto,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Silver Samurai, The Punisher, Beast,

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Gambit Storm, Green Goblin,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Juggernaut, Rhino, The Thing, Vulture,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Sabretooth, and Invisible Woman.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So we also

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
will have

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Coulson in the game.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
And you have a pre-order exclusive

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
The Iron Patriot and Deadpool.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
So there you go.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
There you go.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Alright, let's go to the foogle question

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
of the week. Which, oh my gosh,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
this is one of the most popular ones we've ever asked.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
There's so many answers this week. I don't know what to do.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Alright, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
You take Facebook

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
and Google, you slam them together, you get

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
foogle. And we ask a question of our

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Facebook and Google Plus communities

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
every week here on the show. And it's

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
foogle. And I

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
knew the news about

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Strider was going to make Dark

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Sakura very happy. And Dan, we talked

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
about that in part A. I feel all squishy now.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
So I wanted to ask a similar question of the

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
listeners tonight with the foogle question of the week. And that is

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
what long dormant series would you

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
like to see make a comeback? And I said

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
listeners, you only get to pick one to try and

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
keep the answers a little bit short tonight.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
There are alone

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
like 23 answers on Facebook.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Should I read them all? That's a lot. Do eat.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
I'm going to read them all quickly.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I'm only going to read

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
like little bits and pieces. If I don't read the entire

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
answer, I'm sorry. You'll just have to go

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
read them for yourself. Facebook.com

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
or Google Plus community.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Guess what? What? You're not really sorry.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Alright. VX JasonXV says

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
bust a groove. But

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
this also means it will probably end up a

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
connect, move, or wiimote dancing game.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Bust a move. Move.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Well, it depends what country.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Unfolded Raptor says

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
new Gex game. Even if it's not

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Gex 4, just a really nice reboot.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Rob

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
himself says a remake of California

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
games because he played that to death

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
on the Sega Master System along with Strider.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
James

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
S says I want a new entry to the Soul

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Blazer saga, but I'd settle for a remastered

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Terra Enigma trilogy for my 3DS.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
That is a fucking great answer.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I'll have you know. I would love

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
that too. Jeremy J,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
our buddy from Koopa Club says Mega Man.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
See, here's the thing with

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Mega Man though is that although Capcom

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
has been really, they've just

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
been dicks about it to an extent.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Like, at least

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
there was Mega Man 9 and 10

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
and those weren't that long

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
ago all things considered. And

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
the Mega Man and Smash Brothers thing, now

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I admit, I as much as the next person would

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
like to see a new 3D Mega Man Legends

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
or just like in a Mega Man 11

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
in the 2-bit style or you know

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
kind of like a 2.5D kind of

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Mega Man game I think would be awesome, especially maybe

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
on like the Wii U or something, but

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I don't know. Mega Man's not

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
as

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
it hasn't been as horribly long

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
for Mega Man yet as some other games

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I can think of like on the Nintendo and so forth

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
but. Like I don't know

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
the Guardian Legend. Yeah

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
right. Seriously? I don't think anybody

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
answered Guardian Legend to which I

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
say all fail. All these people are wrong. Yeah

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
so it's unfortunate that all of our listeners had to be wrong

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
tonight. Alright

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Gaming Nerd said a new

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Alex Kidd game. He's been featured

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
in Sega collections but never a new game

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
or a remake of his own. It would be nice to

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
see Alex Kidd come back wouldn't it?

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
DJ Rama S says

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
one of the most underrated and underappreciated fighting

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
games, Rival Schools.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Yeah I love Rival Schools. Zether

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
says Gradius. Konami's kept it locked

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
up for far too long. But didn't we

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
have Gradius 5 just a few years ago?

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Was it really that, not that long ago?

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
I don't think it was that long ago.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
William Murderface says

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
a sequel to Darkwatch. It would be

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Halo but with vampire cowboys.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
That'd be cool.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Fifth Dream says I was talking about Section Z

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
and would love to see it make a comeback.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Kareem J says

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Streets of Rage 4. Thanks.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Loco Poco

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
says I'd love to see an Ill Bleed

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
sequel. It was a great mixture of horror and

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
camp.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Nikki E says Streets of Rage.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I still keep coming back to that game series.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Code Man says Mega Man Legends.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Rich B says

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
not really a series but I've always wanted to see

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
a follow up to Midnight Resistance on the

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Sega Genesis. Midnight Resistance is a good game.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Yeah, I'll be. Especially

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
something kind of like really off the radar

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
like that. I think I've done it for Classic.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
You probably have at some point.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
But still I mean

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
like he said in the answer

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
there was never a series there, just one

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
really good game that we want to see something

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
else with.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Raginator says Samurai Showdown series

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
provided that an update stays true to the

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
original five games, 2D and Pixels.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
They actually said that they were completely

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
closing the series off after five so I don't think that's happening.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Bastards. We'll open it back

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
up.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Let's see. Edgar R says

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
a new duck hunt.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
This time the dog dies.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Gamer Girl says

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
even though this isn't a series I'd love to see Kid Chameleon.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
I love that game. It's a good pick.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Chiggers says Altered Beast.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Yeah, make it

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
better this time too.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
KNIM says Secret of Evermore.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I'd be happy if they released it again on anything

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
but Square doesn't want my money evidently.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Yeah, Secret of Evermore kind of gets

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
crapped on because it was the Square

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
USA title and it wasn't really part of the

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
second Detsetsu series. It was like a spinoff but

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Secret of Evermore had some neat stuff about it.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Did you know that that was one of the first soundtracks

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
that, what's his name, Jeremy Sulay

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
that guy that does the soundtracks for Elder Scrolls

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
and stuff? He did the soundtrack for Secret of Evermore.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
It was one of his first games ever. He was probably like 19

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
when he did it. How's that game?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I think Secret of Evermore

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
was really shit on when it first came

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
out but like I think Time

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
has treated it well and the whole like

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
you know it wasn't as bad as everybody

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
made it out to be at the time. It just wasn't

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
a second Detsetsu game

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
really even though they kind of tried to make

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
it one.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Pika Uno says it would have to be

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
the platform that got me into gaming in the first place.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Commander Keen would have to

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
be 2D though.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Dark Tetsuya says with the resurrection

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
and Capcom Arcade cabinet, how about

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
a sequel or something to Black Dragon slash Black

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Tiger? I want to say Magic

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Sword was a sequel to it but there hasn't been another one

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
since that. Maybe they could implement Oculus

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Rift support.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Tim Tripp says

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Free Space? I'd just like to see the

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
return of the epic space combat genre.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Anomalous

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Underdog says Vagrant Story.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I even thought of a name for it. Vagrant Army.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
You know we used to call that fragrant story

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
because it stinks.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
No, I know it's not bad but that was the

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
joke at my house. SSG100 Matt

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
says really? No one's going to say Chrono Trigger or

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Chrono Cross? It's long overdue.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Slidekicks says with the upcoming

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
release of DuckTales Remastered

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I'd love to see the return of more of

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Capcom's classic Disney platformers.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Like a modern tale on the adventures

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
in the Magic Kingdom. It's a fun blend

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
of different games with a flawless Disney theme

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
and I think a new version would even be more

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
immersive. As long as it was more like

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Nintendo Land and not so much like Connect Disneyland

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Adventures which was sadly a big flop.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
But here's the thing though, is that Connect Disneyland

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Adventures kind of was Adventures in the

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Magic Kingdom. I mean, they

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
really were the same type

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
of thing. It's just that Magic Kingdom

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
was out when you were a kid.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
So it was like, you know, it held up

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
a little better than Connect Disneyland Adventures

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
did I think.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And lastly on Facebook, Shane says

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Rising Xan. It will

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
leave you with a theme, and I'll leave you with a

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
theme song because that should be enough

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
to spike some second hand sales of the game.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
How can anyone not love this? It's a Ninja

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Cowboy.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Rising Xan was a fun

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
game.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I'm gonna skip ahead a bit.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I'm gonna skip ahead a bit.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I like the idea of a Ninja Cowboy.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
But not as cool as the Ninja Pirate.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Uh, let's see. Anyhow,

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
going to Google Plus,

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
of which there's only four answers, but

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Retertainment says Skate or Die.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
That was a fun one.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Biz says Pokemon Snap.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Travis H says Shining

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Force. Ooh, this is a good

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
answer. Act Def says Uniracers.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
That game was awesome.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
What?

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Get out.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
You know what was kind of a sequel

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
to Uniracers was Excite Truck

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
in a way. Like, the same type of thing with the stunts

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
and everything, mid-air and all that. A little bit.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
A little bit. Alright.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Lots of great answers you guys,

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
except you all failed for

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
not mentioning the Guardian legend. Get out.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Honestly though, the Uniracer

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
or Unicycle should come back

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
as a Smash Brothers fighting

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
character. Yes.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
It'd be pretty sweet. It'd be awesome.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Well I suppose if Sega can have Daytona

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
cars fighting, then we can have a fighting Unicycle.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
That's right. Or at least as like

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
a power-up or something. Like Princess Peach can ride

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
the Unicycle around and do tricks or something.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
I don't know. Alright, let's get back

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
to some more news. Loki.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Alright.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
So they're doing this really

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
interesting promotion

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I guess. It's Ouya's $1,000,000

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Free the Games Fund.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
They're boosting Kickstarter games.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Or Kickstarted

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
games I guess. So what's

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
going to happen is I guess between August

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
9th and August 10th

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
next year

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
any

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
or I guess a game will

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
qualify as long as it's achieved its

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
minimum goal of $50,000.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
And Ouya

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
will match the total raised up to

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
$250,000.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
So I'm guessing this is going to be

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
quite limited if you're

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
going to only have a million

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
dollars to shuffle around

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
and

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
you're going to pledge with

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
$250,000.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Also I guess the

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
game will receive an additional

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
$100,000

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
if I guess it's

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
one of the most

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
successful Kickstarter projects

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
to take part in the Free the Games program.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I believe

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
that the trick

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
with that, there is a big

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
but, you

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
need to have your game

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
exclusive for the Ouya for six months.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
So

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
that's the only

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
drawback I guess.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
That's cheating.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
But hey, free money.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Money's good.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
I don't know.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Money is always good, of course.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
But don't they have to fix some of these other

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
problems, like their customer service and so forth first?

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
God, that's what I suggested. I'm like, hey, you know

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
the problem is

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
that you don't have enough games on the system.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Although more would be good.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
More would be good, but I don't

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
think you're going to get, I mean look at this.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I understand that games

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
have budgets and stuff like that and

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
they can be quite expensive, especially if you have a team of people.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
But

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I don't know, for like an indie game, I would think

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
like $100,000 is

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
quite a bit. I mean

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
especially if you're talking like a small team of people.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
And that's a

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
lot of money.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I think, I don't know. But even like

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
let's say if we're going to take the high

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
end here and you have $250,000

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
so a total of half a million dollars

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
for

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
a game, I mean that's quite a bit.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I mean it'd better be one hell of a good

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
game. I mean there's some pretty decent

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
games on there right now, but

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
I don't think any of them cost half a million dollars

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
or even $100,000

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
to make.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Alright well moving on

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
to a little

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
quote about a spinoff for

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
a very well received game from this year.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
It has to do with the Tomb Raider series.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
And Gail Simone,

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
who is a comic book veteran.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
She is awesome.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
What kind of other stuff is she doing? I don't follow comics.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
She's the only, one of the only reasons I ever

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
read anything DC on purpose.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
She did

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
what did she do?

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Birds of Prey.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Even I know what that is because that was a CW show.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
But

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
she is probably one of the

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
best female comic book writers

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
out there. Awesome. Well she's teaming up

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
with publisher Dark Horse

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
to work on a Tomb Raider comic.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
But what caught people's attention was this quote.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
She said quote,

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
In continuity it will be a Tomb Raider canon

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
and lead directly into the sequel.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
This is what got me excited.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
We get to be part of Lara Croft

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
history. Well they haven't

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
announced a sequel to Tomb Raider.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
So this quote kind of

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
grabbed people's attention. Although

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I mean let's be real. It would make

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
a lot of sense. Like you didn't

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
expect a sequel. Exactly right. Like the game

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
was well received. It did perform under.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Well but we all kind of

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
looked at that quote in the beginning and kind of went

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
really? Really with that

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
quote? Are people just pulling this way out of context?

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
A? Why not

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
A plus?

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
That's right. Well

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
plus I would think that if they're

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
going to make a sequel it's going to

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
likely use a lot of the same components

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
that were in the original. So like I'm saying

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
they don't have to necessarily reinvent the wheel

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
with a sequel. They can carry over

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
a lot of stuff that they did with the first game.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I mean granted they'd want to do bigger

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
better and all that other stuff but. How more

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
can we kill her more?

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Right. But I would

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
think that you wouldn't necessarily maybe have to

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
put the same financial

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
investment into it

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
necessarily. So maybe you could

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
still get bang for the buck.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
And maybe make up for this

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
perceived lack. Although

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I don't know. Again

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I still think it seems like the game's

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
done well. And I'm sure it sold a ton of extra copies.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
What was it? Eight bucks on the steam

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
sale this week. And I'm sure there were a lot of people

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
that snapped it up for that. So.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I've had a lot of fun playing it

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Some other comments from

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Gail Simone. The storytelling in the game

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
hooked me instantly. The biggest difference

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
is the game told a claustrophobic

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
story in an isolated setting. We are

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
going globe trotting.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
So maybe if there is a

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
sequel. If this ties into it.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
It'll be more Laura exploring

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
rather than the whole you know escape from

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
you know Death Sentence Island.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
She'll be seeking the legendary

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
elusive art thief

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Carmen Sandiego.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Alright.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
So. Anyhow.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Exciting that. I mean.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Although I think a sequel to

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Good Game is a bit of a duh. It's still

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
exciting to hear that. Speaking of franchise

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
reboot. Carmen Sandiego.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I heard about

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
this. PBS has been teasing this

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
right? No. I was just saying they should do

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
a sequel. No. Like for real. Like PBS

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
on their Tumblr or Twitter

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
these things was posting these things

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
about like. No. No.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Actually no. It wasn't PBS. I think it was the people

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
that owned Carmen Sandiego or like her Twitter.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
But like I think they're doing something where they're gonna

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
play the old game show

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
things again on PBS.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Somebody in chat can help me fill in the gaps. I just remember

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
picking up bits and pieces of this on Twitter.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
But like I think they are setting the stages

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
for a Carmen Sandiego comeback. So it's funny that you

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
bring that up. Cause like. No. Legitimately

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
there's something to that. You know what would be

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
funny? If you

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Where in the world is

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Carmen Sandiego would have worked in the 80's?

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
But imagine like having

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
that now. People be like well just can't we

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
like do GPS and use CCTV

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
and all this.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Yeah we found her in 5 seconds. Oops.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Send a drone.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Or more like

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
What country? Where's that?

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
I've never heard of that country.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
China. What is this? Oh stop.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Alright.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Roo that's made up.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
You're

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
so ignorant. Alright Dark Soccer

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
what do you got? Stuff.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
And it's not Carmen Sandiego.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
It's about Atlas.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Basically Nintendo. Well you know

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Atlas filed for bankruptcy and everyone's

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
worried about a

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
particular series of their Shin Megami Tensei.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Well Nintendo is buying it.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
So we may see a Persona 5 Wii U.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Yeah you made a noise.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
I'm sorry. Sorry no I was laughing at chat.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Sorry. But yeah.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Atlas kind of

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
screwed themselves.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
But Nintendo seems to

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
be grabbing the hot one.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Because you know all the fans that was what they were

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
worried about. What's going to happen with a

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Persona with a Shin Megami Tensei.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
So it looks like Nintendo is saving the series.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I thought this whole

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
bankruptcy thing wasn't supposed to be this big of a deal.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
And now here we're talking Nintendo's

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
snapping up

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
IPs? Yeah.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
How did things go from A to Z

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
like that? Well they've already been working with

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Nintendo in this series because remember the crossover

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
with Fire Emblem?

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
It was like if you have Shin Megami

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Tensei 4

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
there had a

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
crossover promotion with Fire Emblem.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
So if you had both of them you get like

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
$30 eShop credit in North America.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
So

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
that was a big thing. But I think that

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
there's a

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
they're developing Shin Megami

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Tensei cross Fire Emblem

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
for Wii U. So I think

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
it's gonna be

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
I think it's gonna

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
definitely be... I would be something

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
can you imagine if Persona 5 was a

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Wii U exclusive? Now that's

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
that'd be a pretty crazy

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
grab there. Yeah it would be. But it's

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
smart. It's smart move.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Oh yeah.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Just real quick off

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
this is we were talking about Karma San Diego a second ago.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
So I pulled up that article

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
that were on my LinkedIn chat and they were talking about

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
different things. And then at the very bottom of course it said

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
that

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Shirlene Theresa Lynn

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Thigpen the one that was the chief

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
on the show. Oh yeah she passed away. Yeah she passed away

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
in 2003 and stuff. But what I found a little bit

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
disturbing is on

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Wikipedia it actually shows

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
where the resting place is. It tells you

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
which cemetery she is buried in.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
What? There's a lot of Wikis

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
that do that. Wikipedia has that on a lot of

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
articles. That's kind of weird. Yeah no a lot of articles

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
say that. And then there's this whole other site

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
like there's a whole site dedicated... This is where they

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
are buried I think. Yeah there's a whole site dedicated to

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
like celebrity tombstones. I actually

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
I don't know if I should

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
mention this in the show. I have friends

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
that like do that. They go

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
visit them. Like when they go to L.A. they'll go

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
to the famous people. And I had

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
a friend that went to the Pacific Northwest recently

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
and went to some of those tombstones that are out

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
there. And you know I don't like

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
I don't know it's to

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
me I'm like no thank you not my thing

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
but they're not hurting anybody

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
it's all a sign of respect. You know

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
that's why they put tombstones out there so people

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
can go pay their respects and so forth

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
and you know my friends do this all tastefully.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
But yeah there are websites

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
out there that have all the links to this stuff.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
There's also

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
websites that display

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
famous death masks.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Because there's actually still people today who do

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
death masks.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
For anyone who doesn't know what those are basically there's

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
a plaster cast made and then they're cast in

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
bronze or sometimes

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
clay or different things. But

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
the death masks are basically

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
the faces at death once they're

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
you know ready to be buried and saved.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
But there's people who still do death masks to this

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
day and there's websites that have all the modern death masks.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
So I'm going to have one done.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Do Walt Disney have one done?

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
I don't think so. I plan on having

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
one done though. Really? Isn't that expensive?

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
No. I know

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
how much plaster and stuff costs.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Yeah but you can't do it yourself.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
No but I have. Rob how many artists

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
do I know? That's true.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
It costs a lot to join that.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
What did it call the Neptune Society or whatever?

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
The people that'll dump you at sea.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I told

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
my funeral

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
is going to be Jewish

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
and easy. Pine box

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
buried 24 hours later.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
No embalming. I've already

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
mentioned I want to be flung out of a cannon

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
at my work building during the lunch

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
hour. That's all I want. We actually discussed what

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Dan wanted today. What we're doing is we're

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
putting him in his 69 Mustang Coupe

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
loading it with explosives

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
pushing it off a cliff and blowing

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
it up in mid air. Awesome.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
So Genki style

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
and Roger Corman style.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Fancy.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Yes. I am having

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
a Jewish burial and an Irish wake.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Are you calling us unoriginal?

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Yes. Alright moving on

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Loki. So

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Harmonix is due some

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
sweet sweet money.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
And that's because Viacom

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
they lost their appeal.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Which you know there was a whole lawsuit

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I guess that they had owed

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Harmonix some

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
money. And

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
that includes now

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
$299 million dollars with

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
interest.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
So good for Harmonix.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
That should fund some extra

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
tracks in Fantasia.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I guess now

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
it says Harmonix is

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
law firm estimate or estimates

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
including another dispute I guess

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
the company has for a total of

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
$533 million dollars.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
That's a sweet chunk

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
of change.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Maybe that change

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
can go to making 3D versions

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
of all their old games cause that's what some

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
companies do. Although a 3D

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
amplitude would be pretty sweet you gotta admit.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
But Sega is

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
jumping on the 3D bandwagon. We kinda

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
knew this was coming cause there's been hints about

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
the 3D Sonic already. But

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Sega did make the official announcement that Sega

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
classic 3D titles for the 3DS are

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
coming to the west. So this isn't

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
just you know virtual console releases

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
they are redone in the 3D.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I wouldn't expect a whole

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
lot more. I mean that's

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
really it. Like I don't think they're going back and redoing all the graphics

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
or anything like that so don't get your hopes too far up.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
But you will be able to experience

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
3D Altered Beast, 3D

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Echo the Dolphin, 3D Galaxy

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Force 2, 3D Shinobi 3,

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
3D Sonic the Hedgehog, 3D Space Harrier,

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
3D Streets of Rage, and

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
3D Super Hang-On. I think that should look

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
pretty cool considering that you know

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
some of the 3D converts we've seen so far have been

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
NES titles and now these are like 16 bit

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
so. 3D Space Harrier

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
is gonna be sweet. I like

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
3D Kid Icarus was really

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
cool. Like they didn't change a

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
lot but it was just like it was very subtle

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
like they added the backgrounds

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
very subtle updates that

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
made it really cool. Like I like that

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
one a lot. But like some

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
of the 3D remakes were a little silly

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
like 3D Wrecking or no not Wrecking Crew

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
with Urban Champion or whatever that was

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
a little silly. But yeah it'll be

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
cool to check out a couple of these

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
I don't know about 3D Altered Beast like

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I don't... Wise Fumio

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Grave. Like people remember

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
that epicness from the arcade when they were a kid

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
and stuff but like I played through the game recently

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
it's really not that good. It's really

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
not that good. But 3D

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Sonic will be cool even though it'll be like the

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
17th time I've played Sonic.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
But 3D Space Harrier. Yes I'm here for that.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Welcome to the fantasy zone. Get ready.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
I'm getting ready.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
My body is ready.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Are you in the fantasy zone Rob?

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Yes. Alright are you in the mailbag

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
zone? Do we have you? Yes we have two.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
We do have emails tonight. Woohoo!

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Two whole emails. You can email us

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
too. Mailbag at orange

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
lounge radio dot com. Well great I better

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
pay attention cause I have no idea what these are about tonight

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I didn't get to read them in advance. Well this comes from Brad

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
our pod culture Brad. Hi

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
pod culture Brad. At the end of part A

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
you guys said there were not any emails

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
yet so how about a kitty pic instead.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
So they sent us a picture of his kitty

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
pat on the screen. Oh

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
that's adorable. Hi kitty.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Gee cat.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I'm gonna get to meet Brad in

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
five weeks. Kitty unfortunately cannot check in for points

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
for the VOG network cause kitty does not have

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
a cat phone. I am super pissed at my cat.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Why? Because she's trying to chew

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
on my 3DS charge cable.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
And every time I move it out of her way

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
she's like uh uh I'm gonna get it.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Meow.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
You need to buy her a shoestring or something.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
I have toys for her. She plays with all of

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Shermy's toys cause Shermy's too fat and lazy.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
But except I won't give her

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Shermy's mousy. But

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
you know what this house that we're looking at has a

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
cat door in it.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Hee hee. Nice.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Next email. Hey it's

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Ricimo. I haven't called

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I haven't emailed or called in like forever

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
but just a quick thank you for all your hard

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
work and dedication to your craft and to your

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
fans. I've been listening since I first

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
heard about you guys on Joystiq.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
We were on Joystiq. We were on Joystiq.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
When the hell did that happen?

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Oh.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Uh

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
yes they used to do like a weekly

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
podcast thing and I think we were

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
featured once. Actually

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
I remember Playstation Joystiq

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
site did a really

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
nice write up on OLRPSP.com

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
some time ago. That was really cool.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
And I want to say

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
probably when the whole

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
when the whole Katamari

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
thing happened years ago that was probably

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
on Joystiq. The president cat

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
thing was written up on I think that hit

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
a couple blogs and Joystiq was one of them too.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
So it was a while ago. But I know Ricimo has been listening a while.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
So yeah I guess we have got a few mentions.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Now we need to get Gaga Hamster.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Yes which by the

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
way just the Glamster

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
was what we were going to call it.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Kuma JP bless his heart did

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
do some research on Glamster

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
and they don't have a Twitter it seems like.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
But he did get us the website.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
It's Bergsala-lightweight.co.jp

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
So

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
that's

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
I mean so there's the official site and they actually have

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
a website for the Hamster game

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
which had a

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
very long Japanese name that I'm totally

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
mispronouncing. But DarkSakura decided last

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
week to simply call it Glamster which is a

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
fantastic name for it because it was

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
making the hamsters pretty and putting

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
them in pretty situations and so forth and we're

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
like why can't this game be out here. It's like the pretty pretty

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
princess of hamsters. So I wanted to bombard

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
their Twitter and try to take another social

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
media campaign like we did with President

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Kat to its

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
horrendous success. But

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
but

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
no luck. There's no Twitter to bug

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
them through. But we'll

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
keep trying.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Of course you remember the

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Katamari debacle of yesteryear.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
I haven't missed a single episode and felt

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
the need to say thanks for getting me

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
through so many work days. I love you all.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Thanks once again. Sent from my iPhone.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Well that was very nice.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
There was no questions or opinions

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
or I mean opinions. I like nice

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
emails. Thank you. That was just a good old fashioned

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
thank you. Especially

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
there was only one missing comma.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
This is

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
quite pleased. Well and you're

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
welcome and thank you for that.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
It's always really

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
awesome to see things like that. You get

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
an invisible gold star for awesome.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Yeah I got to say I so appreciate

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
the small gestures

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
people have done to just kind of say

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
thanks for all our like you know

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
code man got me Borderlands

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
too because I was bitching about wanting it last week

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
and he was kind enough to get that for me. That means

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
a lot. And I got a trading

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
card I wanted just because somebody

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
had it and was like hey I like

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
all our here have this I know you need it

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
and didn't expect anything in return and I was like

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
that's all. Even though those cards are only like 18

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
cents still it's just like the gesture is like

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
oh my god it's awesome. Usually the small gestures

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I get are lewd.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
I got a wiener for you DarkSakura.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Oh Slidekick found

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
our article.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Some Google foo.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
About the president

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
cat. There you go. Oh he found the

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
he found the article from 2007

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
that was about O.L.R.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
P.S.P.com I believe. This is 2009.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Which apparently no there's another

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
article look at the link there

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
that fixed info on DarkSakura

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
I wonder what they

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
said about you that was wrong who knows.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Anyhow.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I have to see this.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
It's an old article. And I'll tell you what

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
probably updated it the last

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
time they ran that article.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
You know actually I'm getting

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
the emails from GoDaddy

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
to renew OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
which you know obviously that'll happen

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
even though we really need to do something

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
with that website to modernize it a little bit

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
and get it away from the hackers

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
but O.L.R. P.S.P.com

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
is up for renewal and I'm questioning

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
if I should renew it. Probably not.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
However you can still

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
I feel like there's people that'll be pissed off

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
if I let it go. No no no no no no no hold on.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
I just had a Facebook

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
comment the other day. You can still access it

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
by going to OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
slash P.S.P. Oh okay.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
So.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Alright then I feel better letting it go if that's

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
going to be the case. Yeah cause in fact I'll

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
still protect this real quick. You have such a cute kitty

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Brad. Yeah I'm pretty

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
sure it's slash P.S.P.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
I think that actually

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
yes yeah see if you

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com slash P.S.P.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Okay well that's cool. Then then yeah

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I might let O.L.R. P.S.P.com lapse

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
if there's still a way to get to it.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Alright. A lot of these pages

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
don't work anymore. Ranma secret message

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
send me some. I will.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Alright.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Tiger Claw says

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
why not change O.L.R. P.S.P. to a mobile

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
site. No.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Yeah I kind of feel the

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
same. It's like that's a lot of work to maintain

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
and I think a lot of the focus right now

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
is also on building VOG network

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
is kind of like the central hub and making that

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
bigger and better. The network's okay on mobile.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Yeah and that you know I think

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
the next step at some point for VOG will

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
be a mobile app but that's

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
you know in the

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
future. Ways away.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Don't get excited about that. Long

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
ways out. You'll probably see

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
it'll come out around the time Zelda's

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
finally out on Wii U.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Alright.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Let's see.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
That's it for e-mails right?

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Yarr. If you want to send us some

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
e-mails mailbag at orange lounge radio

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
dot com. That means it's the time

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
in the show when we do the FUs

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
of the week.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
My

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
FU goes to this

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
cough that will not go away.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
The conditions of some of the houses we've

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
seen because there were like burnt

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
carpet and cat pee smells.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Some of these like the HUD houses

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
oh my god it's so bad. And then

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
another FU just to the housing industry in

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
general because it's

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
really like this weird

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
huge mungus

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
legal ebay game with

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
houses. It's a pain in the ass.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
But we found a cute one.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
The conditions seem

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
favorable. Not gonna get my hopes

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
up too high but keep your fingers

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
crossed for us. We found a good one.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
And

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Rob it has

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
perfect accommodations for a new studio.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Nice.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
I'll keep my fingers and my toes crossed.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Loki.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Just fuck you because I still don't have

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
a fixed controller yet even though it

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
sort of seems like it's going on the right track.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
I thought the same thing back on July

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
1st and

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
look where we are now. So fuck them.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
That's it? That's it.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
My FU goes to the fact

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
that I can't follow through things on

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
things that I say I'm going to do and

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
convince myself that I'm going to do but then I'm just

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
like, but you

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
can't really do that even though you probably

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
should. Go to the gym Rob.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
It's not even that I'm talking about actually.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
I could put that on the list.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
As one of many things. You should go to the gym

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
with me. I can't because you don't go to the same

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
gym I do. Yes I can.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
I can get guest passes. Hello. You gonna switch?

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
No I can get guest passes.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
That would work like once or twice.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
And then they'd try to bully me into joining and I don't want

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
to join because I like the gym I've got.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Ours has got a heated pool.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Alright. Anyhow.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Back to

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
a couple more news stories in the

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
So

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
I guess that Namco is

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
prepping a HD

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
version of Soul Calibur 2.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Soul Calibur 2 HD Online

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
this fall. I'm assuming

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
it's a download title because I haven't seen

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
anything on here that says that

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
it's gonna be

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
released at retail.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I know I haven't heard of anything yet

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
about retail. But uh

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
yeah apparently the game

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
is gonna be

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
closer to HD now

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
and the outputting at 720p

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
um

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I don't know.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Neat.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
I'm assuming that the special characters aren't gonna be in the game.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
He probably can't get spawner.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
You know obviously Link's not gonna be back

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
because he was only on GameCube.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
And Heihachi.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Yeah.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
So no Link.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Yeah well yeah because that was GameCube.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
So I don't know.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
It's bad it's not coming to Wii U.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Yeah

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
that would be nice wouldn't it.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
But you never know. I mean you never know.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
I'm kinda not getting my hopes up.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Yes.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Yes it does. Be quiet.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Stop trolling.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Alright well one more news story for you guys

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
before we open up the Skype line and uh

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
I gotta say this is a really

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
crazy idea but I totally love it.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
It's a site called

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
All You Can Arcade

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
and you can visit it at allyoucanarcade.com

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
In a nutshell

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
it's basically trying to be like a Netflix type thing

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
for arcade cabinets.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Yes it's a business where arcade

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
rentals are the focus.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
For $75 a month

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
but we're talking cabinets people I know that sounds expensive

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
but basically you can

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
cancel your membership at any time

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
or whatever you sign up for this

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
and you can have 1, 2 or 3

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
games brought to you

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
and you can swap them out for a different one in stock

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
or whatever. Now it's only

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
in certain areas because they bring

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
the games to you which is pretty amazing.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
It's only available in the San Francisco Bay Area

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Stockton, San Jose, Sacramento

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
and Sacramento. Yes Sacramento

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
has it. So if

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Dark Soccer wanted to do this or whatever

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
And I have a job now. Can we check this

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
stock? And they're saying

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
in order to help scale the business we're partnering

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
with other arcade coin operators and have our

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
have set our website up so that anyone who

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
owns a game can become an operator by listing

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
photos of their games for rent. They can also

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
set how far of a territory they're willing to cover

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
on their route and our system will automatically

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
find visitors who live within those zip codes

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
and match their games with local homes and offices

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
that want to rent them. This is actually aimed

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
at private collectors too

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
which is crazy.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
I mean it's very ambitious.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
I should probably share that with Dan's

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
pinball group. Yeah I mean

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
I didn't see if there were actually

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
but yeah some of the cabinets they have on here

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
most of them are old stuff but still

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
you know bad dudes

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Ms. Pacman looking at the site

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
which we're totally just giving him free advertising

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
here but whatever it's a neat

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
idea and it's really taking the Netflix

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
thing to the next level isn't it? I love the totally

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
fake picture though. Oh yeah

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
these little gals playing in the game

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
and having fun. And the little black dresses and heels. Dude

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
versus Goonies that's awesome I want that.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
That's cool.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Where can you view what they have?

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
All You Can Arcade dot com. Yeah I went there.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Signing up and

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Oh you can actually browse games available in my area.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Wow. Where? I put in my zip code here

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
just in the upper right corner. Okay.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Bad Dudes, Berserk,

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Donkey Kong, Galaga,

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Golden Tee. This isn't all

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
of them I'm just looking at. Heavy Barrel is a good one.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Silkworm. Yes.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
What? Silkworm. Dance of the Revolution Extreme.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Ha Ha. Get out

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
really? Yes.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Oh my

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
God there is a DDR

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
machine. But you were just looking at area.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Oh yeah I was

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
looking at area. This is looking at Sacramento.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
It might not be available in your area necessarily.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
But

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
still that's the type of game they're willing to

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
rent. One might show up Loki.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
They need a 2DX on that list. Oh boy.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
I will rent it forever.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Alright. Yeah I may

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
have to hog that if I actually. Hey if the idea

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
does well and I just totally gave them

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
free advertising. Dude

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
I would totally just want to buy

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
that. It's kind of neat.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
So anyway. There you go.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
That's it. That's it for the stories we had on deck

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
tonight. So we're going to open up our Skype line if you

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
want to give us a call. 1877

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Game OLR. Our username on Skype is

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
JoshLoungeRadio. If there's something you want to talk about tonight

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
that we haven't brought up. We'll get to Twitter topics in a minute

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
here. But first some last minute stories.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Darsakha I think you said you had one tonight right?

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I do and I seriously thought I'd put it

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
in my stories and I

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
didn't. So this

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
goes out to all the homestucks.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Basically Hussey. Oh God. Shut up.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Basically Hussey is

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
going to be working with Namco

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
doing a dating sim.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
The game is called Namco High

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
and it is a fictional

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
crossover high school that all

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
the Namco characters are going to.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
So it's yeah date high school

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
sim and

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
so basically

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
it's going to be Namco

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
character shipping the game.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Like everybody does with Homestuck.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
So we're looking at characters from

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Xenogears, Tekken

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Idolmaster

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Bites and Kratos so

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
here

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
we go with Pac-Man. That sounds weird.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
I'm totally getting it.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
That's weird it's like that one sim that they had

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
where you date like birds.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Oh

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Hat's a Full Boyfriend.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Alright let's go to the phones.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Hi you're on Orange on a Treaty who's this?

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
It's the one and only Rama.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Rama how's it going?

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Good good. I just got a

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
brand new mixer on Saturday.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Oh congrats. So we're going to be hearing

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
even more high

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
fidelity anime jam sessions soon.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Either that or lots of margaritas.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
That'll happen

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
provided Junami doesn't knock the desk

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
over. Don't invite him to your house.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I told him he

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
had to sign a release form first.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
In Junami's

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
defense he came over on the 4th of July and didn't

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
knock anything over. Good job. No

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
he actually needs to come back to the show.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
It's been far too long.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
That sounds pretty cool.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Well congrats on your new mixing board. What else is up?

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Not much

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
but I want to

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
stand behind Loki

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
and join him

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
in the lynching of

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Uya because I have my own issues when it comes

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
to gaming customer service and

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
I was just close to literally

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
losing my shit on Facebook and

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Twitter before they got

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
back to me.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Why don't you air your grievances here?

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Long story short

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
I bought a headset

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
by Astro Gaming because I played

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
them at PAX East last year and I

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
loved them. So what happened was

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
there was a short in the headset or

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
the mic was dead. After

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
waiting for the perfect time to pack up

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
everything I pack up

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
the microphone, the headset and the mixer

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
because I was having troubles with that too.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Sent it out. Two weeks later I get

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
a brand new mixer

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
a brand new microphone

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
same headset. And I'm looking

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
at the new mixer and they're telling me the battery

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
that I had works for it but

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
the new mixer doesn't use the battery.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
There's a couple extra connectors on there

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I can't even use my optical out because they

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
change that. So I'm like whatever

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I can work with it. I can still do my

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
podcasting and the music and so forth.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Plug in the mic. Everything is working

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
well. A week later

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
the mic starts shorting out

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
again. So

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
I contact them and I'm like

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
okay what they're probably going to do is send me a

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
new kit. I pack up everything and send it

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
back. They're like no we need you to pack up

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
everything. Send it to us and we'll send it

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
back to you. And I'm like

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
I use this for every day. I can't be

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
without it. They should say

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
okay we'll send you a two day

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
UPS label.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
I'm like you're not helping me here.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
So I

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
end up going on their Twitter, their support

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Twitter asking for help. I go

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
on their Facebook asking for

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
help explaining everything

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
and I actually went as far as when I was

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
at PAX East this year speaking to our

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
rep at their booth to get this taken

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
care of. Wow that's dedication

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
to the cause. I packed

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
up all my equipment took it down.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
It's because I actually like

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
the quality of the equipment. It's just

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
their customer service sucks. And

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
every email I get back from them

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
they don't

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
have everything commented back. I've been sending

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
an email. They keep responding back with

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
the original complaint on the open

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
ticket. I'm like are you guys not

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
reading this? I'm sending them

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
specific information about what's going on

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
and how I want the situation resolved.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
I get a generic response

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
coming back. Friday I

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
check Twitter. I get a private message from

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
their support saying they're so

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
sorry since nothing has happened.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
No one's gotten back to me and it's been

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
30 days. I get in my email

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
an actual phone

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
number where I can call them and talk to them

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
and explain the whole situation.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Wow.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
But did that actually fix it finally?

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Not yet because this past weekend

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
I took a semi sort of sabbatical.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
I just stepped away.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Just did my own thing. Tomorrow

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
I'm going to call and just get this

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
taken care of. Because like I said

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
the headsets, the mixers.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
The stuff's really good. I can't complain

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
because I use it for podcasting.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Listening to music. Gaming on

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
my consoles. But when it just

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
comes to support it's just like it lacks

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
and people's defenses.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
They're mostly an online based

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
company. You're going to

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
be able to only contact them via email.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
I'm like no. There are other online

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
companies where you can contact them not just through

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
the forums. Support. Email.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Phone number. All that stuff.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Sadly I think there's a few too many companies

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
willing to cut corners on customer service

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
and it shows.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Yeah.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Alright well anything else. Any other grievances

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
you want to air on tonight's OLR?

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
That's it. I'll just say this. If you

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
buy this, buy it from Best Buy.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Get their service plan.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
It'll save you a lot of frustration

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
and hair on your head. Fair enough.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Alright. You take care Rama.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
You too bro. Alright. Bye bye.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Alright. Always good to hear from our buddy Rama.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here at

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
The Voice Eagles Network. Totally.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
We wait for more calls at 1877

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Game OLR or our username on Skype

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Orange Launch Radio. Loki do you have anything for last minutes?

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I don't have any last minute stories

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
but I'd like to once again

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
because I threw around this idea on

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Twitter and now I think I'm going to move

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
forward with it which is

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
the Loki's 24 hour

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
total noob game jam

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
basically an experiment

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
because I've been going through this whole

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
game making thing and actually just

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
reading up a lot on programming

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
and unity and all that fun stuff

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
and now I just want to get my hands dirty

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
with it and so

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
the experience basically

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I'm going to spend 24 hours putting the

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
other game. Now obviously unlike

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
regular game jams I don't have enough time

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
to sit. It's not 24

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
consecutive hours. Yes. Hold on because our

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
phone's lighting up. We'll come back to

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
your thoughts in a minute here but let's go to

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
the phones. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
who's this? Hey hey hey

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
it's lokilives46. Hey it's

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
say that again it's

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
lokilives46

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
lokilives46 but

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
no relation to rloki?

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
No no no unfortunately not.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I guess it is a commonly

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
used name from. Wait where did you

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
get yours? Yours did not come from

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
like Thor or anything. Yours came from

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
the mask. I'm a fan of Jim Carrey. The mask

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
way back when right? But some people

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Yes yes I was originally

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
it's actually a bit of a persona

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
I've taken up. Oh.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Yeah it was a very

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
mischievous little brat. Wait so yours is

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
inspired from the mask too?

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Absolutely. Wow.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
You guys are kind of like distant cousins

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
distant cousins or something. Alright.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Well I won't make you talk about your name anymore

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
loki2

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
or loki46.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
What's on your mind tonight?

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Just sort of

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
clearing up the discrepancies here but

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
I'm a bit of a

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
tech geek myself.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Well so are we. You're in good

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
company here at the Voice Geeks Network. I think we're all

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
a little nerdy.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Anyways how have things been going for you guys?

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
What's that? How have things been going

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
for you guys?

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Fantastic.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
How are you doing

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
DarkSakura? That's what the listeners want

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
to know. How the hell are you? I want this house.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
You want this house that you're looking at?

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
She's house hunting. I'm longing.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Yes. But I'm employed now so

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
that's good. And our loki is full of

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
gummy bears but he just ran to the kitchen real quick.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Those gummy bears

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I pity his poor soul right now.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Fine. What you're not a gummy bear fan?

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
What's up with that? No

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
it's just that high concentration of sugar.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I'm allergic to them. No I already

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
ate some of them but

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
there's no way I'm going to eat a ton of them.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
They'll seriously make me feel sick.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Alright fair enough.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Anyways I'll let you guys get back to it.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Okay fair enough. No games you want to talk

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
about tonight or anything? What have you been playing?

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
I've just been crazy busy

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
with work so I haven't really had a chance to.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Well you better

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
get on that last

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
day of the steam sale. Last chance

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
he gains at a discount put all that money

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
to use.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Oh my wallet doesn't like those steam sales

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
I'll tell you that much.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Alright buddy well thanks for the call you take

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
care. Yeah you too. Alright bye.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
He just

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
called to ask how the hell are you?

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Alive and kicking.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
It's hot. It's very courteous.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Yeah it is a little hot isn't it? It's not even

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
like one of those. It's getting hot in here.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
I'll make sure the AC is on while

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I think it doesn't. Aren't you guys cooking a pizza

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
or something? Oh yeah he's making a baked

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
potato or something. Yeah I see.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
I'm sure these walls are really insulated

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
with the oven beaver. Yeah sorry.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Alright well while I make sure our AC

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
is at full blast

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
so it's not 24 consecutive

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
hours. Not 24 consecutive hours because I just can't

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I can't get that amount of free time

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
anymore.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
So it'll be 24 hours total but it's

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
kind of cool because what I'm hoping to do

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
is actually have some well

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
I want to live stream it

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
we'll see if that's feasible or not depending on

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
where I actually have to record and the times and that

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
kind of stuff. I would like to live

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
stream. At the very least it's going to go up on YouTube

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
and I want some sort

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
of interactivity with that

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
so obviously chat room

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
will be involved and

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
I want to actually have polls at different parts

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
you know during it

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
like the first is going to be I think

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
you know what concept should we go

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
because I can make anything so

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
what are we going to make you know

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I'll come up with like a couple ideas

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
and then maybe people vote on it and we'll go from

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
there and then later on as we get more

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
into it and hell I don't know

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
if I'll actually create a game in 24 hours because I've

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
never made anything before but I think I

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
can do it. I love how you're doing your game jam

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I've never made a game before but I'm pretty

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
sure I could do one in 24 hours. Maybe

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
I don't know.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
We'll try it I mean look at hell

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I watched a video where someone made a game in 3 minutes

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
I mean it can be done it's just it's

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
going to be a good game

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
It's like the noob night

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
that Bobby and I keep talking about for

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Borderlands 2 except your noob night is

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
programming. Yeah I think it'd be fun

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
I just kind of want to do it so yeah

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
as Bobby suggested make a poll on the

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
forums so yeah I'll start off with doing that and we'll

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
do updates in there and stuff

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
and see where it goes

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
because I think it'd be fun. I think you should try to make one

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
of the OLR dream games. No no see I knew you would

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
say that I knew you would say that but here's why

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
I don't want to do that because I want to make if I'm going to make

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
one of those it's got to be a good game I don't want to make

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
my first experiment at like something that's going to suck

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
one of those

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
games no offense it's just you know

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
I'd rather do it when I'm able to make something

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
a little bit better you know

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
it's a dream game after all we're not going to like just

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
crap out something. Fair enough

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
you want to make sure that it's

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
the time is taken to get it right. Besides I have a lot of

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
really crazy ideas for things

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
I mean all sorts of silly

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
things. Alright let me quickly

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
go to some tweets at twitter.com slash

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
OLR looking at

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
a few tweets here s2100

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Matt tweeted us about going to

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
EA's NHL 94 anniversary

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
mode party in New York City and

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
he actually took some footage that he posted over

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
on Facebook and yeah I saw

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
that earlier in the week and it looks pretty cool

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
I like how they put that mode in there

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
to kind of you know with the stars under the

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
player and all that to kind of go back to the classic

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
and I heard EA

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
didn't really like him taking some of that footage but

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I'm glad his rogue footage

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
made it to Facebook after all.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Tigerclaw sending us a couple tweets

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Oculus Rift is planned for PC

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
and mobile but consoles not a focus

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
which I suppose would go

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
a ways in wasn't there some

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
rumor about Playstation 4

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
getting Oculus Rift at some point I want to say

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
right around E3 there was some wank on that

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Honestly it can support any platform

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
it's just it's HDMI inputs

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
it's basically

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
it just has to output that display and it

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
can work with pretty much anything so

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
well

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
actually no I take that back it's a little bit more complex

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
than that but yeah I think they said consoles

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
that you know one time and

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
obviously if it has native support for

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Unreal 4 you know

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
both consoles can run that

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
and

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
you know source and I'm not really sure what

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
other engines are going to be supporting it natively

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
but more and more are

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
supporting it so I wouldn't see why not

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Alright also Tigerclaw

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
letting us know that a new side scrolling Teenage Mutant

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Ninja Turtles game is coming in October

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Activision

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
talked about this in a press release it's based on the

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Nickelodeon version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
You know they're doing a new movie right? Yeah I knew that

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
With Megan Fox

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Yeah I heard about that

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Pass

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Also lastly Spazinator

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
on Twitter wants to know after the

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
show is over anyone up for a game

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
of Left 4 Dead 2 or if not

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Left 4 Dead 2 then Civ 4

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
I'm up for a game of driving home

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Here's the thing well I would play Civ

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
5 but not on Sunday night because I got to go

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
to work tomorrow you got to catch me on the weekend

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
and you got to book that shit in advance

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
but yeah sadly

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
I can't tonight because Alan and I have errands

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
to run after the show but I will invite

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
the other listeners if you want to play some Left 4

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Dead 2 which is a game a lot of people own on Steam

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
go meet

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Raginator or Spazinator whatever he's called

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
go meet him in our VOG Network group

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
and get a game going he wants to

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
kill some zombies with you have fun

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Alright

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Well I guess that's going to do it for our Skype line tonight

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
and I

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
guess it's going to start to do it for the end of our show

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
It's starting to get really hot in here you

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
guys it's been a hot day in Sacramento

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
and then we're running the oven right now because

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
I guess Alan started dinner so it's like

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
I think it's time for us to wrap

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
up and get on out of here so sorry it was a little bit

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
shorter of a show tonight but we'll be back next week

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
to do it all over again

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Won't we? Yay

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
I guess

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
and you guys will hopefully be here too

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
at live.vognetwork.com

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
I guess

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
But before we end the show we have to go around and give everybody's

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
final thought

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
DarkSakura your final thought tonight

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Um

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Words

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Loki your final thought tonight

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Uh

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I wonder how long it's going to take me to get all those

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
coming bears

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
My final thought is

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
I'm going to need to really convince myself

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
not to buy Rogue Legacy

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
while it's at least 20%

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
off during the Steam sale and I was holding out

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
for a deeper discount or

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
else I'm probably going to end up buying that later tonight

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
because I do want to get that I've heard a lot of good things about it

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Damn it

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Damn you Steam sale

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
You should have gotten Little Inferno Damn you

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Or do you have it? I still might you never know

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
It's fun Rob

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
