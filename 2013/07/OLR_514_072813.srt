[SPEAKER_00]: A report is in on Ouya game sales, which might surprise you.

4
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:27,346
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get more insight as to why one fan-anticipated game was cancelled.

5
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:45,543
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this July the 28th of 2013, episode number 514 of our show.

00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:49,207

8
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,869
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:56,214
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:57,195
[SPEAKER_04]: TechMasterLoki

11
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:17,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello!

12
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,118
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing Techmaster Loki?

13
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:20,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting full though.

14
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:21,520
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting full?

15
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have another burger.

16
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Another burger to down.

17
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:26,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's right, you've ditched your fries in favor of two burgers.

18
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:27,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not today.

19
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:30,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually wanted to get fries today just because I was a little hungry.

20
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:32,188
[SPEAKER_04]: You're being a little bit of a piggy today.

21
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,410
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're good fries.

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually they're not good fries.

23
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:42,375
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of the Russian roulette of drive-thru fast food, I guess.

24
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:43,977
[SPEAKER_11]: McDonald's fries.

25
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:54,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you do listen to our show live, you can check in and show that you're participating with the show.

[SPEAKER_04]: No, but okay.

31
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:23,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like a personal problem, Rob.

32
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:24,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

33
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:34,652
[SPEAKER_04]: As Jamie referenced a minute ago, last night was the big clue show, and I'm sure those of you that do listen to Understation Live here at the Voice Geeks Network, you've probably heard Jessica talking about it, and I've referenced it too.

34
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:43,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the big show last night, which, you know, not only was the show, but all day leading up to that show, and then all week leading up to the show, and the Saturdays before that.

[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so I took a Tylenol PM last night, which I don't usually do.

42
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:49,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm feeling really groggy today.

43
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:53,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I can't kick this grog thing I've got going on.

44
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've just decided during tonight's show, you know what?

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck it.

46
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, Alan.

47
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, do we have any wine?

48
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yes, we have like four bottles.

49
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:03,293
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want?

50
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:04,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't care.

51
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:05,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I want wine.

52
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:09,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what it is, but serve it to me in a Coke bottle.

53
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

54
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:20,663
[SPEAKER_04]: So the wonderful Alan is over there right now cracking open a bottle of wine for me so I can have a little bit of a celebratory drink because it was a really kick-ass weekend.

55
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:21,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that.

56
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:22,725
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:44,322
[SPEAKER_04]: and so it actually kind of made me go like, wow, why don't I do this more often?

58
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:50,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, oh yeah, I have a three hour radio show every week where I get to kind of practice the speaking skills a little bit.

[SPEAKER_04]: It is extremely sweet and extremely fruity.

68

00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Entire... What?

75
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,240
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually really good.

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,020
[SPEAKER_09]: It tastes like candy.

77
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it?

78
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,861
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually tastes like sweet tarts.

79
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:21,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

80
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:22,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't it?

81
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,741
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from a local winery.

82
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,482
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually drive out there to the winery.

83
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:26,542
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only about a 30-minute drive.

84
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:27,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time you go, grab me a bottle.

85
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:29,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, I'll pay you for it.

86
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:33,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com His legs are smooth.

87
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:51,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm beardless for the first time in a couple years, I think, at this point.

88
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:55,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I used to, like, for most of my 20s, I didn't have a beard.

89
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:56,869
[SPEAKER_09]: The last time you did it was for Rocky, wasn't it?

90
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:57,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Or for Repo.

91
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Rocky or Repo, one of those.

92
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:04,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, last night, Colonel Mustard, who I was playing in the movie, only has a mustache.

93
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:11,540
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took it down to my porn stash yesterday, which the minute I walk out of the bathroom, Alan goes, Oh, Freddie Mercury, I love your work.

94
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:12,701
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, fuck off.

95
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:18,365
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I shaved off the mustache last night, so now I'm clean shaven again.

96
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:19,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Did the show must go on?

97
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:20,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

98
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:24,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to break free.

99
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

100
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:27,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Was your makeup flaking, but still?

101
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:52,527
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so I'm trying to grow back at least some scruff for GamerX Because I'm going from one busy weekend to another GamerX is next weekend in San Francisco We will not be here live because of it I'm sorry, sorry about it But I won't be back on Sunday night for the show So unfortunately, Studio OLR will be closed on Sunday So Loki, you get a week off to do whatever And DarkSakura, you can come feed Sanrio

102
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:53,988
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

103
00:06:54,329 --> 00:07:01,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Gamer X would probably just be like the ultimate dream of any convention because I don't know.

104
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,038
[SPEAKER_09]: It just would be fun.

105
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:04,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You love gay men and women.

106
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:07,282
[SPEAKER_04]: You love video games.

107
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:10,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm expecting that there will also be more bathed people.

108
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:12,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm hoping for that too.

109
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's going to be a good time.

110
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Fabulous people, fabulous games, and no con funk.

111
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:21,201
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what they need to do.

112
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And this goes for pretty much any con.

113
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it might annoy some people and stuff.

114
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:28,703
[SPEAKER_11]: But they need to have... What was it?

115
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, what the fuck is that place now?

116
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:33,945
[SPEAKER_11]: The place with all the stinky fucking shit.

117
00:07:37,023 --> 00:08:06,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep wanting to say Bed Bath & Beyond but it's not Bed Bath & Beyond it's uh Perfumania god damn I don't remember the place now Bath & Body Works there you go they need to have a booth there because their stores fucking reek but they reek of like flowery stuff not con funk so you get them you put them in the middle of the con and then it just kind of averages itself out I was there at the AX that people were passing out um hygiene bags it was the last AX I went to by the way

118
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, this is important to say.

119
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,256
[SPEAKER_04]: GamerX is not just for gay people.

120
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:12,877

00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:56,919
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

146
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:59,401
[SPEAKER_11]: What's recognized by FemShep?

147
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:00,882
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's mass affecting.

148
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:01,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

149
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:02,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh, whatever.

150
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:03,443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all fine.

151
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, my blogs are cool.

152
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:07,212
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

153
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:46,873
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I'm going to be going back to, I'm going to be changing my live stream night once I'm out of training because I will be working on Thursdays.

154
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:51,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So my streaming will probably be earlier in the day.

155
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:58,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably, I have to find, make sure it's pre some show or something like that, but.

156
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of live streaming, Bobby wanted me to throw a plug out here and this will be fun.

157
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:07,674
[SPEAKER_04]: He will be live streaming Saints Row 4 on August 14th is the day he's going to do that.

158
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:11,155
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be exciting.

159
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:16,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm probably going to finish my Mass Effect 3 stream just because I've beaten that game 27,000 times.

160
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, no, I think I'm on my 20th playthrough.

161
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So, anyway.

162
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:27,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so yeah, I will be finishing up that, that if I can keep it from lagging from the high res graphics that I plugged in, I don't know why it's doing it.

163
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:30,202
[SPEAKER_09]: My computer is more than capable of handling it.

164
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:38,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, and then, um, I'll be, I'll be announcing that when that starts back up on mass affecting.tumblr.com plug, plug.

165
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:43,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, in the interim, I am actually making stuff for video games.

166
00:11:44,230 --> 00:12:11,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I am going to be making little slip pockets for 3DS I will be making them in XL size and as soon as I have everything set up I will be doing I think my first batch is going to be in Tetris fabric so anyone's interested talk to me fun yeah but yeah Animal Crossing and pinball what kind of pinball what games the stuff in my house you need some pinball games for your 3DS

167
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:28,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I need some other games for my 3DS well we borrowed Fire Emblem from George but Dan wanted to play the previous Fire Emblem first so he went and bought that there is another game going on in my house and that is Phantasy Star Generation 1 the Sega Ages one

168
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:46,680
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically I've been replacing all of the music in Animal Crossing for the updated Phantasy Star So everything sounds like combat from Phantasy Star in Animal Crossing It's been very, very weird

169
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:48,272
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

170
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:50,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on then.

171
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:51,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

172
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't play a whole ton this week.

173
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:55,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a little bit of Borderlands 2.

174
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:58,064
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a few hours.

175
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I got all my cards in one sitting.

176
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,029
[SPEAKER_11]: So I played...

177
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:16,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Up through level 9, and I'm at, I just got the Sanctuary, so that's, you know, my, like, fourth time playing through this game, I swear, because I played through it on console.

178
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:21,203
[SPEAKER_11]: I played through it on the Xbox, like, three times, so it's like, ooh, I've already done this before.

179
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,944
[SPEAKER_11]: But, so, yeah, I'll do that, and...

180
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

181
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I do it all the time.

182
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,291
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

183
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:46,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I did play Super Meat Boy a little bit this week as well.

184
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:49,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's it though.

185
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:55,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I have Shadowrun Returns because they finally sent me the code from kickstarting that.

186
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:58,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I did get to download that.

187
00:13:58,743 --> 00:13:59,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played it yet.

188
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:01,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Although it looks fun.

189
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:12,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Video Game High School Season 2 Episode 1 came out this week and it was fantastic and long because now they're all 30 minute long episodes instead of like 5 minute episodes.

190
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:17,195
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like between 6 and 15 minute episodes last season.

191
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,397
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks interesting.

192
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:20,778
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cool.

193
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:26,401
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't get a chance to download their high frame rate version yet but the trailer was kind of neat.

194
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:31,385
[SPEAKER_11]: How they have 48 frames per second for the video game stuff and then 24 for everything else.

195
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:35,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but it's entertaining and they've had a lot of cameos in there.

196
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:42,053
[SPEAKER_11]: There's already been a Stan Lee cameo and, um, a Cliffy B cameo already in there.

197
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:43,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's it.

198
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:45,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so that's what that guy's been up to.

199
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:45,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

200
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:49,579
[SPEAKER_11]: He, he was like, he was a judge for some, something, you know?

201
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:50,379
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

202
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,981
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, it was, it was cool.

203
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:53,542
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

204
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:18,354
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I played it again later in the week and it's a lot of fun.

205
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:24,837
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like one of those like Metroidvania type of games but the castle each time you play is randomly generated.

206
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:39,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say each time you play I mean each time you die and you come back as somebody else because that's the whole trick in Rogue Legacy is that you revive as the descendant of the last hero that you played as who will have some very different and unique traits.

207
00:15:39,864 --> 00:16:07,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Such as they might be more of a paladin who, you know, has a shield Or they might be somebody who's a giant Or they might be somebody who has Tourette's So they just randomly have a little Q-Bert swear cloud that comes up Or somebody who has, they start to do some interesting and a little bit controversial ones They have one with dyslexia where all the letters when people talk will get switched around Like randomly And the vertigo one was a pain in the ass That's where the entire thing is flipped

208
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:26,884
[SPEAKER_04]: so like you're walking on the ceiling and all that oh my gosh that thing ticked me off uh but yeah that you a lot of fun because you collect as much gold as you can when you go to the castle and you can buy power-ups that all the future people will get to use but in order to go back in the castle you have to give up all your gold on hand

209
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:49,266
[SPEAKER_04]: so it really is about get as much gold as you can make the next hero a little stronger so he can get further he or she make get as much as you can make the next hero stronger and so on and so on and each time it's random although at one point you can hire somebody like I think it's an architect they call it and the architect will allow you to keep the same castle as the last generation but you'll only get 40% of the gold

210
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a brilliant little trick in the game.

211
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:57,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked it a lot.

212
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:02,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, you'd be a lot better at the vertigo levels if you played more Strider.

213
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:06,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if I turned my monitor upside down when those came up.

214
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:09,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Or played a lot more VVVVV.

215
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:10,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

216
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just don't pick those guys moving forward, which is my plan.

217
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:19,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you get to pick from which one of three descendants do you want to play as.

218
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:24,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I did the Vertigo one for the LOL on the feed when I was broadcasting, but no more of those.

219
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:27,583
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of one of those you do it once for the laughs and then that's it.

220
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:29,725
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that was Rogue Legacy.

221
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:36,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby and I finally had our much advertised and talked about Borderlands Noob Night on Tuesday.

222
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:37,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I missed that.

223
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:38,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I didn't read my tweets and I...

224
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:41,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we tagged you in it just to see if you were going to drop in.

225
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:47,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually played from the start of the game to about level 7-ish.

226
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we were in like chapter 3 or something by the time we stopped.

227
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:53,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, we played a pretty good chunk of the game.

228
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:58,527
[SPEAKER_11]: So did you finish Captain Flint or did you... Yes, I think that was the last guy we killed.

229
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:00,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we got on a boat and we were taken somewhere else.

230
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:02,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so you're in chapter 4 then.

231
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:03,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, was it really?

232
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

233
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:06,393
[SPEAKER_11]: The first few chapters are fast.

234
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,034
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

235
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,033
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was fun.

236
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:32,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we had a good time, and I think we entertained the folks that were watching us broadcasting on Twitch.

237
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:36,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I'm really bad at first-person shooters.

238
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:45,222
[SPEAKER_04]: But the cool thing about Borderlands 2 is that, like, the character I was playing had a little, like... Once you got to level 5, you got a little gun turret that you can place on the ground.

239
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:46,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll automatically shoot people.

240
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:47,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was cool.

241
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bobby was playing the Mechromancer, who is the...

242
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:52,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

243
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:40,373
[SPEAKER_04]: now when Borderlands 2 was on sale on Steam I was gifted a copy of Borderlands 2 by a great listener and I picked up the season pass myself because I'm like alright well I know I'm going to want to do all the DLC and all the other stuff that's out right now so I'm just going to pick up the season pass and that way I'll have it when I want to play well when I go in to play the game again the second time later in the week I went back in the game I'm like I'm going to try this again but this time I'm going to do the Mechomancer she's locked

244
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,275
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm like, wait a minute, I should have this because I bought the season pass.

245
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:48,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do some research and I'm like, wait a minute, the season pass is showing on my account, what's going on?

246
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:52,640
[SPEAKER_04]: The characters aren't included in the season pass.

247
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,941
[SPEAKER_04]: She was a pre-order bonus.

248
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:58,084
[SPEAKER_04]: See, and that's the line I've been getting from a lot of people.

249
00:19:58,424 --> 00:20:01,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, okay, she was a pre-order bonus, but they're still selling her.

250
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

251
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:08,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody's going to agree with me, and that's fine, but we all get opinions, so take it or leave it.

252
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:15,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think when they're selling this as a season pass and they're leaving parts out, that's a little bit disingenuous to me.

253
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:20,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And you may argue with me on that, and that's fine, but to me, it's like picking up, like...

254
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:28,209
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get a season pass, like when I pick up Lost Season 7 on DVD, Episode 4 is suddenly missing.

255
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:31,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, Episode 4 was a pre-order bonus only.

256
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:35,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not how it works, yo.

257
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:40,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's more appropriately titled as a bundle.

258
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:41,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're selling.

259
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,036
[SPEAKER_04]: You're selling a DLC bundle.

260
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:44,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah.

261
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:47,938
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't gotten into it yet, but for Saints Row 4, it's like...

262
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:49,639
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

263
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:10,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but they didn't market it as something that like, you know, season pass I think implies a particular thing.

264
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:12,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe this is just a terminology thing in our industry.

265
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:18,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been here before with the whole download content that's actually on a disc.

266
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:21,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we were all sitting here on the show saying that is not DLC.

267
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:23,757
[SPEAKER_04]: That is pay to unlock content.

268
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:24,798
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what it is.

269
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:29,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I'm saying is that the Borderlands 2 season pass is not a season pass.

270
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,001
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a DLC bundle.

271
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:32,061
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what it is.

272
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:33,782
[SPEAKER_04]: You can disagree with me if you want.

273
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:40,787
[SPEAKER_04]: that's fine, that's my opinion it's not a season pass, it's missing some episodes sensible so, anyhow

274
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, that doesn't reflect on my opinion of the game.

275
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:48,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think it's a fine game.

276
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:53,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think even if you don't like first person shooters, I think it's just got a really, you know, it's got a neat story.

277
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:58,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got some cool mechanics that are reminiscent of like an MMO and so forth.

278
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very Diablo-esque.

279
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And co-op mode is a lot of fun.

280
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:02,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that.

281
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:06,543
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that was just my one little thing that did irk me a little bit.

282
00:22:06,563 --> 00:22:09,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you find yourself comparing guns a lot?

283
00:22:09,184 --> 00:22:11,105
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like going, ooh, ooh.

284
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:12,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have the passive-aggressive gun?

285
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:15,086
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not yet, I don't think.

286
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:17,947
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you had been a better shot, you wouldn't have been wasting bullets.

287
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:18,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Those cost money, you know.

288
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:24,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It was tough in co-op because what I'm used to in Diablo is that everybody gets their own loot.

289
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,331
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't happen in Borderlands, so if Bobby picks up all the ammo, I'm stuck.

290
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:31,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Not exactly.

291
00:22:31,912 --> 00:22:33,433
[SPEAKER_11]: It will pool ammo, I think.

292
00:22:33,473 --> 00:22:33,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, will it?

293
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it pooled money.

294
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:36,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it will pool ammo.

295
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:39,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, my bad.

296
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:40,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the question I have to ask about this.

297
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:42,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got Borderlands 2 now.

298
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:44,996
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have the first one because I got it for free back in the day.

299
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:48,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have any benefit to finishing the first one before starting the second?

300
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,618
[SPEAKER_11]: No benefit from finishing... Well, a story, I guess.

301
00:22:51,638 --> 00:23:00,801
[SPEAKER_11]: You get to learn a little bit more of the backstory of different characters because they do end up in the game as NPCs, so you know who this person is when you go and see them.

302
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:06,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Aside from that, the only other bonus you get is you get some unlockable skins when you play the first game.

303
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:11,849
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to have a save file from the first game, so just play for five minutes to get a save file going and then play Borderlands 2.

304
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:15,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, I mean, I watched Dan play the first one, you know, and I got so motion sick.

305
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:21,156
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm planning on playing through Borderlands 2 and calling it a barfest when I stream it.

306
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:22,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

307
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm planning on streaming it.

308
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,060
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a third-person mode that you can unlock via hack.

309
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:28,871
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com.

310
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:48,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster says, it would have been nice if the season pass weren't limited to only for the four DLC campaigns, but would allow you to pick which four DLC you would want for the entire season.

311
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:49,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like that.

312
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:54,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, again, I don't think season pass is the name for that, but I really like the idea of pick them and choose them.

313
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:56,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the thing.

314
00:23:56,884 --> 00:24:02,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have bought the Mechamancer separately in addition to the season pass if I'd known.

315
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:09,513
[SPEAKER_04]: and I will take some accountability for not reading thoroughly as I should have but it's just kind of like a certain thing is sort of implied by that.

316
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:13,937
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was with you because I was like looking at the Mechamencer thing and I saw that it was separate too.

317
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:15,519
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't actually that that I noticed.

318
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,642
[SPEAKER_11]: It was I was going through some skins because I

319
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:20,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I modded it to unlock all the skins.

320
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:22,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I was going through the skins.

321
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:23,867
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, oh, I want to wear that one.

322
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:25,949
[SPEAKER_11]: And it popped me to the Steam store.

323
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:30,094
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, why does it show me stuff that's in there that I don't have?

324
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:31,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you want me to buy it?

325
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:32,696
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not going to buy it.

326
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:34,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Dangling the carrot in front of you.

327
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,100
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, all that other...

328
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,900
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what STO does, by the way.

329
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,881
[SPEAKER_04]: All that other junk.

330
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, STO's a free-to-play game, too, so you cut at some different concessions.

331
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:49,523
[SPEAKER_09]: But for paid outfits, it gives you the option of setting up that outfit, and then when you load the outfit on your character when you're making them, it says, this is pay XX amount.

332
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:50,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, gotcha.

333
00:24:50,983 --> 00:25:03,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of free-to-play, the other game I've been playing this week, and I really can't explain how this happened, but I've sunk in about five, six hours in Dota 2, Defense of the Ancients 2, which is a free game.

334
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:05,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, there's probably some people out there going, what?

335
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:08,068
[SPEAKER_04]: League of Legends League of Legends League of Legends

336
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:27,743
[SPEAKER_04]: have influence from the original mod called Defense of the Ancients that was in Warcraft 3.

337
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:34,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an insanely popular mod to the game, just like Team Fortress was a popular mod to Quake, and so on.

338
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:36,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes mods become their own little thing.

339
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:40,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So Defense of the Ancients became its own game, essentially.

340
00:25:40,187 --> 00:25:45,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So Valve has the Dota 2, there's League of Legends, and there's all these other games that are inspired by it, too.

341
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:47,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard's going to have their own thing.

342
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:49,769
[SPEAKER_04]: All-Stars, I think is what it's called.

343
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:51,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Heroes of Newerth

344
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:17,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing with Dota 2.

345
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:34,283
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think what happened is I was looking around the community marketplace, I was looking at the trading cards, the value of cards, and I was looking at some of the stuff that was in Dota 2, like that was up there on the marketplace, and I decided to just launch the game because I wanted to see, because apparently I had some stuff from Dota 2 for just being in the beta.

346
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:36,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to launch the game and see what it was all about.

347
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:41,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed right away when I launched the game, the launcher looked different than it did before.

348
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, this is laid out all differently.

349
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:46,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And it threw me right into this tutorial mode.

350
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:48,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to learn how to start playing the game?

351
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:49,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, all right, whatever.

352
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:50,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to sit here.

353
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:53,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get it when I played League of Legends, but maybe I'll get it this time.

354
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:54,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started to play.

355
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:56,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the first tutorial.

356
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:57,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the second tutorial.

357
00:26:57,956 --> 00:26:58,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kept playing.

358
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:00,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I was.

359
00:27:00,897 --> 00:27:02,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually learning how to play Dota 2.

360
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:09,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And all these things that I'm sure if you're a League of Legends player sitting out there listening, you're probably going, duh, Rob.

361
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,461
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

362
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:44,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it takes you from that to, okay, now you're going to play a map and all you're going to do, you're going to take out one tower.

363
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:47,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it says, okay, now this time you're going to do a middle lane fight.

364
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:51,442
[SPEAKER_04]: The only lane that's available is the middle lane and it's a 1v1 map.

365
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:54,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just kind of learn and learn and learn that way.

366
00:27:54,904 --> 00:28:02,467
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now I'm on the part of it where I'm playing an entire match against bots, but with limited heroes selection.

367
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,108
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, I've been learning how to play the game and it's fun.

368
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,609
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still an RTS, right?

369
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:06,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

370
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:08,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what they call a MOBA.

371
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:10,873
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a new genre of game.

372
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:13,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a multiplayer online battle arena.

373
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:16,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different.

374
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:18,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really say it's like an RTS.

375
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Because RTS games just make me hurt.

376
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:26,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, imagine an RTS mixed with World of Warcraft.

377
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:29,450
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really a crude way of putting it, but it's the best I can do.

378
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:32,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I still don't know that I would like it.

379
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:34,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been thinking about it and I've seen people play it.

380
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,568
[SPEAKER_09]: But I hate real-time strategies.

381
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:37,848
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not because I'm not good at them.

382
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:38,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really good at them.

383
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:41,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think that they're very boring.

384
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:43,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would honestly recommend Dota 2.

385
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:49,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get in there and play the tutorial mode because you don't really play against other people until towards the end of it if you want.

386
00:28:49,691 --> 00:29:11,432
[SPEAKER_04]: and the nice thing about Dota 2 is if you want to play an all bot match you can but here's the interesting thing now that I've done this now I want to go back and play League of Legends again because I feel like okay now I get it and everybody tells me League of Legends is kind of easier to wrap your head around than Dota because I guess there is still a lot of stuff beyond the tutorials and Dota that I haven't really experienced yet but I want to go back and play League of Legends and you know you can do bot matches there and everything's

387
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:15,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the only negatives I ever hear about these games is the community.

388
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,935
[SPEAKER_04]: That the communities in these games are really awful.

389
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:22,457
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the makers of the games, to their credits, are taking strides to try and combat that.

390
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:29,560
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a big old blog post on the Dota 2 forums and League of Legends, I know, has their whole community tribal councils.

391
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we were calling it on Horde House and so forth.

392
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:32,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they're trying.

393
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:38,984
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, so this week I want to go back and play League of Legends and see if I get it this time.

394
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:39,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

395
00:29:41,144 --> 00:29:42,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give it a... Okay, how about this?

396
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:49,606
[SPEAKER_09]: How about at some point this week, if I'm not completely fried with my new job, I will give it a try.

397
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:50,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

398
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:52,347
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will report on it by the next show.

399
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:53,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

400
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:53,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

401
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:54,127
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

402
00:29:54,167 --> 00:30:01,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Techness in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, if you really get into Dota 2 League of Legends, you would actually find that they do play differently.

403
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:03,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't doubt that, Technus.

404
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:05,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I read some of the comparison articles online.

405
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:13,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot about the timing and things that they do play differently in that regard and just the way they're laid out and so forth.

406
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:16,209
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

407
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:21,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Technus says, I felt that League of Legends had a better hand-holding tutorial, but I haven't touched Dota 2 past beta.

408
00:30:22,294 --> 00:30:24,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that tutorial went in when it launched.

409
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:26,097
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the thing.

410
00:30:27,178 --> 00:30:32,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, Kasson in our chatroom, I hope I said that right, says, Dota has tutorials now?

411
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:32,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it does.

412
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're curious about it, why not?

413
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:35,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

414
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:40,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess that was really my gaming week in a nutshell.

415
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So some quick housekeeping.

416
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:50,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget to visit our website at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR and Facebook, Facebook.com slash OrangeLaunchRadio.

417
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:51,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

418
00:30:51,634 --> 00:31:00,039
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no Fugle Question of the Week this week, so we won't be able to do that segment in Part B. That is my bad and just the insanity crazy weekend I had.

419
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:03,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally threw this show together about an hour before we went live tonight.

420
00:31:03,981 --> 00:31:05,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we cut some quarters.

421
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:06,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I just thought of a question.

422
00:31:07,103 --> 00:31:07,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you?

423
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:07,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

424
00:31:08,264 --> 00:31:10,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we can ask it in two weeks when we come back.

425
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:12,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it won't be relevant then, but it's okay.

426
00:31:12,568 --> 00:31:12,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't.

427
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:14,470
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you going to ask?

428
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll bring it up with my story.

429
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:15,892
[SPEAKER_09]: How about that?

430
00:31:16,112 --> 00:31:16,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there you go.

431
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:17,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say ask the chatters.

432
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:19,575
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get some immediate feedback there.

433
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll ask the chatters and then we'll, yeah.

434
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:23,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there you go.

435
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:24,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some emails.

436
00:31:24,164 --> 00:31:27,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Alright, let's get into the news tonight.

437
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:27,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

438
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:44,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, as the next continuing chapter of the 180 saga, Microsoft has now confirmed that despite what they said earlier, they made a small error and yes, there will actually be self-publishing now for the Xbox One.

439
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:45,679
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

440
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,421
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Loki,

441
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

442
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:26,493
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

443
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:47,207
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know all the details yet of what the self-publishing is going to require.

444
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:48,448
[SPEAKER_11]: What you can do.

445
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:54,010
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds cool that we can use any of the retail consoles as a dev unit.

446
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,391
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's kind of cool.

447
00:32:56,051 --> 00:33:02,173
[SPEAKER_11]: But we don't know yet what the requirements are going to be as far as submitting something in there.

448
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:03,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you going to have to go through a review process?

449
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:05,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be like XNA was?

450
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:09,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you mean by cover ground, cover their ass?

451
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:31,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, yeah, to help make up ground for that they lost.

452
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:47,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then also there's a rumor that this might not just pertain to the Xbox One, that, uh, apparently the, um, developer Farsight Studios, um, who's, you know, done some work on the Pinball Arcade, uh,

453
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:48,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

454
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:11,607
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it sounds like that this may also apply to the Xbox 360 as well.

455
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:18,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, technically you have to file that in the rumor bin, but when it's coming out like this, it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, oh, they probably got told something.

456
00:34:18,252 --> 00:34:22,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that game was a pretty big deal, and it sucks that it disappeared.

457
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:24,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's no wonder.

458
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet Microsoft themselves kind of wants to get that game back.

459
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:35,243
[SPEAKER_11]: So, this is interesting with how they're going to do this, but at the same time, I mean, I don't know, this is almost like...

460
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:41,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now that this isn't really exclusive to the Xbox One, you're kind of competing with yourself again.

461
00:34:41,892 --> 00:34:44,513
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like all these great games are coming out on the Xbox 360.

462
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:49,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do I need to spend $500 to get an Xbox One that has pretty much the same games?

463
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:50,636
[SPEAKER_11]: They look slightly better.

464
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:52,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

465
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:38,411
[SPEAKER_11]: they have a 4 gig system with Kinect a 250 gig system they got rid of the 250 gig system with Kinect because that was competing with the Xbox One they figured that the people that are going to be buying that are going to be buying the Xbox One so then you have the Xbox One and then whatever holiday bundle it is that's their strategy going in and I think that's going to be going forward is how they're going to do it they're going to have 4 or 5 SKUs depending on whether there's a holiday bundle available or a bundle of some sort

466
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:43,752
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, just seems very vague.

467
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I expect this won't be ready day one.

468
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:50,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a lot of this they're just trying to save because they're talking at Gamescom.

469
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:53,014
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't want to just like, yeah, you guys already heard all this information.

470
00:35:53,054 --> 00:35:54,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's just repeat it again.

471
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:57,915
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's kind of lame that they're doing that.

472
00:35:57,935 --> 00:36:00,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because, you know, people want to know.

473
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:05,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Developers want to know what the details are so they can consider making their games for your platform.

474
00:36:05,377 --> 00:36:06,137
[SPEAKER_11]: And yet you're just like,

475
00:36:06,877 --> 00:36:10,061
[SPEAKER_11]: AkumaJP in our chatroom says, Sounds like Microsoft is suffering from multiple personality disorder.

476
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:34,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, they did take a beating at E3, and they went through a major management change just in the past month.

477
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:39,290
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fact that some of these things are starting to come out isn't that surprising.

478
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, how fast can it really happen?

479
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:43,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's all good news.

480
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's good news at the end of the day.

481
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:56,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it's going to work as far as like, are we going to see the Xbox Live Arcade marketplace turn into kind of like what Xbox Indie Games is?

482
00:36:56,928 --> 00:37:02,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope not, because that's going to be really difficult to find stuff with everybody publishing titles.

483
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:06,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially since one of the big words they used was deliverability.

484
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:10,159
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they have to make it easy to access to make it deliverable.

485
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:14,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of it too is it would really help them out.

486
00:37:14,426 --> 00:37:19,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think it's going to look more like iTunes because iTunes is the self-publishing central.

487
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:21,493
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you what this really is.

488
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:25,858
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not about publishing on the Xbox One stuff, although that's good and everything.

489
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:27,179
[SPEAKER_11]: What it is is it's...

490
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,603
[SPEAKER_11]: The way they have it, the way you develop games, it's not even really the Xbox marketplace or whatever.

491
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:39,785
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Windows Store is basically what it is.

492
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:49,389
[SPEAKER_11]: When you publish a game, it's available for Windows 8, Windows Phone, and now the Microsoft Xbox One.

493
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,250
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it's going to be, is publishing on all three platforms.

494
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,711
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trying to get to a point where...

495
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:58,114
[SPEAKER_11]: You buy Angry Birds on Windows 8.

496
00:37:59,294 --> 00:38:02,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you have Angry Birds on your Xbox One and on your Windows phone.

497
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:04,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's exactly where my mind's going.

498
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:07,481
[SPEAKER_04]: That is key because that's how iTunes works if you think about it.

499
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:12,205
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy from your mobile device or your iPad or you can buy on your desktop.

500
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:15,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And then through the cloud, it all shows up on all your devices automatically.

501
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:18,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really think that's how the game systems ought to work.

502
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony included.

503
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo too if they could ever get there.

504
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:39,595
[SPEAKER_11]: unless you buy the better version for your iPad that takes advantage of the iPad's resolution but from what I heard from them they're a long way away from that like they may be promising something like that right now but 2015 at the earliest this is going to happen wow so it's a long way off wow

505
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:45,439
[SPEAKER_11]: We had discussions with the Microsoft reps about this kind of stuff because that was my thought and they were like, yeah, you're right.

506
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:49,382
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting.

507
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:55,346
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm kind of hesitant at the same time as like, okay, you can develop games for Xbox One.

508
00:38:55,926 --> 00:39:10,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they really going to be Xbox One games, or are they going to be these Windows games running on that Windows OS portion of the Xbox 360 that just happened to be part of the Xbox One?

509
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:15,833
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not actually a true native Xbox One game, you know what I mean?

510
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:18,372
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

511
00:39:18,452 --> 00:39:25,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's going to be interesting to see what develops and also kind of how the Microsoft Sony dance continues with this.

512
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:36,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, obviously Microsoft's doing this in some way to catch up to Sony and their reaction they got at E3, but it'll be interesting to see what Sony might do to kind of one-up that.

513
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:46,397
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, let's talk about a big budget game and a game that a lot of folks are excited about over on Nintendo's platform, Smash Bros., Super Smash Bros.

514
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:56,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a new story came out this week that Masahiro Sakurai said that in the story mode, there will not be a subspace emissary storyline that was in Brawl.

515
00:39:56,864 --> 00:39:58,966
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a single-player campaign, however.

516
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:06,831
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Famitsu Magazine, he actually said that the story mode won't happen because cutscenes get uploaded on the internet.

517
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:27,270
[SPEAKER_04]: really weird excuse but here's the quote for us to ponder quote unfortunately the movie scenes we worked hard to create were uploaded onto the internet you can only truly wow a player the first time he sees a cutscene I felt if players saw the cutscenes outside of the game they would no longer service rewards for playing the game so I've decided against having them

518
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:30,112
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a very strange quote.

519
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:32,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's chew on that for a minute.

520
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:34,954
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a quote from somebody who doesn't understand how the internet works.

521
00:40:35,014 --> 00:40:35,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

522
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:42,437
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's basically... I understand his point of view where, you know, woo, that's a really cool video and stuff, but...

523
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:51,528
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like saying, if you see a movie trailer, you're not going to want to see the movie because you saw scenes from the movie in the movie trailer.

524
00:40:52,528 --> 00:40:58,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but with all the Let's Play and all of that, you can see a heck of a lot more than a trailer of a game that's out there.

525
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:04,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, but not... And Nintendo's also taken a stance against Let's Play in the past, even though they might have went back on it.

526
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:12,957
[SPEAKER_11]: But people that are watching Let's Play videos aren't necessarily going to be the people that are going to be spoiled by, Oh, I can't play this game anymore because I watched it being played through already.

527
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:14,359
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not gonna be like that.

528
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:18,005
[SPEAKER_11]: If anything, it's gonna get people excited because they see these awesome cutscenes.

529
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:20,870
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, whoa, I wanna see more of this game.

530
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:28,545
[SPEAKER_11]: But just instead of making excuses about YouTube and saying that's why you did it, just be honest.

531
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,206
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to get this game out right away.

532
00:41:30,246 --> 00:41:38,271
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a feature that not a lot of people utilize, so we're going to focus on the multiplayer and make that the best part of the game because that's what people want to play when they play Smash.

533
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:43,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Just come out and say that instead of being a dick about it and saying, hey...

534
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:48,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's because those people upload our videos on YouTube.

535
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:49,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, it's just ridiculous.

536
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with you there a little bit.

537
00:41:51,661 --> 00:41:52,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really with you there a little bit.

538
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:56,584
[SPEAKER_04]: This does seem like a convenient excuse to get the game moving right along, which is fine.

539
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,205
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, exactly the way you said it.

540
00:41:58,245 --> 00:42:01,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if he came out and said it that way, a lot of people would be like, yay!

541
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:03,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, if something we tried...

542
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:08,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Brawl, some people liked it, not a lot of people really played it.

543
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:18,642
[SPEAKER_11]: So instead of splitting our team down the middle and focusing it all on half on the single player and half on the multiplayer, we're just going to focus on the multiplayer.

544
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:20,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, that's what they did for Titanfall.

545
00:42:21,464 --> 00:42:27,910
[SPEAKER_11]: And I still don't buy that excuse, by the way, for Titanfall either, because honestly, I do care about a single player campaign for Titanfall.

546
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:48,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that the game really kicks butt, but if the fighting element of the game is really, really good, then I think people will forget about this in six months.

547
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:50,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But there could have been a better way to deliver this news.

548
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:52,548
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

549
00:42:53,295 --> 00:42:57,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of other bad news, or don't care about this news, who knows.

550
00:42:57,879 --> 00:43:01,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've heard from people that there's various minds going on about this.

551
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:07,266
[SPEAKER_09]: But Polytron put out an announcement that Fez 2 was cancelled, and Phil Fish says, yep, I'm done.

552
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:14,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is going after some internet dramas of various...

553
00:43:16,953 --> 00:43:17,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Bitch Levels.

554
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:19,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just gonna go out and say it.

555
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:22,923
[SPEAKER_09]: It's people being bitchy on the internet and people out bitching the other and out trolling the other.

556
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:24,265
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually...

557
00:43:25,382 --> 00:43:26,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to Bobby's show.

558
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:29,785
[SPEAKER_09]: He went off on it in a way that I 100% agree with.

559
00:43:31,387 --> 00:43:32,167
[SPEAKER_11]: It was ridiculous.

560
00:43:33,628 --> 00:43:34,649
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a big surprise.

561
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:42,315
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that he would do because one of the things he was arguing about with the Annoyed Gamer thing was, what kind of art have you put out?

562
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:45,717
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like your stupid show or whatever is nothing.

563
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:48,119
[SPEAKER_11]: I've created art with Fez.

564
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,281
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, dude, you've put out one indie game.

565
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:53,667
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not fucking God, okay?

566
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:55,129
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, it's a game.

567
00:43:55,429 --> 00:43:56,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was great.

568
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,111
[SPEAKER_11]: People liked it.

569
00:43:57,392 --> 00:43:57,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

570
00:43:58,413 --> 00:44:00,716
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're not like, just get off your high horse.

571
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:02,979
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one damn game, man.

572
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,060
[SPEAKER_11]: One game.

573
00:44:05,462 --> 00:44:07,144
[SPEAKER_09]: This to me looks like an internet meltdown.

574
00:44:08,195 --> 00:44:09,056
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

575
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:45,971
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a movie, and reality shows distort people all the time, you always take that stuff with a grain of salt But this really just seems like a big pomp and circumstance about something that doesn't, this whole thing is like a waste of time And in the end Oh sorry, my favorite comparison I heard out there on the internet was that Phil Fish is the Amanda Bynes of gaming Okay

576
00:44:47,854 --> 00:45:12,854
[SPEAKER_09]: My whole thing with it is that if you find yourself close to a meltdown and this is what you need to do is take a step back, go someplace safe where you have nothing to trigger you, watch some cartoons, sit back and watch some Adventure Time, open a couple beers, and play on Tumblr for a while because Tumblr is sort of safe too.

577
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,213
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it happens to the best of us.

578
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a diva fit here on OLR one night.

579
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:19,615
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an infamous moment that happened.

580
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:21,056
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like five years ago at this point.

581
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,377
[SPEAKER_09]: You scared the shit out of Shermie.

582
00:45:23,658 --> 00:45:23,998
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

583
00:45:24,038 --> 00:45:24,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't at your place.

584
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:25,619
[SPEAKER_04]: That was at the studio.

585
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:27,180
[SPEAKER_09]: You had one at my house.

586
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have had a little one, but I had a big one when something like the wrong thing was said in the chat room.

587
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:35,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, I left and I'm like, you know what?

588
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:36,905
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like... I left.

589
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:37,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I just...

590
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:39,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit mid-show.

591
00:45:39,347 --> 00:45:41,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't quit the show, but I just said, you know what?

592
00:45:41,308 --> 00:45:44,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go do something more fun than this right now because I'm not taking this right now.

593
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:44,811
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.

594
00:45:45,945 --> 00:45:46,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not making Fez 2.

595
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:23,269
[SPEAKER_04]: But I kind of sit here and go, you're going to take what this guy who calls himself an annoyed gamer says to get under your skin?

596
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:34,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and again, I don't know this other guy either, this annoyed gamer or whatever, but I kind of look at that name going, wow, you sound like everything that I hate about the games industry, all in two little words right there.

597
00:46:34,316 --> 00:46:35,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, I am the annoyed gamer.

598
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:37,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you just call yourself cynical fuck?

599
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:38,859
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm just kind of like...

600
00:46:40,233 --> 00:47:09,237
[SPEAKER_04]: the angry video game nerd did it better and that was parody yeah and he's actually hilarious and I think this other guy is kind of trying to be legit but it does seem weird to me again if the whole thing boils down to that you know Phil Fish did not want to comment on this you know Xbox thing that's going on he should have just said no comment or no thank you as opposed to fuck you you fucking fuck which is you know not a direct quote but the sense of what I get happened in that particular case

601
00:47:09,517 --> 00:47:10,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I paraphrasing a little bit.

602
00:47:11,939 --> 00:47:29,670
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like I said, he needs to take a step back, go to a safe place, maybe put on some old school Duran Duran, bop out a little bit to Hungry Like the Wolf, and then maybe come back with a cooler head.

603
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:34,051
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and I'm checking the chat room.

604
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:38,255
[SPEAKER_04]: ZZZ in our chat room says, Was the episode where Rob Rage quitted the show ever uploaded?

605
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:40,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I only listened to the podcast at the time and didn't get to hear it.

606
00:47:41,017 --> 00:47:50,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the whole thing happened over a video card error that happened because that's why the listeners pulled together and bought this new computer that we broadcast the show from.

607
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:52,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And that happened after the D.Va moment.

608
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:53,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think...

609
00:47:54,270 --> 00:48:22,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the video card like went out mid show and I actually lost the show up to that point and then when we recorded again it was that comment was said and I think the show got thrown out I don't think it was ever podcast to be honest I think it was captured on because at the time we were streaming on Justin TV this is before Twitch existed I think some of it lived on there but I think it's gone long gone as too old at this point so unless we had our bootlegger you really don't need to see it

610
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:28,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't try to capture one of my worst moments in radio.

611
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:29,937
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the downside to it.

612
00:48:30,017 --> 00:48:36,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to think I've done about... It says it was on the feed and actually it isn't.

613
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,800
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember.

614
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:38,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't either.

615
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:40,522
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

616
00:48:41,442 --> 00:48:46,224
[SPEAKER_04]: One bad moment out of 514 episodes.

617
00:48:46,244 --> 00:48:48,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you want to fixate on that one bad moment?

618
00:48:48,065 --> 00:48:49,686
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

619
00:48:50,486 --> 00:48:51,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what people do.

620
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:52,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

621
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:59,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe Lindsay Lohan was once a great actress, but people remember all the bad shit she's done.

622
00:49:00,092 --> 00:49:01,993
[SPEAKER_04]: What about all the good things Lindsay did?

623
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:04,675
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just people are focusing... Like going to rehab.

624
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:09,898
[SPEAKER_11]: People are just focusing on everything because it's just a slow news week, honestly.

625
00:49:10,178 --> 00:49:14,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I couldn't believe how many people were like running, how many different outlets were running that story.

626
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:16,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just like, are you kidding me?

627
00:49:16,422 --> 00:49:16,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

628
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:18,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't the whole thing that Bill...

629
00:49:19,284 --> 00:49:32,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Phil Fish blew up at... Didn't the whole thing boil down to the fact that this media guy felt like he deserved a comment on the situation, was calling out him and Jonathan Blow because they wouldn't comment on the Xbox situation?

630
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:33,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

631
00:49:33,536 --> 00:49:34,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that what it boiled down to?

632
00:49:34,657 --> 00:49:35,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

633
00:49:35,298 --> 00:49:37,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like... They tried to provoke a reaction.

634
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:37,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they got one.

635
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:43,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I was at a three-year-old's birthday party, and I look on the internet, because I check Twitter just every now and then.

636
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:47,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I should make him a rainbow penis cozy.

637
00:49:47,608 --> 00:49:55,154
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, annoyed gamer or whatever, welcome to my world, where we just get ignored.

638
00:49:55,735 --> 00:49:56,896
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you prefer that?

639
00:49:58,132 --> 00:50:01,675
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I mean, I get ignored by all the different media outlets.

640
00:50:01,735 --> 00:50:02,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly!

641
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:05,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like... Except occasionally Namco.

642
00:50:05,597 --> 00:50:07,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be lucky you get any comments at all.

643
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:08,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

644
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are you?

645
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:14,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm the annoyed gamer, okay?

646
00:50:15,904 --> 00:50:17,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm annoyed and I'm a gamer.

647
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:23,551
[SPEAKER_04]: You are kind of the OG annoyed gamer guy.

648
00:50:24,171 --> 00:50:29,175
[SPEAKER_04]: When we talk about Saints Row 4 or Grand Theft Auto, you suddenly become the he-he-he gamer.

649
00:50:29,275 --> 00:50:32,038
[SPEAKER_04]: You're more the tickled gamer when it comes to those games.

650
00:50:32,578 --> 00:50:33,759
[SPEAKER_09]: How about the bipolar gamer?

651
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:37,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm a little annoyed that I'm not playing Saints Row 4 right now.

652
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:38,863
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a little annoying, isn't it?

653
00:50:40,665 --> 00:50:41,365
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that make me?

654
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,286
[SPEAKER_09]: The crafty gamer?

655
00:50:45,602 --> 00:50:46,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

656
00:50:46,082 --> 00:50:46,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Penis cozy?

657
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:48,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're the rainbow penis cozy gamer.

658
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:50,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should send him one.

659
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:51,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that would make him feel better.

660
00:50:52,128 --> 00:50:52,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

661
00:50:52,568 --> 00:50:53,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

662
00:50:53,429 --> 00:50:54,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, real quick.

663
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:55,831
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 100% cotton.

664
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Feel it.

665
00:50:56,752 --> 00:50:57,393
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too hot.

666
00:50:57,713 --> 00:50:58,394
[SPEAKER_11]: I can already tell.

667
00:50:59,535 --> 00:51:00,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

668
00:51:00,596 --> 00:51:01,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on with more news.

669
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:15,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so, you know, to kind of keep along the theme of Microsoft fixing some of their hiccups in their, I don't know, game development process.

670
00:51:16,315 --> 00:51:17,797
[SPEAKER_11]: They're working World of Tanks.

671
00:51:17,957 --> 00:51:24,223
[SPEAKER_11]: The developer is basically saying, you know, they're working with Microsoft to help streamline the process of certification.

672
00:51:24,243 --> 00:51:29,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Because certification takes quite a long time with Microsoft.

673
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:56,740
[SPEAKER_11]: and because games like free to play World of Tanks need some frequent updates to be able to push that through Microsoft it's very difficult to get one of those games to work on the Xbox 360 so right now they're working out what they need to fix on Microsoft's end to help alleviate some of that problem with the certification process

674
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:00,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully it'll get better.

675
00:52:00,105 --> 00:52:18,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully this, by the time we get to November or whatever, I'm assuming it's November when this console is going to launch, that all this stuff will be ironed out and everything with self-publishing and all that stuff, it'll be a lot easier to get your game on there and keep it updated.

676
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:30,210
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like a lot of this crap that Microsoft's had to go through is really going to make them a better company when it comes to gaming with all these things that they've had to kind of change, one of them being the certification process.

677
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:44,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I wonder, like, I mean, I don't know if it's just a coincidence in timing or whatever, but, you know, the departure, you know, Don Matrick there, if he was holding all this stuff back, I mean, it's like, hey, we're fixing a lot of problems, but I think it's just coincidence, you know.

678
00:52:44,235 --> 00:52:52,260
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the next thing they need to fix, and maybe this is a little bit pie-in-the-sky dreaming, but the whole, like, no cross-platform play issue.

679
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:02,005
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because they let it go by with Final Fantasy XI, but they won't do it with Final Fantasy XIV, and I'm sure there's a host of other games that would like to, maybe Defiance or things that would like to be cross-platform.

680
00:53:02,105 --> 00:53:07,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I would like the ability to be able to play my game system without Kinect being attached.

681
00:53:07,788 --> 00:53:20,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to say that you can't have Kinect features in your game, because obviously you can still program your game with Kinect features being in there, because you know every system is going to have a Kinect.

682
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:26,873
[SPEAKER_11]: But say I don't want to play with a Kinect on there, it just disables those features instead of not working.

683
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:31,835
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it is a Kinect-required game, sorry, this game requires Kinect, please plug in Kinect to play this game.

684
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:34,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is that so hard?

685
00:53:51,874 --> 00:53:54,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I told her she should watch that.

686
00:53:54,696 --> 00:53:55,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Does she like it?

687
00:53:55,657 --> 00:53:56,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, she likes it.

688
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:56,997
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the thing.

689
00:53:57,078 --> 00:54:02,661
[SPEAKER_11]: On season two, they actually had an episode where it was all of the same stuff that's going on right now.

690
00:54:02,921 --> 00:54:07,424
[SPEAKER_11]: NSA had this device to be able to spy on everybody using webcams and stuff like that.

691
00:54:07,984 --> 00:54:10,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, this is like way before all this stuff happened.

692
00:54:10,105 --> 00:54:11,585
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the whole arc of the second season.

693
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:12,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

694
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:12,665
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.

695
00:54:12,685 --> 00:54:13,306
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so hilarious.

696
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:15,226
[SPEAKER_11]: That was ironic.

697
00:54:15,246 --> 00:54:17,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Scandal's a hella good show, huh?

698
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:24,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It's total trash, but it's like one of those shows where it's like... Sometimes you want to watch a good drama show.

699
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:28,450
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why people watch Game of Thrones or Orange is the New Black or something, right?

700
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:29,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to watch Matlock for that.

701
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,891
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes you want to just watch crap.

702
00:54:33,412 --> 00:54:35,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's that bad.

703
00:54:35,474 --> 00:54:40,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's not a terrible show, but yeah, it's a little ridiculous in their plot.

704
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:42,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't watch a show I have to turn off my brain for.

705
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:48,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about, like, Loki, she's banging the President of the United States on the side.

706
00:54:48,527 --> 00:54:52,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's a little bit like trashy romance novel, you know?

707
00:54:54,193 --> 00:55:03,542
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not as... Okay, coming from the fact that this show was created by the people that did Grey's Anatomy, they've toned it way down.

708
00:55:03,582 --> 00:55:06,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they've toned it way, way down.

709
00:55:07,886 --> 00:55:09,848
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give them props for that.

710
00:55:09,868 --> 00:55:11,529
[SPEAKER_04]: That actress is so good, though.

711
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:13,431
[SPEAKER_04]: She just commands the screen.

712
00:55:13,451 --> 00:55:14,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Kerry Washington?

713
00:55:14,372 --> 00:55:14,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

714
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:15,633
[SPEAKER_04]: She just commands the screen.

715
00:55:15,673 --> 00:55:16,694
[SPEAKER_04]: She's so fun to watch.

716
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:17,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Games.

717
00:55:17,835 --> 00:55:18,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

718
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:22,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now they want to talk TV and chat because Actdeft says Orange is the New Black is awesome.

719
00:55:23,238 --> 00:55:24,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about three episodes in.

720
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:25,420
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty good.

721
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,821
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm disappointed they got rid of?

722
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:28,442
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

723
00:55:28,482 --> 00:55:32,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Because all these shows I'm catching on, you know, Netflix and stuff.

724
00:55:32,444 --> 00:55:34,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Better Off Ted was actually great.

725
00:55:34,345 --> 00:55:36,286
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't understand why that show got canceled.

726
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,067
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we watched it.

727
00:55:37,427 --> 00:55:37,987
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too bad.

728
00:55:38,027 --> 00:55:38,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

729
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:40,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... That's sad.

730
00:55:41,549 --> 00:56:05,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadownextchat in our chat says everyone at OLR should check out the show Suits on USA Network the show is really well written and the cast plays off each other really well I have not seen that but the show on USA that everybody tells me I need to watch is Psych because that's the one that does all the tribute shows like they did the Twin Peaks episode and the Clue episode and they do all yeah that's the one I need to see there's only one show going to be coming out that I care about I don't even know the name of it but Seth Green's in it

731
00:56:06,703 --> 00:56:09,284
[SPEAKER_11]: I am going to bring this back to games real quick here.

732
00:56:09,304 --> 00:56:10,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, probably a good idea.

733
00:56:10,645 --> 00:56:15,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I did see an advertisement today on Nickelodeon because my son was watching Spongebob.

734
00:56:16,009 --> 00:56:20,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Next Saturday, they're going to be launching the show for The Rabbids, the animated series.

735
00:56:20,312 --> 00:56:22,053
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that'll be coming next Saturday.

736
00:56:22,273 --> 00:56:23,354
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if you're interested, check out.

737
00:56:23,374 --> 00:56:25,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you let your son watch Spongebob?

738
00:56:25,455 --> 00:56:26,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Only at my mom's house.

739
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:27,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

740
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's move on.

741
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:32,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of kids, let's talk Nintendo.

742
00:56:34,784 --> 00:56:36,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, bad transition, bad transition.

743
00:56:36,506 --> 00:56:42,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, look, I honestly file this a little more in fan wank and people dreaming of what could happen.

744
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:49,697
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a huge leap of faith, but I will bring it up anyway since we're about discussing the news, not necessarily reporting it.

745
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:54,582
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently we heard about the problems that Atlas' parent company was having, right?

746
00:56:54,942 --> 00:57:04,832
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's this rumor out there that because there's going to be some subsidiary auctions going on on July 28th, Atlas is one of those subsidiaries up for sale.

747
00:57:05,372 --> 00:57:12,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo could be a key player in that because apparently there's already some financial liability in that whole situation.

748
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:29,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So could Nintendo end up buying Atlas, which would mean that's a development company for them that could end up meaning Persona ends up being a Wii U exclusive, Shin Megami Tensei ends up being a Wii and 3DS, Wii U exclusive and 3DS and so on.

749
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,241
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

750
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:55,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

751
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:41,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Romance of the Three Kingdoms cross Pokemon game or something like that I think that's what it was and so they have that come out last year so because yeah they're working with them on that I don't think that's necessarily a reason and just because they publish a lot of those games on 3DS and stuff I don't think that's necessarily a reason that they're gonna purchase that company

752
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:49,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I think it's just going to get purchased by somebody else and it'll just continue kind of the way Atlas is going.

753
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:57,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe Marvelous USA or something like that will purchase Index Media because that's kind of all the wheelhouse there.

754
00:58:58,428 --> 00:58:59,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the weird thing, though.

755
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:03,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Today is July 28th, so it should be July 29th over in Japan.

756
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:07,175
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't really heard what's come of this yet.

757
00:59:08,656 --> 00:59:09,477
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also morning.

758
00:59:10,057 --> 00:59:10,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

759
00:59:10,939 --> 00:59:18,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, that was supposed to happen on July 28th, so I'm not sure why we haven't seen a five-minute look at the news to see if anything's come out of it.

760
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,117
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see Nintendo purchasing anybody, because...

761
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:21,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

762
00:59:41,484 --> 00:59:42,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

763
00:59:56,437 --> 01:00:25,308
[SPEAKER_04]: but the vast majority is on the 3DS still for it to be exclusive especially Persona that's a huge one right there if that series takes a leap over to Nintendo exclusive that's a big thing I am kind of of the mindset that I think most people that play Persona and again I am totally generalizing here and might be wrong fine I think most people that play Persona are the type that probably collect a lot of video game systems anyway and already have a Wii U

764
01:00:26,008 --> 01:00:30,931
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am kind of making a big assumption.

765
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:32,452
[SPEAKER_09]: How about the reverse?

766
01:00:32,872 --> 01:00:35,334
[SPEAKER_09]: We collect a lot of systems and I haven't played a single Persona game.

767
01:00:37,035 --> 01:00:37,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe now you'll have a reason to.

768
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

769
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:41,517
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because I don't have a Wii U. Not yet.

770
01:00:42,058 --> 01:00:42,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably won't get one.

771
01:00:43,877 --> 01:00:44,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Not ever?

772
01:00:44,898 --> 01:00:46,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 won't sway you?

773
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:48,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I was never a big Mario Kart fan.

774
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:50,560
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mario game at the end of the year won't sway you?

775
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,281
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be something.

776
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:53,001
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would not be surprised.

777
01:00:53,061 --> 01:00:55,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Shin Megami Tensei characters in the next Smash Bros.

778
01:00:55,703 --> 01:00:57,103
[SPEAKER_11]: game would not be surprised.

779
01:00:58,244 --> 01:00:59,584
[SPEAKER_09]: We just haven't been really excited.

780
01:00:59,604 --> 01:01:02,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if something, like, I didn't get a 3DS until Animal Crossing came out.

781
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And what have I been playing a crap load of?

782
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:06,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Animal Crossing?

783
01:01:06,488 --> 01:01:08,068
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be that one game that gets you over it.

784
01:01:08,088 --> 01:01:08,629
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be.

785
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:11,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Animal Crossing Wii U, it'll happen eventually.

786
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:35,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having more fun playing it portable but I mean but I mean I'm honestly I'm not really too excited about anything Nintendo's doing yet so alright ZZZ in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says if Nintendo bought Atlus I would put an evoker to my head IRL now now now no need for that no need for that let's not go to extremes here

787
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:42,424
[SPEAKER_04]: to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.

788
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:44,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the passphrase, city.

789
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:48,148
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

790
01:01:48,382 --> 01:01:53,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a whole crapload of indie developers are coming together to be a super group.

791
01:01:53,606 --> 01:01:54,006
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

792
01:01:54,606 --> 01:01:55,407
[SPEAKER_09]: They're making a game.

793
01:01:56,247 --> 01:01:58,669
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Experiment 12.

794
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:03,372
[SPEAKER_09]: And so these are 12 different developers included.

795
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:07,655
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Terry Kavanaugh who did VVVVVV in Super Hexagon.

796
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:15,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Ian Snyder, Jack Kingspooner, Zaratustra, Richard Perrin, Michael Brough.

797
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just a bunch of people on the list.

798
01:02:19,123 --> 01:02:23,166
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be kind of an interesting game associated with mental illness.

799
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:25,127
[SPEAKER_09]: But who knows what's going to happen.

800
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:27,649
[SPEAKER_09]: We've only got a few screen caps out so far.

801
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,093
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so far only on PC, but they're considering a Mac version.

802
01:02:33,774 --> 01:02:35,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So, interesting.

803
01:02:37,116 --> 01:02:39,358
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's a super group along the lines of Damn Yankees.

804
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,581
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they're going to get Ted Nugent to come out and play guitar.

805
01:02:43,601 --> 01:02:43,682
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

806
01:02:46,618 --> 01:02:49,599
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the weirdest comparison you've ever made on this program.

807
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:50,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

808
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I look forward to seeing what these guys come up with.

809
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:54,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Ted Nugent, man?

810
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:54,681
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

811
01:02:55,281 --> 01:02:56,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about crazy.

812
01:02:56,662 --> 01:03:02,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and games that will be coming a little bit sooner than this experiment.

813
01:03:02,871 --> 01:03:05,433
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not a whole ton of stuff coming out this week.

814
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:16,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much, we've got the collector's edition of Terraria coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

815
01:03:16,823 --> 01:03:17,604
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of a big deal.

816
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:24,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's just the game with, like, they have a pick-shaped USB drive and there's some vellum stickers and stuff.

817
01:03:24,674 --> 01:03:28,716
[SPEAKER_11]: The actual PlayStation 3 version is on, it's a card to download the game.

818
01:03:29,157 --> 01:03:31,378
[SPEAKER_11]: The 361, though, they put on discs like Minecraft, so that's kind of cool.

819
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:32,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

820
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:35,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Rise of the Triad this week on PC.

821
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:36,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually looking forward to that.

822
01:03:37,162 --> 01:03:38,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that like the remake?

823
01:03:38,563 --> 01:03:39,724
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the remake, yeah.

824
01:03:39,744 --> 01:03:41,526
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be coming out, so that'll be pretty sweet.

825
01:03:44,348 --> 01:03:49,772
[SPEAKER_11]: On PlayStation 3, a game which I noticed you still haven't reviewed or probably played yet, Arcania.

826
01:03:50,033 --> 01:03:52,094
[SPEAKER_11]: The Complete Tale is coming out this week on PlayStation 3.

827
01:03:52,134 --> 01:03:53,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've got to get my review done this week, so...

828
01:03:54,577 --> 01:04:09,657
[SPEAKER_04]: uh so that's coming out and then um I think honestly that's it and I will have you know I have opened that case all right I am just saying yeah all right no I look forward for that on vognetwork.com soon

829
01:04:11,238 --> 01:04:14,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.

830
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,564
[SPEAKER_04]: August 1st on the PlayStation 3, we'll see the release of Killer is Dead, the Premium Edition.

831
01:04:21,265 --> 01:04:25,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Metro Last Like, it's a Japanese release, this week as well on August 1st.

832
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:33,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sangoku Hime 2, Oki Haukou Kakosei Meshidaiga in Limited and Regular Editions comes out this week.

833
01:04:34,433 --> 01:04:35,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just checking out what kind of game that is.

834
01:04:35,994 --> 01:04:39,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it's a strategy game featuring cute little anime girls.

835
01:04:41,058 --> 01:04:59,899
[SPEAKER_04]: and moving on to the Xbox 360 to see if we have anything there in Japan this week we have Killer is Dead and Metro Last Light both over there as well checking out some of the other consoles like PlayStation Vita PlayStation Vita has Mind Zero out this week on the Vita

836
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:00,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppies!

837
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was a game about puppies.

838
01:05:21,428 --> 01:05:24,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I gotta say, the Wii U list looks really bare for August.

839
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:29,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some games aren't dated yet, but the only other game for August, Wonderful 101.

840
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:31,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

841
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:34,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that does it for Japanese releases.

842
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's check out the UK.

843
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:37,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Only a bare few.

844
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:40,702
[SPEAKER_09]: On... What's today again?

845
01:05:41,523 --> 01:05:41,903
[SPEAKER_11]: 28th.

846
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:49,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, on the 20... Actually, only on the 31st we have PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate HD and I didn't see anything for the beginning of August, so...

847
01:05:52,020 --> 01:06:17,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot to mention since it is kind of next Sunday on the 4th I believe Pikmin 3 is coming out so that will be something yes there's that whole early release though yeah keep in mind Shadow Next Gen those were Japanese releases and I didn't see that on the list maybe that was the game that was the 8th of August so and those of you in chat that are saying Pikmin 3 is in August again those were Japanese releases I was reading

848
01:06:19,874 --> 01:06:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to a couple more stories in the classic game of the week, Loki.

849
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:33,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so, I mean, even we've kind of seen this a little bit, or this isn't shocking news, but even with just like our small group of...

850
01:06:34,715 --> 01:06:36,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching.

851
01:06:36,257 --> 01:06:37,338
[SPEAKER_11]: See you next time.

852
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:07,625
[SPEAKER_11]: and what are they doing to, I don't know, combat that?

853
01:07:08,206 --> 01:07:09,027
[SPEAKER_08]: No one likes pandas.

854
01:07:11,229 --> 01:07:11,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

855
01:07:11,809 --> 01:07:14,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, so far they're not really saying anything.

856
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:23,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Their comment is, despite the shrinking subscriber base, Activision Blizzard notes that World of Warcraft remains the number one subscription-based MMORPG.

857
01:07:25,993 --> 01:07:26,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

858
01:07:45,513 --> 01:08:03,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Warcraft is backed into a corner I think they're going to need to go free to play I don't know how long Final Fantasy 14 is going to be able to get away with a subscription model to be honest if World of Warcraft goes free to play Final Fantasy 14 Final Fantasy 14 is going to be backed into at least the buy to play like Guild Wars model it's going to have to

859
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:04,200
[SPEAKER_11]: That's acceptable.

860
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd probably play it if that was the case.

861
01:08:07,803 --> 01:08:08,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, though.

862
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:12,007
[SPEAKER_04]: They really talk about a lot of content for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn.

863
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:12,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we'll see.

864
01:08:12,648 --> 01:08:17,252
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem with Warcraft is really just in this stagnant place right now.

865
01:08:17,452 --> 01:08:19,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't know what to say.

866
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they do keep trying to put out these new patches and things.

867
01:08:23,598 --> 01:08:27,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think they're going to do a new graphical overhaul of the whole game?

868
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:45,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the two big things is coming with the next expansion at BlizzCon, and it's either going to be giant graphical overhaul to modernize the game, although I don't know if they would want to cut out all these... Part of WoW's allure is that it runs on old systems, but they do bump up the specs little by little each time.

869
01:08:45,774 --> 01:08:47,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they could just have that as an option, you know?

870
01:08:48,116 --> 01:08:49,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily... Perhaps, perhaps.

871
01:08:50,157 --> 01:09:09,527
[SPEAKER_09]: so I believe that will either come out or it's going to be free to play but Warcraft's kind of backed into a corner at this point it's going to be one or the other I've already quit ages ago because I mean I played through the Panda stuff and then it wasn't fun it just was more it was the same reason I was quitting before because I just kept getting bored

872
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:35,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I also shouldn't say it's gonna go necessarily because like you know if World of Warcraft had a hundred thousand subscribers it's still making some pretty good money I mean it wouldn't be a very pleasant place but they'd still be making money but you know Blizzard is gonna get people in in other ways Hearthstone you know is a free-to-play game that's gonna bring in some cash for them the Blizzard All-Stars thing they're working on that's gonna be a free-to-play game and

873
01:09:36,014 --> 01:09:37,516
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to bring in some cash for them.

874
01:09:37,836 --> 01:09:42,780
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know what the hell Titan's all about, but then again, that's not really going to be out at least until 2016 at this point.

875
01:09:43,001 --> 01:09:46,184
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt speculates that the graphic overhaul will be Titan.

876
01:09:48,406 --> 01:09:53,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there is some buzz that Titan is World of Warcraft 2, but I don't know how much stock I put into that.

877
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:56,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so far away that it probably doesn't even matter.

878
01:09:56,653 --> 01:10:01,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of think EverQuest 2 and EverQuest kind of showed you really shouldn't do that to your MMO.

879
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,901
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet, we have Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV.

880
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:11,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Final Fantasy XI is pretty much... It has its fans that have stuck with it this long that'll keep with it.

881
01:10:11,905 --> 01:10:12,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

882
01:10:12,365 --> 01:10:15,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hey, now that I'm working, I'm going to be playing XIV.

883
01:10:15,527 --> 01:10:17,508
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I've pretty much decided on that.

884
01:10:18,289 --> 01:10:18,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

885
01:10:18,909 --> 01:10:19,669
[SPEAKER_11]: XI needs to go free-to-play.

886
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:21,430
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

887
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:22,071
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

888
01:10:23,371 --> 01:10:25,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys before the Classic Game of the Week.

889
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:30,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's about the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3.

890
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about two years ago that Mega Man Legends 3 was cancelled.

891
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:38,504
[SPEAKER_04]: We never really got the reasons why this game was cancelled.

892
01:10:38,884 --> 01:10:50,150
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was an interesting kind of report that came out this week about Gregaman, who's with Capcom Unity, talking about a recap of things we've already expressed in one form or another.

893
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:56,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So sort of a, I don't know, maybe like a post-mortem now all this time later about why the game was cancelled.

894
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:56,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote,

895
01:10:57,114 --> 01:11:13,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that Legends 3 was essentially a 10-year late sequel to a sequel to a spinoff that had middling success even back when it was one of the only games of its kind before 3D action-adventure was an established genre, if you can even remember that far back.

896
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:16,819
[SPEAKER_04]: And consider its place within the greater Mega Man brand.

897
01:11:17,379 --> 01:11:25,663
[SPEAKER_04]: If you thought DMC was a deviation from the Devil May Cry brand, remember that MML changed virtually everything you could possibly change about Mega Man.

898
01:11:26,044 --> 01:11:31,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Even I remember scoffing at the sight of it until I got my hands on it and realized it stood on its own merits.

899
01:11:31,947 --> 01:11:36,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Then consider that the game was designed for a platform that didn't even exist yet in the wild.

900
01:11:36,889 --> 01:11:41,471
[SPEAKER_04]: All that isn't to say that MML3 was a bad project, it was just weird.

901
01:11:41,852 --> 01:11:44,593
[SPEAKER_04]: But MML has always been a passion project,

902
01:11:45,033 --> 01:11:45,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a cash cow.

903
01:11:46,394 --> 01:11:47,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence the dev room angle.

904
01:11:47,995 --> 01:11:51,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a little YouTube that showed a little bit of play from the game that's out there.

905
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:58,040
[SPEAKER_04]: They go on to talk about involvement in the community and so forth.

906
01:12:00,261 --> 01:12:02,303
[SPEAKER_11]: At the same time, though, they're taking risks.

907
01:12:02,963 --> 01:12:04,904
[SPEAKER_11]: They're putting out risks for different things.

908
01:12:05,244 --> 01:12:07,085
[SPEAKER_11]: They're rebooting Strider.

909
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:09,807
[SPEAKER_11]: They made the Bionic Commando game and stuff like that.

910
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:10,127
[SPEAKER_11]: And

911
01:12:11,602 --> 01:12:40,459
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know and saying that it's completely different than the other Mega Man games well every Mega Man series is different than the other Mega Man games okay so it wasn't a 2D platformer game so what Zelda Zelda you know the 3D Zeldas weren't 2D platformer games anymore is that you're saying that that wasn't worth you know the risk I mean or you know Wind Waker is completely different than all the other games you know yet we're getting the re-release of that because apparently it just sucked so bad that we're just gonna re-release it again right you know it's not because people liked it or anything

912
01:12:41,059 --> 01:12:41,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

913
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't this whole trial version of Mega Man Legends 3 they were going to put on the eShop for like five bucks?

914
01:12:46,304 --> 01:12:49,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't this practically done before they pulled the rug on it?

915
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:49,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much.

916
01:12:49,847 --> 01:12:53,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought the whole thing was just to gauge interest in that stuff.

917
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:54,711
[SPEAKER_11]: So release it.

918
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:56,452
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't make sense.

919
01:12:56,573 --> 01:12:56,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

920
01:12:57,765 --> 01:12:58,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it download.

921
01:12:58,485 --> 01:12:59,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Just make it download only.

922
01:12:59,806 --> 01:13:02,247
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the plan for the prototype thing they were going to do.

923
01:13:02,808 --> 01:13:06,410
[SPEAKER_04]: They were basically going to do a paid demo to see if people were interested in the game.

924
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it to some fanboys and let them finish the last steps.

925
01:13:07,911 --> 01:13:09,872
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they do now for everything on their stuff.

926
01:13:09,892 --> 01:13:16,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember all the Dead Rising Zero stuff where it's a prequel but it's really just a demo.

927
01:13:18,516 --> 01:13:19,217
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disappointing.

928
01:13:20,157 --> 01:13:33,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's travel back to a time when things were a little simpler and maybe because we didn't have the internet or anything like that, we didn't get disappointed when games suddenly got cancelled.

929
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:36,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Although they might show up in a Nintendo Power and then suddenly disappear.

930
01:13:37,494 --> 01:13:39,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in this case, a Genesis Power.

931
01:13:40,036 --> 01:13:40,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Or who knows.

932
01:13:40,877 --> 01:13:42,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a Sega Master System Power.

933
01:13:42,699 --> 01:13:44,681
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

934
01:13:45,245 --> 01:13:49,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantasy Star, Wii, which I can't believe I haven't done this one yet.

935
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:50,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe you haven't done it either.

936
01:13:50,248 --> 01:13:52,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of brought this up earlier in the show, didn't you?

937
01:13:52,069 --> 01:13:58,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I did, because Dan's playing the Sega Ages Generation 1, which is Fantasy Star.

938
01:13:58,912 --> 01:14:08,257
[SPEAKER_09]: We bought these back when the Sega Ages ones came out, except it was all in Japanese, and our friend was trying to translate while we were playing, and she's like, oh, well, this part isn't important.

939
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,658
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need to know what they said.

940
01:14:09,798 --> 01:14:11,539
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're like, okay, we'll stop playing it.

941
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, actually, someone has done an English patch.

942
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:19,842
[SPEAKER_09]: And I linked from the Generations one because the music in it was so good.

943
01:14:20,982 --> 01:14:25,563
[SPEAKER_09]: But the first fantasy star came out on the Master System.

944
01:14:26,304 --> 01:14:27,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came out in Japan on December 20th, 1987.

945
01:14:27,844 --> 01:14:30,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in North America and Europe in 1988.

946
01:14:30,485 --> 01:14:30,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

947
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:44,129
[SPEAKER_09]: It is one of the I'd say granddaddies of the RPG genre and it's also one of the first games that had a female protagonist.

948
01:14:45,896 --> 01:14:47,557
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been other versions of it.

949
01:15:04,427 --> 01:15:06,588
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty traditional for RPG format.

950
01:15:06,608 --> 01:15:08,789
[SPEAKER_09]: You go over your overworld maps, you talk to people.

951
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:17,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Your dungeons, though, are done sort of a pseudo-3D, where you're walking through, kind of first-person perspective, like it's, you know, Doom or something.

952
01:15:18,354 --> 01:15:27,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it flashes into an over-the-shoulder view when you're fighting critters and stuff.

953
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:35,245
[SPEAKER_09]: and they even have little animations which is a lot more than Final Fantasy had at that time.

954
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:41,629
[SPEAKER_09]: And you get different weapons and magic and you have really memorable characters.

955
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:48,133
[SPEAKER_09]: You had Alice, you had Meow who's like this kind of cat thing and Odin and Noah.

956
01:15:49,414 --> 01:15:51,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically those are your main characters through the whole thing.

957
01:15:51,435 --> 01:15:52,636
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got your antagonists.

958
01:15:53,536 --> 01:16:02,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, this is one of the... And especially for the Sega fans, this is the game to have.

959
01:16:03,144 --> 01:16:06,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Thankfully, we've got all the Phantasy Star games complete in their boxes.

960
01:16:07,327 --> 01:16:11,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And trust me, it's something that's just really fun to have.

961
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:17,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, like I said, it did get a re-release through the Sega Ages branding.

962
01:16:18,302 --> 01:16:22,730
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think that the Generations 1 is really good.

963
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,901
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically just touched up.

964
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:33,544
[SPEAKER_09]: It maybe looks like an early PS1 RPG, a little bit cleaner maybe.

965
01:16:34,305 --> 01:16:41,668
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, you're taking a game from the Master System and updating everything in it, so it's a very, very good translation.

966
01:16:41,688 --> 01:16:47,611
[SPEAKER_09]: The music's great, the graphics are great, they're really fun to play, and there is an English patch out right now if you've got a PS2 emulator.

967
01:16:48,411 --> 01:16:52,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I can't, you know, say, go do it, go do it, go do it, because that would be wrong.

968
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:59,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the game right now, as far as the Master System version, um...

969
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:05,115
[SPEAKER_09]: It can go for a lot.

970
01:17:05,395 --> 01:17:10,156
[SPEAKER_09]: When the game first came out, it retailed for $70 and some places sold it for $80.

971
01:17:11,317 --> 01:17:16,718
[SPEAKER_09]: And keep in mind, this was an 8-bit game, so that was a lot of money for an early game.

972
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:25,641
[SPEAKER_09]: And other ones that sold more than that were like Time Zone, but Phantasy Star was the most expensive console game ever sold at its time.

973
01:17:27,002 --> 01:17:43,901
[SPEAKER_09]: and it did get a price drop when the Master System 2 hardware came out it had sequels of course we had Phantasy Star 2, 3 and 4 if I'm right I think 3 is the one that's really hard to find of course the other ones came out on the Genesis slash Master System

974
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:54,109
[SPEAKER_09]: With the Japanese release, one really neat thing about the first one is that it did take advantage of the FM chip, the Yamaha YM-2413 chip.

975
01:17:54,829 --> 01:18:02,554
[SPEAKER_09]: So it had some really good sound, but since the North American Impala systems didn't have that chip, it doesn't sound quite as good.

976
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:05,076
[SPEAKER_09]: But on Virtual Console, you get an option of playing it with the FM soundtrack.

977
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:16,143
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is probably one of the greatest video games of all time, especially in the RPG genre.

978
01:18:17,104 --> 01:18:27,433
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's actually, as far as its popularity when it came out, it actually went sort of outside video game publications and was even mentioned in, like, Boys Life.

979
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:34,299
[SPEAKER_09]: So, which I don't even know if that magazine's out anymore, but wasn't it like one of old camping...

980
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:37,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, wasn't that the Boy Scouts magazine or something?

981
01:18:37,396 --> 01:18:38,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought so.

982
01:18:38,536 --> 01:18:39,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it was.

983
01:18:39,797 --> 01:18:42,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I used to get it when I was in Cub Scouts.

984
01:18:43,258 --> 01:18:48,920
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, seriously, if none of you have, and I'll be honest, I didn't play it when it came out.

985
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:49,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played it.

986
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:51,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it as an adult.

987
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:56,183
[SPEAKER_09]: But even me coming into it as an adult, I still enjoyed it.

988
01:18:56,983 --> 01:19:16,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's one that anyone can pick up if you love RPGs And I also, being a fan of Phantasy Star Online It's sort of neat seeing how some of the graphics in the updated version Actually correspond to some of the updates in the Phantasy Star Online series So it's pretty neat Kind of seeing where it all came from

989
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:25,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like they pulled the original concepts and then with what they're doing for Phantasy Star Online, they're sort of merging the two, sort of bringing one up to date.

990
01:19:26,415 --> 01:19:30,636
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit slightly different, but they have lots in common stylistically.

991
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:33,037
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's it.

992
01:19:33,077 --> 01:19:33,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Phantasy Star.

993
01:19:33,942 --> 01:19:37,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Phantasy Star for the Sega Master System.

994
01:19:37,865 --> 01:19:42,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, certainly the Sega Ages series on PlayStation 2 is a big part of that as well.

995
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:47,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and like I said, it has been translated however you want to play it.

996
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:50,852
[SPEAKER_04]: or watch people play it on YouTube like we've been doing here in studio.

997
01:19:51,613 --> 01:19:51,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

998
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:54,335
[SPEAKER_09]: How much Mercedes do you have on you, Rob?

999
01:19:54,975 --> 01:19:56,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, 50 bucks maybe?

1000
01:19:57,897 --> 01:20:03,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to laugh because Dan actually called me when I was in the back room last night saying, I finally got to the Rappies!

1001
01:20:03,281 --> 01:20:04,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Come look at them!

1002
01:20:04,362 --> 01:20:07,044
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I'm watching Dan kill Rappies because I hate Rappies.

1003
01:20:07,284 --> 01:20:09,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1004
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:20,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting how much of that... Playing Phantasy Star Online as much as I did, it's interesting going back to the Phantasy Star games and seeing where the Monomates and the Telepipes and all that come from.

1005
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:21,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, the Rappies too.

1006
01:20:23,334 --> 01:20:24,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to tell you a story about Julie.

1007
01:20:25,936 --> 01:20:27,416
[SPEAKER_09]: You know which Julie I'm talking about.

1008
01:20:28,317 --> 01:20:32,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Julie paid $120 to order a Rappie plushie.

1009
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,581
[SPEAKER_09]: That's as big as my upper torso.

1010
01:20:35,305 --> 01:20:36,706
[SPEAKER_04]: That's dedication.

1011
01:20:36,726 --> 01:20:38,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably almost as wide as your table.

1012
01:20:38,668 --> 01:20:39,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a gigantic Pikachu.

1013
01:20:40,849 --> 01:20:44,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, take your Pikachu and make the wrappy a little bit bigger than that.

1014
01:20:44,252 --> 01:20:44,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1015
01:20:45,253 --> 01:20:47,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And fully stuffed in, you know, with the bits and everything.

1016
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:50,277
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because she was that much into PSO at the time.

1017
01:20:50,337 --> 01:20:51,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds adorable.

1018
01:20:51,978 --> 01:20:53,519
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like a waste of money.

1019
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:55,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Judge, judge, judge.

1020
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:56,722
[SPEAKER_04]: We all do silly things.

1021
01:20:56,782 --> 01:20:57,002
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1022
01:20:57,022 --> 01:20:57,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1023
01:20:57,242 --> 01:20:57,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have just made one.

1024
01:20:58,303 --> 01:20:59,344
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a break, guys.

1025
01:20:59,364 --> 01:21:12,295

01:21:54,766 --> 01:21:59,870
[SPEAKER_04]: The episode was so long, they split it up into two parts, but I'll be on the part B, which was like almost three hours in itself.

1036
01:22:00,311 --> 01:22:03,273
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked all about music games tonight was the topic.

1037
01:22:03,694 --> 01:22:06,216
[SPEAKER_04]: So, or I should say today, music games was the topic.

1038
01:22:06,316 --> 01:22:11,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, just having done the early days of OLR, we were nothing but music game chat.

1039
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:30,543

[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get back into some rapid fire news, Loki.

1041
01:22:34,927 --> 01:22:39,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about old games.

1042
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,211
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, Star Control.

1043
01:22:42,752 --> 01:22:48,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Control was one of the franchises that was being auctioned off as part of this whole Atari...

1048
01:24:08,518 --> 01:24:10,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise.

1049
01:24:10,799 --> 01:24:13,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming these are all educational PC titles at some time.

1050
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:17,161
[SPEAKER_04]: What exactly would Fatty Bear get as a birthday surprise?

1051
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:18,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, a fatty.

1052
01:24:19,202 --> 01:24:19,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Some honey.

1053
01:24:20,703 --> 01:24:21,223
[SPEAKER_09]: A rice cake.

1054
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:23,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Fatty Bear.

1055
01:24:23,893 --> 01:24:24,834
[SPEAKER_04]: He gets cholesterol.

1056
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:27,697
[SPEAKER_04]: He gets... Oh, Loki, you could appreciate this.

1057
01:24:27,818 --> 01:24:28,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangent time.

1058
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:29,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Choo-choo.

1059
01:24:29,299 --> 01:24:29,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangent time.

1060
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:30,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1061
01:24:30,741 --> 01:24:33,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Alan and I went to the State Fair on Friday.

1062
01:24:33,945 --> 01:24:34,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1063
01:24:34,246 --> 01:24:37,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know they've got deep-fried food like crazy.

1064
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:37,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1065
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:38,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Act surprise.

1066
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:38,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Act surprise.

1067
01:24:38,892 --> 01:24:39,112
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1068
01:24:39,292 --> 01:24:41,114
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1069
01:25:07,981 --> 01:25:13,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Deep Fried Red Velvet, but we settled on Deep Fried Oreos.

1070
01:25:15,146 --> 01:25:17,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alan, do you want to talk about how they tasted?

1071
01:25:18,388 --> 01:25:22,291
[SPEAKER_05]: They were really good, but at the same time, it's almost too much.

1072
01:25:22,571 --> 01:25:29,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at that age where I'm like, okay, it's not disgusting, but I only just wanted one or two, and you made me eat three of them out of the four.

1073
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,942
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1074
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:51,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it was delicious.

1075
01:25:51,972 --> 01:25:53,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you had deep fried Oreos, Loki?

1076
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:59,355
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but I'm very disappointed that you didn't talk about the booth dedicated to bacon.

1077
01:25:59,595 --> 01:26:01,135
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a whole bacon booth.

1078
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:03,336
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't find the bacon dedicated booth.

1079
01:26:03,396 --> 01:26:08,598
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw like the chocolate covered bacon and we saw the bacon maple something something.

1080
01:26:08,618 --> 01:26:10,559
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they had a whole booth that was dedicated to bacon there.

1081
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:11,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we missed that.

1082
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:12,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go.

1083
01:26:12,841 --> 01:26:14,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see how you could have missed that.

1084
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:17,406
[SPEAKER_11]: There should have been mile-long lines going to that booth.

1085
01:26:17,526 --> 01:26:18,367
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was empty.

1086
01:26:18,407 --> 01:26:19,248
[SPEAKER_04]: We went Friday morning.

1087
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:22,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the day off work.

1088
01:26:22,452 --> 01:26:26,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Fatty Bear would want some deep-fried Oreos.

1089
01:26:27,298 --> 01:26:28,339
[SPEAKER_04]: They had deep-fried bacon there.

1090
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:37,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So fried Coke is when they take funnel cake batter and they put Coke syrup in it until it turns brown inside of Coke flavored.

1091
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:40,633
[SPEAKER_05]: They drizzle it into the hot grease so that it looks like a funnel cake.

1092
01:26:40,693 --> 01:26:42,234
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all just, you know, the little ropes of dough.

1093
01:26:42,774 --> 01:26:46,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they put that in a cup and they sprinkle powdered sugar on it.

1094
01:26:46,597 --> 01:26:48,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they put more pure Coke syrup on top of that.

1095
01:26:49,559 --> 01:26:50,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's fried Coke.

1096
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And then fried Kool-Aid is pretty much the same thing.

1097
01:26:52,241 --> 01:26:57,065
[SPEAKER_05]: They put Kool-Aid in the dough or in the batter and then they put Tarani strawberry syrup on it.

1098
01:26:59,352 --> 01:27:02,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember when we did fried Twinkies at... I do.

1099
01:27:02,894 --> 01:27:07,578
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like our sideshow at... It wasn't... It was... Shaft.

1100
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:07,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Shaft.

1101
01:27:08,378 --> 01:27:10,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

1102
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,740
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we publicly called it.

1103
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,742
[SPEAKER_04]: We were selling deep fried Twinkies for no reason.

1104
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, through half of one.

1105
01:27:15,843 --> 01:27:16,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1106
01:27:16,183 --> 01:27:17,004
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so... Anyway.

1107
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:18,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1108
01:27:18,685 --> 01:27:26,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com because we have... Ionotropic says, Loki wants deep fried gummy bears, three pound bag version.

1109
01:27:26,891 --> 01:27:27,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1110
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:31,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would you want... By the way, that took me two days to get through that.

1111
01:27:31,676 --> 01:27:34,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a tweet from you that was like, my stomach's so full.

1112
01:27:34,539 --> 01:27:36,621
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was like, why do I keep eating these things?

1113
01:27:36,641 --> 01:27:37,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're delicious.

1114
01:27:37,663 --> 01:27:39,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Still eating them as I'm posting it.

1115
01:27:39,184 --> 01:27:39,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Delicious.

1116
01:27:40,346 --> 01:27:43,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so basically... Yeah, it took me two days to get through that three pound bag.

1117
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:44,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1118
01:27:45,611 --> 01:27:47,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, actually, I wouldn't want deep fried.

1119
01:27:47,672 --> 01:27:50,772
[SPEAKER_11]: It would just dissolve into mush because it would, you know, liquefy.

1120
01:27:50,972 --> 01:27:52,533
[SPEAKER_05]: They had some weird stuff.

1121
01:27:52,593 --> 01:27:54,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this one booth had like 20 different things.

1122
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:56,554
[SPEAKER_05]: There were deep fried Pop-Tarts.

1123
01:27:57,134 --> 01:27:58,674
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, that's already bready.

1124
01:27:58,714 --> 01:28:00,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, why would you just want to put more dough on that?

1125
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:01,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Deep fried.

1126
01:28:01,895 --> 01:28:02,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they have deep fried?

1127
01:28:03,275 --> 01:28:03,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Fruity Pebbles.

1128
01:28:04,275 --> 01:28:05,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Deep fried Fruity Pebbles.

1129
01:28:05,195 --> 01:28:07,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think deep fried Cocoa Puffs and Captain Crunch.

1130
01:28:08,103 --> 01:28:09,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like different cereal.

1131
01:28:10,204 --> 01:28:11,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Fruity Pebbles might have been alright.

1132
01:28:12,385 --> 01:28:15,767
[SPEAKER_11]: See, that's something more of you bread it with that, you know?

1133
01:28:16,087 --> 01:28:18,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to tell you right now that all of that sounds really disgusting.

1134
01:28:18,248 --> 01:28:18,948
[SPEAKER_11]: What gaming thing?

1135
01:28:19,008 --> 01:28:20,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Fatty Bear.

1136
01:28:20,109 --> 01:28:20,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the one that was disgusting.

1137
01:28:21,009 --> 01:28:24,551
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember what they called it, but it was a deep fried Twinkie with some sort of cheese on it.

1138
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:28,753
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was either Cheez Whiz or some sort of nacho cheese wrapped in bacon.

1139
01:28:29,713 --> 01:28:34,876
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a Twinkie wrapped in bacon with cheese and then deep fried.

1140
01:28:35,056 --> 01:28:36,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm having a heart attack listening to you.

1141
01:28:36,957 --> 01:28:37,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

1142
01:28:38,654 --> 01:28:40,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Spray cheese is always automatically disgusting.

1143
01:28:40,935 --> 01:28:42,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry if that's true.

1144
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:44,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not anyone's lifestyle.

1145
01:28:44,796 --> 01:28:45,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy cheese is gross.

1146
01:28:45,956 --> 01:28:49,197
[SPEAKER_09]: When it says cheese food on the label, you know that's what cheese eats.

1147
01:28:49,777 --> 01:28:50,037
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1148
01:28:50,077 --> 01:28:51,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, back to video game news.

1149
01:28:51,817 --> 01:28:55,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alan, for bringing a little fatty bear to our show.

1150
01:28:56,318 --> 01:28:57,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean that in a negative way.

1151
01:28:57,979 --> 01:28:58,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you going?

1152
01:28:59,279 --> 01:28:59,499
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1153
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:01,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Loki.

1154
01:29:30,494 --> 01:29:49,651
[SPEAKER_11]: and last but not least they're already talking about the DLC plan for Saints Row 4 which doesn't sound like much as far as like content stuff the first piece of DLC is going to be the Enter the Dominatrix now you may be thinking hey wait a second didn't Enter the Dominatrix become Saints Row 4 I mean they kind of expanded upon it

1155
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:55,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's not necessarily gonna be... That's kind of all the stuff they cut out of the game.

1156
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:58,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Stuff that they couldn't really work in there.

1157
01:29:58,541 --> 01:30:04,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there's gonna be some sort of mockumentary take on all the things that they couldn't do for the game, but...

1158
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:10,734
[SPEAKER_11]: I did watch some interviews where they pulled a Bethesda where the Skyrim team had a week to develop whatever they wanted for the game

1159
01:30:21,622 --> 01:30:45,650
[SPEAKER_11]: and so Saints Row they did the same thing at Volition they had all sorts of things like a dragon that breathed fire that you would have been able to ride was one of the things that you know they were going to try to do but it just didn't work in the game um you know some of the limitations and stuff so I hope some of that stuff becomes DLC that would be pretty cool but um they do have a season pass that they announced that's only two pieces of DLC and it's ten dollars

1160
01:30:46,211 --> 01:30:55,534
[SPEAKER_11]: that once again as we were talking about before in part a that's a bundle that's not a season pass as a bundle of dlc because it's two the season pass is not two things

1161
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:59,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I'll have to buy it because it's only two.

1162
01:30:59,722 --> 01:31:04,506
[SPEAKER_09]: A season pass would be they give you these two things and then you've paid for the other stuff that comes out that season.

1163
01:31:04,546 --> 01:31:09,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have a feeling there's going to be a ton of customization DLC like they've had before.

1164
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:12,333
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all paid unlock stuff.

1165
01:31:12,513 --> 01:31:13,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure they're going to have that available.

1166
01:31:13,914 --> 01:31:16,677
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how they did Saints Row the Third.

1167
01:31:18,238 --> 01:31:18,539
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1168
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:23,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, moving on to some other stories in gaming real quick here.

1169
01:31:23,303 --> 01:31:28,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Connect Sports Rivals, that was one of those games that was announced for Xbox One at E3.

1170
01:31:29,028 --> 01:31:32,251
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been confirmed that it will miss the launch window.

1171
01:31:33,152 --> 01:31:35,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally, this game was going to come out in November.

1172
01:31:35,354 --> 01:31:42,300
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Microsoft told Polygon that there is a delay and it is necessary in order to give Rare enough time to polish it up.

1173
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:54,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Before launch So it just wasn't ready to go Spring of next year, the new time frame that's being given for that These things happen all of the time Launch games get pushed back Wasn't Pikmin 3 supposed to be a launch game for the Wii U?

1174
01:31:54,284 --> 01:31:56,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's just now coming out?

1175
01:31:56,364 --> 01:31:58,165
[SPEAKER_04]: These things happen You know what?

1176
01:31:58,325 --> 01:32:12,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Take the time to get it right Even though this game doesn't really sound like one I'm really interested in anyway It still might be interesting for other people It's one of those family games Yeah, it's a family game, kiddie game Families aren't going to be picking up Dead Rising 3 for their little kids True, very true

1177
01:32:12,609 --> 01:32:14,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you kidding?

1178
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:15,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I would totally play that when I was a kid.

1179
01:32:15,671 --> 01:32:25,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully this delay won't cause people to go over to the Wii U. Or, well, depending on how you look at it, maybe this delay will, yay, make people go over to the Wii U. However you're looking at it.

1180
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:30,122
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Wii U is looking at possibly a Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD bundle.

1181
01:32:31,002 --> 01:32:35,044
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a report from an inventory system at a major US retailer.

1182
01:32:35,064 --> 01:32:37,645
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know which one, so take this with a grain of salt.

1183
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:43,327
[SPEAKER_04]: These stories are often a little eh, unless Loki, of course, is the one reporting on it, because I trust him.

1184
01:32:43,347 --> 01:32:50,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is looking at a Wii U bundle for Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD, supposedly a 3DS handheld that comes with Pokemon X and Pokemon Y as well.

1185
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:55,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, aren't there those limited edition 3DSs with Pokemon with the art on them?

1186
01:32:55,331 --> 01:32:59,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I know those are coming out in Japan, so it would seem very logical those come out here, too.

1187
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:00,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Those might come out over here.

1188
01:33:01,032 --> 01:33:04,513
[SPEAKER_11]: We're supposed to be getting that 3DS, the black 3DS XL, next month.

1189
01:33:04,893 --> 01:33:07,654
[SPEAKER_11]: The one that was rumored to be coming out over here is actually coming over here next month.

1190
01:33:09,494 --> 01:33:20,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Surprisingly enough, actually, Zelda is coming out a lot earlier than I thought it would be, because I pegged that as a November title, but they said it was October, and it's actually the first week of October, so...

1191
01:33:20,737 --> 01:33:25,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I was going to say, October is when these games are launching, so you could bet that this bundle will come out at the same time.

1192
01:33:25,358 --> 01:33:30,399
[SPEAKER_11]: First week of October for that, and third or fourth for We Party You, which no one gives a shit about.

1193
01:33:30,979 --> 01:33:31,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you never know.

1194
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,920
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be that one fan.

1195
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:40,361
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's probably, I'm assuming then, you know, November is going to be the 3DSL, then, you know, Super Mario World 3D.

1196
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:40,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1197
01:33:42,682 --> 01:33:49,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney is looking into a new technology called Aerial Aerial is a new invention that blows air

1198
01:33:57,802 --> 01:34:00,444
[SPEAKER_04]: That's supposed to simulate a tactile experience.

1199
01:34:00,504 --> 01:34:07,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, you're supposed to be able to feel objects where there might not necessarily be one because of the way the air goes.

1200
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:15,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It was created by PhD student Rajanidhar Sodhi and a Disney researcher, Ivan Popriev.

1201
01:34:16,557 --> 01:34:19,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be placed on a TV or even on an iPad.

1202
01:34:19,879 --> 01:34:24,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can actually simulate buttons to touching in midair to making you feel like water moving.

1203
01:34:25,143 --> 01:34:51,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Stone, Sand This could actually be something really cool My mind always goes to Disney theme parks and how could that make rides feel That might be really cool I just don't understand how that would work The tech is in a very early phase so no word on where this is going They have a YouTube up if you want to see more about it There you go You alright over there?

1204
01:34:52,194 --> 01:34:55,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate Destructoid for iPad.

1205
01:34:55,716 --> 01:34:55,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Hate.

1206
01:34:56,537 --> 01:34:59,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It brings up an ad and then it shuts down my Safari.

1207
01:35:00,299 --> 01:35:01,820
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm on spite.

1208
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:02,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't want to read that story.

1209
01:35:04,641 --> 01:35:05,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one was it?

1210
01:35:06,142 --> 01:35:07,243
[SPEAKER_09]: The Zelda mod.

1211
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:09,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I can mention it real quick here.

1212
01:35:09,106 --> 01:35:10,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, please.

1213
01:35:10,446 --> 01:35:15,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jamie out of spite will not be telling you about this Legend of Zelda mod.

1214
01:35:15,848 --> 01:35:17,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a great trailer, by the way.

1215
01:35:17,589 --> 01:35:17,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it?

1216
01:35:18,169 --> 01:35:19,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a fantastic trailer.

1217
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:21,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1218
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:24,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it's this mod for Zelda.

1219
01:35:24,972 --> 01:35:26,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to figure out what Zelda game it is.

1220
01:35:26,852 --> 01:35:27,653
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not for Zelda.

1221
01:35:27,693 --> 01:35:33,035
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like all the different Zelda worlds put together.

1222
01:35:33,275 --> 01:35:36,196
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the medieval Total War.

1223
01:35:36,216 --> 01:35:36,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Total War.

1224
01:35:36,636 --> 01:35:37,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so it's the other way around.

1225
01:35:37,678 --> 01:35:40,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Zelda hack for Medieval 2.

1226
01:35:40,762 --> 01:35:42,004
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really crazy.

1227
01:35:42,044 --> 01:35:47,872
[SPEAKER_11]: The trailer, they've got giant characters and stuff.

1228
01:35:47,972 --> 01:35:49,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course there's an add-on.

1229
01:35:49,554 --> 01:35:51,717
[SPEAKER_09]: All I read was carrying around Link's dead corpse.

1230
01:35:51,877 --> 01:36:11,042
[SPEAKER_11]: but I and I do give the ad credit because I did see the same ad earlier today and I did not know Sigur Rós had a new album coming out so I yes that was it's out now actually yes that was they're going on tour again oh I really need to see them they're a great band just just but anyways yeah there's got they've got some really crazy stuff as you get into it um

1231
01:36:17,202 --> 01:36:18,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know who some of the characters were.

1232
01:36:18,964 --> 01:36:20,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, obviously I know who that is.

1233
01:36:20,626 --> 01:36:26,913
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was, like, they had some of the guy from Majora's Mask or whatever in there.

1234
01:36:26,933 --> 01:36:27,955
[SPEAKER_11]: This looks neat.

1235
01:36:28,495 --> 01:36:30,457
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks very, very epic.

1236
01:36:31,999 --> 01:36:33,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of it looks a little bad.

1237
01:36:33,481 --> 01:36:34,642
[SPEAKER_11]: A little derpy, yeah.

1238
01:36:34,983 --> 01:36:36,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Her crying looks a little bad.

1239
01:36:37,265 --> 01:36:40,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think it's supposed to be, like, some sort of... But, yeah, like, that thing looks cool.

1240
01:36:40,868 --> 01:36:47,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that is, but... It kind of makes you want to check out Medieval 2 Total War, doesn't it?

1241
01:36:47,253 --> 01:36:49,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but, like, let's see if this is the one.

1242
01:36:50,976 --> 01:36:53,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Towards the end there, they've got some really cool stuff.

1243
01:36:53,638 --> 01:36:53,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Neat.

1244
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:54,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1245
01:36:55,299 --> 01:36:56,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Jamie, there you go.

1246
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:03,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, because their page has never worked right on my iPad.

1247
01:37:03,082 --> 01:37:05,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop crashing people's iPads, fools.

1248
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:07,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Your developers seriously need to have their hands slapped.

1249
01:37:08,244 --> 01:37:08,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1250
01:37:09,124 --> 01:37:10,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Destructoid, hire better designers.

1251
01:37:11,665 --> 01:37:12,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, snap.

1252
01:37:12,225 --> 01:37:12,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Gauntlet thrown.

1253
01:37:14,186 --> 01:37:38,899
[SPEAKER_09]: um anyway uh there is a report that a Gran Turismo movie is in development um it's uh supposed to be produced by let's see Michael DeLuca and Dana Brunetti and uh they're also the people though that are working on Fifty Shades of Shit I mean Grey so I don't know how I would think about that whatever

1254
01:37:40,607 --> 01:37:50,330
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, in other news, this is, well, you know, we rag on dating games every so often, but this one is just hilarious.

1255
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:56,852
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an appearance in a dating game by Keiji Inafune.

1256
01:37:57,712 --> 01:38:00,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's, uh, basically the game is called Sweet Fuse.

1257
01:38:01,054 --> 01:38:02,675
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a dating game for the PSP.

1258
01:38:03,235 --> 01:38:06,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can seduce one of seven steamy bachelors.

1259
01:38:07,197 --> 01:38:07,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

1260
01:38:07,898 --> 01:38:12,120
[SPEAKER_09]: But, uh, Inafune is, uh, in the game and you can, uh, court him.

1261
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:13,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's right.

1262
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:14,701
[SPEAKER_11]: They have that coming out on PSP over here.

1263
01:38:15,001 --> 01:38:15,602
[SPEAKER_11]: The end of August.

1264
01:38:15,942 --> 01:38:16,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1265
01:38:17,023 --> 01:38:18,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that I know what that is, that's even creepier.

1266
01:38:19,524 --> 01:38:23,586
[SPEAKER_09]: His, uh, portrait here looks creepy.

1267
01:38:24,907 --> 01:38:26,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's listed as legendary creator.

1268
01:38:28,385 --> 01:38:31,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to some more news in the meantime

1269
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:52,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so sales haven't been that great.

1270
01:38:53,027 --> 01:39:05,433
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an article that was on Gamasutra, and they were talking, or I should say polling some of the developers that have games on there, and they were talking about some of the attach rates and stuff and how not good they are.

1271
01:39:05,953 --> 01:39:14,238
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, one of the games, I guess, Hidden in Plain Sight, it's brought in $4,381 on 1,900 purchases, and that was basically sold at a pay-what-you-want price, so

1272
01:39:19,488 --> 01:39:19,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Minimum $1

1273
01:39:21,628 --> 01:39:31,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, there was another game, Get On Top, that's earned $728 off of 9,700 downloads and 520 purchases off that.

1274
01:39:32,772 --> 01:39:46,256
[SPEAKER_11]: They were saying some of them, like Bomb Squad, which is one of the more popular games, peaked, I guess, 200 sales per day, and now it's sort of around 70 per day, which is a $5 game.

1275
01:39:46,316 --> 01:39:46,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1276
01:39:50,017 --> 01:39:56,440
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a really indie guy who created a game called Bomb Ball who's made a little over $30 a day.

1277
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,621
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not terrible.

1278
01:39:58,901 --> 01:40:03,042
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, for an indie, maybe that's not terrible.

1279
01:40:04,183 --> 01:40:10,005
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Tower Fall, which is probably one of the most notable games on the OUYA right now.

1280
01:40:10,366 --> 01:40:12,687
[SPEAKER_11]: He said they've reached about 2,000 sales so far at $15 each.

1281
01:40:12,727 --> 01:40:12,827
[SPEAKER_11]: So, $30,000?

1282
01:40:12,887 --> 01:40:13,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1283
01:40:21,227 --> 01:40:31,837
[SPEAKER_11]: But basically, overall, the stats have shown that I want to say that only about 27% of people that have an Ouya have actually bought games for it.

1284
01:40:33,038 --> 01:40:34,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas everyone else is just playing kind of free stuff.

1285
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say it was 27%.

1286
01:40:36,202 --> 01:40:39,165
[SPEAKER_11]: It was some ridiculously high number of people.

1287
01:40:39,665 --> 01:40:46,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Now are we talking like actual free stuff like, I don't know, the Amazing Frog and the Parking Valet or No Breaks Valet and the stuff that's actually free on there?

1288
01:40:47,092 --> 01:40:47,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think emulators?

1289
01:40:48,914 --> 01:40:51,015
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's just that they're playing a lot of the free stuff.

1290
01:40:51,116 --> 01:41:00,464
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that it's necessarily... I think that a lot of the developers on there are... Yeah, 73% of owners haven't bought a thing.

1291
01:41:00,865 --> 01:41:02,386
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think right now that

1292
01:41:04,355 --> 01:41:11,100
[SPEAKER_11]: I think some of the developers that are on there probably have never published the game before.

1293
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:17,505
[SPEAKER_11]: They may not know how much of the game to give away for free.

1294
01:41:18,185 --> 01:41:29,894
[SPEAKER_11]: There was something, I don't remember which game it was, where they were saying they had certain difficulty levels that were available and the higher difficulties were behind a paywall.

1295
01:41:30,254 --> 01:41:30,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1296
01:41:47,496 --> 01:42:09,071
[SPEAKER_11]: so it's just I think it's a lot of it's just experiment a lot of new people putting stuff on there that you know they may not be they may not know all the tricks to being able to bring in revenue on that kind of pay model you know it leads us to this interesting comment in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com from our pal Bobby Blackwolf who says why buy games when you can pirate them so easily

1297
01:42:10,322 --> 01:42:15,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's the thing, though, is you can't really pirate Ouya games too easily on there, at least as far as I'm aware.

1298
01:42:15,965 --> 01:42:23,950
[SPEAKER_11]: You can pirate all other Android games on there quite easily, but you can't pirate Ouya games themselves very easily that I've seen.

1299
01:42:25,411 --> 01:42:33,896
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, because they don't have the Google Play Marketplace tied to this console, there's nothing to check for the authenticity of...

1300
01:42:35,077 --> 01:42:47,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Those purchases, so anything you sideload on there, if you happen to download a random API for anything, it will just run it, full version or whatever, and it'll just run it without having to purchase it.

1301
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:55,004
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, in that sense, it is really easy to pirate games on there, but for the actual Ouya games, it's not, because of the way they have it.

1302
01:42:55,064 --> 01:42:57,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, that could very well change if, you know...

1303
01:42:58,817 --> 01:43:07,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what they would have to do to do that or if they can even put the Google Play Store on there I know you can sideload that but yeah it's just

1304
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:09,220
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1305
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:35,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Why spend the money on an Ouya when you can just spend your money on something else that works a lot better?

1306
01:43:36,093 --> 01:43:39,214
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like a lot of people have taken the Ouya concept and made it better.

1307
01:43:41,714 --> 01:43:43,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, there's not really anything.

1308
01:43:43,335 --> 01:43:45,236
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't just put out another Ouya right now.

1309
01:43:45,856 --> 01:43:50,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be very interesting to see where the Ouya ends up in about six months, right?

1310
01:43:50,778 --> 01:43:50,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1311
01:43:51,298 --> 01:43:51,838
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

1312
01:43:52,578 --> 01:43:58,683
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow, moving on to another news story about a game you're not going to be able to get on the OUYA, but probably about everywhere else.

1313
01:43:59,123 --> 01:44:00,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney Infinity.

1314
01:44:00,805 --> 01:44:06,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Disney Infinity, of course, has Toy Box, which is like the creation mode, which, you know, makes me kind of think at first about like LittleBigPlanet.

1315
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:11,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize really how powerful this is until I saw this video.

1316
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:16,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this video, somebody basically recreated Super Mario Bros.

1317
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:16,918
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-1.

1318
01:44:17,558 --> 01:44:23,323
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's weird to me about this video is that, like, isn't this, like, an official type of, like, trailer or whatever?

1319
01:44:23,583 --> 01:44:23,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1320
01:44:24,144 --> 01:44:31,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, what's interesting about this is that they actually show, like, there's the little staircase with Buzz Lightyear going to a flagpole, and it's like, wait a minute!

1321
01:44:32,231 --> 01:44:32,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute!

1322
01:44:33,132 --> 01:44:33,712
Wait a minute!

1323
01:44:33,852 --> 01:44:37,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't level 1-1 kind of... It's not similar with LittleBigPlanet 2.

1324
01:44:37,256 --> 01:44:38,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

1325
01:44:38,257 --> 01:44:42,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be fair, it's just one small component that you see in the video here.

1326
01:44:42,241 --> 01:44:43,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, wow, it looks very powerful.

1327
01:44:44,723 --> 01:44:47,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And are you going to be able to share these across the internet and all that good stuff?

1328
01:44:47,766 --> 01:44:49,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you will be able to.

1329
01:44:49,368 --> 01:44:50,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you will be able to.

1330
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:51,550
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be an interesting game.

1331
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:52,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting player.

1332
01:44:52,511 --> 01:44:54,793
[SPEAKER_11]: I've already seen some of the next characters coming out too.

1333
01:44:54,953 --> 01:44:55,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah?

1334
01:44:55,354 --> 01:44:55,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what?

1335
01:44:56,174 --> 01:44:56,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they've got...

1336
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:04,462
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not stuff that's new because they've shown them in the trailers already.

1337
01:45:06,564 --> 01:45:08,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect example right here.

1338
01:45:08,445 --> 01:45:10,728
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to have the stuff from Wreck-It Ralph.

1339
01:45:11,148 --> 01:45:15,892
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to have a Wreck-It Ralph play set, but they're going to have a Wreck-It Ralph... They're going to introduce a new thing.

1340
01:45:16,132 --> 01:45:18,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of the play sets, it's a...

1341
01:45:19,235 --> 01:45:42,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Toybox set basically it's the characters and you get pieces for the toy box instead of you know an actual play set they're gonna have a Toy Story one coming out Jack Skellington around the same time and then I think in the Toy Story one it's Buzz Lightyear and because I haven't watched Toy Story 2 it's the the female cowboy

1342
01:45:44,175 --> 01:45:44,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesse.

1343
01:45:44,915 --> 01:45:48,797
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be Buzz and Jesse and then Woody sold separately.

1344
01:45:52,499 --> 01:45:54,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Buzz has Jesse and no Woody.

1345
01:45:55,681 --> 01:46:00,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's just they always put a female character in there because they want the appeal.

1346
01:46:01,244 --> 01:46:03,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for the starter pack, it's all males.

1347
01:46:03,546 --> 01:46:10,009
[SPEAKER_11]: But for cars and stuff, they try to put a female character in there so that girls will buy it too.

1348
01:46:10,069 --> 01:46:12,050
[SPEAKER_11]: So they can play as the girl characters and stuff like that.

1349
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:12,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1350
01:46:13,231 --> 01:46:41,147
[SPEAKER_11]: but yeah it looks fun I mean it's expensive I just don't want to buy all those characters any word about like exclusive figures only at parks or things like that I haven't heard of anything yet I mean they haven't really said that they're gonna do stuff like that it might come later on like next year I mean assuming this all takes off I know Skylanders does that they have exclusive characters for Toys R Us but usually they're just recolored characters and it's dumb

1351
01:46:42,868 --> 01:46:43,368
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura?

1352
01:46:45,290 --> 01:46:46,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I got tangled.

1353
01:46:47,131 --> 01:46:48,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And not in a fun way either.

1354
01:46:49,373 --> 01:46:56,178
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, we've talked a little bit about the Oculus Rift thing, about how kind of creepy it can be.

1355
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Creepy awesome.

1356
01:47:01,022 --> 01:47:07,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there is a Japanese sex game that will be bringing out Oculus Rift support.

1357
01:47:08,608 --> 01:47:08,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1358
01:47:10,709 --> 01:47:17,292
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is called Custom Made 3D, and it basically lets you create a maid that you can play with.

1359
01:47:17,953 --> 01:47:21,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And it comes with a controller called the Juicy Air Support.

1360
01:47:22,655 --> 01:47:27,417
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a move controller, but it is... It's a fleshlight controller.

1361
01:47:27,457 --> 01:47:27,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

1362
01:47:28,698 --> 01:47:29,118
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1363
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:33,841
[SPEAKER_09]: So now, even though the game's been out for a little bit, it's got Oculus Rift support.

1364
01:47:33,861 --> 01:47:34,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1365
01:47:34,861 --> 01:47:39,346
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can get your action a little bit more up close and personal.

1366
01:47:41,688 --> 01:47:42,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1367
01:47:44,231 --> 01:47:45,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1368
01:47:45,693 --> 01:47:46,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Cutting edge.

1369
01:47:48,753 --> 01:47:51,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you're into, have fun with that.

1370
01:47:51,556 --> 01:47:52,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever sinks your battleship.

1371
01:47:52,697 --> 01:47:53,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that whole thing.

1372
01:47:53,798 --> 01:47:55,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, we've talked about this on the show before, right?

1373
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:02,285
[SPEAKER_04]: TTP, which is for time to penis, which usually is about peripherals.

1374
01:48:02,485 --> 01:48:07,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is, how long will it take when they release this peripheral for someone to stick their dick in it?

1375
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:17,832
[SPEAKER_11]: or how long will it take for someone to create a giant phallus in their toy box?

1376
01:48:17,852 --> 01:48:18,292
[SPEAKER_11]: 10 seconds.

1377
01:48:21,313 --> 01:48:24,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another further proof of that.

1378
01:48:24,154 --> 01:48:29,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So this great new technology comes out how long before somebody figures out how to work in wieners and boobs?

1379
01:48:30,495 --> 01:48:34,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure this isn't necessarily the first attempt either as those development kits have been out for a bit.

1380
01:48:36,116 --> 01:48:38,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, just a few more stories for you guys in the mailbag.

1381
01:48:38,897 --> 01:48:39,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1382
01:48:40,217 --> 01:48:52,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so Nintendo is now working to draw some indie support as well to the Wii U. Already, it's pretty easy to publish indie titles on the Wii U, and you do see a lot of indie games coming to the Wii U, especially a lot of Kickstarter-backed stuff.

1383
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:56,500
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll see, like, hey, we're making a Wii U version of it as well.

1384
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:00,021
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, there were some comments done by...

1385
01:49:02,502 --> 01:49:24,085
[SPEAKER_11]: some of these indie developers including I guess Daco Daco is one of the studios they have a game called Scram Kitty and his buddy on the rails or buddy on rails and that'll be coming to Wii U basically they don't shout very loud about it but they are working hard behind the scenes to make their platform as welcoming as possible I gotta see what the hell this game is

1386
01:49:24,705 --> 01:49:25,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that's kind of neat.

1387
01:49:26,266 --> 01:49:27,386
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got a cat.

1388
01:49:28,026 --> 01:49:28,907
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks kind of evil.

1389
01:49:29,767 --> 01:49:32,828
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a... Puzzle platformer?

1390
01:49:33,208 --> 01:49:35,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, neat.

1391
01:49:35,949 --> 01:49:46,493
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, they're saying that... Former... I can't even pronounce this guy.

1392
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:50,275
[SPEAKER_11]: This company, Niam Niam... Where...

1393
01:49:51,147 --> 01:49:53,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Niam Niam, I think that's Niam Niam.

1394
01:49:53,368 --> 01:49:53,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Niam Niam.

1395
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:55,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Niam Niam.

1396
01:49:55,369 --> 01:49:56,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to say Nom Nom.

1397
01:49:56,429 --> 01:49:57,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Nom Nom.

1398
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:01,131
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying they focus quality over quantity.

1399
01:50:02,672 --> 01:50:09,655
[SPEAKER_11]: They're actively seeking indies, but they're looking for quality, experienced developers that can maybe form a longer-term relationship.

1400
01:50:12,116 --> 01:50:16,478
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess they're bringing Tengami is the game they're bringing there.

1401
01:50:16,938 --> 01:50:20,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Dreamfall Chapters Dreamfall Chapters

1402
01:50:40,512 --> 01:50:41,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1403
01:50:58,044 --> 01:50:58,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Lolo Ranger

1404
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:30,982
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lone Ranger, the Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges movie really tanked too that just came out like last week.

1405
01:51:31,002 --> 01:51:31,422
[SPEAKER_04]: R.I.P.D.?

1406
01:51:31,482 --> 01:51:33,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that one really tanked too.

1407
01:51:33,542 --> 01:51:42,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know some of these companies are having to take big losses on these and that's why a lot of movie companies really prefer to find these low budget movies that don't cost a lot of money that make...

1408
01:51:43,925 --> 01:51:44,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan Reynolds Deadpool

1409
01:52:05,404 --> 01:52:05,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a good example.

1410
01:52:05,904 --> 01:52:06,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Clerks.

1411
01:52:34,475 --> 01:52:34,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1412
01:52:35,576 --> 01:52:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.

1413
01:52:36,316 --> 01:52:37,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much any movie that guy makes.

1414
01:52:37,817 --> 01:52:39,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for Jersey Girl.

1415
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:40,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mallrats.

1416
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:42,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Mallrats was great.

1417
01:52:42,161 --> 01:52:44,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a good movie, but it didn't profit, really.

1418
01:52:45,323 --> 01:52:47,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of his movies profit, unfortunately.

1419
01:52:47,704 --> 01:52:48,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow.

1420
01:52:48,265 --> 01:52:50,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how we got on that tangent.

1421
01:52:50,887 --> 01:52:55,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess because about indie games, there's a potential for better return on investment there.

1422
01:52:55,570 --> 01:52:56,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I know exactly how it happened.

1423
01:52:57,691 --> 01:53:00,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the same thing also happens in the movie industry.

1424
01:53:00,313 --> 01:53:00,974
[SPEAKER_09]: For example...

1425
01:53:02,634 --> 01:53:06,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I totally forgot this movie came out this weekend.

1426
01:53:06,398 --> 01:53:08,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw said he saw The Wolverine.

1427
01:53:08,621 --> 01:53:11,264
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wolverine came out this week and did really well at the box office.

1428
01:53:11,304 --> 01:53:12,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It literally made back its budget.

1429
01:53:12,906 --> 01:53:14,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Wanna see it?

1430
01:53:14,968 --> 01:53:17,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, but... It looks so terrible, too, and that's kind of...

1431
01:53:18,979 --> 01:53:21,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, as an 80s Wolverine reader, we're forgiving.

1432
01:53:22,061 --> 01:53:24,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The weird thing to me is that I thought they already made a Wolverine movie.

1433
01:53:25,824 --> 01:53:29,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess this is like a sequel or whatever, or a different direction.

1434
01:53:29,286 --> 01:53:32,128
[SPEAKER_09]: This is taking on the whole Wolverine in Japan arc.

1435
01:53:32,248 --> 01:53:33,188
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the same guy.

1436
01:53:33,228 --> 01:53:33,989
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird to me.

1437
01:53:34,149 --> 01:53:35,089
[SPEAKER_09]: He's, I don't care.

1438
01:53:35,189 --> 01:53:35,730
[SPEAKER_09]: He's pretty.

1439
01:53:35,890 --> 01:53:38,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Hugh Jackman is a good actor, you know, just on the general.

1440
01:53:39,132 --> 01:53:39,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to pet him.

1441
01:53:41,193 --> 01:53:43,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that his wife would like that, but I don't care.

1442
01:53:43,094 --> 01:53:43,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you do.

1443
01:53:43,675 --> 01:53:44,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you do.

1444
01:53:44,522 --> 01:53:45,822
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

1445
01:53:45,862 --> 01:53:53,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure some of you guys saw this crazy video that was out there on the internet this week where some folks were driving a car with a Nintendo controller.

1446
01:53:53,724 --> 01:54:04,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, obviously, there are limits to this, but cables that connect the controller to the electronic unit inside the car, a 2010 Ford Escape and a Toyota Prius.

1447
01:54:04,967 --> 01:54:11,949
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a project funded by DARPA, and it's to raise awareness about over-reliance on computer systems and vehicles.

1448
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:22,975
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the researchers who goes by Charlie Miller said, quote, we would love for everyone to start having a discussion about this and for manufacturers to listen and improve the security of cars.

1449
01:54:23,415 --> 01:54:25,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's how most people are taking this.

1450
01:54:25,136 --> 01:54:27,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most people are looking at it going, cool.

1451
01:54:27,898 --> 01:54:29,299
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Mario Kart for real.

1452
01:54:29,519 --> 01:54:31,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, we have operatorless cars.

1453
01:54:31,718 --> 01:54:33,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Driver's School Driver's School

1454
01:54:47,708 --> 01:54:48,169
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1455
01:55:02,725 --> 01:55:03,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Echolocation sensors, I think.

1456
01:55:20,208 --> 01:55:20,508
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1457
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:23,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that brings us to the mailbag.

1458
01:55:23,431 --> 01:55:27,836
[SPEAKER_04]: And every week you guys can email us at mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

1459
01:55:28,296 --> 01:55:32,620
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura will dive in the mailbag head first and hopefully she won't find the anthrax.

1460
01:55:33,662 --> 01:55:34,442
[SPEAKER_04]: But she will.

1461
01:55:34,803 --> 01:55:39,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking about an 80s metal band, but she will find some excellent emails.

1462
01:55:39,367 --> 01:55:43,011
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's anthrax and a public enemy, sign me up.

1463
01:55:43,251 --> 01:55:43,571
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1464
01:55:44,052 --> 01:55:46,774
[SPEAKER_04]: She will find some of your emails to read here live on air.

1465
01:55:47,015 --> 01:55:49,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1466
01:55:49,477 --> 01:55:54,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Please feel free to email us unless you are a spammer, in which case you can fuck right off.

1467
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:55,042
[SPEAKER_04]: You can fuck off and die.

1468
01:55:55,082 --> 01:55:55,583
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1469
01:55:57,044 --> 01:56:02,009
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually have had a last-minute, looks like, email that came after the show last week.

1470
01:56:02,769 --> 01:56:10,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I emailed earlier but forgot to ask, is it possible that for the FUs of the week you could play the old Final Fantasy Advent Children's Life Raw theme?

1471
01:56:10,892 --> 01:56:12,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I miss it so bad.

1472
01:56:12,632 --> 01:56:14,813
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be badly, by the way, that's an adverb.

1473
01:56:15,713 --> 01:56:16,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks again, Reesimo.

1474
01:56:17,233 --> 01:56:17,774
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you say?

1475
01:56:17,814 --> 01:56:19,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I try to dig that up and give this guy his wish?

1476
01:56:19,874 --> 01:56:20,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1477
01:56:20,294 --> 01:56:20,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1478
01:56:20,674 --> 01:56:21,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'll dig that up while you replay.

1479
01:56:21,875 --> 01:56:24,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Only if you use adverbs correctly in the future.

1480
01:56:26,036 --> 01:56:27,697
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not so bad, it's so badly.

1481
01:56:27,937 --> 01:56:31,119
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a conditional granted request.

1482
01:56:31,159 --> 01:56:32,420
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having some faith in you.

1483
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:34,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't say I want that so bad.

1484
01:56:35,061 --> 01:56:35,922
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe in you.

1485
01:56:35,942 --> 01:56:37,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I want that so badly.

1486
01:56:37,402 --> 01:56:39,503
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe in you, but don't you dare let us down.

1487
01:56:42,985 --> 01:56:43,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1488
01:56:43,706 --> 01:56:43,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Awful.

1489
01:56:45,942 --> 01:56:47,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Please call me Surtr.

1490
01:56:47,343 --> 01:56:47,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Surtr.

1491
01:56:49,104 --> 01:56:49,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, OLR.

1492
01:56:49,865 --> 01:56:52,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I know DarkSakura has been having house buying drama.

1493
01:56:52,367 --> 01:56:53,808
[SPEAKER_09]: God, no shit, especially today.

1494
01:56:54,288 --> 01:56:56,310
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought I'd encourage her with my own success story.

1495
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:58,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Or make me jealous, I don't know.

1496
01:56:58,711 --> 01:57:03,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a long-term renter and I've been saving for a home, but I needed that final push to start the arduous home buying process.

1497
01:57:03,755 --> 01:57:09,097
[SPEAKER_09]: The spring I was playing Animal Crossing Wild World on my 3DS XL and paying my loan to Nook and it hit me.

1498
01:57:09,178 --> 01:57:10,838
[SPEAKER_09]: I should be paying off a mortgage for reals.

1499
01:57:11,338 --> 01:57:13,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Long story short, I'm closing on house on August 19th.

1500
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:15,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Next I plan on getting married after playing Harvest Moon.

1501
01:57:16,941 --> 01:57:17,681
[SPEAKER_09]: You gonna get a cow?

1502
01:57:17,981 --> 01:57:20,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, is this for real or is this kind of troll?

1503
01:57:20,883 --> 01:57:21,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.

1504
01:57:21,983 --> 01:57:23,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I kind of, like, you seriously?

1505
01:57:23,984 --> 01:57:25,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sometimes people have aha moments.

1506
01:57:25,885 --> 01:57:26,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

1507
01:57:27,186 --> 01:57:36,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry if I called you a troll, but it's just kind of amusing to me that you played Animal Crossing and you realized, wow, I should go get a house for real.

1508
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:40,151
[SPEAKER_04]: But then the whole, I should go get a girlfriend for real, that's where I'm starting to go.

1509
01:57:40,171 --> 01:57:41,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this such a troll?

1510
01:57:41,191 --> 01:57:41,612
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1511
01:57:41,672 --> 01:57:42,172
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny.

1512
01:57:42,632 --> 01:57:43,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually...

1513
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:45,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey y'all Hey

1514
01:58:11,752 --> 01:58:12,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha!

1515
01:58:12,192 --> 01:58:13,813
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from Osfer.

1516
01:58:14,753 --> 01:58:15,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god, this is long.

1517
01:58:15,814 --> 01:58:16,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it!

1518
01:58:16,354 --> 01:58:16,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop!

1519
01:58:17,855 --> 01:58:23,577
[SPEAKER_09]: In the weeks following this year's E3 showing, I sought out other video game podcasts to listen to, in addition to yours, of course.

1520
01:58:23,797 --> 01:58:24,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

1521
01:58:24,677 --> 01:58:31,120
[SPEAKER_09]: While I did enjoy some of the other shows I heard, I came to the realization that the host of OLR is what truly gives it a solid advantage over the rest of the competition.

1522
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:32,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we do.

1523
01:58:32,140 --> 01:58:32,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shucks.

1524
01:58:33,841 --> 01:58:40,124
[SPEAKER_09]: You have three hosts, each with very different backgrounds, and each of which cover a different social aspect and identity.

1525
01:58:40,604 --> 01:58:43,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I love what each personality brings to the table as well, and I love your grammar.

1526
01:58:44,765 --> 01:58:53,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, while often funny, yet ranty voice of the show, plays an important role of speaking openly his thoughts on what a lot of gamers might have on their minds, but might not have the balls to speak it.

1527
01:58:53,849 --> 01:58:55,811
[SPEAKER_09]: His rants are welcome, at least by myself.

1528
01:58:56,371 --> 01:59:04,238
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got an amazing head on his shoulders and shows that he's very knowledgeable about the industry as a whole.

1529
01:59:04,338 --> 01:59:08,622
[SPEAKER_09]: These rants only happen because he's a guy that truly cares about the games and the gamers who play them.

1530
01:59:08,642 --> 01:59:12,526
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, DarkSakura, long emails are okay when they exist to inflate our egos a little bit.

1531
01:59:12,626 --> 01:59:13,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

1532
01:59:13,506 --> 01:59:14,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep going, sir.

1533
01:59:14,467 --> 01:59:14,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep going.

1534
01:59:14,968 --> 01:59:16,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, it's the part about me next.

1535
01:59:16,769 --> 01:59:17,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1536
01:59:17,490 --> 01:59:18,531
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura is a bitch.

1537
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:18,711
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1538
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:19,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1539
01:59:21,593 --> 01:59:22,554
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1540
01:59:24,374 --> 01:59:30,916
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura is a very admirable host due to her ways in which she approaches deep gaming discussions or discussions on any topic for that matter.

1541
01:59:31,056 --> 01:59:32,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you saying I get off topic?

1542
01:59:32,577 --> 01:59:32,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1543
01:59:33,497 --> 01:59:40,160
[SPEAKER_09]: While sometimes she may be quiet for the initial talk between Rob and Loki, you can tell she has been gathering her thoughts to make some great points.

1544
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:41,440
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she hasn't.

1545
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:42,520
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been catching bugs.

1546
01:59:43,161 --> 01:59:43,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not.

1547
01:59:44,361 --> 01:59:47,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I turned off Animal Crossing in the middle of Bobby's show just because I had a visitor.

1548
01:59:48,062 --> 01:59:49,903
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been crocheting the whole time, but I've been listening.

1549
01:59:50,123 --> 01:59:52,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Her penis cozy is now like a boa constrictor cozy.

1550
01:59:53,164 --> 01:59:57,666
[SPEAKER_11]: You're really going to have a limited target demographic with that one.

1551
01:59:58,406 --> 01:59:58,886
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1552
01:59:59,946 --> 02:00:00,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say this.

1553
02:00:01,447 --> 02:00:04,008
[SPEAKER_09]: It helps me concentrate to have something to do with my hands.

1554
02:00:05,578 --> 02:00:30,042
[SPEAKER_09]: and as a corporate trainer during the day I can actually say that as like some people when they are actually like moving their hands it's very like they actually learn more that's why they encourage it's called kinesthetic learning oh I know I like at one meeting when I was working for the student loan place and they put out Legos to see if we retained more by playing with Legos I built a little tower but I remembered more anyway where was I more stuff about me okay

1555
02:00:34,566 --> 02:00:58,575
[SPEAKER_09]: just been gathering her thoughts to make some great points and also quick to point out something the other hosts may have missed she's an awesome listener and I really admire her desire to understand what others may have trouble communicating such as the incident of an angry email the show received that bashed another host close to the OLR family even through that she calmly read through and restated the point the email was trying to get across gaming wise and that's pretty freaking awesome that she even gave it the chance well thank you

1556
02:01:00,586 --> 02:01:03,069
[SPEAKER_04]: You were a saint for giving that email a chance, but yes.

1557
02:01:04,832 --> 02:01:05,613
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's Rob.

1558
02:01:07,115 --> 02:01:08,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, then there's that guy.

1559
02:01:08,657 --> 02:01:10,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Some may say he's the glue that holds the show together.

1560
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:15,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Others may poke fun at him for making flappy hands while taking a single shot of some sort of outfit.

1561
02:01:15,546 --> 02:01:16,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1562
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:32,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh oh.

1563
02:01:52,205 --> 02:01:58,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, as a gay gamer, you've certainly felt what it's like to be pressured by your family before coming out to them.

1564
02:01:59,430 --> 02:02:06,975
[SPEAKER_09]: You must know what it's like to have them wondering why you aren't trying to find a girlfriend or to feel that pressure that you have to please them by giving them grandchildren one day.

1565
02:02:07,615 --> 02:02:11,658
[SPEAKER_09]: at least you might have felt that until you came out to them how did you do it?

1566
02:02:11,958 --> 02:02:33,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked because very recently I was on a walk with my dad he's very conservative, often scoffing at any gay issue that he sees that comes up in the news yet when I showed him concerns about my uncle telling us that you choose to be gay and if you're gay you're going to hell obviously this isn't true and when I told him that I had sour feelings toward him because of it he said you shouldn't hate someone because of something they said they might just be uninformed

1567
02:02:33,872 --> 02:02:38,953
[SPEAKER_09]: After this you followed up with you can be with whoever you want with as long as it makes you happy.

1568
02:02:39,053 --> 02:02:41,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care what you want to do with your life as long as it satisfies that.

1569
02:02:42,874 --> 02:02:44,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I just tell my parents that I'm gay?

1570
02:02:45,614 --> 02:02:50,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is a tough question but I don't know anyone better to come out to about this except for yourself.

1571
02:02:51,516 --> 02:02:54,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make my decision based on what you tell me following this email.

1572
02:02:55,597 --> 02:02:56,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Sincerely, Osfer.

1573
02:02:57,217 --> 02:02:58,257
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

1574
02:02:58,477 --> 02:03:00,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Really sorry this email is a bit long.

1575
02:03:00,078 --> 02:03:01,118
[SPEAKER_09]: I just need some thoughts out there.

1576
02:03:01,518 --> 02:03:02,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I say one thing?

1577
02:03:02,888 --> 02:03:03,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

1578
02:03:03,529 --> 02:03:04,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually your parents know.

1579
02:03:05,672 --> 02:03:08,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this is what I was going to get to as well.

1580
02:03:08,576 --> 02:03:17,889
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very heavy email and not about games, but I'm all about there's more to gaming than the games themselves, if that makes sense.

1581
02:03:18,249 --> 02:03:18,690
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1582
02:03:42,668 --> 02:03:44,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1583
02:04:00,339 --> 02:04:01,359
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1584
02:04:21,325 --> 02:04:22,386
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

1585
02:04:45,974 --> 02:05:09,513
[SPEAKER_04]: because the first thing my grandma said when my mom said Rob's gay is my grandma said so what which is a great thing I realize though that I'm very fortunate in that regard where I have a very cool supportive environment and not everybody is so lucky like your uncle sounds like a bit of a knob you know unfortunately you may not get that same level of support from him and

1586
02:05:09,933 --> 02:05:21,324
[SPEAKER_04]: The point I wanted to get at, though, is that the reason why my mom escalated in asking me the question is that apparently, unbeknownst to me, I had a female friend stay the night at my place once while I was in college.

1587
02:05:21,684 --> 02:05:25,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And she called her parents to ask if it was okay to stay over.

1588
02:05:25,668 --> 02:05:28,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, even though she was kind of whispering on the phone, she said, no, it's fine.

1589
02:05:28,851 --> 02:05:29,232
[SPEAKER_04]: He's gay.

1590
02:05:29,772 --> 02:05:30,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's going to happen.

1591
02:05:31,093 --> 02:05:32,435
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom overheard that conversation.

1592
02:05:34,230 --> 02:05:38,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So she already knew and she was waiting for me to tell her.

1593
02:05:39,394 --> 02:05:43,138
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said later on, she's like, you know, I've always suspected since you were younger.

1594
02:05:44,058 --> 02:05:52,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a big fan of that because I don't think that certain behaviors are indicative of certain sexuality.

1595
02:05:52,926 --> 02:06:00,392
[SPEAKER_04]: We could get into this whole larger discussion about gender norms and, you know, being effeminate and gay is not necessarily the same thing.

1596
02:06:00,592 --> 02:06:01,973
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1597
02:06:24,324 --> 02:06:45,585
[SPEAKER_04]: is it possible your parents have come across something that maybe they already have this indication and they're waiting for you to tell them now I think as far as you telling them that is really up to you you know best when the right time to tell them is I think sometimes there's a lot of pressure in the gay community to be like come out come out wherever you are come out get out of the closet da da da

1598
02:06:46,145 --> 02:06:55,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little bit more of the mindset of that is a little bit more of a utopian view of where we should be but it is quite frankly dangerous in some areas to do that.

1599
02:06:55,631 --> 02:07:12,242
[SPEAKER_04]: So my advice to you is if you are out on your own and living on your own and doing your own thing and making your own choices then guess what you get to live your own life and I think yeah I think it might be a good time for you to tell your parents about this especially if you get this indication that they already know.

1600
02:07:12,842 --> 02:07:40,921
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you're still living at home and there's the chance there could be an ugly backlash you need to have a backup plan if you're going to tell them just in case and I pray to you that you don't have to use it and I really hope that you don't have to use that plan B but it is the smart thing to do just in case but if they did already know it might have already been ugly so I really have to say I can't sit here

1601
02:07:42,341 --> 02:07:44,822
[SPEAKER_04]: and say, yes, do it or no, don't do it.

1602
02:07:44,902 --> 02:07:45,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Because guess what?

1603
02:07:45,742 --> 02:07:46,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know your parents.

1604
02:07:46,602 --> 02:07:47,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know your life.

1605
02:07:47,503 --> 02:07:49,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the way you conduct yourself on a day-to-day basis.

1606
02:07:50,403 --> 02:07:52,564
[SPEAKER_04]: You really know the answer to this question.

1607
02:07:52,984 --> 02:07:57,625
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're in a place where your life where you can be your own person, then I say, you know what?

1608
02:07:58,946 --> 02:07:59,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and tell them.

1609
02:08:01,206 --> 02:08:08,670
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, remember your friends, your real friends will always support you through this no matter what.

1610
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:11,311
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the most important thing.

1611
02:08:11,971 --> 02:08:16,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say this, I don't want to get into this too much on a video game podcast.

1612
02:08:17,713 --> 02:08:21,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, in my mind, I did lose a brother to this issue.

1613
02:08:21,955 --> 02:08:23,356
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still alive and all that stuff.

1614
02:08:23,476 --> 02:08:24,116
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't speak.

1615
02:08:24,176 --> 02:08:25,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't spoken to him for a very long time.

1616
02:08:26,397 --> 02:08:47,631
[SPEAKER_04]: and it is partially because of this issue and there will be some tough decisions you have to make along those lines but you know what I may have lost a brother there but I have made so many other close male friends that like honestly I would consider brothers that are more brothers to me than my my

1617
02:08:49,452 --> 02:08:50,253
[SPEAKER_04]: It's complicated.

1618
02:08:50,294 --> 02:08:51,135
[SPEAKER_04]: He's actually adopted.

1619
02:08:51,175 --> 02:08:52,437
[SPEAKER_04]: But my biological amusement.

1620
02:08:52,457 --> 02:08:53,138
[SPEAKER_09]: The one you grew up with.

1621
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:56,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not even that because he was 14 when I was born.

1622
02:08:57,745 --> 02:08:58,586
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother-brother.

1623
02:08:58,687 --> 02:08:59,227
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll say that.

1624
02:09:00,730 --> 02:09:04,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel closely to these guys than I do my mother-brother.

1625
02:09:05,618 --> 02:09:07,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, that's my very long-winded answer.

1626
02:09:08,179 --> 02:09:12,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for the folks that were here to listen for the games, but maybe you were curious.

1627
02:09:12,381 --> 02:09:12,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1628
02:09:13,002 --> 02:09:18,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, and it's... He might be the only person out there having that same sort of thought, too.

1629
02:09:18,924 --> 02:09:22,686
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if it benefits somebody, then by all means, ask the difficult questions.

1630
02:09:22,946 --> 02:09:23,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so...

1631
02:09:24,728 --> 02:09:45,747
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know what if you're if you're straight out there listening to this and you know maybe you don't you know take this little feedback I'm giving to Osfer here as maybe like a little bit of perspective like maybe this is why we need an event like GamerX because a lot of people respond to something like GamerX going well when's the straight gaming convention or

1632
02:09:46,448 --> 02:10:14,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well when your parents kick you out of your house for being straight and you get persecuted by society for that and you are treated as a second class citizen and people pass laws against the way you are Look at Russia right now Then you can get your fucking con These are the same people who ask when we have White Pride Month Some people need a safe place Thank your white privilege that you have a safe place Yeah

1633
02:10:15,435 --> 02:10:17,559
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm gonna say and I'll get off my soapbox.

1634
02:10:17,839 --> 02:10:19,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God that shit pisses me off.

1635
02:10:19,723 --> 02:10:21,506
[SPEAKER_04]: When do I get my straight pride parade?

1636
02:10:21,786 --> 02:10:23,509
[SPEAKER_04]: You get it every single fucking day.

[SPEAKER_09]: So next email?

[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Loki, DarkSakura, and Rob.

1642
02:10:34,884 --> 02:10:36,245
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your friendly neighborhood Raginator.

1643
02:10:36,345 --> 02:10:42,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Provided that there is enough time in tonight's show, I'd like to propose that you do something akin to combining listless and classic game of the week.

1644
02:10:42,208 --> 02:10:45,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not come up with a definitive top ten list of classic games that people should play?

1645
02:10:46,325 --> 02:10:47,326
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1646
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:43,409
[SPEAKER_09]: but I like your idea maybe for other topics like we need to do more like special shows and one-off things so it'll be fun yeah well um I think that's let me check and see if there's any more emails um in Korean no it's in Mandarin oh there's a thank you mail yay oh wow this is okay we got one more good thing I checked isn't it dear OLR I wanted to send you a quick email to thank you for putting on a great show for so many years

1647
02:11:43,929 --> 02:11:52,399
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't always agree, but I always enjoy listening to OLR and I look forward to the next-gen discussions that will take place once we get the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in hand.

1648
02:11:52,879 --> 02:11:59,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I look forward to the day when we can separate fact from fiction and conversations will be steered toward how fun Knack is or how I lapped Black Wolf in Forza 5.

1649
02:12:01,168 --> 02:12:07,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I also look forward to adding everyone to my friends list on Xbox Live and PSN once the friends cap is raised with these new systems.

1650
02:12:08,211 --> 02:12:20,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I know everyone likes to think I'm an Xbox fanboy but I am truly looking forward to experiencing what Sony and Microsoft have to offer us over the next five years or so as well as what Nintendo will be bringing to the table as well.

1651
02:12:21,016 --> 02:12:26,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully I can accept Rob's invitation to visit OLR in person at some point since I only live a few hours away in Fresno.

1652
02:12:26,662 --> 02:12:27,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so sorry.

1653
02:12:27,803 --> 02:12:29,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the great work.

1654
02:12:29,784 --> 02:12:33,688
[SPEAKER_04]: When I ran into him at E3, I was like, you live in Fresno.

1655
02:12:33,728 --> 02:12:34,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you drive up sometime?

1656
02:12:35,009 --> 02:12:37,932
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a dude from Bakersfield come up and do the MS walk with us.

1657
02:12:37,992 --> 02:12:40,214
[SPEAKER_04]: If he can do that, you can do this.

1658
02:12:40,615 --> 02:12:42,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, open invite, Shadow Next Gen.

1659
02:12:42,176 --> 02:12:42,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on over sometimes.

1660
02:12:43,397 --> 02:12:44,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for the email.

1661
02:12:44,098 --> 02:12:44,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry for Fresno.

1662
02:12:47,682 --> 02:12:48,784
[SPEAKER_04]: It's halfway to Disneyland.

1663
02:12:48,804 --> 02:12:49,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of it that way.

1664
02:12:49,825 --> 02:12:51,448
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's near the Bravo Cheese Farms.

1665
02:12:51,588 --> 02:12:53,510
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the good things that Fresno did?

1666
02:12:53,871 --> 02:12:55,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to a Weird Al concert.

1667
02:12:55,774 --> 02:12:56,294
[SPEAKER_09]: That was cool.

1668
02:12:58,898 --> 02:12:59,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

1669
02:12:59,199 --> 02:13:00,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thank you very much for the emails.

1670
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:01,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, Bobby.

1671
02:13:01,442 --> 02:13:01,682
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1672
02:13:01,722 --> 02:13:04,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Shadow Next Gen, you shut up about your Forza lapping.

1673
02:13:06,041 --> 02:13:06,321
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1674
02:13:06,942 --> 02:13:07,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much.

1675
02:13:07,942 --> 02:13:09,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Some really kind emails tonight.

1676
02:13:10,164 --> 02:13:10,824
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys rule.

1677
02:13:10,864 --> 02:13:13,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we got a little heavy with one of those emails, it was a good discussion.

1678
02:13:14,266 --> 02:13:14,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys rule.

1679
02:13:15,287 --> 02:13:15,507
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1680
02:13:15,567 --> 02:13:26,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So speaking of emailers, we shall grant the wish of one of our emailers tonight and bring on the FUs of the week with an old school song from Orange Lounge Radio, what we used to use for the FUs of the week.

1681
02:13:26,133 --> 02:13:27,434
[SPEAKER_09]: It has my stabby part in it.

1682
02:13:27,514 --> 02:13:27,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1683
02:13:27,874 --> 02:13:29,795
[SPEAKER_04]: With murder.

1684
02:13:29,855 --> 02:13:30,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1685
02:13:30,616 --> 02:13:31,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1686
02:13:31,216 --> 02:13:32,377
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the FUs of the week time.

1687
02:13:43,143 --> 02:13:45,565
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU goes towards losing that house.

1688
02:13:46,405 --> 02:13:53,910
[SPEAKER_09]: We had been told we lost the house, but turns out that it had actually been an old message, so we thought we got it, and it turns out we didn't.

1689
02:13:55,571 --> 02:14:02,876
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a very selfish, spiteful part of me that still hopes that there's one way we can get it, but it's back to looking.

1690
02:14:02,936 --> 02:14:04,697
[SPEAKER_09]: We may talk to a house flipper.

1691
02:14:05,838 --> 02:14:07,778
[SPEAKER_09]: So back to the hunt.

1692
02:14:08,899 --> 02:14:11,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Just ready to be done.

1693
02:14:11,919 --> 02:14:12,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready to be in a new place.

1694
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:18,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to my nerves because I'm pretty sure that my job is going to be awesome.

1695
02:14:19,041 --> 02:14:20,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody there was awesome.

1696
02:14:20,801 --> 02:14:22,702
[SPEAKER_09]: All the stuff that goes with it is awesome.

1697
02:14:23,642 --> 02:14:27,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just a little nervy because I don't want to fuck this up.

1698
02:14:27,382 --> 02:14:27,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1699
02:14:29,443 --> 02:14:29,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1700
02:14:31,451 --> 02:14:33,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, that's just F you guys.

1701
02:14:34,934 --> 02:14:37,975
[SPEAKER_11]: F you the fact that all my co-workers are gone.

1702
02:14:38,816 --> 02:14:42,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, all the co-workers that used to play games with us are gone.

1703
02:14:42,758 --> 02:14:44,660
[SPEAKER_11]: So now it's my boss and me.

1704
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:46,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And I kick his ass every day.

1705
02:14:47,441 --> 02:14:48,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Call of Duty.

1706
02:14:48,202 --> 02:14:48,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just like...

1707
02:14:51,801 --> 02:14:55,282
[SPEAKER_11]: And half the time he doesn't even want to play because he's got errands to run.

1708
02:14:56,082 --> 02:14:58,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Our other co-worker has errands to run.

1709
02:14:59,483 --> 02:15:01,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even take breaks anymore.

1710
02:15:04,284 --> 02:15:06,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Why bother walking over to the play game by myself?

1711
02:15:06,664 --> 02:15:07,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a law.

1712
02:15:07,944 --> 02:15:08,745
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to take a break.

1713
02:15:08,985 --> 02:15:10,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you hourly or salary?

1714
02:15:10,225 --> 02:15:10,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hourly.

1715
02:15:10,845 --> 02:15:11,705
[SPEAKER_02]: You're supposed to take a break.

1716
02:15:11,765 --> 02:15:12,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to.

1717
02:15:12,645 --> 02:15:15,366
[SPEAKER_02]: You're breaking the law.

1718
02:15:16,246 --> 02:15:19,267
[SPEAKER_09]: To quote the argument sketch from Money Python...

1719
02:15:20,908 --> 02:15:22,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be choosing to argue in my spare time.

1720
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:25,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1721
02:15:25,711 --> 02:15:37,700
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, there's no point in me walking over to the game room to try to play an Xbox Live game because our live connection is absolute shit and we get disconnected all the time.

1722
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:39,141
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because we're on 20 gigs.

1723
02:15:43,083 --> 02:16:05,409
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 gigs down for the whole company so it's like my internet running a hundred computers it's not gonna happen so that's it all right um let's see my fu of the week um one goes to stress and uh because stress will just drive people insane stressful

1724
02:16:06,169 --> 02:16:07,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck up your body.

1725
02:16:07,489 --> 02:16:08,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Stress sucks.

1726
02:16:08,890 --> 02:16:10,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to give an F you to stress.

1727
02:16:11,010 --> 02:16:17,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not necessarily me that's going through stress, but I just feel like the impact it has on other people, and it's never any fun.

1728
02:16:18,912 --> 02:16:27,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to also say an F you to the fact that Video Games Live was in San Francisco on Thursday and Friday, and I didn't go because I was so busy with so much other stuff going on this weekend.

1729
02:16:27,973 --> 02:16:28,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't go.

1730
02:16:29,414 --> 02:16:31,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of irritated at that.

1731
02:16:31,654 --> 02:16:34,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wanted to go, and it just wasn't going to work out for me this year.

1732
02:16:36,456 --> 02:16:37,877
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to give a thank you.

1733
02:16:38,537 --> 02:16:39,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a thank you.

1734
02:16:39,698 --> 02:16:41,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I give some thank you music here?

1735
02:16:41,419 --> 02:16:41,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1736
02:16:41,899 --> 02:16:44,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back to the hippy-dippy classic Game of the Week music here.

1737
02:16:44,941 --> 02:16:48,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a thank you to Brad from PodCulture.

1738
02:16:48,704 --> 02:16:50,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not only is he pretty much just an awesome guy.

1739
02:16:51,085 --> 02:16:54,708
[SPEAKER_04]: He's helped out Horde House and so forth, and you all should be listening to PodCulture.

1740
02:16:55,008 --> 02:16:59,951
[SPEAKER_04]: But he said here in chat, you never have to apologize for the tangents, serious or funny.

1741
02:17:00,352 --> 02:17:05,075
[SPEAKER_04]: They are a part of you guys and thus a part of gaming and why we tune in.

1742
02:17:05,715 --> 02:17:07,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So, shucks.

1743
02:17:08,676 --> 02:17:09,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a big smile.

1744
02:17:09,797 --> 02:17:11,377
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, many hearts.

1745
02:17:11,597 --> 02:17:12,197
[SPEAKER_04]: To all of you.

1746
02:17:12,698 --> 02:17:13,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to all of you.

1747
02:17:13,738 --> 02:17:20,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just Brad, but Brad needs to share his thanks with all you guys that tune in every week, be it live or podcast form.

1748
02:17:20,981 --> 02:17:21,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, shucks.

1749
02:17:21,801 --> 02:17:23,101
[SPEAKER_04]: You made it this far in the show.

1750
02:17:23,141 --> 02:17:23,762
[SPEAKER_04]: You're awesome.

1751
02:17:24,902 --> 02:17:25,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold star for you.

1752
02:17:27,063 --> 02:17:27,403
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1753
02:17:28,463 --> 02:17:29,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us move on, shall we?

1754
02:17:30,024 --> 02:17:30,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1755
02:17:31,471 --> 02:17:35,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so this is kind of interesting.

1756
02:17:35,712 --> 02:17:39,093
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a culmination of a lawsuit that's been in the works for a while.

1757
02:17:39,513 --> 02:17:53,476
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember the original creator of Madden was filing a lawsuit against EA for some royalties that were unpaid between 1990 and 1996.

1758
02:17:57,197 --> 02:17:59,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't they find out there were more monies due too?

1759
02:18:00,934 --> 02:18:04,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if this is the same situation, but apparently he got $11 million.

1760
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:10,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Great for him, I guess.

1761
02:18:11,092 --> 02:18:12,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, the Madden games are good for something.

1762
02:18:15,282 --> 02:18:22,352
[SPEAKER_11]: The jury found that the games released during that time were virtually identical to the original version of Madden NFL Football developed by Antonik.

1763
02:18:32,505 --> 02:18:47,969
[SPEAKER_11]: and basically saying that they, you know, I guess the Antony and his attorneys will seek to appeal previous rulings that exclude the Super Nintendo games and fraud claims from the jury deliberations.

1764
02:18:48,689 --> 02:18:52,030
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think they are still going to try to seek some more money.

1765
02:18:52,310 --> 02:18:57,131
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now, $11 million isn't nothing to shy away from.

1766
02:18:57,351 --> 02:18:58,992
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty cool.

1767
02:19:00,518 --> 02:19:00,978
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

1768
02:19:01,218 --> 02:19:04,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he can buy himself a new game studio for that amount of money.

1769
02:19:05,561 --> 02:19:08,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Atlas is on the table.

1770
02:19:08,842 --> 02:19:12,204
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1771
02:19:12,344 --> 02:19:15,126
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be able to pick up a Atari IP while you're at it.

1772
02:19:15,906 --> 02:19:17,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1773
02:19:17,687 --> 02:19:19,428
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really sad news, actually.

1774
02:19:19,508 --> 02:19:20,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of sucks.

1775
02:19:21,329 --> 02:19:23,371
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1776
02:19:43,729 --> 02:19:49,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning if you were looking forward to Darkstalkers 4, you'll be waiting a little bit longer.

1777
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:52,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all because you didn't support Darkstalkers Resurrection.

1778
02:19:52,205 --> 02:19:53,307
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically all your fault.

1779
02:19:54,192 --> 02:19:55,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm okay with that, to be honest.

1780
02:20:18,223 --> 02:20:26,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but okay, let's look at all the games that they've decided to put out again or make new versions of or something versus Mega Man.

1781
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:31,212
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had the Dungeons & Dragons arcade games.

1782
02:20:32,793 --> 02:20:33,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fight.

1783
02:20:34,934 --> 02:20:38,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fight's good, but... DuckTales.

1784
02:20:40,318 --> 02:20:40,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Strider.

1785
02:20:41,138 --> 02:20:41,819
[SPEAKER_11]: And the problem is?

1786
02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:45,321
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem is, I mean, DuckTales is all good and everything.

1787
02:20:45,361 --> 02:20:46,282
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not Mega Man.

1788
02:20:47,495 --> 02:20:48,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't we get a new Mega Man?

1789
02:20:48,956 --> 02:20:52,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I guess we got Mega Man 9 and 10, but we need more Mega Man.

1790
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:57,022
[SPEAKER_11]: You're still making Dead Rising games, and those aren't that great.

1791
02:20:57,222 --> 02:20:58,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Strider trumps it.

1792
02:21:01,125 --> 02:21:02,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no interest in a Strider game.

1793
02:21:03,787 --> 02:21:10,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, going to the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Actdeft says, No, no, fuck Strider.

1794
02:21:10,892 --> 02:21:12,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I want new Darkstalkers.

1795
02:21:12,614 --> 02:21:15,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And Blackwolf says, I want new games not based on old IP.

1796
02:21:16,317 --> 02:21:16,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Haters.

1797
02:21:17,577 --> 02:21:17,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1798
02:21:18,517 --> 02:21:24,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, ShadowNextGen says, and before I open up the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, all one word.

1799
02:21:24,999 --> 02:21:28,140
[SPEAKER_04]: ShadowNextGen says, there was some fairly big Activision news that is happening.

1800
02:21:28,180 --> 02:21:30,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised no one has mentioned it, at least not yet.

1801
02:21:30,621 --> 02:21:33,282
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it did mysteriously not make the show roll.

1802
02:21:33,322 --> 02:21:33,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess...

1803
02:21:34,222 --> 02:21:34,963
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1804
02:21:52,114 --> 02:21:54,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It means that... 8 billion.

1805
02:21:54,477 --> 02:21:55,999
[SPEAKER_04]: They paid 8 billion for themselves.

1806
02:21:56,079 --> 02:22:00,484
[SPEAKER_11]: They bought out the shares that Vividi owned.

1807
02:22:00,784 --> 02:22:02,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Vividi still owns part of it.

1808
02:22:02,746 --> 02:22:06,771
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 12% of the company versus, I guess, a controlling share or something.

1809
02:22:07,232 --> 02:22:07,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 50%.

1810
02:22:08,013 --> 02:22:10,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so they basically bought that stuff back.

1811
02:22:10,075 --> 02:22:10,776
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also another...

1812
02:22:11,977 --> 02:22:14,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks in the chat room are saying, Activision is now an independent company.

1813
02:22:14,258 --> 02:22:14,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1814
02:22:38,826 --> 02:22:40,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'd go that far

1815
02:22:57,094 --> 02:23:21,214
[SPEAKER_04]: but uh it it is it's it's more interesting to see what's going to develop from this i mean from a financial investing stock side it's it's fascinating but i'm waiting to see like what does change in policy come from this because the management's not going to change the ceo doesn't change this means they make more money at the end of the day because more that they don't have to answer to a greater board of directors that's the one thing that gets cut out we can raise the prices of the games like

1816
02:23:21,915 --> 02:23:22,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

1817
02:23:22,537 --> 02:23:27,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe make some big decisions to take World of Warcraft free to play or whatever they gotta do.

1818
02:23:27,567 --> 02:23:29,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So, be interesting.

1819
02:23:30,356 --> 02:23:30,576
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1820
02:23:30,896 --> 02:23:42,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you want to call in and talk about this, the Activision split, or anything else we've talked about this week on the show, or this week, yeah, this week, tonight on the show, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1821
02:23:42,526 --> 02:23:45,288
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to open those phones right now for you to call in.

1822
02:23:45,629 --> 02:23:49,552
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have anything you want to talk about at all, you can do that right now.

1823
02:23:50,933 --> 02:23:53,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, I will look for some last-minute stories.

1824
02:23:53,455 --> 02:23:55,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to Twitter as well, see if there's anything on there.

1825
02:23:55,917 --> 02:23:59,080
[SPEAKER_04]: But Loki, DarkSakura, either of you have some last-minute stories you want to share?

1826
02:23:59,660 --> 02:24:03,103
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, no, my voice decided to die.

1827
02:24:03,243 --> 02:24:03,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1828
02:24:04,024 --> 02:24:04,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1829
02:24:05,926 --> 02:24:08,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no, I don't really have anything right now.

1830
02:24:08,628 --> 02:24:09,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy moly.

1831
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:11,351
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a slow news week.

1832
02:24:11,651 --> 02:24:18,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little bit of a slow news week when all that drama about the indie game and all that kind of takes center stage.

1833
02:24:18,197 --> 02:24:19,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that kind of tells you what kind of week it was.

1834
02:24:20,379 --> 02:24:26,404
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, okay, there's a few things that the Twitter folks are sending us, so let me read some of these tweets real quick, and maybe some of you guys heard about these stories.

1835
02:24:26,885 --> 02:24:29,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, SSGO100Matt says, uh, there was some Punch-Out related news.

1836
02:24:30,088 --> 02:24:33,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Mike Tyson was caught by TMZ.

1837
02:24:33,811 --> 02:24:39,556
[SPEAKER_04]: You know TMZ is that really trashy tabloid site that, like, stalks celebrities at airports and asks them really stupid questions?

1838
02:24:39,976 --> 02:24:43,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Mike, apparently one of those guys at TMZ asked Mike Tyson...

1839
02:24:43,459 --> 02:24:46,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how far can you get in Mike Tyson's punch-out?

1840
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:47,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been able to beat yourself?

1841
02:24:48,161 --> 02:24:51,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said that he sucks at it, like he can't even get past the first guy.

1842
02:24:51,403 --> 02:24:53,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that's so stupid.

1843
02:24:53,784 --> 02:24:56,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Mike Tyson, what's your favorite brand of chips?

1844
02:24:57,346 --> 02:25:01,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, what kind of... It's like, what kind of ice cream are you like?

1845
02:25:01,448 --> 02:25:03,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that really what they're approaching?

1846
02:25:03,448 --> 02:25:06,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, Loki, I think I like the Ruffles chips, because I don't have ears.

1847
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:08,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that like what they really like?

1848
02:25:08,402 --> 02:25:10,724
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the worst impression by the way.

1849
02:25:11,044 --> 02:25:14,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that like what they're really doing to celebrities nowadays?

1850
02:25:14,247 --> 02:25:17,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Like stalking them to ask them really fucking stupid questions?

1851
02:25:17,150 --> 02:25:18,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you looked at TMZ?

1852
02:25:18,572 --> 02:25:19,032
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1853
02:25:19,152 --> 02:25:19,673
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awful.

1854
02:25:19,773 --> 02:25:20,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the cesspool.

1855
02:25:20,794 --> 02:25:21,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Never.

1856
02:25:21,094 --> 02:25:22,636
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the cesspool of the internet.

1857
02:25:22,916 --> 02:25:29,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if the Big Brother house is the cesspool of society, then TMZ is the pooper in that house.

1858
02:25:29,062 --> 02:25:30,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo, Mike, what do you think about the royal baby?

1859
02:25:31,264 --> 02:25:31,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1860
02:25:31,844 --> 02:25:34,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, look, we got a call.

1861
02:25:35,526 --> 02:25:36,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Slimes Radio.

1862
02:25:36,687 --> 02:25:37,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1863
02:25:37,767 --> 02:25:43,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want you to know I had to bite my tongue during that whole segment so I wouldn't bust out in full laughter.

1864
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:44,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you like my impression?

1865
02:25:45,791 --> 02:25:46,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

1866
02:25:47,052 --> 02:25:48,032
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just terrible, man.

1867
02:25:48,052 --> 02:25:49,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Just terrible.

1868
02:25:49,193 --> 02:25:49,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1869
02:25:49,953 --> 02:25:50,853
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1870
02:25:51,774 --> 02:25:52,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

1871
02:25:52,174 --> 02:25:56,176
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I want to say the advice that you gave earlier in the podcast...

1872
02:25:59,332 --> 02:25:59,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1873
02:25:59,972 --> 02:26:00,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1874
02:26:00,533 --> 02:26:01,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It means a lot.

1875
02:26:01,975 --> 02:26:04,419
[SPEAKER_10]: It does because I'm dealing with some similar issues.

1876
02:26:04,439 --> 02:26:10,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to tell you about that another time, but I truly understand somewhat where you're coming from with this and that.

1877
02:26:12,290 --> 02:26:14,613
[SPEAKER_10]: But I actually called in to let you know that

1878
02:26:15,703 --> 02:26:23,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually getting my replacement headset from Astro Gaming.

1879
02:26:25,286 --> 02:26:34,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Long story short, I was having issues with the mixer and the headset and it took them maybe about several months through various emails to try to get it fixed.

1880
02:26:34,668 --> 02:26:38,230
[SPEAKER_10]: The mixer got replaced, the mic got replaced, but not the headset.

1881
02:26:38,710 --> 02:26:40,391
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem still persisted.

1882
02:26:40,971 --> 02:26:50,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the clouds in the sky parted and the sun shone through and all these customer service issues are getting fixed this week because Loki's finally getting his damn controller, too, for the OUYA.

1883
02:26:50,375 --> 02:26:51,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, allegedly.

1884
02:26:51,295 --> 02:26:52,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, until that thing shows up.

1885
02:26:52,836 --> 02:26:59,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Except it's coming from DHL, so it'll be probably fired out of a cannon across the Pacific Ocean and hopefully land.

1886
02:26:59,159 --> 02:27:00,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta get my OUYA back for me this week.

1887
02:27:00,379 --> 02:27:01,960
[SPEAKER_10]: They're delivering by carrier pigeon.

1888
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:02,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

1889
02:27:03,521 --> 02:27:23,902
[SPEAKER_04]: that's because DHL packed it up and left they couldn't compete with FedEx and UPS they closed up several years ago it's just whatever's left well congratulations on getting what you needed from the company it's a good happy end to the story we hope

1890
02:27:24,721 --> 02:27:26,203
[SPEAKER_10]: It took two phone calls.

1891
02:27:26,443 --> 02:27:27,464
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy called me back.

1892
02:27:27,704 --> 02:27:29,005
[SPEAKER_10]: I explained everything.

1893
02:27:29,165 --> 02:27:35,030
[SPEAKER_10]: So they sent me a brand new 2013 kit and the appropriate cables for the new mixer.

1894
02:27:36,271 --> 02:27:45,378
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya in our chat room, sorry to go on a tangent here real quick, but says about the whole Mike Tyson impression I did earlier, Rob should really get into VA work after this OLR thing ends.

1895
02:27:45,698 --> 02:27:47,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, why do I have to wait for OLR to end?

1896
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:48,740
[SPEAKER_04]: You want OLR to end?

1897
02:27:48,841 --> 02:27:49,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

1898
02:27:49,501 --> 02:27:50,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Last show, everybody.

1899
02:27:50,582 --> 02:27:51,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1900
02:27:51,222 --> 02:27:51,323
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1901
02:27:52,403 --> 02:27:52,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

1902
02:27:53,063 --> 02:27:56,665
[SPEAKER_10]: That means Ook-chan gets started on OLR, the Flash animated series.

1903
02:27:57,665 --> 02:27:59,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does that have to be something we wait on?

1904
02:28:00,266 --> 02:28:01,046
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1905
02:28:01,386 --> 02:28:02,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I did used to want to be a voice actor.

1906
02:28:02,827 --> 02:28:03,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the VA thing?

1907
02:28:04,087 --> 02:28:06,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be so down with that.

1908
02:28:07,068 --> 02:28:08,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw me a script, people!

1909
02:28:08,209 --> 02:28:17,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not very good at pursuing that stuff on my own because I do have a day job and all that, but it would be a dream to be a cartoon character or something.

1910
02:28:17,454 --> 02:28:18,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So, absolutely.

1911
02:28:19,695 --> 02:28:22,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw an idea my way and I'd be happy to do it.

1912
02:28:22,917 --> 02:28:24,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's just a little cameo.

1913
02:28:24,738 --> 02:28:28,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if I have to play derpy hooves or whatever, I'll do it.

1914
02:28:32,022 --> 02:28:32,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1915
02:28:33,483 --> 02:28:34,584
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is going on with you, Rama?

1916
02:28:34,604 --> 02:28:35,184
[SPEAKER_04]: What else in gaming?

1917
02:28:35,204 --> 02:28:36,105
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been playing lately?

1918
02:28:37,929 --> 02:28:42,572
[SPEAKER_10]: You might get mad if I tell you the game I've been playing for the last several weeks.

1919
02:28:42,672 --> 02:28:43,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Try me.

1920
02:28:43,292 --> 02:28:44,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Sailor Moon S Fighting Game.

1921
02:28:45,193 --> 02:28:46,473
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1922
02:28:47,154 --> 02:28:48,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing Candy Crush Saga.

1923
02:28:49,055 --> 02:28:49,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1924
02:28:50,115 --> 02:28:53,657
[SPEAKER_04]: JudgingYou.com I'm judging you times two.

1925
02:28:53,797 --> 02:28:54,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, is that a site?

1926
02:28:54,617 --> 02:28:54,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1927
02:28:54,997 --> 02:28:58,039
[SPEAKER_10]: That's coming from people who play Warcraft and FFXI.

1928
02:28:58,439 --> 02:28:59,900
[SPEAKER_10]: For shame, good people.

1929
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:01,200
[SPEAKER_10]: For shame.

1930
02:29:01,441 --> 02:29:02,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, look.

1931
02:29:02,201 --> 02:29:03,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby told us to hang up on you.

1932
02:29:04,802 --> 02:29:07,323
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not gonna because we have some tolerance, but still.

1933
02:29:08,204 --> 02:29:08,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Judging.

1934
02:29:10,185 --> 02:29:14,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, somebody has judgingyou.com and it says it's currently under construction.

1935
02:29:15,067 --> 02:29:16,008
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a webpage from 2005.

1936
02:29:16,368 --> 02:29:19,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're judging you, judgingyou.com.

1937
02:29:19,610 --> 02:29:21,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm totally judging you, judgingyou.com.

1938
02:29:22,651 --> 02:29:23,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1939
02:29:25,613 --> 02:29:28,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Candy Crush Saga, what stage are you on in Candy Crush?

1940
02:29:28,234 --> 02:29:28,214
315.

1941
02:29:28,834 --> 02:29:29,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit!

1942
02:29:29,154 --> 02:29:32,616
[SPEAKER_04]: How much have you spent?

1943
02:29:35,091 --> 02:29:35,351
[SPEAKER_04]: None.

1944
02:29:35,371 --> 02:29:37,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, okay, I am kind of impressed.

1945
02:29:37,573 --> 02:29:38,655
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I blocked that today.

1946
02:29:38,855 --> 02:29:45,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those levels are pretty fucking impossible without buying power-ups, so applause to you, my friend.

1947
02:29:45,421 --> 02:29:51,207
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no applause, because I'll be the first one to admit that I cheated on half those levels, and you know what?

1948
02:29:51,727 --> 02:29:53,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Even with all the extra power-ups...

1949
02:29:54,212 --> 02:29:58,056
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1950
02:30:14,230 --> 02:30:15,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I play on my tablet.

1951
02:30:15,591 --> 02:30:22,256
[SPEAKER_10]: And believe it or not, even though it's an online game, there are ways to access the Facebook app through third-party applications.

1952
02:30:22,837 --> 02:30:23,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1953
02:30:23,557 --> 02:30:23,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1954
02:30:24,158 --> 02:30:24,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha, gotcha.

1955
02:30:25,579 --> 02:30:27,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well thanks for the call, Ranma.

1956
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:29,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let you go and try to get some more calls, okay?

1957
02:30:30,002 --> 02:30:30,482
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

1958
02:30:30,743 --> 02:30:31,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay fabulous, darling.

1959
02:30:31,983 --> 02:30:32,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I will, always.

1960
02:30:33,785 --> 02:30:34,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay black.

1961
02:30:35,746 --> 02:30:36,207
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it!

1962
02:30:36,567 --> 02:30:37,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye.

1963
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:47,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And for anyone that's been a long-running inside joke on the show, just to be clear, it's something that Dan started, which was hilarious.

1964
02:30:47,284 --> 02:30:48,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Because my husband's a douche.

1965
02:30:48,484 --> 02:30:52,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he didn't know what else to say in that moment, so it was just really funny when he said that.

1966
02:30:53,186 --> 02:30:53,747
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow.

1967
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:59,512
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says, I'm sad to report that Candy Crush Jam Session has been cancelled.

1968
02:31:01,113 --> 02:31:03,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't let poor Ranma plug Anime Jam Session.

1969
02:31:03,494 --> 02:31:04,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you should listen on Tuesday nights.

1970
02:31:05,575 --> 02:31:08,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go back to the phones.

1971
02:31:08,696 --> 02:31:12,678
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1972
02:31:13,438 --> 02:31:15,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I still have some more tweets for you guys.

1973
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:20,403
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt did have a second Punch Out tweet for us, and that is, A gaming did you know?

1974
02:31:20,943 --> 02:31:27,287
[SPEAKER_04]: The title theme to Punch Out came from Gillette's Cavalcade of Sports 1950 intro.

1975
02:31:27,707 --> 02:31:32,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bobby Black will follow that up with, it actually was one of Gillette's theme songs, very famous back then.

1976
02:31:32,770 --> 02:31:35,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Boston Pop's version, and a whole bunch of YouTubes were linked.

1977
02:31:36,273 --> 02:31:36,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1978
02:31:37,233 --> 02:31:38,814
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1979
02:32:03,747 --> 02:32:09,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched a video today of Left 4 Dead 2 mods that had Whitney Houston as a playable character.

1980
02:32:09,949 --> 02:32:10,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my, that's terrible.

1981
02:32:12,009 --> 02:32:12,709
[SPEAKER_04]: That's terrible.

1982
02:32:14,030 --> 02:32:16,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, just putting a shout out there for some phone calls.

1983
02:32:16,330 --> 02:32:19,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1984
02:32:19,671 --> 02:32:22,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, remember when we used to make the RIP names in WoW?

1985
02:32:23,314 --> 02:32:24,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I still have R.I.P.

1986
02:32:24,554 --> 02:32:26,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Betty White, just for the day.

1987
02:32:26,535 --> 02:32:28,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, again, guys.

1988
02:32:28,296 --> 02:32:28,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I had R.I.P.

1989
02:32:29,016 --> 02:32:29,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Whitney.

1990
02:32:29,616 --> 02:32:32,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that woman, and I don't want that to happen.

1991
02:32:32,417 --> 02:32:34,658
[SPEAKER_04]: But when it does, I'll be ready.

1992
02:32:35,118 --> 02:32:36,018
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I still had?

1993
02:32:36,518 --> 02:32:37,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Rebecca Black.

1994
02:32:38,259 --> 02:32:40,300
[SPEAKER_04]: She was, like, max level at one point.

1995
02:32:40,480 --> 02:32:41,260
[SPEAKER_09]: She's 85 right now.

1996
02:32:41,320 --> 02:32:41,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, no, she's 86.

1997
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:47,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you can always start Final Fantasy XIV and have Rebecca Black mage.

1998
02:32:49,393 --> 02:32:50,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually like that.

1999
02:32:50,333 --> 02:32:51,154
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really funny.

2000
02:32:51,174 --> 02:32:51,494
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2001
02:32:51,534 --> 02:32:52,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'll do that.

2002
02:32:52,815 --> 02:32:53,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Rebecca Black Mage.

2003
02:32:53,756 --> 02:32:56,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make like a human character in 14 and do Rebecca Black Mage.

2004
02:32:58,119 --> 02:32:58,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

2005
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:05,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to name my Final Fantasy 14 character because originally my little Taro Taro was named Lil Poundcake.

2006
02:33:06,803 --> 02:33:08,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, if you watch RuPaul's Drag Race, you'll understand why.

2007
02:33:09,384 --> 02:33:09,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was great.

2008
02:33:10,104 --> 02:33:16,247
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I think I'm going to have a character, a human, because Shane's convinced me I need to play a human.

2009
02:33:16,487 --> 02:33:20,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to name her Lisa Turtle, after one of my favorite Saved by the Bell characters.

2010
02:33:20,809 --> 02:33:22,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Lark Vujerys is a hot mess now.

2011
02:33:22,509 --> 02:33:23,570
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to know what's funny?

2012
02:33:23,970 --> 02:33:26,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that I've managed to get Homestuck names.

2013
02:33:26,651 --> 02:33:26,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah?

2014
02:33:27,111 --> 02:33:28,092
[SPEAKER_09]: On the busiest server.

2015
02:33:28,352 --> 02:33:28,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

2016
02:33:29,352 --> 02:33:30,193
[SPEAKER_09]: and no one else had them.

2017
02:33:30,393 --> 02:33:31,693
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like, heck yeah.

2018
02:33:31,793 --> 02:33:32,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck yeah.

2019
02:33:32,514 --> 02:33:33,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So is Skype working, y'all?

2020
02:33:33,854 --> 02:33:34,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Poke, poke.

2021
02:33:34,555 --> 02:33:37,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it a few more minutes, but if nobody else calls in, I guess we'll call it a show.

2022
02:33:38,317 --> 02:33:40,037
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a few tweets from Tigerclaw, however.

2023
02:33:40,518 --> 02:33:44,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney registers some Star Wars Attack Squadron domains.

2024
02:33:44,860 --> 02:33:45,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

2025
02:33:46,361 --> 02:33:47,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Possible announcement for later.

2026
02:33:47,981 --> 02:33:54,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And PlayStation 4 devs can only use 4.5 gigabytes of the system's 8 gigabyte RAM.

2027
02:33:55,525 --> 02:33:56,987
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2028
02:34:22,149 --> 02:34:27,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, the FCC report came out from PlayStation 4, I think even the Xbox One.

2029
02:34:27,733 --> 02:34:30,215
[SPEAKER_11]: We now know what the operating temperature is going to be.

2030
02:34:30,735 --> 02:34:35,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Who the fuck cares what the goddamn operating temperature of a console is going to be?

2031
02:34:36,138 --> 02:34:36,979
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes no sense.

2032
02:34:37,921 --> 02:34:38,601
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nothing.

2033
02:34:38,801 --> 02:34:42,523
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just another article they can get some fucking hits on their website for.

2034
02:34:45,964 --> 02:34:47,084
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ridiculous.

2035
02:34:48,645 --> 02:34:49,885
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know what the hell that means.

2036
02:34:50,006 --> 02:34:50,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it means anything.

2037
02:34:51,466 --> 02:34:51,786
[SPEAKER_11]: So what?

2038
02:34:52,466 --> 02:35:01,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I bet you anything with three fucking operating systems on the goddamn Xbox One, there's going to be a good chunk of that that's going to be dedicated to those.

2039
02:35:02,330 --> 02:35:07,413
[SPEAKER_11]: However, there was a rumor I saw that they're going to allow some of that for indie developers.

2040
02:35:07,453 --> 02:35:09,435
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think all that stuff is just being pulled out of someone's ass.

2041
02:35:09,475 --> 02:35:12,076
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, no one knows what the hell is going to happen.

2042
02:35:12,236 --> 02:35:17,059
[SPEAKER_11]: And it doesn't matter in the end of the day because there wasn't that much RAM on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

2043
02:35:17,460 --> 02:35:21,422
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, there's some pretty good games on those consoles.

2044
02:35:23,063 --> 02:35:23,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's a big deal.

2045
02:35:24,604 --> 02:35:26,025
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just play the games.

2046
02:35:26,085 --> 02:35:27,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Who gives a shit about the specs?

2047
02:35:27,346 --> 02:35:28,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Just play the games.

2048
02:35:28,146 --> 02:35:28,527
[SPEAKER_11]: They're good.

2049
02:35:28,727 --> 02:35:28,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

2050
02:35:30,411 --> 02:35:31,872
[SPEAKER_11]: How the magic's done, no one cares.

2051
02:35:32,112 --> 02:35:34,673
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we do have another call coming in, so let's go to it.

2052
02:35:34,713 --> 02:35:35,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2053
02:35:35,614 --> 02:35:35,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2054
02:35:36,754 --> 02:35:37,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Raging Eater.

2055
02:35:38,035 --> 02:35:38,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Raging Eater.

2056
02:35:38,655 --> 02:35:39,316
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2057
02:35:40,436 --> 02:35:41,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

2058
02:35:42,337 --> 02:35:50,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just thought I'd call in with two very quick topics just in case someone else wants to call in.

2059
02:35:51,102 --> 02:35:51,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

2060
02:35:52,522 --> 02:35:57,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, although the first talk is probably more appropriate for an anime jam session kind of thing.

2061
02:36:00,132 --> 02:36:03,693
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a series called Gunslinger Girl.

2062
02:36:08,694 --> 02:36:12,535
[SPEAKER_01]: For those that haven't heard of it, it's an anime series.

2063
02:36:12,635 --> 02:36:15,776
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two seasons long plus it has two OVAs.

2064
02:36:16,596 --> 02:36:21,697
[SPEAKER_01]: It basically centers around an agency in Italy that

2065
02:36:22,621 --> 02:36:25,163
[SPEAKER_01]: has like a social welfare front.

2066
02:36:25,203 --> 02:36:31,066
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really like a spy and CIA type of agency in reality.

2067
02:36:31,867 --> 02:36:33,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And it involves cyborgs.

2068
02:36:34,068 --> 02:36:39,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably not doing the series justice by describing it.

2069
02:36:40,792 --> 02:36:43,374
[SPEAKER_01]: But needless to say, it's a very excellent series.

2070
02:36:45,415 --> 02:36:50,178
[SPEAKER_01]: For those that haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a while,

2071
02:36:51,005 --> 02:36:56,612
[SPEAKER_01]: and you like anime or at least someone interested in anime, I suggest watching.

2072
02:36:57,172 --> 02:36:59,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, was there a question in there somewhere?

2073
02:36:59,876 --> 02:37:00,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, is that...

2074
02:37:03,992 --> 02:37:06,953
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much a question, but a recommendation.

2075
02:37:07,153 --> 02:37:08,114
[SPEAKER_04]: No, okay, it's all good.

2076
02:37:08,174 --> 02:37:09,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you said it was a question.

2077
02:37:09,674 --> 02:37:10,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'll just watch Dollhouse.

2078
02:37:11,135 --> 02:37:13,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, it sounds interesting.

2079
02:37:13,376 --> 02:37:14,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It was poor crazy on my part.

2080
02:37:14,616 --> 02:37:15,176
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's all right.

2081
02:37:15,476 --> 02:37:18,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't watch a lot of anime, but not that it's bad.

2082
02:37:18,397 --> 02:37:19,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't dislike it.

2083
02:37:19,418 --> 02:37:22,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hardly watch any TV at all because I'm always playing video games.

2084
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:26,400
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, but it sounds cool.

2085
02:37:27,721 --> 02:37:30,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll add that to my ever-growing list of shit to catch up on.

2086
02:37:33,253 --> 02:37:41,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's probably one of those series that is probably really great for those that don't watch a whole lot of anime.

2087
02:37:41,539 --> 02:37:46,022
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like an entry-level anime.

2088
02:37:46,723 --> 02:37:51,246
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the first series I watched, and I still love it.

2089
02:37:51,366 --> 02:37:54,269
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes me so incredibly sad to hear that.

2090
02:37:54,469 --> 02:37:55,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, it does.

2091
02:37:56,430 --> 02:37:56,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?

2092
02:37:57,870 --> 02:38:12,077
[SPEAKER_09]: because I remember my introductions to anime were classics like Ranma and Devil Hunter Yoko and then watching Robotech when I was a little kid and Voltron and all that.

2093
02:38:13,118 --> 02:38:23,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, I did see Robotech a few episodes of that when I was a kid but I really don't remember too much of it and I wasn't even sure if Voltron qualified as

2094
02:38:23,900 --> 02:38:24,581
[SPEAKER_01]: and me or not.

2095
02:38:24,601 --> 02:38:26,442
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, there was American Beauty.

2096
02:38:26,502 --> 02:38:27,362
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Matt Cross.

2097
02:38:27,442 --> 02:38:28,483
[SPEAKER_09]: It definitely qualifies.

2098
02:38:30,865 --> 02:38:32,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I stand corrected.

2099
02:38:32,046 --> 02:38:39,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, anyway, just to switch gears so I can hurry this call up to keep someone on the calls in.

2100
02:38:42,212 --> 02:38:53,160
[SPEAKER_01]: As you may or may not be aware, in case you haven't seen me on scheme, I've finally gotten into the Civ games and both 4 and 5

2101
02:38:54,285 --> 02:39:18,938
[SPEAKER_01]: and thanks to BlackWolf and I'm loving them and um I was thinking you know uh although I kind of brought up briefly the other day when you were doing the noob nights on uh Borderlands 2 one of these days we all should have like a VOG community night on set five maybe again like a pretty decent game going I don't know what the

2102
02:39:20,155 --> 02:39:23,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's eight.

2103
02:39:24,038 --> 02:39:24,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

2104
02:39:24,439 --> 02:39:25,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hold me on that.

2105
02:39:26,220 --> 02:39:27,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

2106
02:39:27,701 --> 02:39:27,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2107
02:39:28,081 --> 02:39:33,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I guess that's one of the games to play on Steam, from what I can tell, it's pretty popular.

2108
02:39:33,786 --> 02:39:35,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We should probably get like a

2109
02:39:36,287 --> 02:39:37,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Community Night going on, yeah.

2110
02:39:58,643 --> 02:40:02,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if there's noobs, the problem is one person can really hold up those games.

2111
02:40:03,246 --> 02:40:08,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody has to be well-versed enough in Civ to keep the game moving.

2112
02:40:08,348 --> 02:40:13,811
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be one thing for just Shane and I to play, because he hasn't played at all, so he has to learn.

2113
02:40:14,191 --> 02:40:16,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So that could kind of move at one pace.

2114
02:40:16,172 --> 02:40:21,655
[SPEAKER_04]: But if eight of us are going to play, we all need to be relatively familiar enough with the game to keep it moving.

2115
02:40:21,735 --> 02:40:26,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Because otherwise, we're going to need 120 hours to play that fucking game.

2116
02:40:26,874 --> 02:40:37,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll be first to admit that, you know, I'm not on the same expert level as, say, like you or... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2117
02:40:37,900 --> 02:40:38,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the car apart.

2118
02:40:39,161 --> 02:40:42,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, put the car apart, because I am by no means an expert at Civ.

2119
02:40:42,642 --> 02:40:44,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually quite bad at it.

2120
02:40:44,143 --> 02:40:47,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the strategical mind it takes to play a game like that.

2121
02:40:47,545 --> 02:40:54,749
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying, you don't have to necessarily be good, but you just have to be able to move relatively fast and not get yourself held up.

2122
02:40:56,285 --> 02:41:12,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I was going to say, I'm not as good as some of the other people within the VOG community, but ever since playing the game for the first time during that free weekend, I've certainly gotten a whole lot better.

2123
02:41:15,239 --> 02:41:22,744
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those that don't already have the game, either Civ IV or Civ V on Steam already,

2124
02:41:24,332 --> 02:41:26,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely recommend getting those games.

2125
02:41:26,493 --> 02:41:27,834
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really, really great.

2126
02:41:28,014 --> 02:41:33,257
[SPEAKER_04]: You missed the hell out during the Steam sale, to be honest, but hopefully it'll be on a Flash sale again in the coming weeks.

2127
02:41:33,537 --> 02:41:35,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hopefully.

2128
02:41:35,158 --> 02:41:36,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll let you go.

2129
02:41:36,939 --> 02:41:42,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you probably want to get more calls or wrap up the show, but it's been a blast talking to you.

2130
02:41:42,282 --> 02:41:43,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care, Spazinator.

2131
02:41:43,263 --> 02:41:43,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to hear from you.

2132
02:41:44,464 --> 02:41:45,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, nice talking to you, too.

2133
02:41:45,544 --> 02:41:45,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2134
02:41:48,163 --> 02:41:50,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I always appreciate an endorsement for Civ.

2135
02:41:50,084 --> 02:41:53,486
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2136
02:41:53,506 --> 02:41:55,707
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give it about one more minute, see if any other calls come in.

2137
02:41:56,508 --> 02:41:57,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I do all the tweets?

2138
02:41:57,528 --> 02:42:07,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I did the last one there, because that was from Tigerclaw, about the partial system RAM, and we were kind of talking about other systems and that whole thing.

2139
02:42:08,254 --> 02:42:08,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me.

2140
02:42:09,294 --> 02:42:10,295
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was it for tweets.

2141
02:42:11,235 --> 02:42:14,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to send us a tweet in a future week, twitter.com slash OLR.

2142
02:42:14,736 --> 02:42:20,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to send us an email for a future week, of course, that address is mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2143
02:42:21,757 --> 02:42:25,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not see the phone ringing here and we are out of last minute news, right?

2144
02:42:25,558 --> 02:42:28,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we got to close up shop.

2145
02:42:28,139 --> 02:42:28,379
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2146
02:42:28,399 --> 02:42:29,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and close.

2147
02:42:29,039 --> 02:42:31,160
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having big discussion on old school anime now.

2148
02:42:31,300 --> 02:42:31,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, are you?

2149
02:42:32,260 --> 02:42:33,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what?

2150
02:42:33,841 --> 02:42:36,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma just brought up Devil Hunter Yoko, which is one of my favorite old series.

2151
02:42:36,983 --> 02:42:41,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, it was good through the first three OAVs.

2152
02:42:42,487 --> 02:42:49,932
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have talk about the most depressing stuff like Dog of Flanders and watching certain episodes of Galaxy Express 3-9.

2153
02:42:50,852 --> 02:42:56,376
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going back to the 70s and the late 60s now for our references.

2154
02:42:56,476 --> 02:42:57,276
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty cool.

2155
02:42:57,296 --> 02:43:00,799
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have to say that one of my favorite of all time, 80s Dirty Pair.

2156
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:02,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Heck yeah.

2157
02:43:02,705 --> 02:43:03,886
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2158
02:43:03,926 --> 02:43:06,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess I'll close up the Skype line since nobody else was calling in.

2159
02:43:06,767 --> 02:43:08,187
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you to those that did call in.

2160
02:43:08,227 --> 02:43:13,850
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do want to comment on the show, mailbag at orange lingerie dot com or, of course, tweets and Facebook.

2161
02:43:14,510 --> 02:43:18,472
[SPEAKER_04]: As a reminder, we will be off next week since I will be out of town.

2162
02:43:19,352 --> 02:43:21,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and plus we just we haven't had a week off in a while.

2163
02:43:22,034 --> 02:43:23,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we want a frickin vacation.

2164
02:43:23,614 --> 02:43:27,456
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe Bobby is still here live, though, at the Voice Geeks Network.

2165
02:43:27,476 --> 02:43:32,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So please still tune in to support him and all the other shows that air on the network throughout the week.

2166
02:43:33,579 --> 02:43:34,720
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back in two weeks.

2167
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:39,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we wrap it up, I do want to say thank you as always for listening to our show and downloading the show.

2168
02:43:40,203 --> 02:43:41,824
[SPEAKER_04]: We do do this for free.

2169
02:43:41,864 --> 02:43:45,886
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't ask for your money unless, you know, there's like a charity event going on or something.

2170
02:43:46,607 --> 02:43:49,789
[SPEAKER_04]: But we just say, hey, tell a friend or two about the show.

2171
02:43:50,089 --> 02:43:53,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Help spread the word about our show and just help the family grow a little bit.

2172
02:43:54,252 --> 02:43:55,132
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we want.

2173
02:43:55,232 --> 02:43:56,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Help the Oil Army grow.

2174
02:43:56,913 --> 02:44:16,413
[SPEAKER_09]: um meanwhile let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts since we're closing up shop here um DarkSakura and your boa constrictor cozy what is your final thought today I'm almost done with this thing but we also have other good references to other stuff like Zenki Record of Lodoss War Record of Lodoss War by the way inspired one of my first D&D characters oh really yes

2175
02:44:18,195 --> 02:44:24,978
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought tonight is I had this Chex mix today that's called Honey Nut Sweet and Salty and it's delish.

2176
02:44:25,378 --> 02:44:27,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the Honey Nut Cheerios mix they used to sell.

2177
02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:28,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost the exact same thing.

2178
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:29,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool story, huh?

2179
02:44:30,361 --> 02:44:32,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your last minute thought tonight or final thought.

2180
02:44:32,622 --> 02:44:34,623
[SPEAKER_11]: I see Bobby's going back to play Saints Row 4.

2181
02:44:34,823 --> 02:44:35,164
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

2182
02:44:35,224 --> 02:44:38,385
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to go make my own Saints Row 4 with hookers and blackjack.

2183
02:44:38,945 --> 02:44:39,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe no blackjack.

2184
02:44:42,341 --> 02:44:44,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I'm pretty sure Saints Row 4 probably has hookers.

2185
02:44:44,703 --> 02:44:46,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's so much blackjack.

2186
02:44:46,084 --> 02:44:50,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still going to do your game programming thing on a smaller scale where you do a blackjack?

2187
02:44:50,246 --> 02:44:54,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you could still make slutty blackjack or slutty breakout.

2188
02:44:54,509 --> 02:44:55,890
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because there wasn't that much.

2189
02:44:56,030 --> 02:44:57,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say there was not really very...

2190
02:44:58,792 --> 02:44:59,713
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2191
02:45:21,750 --> 02:45:22,890
[SPEAKER_04]: You do you on that.

2192
02:45:23,030 --> 02:45:23,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's fine.

2193
02:45:23,570 --> 02:45:28,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to play Borderlands the other day anyway, so, you know, to level up.

2194
02:45:28,612 --> 02:45:30,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes there's just more important things like Borderlands.

2195
02:45:30,612 --> 02:45:32,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I had to level up so I can, you know, I can play with you guys.

2196
02:45:32,833 --> 02:45:33,613
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fair enough.

2197
02:45:33,993 --> 02:45:36,134
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2198
02:45:36,434 --> 02:45:37,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys very much for tuning in.

2199
02:45:37,814 --> 02:45:40,595
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be back in two weeks with episode number 515.

2200
02:45:40,775 --> 02:45:43,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I will see some of you next week at GamerX.

2201
02:45:44,396 --> 02:45:46,976
