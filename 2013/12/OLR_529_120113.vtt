00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
We're officially on the road to the holiday season and the lovable 3rd Street Saints are joining in the festivities with new DLC.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Also tonight, GamerX founder Matt Kahn joins us to talk about his Kickstarter for a Snatcher inspired adventure game.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Your questions, comments, calls on the show where every video gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
I just said that.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
I know you did and I'm saying it again. Live on this December 1st, 2013, episode number 529.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
Welcome to the show. We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gamer lulls, and who knows what else with my co-hosts, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Does that mean he said it dead and now he's undead?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
He said it out of turn is what he said. Fired!

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
It's fine. Alright.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Blah.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
DarkSakura, we missed you last week. Welcome back.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
I wish I was here last week because it was fucking loud.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
We went to this place called the Yard House which we were discussing before.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Not like super fancy pants but a little fancy.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I ate something incredibly non-kosher and it was delicious.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
It was a surf and turf burger without the bun.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Well then happy Hanukkah, Jamie.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Happy Hanukkah to me!

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
It is the fifth night. I will be lighting my candles when I return home.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
How did Hanukkah's giving, Hanukkah's giving or whatever?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Thanksgivica.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Thanksgivica, yeah. So how did Thanksgivica treat you?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
It was fucking loud too.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay, well we went to have Thanksgiving dinner at, you remember Dan's buddy Adam, right?

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
We went over there and there were the kids and Dan's cousins and brought the kids too and there was a bunch of little people and fucking sports ball.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I hate sports ball.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
I hate sports ball.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Unless it's DVR.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
And I say it with extra, extra southern accent because all I heard about yesterday was Alabama Auburn, no one cur.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
But you do love Tecmo Bowl, right?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, I guess.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I thought there was some, there's some sports ball you can tolerate, I know that.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah, some.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I used to date a rugby player and that was pretty awesome.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Alright, also say hello as well to, Loki is here in studio.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Hi.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
How you doing Techmaster Loki?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Doing fine.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm trying to figure out where these phantom stain spots came from.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
It looks like something dripped on my hand.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Pizza sauce.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
It's not pizza sauce.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
It's grease.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Well it must be for the breadsticks but they're not that greasy.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I mean they are greasy but they're not that greasy.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Like I didn't notice any grease dripping off of them.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
So one of Loki's, you know Loki always brings an interesting dining selection to the show and you know it's sometimes fast.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
It's become a bit of a betting game amongst the live OLR listeners what he brings to the show.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
So tonight he brought his, he goes to the pizza place, he doesn't get pizza he gets just a mass of breadsticks.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
They are really good breadsticks so I will say.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
If you have round table pizza in your area and you've had the breadsticks they are really good.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I'm not gonna lie.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
But yeah it's probably oil or something.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Anyway.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
It's cheese.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Cheese or something.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
It's cheesy.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It keeps Loki cheesy y'all.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Alright.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
It's not easy.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
It's being cheesy.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I know you heard him a minute ago and he is back this week.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Say hello to the voice of the show.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Jason.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
It's me.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Again.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yet again.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah how you doing Jason?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Doing good.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Been a good couple of days.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Been a good four day weekend.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Did you have a good Thanksgiving as well?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
I did Friendsgiving.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Co-workers of mine invited me over and there was about 20 of us.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
Anybody that follows me on Twitter may have seen this story that I started to come up with.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
A Twitter, Apple, Google, and GitHub employee sat around the table and I don't really have

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
a joke to fill in to the end of that but I'm sure there's one in there somewhere.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Some Silicon Valley wag.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Friendsgiving is a lot of fun.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Friendsgiving is very good.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah it was a good time.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I had kind of a late Friends- well not- you know what I did last night?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I went and saw a grandpa from Hoard House.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
If you know my other show Hoard House that I do about all things sound like gaming but

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
never too seriously Wednesdays.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
I went and hung out with grandpa last night in what I think is becoming a bit of a post-Thanksgiving

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
tradition for us where we go, we visit, and then we go out and drink.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
So I'm-

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I heard you.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Got super drunk.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.560
I'm a little- well you must read my Twitter because I wrote some really stupid stuff last

04:13.560 --> 04:14.560
night while I-

04:14.560 --> 04:15.560
No, no, no, no.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.560
Grandpa posted it on Facebook.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.000
Okay, well you know me and my alcohol tolerance of which I have none, right?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Because I usually don't drink.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.700
I'm usually the sober one but visiting grandpa in the city we were able to take cabs and

04:25.700 --> 04:27.200
all that stuff.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.500
I had seven drinks last night.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.220
And yeah, it was a lot of fun.

04:33.220 --> 04:34.220
I'm good.

04:34.220 --> 04:35.220
I'm good.

04:35.220 --> 04:39.000
But I am feeling a little bit like if I'm dragging a little bit today, I blame that.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.500
I blame Friendsgiving with drinks.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.500
Good times.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.500
All right.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.500
Is that the new Zynga game?

04:45.500 --> 04:46.500
Friendsgiving with drinks?

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
Possibly.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
Possibly.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.500
All right.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.500
We have a busy show tonight.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.820
We have a lot of news to get into as well.

04:51.820 --> 04:57.140
Also joining us a little later on in the show in about 20 minutes, the founder of a convention

04:57.140 --> 05:02.180
I talked a lot about here on Orange Launch Radio because I went and I helped out with

05:02.180 --> 05:04.420
a panel there, GamerX.

05:04.420 --> 05:08.140
Matt Kahn is the founder of GamerX and he is actually going to be on the show tonight

05:08.140 --> 05:13.260
in about 20 minutes to talk about a new Kickstarter that actually has nothing to do with conventions

05:13.260 --> 05:18.700
but it is kind of neat because it's inspired by an old, you know, we love old classic video

05:18.700 --> 05:20.300
games here at OLR.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.940
How many, show of hands, who remembers the old video game Snatcher?

05:23.940 --> 05:24.940
Yep.

05:24.940 --> 05:26.500
Almost every hand in the room went up.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.060
Who has Snatcher?

05:28.060 --> 05:36.860
Well, Matt's latest Kickstarter for his company MidBoss Games is a game that's about a futuristic

05:36.860 --> 05:39.780
San Francisco that is heavily inspired by Snatcher.

05:39.780 --> 05:42.940
So he's going to come on, talk a little bit about that and of course, if he's going to

05:42.940 --> 05:44.980
be, I have to ask him about GamerX.

05:44.980 --> 05:46.620
I want to know about GamerX too.

05:46.620 --> 05:48.500
So we got to ask some of those questions.

05:48.500 --> 05:53.760
So we will get to those questions and your questions live in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

05:53.760 --> 05:56.060
in about 20 minutes or so.

05:56.060 --> 05:59.580
But first, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that, but I do want to get to a kickoff

05:59.580 --> 06:01.620
topic as well.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.940
This one's a little bit more of a serious note.

06:03.940 --> 06:08.200
This is housekeeping of sorts, IDK, what you want to call it, but we got to talk a little

06:08.200 --> 06:11.700
bit about last week.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.060
I thought we had a great show last week.

06:13.060 --> 06:14.660
We had a lot of fun here on the show last week.

06:14.660 --> 06:15.660
Even though you weren't here.

06:15.660 --> 06:16.660
I wasn't here.

06:16.660 --> 06:17.660
How could it be awesome?

06:17.660 --> 06:18.660
Well, it wasn't our best ever.

06:18.660 --> 06:19.660
I'll be honest.

06:19.660 --> 06:20.660
Dark Soccer.

06:20.660 --> 06:21.660
It could have been our best.

06:21.660 --> 06:22.820
You need me to balance it out, huh?

06:22.820 --> 06:23.820
But we did know.

06:23.820 --> 06:30.020
We did get feedback from multiple sources on last week's show that maybe felt that some

06:30.020 --> 06:33.340
of the discussion we had last week might have been a little bit off.

06:33.340 --> 06:36.420
And so it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

06:36.420 --> 06:39.900
So I want to entertain some of this feedback and I want to kind of respond to it a little

06:39.900 --> 06:43.380
bit respectfully.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.700
I'm going to call this one out because it was publicly posted to our Facebook.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.860
And by calling out, I just mean I'm selecting it to read it on there.

06:48.860 --> 06:51.740
Not like, I'm calling you out, black racks, three o'clock.

06:51.740 --> 06:52.740
No.

06:52.740 --> 06:53.740
Because I do appreciate the feedback.

06:53.740 --> 06:54.740
It's a show where every gamer has a voice.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.500
So I want to read this post that came to our Facebook.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.880
It's from Carla O is the name on Facebook.

06:58.880 --> 07:03.620
And it says, I think I might stop listening to the show if it becomes PlayStation centric,

07:03.620 --> 07:05.940
which it's starting to seem that way.

07:05.940 --> 07:07.420
And that was the comment.

07:07.420 --> 07:12.940
I was really trying to think like, what in last week's show might have given the impression

07:12.940 --> 07:14.220
that we were PlayStation centric?

07:14.220 --> 07:17.560
And I was really thinking about it and I was like, you know what?

07:17.560 --> 07:23.660
In gaming culture as of late anyway, things have definitely seemed to be tilting in PlayStation

07:23.660 --> 07:24.660
's favor as a whole.

07:24.660 --> 07:28.820
And I'm like, I'm looking at the big picture here and I'm trying to think, why is that?

07:28.820 --> 07:34.540
Well, that's because Microsoft has been playing a little bit of a game of catch up PR, fixed

07:34.540 --> 07:37.860
mistakes ever since E3, right?

07:37.860 --> 07:40.140
And obviously they launched the Xbox one.

07:40.140 --> 07:42.100
We kicked off last week's show.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.980
Loki had some choice words for the Xbox one.

07:44.980 --> 07:48.100
I felt what Loki was saying and even kind of listening back to it.

07:48.100 --> 07:52.120
I didn't think it was anything that I haven't like seen in other internet places.

07:52.120 --> 07:57.640
I think their voices I'm hearing other places, you know, again, every gamer has a voice.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.480
These are what some gamer voices are saying.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.720
Not everything out there is positive, but I was trying to think, does that, was that

08:02.720 --> 08:04.480
really making us PlayStation centric?

08:04.480 --> 08:05.480
I'm not sure.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.480
So I did respond.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.800
Nobody am on Sony's payroll now.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
Stop.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.800
No, you're not.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.800
All right.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.440
But I did respond and I gave an answer basically similar to what I'm telling you guys now.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.420
We try to treat everything fairly.

08:15.420 --> 08:18.560
And one thing I did point out, as I said, I know you probably haven't been listening

08:18.560 --> 08:21.600
to this show, but if you go back to like 2006.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.320
And this is definitely a way I kind of feel in general.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.280
If we go back to 2006, the roles were almost reversed.

08:28.280 --> 08:33.600
I mean, coming out of E3 that year, Sony was the laughing stock of the entire gaming industry.

08:33.600 --> 08:39.760
Giant enemy crabs, 599 US dollars, 599, like we all remember that, right?

08:39.760 --> 08:43.440
And I know I've made this comparison on the show before is that we're almost sitting in

08:43.440 --> 08:47.580
a place now where we're looking at like the complete flip of that.

08:47.580 --> 08:51.480
Microsoft had one of those E3s this year that they've been trying to recover from and

08:51.480 --> 08:52.720
PlayStation.

08:52.720 --> 08:56.920
You know, we had something very interesting happen at E3 this year.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.320
Let's think back, you guys.

08:58.320 --> 09:03.080
This is something we have not seen in a long time in this industry, ever since the ads

09:03.080 --> 09:06.120
in the magazines that say Sega does what Nintendo don't.

09:06.120 --> 09:11.120
We did not see something of the caliber of Jack Trenton getting up on stage and saying,

09:11.120 --> 09:16.960
we believe that gamers should be able to, sorry, I forget his direct quote, but we believe

09:16.960 --> 09:20.720
the gamers should be able to, once they buy the disc, the purchase is there.

09:20.720 --> 09:26.160
Once he did that systematic dismantling at E3 of everything the internet didn't like

09:26.160 --> 09:28.560
about Microsoft.

09:28.560 --> 09:33.920
And so that was an attack we haven't seen the likes of in a long time.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.340
So that made things very interesting.

09:36.340 --> 09:37.340
But anyway.

09:37.340 --> 09:38.340
We don't even have to go back that far.

09:38.340 --> 09:42.040
We just have to go back two weeks ago where you canceled your PS4 pre-order.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.540
True.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.080
But I don't necessarily blame Sony for that.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.240
I just necessarily blame it.

09:48.240 --> 09:52.520
And I think this is the boat we're all in right now of, we're just not ready for this

09:52.520 --> 09:53.960
next generation of game yet.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.000
And it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.480
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

09:58.480 --> 10:03.120
And for me personally, I look at what the PlayStation 4 has and at what the Xbox One

10:03.120 --> 10:05.960
has and I say, eh, nothing there for me yet.

10:05.960 --> 10:10.080
Well, Dan and I swore off system and phone launches.

10:10.080 --> 10:14.960
You know, I'm getting my 5S at the end of the year instead of, you know, right when

10:14.960 --> 10:20.500
it came out, we're getting our, probably getting our PS4 in February.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.800
And we've pretty much decided that just because more stuff that we want to do is out on it

10:23.800 --> 10:25.800
and it fits in better with the things that we want to do.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.800
End of story.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.800
Right.

10:27.800 --> 10:28.800
To tell you what train that I'm on.

10:28.800 --> 10:34.680
I'm on the Turbo Duo train, 16 bit forever, HuCards, heck yeah.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.720
So anyway, I wrote kind of a response along those lines.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.800
Karla wrote back and I do want to read this here.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.660
It says, but most of the negative criticism is focused on two out of those consoles.

10:43.660 --> 10:47.180
I can understand everyone has their favorite console, but if the show focuses on all gaming

10:47.180 --> 10:50.140
platforms, it should reflect that in the show content.

10:50.140 --> 10:53.660
Lately there has been a ton of negativity thrown at one console and that is pretty much

10:53.660 --> 10:55.300
what I hear in every other podcast.

10:55.300 --> 10:59.520
OLR was the exception, but not as of late, which makes me sad because I enjoy this show

10:59.520 --> 11:00.520
more than most.

11:00.520 --> 11:01.520
Thanks for the reply.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.520
And you know what?

11:02.520 --> 11:04.060
Thank you for engaging in respectful dialogue.

11:04.060 --> 11:08.080
I really love these types of conversations as opposed to what you used to see in the

11:08.080 --> 11:09.740
old YouTube comments.

11:09.740 --> 11:12.200
Fuck you, you fucking fuck, right?

11:12.200 --> 11:16.420
So I really appreciate kind of the respectful dialogue there.

11:16.420 --> 11:22.020
As far as it goes, I can see where maybe last week, maybe kicking the Xbox the day after

11:22.020 --> 11:27.400
they launched maybe wasn't the most tactful thing to do, but it's also kind of a realist

11:27.400 --> 11:29.880
view of where some people's heads are at.

11:29.880 --> 11:33.160
And I say this in general, and I'm going to come back to this theme a little bit later

11:33.160 --> 11:34.160
on tonight.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.460
I do like to think that we are fair to everybody.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.440
There's going to be good days for gaming companies.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.700
There's going to be bad days for gaming companies.

11:41.700 --> 11:45.660
And we're part of that voice out there on the internet that talks about that.

11:45.660 --> 11:48.020
And you know, just like, let's take Nintendo for an example.

11:48.020 --> 11:49.020
We've talked a lot of Sony.

11:49.020 --> 11:50.020
We've talked a lot of Microsoft.

11:50.020 --> 11:51.020
We haven't talked a lot of Nintendo.

11:51.020 --> 11:53.300
Nintendo absolutely has had their good days and their bad days.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.820
And we've talked about, you know, we try to razz them both on this show.

11:55.820 --> 12:01.260
For example, bad days, the swap note disabling, what?

12:01.260 --> 12:03.620
That was, you know, and that, that just feeds into the whole Nintendo.

12:03.620 --> 12:06.140
You do not understand online, that whole thing, right?

12:06.140 --> 12:11.300
But then on the good side of Nintendo, dude, Nintendo released two game of the year contenders

12:11.300 --> 12:15.980
on the same day in the new Mario 3D world and Zelda link between worlds.

12:15.980 --> 12:16.980
That's a very good thing.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.460
I mean, those are game of the year contenders.

12:18.460 --> 12:21.900
Granted, it's going to be a rough ride to the top when you've got Bioshock Infinite

12:21.900 --> 12:27.060
and Last of Us also this year, but let's not neglect that those are two rock solid games

12:27.060 --> 12:28.380
that came out on the same day.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.380
That's good news.

12:29.380 --> 12:35.020
So, you know, and I could, I could think of cases for Sony and Microsoft as well.

12:35.020 --> 12:40.180
I do want to encourage the listeners, you know, continue to, if you feel like your voice

12:40.180 --> 12:43.220
is not being represented, by all means, speak up.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.560
We want to hear where you're coming from.

12:44.560 --> 12:49.620
If you think that, um, you know, maybe we're neglecting something about the Xbox one that

12:49.620 --> 12:53.160
needs to be brought to the forelight, please bring it up on the show.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.340
You know, I don't think we've ever said to somebody, you know what, you're wrong in your

12:57.340 --> 12:58.340
opinion.

12:58.340 --> 13:01.100
I like to think we haven't said that, you know, maybe, maybe we sometimes riff on each

13:01.100 --> 13:04.260
other and yell at each other a little bit, maybe have said that, but we don't, you know,

13:04.260 --> 13:06.300
we don't really want to tell people they're wrong.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.300
Right.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.300
Am I right?

13:08.300 --> 13:09.300
Oh yeah.

13:09.420 --> 13:15.900
I've been meaning to talk to you about Mass Effect, but you're wrong.

13:15.900 --> 13:16.900
You're wrong.

13:16.900 --> 13:17.900
You're wrong.

13:17.900 --> 13:18.900
You can't deny a fact.

13:18.900 --> 13:19.900
You are wrong on.

13:19.900 --> 13:20.900
You cannot deny a fact.

13:20.900 --> 13:21.900
All right.

13:21.900 --> 13:25.860
But anyway, uh, I, I might be dragging this out way too much, but I just, I just want

13:25.860 --> 13:31.000
to say, guys, again, we're here to present some other perspectives and sometimes that's

13:31.000 --> 13:32.660
our perspective and sometimes that's your perspective.

13:32.660 --> 13:35.420
And one thing I want to challenge our listeners to do, I don't think I got my thought out

13:35.420 --> 13:42.940
on this, is that, you know, sometimes in gaming we tend to live in this bubble and it's the

13:42.940 --> 13:46.740
way, the way you see it and the things, and I'm not saying this particular listener is

13:46.740 --> 13:47.740
that way.

13:47.740 --> 13:51.900
I'm not saying you, I'm just saying in general, gamers, gaming, look at comments on websites

13:51.900 --> 13:54.020
and tell me you don't think this about some people.

13:54.020 --> 13:59.160
Some gamers tend to live in their little bubble and they can't really see outside that bubble.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.080
How could somebody possibly want an Xbox one?

14:02.080 --> 14:06.000
How could somebody possibly want to spend a hundred extra dollars on this system with

14:06.000 --> 14:10.760
this device you don't need and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, well, look outside that

14:10.760 --> 14:11.760
bubble.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.080
Maybe there's a reason.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.080
Maybe there's that game.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.780
And I'll tell you for me personally, next year is going to suck for my wallet because

14:17.780 --> 14:22.360
I'm going to have to buckle and get a PlayStation 4 when they release Final Fantasy 14, the

14:22.360 --> 14:26.400
Elder Scrolls beta, uh, the new infamous looks really good.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.680
You know, there's a lot of stuff on PlayStation then on Xbox 360, guess what?

14:29.680 --> 14:34.000
When they release a new halo, when they release quantum break, I got to pick up an, did I

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
say 360?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
I'm an Xbox one.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.840
When they release all that, I got to get an Xbox one as well.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.200
So my wallet's going to be hurting next year.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.640
I'm just waiting for those games.

14:41.640 --> 14:42.640
All right.

14:42.640 --> 14:49.340
Um, I do want to introduce our chat room live.vognetwork.com, uh, because we do tape live, of course, every

14:49.340 --> 14:52.840
Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network

14:52.840 --> 14:56.400
www.vognetwork.com.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.680
And I'm trying to look at, uh, what some of the chatters are saying here.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.520
We've been discussing physics.

15:03.520 --> 15:09.080
So on, on task, apparently I'm, I'm seeing you talk about gigantic monitors and whatever

15:09.080 --> 15:14.400
is going on there, because I said that I should be on NEC's payroll and someone asked if they

15:14.400 --> 15:15.400
still exist.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.480
And then we started talking about their printers and stuff, right?

15:18.480 --> 15:23.400
But they, they made like these great flat panel, not flat panel, but flat screen CRT

15:23.400 --> 15:27.040
monitors that were perfect for doing color matching.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.240
I mean, it was almost like a print match.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.240
It was so great.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.120
And of course you can't really get a CRT monitor anymore.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.600
Um, let's see.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.600
S2 100.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.720
Matt says, I remember the beginning of last generation, OLR was accused of being anti

15:38.720 --> 15:39.720
Sony.

15:39.720 --> 15:43.440
Well, a lot of internet was, uh, Brad says, uh, talk about what you know, we bought the

15:43.440 --> 15:45.420
PlayStation four versus the Xbox one.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.520
So that is what we can talk about.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.520
And you're right.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.640
We can talk about our particular reasons and so forth.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.680
And then let's see some folks in chat, uh, some various people talking about kind of

15:54.680 --> 15:57.720
the whole Microsoft and what happened recently with some of the bands they were doing, which

15:57.720 --> 15:59.960
we're going to get into a little later in the show.

15:59.960 --> 16:05.480
Um, Loki, I, I, you know, again, you don't have to apologize by any means for what you

16:05.480 --> 16:09.520
said last week, because I got to admit, I think you brought up some points that, you

16:09.520 --> 16:13.560
know, are worth thinking about and why there is some resistance to the Xbox one, but now

16:13.560 --> 16:18.480
they've had a week to kind of simmer on it and black Friday going on and so forth.

16:18.520 --> 16:23.720
Where's your head at now with generally PlayStation four and Xbox one and all of this, I gotta

16:23.720 --> 16:28.320
say that sweet, sweet PlayStation four is a great value for this holiday at a retail

16:28.320 --> 16:30.360
price of $399.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.360
You can find it.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.360
Okay.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.560
I just don't want to do that because I'm not on their payroll.

16:35.560 --> 16:41.560
I really wish I was, you don't understand how much that would be so awesome to have

16:41.560 --> 16:47.320
actual a, um, no, but, um, how do I see it?

16:47.760 --> 16:53.760
My point last week was, and I guess it just didn't come through clearly enough, so I will

16:53.760 --> 17:01.400
speak more clearly on it, um, that I thought Microsoft should have addressed the way their,

17:01.400 --> 17:04.200
you know, defective systems were, um, differently.

17:04.200 --> 17:09.160
And sure enough, a few days later, they finally came around and did it correctly.

17:09.160 --> 17:13.880
Like I said, address the situation, resolve it with your customers, you know, instead

17:13.880 --> 17:19.440
of letting them speculate about what the problem is or how wide of an issue it is and

17:19.440 --> 17:20.560
stuff like that.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.920
That was my issue.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.280
They cleared it up.

17:23.280 --> 17:28.640
So I'm, you want gaming companies to stop the smokescreen like, yeah, if you don't say

17:28.640 --> 17:30.320
anything, people are going to expect the worst.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.160
So that's kind of what it is.

17:32.160 --> 17:37.320
You know that Microsoft did it at the beginning of the Xbox, you know, three 16 launch kept

17:37.320 --> 17:41.760
playing down, you know, how many systems were affected by the red ring of death or whatever.

17:41.760 --> 17:45.360
And, um, you know, and people didn't believe them.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.360
Yeah.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.360
I don't believe you that a small percentage of them are being affected by it when I've

17:49.360 --> 17:53.360
had six, you know, it's just, it was ridiculous.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.640
So I don't know, I think I'm a hard on everybody.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.240
And if I'm not, then I need to try harder.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.240
You are to be fair.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.240
You are pretty hard on everybody.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.880
Uh, when, when, you know, shut up.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.880
But you know, I, it is kind of part of the reason I also see, you know, granted, we had

18:08.880 --> 18:11.720
a lot of feedback to last week's show in that regard, but I also get other feedback.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.740
That's like, I live for Loki rants.

18:14.740 --> 18:16.360
I am here for Loki rants.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.440
What pissed Loki off this week?

18:17.440 --> 18:18.740
I've got to have a rant.

18:18.740 --> 18:21.040
So, you know, there's, there's that on both sides.

18:21.040 --> 18:25.520
There's been things, we'll, we'll see what we're going to get to tonight in tonight's

18:25.520 --> 18:26.520
show.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.520
But, um, again, I just wanted to respond.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.200
And even though I only read one comment there, cause it was something public on Facebook.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.520
I just wanted to say there was other like chatter.

18:32.520 --> 18:36.480
So you know, I hope, you know, again, if you feel like there's a point that wasn't addressed,

18:36.480 --> 18:39.240
please by all means, email the show mailbag at orange dontre.com.

18:39.240 --> 18:42.360
You can post on Facebook as to, uh, Twitter and all that.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.180
Um, let's get into quickly.

18:44.180 --> 18:45.960
We're going to have Matt on in about 10 minutes.

18:45.960 --> 18:49.960
So we have a little bit of time to do some of our gaming weeks, at least, uh, dark soccer.

18:49.960 --> 18:50.960
You were out last week.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.160
What have you been gaming on the past couple of weeks?

18:53.160 --> 18:56.560
Uh, Final Fantasy 14, which every time I've logged on, no one's been on.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.560
So whatever.

18:57.560 --> 19:03.120
Um, and, uh, I really, cause I'm on a lot well, it's during the day and you people have

19:03.120 --> 19:04.120
jobs.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.120
Yeah.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.600
I started my job, my contract work.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.600
So I'm very happy.

19:08.600 --> 19:13.520
Um, yeah, I, uh, I bought, okay, actually, actually this is going to be a story, so maybe

19:13.520 --> 19:16.320
this will take the 10 minutes.

19:16.320 --> 19:19.960
Dan's birthday was Friday on black Friday and we were like last week we need to do something

19:19.960 --> 19:20.960
really nice for Dan.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.360
So I was trying to get people who wanted to get in to buy Dan a present with me and he

19:24.360 --> 19:27.600
had said up and down, I don't want a download copy of Zelda.

19:27.600 --> 19:32.320
I want the physical copy, so I'm not going to get the package, blah, blah, blah.

19:32.320 --> 19:40.520
So me and Becky and our cousin-in-law Hannah and George and Amanda all got together and

19:40.520 --> 19:47.240
we got the money together to order Dan a red, uh, 3DS XL and I bought him Zelda.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.240
I went out and bought it.

19:49.240 --> 19:53.600
Turns out while I'm sitting in the bank trying to get my, my, uh, business bank account set

19:53.600 --> 20:00.480
up so that, you know, it can work, Dan says, look what I bought, picture gold, you know,

20:00.480 --> 20:01.480
3DS.

20:01.480 --> 20:04.280
So I call him, I go, you are so stupid.

20:04.280 --> 20:07.920
And this guy is like sitting next to me playing like bejeweled on his phone and he's laughing

20:07.920 --> 20:14.960
his ass off because, and so anyway, it ended up, you know, they just gave the monies for

20:14.960 --> 20:18.800
Dan to pay back what he paid on the thing and we kept the physical copy.

20:18.800 --> 20:24.000
He gave the e-copy to George and maybe you were going to do something where you bought

20:24.000 --> 20:27.480
the Zelda one and then like you sold the code to somebody else who really wanted it.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.320
So I just kind of thought that's how things would go, but I, I liked the way you guys

20:30.320 --> 20:31.320
did it.

20:31.320 --> 20:35.240
And for the record bones, it actually was me because I was using Becky me in a subjective

20:35.240 --> 20:36.240
content.

20:36.240 --> 20:37.240
Context.

20:37.240 --> 20:44.760
So you never end with, you never use I as a subject.

20:44.760 --> 20:50.640
I mean, as a, as a object, it is a grammar throwdown going on in our chat room anyway.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.760
Don't you dare step to me in my grammar.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.120
All right, moving on.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.120
Come on.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.120
I will conjugate you to death.

20:58.120 --> 21:03.600
Anyway, so, uh, as it turned out, George ended up picking up a Fire Emblem for Dan because

21:03.600 --> 21:12.200
Dan loves his Fire Emblem and Dan's been playing, uh, um, uh, crap.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.200
I just forgot it.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.880
Oh, uh, Ace Attorney.

21:14.880 --> 21:19.320
He's been really into it and hasn't been sleeping because he's doing the damn cases.

21:19.320 --> 21:28.480
Um, also, um, at any rate, uh, what I've been playing is since he beat Zelda in like four

21:28.480 --> 21:33.920
days, I'm playing it now and I just finished, uh, the Eastern palace and I like a lot of

21:33.920 --> 21:37.680
the throwbacks to the, um, link to the past.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.640
It was, I pretty happy with it.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.360
I think it was a worthy purchase and one that we're both enjoying.

21:42.360 --> 21:48.640
So, uh, as far as other things, I'm playing, still playing the Stanley parable off and

21:48.640 --> 21:52.240
on just so, you know, cause there's so many different endings for it, but I don't want

21:52.240 --> 21:53.240
it to get stale.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.800
So I'm playing it a bit at a time.

21:54.800 --> 22:02.320
I bought a game called the Shiva, um, which is about a rabbi and it's, it's a kind of

22:02.320 --> 22:06.560
a, a horror story from what it looks like or an investigative story.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.140
So like a mystery.

22:08.140 --> 22:10.100
So it looked interesting to me and it was cheap.

22:10.100 --> 22:14.320
And then I bought, uh, some other game called 9.3 M or something.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.320
I don't know.

22:15.320 --> 22:16.800
It was cheap too.

22:16.800 --> 22:22.820
And uh, I've just been trying to get through what's in my steam library and you know, I've

22:22.820 --> 22:25.400
got a few more things on my list, so we'll see what happens.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.880
But my goal is to play a different game every week.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.240
That's in my steam library, library, my library.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.640
That's that's a lofty goal because you know that, that those steam libraries build up

22:35.640 --> 22:36.640
quick.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.860
Well, I've got enough games to play a different game every week for the next 10 years.

22:40.860 --> 22:41.860
So I think I'll be good.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.860
I could do that easily for a year and a half, even just uninstalled alone right now.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.100
I could do that for at least a year.

22:47.100 --> 22:52.300
I can probably talk about, uh, my own steam library, but I made, I made a dent in the

22:52.300 --> 22:55.860
backlog this week and I will get into that in just a little bit.

22:55.860 --> 22:59.260
But dark soccer, if you are done with your gaming week, I am, then I think we're going

22:59.260 --> 23:04.620
to go ahead and we're going to go over to the phones, uh, and we are going to get our

23:04.620 --> 23:07.220
buddy Matt Kahn on the line.

23:07.220 --> 23:13.540
Matt Kahn is the founder of GamerX and he is behind a new Kickstarter for Read Only

23:13.540 --> 23:15.500
Memories, a new cyberpunk adventure.

23:15.500 --> 23:19.020
So we're going to ask him about, you know, what's going on with GamerX and what's going

23:19.020 --> 23:22.500
on with this new game and how awesome is Snatcher and so forth.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.140
Uh, and I believe Matt is there.

23:24.140 --> 23:25.140
Matt, you on the line?

23:25.140 --> 23:26.140
I am.

23:26.140 --> 23:27.140
Hey, how are you guys doing?

23:27.140 --> 23:28.140
I'm great.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.140
Welcome to Orange Launch Radio, Matt.

23:29.140 --> 23:30.140
Great to have you here.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.100
Yeah, I'm super excited to be on the show.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.460
I really wanted to come on for a while, so.

23:34.460 --> 23:35.460
Thank you.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.860
Oh my gosh, we should have had you on last time you had a Kickstarter to promote because

23:38.860 --> 23:44.580
I gave a lot of money to that Kickstarter and it was, it was, no, it was totally worth

23:44.580 --> 23:45.580
it.

23:45.580 --> 23:49.260
I had, and thank you for, for putting that together and I know you have a whole team

23:49.260 --> 23:51.340
behind you and they all deserve kudos.

23:51.340 --> 23:56.220
Uh, GamerX, I had a fantastic time at GamerX and that was a, that was a great experience

23:56.220 --> 23:59.940
and um, yeah, I, I can't wait for GamerX too.

23:59.940 --> 24:00.940
Awesome.

24:00.940 --> 24:06.780
We're really excited to, uh, to have GamerX too happening, you know, like, uh, we, when

24:06.780 --> 24:11.180
we didn't get, you know, the original GamerX, we weren't sure if there would be the, you

24:11.180 --> 24:16.380
know, the outcry for a second one, but, uh, people seem to have a really good time, so

24:16.380 --> 24:18.700
we're doing a second one and we're really excited about it.

24:18.700 --> 24:19.700
Awesome, awesome.

24:19.700 --> 24:24.540
If you guys have questions for Matt, you can join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, I

24:24.540 --> 24:27.580
got some questions of my own here and I'm sure some of us here in studio also have questions

24:27.580 --> 24:32.300
for him, but I will be throwing in some of your questions as well as we talk about, uh,

24:32.300 --> 24:34.820
GamerX and, and your latest Kickstarter and so forth.

24:34.820 --> 24:37.140
Um, let me ask you a couple of things about GamerX.

24:37.140 --> 24:40.500
So, so there is a GamerX too, that is happening this year, right?

24:40.500 --> 24:41.500
Yep.

24:41.500 --> 24:45.820
Or this next year, 2014, um, and I noticed one of the things I noticed right away, you're

24:45.820 --> 24:49.180
like, the new venue is three times as big as the old one, right?

24:49.180 --> 24:50.180
Yeah.

24:50.180 --> 24:54.420
So, you know, uh, people seem to really like the con last year, um, but I think that, you

24:54.420 --> 25:00.020
know, a lot of our, our, you know, um, first time kind of jitters showed off a little bit

25:00.020 --> 25:03.220
in that, you know, we, we definitely overbooked the hotel.

25:03.220 --> 25:08.860
Like, it was really crowded and, uh, we don't want people to feel, especially, you know,

25:08.860 --> 25:12.580
with a, with a crowd like we have, like we don't want people to feel like it's a claustrophobic

25:12.580 --> 25:16.220
or, you know, we want it to feel super comfortable and super homey.

25:16.220 --> 25:20.620
And, uh, by going to the Intercontinental, uh, not only are we choosing a spot that's

25:20.620 --> 25:23.900
really easy for people who live in the Bay Area to get to because it's right off BART

25:23.900 --> 25:28.380
and all the major Muni lines, uh, but also it's, you know, it's so much bigger.

25:28.380 --> 25:33.540
It's three times the size that, you know, even if we grow, you know, even double the

25:33.540 --> 25:37.580
size of attendees, we'll have more than enough space to, uh, you know, make sure they're

25:37.580 --> 25:41.820
all good and have a place to, you know, hang out and chill.

25:41.820 --> 25:45.580
What would you say besides, uh, you know, cause, cause obviously this whole thing was,

25:45.580 --> 25:49.900
was a real adventure for you from the Kickstarter to the execution and, you know, overall and

25:49.900 --> 25:53.940
everything I heard about it was, you know, yeah, it was a little bit crowded, but you

25:53.940 --> 25:57.740
know what, Oh, what a problem for a first year con to have that there's just too much

25:57.740 --> 25:58.740
interest in it.

25:58.740 --> 25:59.740
Right.

25:59.740 --> 26:02.300
So, you know, most everything I was hearing was, it was really, really positive about

26:02.300 --> 26:05.900
the convention and that's how I left, you know, pretty much feeling as well.

26:05.900 --> 26:08.400
What would you say from this whole experience start to finish?

26:08.400 --> 26:12.820
What was, what was the biggest lesson you learned that you could pass on to somebody

26:12.820 --> 26:18.200
else who's thinking about maybe starting something of their own in their town or something for

26:18.200 --> 26:19.680
whatever the cause is?

26:19.680 --> 26:26.920
Um, you know, I think that, you know, we didn't, we, I don't know, because the thing that I,

26:26.920 --> 26:31.960
I feel like I've learned the most is that, uh, you know, we went into gamer X or the

26:31.960 --> 26:36.640
original one without having, you know, any real convention experience behind us.

26:36.640 --> 26:41.280
And so we really overestimated the amount of, you know, major sponsors that were going

26:41.280 --> 26:42.280
to come in.

26:42.280 --> 26:47.400
And, uh, we spent a lot more money bringing in in terms of sponsorship.

26:47.400 --> 26:50.800
Um, and so we were able to, you know, have a really awesome convention, but we spent

26:50.800 --> 26:55.040
more money than we made, um, which is, you know, which is okay, but like when you're

26:55.040 --> 26:58.720
running off of like, you know, we don't have any, any venture capitalists or anything,

26:58.720 --> 27:01.600
um, you know, going into the red is kind of a scary thing.

27:01.600 --> 27:06.560
Um, so I wish I had done better budgeting and also been a little bit more like, I think,

27:06.560 --> 27:11.060
realistic with the fact that, uh, you know, because it was our first year, I think a lot

27:11.060 --> 27:15.960
of companies were scared to kind of come on as, as, uh, as, um, sponsors.

27:15.960 --> 27:19.640
And then also we got a lot of people who were just kind of like, they were too afraid to

27:19.640 --> 27:24.400
kind of touch an LGBT thing, um, that it didn't really fit their brand.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.400
Interesting.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.400
Yeah.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.400
Hmm.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.440
Well now, okay.

27:28.440 --> 27:32.320
So unfortunately I know our own dark soccer did not get to go to gamer X neither did Loki.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.560
Um, but dark soccer is trying to make it at least this year.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.560
I'm hoping.

27:35.560 --> 27:36.560
I hope so.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.560
You got it.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.560
You got to come do a panel with me.

27:38.560 --> 27:39.560
I had a ton of fun.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.760
Uh, but, uh, our buddy here in studio, Jason actually went to gamer X and you are a straight

27:43.760 --> 27:44.880
male who went to gamer X.

27:44.920 --> 27:45.920
I very much am.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.640
Were you persecuted?

27:47.640 --> 27:52.480
Because some of the comments you read on the internet are like, I was scared in a fit.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.160
No, not, not even a little bit.

27:54.160 --> 27:59.880
I mean, I, the short version of this is that I was having a discussion about a month ago

27:59.880 --> 28:02.800
about like the finer points, prejudices and all this stuff.

28:02.800 --> 28:06.800
And I just kind of looked up and I said, screw the labels, be awesome to people.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.320
It was the quick summary.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.720
And I had a hell of a hell of a good time.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.080
I was around plenty of people that I knew.

28:14.080 --> 28:19.120
Uh, I met a couple of people involved, the, um, the guy that was doing visuals, uh, during

28:19.120 --> 28:22.960
the performances on Friday and Saturday night, I wound up having a conversation with him.

28:22.960 --> 28:27.520
I took over the booth for my coworker, uh, so he could go out and get some lunch.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.840
I was talking to people for 30, 45 minutes.

28:29.840 --> 28:34.960
It was as good as all the rest of the cons that I've been to better because it was even

28:34.960 --> 28:35.960
more.

28:35.960 --> 28:36.960
I go to anime cons.

28:36.960 --> 28:37.960
They're okay.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.040
It was more gaming centric and tech centric to an extent.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.040
And I had fun with it.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.040
Awesome.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.040
Well, fun's what it's all about, right?

28:43.040 --> 28:48.760
Uh, look at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, uh, DK pop man says, I want to go to a con

28:48.760 --> 28:50.640
and a code man says, I wish I could go to these cons.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.680
Uh, unfortunately I know these guys don't live out here on the West coast.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.040
So it's a little more of an investment.

28:55.040 --> 28:58.720
Uh, Rama says a lot of straight people go to yaoi con.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.840
So yes, they do.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.840
All right.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.240
Um, so let's see.

29:03.240 --> 29:07.040
I want to, I know you're, I know you're really excited about gamer X map, but I know you

29:07.040 --> 29:10.560
also have this Kickstarter going on right now for this game.

29:10.560 --> 29:14.400
R O M or read only memories, which is a cyberpunk adventure.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.640
Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?

29:16.640 --> 29:17.640
Yeah, sure.

29:17.640 --> 29:22.280
So, you know, at gamer X, you know, we, we had a really great time and, uh, at the end

29:22.280 --> 29:26.240
of the gamer X, we had, you know, our, our kind of, you know, dead dog, like, Hey, tell

29:26.240 --> 29:29.640
us if you, what you hated or tell us your ideas.

29:29.640 --> 29:34.000
And the thing that kept coming up in the question and answer was like, people were wondering

29:34.000 --> 29:37.760
when we were going to do a game, they really liked our mascots.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.720
And, um, it got us to thinking about the fact that like, you know, we have some really

29:40.720 --> 29:46.680
cool mascots and, um, one of my big like things is like, instead of like, I don't believe

29:46.680 --> 29:47.680
in complaining.

29:47.680 --> 29:52.480
Um, like I feel like I could go out and, you know, and no disrespect to people that do

29:52.480 --> 29:58.360
do this, but like I could, you know, uh, campaign to boycott things or make a video series or

29:58.360 --> 30:02.380
do whatever, but I wanted to do something that I thought would, you know, create change

30:02.380 --> 30:06.000
and like, so it created, I wanted to create this like safe, uh, space for, you know, queer

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
gamers.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.160
And then in the same way, it was like, well, you know, we were in a position where we could

30:10.160 --> 30:16.300
harass the EAs and you know, the Nintendos and Sonys and be like, why are there no queer

30:16.300 --> 30:17.860
characters in games?

30:17.860 --> 30:21.760
But we decided instead of doing that, like, let's just make a game that features gay and

30:21.760 --> 30:26.400
lesbian and queer and trans characters in meaningful ways, isn't shoehorned in that

30:26.400 --> 30:28.560
isn't like a joke.

30:28.560 --> 30:33.000
And I think if we, if it does well and we can show that to people, um, I think that

30:33.000 --> 30:36.600
we can kind of show the gaming world that, see like there is an audience for it.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.600
It's not that hard to do.

30:37.600 --> 30:41.400
Um, you know, like if anyone, if like, if we could do it without any experience and

30:41.400 --> 30:45.520
just kind of like kind of starting from scratch, then you guys should be able to do it too.

30:45.520 --> 30:50.680
And more selfishly, I mean, we want to make a game, like who doesn't want to make a game?

30:50.680 --> 30:51.680
I love that.

30:51.680 --> 30:56.400
Well, yeah, I remember one of the, one of the very popular panels at GamerX was when,

30:56.400 --> 30:59.080
you know, one of the game designers got up there and said, all right, everybody, we're

30:59.080 --> 31:00.320
going to make a game right now.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.320
You're all game designers.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.280
And I thought, I thought that was a really awesome approach to it because I honestly

31:04.280 --> 31:07.660
looked at that and I went, oh my God, I wish I thought to do that for podcasting because

31:07.660 --> 31:10.840
I'm so about like getting more people to podcast independent voices.

31:10.840 --> 31:12.840
Why did, Oh, that was such a good idea.

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
You know?

31:13.840 --> 31:14.840
And I just, I thought that was so awesome.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
So yeah, make games.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.080
You should do that next year.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.880
I darn well might, Matt.

31:18.880 --> 31:20.440
I might be talking to you off air about that.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.440
Yeah.

31:21.440 --> 31:24.720
So I mean like one of the cool things is like, I think you're mentioning Anna Antherby's

31:24.720 --> 31:25.720
panel, right?

31:25.720 --> 31:26.720
Yeah, exactly.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.720
Yeah.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.760
So, so she did a game workshop where she was teaching everyone how to use Twime, which

31:29.760 --> 31:33.240
is a really easy to use system to make adventure games.

31:33.240 --> 31:37.840
So one of the cool things is that our engineers who are working on the game, we have two guys

31:37.840 --> 31:46.440
who are doing the programming right now, Ted Denola and Luke, sorry, Luke McCampbell.

31:46.440 --> 31:51.720
And they're actually, they actually built a system where we actually, me and the people

31:51.720 --> 31:54.880
who are non-technical, who are writing the story for the game, we're actually writing

31:54.880 --> 31:57.060
out all the story stuff in Twime.

31:57.060 --> 32:02.800
And they actually built a engine, a tool that will actually translate the Twime script into

32:02.800 --> 32:03.800
Unity.

32:03.800 --> 32:04.800
Oh, wow.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.760
So that way, and then, so you know, once the game comes out, we're actually going to put

32:07.760 --> 32:12.000
that tool up and that's going to become available for people to, you know, like use and like

32:12.000 --> 32:13.800
other people to like use.

32:13.800 --> 32:18.520
So hopefully it'll be easier for people who make Twime games to make visual Twime games.

32:18.520 --> 32:23.560
That is a fantastic benefit to this Kickstarter that I want to make sure we call out here

32:23.560 --> 32:27.040
and kind of highlight is that, you know, if, if, if this is successful and you're able

32:27.040 --> 32:32.000
to put all that together, that can, that can be huge for other people wanting to do this,

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
right?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Yeah.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Yeah.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.640
I mean, it's one of those things where like we, I think that there's a lot of people who

32:37.640 --> 32:43.400
want to be able to make games like this and like, I have no idea how to program, like

32:43.400 --> 32:45.080
I can't program at all.

32:45.080 --> 32:50.240
And the guys who are making the programming of the game on our end, like they're pretty

32:50.240 --> 32:54.160
much building out these systems so that way they're like, they can go, here you go, here's

32:54.160 --> 32:58.080
what the, like they're basically making an RPG maker, you know, like basic system for

32:58.080 --> 32:59.080
me.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.440
So I can just go in and change the text, you know, add in what characters I want to have

33:02.440 --> 33:03.440
and what places.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.920
So that way they don't even, like I don't even need their help to make the game happen.

33:07.920 --> 33:12.720
And once we have that there, like, you know, I feel like there's so many great stories

33:12.720 --> 33:18.920
that should be told that I think Twime's great, but it'd be cool to be able to show some of

33:18.920 --> 33:20.960
those stories in a more visual way.

33:20.960 --> 33:25.280
Well, obviously, you know, when you talk about the visual and the presentation of the game,

33:25.280 --> 33:29.680
there's many references in your Kickstarter, on the Facebook and so forth, to the gaming

33:29.680 --> 33:34.560
classic Snatcher, which I know we here at OLR are very familiar with, you know, we love

33:34.560 --> 33:36.840
Hideo Kojima and, you know, the things he's done.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.880
And you talk about this in the Kickstarter and so forth.

33:39.880 --> 33:45.820
What is it about that particular game that basically makes it like the framework or inspiration

33:45.820 --> 33:48.940
or whatever you want to call it to tell your own story that you're writing?

33:48.940 --> 33:54.820
I mean, well, Snatcher's definitely in my top five games of all time.

33:54.820 --> 33:59.420
And looking at, you know, those top five games, Snatcher seemed like the one that would be,

33:59.420 --> 34:04.140
you know, just from a more realistic perspective of like, what could we actually build with

34:04.140 --> 34:05.140
a small team?

34:05.140 --> 34:10.020
And, you know, a point and click adventure is something that we're like, okay, like,

34:10.020 --> 34:13.340
that's something that we could definitely do and not overreach.

34:13.340 --> 34:19.780
But it was also something where the setting of it, which is, you know, deep in the future,

34:19.780 --> 34:24.060
in Snatcher it's 50 years in the future, so it's in the same, you know, vein, we're 50

34:24.060 --> 34:26.580
years in the future.

34:26.580 --> 34:32.420
You know, we can look at the way that the dynamics of queer culture have changed in

34:32.420 --> 34:38.260
that, you know, back in the 20s, back in the 30s, if you had a kid and he was dating like

34:38.260 --> 34:41.700
an Irish kid or an Irish girl or whatever, you'd be like, oh, you can't date those Irish,

34:41.700 --> 34:42.700
you can't date the Polish.

34:43.060 --> 34:47.020
It's like all that shit that like, by the 60s or 70s, no one even cared about that.

34:47.020 --> 34:50.580
And then in the 60s and 70s, you know, you couldn't date out of your own race and things

34:50.580 --> 34:51.580
like that.

34:51.580 --> 34:54.780
And then people kind of, you know, like those people died off.

34:54.780 --> 34:59.460
And now people are upset about people being trans or genderqueer or being, you know, gay

34:59.460 --> 35:00.460
or lesbian.

35:00.460 --> 35:03.280
And I think as people get over the gay and lesbian thing, then they'll start getting

35:03.280 --> 35:04.780
over the trans and genderqueer thing.

35:04.780 --> 35:11.240
And I think that by 2064, hopefully, you know, most characters in the game will have kind

35:11.240 --> 35:13.300
of gotten over a lot of those things.

35:13.300 --> 35:17.160
And so you'll see a lot more gay and lesbian and queer and trans characters that are in

35:17.160 --> 35:22.840
positions of power or positions where they're not, you know, like on a different social

35:22.840 --> 35:27.360
class as they're like, you know, comparatives.

35:27.360 --> 35:30.840
But there'll still be other like, you know, prejudices, like whether that be people who

35:30.840 --> 35:35.360
are against, you know, like I don't want my daughter to marry a robot, you know, they'll

35:35.360 --> 35:39.640
definitely be, you know, like prejudices and like those things will always exist.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.920
But hopefully, you'll be, especially if you're queer, you'll be able to play this game and

35:43.920 --> 35:49.240
identify with gay or trans or queer characters that are in it that, you know, are, they're

35:49.240 --> 35:52.240
not like just there because they're queer, and they're not going to be just good people

35:52.240 --> 35:53.240
because they're queer.

35:53.240 --> 35:54.240
But, you know.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.080
Was that possibly a hint to the plot?

35:56.080 --> 35:59.160
Because I picked up on, I know this is in the future, and you've got robots in this

35:59.160 --> 36:01.360
game, and you just said, I don't want my daughter to date a robot.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.360
Is that a little hint there?

36:02.360 --> 36:03.360
What might be happening?

36:03.360 --> 36:04.360
Yeah.

36:04.360 --> 36:08.200
So, you know, there's a couple things that we want to introduce, you know, in the game.

36:08.200 --> 36:12.760
There's definitely going to be people who are going to be like cybernetic.

36:12.760 --> 36:16.760
You know, there's these devices called ROMs, and these ROMs can be, you know, we've only

36:16.760 --> 36:20.840
shown off like how Turing looks, but ROMs can be really any size.

36:20.840 --> 36:24.520
They can be, you know, like a wristband, they can be whatever.

36:24.520 --> 36:28.040
Because you know, in the future, we're not going to really like need computers to be

36:28.040 --> 36:32.800
much faster, and computer chips can be so small, they can really fit into anything.

36:32.800 --> 36:37.340
So really, it's about whatever device fits your lifestyle, you know, the best.

36:37.340 --> 36:43.900
And so, you may see people who end up becoming, you know, really dependent on those robots.

36:43.900 --> 36:48.100
So you're going to see, you know, people who probably will develop relationships with their

36:48.100 --> 36:49.100
ROMs.

36:49.100 --> 36:53.020
Because, you know, like people even today, like they kind of fall in love with the internet,

36:53.020 --> 36:57.380
and they're like, man, on the internet, there's all these people who, you know, like it's

36:57.380 --> 37:00.060
a better life than in the real world.

37:00.060 --> 37:01.060
That's very true.

37:01.060 --> 37:02.060
That is very true.

37:02.060 --> 37:05.660
You know, it's going to be interesting to kind of explore that, and one of the things

37:05.660 --> 37:10.620
that I really want to explore with the game is, you know, I come originally from the tech

37:10.620 --> 37:17.460
world, and I saw kind of how like kind of devious that people were in terms of trying

37:17.460 --> 37:23.140
to get into people's privacy, and use that to, you know, do interesting stuff.

37:23.140 --> 37:28.540
And I think that in the next 50 years, you'll see, you know, a real like all that privacy

37:28.540 --> 37:30.380
will be gone.

37:30.380 --> 37:34.060
And you know, like I think we're already kind of starting to see it, but it will be interesting

37:34.060 --> 37:38.700
to kind of be able to talk about that, and actually have a little bit of experience of

37:38.700 --> 37:44.540
like knowing some of the people who are actually like kind of putting these processes into

37:44.540 --> 37:50.220
place now, and knowing kind of what they dream the future to be, and you know, living out

37:50.220 --> 37:51.860
that world, and seeing if people like it.

37:51.860 --> 37:54.380
Because, you know, there's going to be a lot of advantages to that.

37:54.380 --> 37:58.900
Like your ROM will know the size of your clothes, and be like, hey, you need new boxers, and

37:58.900 --> 38:02.700
there's probably, you know, H&M's having a sale, let's go right now, yay!

38:02.700 --> 38:03.700
Interesting.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.940
I like, yeah, the science fiction angle is pretty cool.

38:05.940 --> 38:08.140
You've definitely got quite the story unraveling here.

38:08.140 --> 38:09.140
I like this.

38:09.140 --> 38:10.140
DarkSakura, you have something to throw in?

38:10.140 --> 38:15.620
I was just saying, I was thinking about a little bit of a Shadowrun without the, you

38:15.620 --> 38:19.260
know, extra fantasy elements that Shadowrun throws in, or I was actually getting a big

38:19.260 --> 38:21.540
hit of rifts too.

38:21.540 --> 38:24.020
I don't know if you ever did any tabletop RPGs?

38:24.020 --> 38:26.900
Yeah, I played a little bit of Shadowrun.

38:26.900 --> 38:30.900
So yeah, I mean, it's definitely something where like, you know, we want to kind of keep

38:30.900 --> 38:33.600
it very close to that cyberpunk niche.

38:33.600 --> 38:39.520
So you're going to see a lot of things that are, you know, like if you watch Blade Runner,

38:39.520 --> 38:44.920
Snatcher, Rise of the Dragon, you know, anything that is like cyberpunk-y, like we're going

38:44.920 --> 38:47.800
to try to keep that as much as possible.

38:47.800 --> 38:54.000
While I think one of the biggest things that's changed is that in the 80s and early 90s when

38:54.000 --> 38:58.160
a lot of these cyberpunk things came out, they never could have predicted for what the

38:58.160 --> 39:00.320
internet would be.

39:00.320 --> 39:06.400
And so in our game, we're going to acknowledge that the internet exists and that data is

39:06.400 --> 39:12.920
like this unlimited source of data that can be transmitted anywhere at any time.

39:12.920 --> 39:18.880
And it'll be interesting to see, but also apply kind of a lot of that cyberpunk CRT

39:18.880 --> 39:24.720
monitor FM sounds, you know, like make it feel very 80s and a little backwards at times

39:24.720 --> 39:25.720
too.

39:25.720 --> 39:30.080
Once again, the Kickstarter is for a game ROM Read Only Memories.

39:30.080 --> 39:33.440
If you want to check that out, unfortunately Kickstarter doesn't really have short URLs,

39:33.440 --> 39:37.120
so I would encourage you to just search for that, Read Only Memories.

39:37.120 --> 39:42.600
You can also back this and some of the rewards include, just for $6, it looks like, for $6

39:42.600 --> 39:47.400
we'll get you the unlock code for the full version when it's released on Ouya or Mac

39:47.400 --> 39:49.040
and PC.

39:49.040 --> 39:53.280
Some of the other rewards, $20, this is the one that I actually personally did, where

39:53.280 --> 39:56.840
you can get your name, company, or website in the credits, because I wanted to give a

39:56.840 --> 39:59.360
little OrangeLawnsRadio.com love in the game.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.080
Alright, I gotta ask, why the Ouya?

40:02.080 --> 40:05.800
Oh, so, well, the cool thing is that they're gonna double our money.

40:05.800 --> 40:06.800
Oh, okay.

40:06.800 --> 40:07.800
Makes sense.

40:07.800 --> 40:12.920
Basically, you know, all that we have to do is that when we launch the game, we're gonna

40:12.920 --> 40:17.920
release it on Mac and PC, and if we hit a stretch goal, also Linux, and then also Ouya

40:17.920 --> 40:18.920
at the same time.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.240
So we're gonna release it on all four of those platforms.

40:20.240 --> 40:24.160
That's right, I forgot that they open that up to where you can also publish on PC to

40:24.160 --> 40:28.600
be qualified for their, you know, one of the games or whatever they call the thing.

40:28.840 --> 40:32.800
So we're gonna release that game, and we're gonna release it on Steam and PC and Mac and

40:32.800 --> 40:34.200
Ouya all at the same time.

40:34.200 --> 40:40.680
And then, in the six months between when we release it on those systems, and then we release

40:40.680 --> 40:45.720
it on iOS and Android, we'll spend those six months making sure that we fix any bugs that

40:45.720 --> 40:50.160
may have been in the original releases, you know, making it suitable for touch screen

40:50.160 --> 40:53.640
interfaces, you know, making improvements specifically for mobile.

40:53.640 --> 40:58.360
So in actuality, it'd be cool if we released it all at the same time, but we can actually

40:58.360 --> 41:01.520
use that time to make it better.

41:01.520 --> 41:06.080
And yeah, I mean, like, it's free money, and it's something where, like, I'm a big fan

41:06.080 --> 41:10.960
of the idea of the Ouya, like, I like the Android platform, I like the idea that people

41:10.960 --> 41:12.920
can create anything and put it up there.

41:12.920 --> 41:17.320
I mean, I know they've made a lot of PR mistakes, and I know that they're not, like, beloved

41:17.320 --> 41:22.080
by everyone, and, you know, we knew that it wasn't gonna be, like, the best PR decision

41:22.080 --> 41:27.840
to do it, but, like, there's really, you know, like, I still believe it's a good idea, and

41:27.880 --> 41:31.400
I think that this is, like, that's the kind of system that our game would actually be

41:31.400 --> 41:37.160
perfect for, where, like, a long-term story-based adventure game doesn't really exist on that

41:37.160 --> 41:41.160
system, and, I don't know, I think that that might be something that PEW would be into.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.160
That'd be pretty cool.

41:43.160 --> 41:45.760
Let me, I wanna get to some of the chat room questions that we have, too, because we have

41:45.760 --> 41:50.320
a few questions in chat, and I have a couple other questions I wanna ask, though.

41:50.320 --> 41:53.640
One of them here about the music in the game, because I was, I was, I definitely noticed

41:54.160 --> 41:58.720
you had some artists who agreed to help out with the game, Aethernaut, Ver, you know,

41:58.720 --> 42:01.280
some names that people oughta know.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.280
What kind of soundtrack you try to make with this game?

42:03.280 --> 42:08.240
You know, so one of the things that was really cool about Snatcher was that, although, like,

42:08.240 --> 42:12.200
it was a very, very simple game, like, it was just text, you know, select text, select

42:12.200 --> 42:16.640
text, menus, it had really, really awesome visuals, but more importantly, because it

42:16.640 --> 42:22.960
ran on Sega CD, it had really amazing music, and it was, you know, the music was way out

42:23.000 --> 42:27.120
of proportion for the visuals, and in the same way, like, we wanna have very kind of

42:27.120 --> 42:33.040
simple, kind of very, like, 80s, 16-bit visuals, but we want really, like, awesome music, and

42:33.040 --> 42:37.200
so music has been one of the things that we wanted to focus on from the beginning, is,

42:37.200 --> 42:41.640
you know, getting really awesome artists who want to come on, you know, come and be involved

42:41.640 --> 42:45.480
with the game, and, like, you know, we actually just released yesterday on our Kickstarter

42:45.480 --> 42:50.040
update, like, a style sheet of some of the songs that really influenced us, so, like,

42:50.080 --> 42:55.720
you know, some of those include, like, games from the PC-88, and, like, the UNO field stage,

42:55.720 --> 43:02.360
and Shin Megami Tensei IV, just all these, like, kind of, like, FM synth-y, very, like,

43:02.360 --> 43:05.640
it's kind of hard to explain, but if you check out the list, we have just some of the music

43:05.640 --> 43:11.040
that inspires us, and, um, Athernaut, and Vert, and Too Mellow, and all these people

43:11.040 --> 43:15.120
that we're working with, like, they just really dug the vibe, and, you know, I think a lot

43:15.120 --> 43:19.400
of them were big fans of Snatcher growing up, and they were really into the idea of,

43:19.400 --> 43:23.760
uh, kind of giving it a try to, you know, making something cyberpunk-y.

43:23.760 --> 43:26.920
Alright, I got one more question for you, and then we're gonna go to some of our chat

43:26.920 --> 43:30.760
questions at live.vognetwork.com. It's not too late to get your question in if you have

43:30.760 --> 43:36.720
a question for Matt Kahn, uh, with GamerX, and Read Only Memories. Um, Matt, I ask this

43:36.720 --> 43:41.720
of everybody who comes on this show to pitch a Kickstarter, so I'm gonna ask you as well.

43:41.720 --> 43:47.920
Um, the funding you're trying to raise for this $62,064, which is kind of a funny number,

43:47.920 --> 43:52.120
but, um, what, what do you need that money for? Where is that money gonna ultimately

43:52.120 --> 43:53.120
go?

43:53.120 --> 43:57.360
Sure. So, um, couple things. So, you know, we, we've, we're working with a team of seven

43:57.360 --> 44:03.080
people. Um, myself, I'm producing the game. We have, uh, John James, who's our lead artist.

44:03.080 --> 44:07.240
Uh, we have, uh, I'm sorry, let me actually make sure I don't get any of his names wrong.

44:07.240 --> 44:13.000
Luca Campbell and, um, Ted Danola, they're programming the games. Uh, Ted Danola is,

44:13.000 --> 44:17.320
uh, he used to work at Zynga and Hubby Bunch Productions, and he's, like, was super duper

44:17.320 --> 44:21.760
legit, and he's leading up the, the programming side of things. And so, you know, we've only

44:21.760 --> 44:25.440
started, you know, really getting this program done in the last couple months, and things

44:25.440 --> 44:31.000
have been ramping up super quickly, uh, with him. Um, and then we have, you know, uh, Tumelo,

44:31.000 --> 44:35.200
and we have, uh, Fred, and we have, uh, all these other people who are working on the

44:35.200 --> 44:39.780
music, and especially with, like, people like Athernaut and Vert, like, I could get

44:39.780 --> 44:43.760
them to give us a good deal on music, but I'd rather that, like, they get paid a fair

44:43.760 --> 44:47.600
amount for their work. Um, so, you know, we're just making sure, I wanna make sure that everyone

44:47.600 --> 44:51.520
gets a fair amount, uh, you know, to work on this game. So between all those people,

44:51.520 --> 44:56.240
and then we also have Shams, who's our CFO, mid-boss, and who's gonna be doing all the

44:56.240 --> 45:00.880
fulfillment and stuff. Um, it's a lot of work, and, you know, so the money's mostly going

45:00.880 --> 45:07.480
into paying, you know, those people. Then there's also the Unity fees, um, the, you

45:07.480 --> 45:11.120
know, the actual distribution fees of getting those games out there, and then, you know,

45:11.120 --> 45:15.080
uh, just, like, paying for, like, I wanna have more music, I wanna have more artists

45:15.080 --> 45:18.780
come on board, and I wanna make sure they get, you know, treated right.

45:18.780 --> 45:22.080
And I do notice you have some stretch goals to hopefully, hopefully if you can, uh, get

45:22.080 --> 45:26.200
there, provide, uh, an actual soundtrack, OST, if you've backed to a certain level,

45:26.200 --> 45:30.460
a Linux port, and possibly an art book at different stretch goal levels. But, uh, we

45:30.460 --> 45:35.100
are looking at, uh, 11 days to go, and you've got about 20k to go. So you're, you're on

45:35.100 --> 45:39.220
track, so, um, but, but, you know, every little bit helps, especially meeting those stretch

45:39.220 --> 45:43.540
goals. Uh, if you guys are listening here at vognetwork.com, uh, or on the podcast feed

45:43.540 --> 45:47.540
or on Stitcher, uh, definitely encourage you guys to check this out. Uh, you can keep tabs

45:47.540 --> 45:51.660
on, uh, Matt's projects. Uh, gamerconnect.com would probably be the best place to send them.

45:51.660 --> 45:54.380
I'm, I'm not sure where, where your hub is for, for all this.

45:54.380 --> 45:58.300
Yeah. Well, I mean, we're actually making a bunch of changes right now, because, like,

45:58.300 --> 46:03.200
you know, we, now that we're not just doing gamer acts, um, we're now kind of reforming

46:03.200 --> 46:08.700
as mid-boss, in a way. So, I mean, now we have a game, and we have the, the, the convention.

46:08.700 --> 46:12.780
We're working really hard on gamerconnect.com to get it up to, like, being something really

46:12.780 --> 46:15.940
awesome. But it's just really tough, because it, like, it's basically, we're trying to

46:15.940 --> 46:21.260
emulate a lot of features that Facebook has, and it's just hard with one person, you know,

46:21.260 --> 46:26.540
programming it to keep it up. Um, but we, we actually just released, like, a new newsfeed

46:26.580 --> 46:30.900
today, and we really want it to be a place where, like, if you're a queer geek, you can

46:30.900 --> 46:35.620
go and talk about games and relax. Um, and, you know, we just need to put more work into

46:35.620 --> 46:40.540
it and make sure that, like, it's, runs fast and looks good. And, um, part of that is just

46:40.540 --> 46:44.860
we don't really have the money yet to, to hire people to do that. Um, but yeah, so if

46:44.860 --> 46:49.220
you go to Gamer Connect, it has, uh, all, all of our projects. Uh, Gamer X 2 is next

46:49.220 --> 46:54.340
July. Um, and you can get your tickets now. Um, and also, one of the cool things about

46:54.380 --> 47:00.380
Read Only Memories is you can actually get tickets for Gamer X 2, uh, in the, the rewards,

47:00.380 --> 47:01.700
um, for the Kickstarter.

47:01.700 --> 47:02.140
Nice.

47:02.140 --> 47:07.940
And, um, so, like, the, for the $79 level, that's only $9 more than a regular three-day

47:07.940 --> 47:12.780
ticket. Um, and then for that, you get, you know, three copies of the game, you get the

47:12.780 --> 47:17.540
beanie, you get the stickers, and you get a ticket to the con, and that money gets doubled

47:17.540 --> 47:21.780
for us because of OUYA, so you're helping us out too. So, it's a good deal.

47:21.780 --> 47:24.340
Awesome. Well, Matt, I hope we're not taking up too much of your time, but I do want to

47:24.340 --> 47:26.740
get some chat questions, if you don't mind, just a couple quick ones here.

47:26.740 --> 47:27.140
Yeah, sure.

47:27.140 --> 47:32.460
Uh, DungeonBuster in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, asking, will ROM have action sequences like

47:32.460 --> 47:37.100
in Snatcher? As good as Snatcher is, I think it could just stood well enough without them,

47:37.100 --> 47:40.580
and if you do have them, will there, will there be an option to skip them?

47:40.580 --> 47:47.580
Yeah, so, uh, I don't want there to be action sequences. Um, you know, I did not, so, I

47:48.500 --> 47:53.540
didn't mind the action sequences in, um, in Snatcher. I actually thought that they were

47:53.540 --> 47:58.660
okay. Uh, I, if you've ever played Policenauts, which is sort of like the spiritual sequel

47:58.660 --> 48:05.260
in a way to Snatcher, um, I did not enjoy the action sequences in that. That was too,

48:05.260 --> 48:10.620
like, with Snatcher, they had, like, the, um, like the grid format, they totally ditched

48:10.620 --> 48:15.500
it for Policenauts, and this expected you had a light gun, um, so it's impossible to

48:15.500 --> 48:21.420
play, like, as emulation or without the gun. Um, and then with Rise of the Dragon, it just

48:21.420 --> 48:28.220
has the worst, awful, just disgusting arcade elements you've ever seen in your life. Like,

48:28.220 --> 48:32.340
it's got this really cool gameplay, and then you go into the arcade elements, and your

48:32.340 --> 48:37.140
character, when he jumps, he jumps, like, 30 feet in the air, and it just, it is, like,

48:37.140 --> 48:42.140
it's disgusting. Like, if you, like, if you play it, you would be sick to your stomach.

48:42.140 --> 48:46.780
Um, so that being said, you know, like, we also don't have, like, a ton of experience

48:46.780 --> 48:51.540
with, you know, like, this is a pretty new team, and we have two really awesome programmers,

48:51.540 --> 48:57.140
but, um, you know, I've seen what we're doing with the, uh, with the dialogue and inventory

48:57.140 --> 49:02.540
and how we're working on that, and I feel like, you know, I don't want to shoehorn anything

49:02.540 --> 49:07.340
in that isn't going to feel natural to the game. Um, if there is going to be minigames,

49:07.340 --> 49:12.420
it would probably be more around, like, hey, you need to move these wires around to unlock

49:12.420 --> 49:16.820
this puzzle. Um, so I would think that it would be more around, like, puzzle stuff,

49:16.820 --> 49:22.660
and things, you know, that aren't, like, time-based or, or whatever, um, because I've, I've usually

49:22.660 --> 49:27.220
found that in adventure games, uh, action scenes, while they're fun and they kind of

49:27.220 --> 49:32.900
keep you on your toes, can be really, really frustrating, um, and not, and, and not very

49:32.900 --> 49:39.220
fun, uh, because, um, um, it can be a blockade to progress the story, too, which I, I can

49:39.220 --> 49:42.340
totally see that element of it, like, how many times have, like, forget it, I can't

49:42.340 --> 49:45.500
get past this one thing in the game, forget it, I'm out, I'm out, and then, you know,

49:45.500 --> 49:50.460
you would miss the story, so I, I totally, I totally hear you on that. Um, one more question

49:50.460 --> 49:55.300
here from chat, this is a question about GamerX, uh, from SSJ100Matt in the, uh, chat room

49:55.300 --> 50:00.300
at live.vognetwork.com asks, um, I understand this is still very new, but what do you see

50:00.340 --> 50:04.660
as the future of GamerX, what is the next step, because this is a great idea that I

50:04.660 --> 50:11.540
could see growing even more. Yeah, I mean, you know, our, our, the whole plan for GamerX,

50:11.540 --> 50:16.980
we recently, you know, appointed a new president, whose, uh, name's Tony, and they are awesome,

50:16.980 --> 50:21.980
um, and the, the idea for GamerX is, like, when we first created it, and when I first

50:21.980 --> 50:26.740
created SFGamers, I wanted there to be a safe space for other, you know, gay and queer gamers

50:26.740 --> 50:32.260
like myself, and I kind of used the word gamer because I kind of always kind of thought

50:32.260 --> 50:35.940
that was a really super-inclusive word. Uh, you know, I always, but, you know, the more

50:35.940 --> 50:39.740
I've, I've kind of met people, I've realized that the name is kind of, in a way, it can

50:39.740 --> 50:43.620
be a little off-putting to straight people who want to come, and, and people who want

50:43.620 --> 50:50.060
to come who aren't necessarily gay, uh, identifying, um, and I don't want the con to be something

50:50.060 --> 50:54.380
where people feel uncomfortable going because of the name, or even because of the vibe,

50:54.380 --> 50:58.540
you know, I want the vibe just to be a place where anyone, no matter whether they be gender

50:58.540 --> 51:05.500
queer, or straight, or, you know, a furry, or an ally, or a trans, or bi, or just a woman,

51:05.500 --> 51:10.860
anyone who maybe feels like they aren't culturally accepted by, like, the mainstream gaming media

51:10.860 --> 51:15.220
to be able to come and feel like they're on an equal-level playing field where people

51:15.220 --> 51:18.940
aren't going to judge you because of, you know, some preconceived notions of, like,

51:18.940 --> 51:21.980
oh, well, you're a girl, so you can't play games, or you're gay, you can't play games,

51:21.980 --> 51:26.380
or whatever, I mean, I think you look at, like, players like Scarlett, who almost just

51:26.380 --> 51:30.140
won the world championships for League of, not League of Legends, Starcraft, and, you

51:30.140 --> 51:35.100
know, who's a trans woman, and it's like, obviously, women and queer people can play

51:35.100 --> 51:39.260
games, um, you know, I want it to be a place where everyone's treated with respect, but

51:39.260 --> 51:42.180
I want it to also be a place where, like, if you're a straight person, like, I'm sick

51:42.180 --> 51:45.580
of people being like, oh, I can't go to this because it's a gay event, I'm like, no, it's

51:45.580 --> 51:52.340
like, it's not really like that, it's more like, um, almost, and I even hesitate to compare

51:52.340 --> 51:56.700
it to this, but like an LGBT film festival, where it's like, you know, you might see some

51:56.700 --> 52:01.060
films that have queer content in them, or you might have conversations that have, that

52:01.060 --> 52:05.220
talk about some gay stuff, but like, for the most part, it's a gaming convention, and I

52:05.220 --> 52:09.740
think that you'll find that most gamers, you know, care more about games than anything

52:09.740 --> 52:14.140
else in their lives, but that being said, you know, the gays and the queers of us also

52:14.140 --> 52:18.180
deserve to be able to feel comfortable and be able to flirt with one another in a safe

52:18.180 --> 52:19.180
environment.

52:19.180 --> 52:23.780
Um, an interesting response here from Queen Simia in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

52:23.780 --> 52:28.820
says there's that, and I thought personally, if I attended GamerX as a straight cis woman,

52:28.820 --> 52:30.420
I'd be invading a safe space.

52:30.420 --> 52:32.740
I don't, I don't think that's the case at all.

52:32.740 --> 52:38.100
No, no, I mean, like, you know, we actually had Anita Sarkeesian was there, and we had

52:38.100 --> 52:42.140
a ton of really awesome women who came, who were just, you know, regular cis, you know,

52:42.140 --> 52:47.020
just, you know, cis women, and, you know, they actually really enjoyed it, and like,

52:47.020 --> 52:52.300
I feel like it's something where, you know, where it's kind of almost comparable to a

52:52.300 --> 52:57.160
gay club, where it's like, a lot of cis women go to gay clubs in San Francisco because they

52:57.160 --> 53:01.220
know that they'll be in a safe space, where they know that they'll be treated with respect,

53:01.220 --> 53:05.420
and, you know, like, they're not going to be, like, groped on or, like, hit on, like,

53:05.420 --> 53:10.580
unnecessarily, and just be able to dance and have fun, and in the same way, you know, like,

53:10.580 --> 53:16.260
I think it's just, like, we, we, I think we as gamers, and by that I mean, like, queer

53:16.260 --> 53:20.100
gamers, like, we don't want other people to not come.

53:20.100 --> 53:23.620
I think that we want people to acknowledge who we are.

53:23.620 --> 53:27.860
I think it, the more that people acknowledge, hey, that, you know, we are an existing group,

53:27.860 --> 53:31.060
and that, you know, we're just like you and everyone else, like, that's really, really

53:31.060 --> 53:35.400
important, because, like, I don't subscribe to that whole idea of, like, oh, we're making

53:35.400 --> 53:39.620
gamer acts to make an exclusionary event, you know, you should only go to gamer acts

53:39.660 --> 53:43.500
and don't go to PAX and don't go to E3, because, like, that's silly, like, people can go to

53:43.500 --> 53:48.820
as many conversations as they want, what can I afford to go to, and this is just a different

53:48.820 --> 53:53.140
experience that, like, one that, like, we're trying to kind of create, like, something

53:53.140 --> 53:55.660
that's not really out there right now.

53:55.660 --> 54:00.860
Yeah, you know, I gotta say, Matt, as, as somebody who, you know, for a period in my

54:00.860 --> 54:04.940
late teens and early 20s, I literally thought I was the only gay nerd, like, I, I, there

54:04.940 --> 54:08.620
was one, I thought I was the only gay nerd on the whole damn planet, so, to now, you

54:08.620 --> 54:12.940
know, maybe, maybe now I'm in my mid-30s, but to see something like this happen was,

54:12.940 --> 54:16.900
was really amazing, Matt, and I, I gotta thank you and your team for doing this, because

54:16.900 --> 54:21.220
I'm, like, oh, my God, and I'm, I'm speaking from experience here, you guys, like, to be

54:21.220 --> 54:24.940
that 18 or 19-year-old who is thinking that, like, I am the only gay nerd on the entire

54:24.940 --> 54:28.980
planet to be, to be shown, like, no, you're not.

54:28.980 --> 54:31.820
You're the only gay nerd in the village.

54:31.820 --> 54:37.740
But, but, no, you're not, and to have, to, to kind of have that celebration, not just,

54:37.740 --> 54:43.620
like, look, other gay nerds, but a celebration of all things nerd is just, I, it, it meant

54:43.620 --> 54:46.380
a lot to me personally, and I was so happy to see it happen, so.

54:46.380 --> 54:47.380
Oh, thank you.

54:47.380 --> 54:52.300
I mean, like, that's kind of my whole goal with it, is, like, I think back to my 16-year-old

54:52.300 --> 54:56.740
gay nerdy self and, like, how much of the time I would either hang out with gay people

54:56.740 --> 55:00.580
and I would, like, have to hide being a nerdy, or I would hang out with nerdy people and

55:00.580 --> 55:06.380
have to hide being gay, and I felt like I was living a lesser life than my true self,

55:06.380 --> 55:10.020
and I feel like if people can look at GamerX and see there's thousands of other queer

55:10.020 --> 55:13.940
geeks out there just like them, hopefully they won't feel like they're alone.

55:13.940 --> 55:17.820
They feel, you know, the whole point of creating GamerConnect was so that way people can, you

55:17.820 --> 55:21.180
know, can connect with their community and find other people in their community, and,

55:21.180 --> 55:25.980
like, I remember, like, being in college and finding gaygamer.net and being, like, this

55:25.980 --> 55:31.220
is what I've been, like, looking for my entire life, and I, I felt like if I can help other

55:31.220 --> 55:34.460
people find that, like, that's, like, my calling in a way.

55:34.500 --> 55:36.340
Uh, Jamie, you have one more thought here?

55:36.340 --> 55:38.220
Oh, it wasn't a very big thing.

55:38.220 --> 55:41.220
I was actually just wondering how the asexual turnout is.

55:41.220 --> 55:44.980
Um, you know, we, so we don't obviously ask people at the door.

55:44.980 --> 55:47.580
Well, I mean, but I was just wondering if there was representation.

55:47.580 --> 55:52.340
Oh, yeah, I mean, so the thing is that, like, we, we try to accommodate, like, everything

55:52.340 --> 55:57.420
in terms of, like, panels, like, I, I don't remember exactly what panels we had last year

55:57.420 --> 56:02.580
off the top of my head, but I know that we had panels that, that, I know for sure that

56:02.580 --> 56:06.140
we had panels that were submitted about, like, you know, it being asexual and being

56:06.140 --> 56:11.460
in the community, and, you know, as someone who, I dated someone who was asexual, um,

56:11.460 --> 56:15.260
I think that's, you know, like, I, I obviously don't think that there's any lifestyle that

56:15.260 --> 56:19.340
isn't valid, but, like, I totally understand, and I want that, I think a lot of people have

56:19.340 --> 56:24.180
a lot of ignorance about, um, people who are asexual, and I think that, um, more education

56:24.180 --> 56:28.700
along those lines would be great, um, so, uh, although I can't, like, I can't speak

56:28.700 --> 56:32.580
to the, to the attendance of it at that level, I would love to see more panels by people

56:32.580 --> 56:37.300
who either identify as asexual, who want to talk about asexual, you know, ideas, especially

56:37.300 --> 56:40.980
as they pertain to gaming, at GamerX, too, I think that would be super duper awesome.

56:40.980 --> 56:43.660
It's, it's funny, I actually did have an idea for a panel.

56:43.660 --> 56:44.660
Yeah, bring it on.

56:44.660 --> 56:46.660
We better, we better write that down.

56:46.660 --> 56:50.660
Asexuality and shipping, why it's a nightmare.

56:50.660 --> 56:55.380
Uh, so, yeah, I, you know, GamerX, definitely a celebration of diversity, and I think it's

56:55.380 --> 56:57.820
only gonna be a bigger celebration in this next year.

56:57.940 --> 57:03.060
Uh, Matt, I wish you the best of luck with GamerX, too, and, uh, and your team, as well.

57:03.060 --> 57:07.100
I know, I know, uh, Tony is, is leading it now, and, and, uh, it will, it will be fabulous

57:07.100 --> 57:09.700
with the, uh, group that you helped assemble last year.

57:09.700 --> 57:10.700
I know it.

57:10.700 --> 57:14.500
Uh, and of course, with this game, Read Only Memories, a new cyberpunk adventure, please

57:14.500 --> 57:18.300
check it out on Kickstarter, take a look at the video, and, uh, let's see if we can't

57:18.300 --> 57:22.020
help, uh, Matt raise that $20,000 more they need to get it to happen.

57:22.020 --> 57:27.420
Um, Matt, before I, I get any last plugs from you and let you go, I do have to ask you about

57:27.420 --> 57:31.620
one other topic that's completely different, like, you were not prepared to talk about

57:31.620 --> 57:32.620
this, you ready?

57:32.620 --> 57:33.620
Yeah, I got it.

57:33.620 --> 57:38.980
Alright, okay, I'm gonna bring it, because, here's the thing, now, DarkSakura, she doesn't

57:38.980 --> 57:40.620
watch a lot of reality television.

57:40.620 --> 57:41.620
No, I don't.

57:41.620 --> 57:47.980
But, there is a show in Britain about Britain's worst driver, and they adapted it in Canada,

57:47.980 --> 57:50.540
and you love you, you love yourself some Canada's worst driver.

57:50.540 --> 57:51.540
I love Canada's worst driver.

57:51.540 --> 57:57.020
Did you know that Matt, and this is on Wiki, so I know it's true, Matt was a contestant

57:57.020 --> 57:59.220
on America's worst driver.

57:59.220 --> 58:00.220
Really?

58:00.220 --> 58:05.380
And, Matt, am I correct, now, spoiler alert, Matt, you won the whole damn thing, didn't

58:05.380 --> 58:06.380
you?

58:06.380 --> 58:08.380
Yeah, I am America's worst driver.

58:08.380 --> 58:14.060
Oh my, now, I haven't watched the American one just because I heard that it was, like,

58:14.060 --> 58:17.820
way too Americanized, because the Canadian one is just awesome.

58:17.820 --> 58:21.980
It's like, we teach you how to do stunt driving, and you have to do all this.

58:21.980 --> 58:22.980
It's very polite.

58:22.980 --> 58:26.340
Yeah, well, it is, it is really, well, I don't know, there's this one girl who's kind of

58:26.340 --> 58:31.740
freaking out on, they're doing worst driver ever this season, but what was it like for

58:31.740 --> 58:32.740
you?

58:32.740 --> 58:36.180
I mean, was it embarrassing to be on it, or did you learn something from it, or?

58:36.180 --> 58:41.460
No, well, the thing is that, like, you know, at this point, I don't really care what the

58:41.460 --> 58:42.460
challenge channel does to me.

58:42.460 --> 58:45.700
I mean, so the whole thing was all scripted.

58:45.700 --> 58:50.780
So like, each city that we went to, they would be like, okay, so the rules were, there was

58:50.780 --> 58:55.460
eight, well, okay, so all scripted is maybe not exactly correct, so there's eight cities

58:55.460 --> 58:59.140
that they would go to, and in each of the cities, they said, okay, so there's going

58:59.140 --> 59:02.980
to be four contestants, and the worst driver in the city would have their car destroyed.

59:02.980 --> 59:06.860
However, those contestants would then be brought back for the finale, where seven out of those

59:06.860 --> 59:09.380
eight teams would win brand new cars.

59:09.380 --> 59:13.300
So basically, they're telling you to lose, so that way you'd have a seven out of eight

59:13.300 --> 59:15.780
chance to win a new car.

59:15.780 --> 59:22.060
So in each of the cities, every single, like, it's super fake, because all eight episodes,

59:22.060 --> 59:27.420
the people, everyone's trying to do the worst thing possible, and I was just able to win

59:27.420 --> 59:32.060
in San Francisco, because I was trying to, I mean, I had a really crappy car, and so

59:32.060 --> 59:36.580
I was willing to, like, basically total it on the show either way.

59:36.580 --> 59:40.100
So I was just totally breaking all the rules, I was driving down Lombard Street and crashing

59:40.100 --> 59:42.780
into shit, and I was having a blast.

59:42.780 --> 59:46.620
If you watch the first episode, the first episode of the finale, first episode, I'm

59:46.620 --> 59:50.540
having so much fun, I'm actually, like, I'm never tripping at all, like, I'm just like,

59:50.540 --> 59:55.140
yeah, this is great, I'm having fun, and then in the finale, then it was, like, actually

59:55.140 --> 01:00:00.900
a real contest, where they would have, like, elimination-style challenges.

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:03.780
It's something where they never let you watch the other people compete, and they don't have

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.780
any, like, times.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:10.380
They have to be like, yeah, you won or lost, and someone during my SF thing actually carried

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:14.940
a stopwatch in their pocket, and the time that they got was completely different than

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:18.780
the thing they had in their pocket, which meant that they were like, yeah, this whole

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.780
show's fixed.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:26.660
Anyways, as fixed or not, in the finale, I watched as, you know, as there's eight teams,

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:30.020
and I'm, like, super confident, and I'm just like, yeah, like, you know, I'm not a bad

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.060
driver, there's no way I'm gonna lose all these people, and I watched it go from eight

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:37.260
teams to seven teams to six teams to five teams, and, you know, watching my expression

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:41.300
and, like, I was wearing demon horns in the first episode, like, super fun, and, like,

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.660
having fun, and then by the time there's, like, three teams left, I'm like, shit, I'm

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.660
literally gonna lose.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:49.020
I'm gonna lose not just my car, but, like, everyone else is gonna walk away with a brand

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:53.660
new car, which, before, they were like, oh, yeah, you can just take the value of the car,

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:57.860
so I was like, I'm gonna walk out of here with nothing, and then I got to two teams,

01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.540
and I was like, oh, my God, and if you watch in the last scene where it's, like, me versus

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:05.620
the other team, like, me and my partner are freaking out, because I think we already know

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:10.260
that we're gonna lose, like, it's just pretty obvious it's, like, two, like, little shithead

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:16.060
kids versus, like, this, like, really, really, like, sweet, like, you know, like, older women,

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:20.460
not, like, older, but, like, you know, there are people who didn't deserve to lose versus,

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:27.020
like, two brats, and it was just, you know, I think I knew that, like, storyline-wise

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:32.700
we were gonna lose, I was panicking, and I wasn't driving well, and I lost, and then

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:37.220
they were like, oh, we're gonna, the Robosaurus is gonna destroy the new car, the person who

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:41.140
lost, and then, so, destroyed the car that I would have gotten.

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.700
Did they have Robosaurus in Canada?

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.980
No, this is completely different than the Canadian version.

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:50.220
Yeah, in the Canadian version, they basically pick, like, eight drivers from around the

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.900
different provinces who can't drive for a different reason, and then they actually go

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:58.700
through driver rehab, and if you get voted off, that means you actually were a good driver

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.560
when you graduated rehab.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.020
If you win the whole thing, that means you are the worst driver.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.300
You get, like, a trophy of crashed car parts.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.860
Yeah, so we didn't get, we didn't get any training or anything, like, we just had the

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.460
first episode, and then they were like, come back to the finale, and they never gave us

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:16.100
any, like, training, they just were like, eh.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.100
It just seems like the only similarity is the name, then.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.100
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:25.460
Well, I had to, I had to bring, I know it has nothing to do with video games, but knowing

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.760
that Dark Soccer loves her, Canada is the worst, I had to ask you about that, and I

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.980
even see some comments in the chatroom, Code Man says, I've never watched this, but it

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.540
sounds awesome, Dungeon Buster says, it was cancelled after one season, yes, cancelled

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:36.540
after one season.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.740
Dungeon Buster says, it was the worst show, it was so bad, I knew while we were filming

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:43.420
it was going to be cancelled, and it was so bad.

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.300
I love that you have a great sense of humor about it, though.

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.580
I just wonder if they had kept, like, the original format, if it would have lasted,

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.180
because, I mean, it's on its eighth season in Canada now.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.180
We'll never know.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.180
I bet you they would have, I mean, like, the thing is that when they're filming it, I could

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:58.980
tell it was going to be really bad, and then I found out the time slot was, like, Saturdays

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:04.060
at 10pm, travel channel, I was like, man, they have no confidence in the show.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:08.100
Yeah, see, I've actually learned stuff watching the Canadian version, and I know Canadian

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.100
road signs now.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.180
Are they that different?

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.180
I didn't realize.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.180
There's some that are different.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:16.180
Alright, Matt, we've got to let you go, thank you so much for having a good sense of humor

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:20.740
about that, and seriously, I mean it, I am so looking forward to GamerX2 and everything

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:24.580
your whole team's putting on, and best of luck with Read Only Memories, I hope you make

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.580
it.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.140
Yeah, thank you so much for having me on, like, I'd love to chat more, and yeah, please

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:33.420
check out Read Only Memories, we still have tickets to GamerX2 on there that are, like,

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:37.420
super cheap, and if you back it on there, then we actually, we're just going to basically

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.740
double your money, so you're going to make a really awesome game on top of it.

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:46.180
Awesome, well best of luck to you guys, and yes, we'll keep in touch, and I will see you

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:49.780
at least at GamerX2, if not a heck of a lot sooner, because I'm in San Francisco, like,

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.780
all the time, so.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:55.740
Yeah, we'll get some, you know, some really nice ethnic food, we can go get some Peruvian

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.740
food down in...

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:57.740
Awesome.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:58.740
Good.

01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:01.500
And then you can watch me have seven drinks, like I did last night, make a fool out of

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.500
myself.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.500
Oh, right.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.500
Alright, Matt, buddy, take care, and good luck.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500
Alright, man, have a great day.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.580
Good.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.580
Alright, take care.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.580
Stop.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.580
Alright, that was great.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.580
I like him.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580
Yeah, he's fun.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.580
He's fun.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.580
Alright.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.580
I'm trying to convince Dan to let me buy the $80 package.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.580
Nice.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.580
Dan, money.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.580
Dan, package.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.580
It's Hanukkah, for God's sake.

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:26.420
Well, it is, but he already bought me games, so.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.420
Somebody give me 80 bucks.

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.420
Alright.

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.420
It'll go to a good cause.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.420
It'll go to me.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:33.100
I know that went on a little long, sorry, I think I ate more show than we intended to,

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.420
but Matt was a lot of fun, I had to ask him about the worst driver thing I had to.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.340
Live.vognetwork.com, if you want to keep commenting.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.980
You forgot to ask him what he was playing.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:41.980
I did.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.980
Shame.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.700
What's more important, though, the where's the money going question or the what are you

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:47.700
playing question?

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.220
I think the more important one was the worst driver.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.900
That was, that was the most important question.

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:52.900
Alright.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:58.300
I'm sorry, that was awesome, and now I know that I'm glad I didn't watch the American.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.540
Because I thought about going back to find it, because, you know, you know me, I've seen

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:04.900
every, except for the last two episodes.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.900
You come in here all the time.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:07.380
I hate TV.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.380
I never watch TV, but Canada's the worst driver.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.380
Oh my god.

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:10.380
It's cause I watch it on YouTube.

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.380
Alright.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.380
We gotta get back to games.

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:17.220
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.220
use the passphrase, adult.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:22.660
Quickly, let's try to get through the rest of our gaming weeks, and then some of the

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.660
news as well.

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:24.660
Loki.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.620
So this week I played a few things.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:34.900
I've been meaning to play Fallout New Vegas since last Steam sale, and so I finally got

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:40.340
around to playing it, and I did not like it, and I was so disappointed because I really

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.860
had high hopes for that game, and I just can't get into it.

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:48.500
I think it's just the game itself looks really dated, like I'm running it on Ultra, so it's,

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:52.180
you know, it doesn't look that pretty to begin with.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.220
And I'm sure I could fix some of the stuff with mods, I just haven't gotten around to

01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:00.460
it, and it's like I don't know if I want to spend the effort to do that right now.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:04.420
But anyways, I just didn't like the setting.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:09.300
I didn't like the story, because I didn't understand what the hell was going on, and

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.940
I just didn't like the way it played.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:17.780
There's no fucking sprint for one, at least I couldn't find it.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:22.220
So it was just, I don't know, it bugged me, it just rubbed me the wrong way I guess, and

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:25.700
so I don't know if I'm going to continue on with it.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:31.460
That said, I also played Minecraft this week, just for a little bit.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:36.420
I went ahead and updated my version I had on PC to get the latest thing, because they

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:40.300
just put an update out not too long ago, it's like 1.7.2 now.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.060
I didn't realize that, I need to check it out too.

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:49.180
Yeah, they've got like, it's changed, like holy shit, the biomes now are really intricate.

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:55.180
Like I reloaded our seed that we had, and it's fucking terrible now, let's be honest.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:07:00.380
I'm like oh my god, well this seed's terrible now, I hate it, I'm like in a fucking swamp.

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:03.820
Well what happened to my cool jungle that I was in?

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:08.820
So I just went ahead and, I just messed around with that for a little bit, but yeah, it's

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:09.820
pretty cool.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:13.740
If you just do the new world seed or whatever, there's this huge fucking mountain that appears

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.900
right next to you, and that was kind of neat.

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:20.460
And then they also have the ones where you can spawn these really, I don't know what

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:26.300
they call it, basically exaggerated versions of the different biomes and stuff, almost

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.020
like extreme or something, and it looks really unique.

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.140
Very tall mountains and stuff.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:39.340
I haven't gone around to setting up the multiplayer server, so I don't know about that yet.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:43.980
Then also, I'm hoping for a VoG Minecraft server comeback in 2014, I'm hoping.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.340
I have all the information to do it, I just haven't gone around to it.

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:49.580
There's no more Team Fortress 2 servers, so maybe I can redirect the money.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:54.660
We have, well no, no, we have, Gali has offered us his server, so.

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:58.300
No hate against Team Fortress 2 by the way, I still love Team Fortress 2, it wasn't really

01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.300
being used.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.300
Yeah.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.300
Next game.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:05.340
Gali has a server up, but that's the thing that was getting people on it, because it

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:08.900
was a ghost town, most of the time.

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:12.220
That's kind of the problem with anything that we do, even Team Fortress 2 and stuff, it's

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.060
a ghost town most of the time.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:20.740
So I don't know, and even Creative Mode gets boring after a while, survival at least, there's

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.300
something, if you're playing on your own, there's stuff that you can be doing, whereas

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:28.460
it's like, if you go into Creative Mode, it's like, okay, I'm gonna look around at what

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:31.900
people made, and what am I gonna build now?

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.340
Fuck if I know, I don't know.

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.820
So it's, there's just no happy medium there.

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:41.340
Okay, so anyways, enough Minecraft, and actually, it was just because I was installing it on

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:46.500
my friend's computer, so, because he has an account, he used to play with us occasionally,

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:50.140
and now I built him a PC, so I put it on there for him.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.300
And then Steam Sale, I've been looking at stuff, I almost bought a lot of things, but

01:08:55.300 --> 01:09:00.540
the only thing I bought is just the season pass for Saints Row 4.

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:06.020
Now I know I said I wasn't gonna do that, but it was on sale 66% off, and I feel that

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.020
the price of that is definitely worth what they're giving me, although what it gave me

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:16.260
instead of really shitty DLC was a thing that broke my game, and so now I had to uninstall

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.580
it, and I have to reinstall it and see if that fixes it.

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:21.900
I thought at first, oh, it's because I have mods that I made and put in there and stuff

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:25.980
like that, well I took all those out and it still didn't fucking work, so I'm a little

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:31.100
disappointed that it broke the whole game, so we'll see if I reload it, maybe it'll fix

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:36.820
itself and I can start slowly loading the mods in and see if that works again, but I'm

01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:41.100
just, it's annoying, to say the least.

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:48.180
And then LittleBigGrandpaThoughtOfFive did a, got in the back of a train and got five

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.980
stars and was sniping people with my sniper rifle and stuff as Trevor, so that was kind

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:54.980
of fun.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:58.380
I have to bring this up, you mentioned Steam Sale and Dark Soccer, because it was like,

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:03.380
oh, 6 o'clock, new Flash sales, so she just loaded it up on her iPad, and literally at

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:06.420
the same time we both pointed and went, Deadpool!

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:09.980
I don't care how shitty this game is, I don't care how shitty it is.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:15.380
I'm getting the fucking Deadpool game because fuck, it's Deadpool, and I'm a consumer whore.

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.380
It's one of those nights.

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:22.180
Nah, I was trying to get Bobby to buy Saints Row, they had it down at $19, so I was like,

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:23.180
okay.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:27.300
But yeah, so I've been good, I've been thinking like, okay, I'm gonna buy these games, like

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:35.500
I almost bought Fallout 3, almost bought, what was it, Far Cry 3, almost bought Rise

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:40.060
of the Triad, because that was down to like $5.09.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:44.940
Still might, I don't know, but I'm looking at my library of games I have and I'm like,

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.620
I haven't played most of this stuff.

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.500
If I buy these, I'm not gonna play them either.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:52.820
You need to make a resolution of yourself like Dark Soccer did, that you'll play one

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:53.820
a week.

01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:57.420
I'm not playing one a week, okay, that's not gonna happen.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:03.380
The wife is expecting a new baby soon, and so that means more than you might think right

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:04.380
now, Logan.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:11.620
But like Bioshock, for example, Bioshock Infinite came down to about $7 on Gamefly.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:15.100
I was like, you know, I should just buy it for that, but I'm like, no, I fucking played

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.900
through it on Xbox 360, am I really gonna play through the game again?

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.900
No.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:24.540
Why am I cluttering my fucking account with these games I'm never gonna play?

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.860
So that's kinda where I'm at.

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:33.940
But there is a nice gap between now and when more games are coming out, so I do have time

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:34.980
to catch up.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:40.020
I do want to play more Grand Theft Auto 5, but my wife has been wanting to watch Hulu,

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:43.980
and she doesn't like the Playstation 3 controller, because if you set it on the couch the right

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:48.580
way, or not the right way, it accidentally taps one of those analog sticks and fast forwards

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:53.100
and she throws a fit, I'm like, ugh, fine, so, you know, and I wanted to play with my

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:59.020
360 character to get it up to where my PS3 character is, but I may just have to go PS3,

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.020
I guess.

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.020
Alright, anything else?

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.660
We gotta keep moving here.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:03.660
I can't log in.

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.660
Aww.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:05.660
Well, the good news is you-

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:06.660
I'm still gonna get home.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.660
Yeah, you have until, like, 2 AM.

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.380
Alright, I'm gonna try to quickly go through my gaming week.

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:13.300
A lot of the usual suspects, a lot of the same stuff I talked about this week, continuing

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:17.940
to progress in Zelda and Mario and so forth, but I also fell victim to the Steam sale,

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:22.100
I picked up a few games, I'm gonna try to make this quick, a few games I picked up.

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.100
DLC Quest, I bought.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.620
I did remember what the game I bought was.

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.620
What's that?

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:27.620
Shadowrun.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.620
Oh, okay.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:29.620
Oh, what were you talking about earlier?

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:30.620
Yeah.

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:31.620
DLC Quest.

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:36.180
Like, I like DLC Quest as like a commentary, and obviously it's a little bit biting on

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:38.740
the state of DLC and so forth.

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:46.260
It was a dollar on sale, and that's- it was a fun little adventure game, a little silly,

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.580
it's not particularly difficult, I beat it in one sitting.

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:55.780
There is an expansion, like the freemium isn't free or something like that was the expansion,

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.780
and I'm in the middle of that right now.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:02.260
The game's not really particularly difficult, and at its core, you've really played a game

01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:06.940
like this a thousand times, because since the coin is, you know, the coins that you

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:11.820
used to get the quote-unquote DLC are just things you pick up in game, we've all played

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.740
that game where it's like, now you have to get this item to go unlock this door.

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:19.540
Now you need to get this item to get past this- you know, we've all played a game like

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.180
that before, it's a very common formula in games.

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:26.140
I'm not razzing this game for that, because again, it's a budget game, it's an indie game.

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.140
It's also pretty old, too.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:31.620
Yeah, it has been out a little while, and you have to remember it's more a commentary,

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:37.180
and it does have a funny little script to it, and I did lol a few times, so you know,

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.900
for a dollar or even three dollars or whatever they're asking for it normally, it's a fine

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:47.060
little evening jaunt through DLC Quest, so check that one out.

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.940
I also checked out a game called Splunky, which I'd been wanting to check out for a

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:54.860
long time, and then finally when it hit, what, four bucks or whatever it was, I was like,

01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:00.060
I like this game an awful lot, I am fucking terrible at it, but I find that I'm learning

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.060
more and more.

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:05.660
I'm gonna tell you what I love most about Splunky, I am a whore for roguelike games.

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:09.480
You know, the roguelike games, like Back to the Old School Rogue, and you know, Rogue

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.620
Legacy even is like a roguelike game, obviously, Splunky's kinda like that too, and you find

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:18.500
more layers of the game as you progress, like, oh, I've never seen this item before, what

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.500
does this do?

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:26.820
You know, all the levels are randomly generated, it's fun, and one thing I love a lot about

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:32.740
it is it really reminds me of a classic PC game, but kinda done in modern context.

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.980
I don't really know how else to put my finger on it, but I just feel like when I'm playing

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:41.260
it, I'm playing like an old game on the Commodore 64, but that looks like a game on the PlayStation

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:44.060
3 or the modern PC or what have you.

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:49.340
So I enjoyed Splunky, I was surprised there's no internet multiplayer, but there's local

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:52.860
multiplayer, but there are like challenge boards where one, you know, you'll have a

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:58.220
certain level set that you can only play once per day, and you go as far as you can, and

01:14:58.220 --> 01:14:59.620
once you're done, you're done.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.860
There's a whole community around this game, like live streams of people doing that and

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:08.300
so forth, so I enjoyed Splunky, I think I got it at a steal, I think the game is worth

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:11.420
whatever they're asking for, normally like $15 or what have you, right?

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:14.940
So Splunky, I will probably be talking about this game more in future weeks, we have a

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.940
little more time.

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:23.340
Last game I picked up, Gone Home, I bought for $5 and it was on sale, and I will tell

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:29.980
you this, I was, I started Gone Home at about probably 9 o'clock on Friday night, I just

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:33.860
kind of said, alright, I need to check out this game finally, I started playing it, I

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:38.300
did not get up out of my chair, except maybe to use the restroom and get water, until I

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:44.540
beat the game at about 1am, so I played this thing from start to finish, I was really into

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.540
it.

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:50.300
I will say this, and this is probably a common thing you're going to hear about Gone Home,

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:59.580
it's not really a game, but it's definitely an interactive story, I feel like it's best

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:05.500
described, this is how I felt about it, it's like a first person movie, imagine you control

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:13.100
the movie, that's kind of what this game felt like to me, at its core, I could probably,

01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:16.860
I'm not going to, but I could probably spoil the whole damn thing for you in three sentences,

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:20.900
like the whole game, I'm not going to do that, because that would be a dick thing to do,

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:27.380
and I think watching the layers of it unfold, it's not so much the punchline quote unquote,

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:32.020
like I could tell you those three sentences that would ruin the game for you, but at the

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:38.580
same time I think it's about how we get to that, and all those really kind of unsettling

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:43.460
things and the way things are presented in the game that really made this game a very

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:48.100
special experience, I'm just going to say it's not for everybody, because some people

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:53.500
are going to play this and be like, wait a minute, this is not the game I was expecting

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:58.140
at all, so you got to be prepared that it's going to be a little bit more of a story that

01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:05.260
slowly unravels, and there's really not like challenge to it per se, there's no monster

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:08.460
that's going to jump out from behind the curtain and eat you to death, although you

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:13.060
might get that impression from what you see about the game and so forth, it's actually

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:16.100
very much not like that at all.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:24.020
My one issue with the game is that because I think it was trying to present itself one

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:28.400
way and then kind of end up being another sort of story, I feel like there were things

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.220
in a context that weren't fully explored, I'm being vague on purpose because I don't

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:35.700
want to ruin this for you, but I felt there were certain things that didn't really get

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.100
explored enough.

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:42.060
When the game ended, I did feel resolution, I felt satisfaction, I felt like, wow, that

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:46.780
was a good movie I just watched, like I really felt that when I finished the game, except

01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:49.500
I was like, but what about that subplot?

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:54.380
What about this subplot didn't really resolve, I'm not sure if I missed something or something,

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.540
and I'm trying to think of a non-spoilery way to say this for people who have played

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.620
the game.

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:04.200
The uncle, I'll say that, so if you've played the game you'll notice, but the uncle, I kind

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.300
of feel like that was left unresolved for me, whereas everything else was fine.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:15.240
So for $5 it was definitely worth it, I think the game normally is like, what, 10 or 15,

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:19.740
I just want to caution you, although I felt it was good and you would pay 10 or 15 for

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:25.820
a movie, some people may not feel the value when it's only going to take you 3 to 4 hours

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:30.220
to beat, if that, some of you will probably fly through it faster than me, I'm very, you

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:34.140
know, OCD with the games and looking at every little corner, which actually pays off in

01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.060
this game immensely, I just want to kind of warn you that.

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:40.380
Now there are some things they do to try to enhance the value, like there's a director's

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:44.220
commentary mode you can play through and so forth to try and encourage a second play and

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:48.660
so on, but I just want to warn you, if you're expecting like, oh I'm going to buy this game

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:53.460
and it's going to give me hundreds of hours of satisfaction, think of it more like a movie

01:18:53.460 --> 01:19:00.220
because that's kind of what it is, it's more like an interactive movie, but I sort of,

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:09.360
I sort of really love, how do I put my finger on this, I just kind of love what I think

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:16.660
this game may have started, for, that was incredibly distinct and clear, I know right,

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.860
I feel like this is going to be the first, or maybe not even the first, because I can

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:25.420
think of other games I've played like this, but I think this is going to be a definitely

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.900
notable, and you're seeing it getting game of the year nods and so forth and so on, I

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:33.540
think this is going to be one of those games where we look back and we go, you know, this

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:38.740
is the point that this art form really started to take off.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:43.060
I guess that's the best I can say without like totally ruining things, sorry guys.

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:47.900
Alright, anyhow, clear as mud, I know right, right there with you, alright, if you want

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:51.100
to talk spoilers we can maybe later, I gotta wait for the six months to be out, has it

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:54.860
been out for six months, when it's been out six months I can talk spoilers, because that's

01:19:54.860 --> 01:20:00.220
the agreed upon moratorium on spoilers right, I'll encourage you don't go out there and

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.740
spoil it for yourself, because again it could be spoiled for you in three sentences and

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:07.380
there's some real dickheads that spoil it in comments and so forth, I really think it's

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:14.460
best experience getting in there and doing it, alright, Jason, quickly, your gaming week.

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:19.100
Pretty light week because Monday through Wednesday we're spent wrapping up everything at work

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:26.140
and then I've been around doing a lot of different things, my sale haul was that I picked up

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:31.620
a two pack of Divekick and I need to figure out what to do with the second copy, I picked

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:38.540
up Splunky as well, Final Fantasy 7, the Bioshock triple pack and Counter Strike Go, still not

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:42.460
entirely sure why because I've never been good at that game or anything of the sort

01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:48.260
but I have it and Raginator has thanked me numerous times both in chat and then he mentioned

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:55.260
it when he called into Bobby's show, Bobby Black Wolf, 6pm Pacific, 5pm Pacific, 6pm

01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:01.980
the time zone you're used to, so close, as he sat on his call I picked up the Saints

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:06.140
Row pack for him, he was talking about it, he wanted some stuff to play, it was dirt

01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:11.100
cheap and it is a lot of content, I really enjoyed Saints Row 3, so I threw the pack

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:16.860
his way, because I've been moving around so much this week I've actually gotten back into

01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:21.980
the mobile swing of things again, I picked up Sonic Dash which is just an endless runner,

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:26.260
time killing kind of game, I've been very addicted to Quiz Up in the last week or two

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:29.980
and me and Rob played around with it the other night, that is a fun little iPhone game, very

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:34.220
fun, it's very well curated, which means in 60 days we'll no longer be playing it, that's

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:38.740
what happens to iPhone games, and then there was the other, was it just those two, I feel

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:45.120
like there was a third game that I've been playing, Phone or iPad rather often, but probably

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.860
just Quiz Up and Sonic Dash, the usual suspects, a little bit of Rogue Legacy, a little bit

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:58.060
of FTL, FTL randoms were abysmally terrible and I just got destroyed before I even hit

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:02.880
like the third sector, and a couple more power ups in Rogue Legacy, still plowing through

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.600
that, trying to get further, pick up more equipment, pieces of equipment and upgrades

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.120
and all that, the usual.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:13.400
Alrighty, let me quickly do some housekeeping and then we'll go into the news for tonight,

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.040
so as always I do want to encourage you guys to follow us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:21.460
Orange Lounge Radio and then we'll also be on Twitter, Twitter.com slash O-L-R, I want

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:25.700
to address the YouTube expansion real quick because last week I mentioned I put the show

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:32.340
up on YouTube, it took me a little while to do and so, and I've kind of been able to watch

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:35.680
like oh how was it received this week and so forth, so I kind of made a decision on

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.280
how we're going to kind of treat the YouTube thing going forward, so this is how it's going

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.360
to work is that we will post the episodes to YouTube, obviously there will not be video

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.680
so there's just going to be audio for archive purposes, we will post the shows to YouTube

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.120
but we're going to post them on a one week delay and you might be thinking like what,

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.360
why would you do that?

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.920
Well because I love the idea of like YouTube for like the archive purposes and so forth

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.040
and kind of being able to go find your favorite parts of the show and so forth and all that

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:07.600
but I'm going to just keep it real with you guys, we want the hits at OrangeOnTrader.com

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.440
and BogNetwork.com, I mean YouTube is great for discovery and so forth and branching out

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:19.480
to that audience but it really helps us in being able to you know get into, sell the

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:26.440
show as media and help with events and so forth if we can get the hits with OrangeOnTrader.com

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:32.400
and so forth so the podcast and Stitcher and TuneIn and those sorts of apps that tap into

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.120
the official podcast feed, those are the ways we sort of prefer that people listen to the

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.260
show so those are the ones that we're going to support with the immediate Sunday night

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:47.180
uploads but we will continue to support YouTube on the delay, I will say this though just

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:51.840
so that if you're like a YouTube dedicated person I don't want you to get upset because

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.060
definitely we're exploring what are other ways we can actually get involved with actual

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:59.780
video on YouTube, I know I've been doing that a lot through my own channel, plug plug Rob

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:05.340
Roberts Plays, plug plug and I'm sure there will be more stuff to come in the future so

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:09.680
stay tuned for you know things that aren't just audio archives of the show and hopefully

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:15.300
some more interactive content over on the YouTube. Alright let's get into some gaming

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.800
news, we're going to try to move through it quickly because we're already an hour twenty

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.400
minutes into the show but we'll try to get through this quickly, Loki why don't you start

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:27.280
us off with some news tonight. Alright so as we mentioned last week there have been

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:33.800
some people using Playroom on the Playstation 4 as a means to kind of broadcast themselves

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:40.520
almost like a talk show format or whatever and some people have been abusing that to

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:46.640
broadcast themselves doing pornographic things which I'm personally fine with but apparently

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:54.360
Twitch isn't so because of that Twitch has momentarily removed the Playroom content from

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:59.360
the directory because they say the majority of it was non-gaming related and they may

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:08.320
add it back later on if you know the gameplay stuff is more gaming related later on I guess

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:15.800
I don't know so oh well it's all it takes is a few people to run it for everybody. This

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.680
is I mean there was a part of me that was like oh that's so frustrating I mean it's

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.720
not that I'm like sitting here going oh Twitch shouldn't have done that I mean they kind

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:28.160
of had to because people were you know abusing it or whatever but I was just like damn it

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.400
really sucks that there wasn't a way to really kind of manage that and I don't know what

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:38.520
you could do I mean it's the whole infamous TTP joke we make here on Orange Lawns Radio

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.240
where you put a new peripheral out there and what's the time to penis how long before somebody

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.240
puts their dick in it or shows their dick on it or so forth. Or draws a dick. Exactly

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:52.800
as we found with this it wasn't very long at all and that's why it's you know gotten

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.040
pulled and so forth there were some really disgusting things that were going on on Playroom

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:59.200
like I'm not I'm not just talking about like showing body parts there's really disgusting

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.560
things happening. Yeah I saw them. So yeah well so I understand completely why they pulled

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.760
it but damn it because there was some great potential there for people to start their

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.800
own homegrown broadcasts and get voices out there and so forth I guess you could still

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:18.600
you do that on Ustream so I would encourage you if you were one of those people that was

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:24.860
like shit I could have used Playroom to start my podcast or to start my video show don't

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:29.180
let that discourage you completely you could feasibly still do Ustream it's gonna be a

01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:33.780
little harder to build an audience but you know what you gotta start somewhere. Or you

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:38.940
could probably get drivers for that camera eventually and. Yeah that'll happen too. I

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:43.820
don't know I think that has a special adapter for it though or a special like proprietary

01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:48.420
plug or something but you know they'll come out with something I mean they did it with

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:52.860
you know with the Kinect and stuff so that and honestly it doesn't probably cost too

01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:58.780
much to get you know some sort of webcam and a lot of computers have webcams built

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:03.780
into them or even laptops and stuff so you know I wouldn't say you can afford a you know

01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:07.740
PlayStation 4 you probably could afford a you know a webcam if you really wanted to

01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:12.980
do that. Yeah so yeah and I'm all for more voices more broadcasting getting out there

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:18.420
so just you know kind of on a side note but damn you people that had to go do nasty shit

01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:25.980
on Playroom and really ruin it for everybody. Jerks. Alright moving on some changes going

01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:30.060
on with Miiverse and this has to do with the integration between the 3DS is gonna be coming

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:34.540
on board and they're getting Miiverse so there's been some changes with Miiverse that happened

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:39.820
this past week and obviously this is to support this whole consolidation. Some new display

01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:44.220
options in the community list you can display more communities at once there's also gonna

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:49.300
be communities based on categories like Wii U software, Virtual Console and assumably

01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:55.500
3DS and so on. Your profile will no longer display the total number of YAS you've given

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:59.580
which was basically how many inches your Nintendo E-peen was was right there on your profile

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:03.500
like how many people have clicked like on my post that's not there anymore so there's

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:10.100
no more competition I suppose. You can still see your YAS on individual posts. Also the

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:14.460
default display setting in the community when you entered the community before you

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:20.080
would see everybody's posts. Now it defaults to only showing you posts from people who've

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:25.980
actually played the game. You can take that out and look at every post if you want to

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:29.980
but I kind of understand that change. I do. You want the discussion to be people who've

01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:33.860
actually played the game. It's unfortunate for the people who might be popping in there

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:38.540
to ask is this you know would I like this game but there's other places on the internet

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:44.120
you can go for that really. The Miiverse integration of Mario 3D World is a lot of

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:50.180
fun though. I really crack up at some of the stuff I see. Miiverse is so interesting. Just

01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:54.260
when you think Nintendo really doesn't understand online whatsoever you kind of look at Miiverse

01:28:54.260 --> 01:29:00.700
and go nobody's really doing that and it is kind of neat like when it works. Anyway one

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:04.780
other thing that is neat to be a part of if you're lucky enough to be there you might

01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:09.060
actually get a free Wii U console if you end up on the right Southwest Airlines flight.

01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:13.460
Yeah a Southwest Airlines flight. Apparently Nintendo and Southwest Airlines partnered

01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:18.720
up. Nintendo is like the official video game company of Southwest Airlines. There's gaming

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:23.020
lounges in some of the heavy traffic Southwest airports which would be what like Las Vegas

01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:29.300
I imagine has got to have something and they're giving away games and so forth and Flight

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:35.860
1883 which went from New Orleans to Dallas Love Field last week they gave over 100 passengers

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:40.020
a brand new Wii U console. So it's just kind of different ways to I mean we might be sitting

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:42.980
here looking at that going that's kind of weird but it's just marketing it's just different

01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:47.940
ways to market you know. Sony's doing something about PS4 on Facebook so yeah one of their

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:53.220
those reblog campaigns. Yeah they gave away two of them at the Sharks game last night.

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:58.940
So you know and I'm sure an Xbox they they went to some YouTubers houses and were giving

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:03.700
them Xbox. Some of their vocal critics were giving them Xbox ones. Francis was the one

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:08.260
that saw one. Apparently they're not listening to our show. I know right. That was the only

01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:12.340
reason you were so mad. Loki you were just trying to get a free one. I'm not mad at all.

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:18.420
Like I said I'm not going to turn down free but you know. Anyway so yeah Fly More Southwest

01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:23.660
I suppose if you want to possibly win a free Wii U. That's a good excuse to go Southwest

01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:28.060
as your airline. I don't know what. The most entertaining flights I've ever had were Southwest

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:33.440
flights. That's true. Let's just go to Disneyland a bunch. Well see I do not not again we're

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.620
not commercially endorsed but I do have to give JetBlue a shout out because I do love

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:42.380
those TVs because I flew cross country and watched five hours of SpongeBob SquarePants.

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:47.420
Best flight best flight ever took to New York City. That sounds awful. For the record. Haters

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:52.520
gonna hate. For the record. What. Crap what was it. It wasn't Delta. It was something

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:59.640
I when I flew to Alabama. Seriously the worst thing ever. It was US air I'm sure. Oh American

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:06.480
American Airlines. Awful. All right. What do you have for us. I have some crap because

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:15.300
this is a bunch of crap. So once again Shenmue three ain't happening. That whole trademark

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:24.400
application. Fake. Sega's like no. Didn't we tell you this for the last ten years. No.

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.340
Now I think there's a silver lining to this we'll get into later in the show but there's

01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:35.100
another fake too. Go ahead. For a Fallout 4. Well it's gonna happen eventually. We all

01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:39.660
know Fallout 4 is going to happen. But the one that's up right now has like a fake trailer

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:45.280
and everything and it's no. So and you know there's been a ton of this with Blizzard related

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:49.920
products to a fake trademark. So you know I think the lesson we all need to learn from

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:55.760
these various fake trademark stories. Stop running with articles. Just stop on trade.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:02.720
Just stop. But trademarks don't mean anything anymore. So trademarks patents stop. Yeah

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:08.040
probably something else too. IMDB pages. Stop. Yes stop. All of it. Not news sources. These

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:12.120
are no longer credible news sources done. You're saying 4chan's not a reliable news

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:19.320
source. I hate to offend but you know I just. In places I think to go for gaming news that's

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:24.720
not really at the top of the list. Biting gaming commentary perhaps but not for gaming

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:30.640
news. For the record SpongeBob is the devil. Whatever. Hater. He's not the devil he's too

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:36.760
dumb to be the devil. Alright. I seriously tried to watch that episode an episode of

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:41.240
that and I thought I could feel my brain melting. It was awful. It's just fucking Ren and Simpy

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:45.600
under the sea. That's all it is. I mean Ren and Simpy was cool. Do you hate Adventure

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.160
Time too because that shows. No I love Adventure Time. I don't get you because I love Adventure

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:54.280
Time too. But I heard the game is not so great. A friend told me that the game is like it's

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:58.520
only fun if you have like multiplayer but like a single player it's the why why are

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.560
we in the dungeon. I don't know or whatever that game is called. I've heard it's great

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:06.760
for multiplayer but for single players. I almost picked it up. Yeah. Yeah. If we find

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:13.240
it on sale we should do a multiplayer. I found a used copy. Just tell me which system you

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:18.000
guys get it on and I'll bug my D3 rep to give me a copy because he loves me so. How about

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.480
you get three copies. Yeah I don't think that's gonna work. Or four Jason wants one too. Alright

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.240
let's travel around the world and check out release dates. There might not be a lot but

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:31.120
we'll try anyway. Release dates. This is easy because I already memorized this one. There's

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.480
only one game coming out this week and that's Gran Turismo 6 and it's on Friday. Nice. On

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:42.160
PlayStation 3. Lots of cars. Pretty big. Pretty big game. Yeah. We don't have to wait three

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:48.240
years. Alright and so it will actually be happening. Now how can we prove to Bobby Blackwolf

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.520
that the game will actually be coming out because he doesn't think Gran Turismo 5 ever

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.600
happened. This is actually happening. It hasn't been delayed. They announced it was coming

01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:05.440
out you know quarter four 2013 and we're in quarter four 2013 no delays so we're all good.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:09.920
So what we need to do is we need everybody to go to like you know your local game store

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:13.760
wherever it is when you see Gran Turismo 6 sitting on the shelf you need to take a picture

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:23.120
of it and put it on Twitter. Hashtag believe me Bobby. And and you can drive on the moon.

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:28.760
Get the fuck out. You can drive on the moon. You can drive on the moon. Is it moon patrol?

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.200
No they have a moon you have a moon lander that you can drive and there's actual achievements

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.060
for driving on the moon. If you can have aliens and Bill Clinton in a hot tub at the end of

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:44.560
Cruise and World then you know. Alright going to Japan you have a little more to look forward

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:48.840
to this week. Gran Turismo 6 is there as well but there's some other games as well. Metal

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:54.300
Gear Rising Revengeance gets a special edition on the PlayStation 3. Daikokai Jidai Online

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:59.760
Gran Atlas is released this week. Kaihu Shoujo Sin in regular and limited edition also this

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:05.240
week and there are Gran Turismo 6 PlayStation 3 bundles this week so if you're in Japan you've

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:09.240
been holding out on a PlayStation 3 and maybe this is the game that's going to do it for you

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:15.200
believe me Bobby it's out in Japan this week so there you go. Also the Walking Dead comes out in

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:22.120
Japan. Is this the I'm trying to look real quick oh this is the Telltale version the good one not

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:26.560
the crappy shooter this is the good Walking Dead comes out in Japan this week I imagine it must

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.000
finally have been localized and that's why it's just now getting released. Remember if it's

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.240
survival instinct use your instincts to not buy it. Yes absolutely no this is the good Walking Dead

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:41.120
coming out on PlayStation 3 this week in Japan. Going to the Xbox 360 Batman Arkham Origins on

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:49.160
360 this week also there's an Xbox 360 slim with a 320 gig hard drive being released this week I'm

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:53.880
not sure what that's in celebration of it just an excuse to get another 360 on the shelf I suppose.

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:59.960
On the Vita this week Batman Arkham Origins is there as well and there's a new lime green white

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.840
pink black and light blue white Vita's those those models are making their way out this week. Also

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:08.280
tear away which has been getting really good reviews over here I haven't played it myself

01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:14.520
yet but tear away finally gets its release on the Vita this week in Japan and looking at the Wii U

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:20.720
and the 3ds you have Batman Arkham Origins on Wii U also Dragon Quest 10 the which is the Dragon

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.640
Quest online this must be some type of price reduction oh no it's the Wii U version because

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:29.680
it was originally out on Wii so the Wii U version finally makes its entrance to Japan this week and

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:35.320
all those of us in America are just sitting here going when do we get a turn and the answer may be

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:40.880
never unfortunately but on the Nintendo 3ds bravely default for the sequel Geist Crusher

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:50.560
Inazuma 11 Go Galaxy Big Bang and Galaxy Supernova and some Hello Kitty purses and pouches four

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:56.680
your 3ds LL or XL but LL Japan are released this week because you know you want a my melody pouch

01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:03.320
in pink or red. No I want a Duffy case give me a Duffy case for my DS. Stay tuned all right those

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:06.760
are the releases in Japan so much busier week in Japan than here in the States how about the UK?

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:13.680
A little busier on the fourth we have dark out for PC on the fifth Space Hulk on iPad Speedball

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:22.120
2 HD steamworld dig for Mac and PC and bravely default for the sequel on 3ds and then on the

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:29.160
sixth the Scribblenauts Unlimited for 3ds and Wii U. All right just a few more stories for you guys

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:36.920
than the classic game of the week but first Loki. I just realized that Just Cause 2 multiplayer is

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:42.560
coming back or is coming to steam that's fucking awesome so seriously buy Just Cause 2 if you

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:48.160
haven't already because it's like two bucks multiplayer without but like the thousand people

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:55.600
at a time. You're given an awful lot of endorsements tonight. Dude it's a it's a sandbox game with guns

01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:03.840
and vehicles and stuff and grappling hooks with a thousand people at one time. I mean come on that

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:08.640
sounds fucking awesome. Granted that should have been especially with grappling hooks. Anyways

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:20.320
so Microsoft of course you know they're gonna be launching the Xbox one in Japan later on in 2014

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:29.120
and to go along with that they are teaming up with some developers or Japanese developers to be exact

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:35.680
to offer some games that may be exclusive to the Xbox one platform and of course those haven't

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:44.280
been revealed yet but they will be full Japanese games and not like you know digital games like

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:51.120
Panzer Dragoon or something like that and of course announcements coming later on about that

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:57.800
I'm not sure where they're supposed to announcement or you know announce all that stuff but soon

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:04.840
hopefully since I want to say they're launching in the spring I may be thinking PlayStation 3 but

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:12.680
I don't know that's kind of neat at least they're seems to be taking it kind of seriously you know

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:18.760
so maybe kind of a turnaround for what we saw in the 360 Microsoft really wants to get their foot

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:24.000
in Japan Japanese households maybe we'll see something like you know we saw with like Blue

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.920
Dragon and stuff like that you know maybe something along those lines I imagine too this is

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:33.280
timed because the Xbox one is not out in Japan but perhaps they're gonna start you know before it's

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.560
released there in 2014 they're gonna really start to get some of this news out here you know they

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:41.160
got there they have leveraged Square Enix to give them another Dragon Quest game maybe Dragon Quest

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.600
you know was it 11 11 or so maybe on 11 now because they're probably not gonna get 10 well

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:52.080
never say never you know and the end if Microsoft reverses its policies Microsoft could get Final

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:58.360
Fantasy 14 realm reborn too it's it's known that Square Enix wanted to do it for 360 and it's just

01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.960
Microsoft's the one that did not but they they will not budge on the cross servers thing that

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.320
and I I props to Square Enix for not budging on that so it'll be interesting if they can kind of

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:10.680
sit together at the table they did it for 11 they can do it for 14 that would be interesting very

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:18.160
interesting all right um also interesting of note news coming out of Japan Super Mario 3d world the

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:25.160
sales figures are in and well unfortunately it doesn't look great there's some conflicting

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:30.760
reports about how much it's sold media create says they sold just under a hundred thousand

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:36.800
units of Super Mario 3d world and for me too says it was about 107 K so either way you're looking at

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:43.920
about a hundred thousand sold here's the thing to put that into perspective Mario 3d land three

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:50.080
hundred and forty four thousand that's the 3ds one Super Mario Sunshine two hundred and eighty

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:54.880
thousand which you know of the modern games it seems like sunshine gets dumped on the most I

01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:02.160
just thrown it out there Super Mario 64 on the 3ds the remake hundred and twenty still sold more

01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:08.000
than Super Mario 3d world now I'm not saying this are those like lifetime sales or is that no first

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.440
week sales are all first week so oh no god oh all those games sold over a million except for

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:17.920
Sunshine actually didn't in Japan sunshine ended with seven hundred and eighty nine thousand and

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:22.480
change but here's the thing I don't want this to be like oh we're kicking Nintendo while they're

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:29.240
down or the sky is falling or whatever but I bring this up because you know I I you know Nintendo

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.840
ain't going bankrupt so stop those rumors and that shit survive the virtual boy they'll survive

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:39.200
this I was gonna mention the numbers are on VG charts for North America are they I didn't know

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:43.840
they were out yes they they're always a week behind but two hundred and forty three thousand

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:51.160
Wow okay so interesting not exactly a bust Europe did it come out over there in Europe let's see

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:59.560
here Europe mmm I guess it did not come out over there yet yeah that's a very interesting silver

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:03.920
lining is that it sold twice as many in the u.s. as it did in Japan that's very interesting it

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:08.760
more than twice hold on let's give me weird for dates here okay and then yeah they're saying 101

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:17.120
101 798 is in Japan I'm gonna check Europe again because give me a weird date oh they don't see

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:23.840
that's it they don't have last week they only have up to the 16th so the the problem that people are

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:28.400
really identifying with this is that you know for the install base of the Wii and this is important

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:31.880
to say for the install base that the Wii U has currently we all know that we use struggle in a

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:36.880
little bit it's no secret so for the install base at the Wii U has those numbers aren't bad but the

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:41.360
problem is is the game was expected to push more we use sales and that we're not seeing that really

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:47.400
happened in Japan yet again I think it's a little too early to say the sky is falling completely but

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:51.440
I think there are a lot of us that are rooting for Nintendo and and really hope they can turn

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:57.280
it around but it's gonna I really wish they had had a second game like this to really kick I mean

01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:02.520
they certainly have it on the 3ds but I wish they had a another game to kind of kick out the gate

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:07.920
this winner with this to really get people talking I guess you could say Zelda Wind Waker but again I

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:14.640
just something kind of new I don't know I I just to really push those Wii U units because I

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:19.480
definitely don't want to see Nintendo fail none of us do well that's the thing is I'm curious to

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:26.320
see what they're selling as far as you know we use systems because you know it's good that they

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:31.680
sold those games but I'm sure that they have more than 200,000 we you know we use systems out there

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:38.040
and I just be curious to see how that's actually translating to new sales you know what a very

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.440
interesting point in our chat room at live dot vog network comm made by dungeon buster who says

01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:47.560
lightning returns also sold considerably less than its release window in Japan when compared

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:53.440
to Final Fantasy 13 2 which was lower in opening sales than Final Fantasy 13 it just sounds like

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:59.320
the sales were soft for titles in general in Japan and that legends all linked between worlds

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:07.360
294,000 and that's that's like you know that's through the 23rd that's day one sales yeah not

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:13.880
surprised that I games amazing um and SG 100 Matt says the game came out at a bad time with all the

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:19.080
new consoles coming out now not Japan though remember Japan didn't have a PlayStation 4 and

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:24.120
Xbox one till next year but Xbox one no but it was still imminent for the PlayStation well

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:28.100
Nintendo's kind of competing against themselves in a way in Japan right now with 3ds I mean sure

01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:33.920
Sony's trying to up the presence with a Vita and it's you know it's somewhat working but Nintendo's

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:39.560
biggest enemy in a way is a 3ds gaming on the go don't underestimate how huge gaming on the go is

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:44.640
over there I mean obviously considering all the devices that you kids are all distracting yourselves

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:53.440
with right now clearly well not this week but to your credit you don't have Animal Crossing right

01:44:53.440 --> 01:45:01.200
now I didn't even consider my purse and I have Zelda plugged in right now actually I know yeah

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:06.720
go ahead I should log in you should should open the gate no I I definitely agree with that point

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:12.480
that it's trending mobile and when you're trying to hold on to uh you know like the same the same

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:18.200
issue with PC desktops and everything else these long these older inflexible yeah they may have

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:24.400
more features but you cannot play them anywhere else without difficulty you're right mobile is

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:31.800
the up-and-comer and it will be biting sales in out from a lot of other things all right well

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:37.240
we'll see I mean again week one let's let's see how this game does through the holiday season we'll

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:43.320
see but it could be very interesting to see what this is gonna have Nintendo doing in 2014 but you

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:48.480
know what it's not over it ain't over all right uh let's move on you know what let's move back to a

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:54.160
classic time when we didn't fucking stress on how well a game sold because we didn't find out for

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.240
like three months because we got all our news from magazines I want to know what's up with Jason's

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:07.080
monkey hat you're talking about on the 3ds right yes well let's let's travel back to a time when

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:11.120
we were getting our news from magazines and we were playing classic video games on classic

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:15.720
consoles back when the Nintendo that was on the block was the Super Nintendo it's a classic game

01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:19.960
of the week y'all where dark soccer jumps into the vault picks the game that she thinks hey you

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:25.640
should be playing this why cuz it's rad tonight's pick definitely rad dark soccer which picked me

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:30.520
I picked marble madness just because I had that stupid level two music stuck in my head doo doo

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:35.880
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo never pick this game before it's so good I

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:44.160
was never a superfan of marble madness because it pisses me off sorry very loud dongs from from

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:50.200
marble manas sorry guys but the best music was the level two music for the record at any rate

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:58.920
it was designed by Mark Kearney and it came out in 1984 it was an arcade game it was being it was

01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:03.080
one of the most innovative games when it came out it used the Atari system one hardware and

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:10.520
programmed in C one of the first games to be programmed in NC on the hardware it was also the

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:19.080
first to use true stereo sound previous ones use simulated stereo or mono so this one basically in

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:25.040
fact I'm actually just gonna pull this quote right here it was the designer drew inspiration from

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:31.880
mini golf racing games and MC Escher which we can totally see where that came from so basically the

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:38.800
way you play marble madness is you are a little marble and you work your marble through a mazes

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:46.080
of different kind but you use a trackball although home versions used different controllers with

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:52.920
directional pads which is probably why I hated playing it on the nest so yeah you have a different

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:58.280
you know you can do practice each one has a theme there's even like a backwards level where you go

01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:07.040
up instead of you know the usual down the course type of method the other thing with this one too

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:17.480
is that it was just a really freaking bizarre and neat game for its time I mean what was trying to

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:23.480
think of what the word I'm trying to think of for the perspective isometric thank you isometric

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:30.200
it uses an isometric perspective you're looking at it on diagonal it simulates a feeling of three

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.160
dimensions very nicely sorry I'm just watching this awesome bad I know right here on YouTube

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:39.560
and he's in that upside-down level right now and I'm just remembering what a mind fuck that level

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:44.040
was because like gravity goes the other way you just you don't know how mad bad that messes with

01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:51.920
you tell you play it oh yeah I mean the whole game was just such a neat game and I mean on top

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.560
this is an arcade when he's doing it with travel you have to play this game with a trackball if

01:48:55.560 --> 01:49:01.960
you want to play with any kind of accuracy I do believe actually have this on Atari 5200 I want

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:10.200
to say because we've got a trackball anyway um moving back into some of the background on the

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:16.040
game actually the guy who was working on this was supposed to be doing a video game version of

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:20.920
thriller Michael Jackson's thriller and it was canceled so they moved into Marvel madness this

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:28.680
particular one at his time was using a 19 inch CRT monitor and a Motorola 68 0 10 central

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:36.560
processing unit and it just basically was pretty tech heavy for its time I mean it was at the edge

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:46.160
so as far as other and there's actually there are whole just different has a programming tricks

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:55.600
that went in this game it did shadows to control anti aliasing it did a light ray tracing I mean

01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:01.120
the technology behind this game it's a programming Marvel for its time I mean to be honest there are

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:05.200
there's actually I believe the whole site full of nothing but concept sketches that went behind

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:12.800
this and the programming direction really neat stuff so it was a big commercial success there

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:18.200
were 4,000 cabinets sold and it was its highest-earning game in arcades at the time but

01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:26.080
then it fell after seven weeks and really it was because it's such a short game but it is still

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:33.920
people just got frustrated to hell there really the lot of thing is that because it was it took

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:40.680
such a high level of skill to play that's what made it really just an attractive game to have

01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:50.560
a game to play so with that too there were other versions and a potential sequel and I will go

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:57.000
ahead and put this out there I think that super monkey ball was definitely influenced by this

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:04.200
game easily so as far as other versions there was a tiger electronics handheld LCD game which

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:12.600
I had and rare released the Nintendo version there I mean they were all very simple they you

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:19.800
know weren't as great clearly as the arcade one other versions that came out were of Amiga Game

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:27.680
Boy Sega Mega Drive the spectrum PC and GBA just all kinds of different versions of course we've

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:32.920
seen the rereleases on more modern systems in the various Midway compilations and Williams

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:39.560
compilations there was an arcade sequel that was planned in 1991 called marble mad marble madness

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:48.600
2 it was in development by Kearney's partner for the first one Bob Flanagan but it just it was

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:56.520
supposed to expand have invisibility flight modes pinball games set in between the levels and three

01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:05.240
player isometric racing but it just didn't happen there were prototypes that were out for location

01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:12.040
testing but you know what it was going against at the time Street Fighter 2 and that was also in

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:17.880
testing at the time so yeah so they went off of that and went to guardians of the hood instead

01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:23.400
which is a beat-em-up game but there are the prototypes exist and you can find I'm sure you

01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:32.600
can find ROMs of them so I would love to see what people think about it but as far as I mean that

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:37.280
goes there were some spiritual successors to I mean I said you know super monkey ball kind of doing

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:44.400
the successor thing there were there was a Archer McLean's Mercury switch ball never ball marble

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:50.760
blast gold that's on Linux and Mac OS and Windows it came out in 2003 balance and I'm thinking that

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:58.200
because there's two elves in it just a different one so but nothing is the original nothing will

01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:04.440
piss you off and make you hit nothing will make you love you love a trackball and respect the

01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:09.800
trackball oh fuck yeah this this game is damn near impossible without a trackball I mean that's just

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:15.520
how it is so yeah marble madness but you have to play the level 2 music for me because I just

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:23.600
played it like five times yeah but I was talking you had so much to say about the game seriously

01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:27.840
like my favorite music and are you happy now I'll tell you the other thing I really like about this

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:34.000
is that it reminds me of Wendy what's-her-name that did the Tron music oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:40.920
because I've always loved that synth style just that them since exactly I love it so much so this

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:51.240
why can't I remember her last name now Wendy does it start with an O um Wendy Carlos Wendy Carlos

01:53:51.240 --> 01:54:00.680
okay it's CEO it's an arched letter um yeah it made me think a lot of Wendy Carlos music well

01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:04.400
I mean it came out two years after Tron so I could definitely see they're being influenced

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:08.760
in the music and even that grid style if you notice the colors and some of the levels in

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:15.080
that style it I see some Tron influence so all right there it is your classic game of the week

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:20.600
marble madness definitely a classic and you can certainly find that in collections like I think

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:26.920
that midway game I had on the ps3 for a little bit had that in it but again you know thumbstick

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:33.360
versus trackball not the same sorry to say there's another successor that she didn't mention I'm

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.640
pretty sure I even called into all our about this like five years ago because a buddy of

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:44.400
mine had a copy of this and I've never played it since and I really want to called Cora Reimpa

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:54.720
marble mania exclusive you play the game I think it was Mario Galaxy or Mario Galaxy 2 when when

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.880
your character jumps on like a big bowling ball and goes down a track what the game tells you to

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.320
do is take the wiimote and put the bottom in the palm of your hand and treat it like a you know an

01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:10.280
arcade stand of joystick kind of thing Cora Reimba uses that control method exactly and I forgot

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:15.000
about Cora Reimba risingly fun I actually have that dandy I have that game it is totally a

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:21.440
marble madness biting but it's great great I need to play this game again all right well you can if

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.480

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:22.840
been a really fun show so far we had Matt Connor on earlier I'm talking about his Kickstarter for

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:29.400
read-only memories and gamer acts and that was a really fun interview we were just talking about

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.320

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:45.760
a gym oh yeah Fantasia you were you were saying something about where's that Xbox one game

01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:20.840
going on what Nintendo did with the Wii Sports remake but yeah that's been delayed I think it

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:27.360
was delayed just because there's a big gap in titles coming out like I said you know after this

01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:36.760

01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:38.660
dyad is also gonna be coming to play free as well I haven't died I remember hearing about the game

01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:44.340
but I don't remember what it is exactly but it's supposed to be good and then I think that was the

01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:52.580
one that's supposed to be sort of like like geometry Wars maybe I'm trying to look it up

01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:59.820
real quick because it's one psychedelic racer it sounds familiar to me too it's a tunnel racing

01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:04.660
puzzle shooting game is what they call it okay well then it's nothing like geometry Wars it

01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:09.260
sounds cool though I like that description I'll check that out ah then for Vita Sonic and all

01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:18.620
or Sonic and all-stars racing transform for the Vita and urban trial freestyle pretty awesome so

01:59:18.620 --> 01:59:28.660
that's coming out and then to be fair I think on the Xbox Friday no it Gears of War is gonna be one

01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:34.140
of the free games I don't remember the Xbox Live Arcade title that's also with that though

01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:47.420
but yeah Gears of War one coming and then Saints Row 4 getting some DLC pretty soon actually I

01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:54.180
think next week or on the 11th and they're gonna have to save Santa Claus from the simulation so

01:59:54.180 --> 02:00:00.220
how the Saints save Christmas and then we'll come with the course as I predicted a Christmas themed

02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:12.380
dubstep gun and then a bunch of other you know things reindeer jingle bells jingle so pretty

02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:20.820
much yeah it's part of the season pass or $6.99 if you wait until December I will have you know

02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:26.100
though if you do buy the season pass I think right now it's on sale for 66% off it's like

02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:33.300
five bucks right now or you know on Steam so it might be worth picking up if you're curious I

02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:45.260
guess okay Jason I got it you ready you ready come they told me pa wub wub wub huh that's good

02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:52.540
that was good I'm gonna put out an album sort of God wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub

02:00:53.260 --> 02:01:02.860
and then some great news and definitely coming very soon in December we will see the final

02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:09.860
PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto game coming to mobile Grand Theft Auto San Andreas getting an

02:01:09.860 --> 02:01:17.860
improved I believe it like slightly HD version that'll be coming out not sure when but sometime

02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:24.220
this month supposed to be on iOS and Android and Windows mobile of course limited devices

02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:28.500
are gonna be able to run it but fuck man San Andreas is like one of the best PlayStation 2

02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:34.740
era Grand Theft Auto games and that's just all sorts of awesome now I hope that that means now

02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:39.780
that they have all these sort of HD a fied Grand Theft Auto games that we get some sort of triple

02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:46.100
pack for like Xbox Live arcade or something like that that would be amazing because it fucking

02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:55.340
sucks to play those games on using the touchscreen although Grand Theft Auto Vice City in think three

02:01:55.340 --> 02:02:00.420
did run on the Uya so you may be able to sideload this on the Uya which then you'll have like a

02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:10.620
PlayStation 2 sort of oh all right moving on some more stories here I know we had a lot of persona

02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:15.140
news last week because you know they're teasing persona 5 and so forth but who cares about that

02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:20.220
when there's persona for dancing all night that's right the persona music action game that's the

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:26.140
one you're most excited about let's get real it is being developed by Atlas and the co-developer

02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:34.460
of Hatsune Miku project diva dingo awesome the game will take place after persona for the Ultimax

02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:40.660
ultra suplex hold and Tetsuya Kimura and Daisuke Asakura and some other musicians will be doing

02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:44.740
the background music for the game some of the games in the game will include pursuing my true

02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:49.780
self heaven reach out to the truth time to make history and true story which were all songs that

02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:55.420
were in persona 4 and persona 4 golden so awesome now the song list is starting to take shape so I

02:02:55.420 --> 02:03:00.860
know you persona fans and you music game fans are gonna be in heaven with that if you like your

02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:08.180
classic games like me you're probably excited to hear about this jump man I well ironically one of

02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:13.100
the games I or the game I did for my very totally because you did that I know right right my first

02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:17.500
let's remember video we'll get this the game developer apparently resurrecting jump man is

02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:25.660
located in Wichita where Shane Alinko is mind blown something gaming is happening in Wichita go

02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:32.260
figure but yeah which I game developers name is Davis sickman jr. now he raised he's raising some

02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:38.820
money with a Kickstarter to try to revive the jump man games for iPhone iPad Android PC Mac and

02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:45.140
Ouya so that's pretty cool jump man of course originally created by Randy Glover for the Atari

02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:51.500
and the old-school PCs and Commodore 64 the initial version had 30 levels and so on and so

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:57.980
on so yeah that would be cool there was a jump man resurrection project planned around 2000 when

02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:03.040
they secured the rights to do sequels but it didn't really come to be I guess there was jump

02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:07.980
man 2049 but it didn't it didn't really happen but thanks to Kickstarter jump man forever

02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:14.620
could be a thing nothing ever works out 2049 what if they did a crossover game that was doodle

02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:20.700
jump man there's there's potential you never know all right you know there's a lot of potential in

02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:26.100
the awesome game typing of the dead overkill heck yes this game is a lot of fun I played it again

02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:33.060
with speaking of Shane in Wichita played this online this past week and the one thing we didn't

02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:38.260
get to do unfortunately was try the brand new DLC that was released this week the Shakespeare DLC

02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:45.020
pack that's right for $3 you can get all the typing in the game changed to lines as to thine

02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:52.300
oh self quintessence of dust and bellows mender so you can you can actually type we get the line

02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:56.620
about the bunghole from Hamlet anything is possible dark soccer you know what a bunghole

02:04:56.620 --> 02:05:03.980
is right for real no I I have heard it in the Shakespearean context yeah it is the hole on a

02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:12.220
keg mm-hmm now you know as opposed to the hole on your keg anyway uh-huh that's all I got dark

02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:21.660
Sakura dang it I was actually looking at the email um well there is a website now open for

02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:27.300
the Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary so you can go look at it I'm sure you can just hunt it down by

02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:34.100
going to work you know looking up Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary site but it has some teasing on

02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:46.860
there too what could it be we don't know moving forward um Atlas is basically free to look at

02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:52.600
any of Sega's old IPs any of their dormant ones so you know that could be Panzer Dragoon that could

02:05:52.600 --> 02:06:02.340
be Jet Set Radio that could be Shenmue so who knows or it could just be Streets of Rage by the

02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:07.620
way there's that silver lining I mentioned earlier yeah Shenmue they should make a spin-off game where

02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:17.580
the main character is a cow and they call it Shenmue okay so and then now this I actually sat

02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:23.820
and watch freaking footage from his two hours watching this thing today and this one I'm gonna

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:31.140
go ahead and just give the link to this is on shoryuken.com Ultra Street Fighter IV

02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:41.980
is at Super Arcade in Walnut California and it is basically location testing but there is a two

02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:48.740
hour just play of some of the different characters that are in it we have T-Hawk we have Rolando we

02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:58.260
have Elena, Makoto and Poison I was very actually very happily surprised at just how much more

02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:05.340
balanced some of the gameplay seems in it but you can watch the footage there's link following

02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:14.740
from shoryuken.com so go look at it all right awesome lots of I would I would think this would

02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:18.540
be a dead period for gaming news but we still got a lot of good stuff going on out there let's get

02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:31.140
to the foogle question of the week you take Facebook and you take Google Plus you slam those

02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:35.660
words together you get boogle and it's our foogle question of the week posted on both our communities

02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:40.740
over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and our Google Plus community at google.com slash

02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:45.820
plus orange lounge radio all one word or you know what if you put orange lounge radio on Google

02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:51.780
you'll find it it comes right up anyway um I'm only gonna be able to read a couple I'm trying to

02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:55.780
buy us back some time since our interview went long but with great reason it was great interview

02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:59.620
but I'm gonna try to buy back some time here so I'm not gonna read a lot of answers but I really

02:07:59.620 --> 02:08:04.060
want to encourage you to read because there were some great answers to this so here it is earlier

02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:10.340
this week one popular web blog for Apple fans made the claim quote while the previous game console

02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:15.060
generation was all about motion controls it's clear that the new machines will use second

02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:20.700
functionality and apps as major weapons of war and that was a quote from the unofficial Apple

02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:27.460
web blog or tuaw.com now that all the triple-a players are on the field what do you feel was

02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:32.220
the majority theme of the last generation what might the theme of the next generation be more

02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:39.560
motion second screens VR AR more 3d and so on and fact you guys may not have known this question

02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:43.540
today coming from Jason actually invented this question Jason you want to elaborate on this at

02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:48.860
all before I read some of the answers um just nothing nothing terribly to elaborate on I just

02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:53.280
don't think that second screen is gonna wind up making any sort of a significant dent I think the

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:58.940
apps are getting better and they're going to exist but as far as that being as far as that being this

02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:04.660
year's motion that's not gonna be nearly all it's cracked up to be all right well let's look at some

02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:09.100
of the answers again I've really got to abbreviate this tonight please please please go read the

02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:13.520
responses in focus are some great ones including this one on Google Plus from Colin M who says

02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:20.480
last-gen felt like the me to generation the we introduced motion controls and Sony was like me

02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:25.680
too with the six axis Microsoft at least tried something new with the Kinect I think that I just

02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:32.040
gotta say I really like that answer because I mean for real because I mean I haven't read the second

02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:38.120
half yet but I was like you know what damn if that ain't right it does feel like everybody was kind

02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.440
of stealing the good ideas from each other not necessarily a bad thing that's just competition

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:50.720
but you'd like I I couldn't I couldn't go back to like even the PlayStation one and Sega's you

02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:55.640
know Saturn Aaron and and talk about like that was a me to generation it really wasn't optical

02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:00.280
media yeah I mean but that that who a new format which is that's not really above and better of all

02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:06.320
the cartridges ever that's not me too in the way that that e3 a couple years ago when they debuted

02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:10.680
the Kinect and the Sony move you're sitting there going wow they're just they're just after

02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:15.600
Nintendo's weave aren't they so you know is very interesting anyway let me read the rest of Colin's

02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:20.200
answer here on Google Plus I think the defining feature of this new gen will be social interaction

02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:25.720
both the Xbox one and PlayStation 4 have activity feeds a la Facebook to show you what your friends

02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:30.880
are doing even the Wii U has that Plaza of sorts then they're sharing videos of the games and live

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:35.400
streaming seamless multiplayer experiences such as watchdogs will blur the line between single

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:41.360
player and multiplayer gaming this next gen will be all about other people Jason you made a motion

02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:46.240
like I agree that sir that's exactly what my prediction for this generation is gonna be is

02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:54.560
that last year was better graphics denser media mostly and motion controls yes and and except in

02:10:54.560 --> 02:11:00.440
the case of we mostly cementing the online marketplace and online interactivity there is

02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:08.920
I have a very strong feeling that this generation also in PC land is going to be not just developing

02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:15.960
a title updating it and moving on but it's going to be social more socially geared with your friends

02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:23.080
but also gaming communities do you know how much new Borderlands 2 content that it there is do you

02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:29.440
know how much new Diablo content there is there's like all of these games are geared with the

02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:35.760
ability of with the capability of tacking new content on continuously in my opinion micro tracks

02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:40.680
and microtransactions be damned it's kind of a really good thing because they're going to extend

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:45.680
the lives of games and keep changing it in significant ways all right let's go to one more

02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:50.920
answer from Google Plus from Travis H who says 3d makes my head hurt motion control frustrates

02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:55.840
me it makes me break a sweat I'm almost positive VR would make me throw up so let's stick to buttons

02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:00.160
gripping and movie quality storylines and gameplay that pushes the limits of what we have already

02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:05.840
seen or felt so far as for second screen bring it on I love how well the Vita and ps3 play together

02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:10.680
can't wait to get my ps4 love my Wii U and the new PlayStation app they added is a great step

02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:15.680
in the right direction for Sony so instead of mobile's attempt to take over consoles let's

02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:22.320
make a baby and I'll get along so that is Travis's prediction for you let's make a baby and I'll get

02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:27.200
along love it those answers from Google Plus but there's about six other answers there if you want

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:35.280
to check that out we can call it the X for you going to Facebook let's read some answers here

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:39.480
on Facebook you know I I might be being partial here but I really like this answer from extra firm

02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:45.040
our buddy from courthouse extra over on Facebook says I think smartphone integration is definitely

02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:49.920
the theme of this console generation whether it's second screen experience or having companion apps

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.120
for your games I think that's what it's about heck even Nintendo has branched out and made

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:59.000
Miiverse available on smartphones I think this is the major companies doing their part to not

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:04.620
compete with mobile phones but to show that they can adapt to them let's make a baby right let's

02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:10.400
read another answer here from Ricardo V who says I don't think the last generation was about motion

02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:14.960
controls maybe the marketing makes it look that way because it was the new thing but at the end

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:20.160
I think it was more about giving a cinematic feel to games lots of scripted events animations of

02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:24.240
characters with the environment issue played etcetera clear examples of that are games like

02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:29.840
Uncharted The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite I still don't have a new console but I think we

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:34.720
started seeing what the new gen is about in the previous gen integration of indie games into the

02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:41.600
consoles multitasking and cloud and digital content good answer I like I like that too and

02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:47.480
certainly even though I think you saw it a little bit with PlayStation 2 just that when you talk

02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:51.320
about cinematic feel like certainly the budgets are starting to get up there where it's like you

02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:55.720
are but you're making three movies when you make a video game you know just just with what goes into

02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:00.880
it so I I definitely think that took off and especially those games you cited there let's do

02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:06.440
one more answer from Facebook I'm gonna do this one from Andy R who said I think the theme of this

02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:11.320
generation will be connectivity by that I mean games that might have been mostly single-player

02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:16.240
games in the past that are now offering incentive to connect to the internet to evolve the game

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:22.520
world we saw the beginnings of it with games like Dark Souls or Demon Souls or Journey we're playing

02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:27.480
the game online could change or enhance the gameplay experience now with games like Watch Dogs

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:33.040
or destiny the theme seems to be continuing again those are some of the answers from Facebook and

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:37.080
Google Plus please check out all the great diverse answers and it's never too late to add your own

02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:41.960
as well it's not like we close it down and and we read pretty much everything that's posted at

02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:46.320
least to ourselves and we like seeing the diverse opinions and see what comes back on the show later

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:50.480
that later on we're gonna get back into some long-form news but if you have more thoughts

02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:56.240
on this topic mailbag at orange laundry comms a great place to send it to Loki I was gonna say

02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:00.640
also yeah I definitely don't think motion control was I think problem with motion control and this

02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:05.840
is even gonna be something going into next-gen with connect and stuff is just it's a gimmick

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:14.360
it's just like remember when they had the vision camera yeah it's a gimmick that sold more copies

02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:19.760
of Wii Sports than any other video I'm not saying that we did it wrong we had the right idea because

02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:24.200
their whole console is based on that in the beginning and you know that was fine and that

02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:30.960
worked I'm talking about the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 it did not work it was a fad and I

02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.760
honestly think did you just make a pro Nintendo statement versus the other two I've always said

02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:42.840
just I'm just saying it's just funny anyways um so I think the same to me you said with the second

02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:46.800
screen stuff is I think it's just a big old gimmick that you know it's definitely something

02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:51.200
Microsoft's pushing because they want that second screen to be a fucking surface you know so of

02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:56.720
course they're gonna try to push that or a Windows Phone or some shit I just don't think it's

02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:00.800
something that we're gonna see implemented well into games you may get a couple games that

02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:04.760
implement it well but aside from that I mean it's just like what they've done to connect its voice

02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:11.680
commands for shit or it's FIFA detecting that you're cursing so they can fly you why the fuck

02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:20.640
would you want that I just don't know why anyone would want that anyways um okay so let's talk a

02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:26.280
little bit about the Xbox one since I mentioned connect you may remember last week we talked a

02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:32.080
little bit about how the Xbox one had some issues with some of the consoles that hey there was disk

02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:36.920
drive sounding like that it was shredding the disk you know at least that's what it sounded like

02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:42.200
and it was an issue and I said you know they really should come out and address the issue

02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:46.240
and figure out a way to you know piece customers and so that so that's what they did they went

02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:50.880
ahead and said you know what they're gonna replace the console what's kind of great about it is if

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:56.760
you call in and say hey you know my consoles all fucked up what they're gonna do is give you a free

02:16:56.760 --> 02:17:02.880
digital version of one the Xbox one launch title so either forza rice in a room dead rising three

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:09.560
or zoo tycoon and you get to keep your console until the replacement console arrives and you

02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:16.120
send the replacement console back so I thought that's a pretty decent way to make up for those

02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:21.840
drive issues and I haven't heard too much more about it this week so I'm assuming that it was

02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:28.040
indeed a very small number of consoles that were affected by it well thank God that it's not so

02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:33.560
widespread because I think that they learned the lesson the last time yeah they think I want to

02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:40.240
make that mistake again yeah no kidding well this could get very interesting could EA be working on

02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:45.680
an open-world Star Wars game so what yeah some recent job listings apparently point to this which

02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:50.320
of course makes me raise an eyebrow and go but I thought they already had a Star Wars MMO called

02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:56.800
the Old Republic but perhaps something new to tie in with the new games or maybe not even necessarily

02:17:56.800 --> 02:18:03.320
an MMO but an animation director being hired for EA Canada for quote a major new next-gen

02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:08.960
open-world action game in a beloved sci-fi property sounds like battle friend to me you

02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:13.960
maybe hmm there's also an executive producer British position in a lead combat designer

02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:19.340
position which apparently was also linked to a Star Wars property because a recruiter said

02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:25.420
something on Twitter I don't know but anyway apparently this goes back to when avalanche

02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:31.180
studios was working with Lucas are almost signed up with Lucas arts to do an open-world Star Wars

02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:38.020
game around 2007 oh my god that would have been so amazing and then you guys remember Star Wars 1313

02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:42.620
that was something that was Disney candidate if you didn't know Disney closed developer that

02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:47.380
halted the game could that be the game that's being picked up and continued question mark who

02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:53.100
knows EA of course has the exclusive rights to develop and continue the Star Wars games so I'm

02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:59.500
sure something will happen by December 2015 when the new Star Wars movie comes out guaranteed you

02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:04.380
know avalanche is the company behind just cause which may know very exciting and they also have

02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:10.380
them a new Mad Max game coming out so that oh you very awesome I liked the trailer for that they

02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:16.580
know how to make a good multiplayer game or new open-world game so it's it's December 2013 now so

02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:21.780
you got two years to make it happen it sounds like they already got started so we'll see what

02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:28.100
happens don't make me feel older just think about how old we're gonna be when the new Star Wars movie

02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:32.700
finally comes out the Warcraft movie you know what is next year huh my 20th high school reunion oh

02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:39.620
my gosh Wow so are you gonna go if someone gives me $400 for the plane ticket yeah I'm gonna try

02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:46.740
to my ten-year reunion was practically just downtown where I go all the time didn't go yeah

02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:51.740
well you're not from another state right I'm not but I'm just saying I just anybody my ten-year

02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:56.420
reunion was crap I don't think we had one for mine if we did I didn't care most people I want

02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:01.140
to keep in touch with I'm I still talk to on Facebook it was yeah I actually keep up with

02:20:01.140 --> 02:20:06.300
those people some of those people now on Facebook and I'm like you have kids I have a cat there

02:20:06.580 --> 02:20:11.460
would love my cat there is high school was such a bad time in some ways it was good in some ways

02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:15.780
it's bad I want to make it sound like poor me because we all had bad experiences I'm sure but

02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:20.940
there's just some people from high school I would really love to go my entire life and just never

02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:26.140
see again and that would be I would be very happy with that I can sympathize with that I just want

02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:33.940
to bring Dan and have Dan and then like leave early like I did for homecoming my senior year

02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:42.220
like bye this place sucks hey don't have a story do you yes you do well how about some wow news is

02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:50.060
you know we've got oh my god space goats coast to coast I know but I'm not playing it because I

02:20:50.060 --> 02:20:56.380
promised I wasn't gonna get it but their lead designer sorry the lead system designer Greg

02:20:56.380 --> 02:21:02.340
Street left Blizzard he said bye I'm gone actually what he said is that and this is a quote I've been

02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:06.980
at Blizzard Entertainment for almost six years it has been epic and I have made many friends

02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:11.100
around the world and I've learned so much but I have a great opportunity for something new and

02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:17.380
exciting sadly it is time to move on he's also going to oculus right now no we don't know there's

02:21:17.380 --> 02:21:22.500
a lot of now there's a lot of tinfoil I mean being on the Horde house I talked to a lot of

02:21:22.500 --> 02:21:27.380
Warcraft people there's some tinfoil hats in the community that he possibly went to riot games

02:21:27.380 --> 02:21:32.860
maker of League of Legends also in LA this is based on a total conspiracy theory about who he

02:21:32.860 --> 02:21:39.820
follows on Twitter which is interesting um but I but I mean if he quit Warcraft to go to League

02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:45.340
of Legends he'd just be like everybody else yeah but I'm pumped which is strange blizzards new one

02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:51.340
is coming now yeah but the funny part is that it's not funny I know all right I just like well you

02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:56.660
know what people go and you know people moving from company to company usually isn't news but

02:21:56.660 --> 02:22:02.240
the thing about World of Warcraft man quasi quasi related question to that comment did

02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:07.020
your conspiracy theories come from people in California or outside of California all over

02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:13.020
they come from the internet where well it's it's a meaningful question to me because my my

02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:18.460
co-workers those that have lived in the Bay Area you know the better part of their lives have a

02:22:18.460 --> 02:22:24.140
lot of friends at a lot of companies either personally or professionally including our

02:22:24.140 --> 02:22:30.620
competitors and everything else and you know yeah yeah have has competitors I didn't know

02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:37.580
it kind of thought they did their own thing very much no oh there are the detail is the the depth

02:22:37.580 --> 02:22:42.540
is infinite it's you know everybody everybody has the this is better this is worse has the

02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:49.220
confrontational aspect of it and sure that exists at a professional level as well but it's not maybe

02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:56.420
I shouldn't rip back the veil but it's not like death death threats and and at odds ends with

02:22:56.420 --> 02:23:03.380
each other I mean we just had a charity dodgeball game where our best friends at competing companies

02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:08.380
came out for a good cause as well we do whenever we throw drink ups people from all of these

02:23:08.380 --> 02:23:15.700
companies come out it's not yeah professionally the it's it's competition but that's healthy and

02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:21.620
the people that make it up are good people you know for the short time that I interned at a

02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:27.620
local TV news station as I was going to be just like Ron Burgundy one day and here here I am but

02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:31.580
I interned in a local TV station and they would about once every three months there would be a

02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:36.980
big get-together of all the local news people from all like NBC CBS all of them would just go

02:23:36.980 --> 02:23:42.740
have dinner like it's not they all hated each other because a lot of times and especially look

02:23:42.740 --> 02:23:47.340
at your own local TV news they trade people all the time and people go to jobs to the companies

02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:52.700
and it just you know something that happens yeah we that this this is industry this is why they're

02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:57.820
there's conventions professional conventions where all of these same people talk discuss and meet all

02:23:57.820 --> 02:24:02.900
the rest of these people and it's also why you don't truly have companies that just bicker back

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:07.140
and forth in the same industry and are just like at odds ends with people it's I don't know it's

02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:12.660
interesting it's interesting insight for me to have now as well let's move on with more stories

02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:19.620
Loki all right so you know one of the first things of course to come out of a tragedy like Sandy

02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:27.020
Hook was let's blame Pete you know video games because obviously this person had video games

02:24:27.020 --> 02:24:32.500
played video games clearly video games must have caused it you know because we could also draw that

02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:38.300
conclusion to food food must cause this because he eats food therefore you know food caused murder

02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:46.700
anyway so there was a report that was done you know showing all the different games you played

02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:55.620
and stuff and unfortunately even though you know with that profile everything it just it didn't tie

02:24:55.620 --> 02:25:02.300
with the games at all it said he played video games often both solo home and online they can

02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:08.180
be described as both violent and nonviolent one person described the shooter as spending the

02:25:08.620 --> 02:25:14.220
of his time playing non-violent video games all day with one of his favorites at one point being

02:25:14.220 --> 02:25:20.420
Super Mario but there you go Super Mario Bros. causes mass murder well there was a let's go I'll

02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:25.100
let you finish cuz I'm about to drag a bit it's the shadow people that live on top of the cliff

02:25:25.100 --> 02:25:31.380
and I'm about to drag a bit in conclusion you know what we do know is the shooter had significant

02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:35.580
mental health issues while now affecting the criminality of the shooters mental state for

02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:40.900
their crimes or his criminal responsibility for him did affect his ability to live a normal life

02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:47.780
interact with others whom he should have been close with and you know video games did not play

02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:57.620
a part in that so yeah and it's funny as even though after that came out of course the NRA

02:25:57.620 --> 02:26:04.980
issued a statement blaming still are actually no I'm sorry that this is referring back to the the

02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:11.060
original thing where the NRA blamed it of course no traction on that you know no retraction from

02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:18.140
the NRA about being wrong or anything as they usually are I was looking at Twitter this week

02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:22.940
as I usually do during the day and I saw a link and I made the mistake of clicking on it even

02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:27.980
though I saw the name Kotaku in the URL and my eyes rolled so far to the back of my head I could

02:26:27.980 --> 02:26:33.660
see my fucking brain because they ran a story about how the Sandy Hook shooter his favorite

02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:39.100
game was dance dance revolution and this guy played DDR all the time and dah dah dah dah and

02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:46.860
all I could really think of like I was just like Kotaku please shut the fuck up please please shut

02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:51.860
up I I saw these links I didn't read the article surely they were making it tongue-in-cheek and

02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:57.340
making the same point that we are which I'm just sitting here going why are you perpetuating this

02:26:57.340 --> 02:27:02.860
whole I mean it's it's kind of irresponsible it's clearly clickbait it's clearly this whole

02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:07.900
let's and I'm not even saying this because I played DDR for years and years because unlike

02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:15.420
what you do when you run a story like this I don't give this shit any credit at all clearly

02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:19.740
and even the professionals have now said the video games had nothing to do with it and you

02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:25.020
know what happened obviously was a huge tragedy let's not forget I mean had just how awful and

02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:31.500
fucked up what this guy did was people want to blame something for it the unfortunate reality

02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:40.700
is there may not be anything we can blame but evil mental health there's that too I mean that's I get

02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:45.500
that speculation you know I mean it's just so with the state of I hate to go into the politics

02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:51.860
of it you know but we don't give enough attention to mental health I there is no background checks

02:27:51.860 --> 02:27:56.740
there's definitely a lot of stigma with that and and we we have to break down those walls a lot and

02:27:56.740 --> 02:28:03.140
I would agree with you there that you know clearly he had issues that weren't being addressed I don't

02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:08.260
know trying to beat those nine footers might frustrate someone into no I'm serious but yeah

02:28:08.260 --> 02:28:17.500
so anyway I'm just saying the ban on that website continues and you know shame on me for being dumb

02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:23.180
enough to click a link like that but I was just like no no they could oh my god every so often

02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:27.420
you have to confirm that yes they're stupid yeah it's just kind of one of those like Lord get a

02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:35.420
look anyhow let's see going to our chat room at live dot vog network comm SSJ 100 Matt says

02:28:35.420 --> 02:28:45.860
basically this report answered no questions let's see a coup the peggle pervert says see how and

02:28:46.180 --> 02:28:53.980
oh Lord all right uh let's move on more stories and I will go next well you remember also to the

02:28:53.980 --> 02:29:00.540
people used to blame D&D on making people be devil worshippers yes and Mike when my mom found out I

02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:05.340
played D&D in high school she like threw a fit because she thought it was devil worship well my

02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:09.300
grandma did the same thing so when I'd go play D&D at my friend Derek's house I'd be by we're all

02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:14.740
for our weekly chicken sacrifice Rob right you are not we're seeing them worshipping the devil

02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:20.500
are you Rob that way you do that's what they said on Oprah Rob Rob do don't play Dungeons & Dragons

02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:30.300
Rob that's what it was like they said on the 700 Club that watch that shit so I don't even know

02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:34.620
how they got bored by the way you or when they started caring if I worship did you hear that

02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:39.780
the guy that started the Trinity Broadcasting Network died no I didn't yeah he died yesterday

02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:45.100
that Fast and Furious dude too but yeah I was gonna say all I all I heard about on Facebook

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:49.340
was the guy from Fast and the Furious yeah but that guy died too and no one cared well because

02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:54.740
I'm not gonna fit I'm not I'm not even gonna finish my thought or I'm gonna be a bad person

02:29:54.740 --> 02:30:02.340
so I'm just gonna bite my tongue and talk about the PlayStation 4 hey and well here's the thing

02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:07.780
about the PlayStation 4 it may not last long hold on hold on I'm not trolling here's the thing there

02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:14.740
was a comment from Sony UK pop UK boss Fergal Gara because of course the PlayStation just

02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:19.300
launched in the UK this week there's a lot of stuff in the media over there this week and

02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:23.900
Fergal Gara made a very interesting comment saying quote I think there's reasons to believe that the

02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:29.220
next cycle might be shorter in markets such as the UK it's probably a sign of the times and how much

02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:32.940
has changed in seven years but I think the willingness and the appetite to pick up new

02:30:32.940 --> 02:30:37.940
technology fast has probably changed quite a bit so all this coming down to will the ps4 be a

02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:45.100
10-year lifecycle maybe not horseshit please I and this is this is going back to the question

02:30:45.100 --> 02:30:50.860
of the week and this is a question I've had in my mind for a very long time as far as a new console

02:30:50.860 --> 02:30:56.820
a new technology a new technology and an overhaul what the hell else are they gonna do the video

02:30:56.820 --> 02:31:01.300
game the quality the visual aspect and quality of video games has improved dramatically and

02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:06.980
considering that every you know unless everybody box on 4k and rolls that into a new technology

02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:12.700
there's no that you know there's no visual dramatic changes that they can make you know in the next

02:31:12.700 --> 02:31:18.580
five Jason I want to say yes but I when I was 12 years old and saw Super Nintendo mode 7 for the

02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:25.140
first time I was like it's so fucking real it'll never get more real than that oh my god but so

02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:32.940
cool but that is a terrible comparison that is fuck you do because no well no the quality

02:31:32.940 --> 02:31:39.180
standard is cinema slash real life and one step closer to the holodeck Jason that's what we always

02:31:39.180 --> 02:31:43.860
say on the show every console is one step closer to the but but that would be a different technology

02:31:43.860 --> 02:31:47.660
that's not just a graphical improvement which is what I'm claiming right now but there's nothing

02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:53.660
that can take that mantle in the next generation to make the ps4 is timeline a lifecycle be less

02:31:53.660 --> 02:32:02.060
than for you like or soft lightroom Jason it's gonna holodeck you all listen it the difference

02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:09.220
would be moving from a you can't I don't really think you can use the holodeck as a graphical

02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:12.980
comparison because this is what I'm saying one step closer Jamie we're not gonna be at the

02:32:12.980 --> 02:32:19.780
holodeck the next generation there'll be awesome if we were more apt comparison would be shut up

02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:27.980
would be leaving your monitor for a holographic interface well that's what they have in the

02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:37.700
Hunger Games that was the correct reaction the endgame can only be one I didn't break the mic

02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:44.060
listen the endgame can only be one thing and that's where the boobies become real and you

02:32:44.060 --> 02:32:50.220
put your penis in it that is really the endgame that anyone can expect because where do you need

02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:56.580
to go beyond that not nowhere you know everybody is interested in that thank you I understand that

02:32:56.580 --> 02:33:02.860
but that's gonna be the endgame I want fluffy kitties I want to be able to pet the kitties in

02:33:02.860 --> 02:33:08.900
the game as do I but I'm just there will be a switch there will be pussy there will there will

02:33:08.900 --> 02:33:14.220
be a switch just like on the old Atari 2600 game select there will be booby and kitty and then of

02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:23.620
course you know and ferret mode moving on all right that's the show 100 Matt and chat says

02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:29.540
one step closer to the edge and it's about to break just like this show we've been one step to

02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:35.620
the edge since episode three okay and I wasn't even here dark soccer I was I was sleeping in a

02:33:35.620 --> 02:33:44.940
closet real story damn it you know what Rob pet the pussy she came out for a little bit I was

02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:52.860
surprised now this is one thing that is super cool if we can get away from the bullshittery

02:33:52.860 --> 02:34:02.940
of you know fake reporting and all the gun violence and and pussies everybody those two

02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:08.700
last statements do go well together you have whatever I was trying to tie it in but I'm so

02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:13.820
flustered right now because of the Cyber Monday event for Rosetta Stone ad that's on this page

02:34:13.820 --> 02:34:20.420
no seriously um there are a team of neuroscientists at the University of Pennsylvania and Friedberg

02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:28.180
University that are using video games where people go through virtual towns basically just

02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:33.100
delivering oh you know they're using fucking Animal Crossing but I mean they're going around

02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:37.820
and delivering stuff in these in these locations in the game but they're looking at how the brain

02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:48.500
encodes spatial information to form I guess location tags for memories and basically there's

02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:52.500
actually a mental technique I don't know if anyone's ever heard of something called the

02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:59.420
mind palace basically where for you to remember certain information you visualize rooms in a

02:34:59.420 --> 02:35:07.740
palace and it's mapping it's using spatial mapping to instead trigger a memory and it sounds like

02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:15.220
that this is sort of what they're doing but they're also using this more as a study for epilepsy which

02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:22.740
is very interesting they're basically trying to find direct neural evidence that memory that

02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:31.660
basically memory tags information based on where and when they were formed so that you're you

02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:38.020
access the memory by remembering that situation and I know for me in particular and I know I

02:35:38.020 --> 02:35:44.980
haven't been like overly verbal on this but at the end of January I was diagnosed with autism

02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:53.620
in like not I'm gonna go repeat myself a bajillion times and kill people no that doesn't happen the

02:35:53.620 --> 02:36:00.540
whole thing too is that it's actually been how I remember a lot of stuff is by remembering visually

02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:07.300
what where I was what I did I couldn't remember the name of this one shop for the record until I

02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:11.540
was standing at IKEA facing the direction that the shop was in and then I remembered the name of it

02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:20.180
for example you know so it's it's definitely got a bit of a definite interest I mean we're talking

02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:27.420
about that mind palace technique having been a mental memory building tool that's been in

02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:36.500
existence since before the the current era it's been in existence for centuries for thousands of

02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:42.980
years so the fact that they're putting using a video game to actually test how the brain maps

02:36:42.980 --> 02:36:48.500
this information and using this technique in a visual manner is I think it's a pretty neat

02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:56.260
thing honestly so nice yeah games doing good I appreciate a story like that after the fuckery

02:36:56.260 --> 02:37:01.220
we had a couple stories ago there's another thing too that they were I'm just gonna read this

02:37:01.220 --> 02:37:06.180
because it is kind of technical but I'm gonna quote it because it says during navigation neurons

02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:11.700
in the hippocampus and neighboring regions can often represent the patient's virtual location

02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:16.900
within the town kind of like a brain GPS device these so-called place cells are perhaps the most

02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:22.100
striking example of the neuron that encodes an abstract cognitive representation so basically

02:37:22.100 --> 02:37:26.980
where they're visualizing themselves in their game environment is where their mind is visualizing the

02:37:26.980 --> 02:37:34.580
data that they're researching too so again it's there's a tie between how we think what we remember

02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:38.740
and how we access our memories I think it's fantastic that they're doing this and hi scenario

02:37:39.860 --> 02:37:44.740
kitty no she's in the living room she's getting a little more friendly during the show it's good

02:37:44.740 --> 02:37:48.980
all right uh anyhow let's move on uh dark sakura is going to open up the mail bag

02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:54.900
mailbag at orange laundry.com is the place to send emails and I think it was a little bit lonely in

02:37:54.900 --> 02:37:59.460
there this week but at least there was one right yeah and I think though that some no there was

02:37:59.460 --> 02:38:06.740
only one uh so I'll read it um hello oh lorry ease um I have a fairly decent income and the

02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:12.340
purchase of both systems really hit my savings hard I can see why most everyone will only get

02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:17.780
one of either the ps4 or the xbox one I think they're both solid and with good games but I'd

02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:22.420
like the games on the xbox xbox went a little better I think I can sum up my comparison of

02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:26.980
the systems with an analogy the playstation is like someone handing out candy to everyone in

02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:31.300
the form of a roll of mentos the xbox is like someone grabbing handfuls of candy and throwing

02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:39.140
them into a crowd um enjoy and remember to brush your teeth robaba yes sir I'll brush my teeth I

02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:45.140
love robaba I I wish I could have been in the situation where I could buy both consoles this

02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:49.860
year if I wasn't in debt after my last Disneyland trip I would I'd like to be in the position where

02:38:49.860 --> 02:38:57.860
I can just go to Disneyland soon soon yeah all right uh mailbag at orange laundry.com if you

02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:02.740
want to make some crazy analogies on the show in the future it'd be awesome mailbag at orange

02:39:02.740 --> 02:39:09.860
laundry.com uh now is the part of the show where we get a little bit angry even though you know

02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:15.380
there's been a lot of happy stuff tonight uh we have to balance that with some anger and rar

02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:17.140
because FUs of the week

02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:39.780
I am actually not very angry today except for I mean the usual stuff

02:39:40.660 --> 02:39:44.340
so yeah I guess I'm pretty angry not really I'm angry on behalf of Becky

02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:49.700
I'm very glad that I did not get hired where she is employed at and I cannot go into

02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:56.180
more detail because I was advised of a lot in confidence but um fuck that place fuck it a lot

02:39:58.260 --> 02:40:06.580
um oh and also fuck bitch face Vicky who was my ex-boss who sold the company to the current place

02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:11.940
for um and I heard about this so I again not something I can prove and just nail her ass to

02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:16.660
the wall about but for apparently bad mouthing me to the current owner of the company because

02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:20.580
she couldn't handle she thinks I was trying to ruin her business you know what if I was trying

02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:24.580
to ruin your business it would have been gone before you sold it you didn't change your

02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:30.900
passwords duh all right lucky I figured you're out for not playing Grand Theft Auto 5 yet

02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:35.700
it's only $39.99 amazon really on ps3

02:40:38.980 --> 02:40:42.260
FU to Loki for trying to get me to spend more money when I already spent

02:40:42.260 --> 02:40:46.100
too much on goddamn steam sales but at least all the steam games are really good

02:40:46.100 --> 02:40:51.540
I can't be too upset uh Jason I was going to say that I'm happy little bunny this

02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:57.140
week and that's mostly true but uh amusingly and perhaps not at all surprisingly enough

02:40:57.140 --> 02:41:04.660
to last week's FU uh I'm having a weird snafu with the uh the parking garage that I'm in right

02:41:04.660 --> 02:41:13.460
now and people are being very silly and blaming me for something I'm sure they there's a dresser

02:41:13.460 --> 02:41:17.780
something at the end of my parking spot and people are telling me to move the extra three inches in

02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:25.300
that dresser is not ours it's not part of our unit so um I need to figure out whose it is so

02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:30.740
I can actually pull in the whole way to the parking lot all right which you know San Francisco

02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:35.140
type parking you can understand how being even that much further away from your normal spot

02:41:35.140 --> 02:41:42.900
would be detrimental admittedly parking in San Francisco oh my god terror terror yes all right

02:41:42.900 --> 02:41:50.340
FU to terror uh just a couple more stories for you guys Loki speaking of terror Lindsey Lohan

02:41:51.220 --> 02:42:02.020
what segue of the year goes to Lindsey Lohan is now allegedly uh suing Rockstar Games over GTA V

02:42:02.020 --> 02:42:08.740
because there is you know the whole game takes place in uh like a Hollywood environment there's

02:42:08.740 --> 02:42:15.460
you know different celebrities and stuff that you run into and you know they act very cliche

02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:20.820
like some of these celebrities might but she thinks that one of those characters is directly

02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:30.660
based off of her good luck with that because um no no don't we have like laws for parody and

02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:35.620
especially if you're a parody public figure not a character that's just exactly her it's it's all

02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:43.060
of the different you know female celebrities that are on the flip side how much do we actually

02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:46.660
believe that Lindsey Lohan would be suing a freaking video game I mean really

02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:53.780
and besides that parody is protected I just want to make sure this news is coming from Kotaku is it

02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:58.500
because it sounds like the type of story they'd write I don't know if it's better or worse

02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:09.220
never mind it's coming from TMZ oh god oh god well it's just probably why everyone doubted the

02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:15.060
it's about the same level death reporting yesterday too yeah yeah so all right well

02:43:15.060 --> 02:43:22.340
if TMZ reported it Loki it must be true so yes she's claiming that I love that I'm gonna direct

02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:27.700
quote this because of their wording uh claiming that video game honchos jacked her image without

02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:36.820
her permission who uses honcho anymore apparently uh somebody does some some TMZ staffer

02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:45.380
well whatever to that good luck Lindsey Lohan and yeah TMZ you're both gonna need it all right uh

02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:49.460
also good luck to all of you that were awaiting this new console this actually sounded really

02:43:49.460 --> 02:43:53.300
awesome and I was looking forward to this I was hoping to maybe pick one up at some point but

02:43:53.300 --> 02:43:59.300
it's gonna have to wait till next year because the retron 5 console or the retro N I think retron's

02:43:59.300 --> 02:44:03.940
better name but retro N or whatever the retro N5 console has been delayed to the first quarter of

02:44:03.940 --> 02:44:08.820
2014 if you did not know what this was this was the this was the system that would play

02:44:08.820 --> 02:44:15.620
Game Boy Advance games Super Nintendo games Genesis games NES games and Famicom games all

02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:20.740
in one hence the number five and it had like an HDMI out so it would make it work on newer TVs

02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:27.860
that's uh pretty awesome and uh it's been delayed because of faulty pins discovered in some packaged

02:44:27.860 --> 02:44:32.580
units at least they're doing the right thing and pulling it and fixing the problem as opposed to

02:44:32.580 --> 02:44:37.460
selling some crap units so unfortunately if you were hoping to get one on its release day December

02:44:37.460 --> 02:44:45.220
10th too bad you won't all right uh there it is that's it for the news we had uh in our show

02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:48.500
roll tonight but we are going to open up the Skyblind we're actually kind of on schedule too

02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:53.860
now yeah we made up the time there in part B good are you okay Alan oh I thought he fell I thought

02:44:53.860 --> 02:44:58.020
he tripped didn't sound like he tripped in there a little bit I was like oh my god I have to call

02:44:58.020 --> 02:45:04.820
911 mid show all right uh 1877 game OLR is the number or you can call us on skype orange lounge

02:45:04.820 --> 02:45:09.140
radio all one word is the place to give us a call if you want to be on the show to uh talk about

02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:13.380
whatever we talked about tonight or maybe something that we missed who knows but uh while we wait for

02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:17.620
the calls to come in uh Loki I'll quickly call on you for any last minute stories and I'll go to our

02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:23.540
twitter as well for any twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR I just want to mention again

02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:28.740
you know because I do like Just Cause and because the multiplayer seriously the videos in the

02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:35.540
multiplayer look fucking crazy so um if you're interested Just Cause 2 it's like $2.99 right

02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:41.540
now on steam totally worth it and then if you want to get into the Just Cause multiplayer beta

02:45:41.540 --> 02:45:50.580
um because it's launching final pretty soon uh it's uh www.jc-mp.com and I believe the it's uh

02:45:51.140 --> 02:45:57.060
yeah www.jc.mp.com slash keys will get you a steam key just have to log in with your steam

02:45:57.060 --> 02:46:00.980
id and register an account on that website all right enjoy enjoy uh taking that check to the

02:46:00.980 --> 02:46:06.740
bank a thousand play well it's free it's a thousand players they had tested at one time

02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:10.020
it's ridiculous all right I gotta go to the phones because it's lighting up so hi you're

02:46:10.020 --> 02:46:15.220
on orange launch radio who's this the one and only person in the chat room the fastest internet ever

02:46:15.220 --> 02:46:23.460
it's ron internet's how you doing rama I'm good how about you good sir I'm great and I'm realizing

02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:28.020
with all the conventions you go to I think I need to send you some of my balls exactly I

02:46:28.020 --> 02:46:33.860
would use some of your balls and spread the love around spread my balls all over that sounds like

02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:37.780
but just take rob's balls and throw them at everyone to be fair they're not actually my

02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:44.980
balls they're grandpa's balls yeah I just I just want you to know you should be thankful

02:46:44.980 --> 02:46:49.460
that mako isn't listening right now because she'll be squeeing over the fact that she gets to play

02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:55.540
with your balls hopefully she'll hear it on the podcast feed well it's a good thing they're not

02:46:55.540 --> 02:47:02.420
sweaty balls if you missed if you missed the first part of the show uh grandpa uh matt from

02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:08.500
horde house got a bunch of little hacky sacks with the vog logo and website url printed on them

02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:13.780
as giveaways for Blizzcon well he only gave about half of them away so now we're gonna pass them on

02:47:13.780 --> 02:47:19.060
to other vog hosts and so forth uh to hand them out at later conventions so when we talk about

02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:24.580
our balls they are balls and they're kind of squishy they're fun to play with and our balls

02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:29.620
yeah have balls anyhow I'm sure you didn't call in just to talk about balls what is on your mind

02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:37.860
that's what you sorry how do you know I didn't call well surprise me then let's let's let's talk

02:47:37.860 --> 02:47:45.460
balls no no no did not come to talk balls couple things I want to talk about from tonight's uh

02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:52.180
discussion sure now I understand that olr is the place where every person has their voice

02:47:52.180 --> 02:47:59.060
now in response to that one person who wrote in about how you guys are being biased towards one

02:47:59.060 --> 02:48:08.260
console yes shit happens these shit happens yeah I mean on our podcast we talk about different

02:48:08.260 --> 02:48:14.100
things but sometimes we get on one topic or one company for a while and it's like well that's what

02:48:14.100 --> 02:48:19.780
everybody is talking about just because we're talking about it as well that does not mean what

02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:25.700
we're saying is the same as everybody else right and I do want to I do want to remind you it wasn't

02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:33.300
just one person I only read one thing on the air yeah and one thing is that everyone gets to turn

02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:40.260
in the barrel so for that point for a while it was xbox one's turn to be in the barrel that's

02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:45.700
that's how that's how the news goes yeah I think I think that's very true um the same thing happens

02:48:45.700 --> 02:48:51.220
in politics right you know sometimes it's the the red team or sometimes it's the blue team or

02:48:51.220 --> 02:48:57.140
sometimes it's it's all of them honestly so um you know it just just kind of depends on on what

02:48:57.140 --> 02:49:03.300
the public eye is person is watching yes like for example when heroes of cosplay was on tv

02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:09.220
all the blogs all the podcasts that's what everybody was talking about was heroes of cosplay

02:49:09.220 --> 02:49:14.900
and then we're talking about it but we're like yeah we watch it only because I'm drinking when

02:49:14.900 --> 02:49:19.780
I'm watching it and I'm giving my personal spin on it so it's a lot more entertaining as comparing to

02:49:19.860 --> 02:49:24.100
what everybody else is saying about the show yeah I saw that there was some uh because you know

02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:27.700
everything's got to have an internet petition these days there's some internet petition going

02:49:27.700 --> 02:49:33.620
around to uh make it fairly represent cosplay and I was kind of like well then it wouldn't

02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:38.020
really be I mean it's tv right it's it's and it funny enough I don't know if you heard the

02:49:38.020 --> 02:49:41.380
interview with Matt but we were joking at the end there about his time on the uh America's

02:49:41.380 --> 02:49:46.740
worst driver and you know it was it was just tv it was tv show all right the fact that you brought

02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:51.380
up there as a petition I wanted to put my headset down and just start falling over laughter because

02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:58.580
how well you try to put a personal a positive spin on cosplay as soon as it hits tv it's nothing

02:49:58.580 --> 02:50:02.740
but drama drama drama drama drama and people are complaining about how it's gonna wreck the

02:50:02.740 --> 02:50:06.500
community no you just brought everybody together I'm sure you know what if somebody did a reality

02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:13.140
show about orange lounge radio there'd be oh my god the shit talking right like that because

02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:17.620
that's what tv does and that's that's what would happen even though you know what we all we all get

02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:22.260
along mostly when it when it comes to no for real we all get along great when it comes to you know

02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:26.740
time to do the show the run for president do we do we have our disagreements behind the scenes

02:50:26.740 --> 02:50:30.900
sure once in a while but they're disagreements among friends don't if you don't shut up what

02:50:30.900 --> 02:50:36.500
are you talking about you don't know shit I'm totally judging you it no in all seriousness like

02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:43.060
any argument we have behind the scenes is like like I think if any friendship goes forever with

02:50:43.060 --> 02:50:49.700
no disagreements it's like that's that's almost boring yeah that sounds right also on the same

02:50:49.700 --> 02:50:54.500
token when you're arguing it kind of brings the friendship stronger because you got from points

02:50:54.500 --> 02:50:59.380
of view that you bring it to the table yeah and then when you're tired of arguing you look at

02:50:59.380 --> 02:51:04.980
Jamie like you want a drink let's have a drink that's right that's right I had seven last night

02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:12.420
any problem can be solved with liberal amounts of booze uh so you know what I I like that as a um

02:51:12.420 --> 02:51:18.500
great response to you know just just the the people that felt a little bit like um uh that

02:51:18.500 --> 02:51:22.900
maybe maybe picked on in their fandom or whatever from last week's show is just like you know hey

02:51:22.900 --> 02:51:29.140

02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:25.620
and uh you know you always say this is the show where every gamer has a voice and um I just want

02:53:25.700 --> 02:53:32.340
to voice my opinion on this whole uh supposed console war do it um yeah me okay it can it can

02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:37.780
be said that I'm more on the side of playstation 4 like I'll admit that like right away but it's

02:53:37.780 --> 02:53:42.980
not so much where it's you know for me it's not really Sony versus Microsoft it's really their

02:53:42.980 --> 02:53:47.780
policies that really pissed me off I feel that um you know I've been gaming for a long time I mean

02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:53.700
since the early 80s I've been gaming and I just see a trend happening that I don't like in gaming

02:53:53.700 --> 02:53:58.180
which you know I'm actually prevents me from playing a lot of games these days just for the

02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:02.500
simple fact that a lot of stuff is becoming I call it pay as you play with all this micro

02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:08.260
transaction shit uh Microsoft is pushing that um all this crap about you know where uh you know

02:54:08.260 --> 02:54:13.620
where you can lend your games and who you can lend it to the crappy uh the the freaking codes

02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:18.260
that they give you so that uh you know you can't sell your game at a game stop not that I do that

02:54:18.260 --> 02:54:24.260
like usually I like to just buy games brand new anyway online pass but um yeah yeah I just hate

02:54:24.260 --> 02:54:30.420
the fact that like it seems like you know um you know if you're the type of person where you trade

02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:33.860
your games or you might not have internet access or whatever it just seems like they're like

02:54:33.860 --> 02:54:37.860
cutting those people out like I'm like there's still people out there that don't have all these

02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:42.180
luxuries you know and like for you you know for you to just cut those people out like it really

02:54:42.180 --> 02:54:46.500
just rubs me the wrong way so like I've been like anti-microsoft for the longest time now I mean

02:54:46.580 --> 02:54:50.500
having even checked into xbox live and I don't know how many days I think well since this past

02:54:50.500 --> 02:54:55.220
summer you know so like you know I'm doing like my own type of little uh boycott that you could

02:54:55.220 --> 02:55:00.260
call it again certain not you know not just Microsoft but I mean a lot of the different

02:55:00.260 --> 02:55:04.820
game developers and companies that they do things that I don't necessarily agree with like I mean

02:55:04.820 --> 02:55:08.660
the list is huge I mean there's so many things that's going on right now let me let me ask let

02:55:08.660 --> 02:55:12.980
me ask this question because you know because the the online pass thing thankfully we're seeing that

02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:18.260
go away in a major way most of the companies that enacted it which to be fair Sony was one of them

02:55:18.260 --> 02:55:23.620
with their first party games most of them that enacted the the online pass have since sunsetted

02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:28.180
it I think there's only a couple stragglers out there and to Microsoft's credit they they never

02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:33.860
enacted the online pass on their first party games now we would have all raked them over the coals

02:55:33.860 --> 02:55:38.180
if they had because they were already charging a fee for xbox live so that you know that's neither

02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:43.780
here nor there but I guess my point I'm trying to make with this is when a when a company comes

02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:48.500
out and says you know what we were wrong we made the wrong decision which I think Microsoft kind

02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:56.500
of did since e3 is that is that not is that not what you want or what what is it what can the

02:55:56.500 --> 02:56:04.500
gaming companies do to win your fandom back uh just I mean you know just pretty much I would say

02:56:05.380 --> 02:56:12.260
as far as as far as when it comes to lending your lending your games out trading your games

02:56:12.260 --> 02:56:16.740
you know like I said people like to go into game stop and sell them whatever as far as that type of

02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:22.100
stuff goes don't you know don't try to put all these policies to get extra money out of people

02:56:22.100 --> 02:56:27.140
that do that like let let people do do what they've been doing for years don't interfere

02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:32.900
with that sell your game for 59.99 as once the person buys it you know that that that should be

02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:38.900
your income right there you shouldn't charge people again to trade something in or whatever

02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:43.860
the other crap that you're doing out there let let me buy my shit and own my shit when I pay 60

02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:48.900
bucks for your game I own that game right and especially with um like I said with these micro

02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:54.420
transactions I mean everybody everybody everybody's pretty much getting their hands dirty into

02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:58.660
something like um even steam I would even go out to steam and say that a few things that they're

02:56:58.660 --> 02:57:02.900
doing I don't necessarily agree with this um I don't know if you guys are aware of this but

02:57:02.900 --> 02:57:07.860
they have this new thing now where it's um the early access have you guys seen this yes I have

02:57:07.860 --> 02:57:13.460
in fact I I actually have a game with early access yeah yeah I bought into that too I actually have

02:57:13.460 --> 02:57:16.980
two games that are early access that you know they pretty much I mean from what I can see they

02:57:16.980 --> 02:57:22.180
look like they're like completed games but when you look at it you're like what the hell is going

02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:27.940
on now like we're actually paying now for it incomplete games like like these are like alpha

02:57:27.940 --> 02:57:31.940
games these are not even they're not even in beta you know a little minecraft you know what's

02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:35.380
interesting though about that kaijuto is I think kickstarter showed that there was a market for

02:57:35.380 --> 02:57:42.260
that yeah true so it's it's it it is weird it's weird to think that we are in that place with

02:57:42.260 --> 02:57:47.380
gaming but I think a lot of it and I've expressed this before and I think it's important to note

02:57:47.380 --> 02:57:52.260
let's not forget Microsoft realized they made a mistake there and they're they're trying to

02:57:52.260 --> 02:57:56.340
correct it for better or for worse I think that's important to note but as far as like the steam

02:57:56.340 --> 02:58:00.660
stuff goes and I remember saying this back when we all thought that this was the way Microsoft

02:58:00.660 --> 02:58:05.460
was going to go before they reversed I sort of said you know what I think it really depends how

02:58:05.460 --> 02:58:09.860
much they're going to charge for a game and I still kind of stand by that because I would have

02:58:09.860 --> 02:58:14.660
been totally fine with Microsoft's new policies if they were only charging 20 30 bucks for the game

02:58:14.660 --> 02:58:19.060
was that what was going to bring the price down from the 60 limit which let's be real is still a

02:58:19.060 --> 02:58:26.260
little high one of the perks of steam and one of the reasons why people use steam steam sale and

02:58:26.260 --> 02:58:33.380
being able to buy games for literally a dollar I bought dlc quest for a dollar and so it's kind of

02:58:33.380 --> 02:58:38.020
one of those all right so it's a digital copy and I'll never be able to sell it back it cost me a

02:58:38.020 --> 02:58:45.300
dollar and I'm like totally okay with that yeah I just finished um getting all the dlc that I needed

02:58:45.380 --> 02:58:50.660
for Skyrim and also picking up Morrowind on steam so you know I like I like steam for that but I

02:58:50.660 --> 02:58:56.980
mean um like I said it just it just looks like it to me I just don't like the uh the direction

02:58:56.980 --> 02:59:02.500
that things seem to be going in the the reason why I'm so anti-microsoft is just for the simple fact

02:59:02.500 --> 02:59:08.740
that inside me even though I'm pretty sure that um you know I'm the little man here it may never

02:59:08.740 --> 02:59:13.940
be effective but for me it's like I feel okay Microsoft is kind of leading this charge if I

02:59:13.940 --> 02:59:22.580
could find some way to uh to you know not not really to uh not really to uh um not really to

02:59:22.580 --> 02:59:27.700
make uh to make people go my way or see things my way but if I could find some way to just uh

02:59:28.660 --> 02:59:33.060
pretty much let them know that you know we don't agree with this or whatever you know maybe they'll

02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:38.100
start to uh change the policies like they did with the uh you know with the uh xbox one how they

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:43.140
reverted everything back yeah I'm just hoping that and more people hop on that and more people get on

02:59:43.140 --> 02:59:47.380
Microsoft and all the other people that are doing this type of you know these types of things then

02:59:47.380 --> 02:59:52.180
maybe we'll be able to uh get some balance you know I just want some balance in the um in the

02:59:52.180 --> 02:59:56.820
gaming world doesn't seem like it's that it just seems like pretty soon they're just gonna you know

02:59:56.820 --> 03:00:01.700
they're just gonna walk all over the little man and there isn't much that can be done unless unless

03:00:01.700 --> 03:00:06.100
us as gamers you know we start with all this console war crap and we see things for what they

03:00:06.100 --> 03:00:10.100
are you know we tell them hey you know we don't like we don't like microtransactions or you know

03:00:10.100 --> 03:00:14.580
maybe you can fix it you know stuff like that let me let me get this out let me get this out

03:00:14.580 --> 03:00:17.620
before we let you go because I think this is important to say because you know there's going

03:00:17.620 --> 03:00:21.460
to be people sitting at home or in the office listening to this podcast right now that is

03:00:21.460 --> 03:00:27.380
thinking this guy is crazy this guy needs to let it go this guy has too much hatred for easily you

03:00:27.380 --> 03:00:31.300
know there's people sitting there thinking that right oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I come across

03:00:31.300 --> 03:00:35.380
it all the time sure yeah but I think there's a good comment in the chat room that kind of plays

03:00:35.380 --> 03:00:38.660
into both sides of this here and I think I think this is important this is from Chris109 in the

03:00:38.660 --> 03:00:43.620
chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying yeah but the damage has been done and it takes time for

03:00:43.620 --> 03:00:48.900
the wound to heal and I think in a way whether you personally listening to the show think

03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:53.380
Kaijuto is overreacting or not I can certainly think you know I've gone to a place and I've

03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:58.020
got bad service or a company did something to really irritate me and it was a while before I

03:00:58.020 --> 03:01:05.060
tried that company again you know what I mean but I did go back at some point and either I learned

03:01:05.060 --> 03:01:09.060
why I stopped doing it in the first place or I was like all right things are better things have

03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:13.700
changed you know I'm happier now do you think Kaijuto that maybe that's what's going to happen

03:01:13.700 --> 03:01:19.060
is that if Microsoft is a little more transparent in some of these policies and kind of gets that

03:01:19.060 --> 03:01:23.940
community that they've lost that that tapped into the community if they can get some of that back

03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:31.460
that maybe we can heal these wounds well you know me me personally I'm not you know don't don't get

03:01:31.460 --> 03:01:36.900
me wrong like me I've already made my decision I mean my my boycott is gonna stick I mean that

03:01:36.900 --> 03:01:42.260
you know I have to do what I have to do for myself basically like for me you know I don't want to

03:01:42.260 --> 03:01:46.180
live in that type of gaming world so the games that I choose to purchase the companies that

03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:51.060
choose to invest in they don't do any of that right now you know so that's what I'm doing

03:01:51.060 --> 03:01:56.980
for myself you know like like I said I'm not out here to try and make people see things my way but

03:01:56.980 --> 03:02:02.660
I just want people to be aware that you know the gaming world as it is now is uh it's pretty

03:02:02.660 --> 03:02:07.300
screwed up and uh I'm just saying that people need to be aware of that stop with the console

03:02:07.300 --> 03:02:12.500
world stuff it's not about xbox versus uh playstation 3 for some of us out there for

03:02:12.500 --> 03:02:17.540
some of us it's more about hey you know don't you know don't cut the little man out you know

03:02:17.540 --> 03:02:21.780
you know you know remember where gaming or you know remember what gaming was about originally

03:02:21.780 --> 03:02:25.300
you know it was originally about fun I mean of course you have companies who you know they got

03:02:25.300 --> 03:02:29.620
to make money you know everybody says it all the time but I mean it was always fun you know

03:02:29.620 --> 03:02:32.500
trading with your you know trading with your friends and all this stuff and now it's just

03:02:32.500 --> 03:02:38.340
becoming way way too political and way too like out of hand all this crap so that's what I'm

03:02:38.340 --> 03:02:41.540
saying all right well I think you make a good point at the end of the day is it's just you

03:02:41.540 --> 03:02:45.700
know what play play play the games because there's a lot of good stuff out there right now so right

03:02:45.700 --> 03:02:49.300

call uh you know this week you know don't make serious calls all right well um now all you have

03:08:19.220 --> 03:08:25.780
you know I always have heard uh the topic is I was dealing with my cat at the time but uh

03:08:26.740 --> 03:08:32.420
I believe you know but you I believe like the three of you or well whoever you were talking

03:08:32.420 --> 03:08:40.980
about uh no someone linking again linking mental illness in video games to violence and uh

03:08:42.660 --> 03:08:50.420
yes you know you know and now I'm gonna open up here a little bit and talk about something

03:08:50.420 --> 03:08:59.460
that I generally don't talk about okay I'm mentally ill myself uh and you know I was

03:08:59.460 --> 03:09:08.580
back in 1998 I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder

03:09:09.940 --> 03:09:20.180
which is also known as PTSD also known as shell shock okay uh and as a result of between those

03:09:20.180 --> 03:09:31.620
two diagnoses I generally have a hard time regulating emotions and sometimes my behavior

03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:39.540
as a result can be a little bit off you know it can be construed as odd or unusual uh

03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:48.660
to someone they may not have to deal with mental illness now that being said just because someone's

03:09:48.660 --> 03:09:55.700
mentally ill you know regardless of whether they play video games or not that does not mean

03:09:55.700 --> 03:10:04.420
they're gonna go Norman Bates on someone's ass no nor go Texas Chainsaw Massacre on someone

03:10:04.420 --> 03:10:10.340
no one said they did well I think I don't think we did but I think the media sometimes gives that

03:10:10.740 --> 03:10:19.300
well you know I'm just saying that's what the general you know that's what the general uh

03:10:20.020 --> 03:10:25.700
perception is in society is that if someone someone has mental illness that's that's what

03:10:25.700 --> 03:10:29.460
we talk about when we talk about the stigma of mental health that's that's what's out there and

03:10:29.460 --> 03:10:33.380
thank you for opening up about that Raginator that's that's brave of you to say on the show

03:10:33.380 --> 03:10:39.060
and I'm going to say this the reality is there's there's a lot of people like you out there and

03:10:39.060 --> 03:10:45.060
it's funny even though I'm talking about earlier in the show I feel like the only gay nerd I bet

03:10:45.060 --> 03:10:49.860
you're not the only nerd pardon pardon me but you you must be a bit of a nerd if you listen to the

03:10:49.860 --> 03:10:53.380
show you're probably you're probably by far not the only nerd that suffers from the types of

03:10:53.380 --> 03:10:58.420
conditions that you're that you're talking about that you that you just brought up and um you know

03:10:58.420 --> 03:11:03.140
I think I think mental illness is much more common than sometimes the media and the mass perception

03:11:03.780 --> 03:11:11.060
often gives it credit for but there's also so many variant uh varieties and for example some people

03:11:11.060 --> 03:11:17.300
who have certain disorders don't consider it to be a mental illness for example yeah I may be

03:11:17.300 --> 03:11:24.020
autistic I don't consider myself mentally ill you know yeah if I had well and it in a way and just

03:11:24.020 --> 03:11:28.180
just to kind of you know because because like people get sick not mental illness but physical

03:11:28.180 --> 03:11:35.380
illness is a person with diabetes necessarily considered themselves sick not I mean they're

03:11:35.380 --> 03:11:40.660
managing you know I mean that's kind of what what happened right am I there's a difference because

03:11:40.660 --> 03:11:46.580
well I mean that the better comparison and I'm not and just I am not belittling diabetes by any

03:11:46.580 --> 03:11:51.300
mean my grandma had it and suffered from it and so forth but I'm just saying you start to kind of

03:11:51.300 --> 03:11:57.540
you know treat it and it doesn't like it doesn't you you conduct your day-to-day life managing it

03:11:57.540 --> 03:12:03.860
the difference would be in autism and type 1 diabetes would be closer to each other

03:12:03.860 --> 03:12:09.940
PTSD and type 2 diabetes would be closer to each other as a comparison because something happened

03:12:09.940 --> 03:12:17.700
that caused this it's an onset right whereas me I was born this way right so um that being said

03:12:17.700 --> 03:12:21.780
I think what they're not also considering is that some of these people who have gone back

03:12:22.420 --> 03:12:32.980
um were had much more severe forms of socio uh disorders had there wasn't one of them

03:12:32.980 --> 03:12:38.260
actually diagnosed schizophrenic which means they hallucinate schizophrenic is not multiple

03:12:38.260 --> 03:12:44.020
personality disorder there are two different things some people have complete reactions

03:12:44.020 --> 03:12:52.260
based on trauma I know people with PTSD and I'm talking about like the uh the post-war variety

03:12:52.260 --> 03:13:00.580
you know who you a car backfires and they're running for cover right you know that's the

03:13:00.580 --> 03:13:05.620
type of person I would not want with a gun for example that's somebody who I wouldn't want to

03:13:05.620 --> 03:13:11.780
have access to weapons because I've seen that instant look for panic look for defense you know

03:13:11.780 --> 03:13:17.700
sometimes there is that but when you're you know but the average person dealing with depression or

03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:22.340
dealing with just that you also I just want to be careful with the broad generalizations because

03:13:22.340 --> 03:13:28.420
you also would not be the one to say who and who shouldn't exactly a professional does this not you

03:13:28.420 --> 03:13:32.020
exactly but but my point what real quick raising you're sorry I'll let her finish the region here

03:13:32.020 --> 03:13:36.900
we'll get back to you my point on that was saying that is that if a person is going to have a

03:13:36.900 --> 03:13:45.060
tendency to go into a defensive mode or to go into some sort of a memory regression

03:13:46.020 --> 03:13:51.380
you want to watch you know but you don't know who everybody is that's why there has to be better

03:13:51.380 --> 03:13:56.100
screening that was my point sorry no no worries rage nator go ahead and get your thought out and

03:13:56.100 --> 03:14:02.580
then I have a question for you now also one thing to consider is you know you know regardless of

03:14:03.380 --> 03:14:12.020
what you know diagnosis that someone has be a ptsd or schizophrenia or this or other you know

03:14:12.020 --> 03:14:19.380
some questions that should be asked is are they in some form of treatment are they seeking one-on-one

03:14:19.380 --> 03:14:23.940
counseling are they seeing psychiatrists getting medications are they taking their

03:14:24.580 --> 03:14:31.220
medications as prescribed you know and it's usually taking up this pill or this pill

03:14:31.860 --> 03:14:37.940
at the right you know levels you know dosages every day consistently at the right time

03:14:38.820 --> 03:14:47.380
so and so forth and I mean you know if they're not you know they're not seeking you know treatments

03:14:47.380 --> 03:14:54.420
uh not taking their medications as prescribed if they're abusing street drugs or alcohol

03:14:55.300 --> 03:15:01.540
then yeah their their behavior is going to get far far worse and plus if

03:15:02.500 --> 03:15:08.980
they and if you also you know one thing to consider is on top of that

03:15:09.780 --> 03:15:17.060
ninth or more often than not the mentally ill is the the victim of crimes you know

03:15:17.060 --> 03:15:26.020
relative to perpetrator if you know you know if let's say uh hydrasically speaking I don't know

03:15:27.300 --> 03:15:33.140
you know you're Sacramento at all so I don't know what areas of town are the good

03:15:33.140 --> 03:15:38.180
side sites of town where aren't where the homeless tend to be so and so forth but

03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:46.580
if you can think of what area area that the homeless and the mentally ill tend to congregate

03:15:46.660 --> 03:15:52.100
and you happen to be on the street up to no good chances are you're gonna probably

03:15:53.780 --> 03:15:57.940
if you want an easy mark you're gonna probably go after the people that

03:15:58.580 --> 03:16:05.620
won't put out much of a fight which probably will be the mentally ill you know so you know

03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:12.340
what's new great well yeah you'll hear about the guy with schizophrenia that first some woman off

03:16:12.340 --> 03:16:18.420
of a training platform that woman gets killed but there are the exceptions to the rule not

03:16:18.420 --> 03:16:26.420
the world itself you know right and chances are there that person that can't take their medication

03:16:26.420 --> 03:16:35.700
or you know was doing wasn't alcohol alcohol drugs a few hours earlier or multiple whatever so

03:16:35.700 --> 03:16:40.020
rage nator let me let me ask you this and and and then we we will unfortunately I mean we can

03:16:40.020 --> 03:16:42.740
make a whole show out of this topic but we do have to wrap up for the night but rage nator let

03:16:42.740 --> 03:16:46.900
me ask you this because because you did share with us some pretty private information about

03:16:46.900 --> 03:16:51.940
your life and so forth and there is that stigma out there that you know video games are bad and

03:16:51.940 --> 03:16:57.860
video games make you uh want to do bad things how do you think rage nator maybe you don't have an

03:16:57.860 --> 03:17:02.820
answer for this but I want to try and ask it anyway uh rage nator how do you think video games

03:17:02.820 --> 03:17:13.220
help you uh well in the times that I stressed out you know or depressed you know let's say I'm

03:17:13.220 --> 03:17:22.180
feeling uh severe depression you know depression symptoms or there's some kind of stimulus outside

03:17:22.180 --> 03:17:32.020
that's really educating me one way or another uh and I use my video games as my primary

03:17:33.380 --> 03:17:44.020
coping uh coping mechanism to deal with uh the symptoms uh like uh at least prior to my ps3

03:17:44.020 --> 03:17:53.060
being uh stolen I would either play flower or super stardust hd and now obviously flower is

03:17:53.060 --> 03:18:03.460
a very relaxing game yeah very much or but regardless of the game now I'll focus in on that

03:18:03.460 --> 03:18:10.500
game for a while and for all intents and purposes while playing the game the rest of the world

03:18:10.500 --> 03:18:18.500
and my own thoughts no don't exist I just focusing on completing the level with being the level being

03:18:18.500 --> 03:18:29.780
the ai doing whatever and after a while uh things go back to normal and I use air quotes uh well

03:18:29.780 --> 03:18:39.860
normal for me right now sure sure and you know what's a great well that doesn't work 100 percent

03:18:39.860 --> 03:18:46.340
of time once a great well is so bad that I do need to be hospitalized case in point uh

03:18:47.300 --> 03:18:54.740
February 12th uh second of last year I did have to go to hospital for the suicide attempt but

03:18:54.740 --> 03:19:04.580
sorry to hear that but generally speaking the video games do work no no they help me focus in

03:19:04.580 --> 03:19:14.820
something else besides the the symptoms so well thank you for um sharing some very deeply personal

03:19:14.900 --> 03:19:19.140
stuff with us um but you know again to tie it back to something I was talking about at the

03:19:19.140 --> 03:19:23.540
beginning of the show sometimes it's about getting outside that bubble and there might be people out

03:19:23.540 --> 03:19:28.420
there that like don't kind of realize it and so maybe now they're thinking about it because you

03:19:28.420 --> 03:19:33.140
you said something about it here on the show so I really appreciate you opening up and uh how dare

03:19:33.140 --> 03:19:36.740
I suggest that you aren't capable of making a serious call because it was a very serious call

03:19:36.740 --> 03:19:41.460
thank you for that perspective don't I feel like a jackass definitely thank you though but I mean

03:19:41.460 --> 03:19:46.580
and this is one thing that I think everybody has a responsibility to do and that's educate yourself

03:19:47.460 --> 03:19:51.300
and people don't often think about educating themselves on something that's outside their

03:19:51.300 --> 03:19:56.580
comfort level their comfort zone walk walk a mile in somebody else's shoes because at least at the

03:19:56.580 --> 03:20:01.620
end of the day if nothing else you you have their shoes you have their shoes and you're a mile away

03:20:01.620 --> 03:20:06.980
all right yeah but but that was you know thank thank you for giving some incentive for education

03:20:06.980 --> 03:20:12.500
as well appreciate it sure all right rage nader I gotta I gotta end it up and end up the show

03:20:12.500 --> 03:20:16.180
thank you but thank you buddy have a good one sure no problem have a nice night all right you

03:20:16.180 --> 03:20:22.660
too uh props to rage nader says act deaf in our chat room there we go all right uh whoo

03:20:23.860 --> 03:20:28.660
and to think I almost didn't take that call because we were on our way out of here but now

03:20:28.660 --> 03:20:32.820
we are definitely on our fingers we're hovering over the altar just by time I know I was like

03:20:32.820 --> 03:20:36.340
am I gonna take it am I gonna take all right we're gonna take it so and it was a really really um

03:20:36.340 --> 03:20:40.980
insightful call heavy stuff on tonight's show my god we covered a lot of good stuff tonight

03:20:40.980 --> 03:20:45.140
it was a this is a damn good show this was what this was one for the emmys I have I don't know

03:20:45.140 --> 03:20:50.500
if they give emmys to podcast but if they did I'd be submitting this one I have one last fun silly

03:20:50.500 --> 03:20:54.340
thing okay good good please has anybody ever actually made it to the bottom of the steam

03:20:54.340 --> 03:20:58.500
cell page yeah and you've seen the fact that it's upside down yeah you notice the fact that it says

03:20:58.500 --> 03:21:03.620
spring yeah yeah no instead of autumn and if you actually use that navigation your experience will

03:21:03.620 --> 03:21:08.100
be temporarily upside down as well on on some pages not all you go all the way to the bottom

03:21:08.100 --> 03:21:13.460
you hit featured items you get the featured item pages where autumn is on bottom and everything is

03:21:13.460 --> 03:21:17.860
upside down you scroll to the top spring sale is oriented right side up incredibly silly but

03:21:17.860 --> 03:21:22.980
hilarious and I figure most people just scroll down until they see a game as soon as the game

03:21:22.980 --> 03:21:27.300
stopped being listed by yeah I'll have multi-button didn't get steam card didn't care

03:21:28.260 --> 03:21:33.620
exactly all right uh well and then for Australia since they're all upside down and it's spring

03:21:33.620 --> 03:21:40.340
there that's that's a joke it's a joke our our chat system at work we have a plug-in for it so

03:21:40.340 --> 03:21:47.460
anybody that's low even visiting anybody that's uh located as in the southern hemisphere that we

03:21:47.460 --> 03:21:52.500
rotate their avatars upside down that's amazing I love it it's called the Aussies plug-in all right

03:21:52.580 --> 03:21:56.260
uh Jason since you do have the mic I want to thank you for being here on the show yet again

03:21:56.260 --> 03:21:59.860
always I know you're going to be a familiar face while you're in town over the next month but it's

03:21:59.860 --> 03:22:05.860
uh it's great to have you here and um I I guess I'll ask you if you have any final thoughts

03:22:05.860 --> 03:22:11.940
before we see you next week I'll be continuing to say this because we're not even here yet but

03:22:11.940 --> 03:22:16.180
have a mighty fine holiday season well it already started if you think about it with the uh

03:22:16.180 --> 03:22:21.380
thanksgiving cup already so there you go and schools are going to start letting out real fast

03:22:21.380 --> 03:22:26.820
here and new systems and all the uh fancy exciting hellabaloo all right uh lowkey your

03:22:26.820 --> 03:22:35.140
final thought tonight so they're giving away uh some uh codes for mrs explosion man in the maw

03:22:35.140 --> 03:22:41.780
and aqua and stuff at mcdonald's really it's part of a promotion you know with xbox one stuff

03:22:41.780 --> 03:22:47.140
chicken mcnuggets all week long this is why you're back it's like when taco bell was giving away the

03:22:47.140 --> 03:22:54.020
ps4 uh I did like and oh and never mind uh I have a couple final thoughts here real quick and uh

03:22:54.020 --> 03:22:58.180
one uh it looks like it looks like some of you chatters are having a spirited debate right now

03:22:58.180 --> 03:23:01.460
so don't don't forget like rama and I were talking about earlier go have a drink at the end of the

03:23:01.460 --> 03:23:09.380
day I know you will uh and then my other final thought is um I neglected to plug this earlier

03:23:09.380 --> 03:23:13.860
in the show uh during because I was I was trying to speed along with everything else uh but I do

03:23:13.860 --> 03:23:16.740
want to mention it's kind of an additional housekeeping thing and I'll remind you guys at

03:23:49.060 --> 03:23:54.260
just the single game like the starter that's not the big but the starter set thing that's kind of

03:23:54.260 --> 03:24:00.180
hard to find notice but um I read or I saw on reddit apparently uh if you cut the top of the box

03:24:00.180 --> 03:24:03.860
yes but that's that's the uh that's the whole shebang that's that's not what we gave away we

you you you look like you're about ready to smoke a cigarette like that was a good debate

03:25:23.300 --> 03:25:29.380

a lot more of a turn on than well all righty then you know what I mean it's it's I find it
