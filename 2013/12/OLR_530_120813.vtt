00:00.000 --> 00:17.160
The Video Game Awards have come and gone and some exciting news has come out of it.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.640
Telltale picks up not one but two huge franchises slated for 2014.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.040
While one may be the worst kept secret, the other may surprise you.

00:23.040 --> 00:29.760
Your reactions, phone calls, and more on the show where every video gamer has a voice.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.360
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.360 --> 00:37.120
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.120 --> 00:45.700
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode 530 for this December the 8th of 2013.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.520
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me over the next few hours to talk video games and

00:49.520 --> 00:54.400
gaming culture and gamer lulls and probably a lot of other miscellaneous talk too.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.120
We have to fill three hours somehow.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.640
She's joining me as she does every week.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.840
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:00.840 --> 01:01.840
Hi.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.840
How are you?

01:02.840 --> 01:03.840
Educated.

01:03.840 --> 01:04.840
Educated.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.840
The more you know.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.800
Did you read a book today?

01:07.800 --> 01:10.120
No, I've been watching documentaries all week.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.640
Because that's what LeVar Burton taught me growing up.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.640
Take a look, it's in a book.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.640
Reading Rainbow.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.640
Exactly.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.200
I've been watching documentaries all week.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
Oh, there you go.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.960
They've been very interesting.

01:19.960 --> 01:24.800
When I first got Netflix, or I should say, well when Netflix was first first out it was

01:24.800 --> 01:26.120
only the DVDs, right?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.960
So when I first got the Netflix streaming, whenever that was, it was a couple of years

01:28.960 --> 01:29.960
ago, right?

01:29.960 --> 01:30.960
Well, you know, ish.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.840
One of the first things I did is I binged watched documentaries.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.500
Like I went through that phase too because, you know, Netflix streaming doesn't always

01:37.500 --> 01:41.240
have a lot of the current stuff, but they have a lot of the really like low budget,

01:41.240 --> 01:43.820
I'm using my pointy fingers, like documentaries and stuff.

01:43.820 --> 01:45.080
So it's a great thing to binge on.

01:45.080 --> 01:48.700
There's actually YouTube channels now that are all documentaries.

01:48.700 --> 01:54.840
And I've been watching a series called Extraordinary People on I think a few years ago in the UK.

01:54.840 --> 02:00.200
And they really, really, really like autistic savants, but they meet people all over the

02:00.200 --> 02:01.200
world.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
It's actually really cool.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.180
And a lot of surgery ones too, like people with odd growths on their face.

02:06.180 --> 02:10.520
Speaking of British, I noticed that Netflix is, and this is like a paid advertisement

02:10.520 --> 02:11.520
for them.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.520
We don't get paid.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.520
Pay us Netflix.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.840
There's no little code we have or anything, but they do, they have a lot of BBC and British

02:17.840 --> 02:18.840
programming on there.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.940
I noticed that too, which is pretty awesome.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.480
So do not insult Reading Rainbow by applying My Little Pony to it.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.120
What are you looking at?

02:26.120 --> 02:29.280
Our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.880
Of course you can join us in our chat.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.080
What did Act Def say there?

02:32.080 --> 02:35.240
Oh, Reading Rainbow dash.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.580
Live.vognetwork.com.

02:36.580 --> 02:40.120
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

02:40.120 --> 02:42.800
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.140
Also joining us here in studio tonight.

02:44.140 --> 02:45.140
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.140
Hello.

02:46.140 --> 02:47.140
How you doing, Loki?

02:47.140 --> 02:48.140
I'm fine.

02:48.140 --> 02:49.140
Awesome.

02:49.140 --> 02:50.140
Awesome.

02:50.140 --> 02:53.040
So, you know, there's a little, little parlor game that some of our chatters like to play,

02:53.100 --> 02:55.840
which is what food did Loki bring to the show tonight?

02:55.840 --> 02:57.880
And an old favorite returns tonight.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.080
I haven't seen you bring this in like six months, but what did you bring to the show

03:00.080 --> 03:01.080
tonight?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.080
Triple bacon pizza.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.640
Triple bacon pizza.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.820
Good for the heart.

03:06.820 --> 03:07.820
Low in sodium.

03:07.820 --> 03:08.820
Yep.

03:08.820 --> 03:09.820
All right.

03:09.820 --> 03:10.820
Amazing.

03:10.820 --> 03:11.820
I'll enjoy it.

03:11.820 --> 03:14.300
Also joining us in the studio tonight as he has been on and off since Thanksgiving because

03:14.300 --> 03:16.300
he's spending the holidays in the area.

03:16.300 --> 03:21.040
So why not give it up for VX Jason XV, X, Y, Z, L, N, O, P.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.040
DBQ LOL.

03:22.040 --> 03:25.940
I'm sure everybody's very surprised to hear my voice again, but always great to be here

03:25.940 --> 03:26.940
as usual.

03:26.940 --> 03:27.940
And always nice to have you.

03:27.940 --> 03:30.400
I'm it's we get adjacent for the holidays.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.440
It's my Christmas present to everybody.

03:32.440 --> 03:36.360
No, it's, it's, it's always great to have you are we, the more people in the studio,

03:36.360 --> 03:39.720
the merrier, you know, unfortunately you don't get a lot of, it would be great if we were

03:39.720 --> 03:42.900
all in San Francisco or something where a lot of people kind of come through and make

03:42.900 --> 03:45.440
you losers drive an hour and a half to get down there to me.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.440
Yeah.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.800
In Sacramento, it's a little harder to get the people up here to actually sit in studio

03:49.800 --> 03:50.800
with us.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.360
But, uh, you know, if you're ever in the area, let me know, always open a guest.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.180
It's it's, it's, it's conveniently located.

03:57.180 --> 04:02.040
You guys have an airport, you guys have a train station, you don't have an airport and

04:02.040 --> 04:07.240
running water, the whole government in California, 40 degree temperature week.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.080
And yeah, isn't that hilarious?

04:09.080 --> 04:12.720
How cold I'm using my 20 fingers, how cold it is right now.

04:12.720 --> 04:16.640
But it's like I tell people, um, you know, or like when it rains, you know, dark soccer

04:16.640 --> 04:19.800
loves to say, California, you guys don't know the rain.

04:19.800 --> 04:23.200
You got to spend some time in the south where it really rains or you know, what have you.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.240
But what about the rains in South Africa?

04:25.240 --> 04:26.880
What about the rains in Spain?

04:26.880 --> 04:27.880
Falls mainly on the plane.

04:27.880 --> 04:28.880
Okay.

04:28.880 --> 04:29.880
Toto.

04:29.880 --> 04:35.840
Um, uh, uh, the record, the weather right now is like February in Alabama.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.760
Well, I was gonna say though, one thing to keep in mind, we're not built for certain

04:39.760 --> 04:40.760
things.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.800
Like if it were to rain here, like it is in the south, we'd all be under water.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.640
We'd be part of the ocean, right?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.600
And now all of your houses would fall over.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.480
And with the cold, you know, we have, we have like outdoor pipes and stuff here is

04:50.480 --> 04:51.480
very common.

04:51.480 --> 04:52.480
And when it gets really cold.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.480
And houses made out of plywood.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.480
Yeah.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.840
Wrap your pipes, bring your pets in cause it's just not normal here.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.480
So you've never had to know the pleasure of filling your bathtub full of water and putting

05:02.480 --> 05:06.880
a teaspoon of bleach in it so that you have clean water when your water stops working

05:06.880 --> 05:08.280
after a hurricane.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.280
No thank you.

05:09.280 --> 05:15.440
You've never seen a tree the width of this table be uprooted right in front of your eyes.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.280
I will take the earth shaking randomly under my feet any day.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.520
I will take a hurricane any day.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.600
So it's 36 degrees here right now.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.560
Is this when I, is this when we play guess what it is in Colorado right now?

05:26.560 --> 05:27.920
Negative 20 I'm sure.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.920
Close.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.920
That's the feels like.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
No.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.480
It is currently nine degrees and will be one degree before the show is over.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.480
Wow.

05:34.480 --> 05:38.420
What up G in chat at live.voggenetwork.com says, I love the snowball games today.

05:38.420 --> 05:41.960
You know, not, not that we talk a lot about sports ball here on, here on OLR, but I got

05:41.960 --> 05:43.880
to say, I actually saw some of that game today.

05:43.880 --> 05:44.880
Yes I did.

05:44.880 --> 05:48.720
I saw some footballs today and uh, that was hardcore that they were out there playing

05:48.720 --> 05:52.320
in the snow and like it's the type of thing where like that you can't even see the damn

05:52.320 --> 05:55.720
lines that like they have to project the lines out there cause you can't even see them cause

05:55.720 --> 05:56.720
the damn snow.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.720
They're paid employees.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.640
They better play in any kind of conditions.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.980
Oh no Rob, you were, you were a band geek.

06:01.980 --> 06:05.960
So how about this marching competition in the snow?

06:05.960 --> 06:11.320
We never had the snow, but we had to do field show once in the pouring rain and so many

06:11.320 --> 06:12.320
of us slipped and fell.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.740
Like I slipped and fell in a mud thing, but you just get right back up and keep going.

06:15.740 --> 06:20.760
The last marching band competition I did was in Prattville, Alabama, which Prattville,

06:20.760 --> 06:26.520
um, and it was in the snow and we were all fucking cold and you had all the clarinet

06:26.520 --> 06:28.800
players that had the fingers cut out of their gloves.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.240
Did you play clarinet?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.320
No, Jamie played saxophone.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.160
All right.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.640
Anyhow we could talk band geek stories all night, but it is a video gaming show.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.120
So let's get back to the topic of video games at hand.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.740
Uh, tonight's kickoff topic.

06:41.740 --> 06:43.860
Ricky is actually going to start us off with our kickoff topic tonight.

06:43.860 --> 06:46.980
It's something a lot of people on Twitter and everything's been talking about.

06:46.980 --> 06:49.220
So I'm sure some of you are wondering when we were going to bring it up.

06:49.220 --> 06:50.220
So here you go.

06:50.220 --> 06:51.220
Yeah.

06:51.220 --> 06:55.460
It's just, we're going to talk a little bit about the VGX award show thing that they had

06:55.460 --> 07:01.620
yesterday on spike and it was also streamed on Twitch and all that fun stuff.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.300
Lots of interesting things coming out of that.

07:04.300 --> 07:11.060
Um, mostly just some new trailers for things, um, announcements of some things we'll get

07:11.060 --> 07:12.060
into later in the show.

07:12.060 --> 07:17.540
Some other stuff we'll get into later and, um, uh, at least one cool game that, um, or

07:17.540 --> 07:21.900
brand new game that I saw, um, well actually it was several brand new games, but one from

07:21.900 --> 07:26.340
like an indie developer, um, that was, uh, no man's sky that looked pretty awesome.

07:26.340 --> 07:31.500
It was kind of stole the show and at least that seems to be the consensus.

07:31.500 --> 07:37.340
Um, I saw that trailer cause I did not watch the VGX, but I, I, and I kind of always said,

07:37.340 --> 07:39.640
I'm like, any of the good stuff will be on YouTube afterwards.

07:39.640 --> 07:40.640
So yeah.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.520
I did see that trailer and it was, it was neat, but I couldn't like, I was like, well,

07:44.520 --> 07:45.520
what's the game?

07:45.520 --> 07:49.960
Like, you know, it looked neat how it was going from underwater to land, a sky to space

07:49.960 --> 07:53.360
in just like one fluid motion and the art style was very neat.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.480
So yeah, I was kind of like, Oh, this is neat, but what is it a shooter?

07:56.480 --> 07:58.440
Cause I see bullets being counted in the corner.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.720
Is it a, what the heck game is it?

08:00.720 --> 08:01.720
I don't know.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.720
Yeah.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.400
That's the only thing that kind of gets me about it is I'm like, all right, cool story,

08:05.400 --> 08:06.400
bro.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.640
What's the game?

08:07.640 --> 08:08.640
It just looks interesting.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.640
Yeah.

08:09.640 --> 08:13.880
And then, you know, I, I look forward to the next chapter and what this game's on.

08:13.880 --> 08:14.880
I'm not dissing the game.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.320
It looked really good, but I just, I'm curious, you know, well, okay.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.320
What else is there?

08:18.320 --> 08:19.320
Well, okay.

08:19.320 --> 08:24.920
So basically the, the main thing about this is there's been a lot of conflicting opinions

08:24.920 --> 08:29.680
about the show since this is going to kind of a whole change of venue for, you know,

08:29.680 --> 08:30.680
the VGAs.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.920
Now it's this new, there's no audience really.

08:33.920 --> 08:38.200
It's just kind of this studio set and they have developers on, they're interviewing them

08:38.200 --> 08:39.700
with different things.

08:39.700 --> 08:43.840
To me, it seemed like a very long version of, you know, their game trailers show that

08:43.840 --> 08:50.440
they normally have on, on Spike and except, you know, they gave out awards and they had

08:50.440 --> 08:54.880
Joel McHale and a lot of people didn't like Joel McHale because they thought he was just,

08:54.880 --> 08:59.560
you know, hating on the entire show and not taking anything seriously.

08:59.560 --> 09:04.320
And which, I mean, if you're a paid presenter, you're, I don't think that he's doing that

09:04.320 --> 09:05.320
on purpose.

09:05.320 --> 09:11.760
But whatever, um, and you know, he made some major faux pas as well.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.880
That should be called out.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.320
Like he, and to some people you may go, Oh, what's the big deal.

09:16.320 --> 09:21.800
But you know, again, if you're trying to break out of that whole machismo, you know, gaming

09:21.800 --> 09:25.200
culture and it's only for a certain type of people, especially coming off last week when

09:25.200 --> 09:28.620
we had a guest that was really talking about inclusive games, you know, Joel McHale made

09:28.620 --> 09:32.560
a pretty off joke in the first 10 minutes of the show, something about Wario getting

09:32.560 --> 09:39.160
a sex change, which can be construed as transphobic, which, you know, I realize there's a fine

09:39.160 --> 09:45.720
line between are we too sensitive about getting offended easily and you know, and so forth.

09:45.720 --> 09:51.720
But it's just kind of the thing where it's like, you know, I just, as a joke like that

09:51.720 --> 09:57.600
kind of just leaves me very like sour puss face when we're all about trying to include

09:57.600 --> 09:59.400
more people in gaming culture.

09:59.400 --> 10:04.400
Let's get away from gaming being just about dude bros and, and that sort of thing.

10:04.400 --> 10:09.760
But I don't know, maybe Spike TV feels some sort of allegiance to that demographic.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.760
I don't know.

10:10.760 --> 10:14.980
But I just, when I, again, I didn't watch it, but I heard about it and I was just kind

10:14.980 --> 10:15.980
of, I just kind of made a sour face.

10:15.980 --> 10:20.040
Well, some of the things like that he said were kind of ironic, I guess, because you

10:20.040 --> 10:23.600
know, the whole thing he's like, he's like, yeah, we're going to have lots of, you know,

10:23.600 --> 10:29.640
trailers and demos and basically stuff that you can consider one long giant, you know,

10:29.640 --> 10:31.600
video game commercial or something.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.120
And I understand that it's supposed to be a joke, but at the same time, that's kind

10:35.120 --> 10:36.120
of what this is.

10:36.120 --> 10:40.040
It's just a big fucking commercial for these games.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.840
And that's why the whole thing kind of seems like a joke in the first place.

10:42.840 --> 10:47.260
If you want to say even more of a joke than the VGA's were, at least the VGA's was actually

10:47.260 --> 10:52.060
presented like an award show and you could kind of imagine, or at least you make believe

10:52.060 --> 10:57.960
that it's an award show and not necessarily something that is used to drive certain properties

10:57.960 --> 11:01.320
ahead and good for marketing and that kind of stuff.

11:01.320 --> 11:05.860
But I just don't know, it's harder to take this seriously, especially when they come

11:05.860 --> 11:11.380
out of the gate looking like this and it looks ridiculous.

11:11.380 --> 11:15.300
It's kind of like, you know, if we had a bigger budget or like if someone had a bigger budget

11:15.300 --> 11:20.460
out there and just filmed themselves talking about what they think is the best games, even

11:20.460 --> 11:26.360
though I know that they had an internet poll to nail down some of those winners and stuff.

11:26.360 --> 11:30.020
But I just, I don't know, I can't really take it seriously.

11:30.020 --> 11:33.960
Let me ask this question, then why do we, as a gaming culture, I mean these things only

11:33.960 --> 11:40.120
have enough clout and power as we give it, why do we continue, and I'm even accusing

11:40.120 --> 11:42.760
ourselves here, why are we even talking about it?

11:42.760 --> 11:46.760
Why is gaming culture obsessed with this show?

11:46.760 --> 11:50.120
Because Spike TV clearly wrote it off, they'd rather air cops rerun it.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.920
I think people are more obsessed about the show because of the exclusive trailers and

11:53.920 --> 11:55.040
stuff that they show off.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.260
It's basically the new stuff that we get to see that people, I don't think really a lot

11:59.260 --> 12:06.700
of people, aside from getting an affirmation that, hey, X series that I like got an award

12:06.700 --> 12:11.500
or something like that, look, I'm justified in my liking this series or something, or

12:11.500 --> 12:12.500
complaining about that.

12:12.500 --> 12:19.620
The general video game culture conflict between different people and opinions and stuff like

12:19.620 --> 12:20.620
that.

12:20.620 --> 12:24.000
But for me, that's kind of one of the reasons I would tune in, is just because of the new

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
trailers.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.260
And yeah, I know I could swatch them online, which I was going to do, but I just saw that

12:28.260 --> 12:31.680
there was a link to a stream, oh yeah, I didn't know they were streaming that online, I checked

12:31.680 --> 12:36.840
out about 10 minutes of it, and thankfully saw that trailer for No Man's Sky, my son

12:36.840 --> 12:40.000
was watching too, and he's like, I want to see that trailer again, I want to see that

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
trailer again.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Let me get a couple comments here, Jamie.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.280
Well, I was just thinking that, part of me wonders how much of it is driven by sponsors.

12:48.280 --> 12:53.540
If they're getting X amount of revenue dollars, then they have a continued reason to keep

12:53.540 --> 12:57.380
doing it in whatever way they want to, as long as they keep getting the money in, right?

12:57.380 --> 12:58.380
Of course.

12:58.380 --> 12:59.380
Jason?

12:59.380 --> 13:03.520
I was just going to say, it's the leaving sports ball on in the background to watch

13:03.520 --> 13:05.340
the commercials effect.

13:05.340 --> 13:09.020
So you think a lot of people were watching it very passively, where it's like, well,

13:09.020 --> 13:10.760
it's a Saturday, there's nothing better.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.640
Award shows are long, and there's enough, it's something that you don't necessarily

13:14.640 --> 13:17.240
have to see just until you have to.

13:17.240 --> 13:21.180
So you can glean a lot of information by having it on and having it around in lieu

13:21.180 --> 13:25.220
of doing something else, but then as soon as they talk about a studio that you really

13:25.220 --> 13:29.660
enjoy or a game you're chomping at the bit to see more content of, it's like, okay, now

13:29.660 --> 13:33.180
I'm going to pay attention, I'm going to give my active attention to this instead of my

13:33.180 --> 13:34.180
passive attention.

13:34.180 --> 13:39.940
And also the thing kind of represents, a lot of people think Jeff is kind of a corporate

13:39.940 --> 13:46.660
sellout, especially with the whole Doritos and Mountain Dew thing, and they have him

13:46.660 --> 13:50.120
dress up like the Doritos pope and stuff.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.640
Well, this is almost like an example of corporate sellout type of thing.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.720
I'm going to say something that actually might surprise some people.

13:57.720 --> 14:04.280
I'm going to defend him a little bit, because I kind of think at his core, he is really

14:04.280 --> 14:05.560
not a sellout.

14:05.560 --> 14:12.140
I actually think at his core, he really is a gamer like you and me wanting to do a job

14:12.140 --> 14:13.180
out there.

14:13.180 --> 14:19.360
I think to some extent what's happened is, it's either this or nothing.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.940
And I think he kind of realizes that.

14:21.940 --> 14:25.600
In some ways, I think this was kind of a last ditch effort to kind of save this sort of

14:25.600 --> 14:26.600
thing on Spike.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.280
I mean, let's be real, it wasn't on TV.

14:29.280 --> 14:33.240
This thing was on its way out the door of broadcast TV or whatever.

14:33.240 --> 14:38.760
However they want to spin it, the reality is they showed cops reruns instead.

14:38.760 --> 14:43.300
So I kind of think at his core, he wants to do good things, but unfortunately there's

14:43.300 --> 14:49.060
only so much those sponsor people and the suits and the people that are so out of touch

14:49.060 --> 14:51.100
to this are willing to go.

14:51.100 --> 14:57.340
So maybe that's why he was open to the idea of turning to the internet and trying to let

14:57.340 --> 15:00.760
it sort of go a new direction and so forth.

15:00.760 --> 15:05.140
So I give him credit for that, but unfortunately it's kind of one of those, this was your chance

15:05.140 --> 15:06.140
and you blew it.

15:06.320 --> 15:10.960
Well here's the thing is, I don't think that it, why is everyone so situated on the fact

15:10.960 --> 15:13.400
that this stuff needs to be on TV?

15:13.400 --> 15:17.520
Most people nowadays, especially in the gaming community, don't watch a lot of TV.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.320
It's all about internet stuff now, all internet broadcast shows.

15:21.320 --> 15:26.560
Hell, you have people that used to be on TV like Adam Sessler doing web shows now.

15:26.560 --> 15:31.360
You know, I'm sure that he could easily, hell, he's backed by game trailers.

15:31.360 --> 15:36.040
He could easily go to game trailers and have his own damn show that's more serious and

15:36.460 --> 15:39.500
still has the same type of people on there.

15:39.500 --> 15:45.060
And he doesn't have to bow to the corporate sponsors of Spike or whatever, MTV, to have

15:45.060 --> 15:47.340
all this nonsense that's in there.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.660
That's what I think they need to do.

15:48.660 --> 15:53.640
There is definitely a way out of, it's not this or nothing, there's plenty of options

15:53.640 --> 15:54.640
out there.

15:54.640 --> 16:00.200
It's just they try to do it again, and props to Spike for at least still considering gaming

16:00.200 --> 16:05.140
as a viable thing to have on their network, because fuck, G4 just gave up on that.

16:05.780 --> 16:08.880
Let me go to the chatroom, because there's a lot of comments on this, of course, in the

16:08.880 --> 16:13.520
chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, it is the show where every gamer has a voice after all.

16:13.520 --> 16:17.120
ActDeaf says, again, take out Joel and it would have been fine.

16:17.120 --> 16:21.560
BlackWolf says, I like what they tried to do, but they needed to do it, not try.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.580
And I bet, again, that's a little bit of the battle between the suits and so forth.

16:25.580 --> 16:30.120
Bobby also goes on to say, you know, Jeff has done some amazing journalism stuff.

16:30.120 --> 16:34.160
Jeff's The Final Hours reporting is wonderful, and I think a lot, I don't know a lot of people

16:34.180 --> 16:35.180
that would argue with that.

16:35.180 --> 16:36.180
Exactly, and that's why it's kind of a disappointment.

16:36.180 --> 16:41.700
I mean, his game trailer show's good, you know, I have nothing bad to say about that.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.140
It's a great show.

16:43.140 --> 16:48.780
And it's just, it's kind of embarrassing that he's this good, and yet here's this.

16:48.780 --> 16:53.340
Here's a couple other comments that are really deep, and this is really good stuff.

16:53.340 --> 16:58.340
SSJ100Matt says, and this is in response to why do these awards even exist and so forth.

16:58.340 --> 17:03.980
SSJ100Matt says, because we're a society that needs a winner and a loser in something.

17:03.980 --> 17:07.840
Award shows in general give people validation that their favorite thing is better than other

17:07.840 --> 17:10.420
people's favorite thing.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.280
Be damned if that doesn't hit the nail on the head.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.280
100%.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.280
100%.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.280
Absolutely.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.420
I mean, and that's not even just games.

17:16.420 --> 17:18.280
I just talked about football a minute ago.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.560
I mean, isn't that kind of the big thing behind football?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.320
My team's better than your team, right?

17:22.320 --> 17:25.600
I mean, that's a lot of culture right there.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.120
They have even the Espys.

17:27.120 --> 17:30.480
Oh, yeah, well, yeah, and it's just not even, it's not even just that.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.480
The Oscars.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.560
Especially western culture.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.560
The Oscars, right?

17:34.560 --> 17:41.900
People get obsessed with being able to call the Oscar pool or whatever at work and that

17:41.900 --> 17:42.900
whole thing.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.780
I mean, that's just a part of culture.

17:44.780 --> 17:45.780
Absolutely.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.660
And especially in gaming.

17:47.660 --> 17:51.700
Xbox One fanboys versus Sony fanboys versus Nintendo fanboys.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.300
That absolutely goes on.

17:53.300 --> 17:57.380
Well, then you've got the other people who just laugh at them.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.380
Let's see.

17:58.380 --> 17:59.380
Also in our chat room.

17:59.760 --> 18:04.080
I was actually going to say, but even that in and of itself is sort of a, some people

18:04.080 --> 18:06.680
sort of get on their high horse about not being competitive.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.680
Right, right.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.680
Yeah, I know.

18:08.680 --> 18:09.680
Yeah, there is.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.680
I mean, you have to have a little fun with it and you know, it's, you don't want it to

18:12.680 --> 18:16.120
be the kind of thing where, oh, everybody wins an award because you know, I'm the kind

18:16.120 --> 18:22.840
of guy that owns every console and I give everybody a fair opportunity.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.240
I would like their income.

18:24.240 --> 18:29.200
You know, Dan and I, Dan and I used to be in that boat and now we just like, we're kind

18:29.220 --> 18:30.220
of like, we don't care anymore.

18:30.220 --> 18:31.220
I guess.

18:31.220 --> 18:34.660
Seriously, if I was making an income that he's probably making on, you know, that show,

18:34.660 --> 18:36.940
I will wear a fucking Doritos Pope hat.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.540
I don't care on TV.

18:39.540 --> 18:40.700
I will sell out.

18:40.700 --> 18:45.020
Akuma JP says my milkshake is better than yours.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.020
Could you teach me?

18:46.020 --> 18:47.020
Would you have to charge?

18:47.020 --> 18:48.620
I have more boys in the yard.

18:48.620 --> 18:52.780
Thank you for that, Jason.

18:52.780 --> 18:56.580
Uh, when you're the one just sprouted up, when you're editing this, when you're editing

18:56.600 --> 18:59.000
this week's show, be sure to crop out that little sense.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
All right.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.320
Uh, no, I really want to read this serious comment from Scott, a Tron, cause this is important

19:03.320 --> 19:07.480
to in our chairman at live.com Scott, a Tron says, Joel kept making jokes about gamers

19:07.480 --> 19:09.980
being virgins and living in their mother's basement.

19:09.980 --> 19:13.960
Exactly what gamers want to hear during an award show for the gaming industry.

19:13.960 --> 19:14.960
Just dumb.

19:14.960 --> 19:18.960
If you ask me and you know, I had that criticism.

19:18.960 --> 19:24.160
When I came back from gamer X, I had a few choice words to say about one of the monologues

19:24.180 --> 19:29.660
that I saw Pandora box give who, you know, she kind of made a lot of those jokes too.

19:29.660 --> 19:34.900
And I'm like, okay, Pandora, you might be at like a G L B T Q I that whole thing quilt

19:34.900 --> 19:35.900
bag or whatever it is.

19:35.900 --> 19:39.420
You might be at one of these types of conventions, but it's also a gaming convention.

19:39.420 --> 19:42.020
Don't get, don't get up here and offend gamers either.

19:42.020 --> 19:45.820
And that was something I, you know, as much as I love her and still do, I just was really

19:45.820 --> 19:46.820
put off by that.

19:46.820 --> 19:50.620
Uh, when I came back from that, I just think Joel's material, maybe he's a little old cause

19:50.620 --> 19:55.040
he was kind of doing that, you know, at the Ubisoft stuff when he, um, you know, was hosting

19:55.040 --> 19:56.040
that.

19:56.040 --> 20:01.240
It's just, it's getting new material, uh, but Rama counters with this and says, if geeks

20:01.240 --> 20:04.440
can't make fun of themselves, then what the fuck are we?

20:04.440 --> 20:05.440
But I don't know.

20:05.440 --> 20:11.640
I think it's a little bit different when it is someone that you count on to do it appropriately.

20:11.640 --> 20:12.640
Yeah, I agree.

20:12.640 --> 20:13.640
And I don't agree.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.640
Like I do agree.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.720
We have to be able to get offended a little bit and that's why I'm not here raging more

20:17.720 --> 20:20.600
about some of this, but it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, okay,

20:20.600 --> 20:23.820
the, you're living in your basement shit is old.

20:23.820 --> 20:24.820
It's old.

20:24.820 --> 20:25.820
Joke is old.

20:25.820 --> 20:26.820
Yeah.

20:26.820 --> 20:27.820
It's kind of like these jokes we've heard before.

20:27.820 --> 20:31.460
It's kind of like someone named Richard and someone calling him Dick is like, ah, yeah,

20:31.460 --> 20:32.860
I've never heard that before.

20:32.860 --> 20:39.580
You know, it's very sex change joke is just like you, you can do better than that.

20:39.580 --> 20:40.580
It's tacky.

20:40.580 --> 20:41.580
You can do better than that.

20:41.580 --> 20:45.300
Like, especially in this day and age, like you're smarter than that.

20:45.300 --> 20:50.180
It's like if you're going to go for the insulting jokes to be fun, to be funny, go from the

20:50.180 --> 20:55.480
Lampanelli page, but don't, you know, don't think that you're actually being funny.

20:55.480 --> 21:00.040
Go look at South Park cause I think that shit's really funny, but granted they offend everybody

21:00.040 --> 21:04.600
and it's just, but anyway, that show has gotten incredibly stupid.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.200
I don't know.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.880
The last few episodes are pretty good.

21:07.880 --> 21:08.880
All right.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.720
Um, anyhow, so, so whatever.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.440
I mean, again, I'm not, I'm not like, Oh my God, I'm so mad about the VGX.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.040
I'm not mad about the VGX by any means.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.040
Yeah.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.040
That's kind of where I'm at.

21:19.040 --> 21:23.380
I'm like literally asking the question where I'm like, why is this such a big fucking deal?

21:23.380 --> 21:26.820
Kind of disappointed that there wasn't anything like, you know, a fallout four trailer and

21:26.820 --> 21:30.060
it was just like, it's like, Hey, here's a new trailer for Titanfall.

21:30.060 --> 21:31.060
Yeah.

21:31.060 --> 21:32.060
Yeah.

21:32.060 --> 21:35.700
I wish there was more new game announcements, you know, it was just kind of like, you know,

21:35.700 --> 21:37.540
new trailers for games that we've already seen.

21:37.540 --> 21:41.340
Keep in mind, we're at the halfway point between E3's too.

21:41.340 --> 21:47.140
So I think there is definitely a, uh, a drive out there, a call for like a winter E3 type

21:47.140 --> 21:48.140
of thing.

21:48.140 --> 21:52.760
And I think the video game awards are a winter E3, a winty three, a wintry three, wintry

21:52.760 --> 21:53.760
three.

21:53.760 --> 21:54.760
Yeah.

21:54.760 --> 21:55.760
That type of thing.

21:55.760 --> 21:56.760
You know what I mean?

21:56.760 --> 21:59.080
Like a, like something, some news to be a tent pole between the different E3's, you

21:59.080 --> 22:03.560
know, just something to kind of keep us going until the next one.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.560
But I don't know.

22:04.560 --> 22:08.100
I felt the announcements that came out of previous, the, the, the VGX's or whatever

22:08.100 --> 22:10.120
were, were better, were stronger.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.120
You know what I mean?

22:11.120 --> 22:14.140
Then, then what we got this year, steam is more exciting.

22:14.140 --> 22:16.620
Steam sales are a lot more exciting.

22:16.620 --> 22:20.880
I probably shouldn't ask this question, but it just kind of spring to mind listening to

22:20.880 --> 22:21.880
this.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.840
Collectively, the four of us, are we out of touch?

22:25.840 --> 22:31.680
No, Jason, because we're gamers and this is, this is, this is something we talked about

22:31.680 --> 22:32.860
a little bit last week.

22:32.860 --> 22:36.560
I don't think we're out of, I don't think we're out of touch because again, the crux

22:36.560 --> 22:38.680
of the show is where every gamer has a voice.

22:38.680 --> 22:39.680
We are gamers.

22:39.680 --> 22:40.680
We have voices.

22:40.680 --> 22:41.680
We use them.

22:41.680 --> 22:46.160
So maybe that, maybe that's the wrong question to ask, but I, I really wish I could remember

22:46.160 --> 22:49.460
the detail of something that I was thinking about in one of these last couple of weeks,

22:49.460 --> 22:52.940
but basically what it boils down to is that there are, there are obviously multiple sides

22:52.940 --> 22:56.700
to everything and there is nothing, there is nothing wrong with, with one individual's

22:56.700 --> 22:57.820
opinion against the other.

22:57.820 --> 23:02.120
They're both right, despite the points we just made five minutes ago.

23:02.120 --> 23:08.920
But it's kind of like we, it's, it seems weird to me because collectively we've said the

23:08.920 --> 23:12.940
same, it feels like we've said the same thing for a month, a big collective sigh at the

23:12.940 --> 23:20.260
future, despite the fact that consoles continue to shatter all records constantly, console

23:20.260 --> 23:21.260
sales and everything.

23:21.260 --> 23:25.540
So out of touches, that was definitely the wrong question to ask, but I want to, it would

23:25.540 --> 23:34.780
be very interesting to find how we, how we deviated from the fact that almost all of

23:34.780 --> 23:39.340
us, if not all of us owned every console of the last generation, it was like, you know,

23:39.340 --> 23:43.780
we grew up, we grew up with our parents and we had the one that we wanted or the one that

23:43.780 --> 23:45.420
our parents got us.

23:45.420 --> 23:48.380
And then we grew up more and we, we went for more and more.

23:48.380 --> 23:53.200
And then we had jobs and we had income and we invested in the entire generation and took

23:53.200 --> 23:54.200
everything in.

23:54.200 --> 23:58.420
And now we're here, the door is open, we can do what we want and we'll get there.

23:58.420 --> 24:03.500
But let me tell you where I think your viewpoint skewed a little bit because I mean, I, I get

24:03.500 --> 24:06.820
where you're going with, with this, but there's, there's a couple of things that caught my

24:06.820 --> 24:07.820
ear there.

24:07.820 --> 24:11.140
One is that it's not that the future looks bleak for gaming.

24:11.140 --> 24:12.660
I don't believe that.

24:12.660 --> 24:16.680
It's just none of us were ready to jump on the bandwagon right now.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.420
There's not the games to justify that right now.

24:19.420 --> 24:22.380
But to say the future looks bleak, not necessarily.

24:22.380 --> 24:27.140
There's some very exciting things on the horizon and, and we continue to push things forward.

24:27.140 --> 24:28.900
I'll give you a great example, Jason.

24:28.900 --> 24:32.780
It's something we don't talk about enough here on the show, the Oculus Rift.

24:32.780 --> 24:34.020
Really freaking cool, right?

24:34.020 --> 24:35.980
I know Bobby Blackwell's gonna back me up on that.

24:35.980 --> 24:42.020
That quite literally changes everything because it was done, it was done to an incredibly

24:42.020 --> 24:47.460
limited extent in the nineties and then it meaningfully disappeared until last year.

24:47.460 --> 24:49.100
So does the future of gaming look bleak?

24:49.100 --> 24:50.100
No.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.900
As we get one step closer to the holodeck, the future of gaming looks awesome.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.700
It is awesome because now we're going to get a new lawnmower man movie.

24:55.700 --> 24:59.580
But do they, but do they, do they need my money right now?

24:59.580 --> 25:00.580
I don't think so.

25:00.580 --> 25:04.260
Jason, if you think back to those consoles you did have as a kid, how many of them did

25:04.260 --> 25:07.340
your family really get on launch day?

25:07.340 --> 25:08.340
I know my family.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.340
Yes.

25:09.340 --> 25:10.340
We had a Super Nintendo.

25:10.340 --> 25:11.340
We had a Nintendo.

25:11.340 --> 25:12.340
I got a PlayStation.

25:12.340 --> 25:15.040
None of those consoles did I have in the first year.

25:15.040 --> 25:18.260
And in some cases, I think a Super Nintendo was out for like three years before I got

25:18.260 --> 25:19.260
one.

25:19.260 --> 25:22.220
I have never owned a console on launch day.

25:22.220 --> 25:25.260
See when you're, when you're the big kid and you get to make the purchases, then you get

25:25.260 --> 25:27.220
to, you know, kind of make some more of those decisions.

25:27.220 --> 25:31.100
So it's not that we don't support the next generation of gaming by not getting those

25:31.100 --> 25:32.100
consoles right away.

25:32.100 --> 25:33.100
We just get there eventually.

25:33.100 --> 25:36.980
I just go, the realistic is, you know, now I've got to juggle the rest of the bills and

25:36.980 --> 25:37.980
so on.

25:37.980 --> 25:38.980
Anyway, Jamie, I know you're done.

25:38.980 --> 25:42.380
Here's the other thing too, is that we have experience to back us up where we have been

25:42.380 --> 25:46.840
there for system launches and we have gotten things close to launch window.

25:46.840 --> 25:52.260
You know, I mean, Dan and I waited in line for our, um, our Dreamcast.

25:52.260 --> 25:57.180
I waited in line for a Wii, you know, actually Kristen and I bribed our place in line.

25:57.180 --> 26:02.660
In line at target with, with Krispy Kreme, um, you know, the other systems, Dan was able

26:02.660 --> 26:07.740
to get day one because he managed a GameStop, you know, we've had the ends.

26:07.740 --> 26:14.200
We took advantage of it, but now it's like we have that experience of the disappointment

26:14.200 --> 26:15.200
that's come afterwards.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.200
Well, okay.

26:16.200 --> 26:20.260
The, the Chinese weren't off Dan's done with, you know, Twilight princess.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.260
What do we do now?

26:21.260 --> 26:28.540
Um, I could sit here and try to play, uh, trauma center on Vicodin cause that was right

26:28.540 --> 26:32.420
after my surgery too, you know, sorry, go ahead.

26:32.420 --> 26:37.740
I'm just saying that a lot of the people that you see waiting in line now aren't people

26:37.740 --> 26:42.700
who have more done, you know, maybe game launch weights or have had people to do the weight

26:42.700 --> 26:48.300
for them, but now they're getting the experience of getting it home and then going, well, what

26:48.300 --> 26:50.180
do I do now?

26:50.180 --> 26:53.660
You know, what's really funny that I'm just now realizing, cause I'm thinking through

26:53.660 --> 26:56.940
in my head, like, what did I buy on launch day and what did I buy in the launch window

26:56.940 --> 26:58.260
and so forth?

26:58.260 --> 27:04.660
And every system that I bought on launch day, every single one of them that I had on the

27:04.660 --> 27:08.540
launch day that I actually said, you know what, I'm going to buy this purchase.

27:08.540 --> 27:11.820
Do you, I bet you can guess, do you know what they all have in common?

27:11.820 --> 27:18.780
No, uh, actually, actually, yes.

27:18.780 --> 27:19.780
Compilations slash history.

27:19.780 --> 27:27.020
No, no, they're all Nintendo, which isn't, which isn't going to do the, the people that

27:27.020 --> 27:31.340
call me a fan boy and he, and that whole thing, any favors, but just real it, I'm going to

27:31.340 --> 27:32.340
fess up.

27:32.340 --> 27:35.860
I'm, I think that I bought a Wii U on launch day, I bought a Wii on launch day, I bought

27:35.860 --> 27:41.020
a DS on launch day, I bought a 3DS on launch day, uh, I didn't buy a GameCube on launch.

27:41.020 --> 27:45.580
I didn't know I didn't buy that, but you know, of, you know, of the games, the systems

27:45.580 --> 27:48.620
I can think of that I actually did punk down the money on, um, on launch day, they were

27:48.620 --> 27:50.140
all Nintendo.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.820
And I'm trying to think in my head right now, like, well, why is that Rob?

27:52.820 --> 27:55.820
Why did you buy those systems, but yet you wouldn't do it for the PlayStation four so

27:55.820 --> 27:56.820
forth.

27:56.820 --> 28:01.400
And again, it's about the games that were out and we, you had a Mario game I really

28:01.400 --> 28:06.900
wanted to play and it had the zombie you and, and you know that the, we had Zelda, you know,

28:06.900 --> 28:10.900
and amongst that was the big decider for me and so on and so on.

28:10.900 --> 28:16.000
You know, and 3DS and DS were a little bit different granted, but you know, they were

28:16.000 --> 28:17.780
strong enough where I bought one on launch day.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.740
Did I buy a Vita on launch day?

28:19.740 --> 28:22.660
I don't think I did, but I bought it really close.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.420
So Vita was close.

28:24.420 --> 28:30.980
Well Dan and Dan and I, um, before that, cause he had gotten his Saturn at launch and I think

28:30.980 --> 28:35.580
he, yeah, Dan got his Saturn at launch and we got our Dreamcast at launch and we got

28:35.580 --> 28:38.900
an import Dreamcast soon after Japanese launch.

28:38.900 --> 28:43.220
Um, so we were like that with everything Sega did.

28:43.220 --> 28:46.500
One thing I haven't brought up on the show in a while is that I kind of took a siesta

28:46.500 --> 28:47.500
during that.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.220
Like I wasn't like when I was in college, I actually, I was going through some other

28:50.220 --> 28:53.500
stuff personally, so I actually wasn't as big of a gamer during that period.

28:53.500 --> 28:59.020
So I kind of missed the, uh, the Dreamcast launch probably right on up to the PlayStation

28:59.020 --> 29:00.020
two launch.

29:00.020 --> 29:03.900
I think that finally started to bring me back in the fold thanks to DDR and everything.

29:03.900 --> 29:07.180
And then I got into this show, which really got me back into video games again.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.920
But uh, I kind of missed a gap there.

29:08.920 --> 29:12.180
So, but I kind of feel like if I was gaming, I would have bought a Dreamcast on launch

29:12.180 --> 29:15.180
day.

29:15.180 --> 29:16.180
I have to tell you the truth.

29:16.180 --> 29:18.420
That was actually one of the most fun launches I've attended.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.420
No, I bet.

29:19.420 --> 29:20.420
Loki, any thoughts?

29:20.420 --> 29:23.180
Um, we kind of strayed a little bit from the original topic.

29:23.180 --> 29:24.740
I'm sorry, but this is good stuff.

29:24.740 --> 29:26.420
I would blame Jason for that.

29:26.420 --> 29:27.420
My fault.

29:27.420 --> 29:28.420
Yeah.

29:28.420 --> 29:33.220
Um, I bought, well, I didn't buy anything this generation will for launch stuff otherwise.

29:33.220 --> 29:39.340
Um, but the PlayStation, Xbox 360 wasn't quite at launch because they were sold out.

29:39.340 --> 29:42.900
And so I got one from Craigslist and so I got that near launch.

29:42.900 --> 29:48.020
I mean, it was pretty close, but I bought like almost the entire library of launch games

29:48.020 --> 29:49.020
when they came out.

29:49.020 --> 29:54.820
So, I mean, and I was vastly disappointed by a lot of them because it was just like,

29:54.820 --> 29:57.500
eh, it's not that great, but I don't know.

29:57.500 --> 30:02.700
Assuming I can budget again, I will have a PlayStation for January, February next year

30:02.700 --> 30:04.980
is when I'm looking to get my PlayStation for Xbox.

30:04.980 --> 30:08.820
One will be like late summer, probably the holiday season console.

30:08.820 --> 30:12.860
I'm just like, I don't even really, I still don't really need a PlayStation forward.

30:12.860 --> 30:14.340
Like there's nothing upcoming.

30:14.340 --> 30:15.340
Infamous looks good.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.340
That's for me.

30:16.340 --> 30:17.340
For me there is though.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.540
And we'll get to it later in the show.

30:19.540 --> 30:25.500
Well, I was also going to say there's some, uh, you know, some chatter in here about,

30:25.500 --> 30:28.500
you know, different people having different systems at launch.

30:28.500 --> 30:34.340
The other thing too, that made system launches different for me and Dan was that when the

30:34.340 --> 30:37.820
last gen came out, he was managing a GameStop.

30:37.820 --> 30:40.940
So it wasn't like we had to go and wait in line.

30:40.940 --> 30:45.980
He could just go to the store and pick it up, you know, it'd be behind the desk.

30:45.980 --> 30:49.900
We weren't going to, the only reason we waited in line for the Wii, I waited in line for

30:49.900 --> 30:52.320
the Wii is because we weren't originally going to get one.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.860
So we had no order on it.

30:53.860 --> 30:57.580
And then we were trying to, you know, wait in line for OLR.

30:57.580 --> 30:58.580
That was fun though.

30:58.580 --> 30:59.580
It was kind of fun.

30:59.580 --> 31:01.460
I had a good time hanging out with Kristen that night.

31:01.460 --> 31:06.580
And then there were the people that were walking, no, he wasn't that one with us, but then there

31:06.580 --> 31:10.060
were the people walking up at, you know, eight in the morning right here to buy one.

31:10.060 --> 31:11.060
Sorry.

31:11.060 --> 31:12.580
We only have enough for the people who were in line.

31:12.580 --> 31:13.580
Anyhow.

31:13.580 --> 31:14.580
All right.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.500
Uh, good reminiscing, good stories.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.700
We got a little bit off topic though.

31:17.700 --> 31:21.180
I want to get into our gaming weeks so we can get into what's going on in gaming news

31:21.180 --> 31:22.180
this week.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.260
Uh, so let's get into how was your gaming week, the types of video games that you have

31:25.260 --> 31:29.700
been playing this week, whatever system it's on, uh, or PC, uh, dark Sakura.

31:29.700 --> 31:33.020
I played some final fantasy, uh, 14.

31:33.020 --> 31:41.140
Um, I thought about eight and then I went, lol, no, um, we, uh, what else did I play?

31:41.140 --> 31:46.340
I actually started playing Mass Effect 2 again, just because I wanted more stuff to caption.

31:46.340 --> 31:47.980
Um, what is it?

31:47.980 --> 31:48.980
Oh yeah.

31:48.980 --> 31:49.980
Animal crossing.

31:49.980 --> 31:50.980
I'm still playing Zelda.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.860
I'm taking my sweet time with it.

31:52.980 --> 31:58.260
Um, I, I think I'm five songs away from having a complete song list in animal crossing now.

31:58.260 --> 31:59.260
Nice.

31:59.260 --> 32:00.260
Yeah.

32:00.260 --> 32:04.220
Um, we, uh, crap, what else was it that I played?

32:04.220 --> 32:05.220
Oh yeah.

32:05.220 --> 32:07.460
I tried to play bust to move universe again and it's just awful.

32:07.460 --> 32:08.460
I tried to like it.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.380
It's, it just was not good.

32:10.380 --> 32:13.700
It's clearly the reason it was $14 brand new.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.580
It's just hard to see.

32:15.580 --> 32:21.220
And then, um, I, uh, yeah, I think that's about it.

32:21.220 --> 32:25.660
I kept going back and, uh, checking the, uh, roster list for Namco High cause I'm really

32:25.660 --> 32:27.300
looking forward to playing it.

32:27.300 --> 32:28.300
All right.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.620
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

32:31.620 --> 32:34.300
Um, this week I played more Grand Theft Auto.

32:34.300 --> 32:38.900
Um, did a little bit more online on the 360.

32:38.900 --> 32:42.420
Got my character up to, I think, level 20, which is weird.

32:42.420 --> 32:46.700
See, it kind of sucks that they've nerfed everything cause it, it's taken me so much

32:46.700 --> 32:51.260
longer to get up to like level 20 on the Xbox 360 than it has on PlayStation 3 where

32:51.260 --> 32:53.260
I was playing it a lot more.

32:53.260 --> 32:57.620
And like on PlayStation 3, I think I'm up to like 28 or 30 or something.

32:57.620 --> 33:04.340
Um, so it's kind of hard to get them all high level, especially when I split my time between

33:04.340 --> 33:06.380
two different versions of the game.

33:06.380 --> 33:08.380
Um, let's see.

33:08.380 --> 33:13.080
Other things I played, I played a little Minecraft, um, this week just when I didn't have any

33:13.080 --> 33:16.580
internet, um, at work and stuff.

33:16.580 --> 33:22.420
And it's as grindy and, I don't know, as it's been, so.

33:22.420 --> 33:25.980
But there's horses and, uh, I haven't really done anything with the horses.

33:25.980 --> 33:28.340
They just taunt me from outside the window.

33:28.340 --> 33:35.060
Um, and then I did, uh, as I was, uh, kind of hyping up last week, I did get to play

33:35.060 --> 33:41.440
some of the, um, final beta tests for Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.440
It's fantastic.

33:42.440 --> 33:47.120
I mean, the game is pretty old, but, um, I was gonna say, we're on Just Cause 3 at this

33:47.120 --> 33:48.120
point, aren't we?

33:48.120 --> 33:49.360
No, they haven't put out number three yet.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.360
Oh, I thought we were.

33:50.360 --> 33:55.040
No, that's, uh, hopefully gonna be worked on, but clearly it's a series I've overlooked

33:55.040 --> 33:56.040
a bit.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.040
Sorry.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.040
Yeah, like Rent There's Auto.

33:58.040 --> 34:04.080
Um, I would say though, it's pretty amazing what they've done with this game.

34:04.080 --> 34:08.560
They, they have a game that was a single player game and they turned it into almost like an

34:08.560 --> 34:09.560
MMO.

34:10.160 --> 34:15.200
There were, there are literally hundreds of people online at a time.

34:15.200 --> 34:21.400
Um, I think the lowest I saw it was about 800 people in one game on one server, 800

34:21.400 --> 34:22.400
people.

34:22.400 --> 34:27.200
And then the most was like 1400 people on one server, all playing together at the same

34:27.200 --> 34:28.200
time.

34:28.200 --> 34:32.760
Yeah, granted there was a few lag issues here and there, but it wasn't super terrible.

34:32.760 --> 34:38.160
Um, the only thing it's like, I haven't played Just Cause 2 in a long time, so, you know,

34:38.160 --> 34:41.340
the weapons are kind of limited and, you know, there's not a whole ton of vehicles,

34:41.340 --> 34:43.760
but you can like buy your own weapons in game.

34:43.760 --> 34:48.160
You kill people and you get money and you, or you can do races and get money that way.

34:48.160 --> 34:54.080
Um, you know, you can jump to different places like teleport or you can, um, you know, join

34:54.080 --> 34:59.080
races and you know, literally it'll just teleport you once you have enough people for a race

34:59.080 --> 35:04.280
and you do the race and you earn money and you can buy vehicles, weapons, different player

35:04.280 --> 35:07.920
skins and it's just, it's amazing what they've done.

35:07.920 --> 35:12.920
And they even had at one point a thing, although it was disabled the last time I played this

35:12.920 --> 35:16.200
afternoon, but they had a thing to boost your vehicle speed.

35:16.200 --> 35:21.400
So you can type in, you know, slash boost and then set it from, you know, 0.5 or you

35:21.400 --> 35:23.640
know, 1.0 boost up to 20.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.400
And so if like you hit the gas and hit the boost, you can like launch.

35:26.400 --> 35:31.080
I was flying in a, in a boat because I hit a wave or something like that and I was just

35:31.080 --> 35:35.200
like, I went into the sky and it wasn't coming down.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.440
But I mean, it's awesome because not only, you know, are you, you know, flying around

35:39.440 --> 35:44.000
that stuff, but just cause you have like this grappling hook so you can, you know, grapple

35:44.000 --> 35:49.080
onto things and planes and it's just fun and the game is super cheap.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.840
So seriously, if they're launching the full version of the game later on this month, we'll

35:52.840 --> 35:56.960
talk about that a little later, but the game itself is like two bucks.

35:56.960 --> 35:57.960
It's like three bucks.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.720
I think it's $2.99 on Steam.

36:00.720 --> 36:04.480
Pick that game up and then definitely if you can pick up the multiplayer mod, hopefully

36:04.480 --> 36:07.760
it's not going to be, I don't think it's gonna be that expensive, but you know, if

36:07.760 --> 36:12.020
it's running pretty decent as it is with 1400 people with one server, when they open that

36:12.020 --> 36:15.660
up and have a lot more servers, it's going to be pretty amazing.

36:15.660 --> 36:20.560
So and I mean, I had, you know, the frame rate dropped a little bit when you have like

36:20.560 --> 36:24.200
hundreds of people in one spot, but it wasn't too bad.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.840
It was playable and it was a lot of fun.

36:25.840 --> 36:30.000
I definitely gave me quite a big grin.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Neo Planet.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
A lot of fun.

36:32.320 --> 36:36.080
Since I can't kill anybody in Grand Theft Auto Online without being penalized for it,

36:36.080 --> 36:40.600
which is kind of lame, but this game, kill, kill, kill, kill, you know, crash things into

36:40.600 --> 36:45.080
each other and it's all sorts of chaos.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.000
All right.

36:47.000 --> 36:53.240
Uh, busy, busy with you then, uh, with, uh, Just Cause multiplayer and, uh, is there like

36:53.240 --> 36:58.000
a, is there a faction or some way that all the VoG people can play with you or, um, well,

36:58.000 --> 37:02.320
not right now because it's just a beta test, but you can create your own factions and join

37:02.320 --> 37:03.400
up and stuff like that.

37:03.400 --> 37:07.640
So that might be something we can do later on, especially because right now I would be

37:07.640 --> 37:12.040
pretty hard to like stay together because it's a huge map and you kind of spawn into

37:12.040 --> 37:13.280
random locations.

37:13.280 --> 37:19.120
You can teleport to different places, but you know, it could, it's very easy to lose

37:19.120 --> 37:20.760
each other in that game.

37:20.760 --> 37:21.760
It was funny though.

37:21.760 --> 37:26.400
There was one guy like I had jumped onto his boat and he drove off and so I stayed on his

37:26.400 --> 37:29.760
hood for a while and then he kind of followed me around for a while.

37:29.760 --> 37:33.720
And then like, you know, later on I was playing through and I passed by him, you know, parachuting

37:33.720 --> 37:34.720
and stuff.

37:34.720 --> 37:39.280
So I don't know, it'll be fun once, uh, once they launch it officially.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.280
All right.

37:40.280 --> 37:43.320
Uh, Jason, do you have something you want to share this week?

37:43.320 --> 37:50.040
I I'm sure this came up when it actually came out, but have we like actually talked about

37:50.040 --> 37:57.640
the, uh, the Miiverse 3DS, uh, the, the, the DLC for lack of a better word for bonus games?

37:57.640 --> 37:58.760
Not really in depth.

37:58.760 --> 37:59.760
So go for it.

37:59.760 --> 38:05.720
I actually, it occurred to me this week when I was like really drawing out my ability to

38:05.720 --> 38:06.720
play those.

38:06.720 --> 38:12.640
Um, it's actually, those games are insane amounts of fun, but the problem is like Street

38:12.640 --> 38:16.160
Pass, they rely on you passing people to actually generate it.

38:16.160 --> 38:21.240
Um, I may have mentioned on the show sometime before that I have a router at home that takes

38:21.240 --> 38:27.680
advantage of Nintendo's remote Street Pass feature where somebody will, somebody's data,

38:27.680 --> 38:31.720
Nintendo will save somebody's Mi data at a hotspot.

38:31.720 --> 38:36.400
And then when you go to that hotspot, you get their Mi data, your Mi goes in place.

38:36.400 --> 38:40.560
And so you can actually start to proliferate at least a little bit more in the community.

38:40.560 --> 38:45.720
And they're supposed to be doing something like, uh, a Starbucks, a McDonald's in Europe

38:45.760 --> 38:50.120
and a McDonald's in America at the same time, we'll swap data across regions, that kind

38:50.120 --> 38:51.120
of stuff.

38:51.120 --> 38:55.440
So I have a router that masquerades that and I get, you know, for, for Miiverse, I get,

38:55.440 --> 39:03.160
uh, 10 Mi's in not even 10 minutes and it, it really makes those games shine.

39:03.160 --> 39:07.080
And especially like Mi Force, just how in depth it really is.

39:07.080 --> 39:19.160
Um, I always forget the name of the, the, uh, Ninja, um, I can, yeah, I can never remember

39:19.160 --> 39:23.120
the fourth game, but just a rock, paper, scissors.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.120
Yeah.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.880
It's lit that, that is, I thought I would like that game the most, but it is literally

39:26.880 --> 39:30.600
just a grind fest for, for troops, um, rock, paper, scissors.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.600
Yeah, whatever.

39:31.640 --> 39:36.320
Monster Manor, uh, uh, Flower, wow.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.320
I'm forgetting all of these.

39:37.320 --> 39:38.320
Aren't I?

39:38.320 --> 39:39.320
The Flower.

39:39.320 --> 39:40.320
Yeah.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.120
The Warriors way with the rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.120
Thank you.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.120
And then Mi Force.

39:45.120 --> 39:48.080
The other three are insane amounts of fun and I did not expect them to be.

39:48.080 --> 39:52.660
So I have actually been really nursing those games this week because it takes me like two

39:52.660 --> 39:56.880
to three weeks in San Francisco to be able to pick up 10 Mi's, which kind of surprises

39:56.880 --> 39:57.880
me.

39:57.880 --> 39:58.880
Um.

39:58.880 --> 39:59.880
Tiger Claw is very curious.

39:59.880 --> 40:00.880
How do you set up a router to do that?

40:00.880 --> 40:02.560
Does it have to be a specific brand or model?

40:02.560 --> 40:08.160
It does because you have to be able to change the router's Mac address.

40:08.160 --> 40:16.660
Um, because that's the, uh, the 3DS has to communicate to the internet and Nintendo themselves

40:16.660 --> 40:20.760
stores Mi data and a Mac address.

40:20.760 --> 40:25.240
So the Mac address, uh, there's a, there's a community, basically a homebrew community

40:25.240 --> 40:26.880
that revolves around this.

40:26.880 --> 40:31.920
Um, I can send you a ton of links, um, and I will do that shortly.

40:31.920 --> 40:36.280
I think the router I bought was like 40 bucks and there's plenty of alternatives, uh, around

40:36.280 --> 40:37.280
as well.

40:37.280 --> 40:42.040
So as I predicted I was going to do this week, as far as having time to sit down and game,

40:42.040 --> 40:43.200
that did not happen.

40:43.200 --> 40:48.240
I was training a new hire this week, which means my time was, you know, split between

40:48.240 --> 40:51.160
my own daily duties as well as getting him up to speed.

40:51.160 --> 40:56.560
And then all the fun things of dinner at work and all that kind of stuff, which meant that

40:56.560 --> 41:00.840
I got back to the place that I'm staying at like 11 o'clock or midnight every single

41:00.840 --> 41:01.840
night.

41:01.840 --> 41:02.840
But you've been working on something for a while.

41:02.840 --> 41:07.640
I have in the time that I did manage to have and then finished off on Saturday because

41:07.640 --> 41:09.440
everything lightened up yesterday.

41:09.440 --> 41:15.460
I actually sat down and at, um, I want to say it was dark touch Tetsuya's suggestion,

41:15.460 --> 41:17.800
but I don't recall who actually said it last week.

41:17.800 --> 41:23.480
Somebody said in chat that it's great that we're putting this on YouTube as well, but

41:23.480 --> 41:28.040
can you take some advantage of visual content, ie classic game of the week?

41:28.040 --> 41:32.840
I sat that I was like, that's a great idea and it's totally doable.

41:32.840 --> 41:37.720
So I took the show, I took, uh, I got some of the resources from what Rob has done on

41:37.720 --> 41:39.280
the previous episode.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.800
And I, I wanted to do, I have a lot more ideas.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.200
I just didn't have the time to do with this.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.200
You're just dipping your big toe in.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.200
So I was like, you know, okay.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.200
Yay.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.200
Yay.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.200
You got the classic game.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.200
Plus learning video editing and everything else.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.200
That's the first.

41:51.200 --> 41:55.840
I took the video that Rob was playing in studio for marble madness while Jamie was talking

41:55.840 --> 41:56.840
about it.

41:56.840 --> 42:02.120
And I spliced it into the video stream after the fact based off the audio that was going

42:02.120 --> 42:08.000
on, it was time consuming as all hell and frustrating at times, but I'm really, really

42:08.000 --> 42:09.440
pleased with how it came out.

42:09.440 --> 42:13.240
It's the only inner content of the video, but there is more in store.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.240
All right.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.560
Well, thank you for volunteering to take over the YouTube channel.

42:17.560 --> 42:18.560
Essentially.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.560
It's going to be great.

42:19.560 --> 42:22.520
We've gotten a little, a little bit of feedback on YouTube, and I think people looking forward

42:22.520 --> 42:26.400
to seeing, you know, what we can do there and who knows, you know, I know I've said

42:26.400 --> 42:30.400
my piece about, I don't know if talking heads during the show is the most interesting thing

42:30.400 --> 42:31.400
in the world.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.880
I know I've said my piece on that, but who knows?

42:32.880 --> 42:38.320
I might, I might be swayed in 2014 things are a Bruin, you know, and if we can't think

42:38.320 --> 42:44.600
of anything, we can just always fill the rest of the video full of YTMD strobing, you know,

42:44.600 --> 42:47.120
the whole works for me, works for me.

42:47.120 --> 42:52.600
Bobby Black Wolf, our, uh, our, uh, guy that's on before us here at, uh, the voice keys network.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.400
He says in chat, I'm a little jealous.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.960
So LR gets all these people to do things for them.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.560
Oh, Bobby.

42:59.560 --> 43:06.480
I've if it's any consolation, it took me a decade to realize that I can contribute.

43:06.480 --> 43:07.480
So now I am.

43:07.480 --> 43:08.480
Well, thank you.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.480
We appreciate it.

43:09.480 --> 43:10.480
Really do.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.480
All right.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.640
Uh, anyhow, let's, uh, talk about my gaming week.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.240
I actually don't have a whole lot to share with my gaming week.

43:16.240 --> 43:18.280
Um, Oh gosh, what could I talk about?

43:18.280 --> 43:21.480
Well, you know, I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14, like a true addict.

43:21.480 --> 43:25.840
Uh, luckily I'm not the only podcaster addicted to this stuff just before tonight's show.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.080
I was helping my buddy, uh, who's one of the hosts on Koopa club.

43:29.080 --> 43:30.080
I was helping him.

43:30.080 --> 43:33.360
Uh, Jonko was one of the hosts over there and I was helping him with some of the things

43:33.360 --> 43:36.880
you have to do when you're level 50, uh, like the primal battles and so forth.

43:36.880 --> 43:40.480
I will say this as far as Final Fantasy 14 goes, cause it's not in the show world tonight.

43:40.480 --> 43:47.200
Uh, there was a new trailer for the patch, uh, the patch 2.1 that hits Monday after next.

43:47.200 --> 43:51.160
Uh, there's a new trailer that was out this week for that 10 minute trailer cause it shows

43:51.160 --> 43:52.880
like a little bit of all the stuff that's new.

43:52.880 --> 43:56.960
There's a lot of, and it kind of needs it as much as I love Final Fantasy 14, the end

43:56.960 --> 43:58.680
game content's pretty thin.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.920
So they're really beefing that up with this new patch.

44:00.920 --> 44:01.920
That's very exciting.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.020
So happy to see it.

44:03.020 --> 44:04.680
Did you finish your lightning quests?

44:04.680 --> 44:06.720
No, I failed on that.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.000
I accidentally did them.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.960
I did the first one and I slacked off on the others.

44:10.960 --> 44:14.260
So I actually have a few screens of what lightning looks like in game.

44:14.260 --> 44:18.280
The good news is if you didn't do the lightning quest, they will be back in February when

44:18.280 --> 44:20.520
lightning returns comes out in the US.

44:20.520 --> 44:24.040
So there you'll, you'll get a second shot to do those and there'll probably be more

44:24.040 --> 44:26.200
people that are new to the game and so forth at that point.

44:26.200 --> 44:29.480
Uh, so I've been playing an awful lot of that randomly this week.

44:29.480 --> 44:32.600
I'll talk about a random game I played this week.

44:32.600 --> 44:36.440
Um, so you know how there was that WB bundle that was on sale a few weeks ago and I've

44:36.440 --> 44:37.820
had the key in steam.

44:37.820 --> 44:41.340
So I was like, the other night, you know, I had, I didn't want to play MMOs cause I'm

44:41.340 --> 44:42.840
like, all right, I've hit my limit on MMOs.

44:42.840 --> 44:45.940
I need to play something else to, to just, you know, cleanse the pallet a little bit

44:45.940 --> 44:47.260
and do something else in games.

44:47.260 --> 44:53.060
I played Batman Arkham Asylum, like I partied like it was what, 2009 or whenever that game

44:53.060 --> 44:54.180
came out.

44:54.180 --> 44:59.000
But uh, that's, it was neat because I, I, it was the first time I played it on PC versus

44:59.000 --> 45:03.880
a console and it runs really nice on my PC with the really crisp graphics and I could

45:03.880 --> 45:05.420
just use an Xbox 360 controller.

45:05.420 --> 45:07.180
So it's just like playing on console.

45:07.180 --> 45:13.060
And it was great to go back and experience that again and it's that game and, and um,

45:13.060 --> 45:16.260
you know, Arkham city and I haven't played the new one yet, but I know those first two

45:16.260 --> 45:18.540
at least are so well put together.

45:18.540 --> 45:21.740
Like they're, they're, they do such justice to the Batman comics.

45:21.740 --> 45:25.540
I think, I mean, I know not everybody may agree, but you know, if you're more of a fan

45:25.540 --> 45:28.600
of like the animated series and the comics and all that, any of those games do it so

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
well.

45:29.600 --> 45:33.160
And uh, Mark Hamill does a great joker of course in the, I know he wasn't in the most

45:33.160 --> 45:35.020
recent one, but in the earlier ones.

45:35.020 --> 45:39.900
I watched Dan play through the, the, the other two and they're great games.

45:39.900 --> 45:44.820
I mean, yeah, especially though I love all the Catwoman stuff in, um, Arkham, in Arkham

45:44.820 --> 45:45.820
city.

45:45.820 --> 45:46.820
That's great.

45:46.820 --> 45:47.820
Yeah.

45:47.820 --> 45:51.200
So, uh, and yeah, I need to play, I also have Arkham city on steam, so I'll play that at

45:51.200 --> 45:54.780
some point, but, uh, I want to get through Arkham asylum first, even though it might

45:54.780 --> 45:58.540
take me a little while and you got to tear me away from Final Fantasy 14 to do so.

45:58.540 --> 46:01.980
Um, and then I've just been slowly making progress in other games.

46:01.980 --> 46:05.600
Uh, new Mario, new Zelda, I haven't been playing those as much as I was when I first

46:05.600 --> 46:09.600
got them, but I don't, I mean, there's no games left to buy at this point.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.820
So the good news is, you know, through the holidays, I'll be able to make progress on

46:12.820 --> 46:14.020
some of these games I fell behind in.

46:14.020 --> 46:16.220
I think that's what a lot of you have planned.

46:16.220 --> 46:17.220
Eh?

46:17.220 --> 46:18.220
All right.

46:18.220 --> 46:19.220
Eh?

46:19.220 --> 46:20.220
Eh?

46:20.220 --> 46:21.220
Don't know.

46:21.220 --> 46:22.220
All right.

46:22.220 --> 46:23.220
Uh, housekeeping.

46:23.220 --> 46:27.220
Uh, you of course can friend the show at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and you can follow

46:27.220 --> 46:28.860
us on Twitter.

46:28.860 --> 46:29.860
Don't friend our butts.

46:30.740 --> 46:33.980
Twitter.com slash O L R. Some people aren't going to get that joke, dark saga.

46:33.980 --> 46:39.020
She's, she's referencing an old ass joke here on O L R. Um, what else is it going to say?

46:39.020 --> 46:41.140
Uh, we are on YouTube now as well.

46:41.140 --> 46:43.700
Uh, youtube.com slash orange launch radio.

46:43.700 --> 46:46.920
Thank you, Jason, very much for taking the time to put that all together.

46:46.920 --> 46:52.300
Don't bust your ass being a perfectionist on that because that's killed me so many times,

46:52.300 --> 46:57.700
but do it 99% and you're good.

46:57.700 --> 47:02.580
In my defense I did because I didn't, the, the, the video played essentially three and

47:02.580 --> 47:09.180
a half times and I know the second time was out of sync, but I'm going to fuck that up

47:09.180 --> 47:10.180
so bad.

47:10.180 --> 47:11.180
Jason.

47:11.180 --> 47:12.180
So don't get used to that.

47:12.180 --> 47:13.180
It'll happen.

47:13.180 --> 47:14.180
All right.

47:14.180 --> 47:16.700
Uh, but we're, we're dying for more youtube comments on what you guys would like to see

47:16.700 --> 47:18.940
over there outside of cameras in the studio.

47:18.940 --> 47:20.180
We know you all want that.

47:20.180 --> 47:21.180
We'll see.

47:21.180 --> 47:29.100
Um, let's see, uh, as far as the schedule for the show goes, I don't see us taking any

47:29.100 --> 47:30.420
shows off between now.

47:30.420 --> 47:33.680
I mean the way Christmas and new year's are this year, I think we're going to have shows

47:33.680 --> 47:38.300
right on through the new year, a schedule subject to change though.

47:38.300 --> 47:39.740
Loki will not be here next week though.

47:39.740 --> 47:42.140
Unfortunately, at least we don't think he's going to be.

47:42.140 --> 47:44.340
Loki would you like to tell listeners why you're not going to be here next week?

47:44.340 --> 47:48.580
I'm not going to be here next week cause on Thursday I have to get my wisdom teeth out.

47:48.580 --> 47:49.580
Good times.

47:50.260 --> 47:53.540
We are dying for Loki videos on, on the,

47:53.540 --> 47:54.540
I will try.

47:54.540 --> 47:55.820
I'm not going to have anything to do.

47:55.820 --> 47:57.840
So you know, I'm just going to be sitting at home.

47:57.840 --> 48:02.180
So Nellie, uh, she, she said she's gone through it.

48:02.180 --> 48:05.260
I think, Hey, I don't know if she's gone through it, but I think people have gone through it

48:05.260 --> 48:08.500
and they say, when you get out of general anesthesia, you're just very tired.

48:08.500 --> 48:09.500
So who knows?

48:09.500 --> 48:10.740
I may be sleeping.

48:10.740 --> 48:12.560
I was confused.

48:12.560 --> 48:15.420
I was talking about my ex boyfriend with my mother.

48:15.420 --> 48:17.900
Like I will never have anesthesia again after that.

48:17.900 --> 48:19.340
What was I thinking?

48:19.340 --> 48:20.340
I don't know.

48:20.340 --> 48:21.340
Well, let's see.

48:21.340 --> 48:22.900
We'll see what we talk, what I talk about.

48:22.900 --> 48:28.780
But um, I told her that I think she should record me like, you know, David after Dennis

48:28.780 --> 48:29.780
thing.

48:29.780 --> 48:30.780
Oh, we could just totally do that.

48:30.780 --> 48:32.260
I think you should play Grand Theft Auto while you're on the anesthesia.

48:32.260 --> 48:33.260
I probably will do.

48:33.260 --> 48:35.260
Oh, while I'm on the anesthesia.

48:35.260 --> 48:36.260
Yeah.

48:36.260 --> 48:38.860
That, that would be a hilarious view.

48:38.860 --> 48:41.140
Playing Grand Theft Auto while I'm on anesthesia.

48:41.140 --> 48:42.140
I'm asleep.

48:42.140 --> 48:43.140
Nothing's happening.

48:43.140 --> 48:49.100
I'm just going to let it play and just sit there for 15 minutes.

48:49.660 --> 48:50.660
No.

48:50.660 --> 48:55.020
Um, so yeah, I'm not looking forward to that cause I've never been put under and uh, never

48:55.020 --> 48:56.420
had an IV.

48:56.420 --> 48:58.940
All these firsts that I really don't want to have to do.

48:58.940 --> 49:03.220
Brad, uh, our buddy from pod culture here at the boys and geeks network says, wuss,

49:03.220 --> 49:04.220
get your butt to the show.

49:04.220 --> 49:05.220
Been there, done that.

49:05.220 --> 49:07.300
I had a hand sandwich two hours after mine were out.

49:07.300 --> 49:08.300
No, exactly.

49:08.300 --> 49:09.740
I, Hey, I'm totally with you.

49:09.740 --> 49:13.620
You know, I, I, I'm like ready to go back to work the next day, but you know, my wife's

49:13.620 --> 49:15.620
like, oh, wait, you're not gonna be able to eat anything.

49:15.620 --> 49:16.620
You're not really going to have to work.

49:16.660 --> 49:20.580
Dude, he said I could eat something right after, you know, my job becomes a numb because

49:20.580 --> 49:23.660
they don't want you to bite through your, you know, cheek or something like that.

49:23.660 --> 49:28.660
I just hope you don't run into the same thing that I did was that, well, the bottom holes

49:28.660 --> 49:33.100
didn't fill up for three months and I looked like I'd been in a prize fight for the entire

49:33.100 --> 49:34.100
time.

49:34.100 --> 49:35.100
Cool.

49:35.100 --> 49:36.100
Then I'm going to totally say I'm in a price fight.

49:36.100 --> 49:40.540
I also couldn't talk for the, those three months because I was talking to you cause

49:40.540 --> 49:42.540
you're moving me my jaw.

49:42.540 --> 49:45.580
You know, I got to say, I think SSG 100 Matt is absolutely right in the chat room and I

49:45.620 --> 49:49.260
believe his dad's a dentist if I remember right, he says wisdom teeth recovery is different

49:49.260 --> 49:50.260
for each person.

49:50.260 --> 49:53.500
I was able to eat fine a day or two after and yeah, I think it just depends on each

49:53.500 --> 49:54.500
person.

49:54.500 --> 49:55.500
Yeah.

49:55.500 --> 49:57.860
So don't, don't neglect the saline wash thing they tell you about.

49:57.860 --> 49:58.860
That's super important.

49:58.860 --> 50:01.540
Well, they're suturing them up, so I don't think it's going to be anything that I'm going

50:01.540 --> 50:04.100
to need to, I didn't have to do a saline wash either.

50:04.100 --> 50:06.860
I don't think I'm not going to be able to wash anything if it's sutured up.

50:06.860 --> 50:07.860
Okay.

50:07.860 --> 50:11.380
I seem to remember something about you have to do so that you don't want to get dry socket.

50:11.380 --> 50:12.380
No.

50:12.380 --> 50:16.540
So what I had to do was this, um, actually they gave me like a natural treatment to strengthen

50:16.540 --> 50:20.140
the gums and then I didn't have to do any type of rinses or anything afterwards, but

50:20.140 --> 50:21.140
I had my wisdom teeth out.

50:21.140 --> 50:23.180
I guess I went to the back alley, Dennis.

50:23.180 --> 50:26.900
Well, I had mine out though in the two thousands, you know?

50:26.900 --> 50:31.500
Well, you know, my wife's like, you know, you can't eat anything afterwards cause what

50:31.500 --> 50:32.980
if you get like something in there?

50:32.980 --> 50:34.260
I'm like, that's okay.

50:34.260 --> 50:35.260
If I eat meat.

50:35.260 --> 50:36.260
You can have a milkshake.

50:36.260 --> 50:37.780
If I, if I, well I'm going to have smoothies.

50:37.780 --> 50:42.020
If I can, uh, you know, if I can just eat meat, I'll just shove meat in there cause you know,

50:42.020 --> 50:43.020
flesh and flesh.

50:43.020 --> 50:44.020
It works.

50:44.020 --> 50:45.020
Have a meat milkshake.

50:45.020 --> 50:46.020
A meat shake.

50:46.020 --> 50:47.780
That's not as good as you think it is.

50:47.780 --> 50:50.260
Does your meat shake bring all the boys to the yard?

50:50.260 --> 50:52.660
Uh, does Jack in the box still do the bacon milkshake?

50:52.660 --> 50:53.660
You could do that.

50:53.660 --> 50:54.660
Oh God.

50:54.660 --> 50:55.660
That was just, that wasn't very good.

50:55.660 --> 50:56.660
That was pretty disgusting.

50:56.660 --> 50:57.660
It just seems like smokey vanilla.

50:57.660 --> 51:00.440
I agree with, I agree with Akuma JP, OLR, dentist edition.

51:00.440 --> 51:02.420
We're going way too far down the dentist line.

51:02.420 --> 51:06.020
Let's get into, uh, gaming news and what's going on in the video game world.

51:06.020 --> 51:08.060
Even though it is the holidays, things are slowing down a little bit.

51:08.060 --> 51:10.220
There's still some things to point out from the week.

51:10.220 --> 51:11.220
Quite a bit actually.

51:11.220 --> 51:12.220
Sorry, Scott.

51:12.220 --> 51:16.700
I'm trying, I'm actually going to be on laughing gas is going to be actually, uh, I'm pretty

51:16.700 --> 51:18.820
sure it's an Ivy.

51:18.820 --> 51:20.220
That's too bad cause I think it would be hilarious.

51:20.220 --> 51:21.780
I was on both.

51:21.780 --> 51:26.740
I don't think they're going to put me on both cause they did give me a, was it a, they needed

51:26.740 --> 51:28.380
both to knock out your soul.

51:28.380 --> 51:29.380
Dark soccer.

51:29.380 --> 51:36.100
The whole, the whole reason, you know what, this is true, but the whole, the whole reason

51:36.100 --> 51:39.180
is because, um, it actually dilates your blood vessels.

51:39.180 --> 51:41.900
They gave me something, they couldn't get the IV in.

51:41.900 --> 51:45.100
They gave me something to take the edge off before I go there.

51:45.100 --> 51:46.100
I don't remember what it is.

51:46.100 --> 51:52.180
So some sort of drug that could you take the edge off the show by doing some gaming news?

51:52.180 --> 51:55.140
So Sony has reset some PlayStation network passwords.

51:55.140 --> 52:01.460
Um, they said that there was some irregular activity and apparently, you know, they, they

52:01.460 --> 52:06.460
came out, try not to, you know, alarm anyone, you know, re routinely monitor for a regular

52:06.460 --> 52:11.860
activity and if such activity is detected, we may sometimes reset passwords of affected

52:11.860 --> 52:16.660
SCN accounts to protect consumers and their account information.

52:16.660 --> 52:22.260
The password resets are not related to an attack nor vulnerability in our data servers.

52:22.260 --> 52:26.660
It is an example of an increasingly common threat of malicious online activity.

52:26.660 --> 52:31.660
Although I'd like to follow that up with, didn't I just read not too long ago that there

52:31.660 --> 52:36.540
was some people being affected by the same type of shit that we saw with, you know, the

52:36.540 --> 52:41.900
FIFA hacking now on the PlayStation 4 and maybe it's something to do with that.

52:41.900 --> 52:45.460
But maybe I'm also, you know, being too conspiracy furious.

52:45.460 --> 52:52.180
No, and I have some serious concerns about this story because when I turned on my PlayStation

52:52.180 --> 52:55.460
3 earlier this week, it made me reset my password.

52:55.460 --> 52:57.180
So I'm one of the people that had to do it.

52:57.180 --> 53:00.380
And so there was a part of me that's like, why?

53:00.380 --> 53:02.180
Why am I being picked?

53:02.180 --> 53:05.740
Because there shouldn't be any irregularities on my account.

53:05.740 --> 53:10.300
I only use my PlayStation 3 and the Vita once in a great while.

53:10.300 --> 53:12.060
Why am I having to reset my password?

53:12.060 --> 53:16.260
Which is, you know, it's kind of, I mean, changing your password is good and so forth,

53:16.260 --> 53:19.020
but it's like, okay, now I really have to have unique passwords.

53:19.020 --> 53:21.980
If it's in a constellation, they only hacked celebrities.

53:21.980 --> 53:22.980
Okay.

53:22.980 --> 53:23.980
Yeah.

53:23.980 --> 53:25.820
But that's my problem is that I'm like, wait a minute.

53:25.820 --> 53:30.660
Does that mean I was one of those people that they saw vulnerability for from the two

53:30.660 --> 53:32.020
million other hack thing?

53:32.020 --> 53:33.460
And I'm like, son of a bitch.

53:33.460 --> 53:34.460
Like, am I at risk?

53:34.460 --> 53:36.980
Like, it has me a little concerned.

53:36.980 --> 53:44.460
So this is actually on the heels of a similar tech story about three or four weeks ago.

53:44.460 --> 53:48.780
The chief one was the start of September with the big Adobe hack.

53:48.780 --> 53:54.980
There were between that and then there are other miscellaneous news about, not that Twitter

53:54.980 --> 54:01.060
and Facebook were hacked, but I saw something from them earlier this week.

54:01.060 --> 54:07.180
LinkedIn and Adobe's password theft were like the big ones a couple months ago.

54:07.180 --> 54:11.980
And this trend that's emerged from these really prominent companies is that they will get

54:11.980 --> 54:13.900
that exported data.

54:13.900 --> 54:20.100
And if your password, if your email address shows up, they'll warn you if your password

54:20.100 --> 54:24.500
matches the same password hash, because any company in their right mind does not store

54:25.020 --> 54:26.020
plain text passwords.

54:26.020 --> 54:27.020
Unfortunately, some do.

54:27.020 --> 54:28.020
These don't.

54:28.020 --> 54:33.340
If your password matches a leaked hash, they reset your password because they force you

54:33.340 --> 54:34.340
to.

54:34.340 --> 54:39.180
You might've hit the nail on the head because I, I use unique passwords everywhere.

54:39.180 --> 54:40.740
But you probably use the same email address.

54:40.740 --> 54:43.660
But I use the same email address as PlayStation network.

54:43.660 --> 54:46.460
I had an Adobe account on there.

54:46.460 --> 54:47.800
That could be it.

54:47.800 --> 54:48.800
You might be right.

54:48.800 --> 54:53.620
And I feel a little better knowing that even, even with, even with hash passwords that I

54:53.620 --> 54:57.340
could, to the extent that I actually have this knowledge, I could delve into the quick,

54:57.340 --> 55:00.020
the quick overview is that remember, I'm a corporate trainer.

55:00.020 --> 55:01.020
There's Adobe.

55:01.020 --> 55:02.020
There's an Adobe stuff.

55:02.020 --> 55:03.020
Here's the thing.

55:03.020 --> 55:06.900
Then why didn't they just say, Hey, we saw that, you know, Adobe has been hacked near

55:06.900 --> 55:08.140
these people have been hacked.

55:08.140 --> 55:12.620
We ran a list, you know, comparing, you know, the emails that were affected, um, from those

55:12.620 --> 55:13.620
sites.

55:13.620 --> 55:15.900
And as a precautionary measure, we went ahead and reset the passwords.

55:15.900 --> 55:17.700
I think of it a little bit more explanation.

55:17.700 --> 55:22.340
If that's the case, that would, it would actually be better in their favor because they would

55:22.340 --> 55:24.860
be, Oh, they're very proactive about that.

55:24.860 --> 55:27.940
Code man in chat says I had to reset my PSN password too.

55:27.940 --> 55:29.960
I bet code man's an Adobe user.

55:29.960 --> 55:30.960
He does all that.

55:30.960 --> 55:33.720
I know he does stuff with video and graphic design.

55:33.720 --> 55:34.720
That's weird.

55:34.720 --> 55:36.780
I'm an Adobe user too, but I didn't have to reset my password.

55:36.780 --> 55:39.900
Oh, that's because I don't, well, I never got it.

55:39.900 --> 55:41.820
Did you use different emails though?

55:41.820 --> 55:44.700
I don't know if I give them, did you subscribe to their live services?

55:44.700 --> 55:45.700
You probably didn't.

55:45.700 --> 55:46.700
Yeah.

55:46.700 --> 55:48.580
See, that's, I never got anything to reset my Adobe passwords though.

55:48.580 --> 55:53.300
Did you ever use like, um, I, the name escapes me all of a sudden of the screencast or whatever

55:53.300 --> 55:59.220
it is that they use or just any of their online services, acrobat online or I've got the creative

55:59.220 --> 56:04.900
cloud because we was given the account for creative cloud for a year.

56:04.900 --> 56:07.540
See Allen chat room says tinfoil hat radio.

56:07.540 --> 56:09.420
I'm looking for a trend.

56:09.420 --> 56:10.420
Okay.

56:10.420 --> 56:13.180
Shane Alinko says I don't use Adobe, but I had to reset mine.

56:13.180 --> 56:14.180
All right.

56:14.180 --> 56:15.180
So y'all just blew a hole in my theory.

56:15.180 --> 56:16.180
Do you use LinkedIn?

56:16.180 --> 56:17.180
Oh yeah.

56:17.180 --> 56:18.180
Oh yeah.

56:18.780 --> 56:20.420
Maybe, maybe he did though.

56:20.420 --> 56:21.420
Hmm.

56:21.420 --> 56:22.420
No.

56:22.420 --> 56:24.180
If Shane uses LinkedIn, then he's not on my profile.

56:24.180 --> 56:28.140
I usually know why he's not my friend on LinkedIn with my work email.

56:28.140 --> 56:34.340
So I don't ever, there's, there are many different sources of these things happening.

56:34.340 --> 56:40.100
And even when the, the, the, the extracted information and breach is released, sometimes

56:40.100 --> 56:47.420
it's not all of the information again, if, if, if they just go off password hashes, which

56:47.420 --> 56:52.740
are not necessarily a perfect way of doing things, but if data doesn't match, your record

56:52.740 --> 56:53.740
doesn't show up.

56:53.740 --> 56:54.740
You don't have to change it.

56:54.740 --> 56:56.260
There is no one answer for everything.

56:56.260 --> 57:01.060
This is the continuing saga of security exploits vulnerabilities.

57:01.060 --> 57:02.060
It happens.

57:02.060 --> 57:03.640
It continues on whatever it happened.

57:03.640 --> 57:07.060
As long as you take your precautions to stay safe, we don't have a problem here.

57:07.060 --> 57:11.820
Use distinct passwords, enable two factor authentication if the service supports it,

57:11.820 --> 57:12.820
be safe out there.

57:12.820 --> 57:14.380
It sucks sometimes.

57:14.380 --> 57:15.380
And then it's awesome.

57:15.380 --> 57:16.380
Like this show.

57:16.380 --> 57:17.380
Uh, yeah.

57:17.380 --> 57:18.380
That's okay.

57:18.380 --> 57:20.580
We're talking about drugs and chat.

57:20.580 --> 57:25.700
Uh, also I don't, I don't want to, I want to really kind of just make sure I poke something

57:25.700 --> 57:26.900
with a sharp stick here.

57:26.900 --> 57:30.580
What Loki said about the whole FIFA hacks happening again on Sony, I just want to make

57:30.580 --> 57:35.300
sure I call that out because that's a great concern to me.

57:35.300 --> 57:39.420
And now I seem to remember when this, now my memory could be going here.

57:39.420 --> 57:45.380
I seem to remember EA through this on Microsoft big time when that happened, EA pushback and

57:45.380 --> 57:49.180
in land of Microsoft and I was one of those people that got hacked on Microsoft and so

57:49.180 --> 57:50.180
forth.

57:50.180 --> 57:51.180
And I said, you know what?

57:51.180 --> 57:52.460
No, there's a connection here.

57:52.460 --> 57:56.100
They created an EA account for me to buy all these.

57:56.100 --> 58:01.140
There's something going on on EA side that they're not fessing up to.

58:01.140 --> 58:06.020
And if this is, if this happened again, now it's through Sony.

58:06.020 --> 58:09.460
I think EA, you got some explaining to do.

58:09.460 --> 58:13.340
Didn't we, this, my, my brain could just be linking this in a strange way, but didn't

58:13.340 --> 58:18.900
we basically narrow it down to, uh, that kind of stuff happening because of Amazon's

58:18.900 --> 58:25.820
lax customer support, like, like Amazon, reverse social engineering on Microsoft, not Amazon,

58:25.820 --> 58:30.380
and like using, using other profile details, uh, other credit card information or an email

58:30.380 --> 58:31.380
address destination.

58:31.380 --> 58:34.580
They're like, my, my brain has like seven companies in mind.

58:34.580 --> 58:37.980
It's trying to remember the loop of the details and it's been a long time.

58:37.980 --> 58:39.700
I think it's an explanation.

58:39.700 --> 58:43.240
I'm not totally convinced it's the right one, especially now that we have this other thing

58:43.240 --> 58:44.240
going on here.

58:44.240 --> 58:50.960
And I kind of need EA to be very clear here on why it's not them and some, some very specific

58:50.960 --> 58:53.800
about what they're doing with data and how they're keeping it safe.

58:53.800 --> 58:57.440
I'm just saying that as a consumer, I mean, you might be a tech person sitting there going,

58:57.440 --> 59:01.480
Rob, there's no way that I just, as a consumer right now, I don't trust that this isn't happening

59:01.480 --> 59:04.200
because of something on EA side.

59:04.200 --> 59:09.640
I mean, it's, it's just too weird of a coincidence that it happened on Microsoft through an EA

59:09.640 --> 59:14.200
game and now it's happening through Sony on an EA game.

59:14.200 --> 59:18.960
That's that Scott of Tron and chat says, yeah, like EA would fess up to anything.

59:18.960 --> 59:24.160
Well, then we'll have to see how much we want to support them and give them information

59:24.160 --> 59:26.360
and money further on.

59:26.360 --> 59:31.320
But anyhow, here's something, uh, that I'm sure a lot of you will be spending money on.

59:31.320 --> 59:35.920
It was something that was announced during the, uh, VGX, uh, award show.

59:35.920 --> 59:40.040
One of the, one of the few highlights out of the show, uh, telltale announced that they

59:40.040 --> 59:44.020
are working on a game tales from the borderlands.

59:44.020 --> 59:49.040
So of course telltale did the, the speaking of video game award shows, they, they won

59:49.040 --> 59:51.240
them all for walking dead last year.

59:51.240 --> 59:53.080
Now tons of people want to work with them.

59:53.080 --> 59:56.840
So gearbox software, one of the people is working with telltale on this.

59:56.840 --> 59:58.680
So it's a game in the borderlands universe.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.440
It will be an episodic series.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.760
The storyline is defined by player choices.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:08.200
Um, gearbox will be providing borderlands assets telltale, however, is the ones that

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.720
are, uh, designing the game.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.320
Telltale did make new characters for this game.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:19.320
They are saying they are not quite vault hunters, uh, and some of the characters seen in it,

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:24.400
possibly handsome Jack, uh, although it's more of a resemblance in the trailer, part

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.200
of me kind of wonders, could it be like a prequel or something?

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.360
I think it's supposed to be during the same time as borderlands two or before.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.360
So we'll see.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.400
Uh, that wasn't the only thing telltale had to announce.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.280
They, uh, announced quite a bit because they also announced that they're working on a game

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.760
of thrones game.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:46.440
Uh, so yeah, and I think isn't, do we already have some, they already kind of, that came

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:51.240
out I think last week or earlier this week, but they did say it's based on the HBO series,

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.240
not the books.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.240
Um, cool.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.280
So that's, you know, cause I think they've kind of gone different directions at this

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.280
point.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.200
So it will be based off the HBO series and it is now official.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.680
So, uh, there you go.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.400
So a telltale clearly very busy.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.340
Uh, one thing I noticed that there wasn't a lot that people have been talking about

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.340
this year.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:12.560
Telltale kind of didn't have a lot this year, although chat pointed out to me before the

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:17.440
show, um, the, the wolves among us or something was a game that came out this year, but that

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.660
didn't, that didn't get quite the chatter that some of their other releases have.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:27.320
So, um, you know, I'm wondering if there will be more in 2014, although I think walking

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.360
dead episode or season two is supposed to be like really soon.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.000
Uh, some are saying it might be later this month, although it seems like a really weird

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.360
time to release next year, probably early next year, but you never know.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.740
I mean, you know, telltale could recognize that they do a bulk of their business through

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:46.080
digital distribution and they could release whenever.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.480
And you know, what a great thing to pick up on these gaming consoles right away.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.480
Who knows?

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480
Who knows?

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.480
So, all right.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.120
Uh, moving on dark soccer.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:00.200
Well, you know, we've had a lot of, uh, joy over a particular gaming franchise and that's

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.200
Tomb Raider.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.080
Well, the definitive edition is coming out for PS4 and Xbone.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.560
I mean, Xbox one.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:14.940
Um, it's supposed to be out on January 28th in the US and in Europe on January 31st.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.680
And it was announced on the games Tumblr.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.560
I'm glad to see Tumblr getting more love.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:26.120
So you get all of the pre-order, um, bonuses, the, the Tomb of the Lost Adventurer and the

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:32.040
multiplayer add-ons, uh, eight DLC maps, uh, six weapons and four characters.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:37.840
You also get extra Lara outfits and, um, digital copies of the, uh, Tomb Raider, the beginning

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.200
and the art, the art book.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.760
So lots of stuff.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.880
Also the final hours of Tomb Raider will be included as well.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.080
The Xbox one version will have, uh, connect voice controls for weapon modding and menus.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.240
Um, and that's, I don't care.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.480
So there's, there's a part of me that wants to razz this a little bit because it's like,

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.840
so we're, so we're remaking a game that just came out last year.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.400
But then I think, all right, well, but at the same time, at least they gave you everything

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.080
and didn't just move the game and have you rebuy everything.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.080
Yeah.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.760
Well, and the other thing is too that the, you know, it's not uncommon for big games

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.960
to get a like game of the year edition that includes everything.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:21.280
That's kind of what this is, but yet they, they, they turned it up for these new consoles,

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.680
which I find, it's just interesting.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.840
We haven't, I haven't really seen something like this that I can think of before, you

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.280
know, outside maybe Nintendo remaking some of the Wii games.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.120
That's, that's just not even the same thing.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:37.520
You know, I like the sentence in the article on PS4, your controller will light up when

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.640
using the torch.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.640
It's cute.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.280
I'm assuming they'll also use the backlight, the eye light as well.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.840
But the controller is already lit up all the time.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.960
So am I using the torch all the time?

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.960
Perhaps.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.120
It's gonna change colors.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.360
The big thing about that for me personally though, is that given that I've played it

01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:05.200
on PC and just all of the just graphical glory that it produced, as well as being solid gameplay

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.680
wise, I think it would be a nice treat for people at home to be able to play it up to

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.720
that level too.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720
Yeah.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.960
And I gotta be honest, as much as I'm saying like, you know, Oh, this is interesting.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.440
You know, I, I do still kind of want to, I actually really want to get it because I thought

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.800
the game was gorgeous as it was on, you know, even 360 and now they're talking about, Oh,

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.440
we're going to turn it, turn up the graphics even more.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.880
I'm kind of like, Ooh, I kind of want to check that out for me price.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.960
Do I want to drop $60 on it again?

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.480
You want to check it out with better graphics played on PC.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.720
But to, to be fair, they, I mean, it's, it's different to be like better graphics from

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:51.760
what they've got or they are going back and actually upping some of the assets and so

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.760
far.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.920
I mean, they're, they're, this isn't just repackaging it.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.920
I think it's playing it on the new console.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.000
I think it's just putting the PC assets on your, more of the PC assets on the console.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.920
I don't think they're going back and redoing anything.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.960
That's not the, eh, that's not the impression I was getting.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.400
Look, yeah, I think there's more to it than that because especially cause they talk about

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.400
like this stuff.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400
I know this.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.400
All right.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.400
Well I guess we'll find out in a month and a half.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.640
But the stuff with the hair sounds very different.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.440
So like that takes, you know, and they, they con they got these other studios to get involved

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.440
too.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.440
Is that takes work.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.440
There's stuff with her hair.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.440
Yeah.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:24.440
They, they changed something.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.160
Their hair is more fluid, hairy.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.160
It's more hair-like.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.160
Really?

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.360
Cause I believe that was one of the PC things, if I remember correctly.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:40.000
I do have to say that there was a difference in, as far as when I first loaded up the game

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.080
with the lower end and then bumped it up all the way, there were a little bit few differences

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:50.360
with hair mechanics, hair mechanics, remember the special thing, hair mechanics.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.360
Yes.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:57.640
I would believe that would be the Tomb Raider Tress FX hair, uh, which is an option on PC.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:02.120
That's the enhanced hair, um, both, you know, the physics and stuff.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:06.280
So that, yes, would be a PC thing.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.920
So basically they're taking the PC assets and putting them on next gen, but hey, whatever,

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:10.920
that's fine.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.120
You know what hair physics always make me think of?

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:20.480
Uh, Soul Edge and all, and the, the Tekken games when they started doing, you can see

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:27.080
that the strands of hair, I was like, but it doesn't look like real hair.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.080
I have to say that Lara's hair looked like hair.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.200
It was very hairy.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.960
Well, I just thought, I just thought the game in general looked great.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.580
So, you know, it already was starting to look, you know, like, I don't want to say it looked

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:43.200
like next gen, but it just, it looks like such a, it's a, it's a great example of what

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.280
the previous gen consoles were really capable of.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:51.640
So I'm, I'm fairly certain cause you know, Dan's been seeing me play the game.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.240
I've gone back and played it, you know, tried to get a little bit further cause I haven't

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.640
beaten it yet, but I did play it fairly consistently and I would love to see Dan play through that.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.680
But I know he'd enjoy it.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.200
Yeah, I'm sure, and you know, I'm sure there are some people that miss the boat the first

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.200
time around too.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:10.320
I see in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Shane says, Shane Alinko says, this is good

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.400
for me as I didn't play the original release.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.200
I'll definitely look into getting this.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.320
So, but then there's a part of me that's like, how did you miss the original release when

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:23.360
the game was like on sale for a steal on some of the very steam sales and so forth?

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:30.400
I used my, uh, my steam wallet gift and got it, like I paid three bucks extra for it.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.400
So there you go.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.400
All right.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.680
Uh, let's move on.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.680
More news.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.680
Loki.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.680
All right.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:43.800
Um, let's see, let's talk a little bit about, uh, the Xbox one.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.880
Um, remember one of the things that they kind of talked about, I think it was a few months

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:55.000
ago, this whole, you know, being able to publish using your Xbox one as like a dev kit.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.560
And actually some people figured out how to do that or at least get into the dev kit mode

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.840
and I've been dicking around with that.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.840
But, um, for the actual devs, um, they've already, um, listed 33 developers that are

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:14.080
participating in their ID at, um, Xbox, uh, program, I guess if you want to call it, um,

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:21.240
including, uh, behavior, which, uh, I guess they did, uh, wet and naughty bear panic in

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.240
paradise.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.240
What was a good game?

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.240
Naughty bear.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:32.400
Not so much bong fish, uh, born ready, uh, Cappy, which is super time force, uh, concept

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:40.520
cry tech, uh, definition six, which did spy party, um, demerge the shoot many robots,

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:46.680
uh, double 11, little big planet Vita, double fine, uh, drink box, gaijin games, the bit

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:54.680
trip series, uh, half brick studios, fruit ninja, happy in labs, uh, hidden path, high

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.080
voltage software, which did the conduit, which man, they haven't released anything in a long

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.080
time.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:06.560
Um, anise, you may remember them, elite beat agents, anyone, uh, iron galaxy, jackbox games,

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.760
um, Nicholas, which the cave story and VVVVVV.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.640
I didn't know that same guy did both those games.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.640
Pretty sweet.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:21.760
Um, ninja B, other ocean, which, uh, the, uh, dark void zero and super monkey ball games

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:29.480
on iOS, uh, panic button, which unfortunately connects star Wars signal studios, uh, slightly

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:35.280
mad studios, team 17 behind the worm series, uh, team colorblind, uh, the men who wear

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:42.440
many hats, best name of development house ever, uh, the odd gentlemen, Vladimir, uh,

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.760
way forward, uh, Z boy games and Zen studios.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:53.800
If I remember correctly, Nicholas, uh, did the 3d, it's either that they published VVVVVV

01:09:53.800 --> 01:10:00.720
or that they brought it to DS or some other platform because that was Terry Cavanaugh.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.800
And I'm maybe, yeah, maybe they published, they might've done the ports then.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:08.160
Cause I know like these guys are doing ports of things and cave story did come out on multiple

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.160
platforms as well.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160
It's true.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:16.120
Um, the other thing that can kind of go along with that though is, uh, some of the, um,

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:24.800
indie publishers are running into, uh, I guess some of their small print things in this part

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.800
of this program.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:31.040
Uh, for example, not only do you get, you know, I guess the wonderful, like, um, you

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.440
get two console development kits, a unity license, and the ability to publish your games

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.440
by yourself.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.840
Um, also they asked that, um, the games that launched same day on X-Box one and any other

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:49.280
console platforms, um, they say, um, they want launch parody rather than exclusivity.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:56.520
And um, I guess one of these, so it, one of the developers that ran into this, um, was

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.280
it, uh, Vladimir, I, yeah, Vlambeer.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:05.520
Um, they're saying that they, one of their games, a nuclear throne, I guess was supposed

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.680
to, they were talking with them about bringing it to the X-Box one.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:19.160
And um, I guess they maybe wanted it to be exclusive, but somehow because of that, they're

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.600
actually going to publish it on PlayStation four.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:29.040
Um, you know, they said, I guess, uh, it'll just come out on PlayStation four first, I

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.660
guess they're, they didn't have an X-Box one version available, but they wanted to

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:37.880
publish it on that platform later on.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:44.280
Um, but because Microsoft basically restricting you, you must launch your game on the X-Box

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.560
one and then all the other platforms at the same time.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.560
Oh, I see.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.720
So, you know, they didn't want to hold up the other versions of the game for the, could

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.400
that be because of what happened with DuckTales?

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.320
Cause you know, DuckTales didn't come out on X-Box till way after the other versions.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.560
And I think, I don't think it's that.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.240
I think they just want to have, they don't want to be at a disadvantage as far as like

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.880
exclusive versions or something like that.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:09.400
I maybe, maybe that's fine, but maybe they just don't want Sony to have like a window

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.120
on that stuff.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.280
Microsoft wants to have the window, you know, on call of duty DLC and all that bullshit.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.280
Sure.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.360
Um, so maybe that's what the issue is.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.880
I think though, maybe they can get around it by doing, you know, pulling them kind of

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:28.040
what Microsoft did with, you know, Minecraft, you know, have the Minecraft X-Box one version

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.360
and then Minecraft PlayStation four version.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.840
Technically they're two different games, you know, and then they'd be able to publish it

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.840
later on or something.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.200
Uh, Black Wolf says, he wants to try to explain this here.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.620
The X-Box one wants parody, the loophole.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:43.500
If you are already signed up for another platform, they don't have to wait.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:48.400
So they said, quote, Oh, they want parody if I sign, Hey Sony, one a one month exclusive

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.400
quote.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.400
Sure.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400
Uh, okay.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.400
Hey, Hey Microsoft.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.400
We want to sign up.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400
Oh, okay.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400
That's fine.

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.540
So interesting.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:05.040
This is a, this is a great policy in theory for, you know, gamers consumers most of all,

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.840
because it means that no matter what platform you've backed, if your game is coming multi-console,

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:14.400
you will get it and you don't have to spoilers or any other consideration that you don't,

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.600
you don't have to wait on anybody else.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:21.360
But if maybe in theory, because, you know, Bobby just pointed out, there's a way around

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360
it.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360
Yeah.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.640
As far as games that actually get released on multiple platforms at the same time, if

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:34.560
you do not budget your time, and this article basically talks that, um, that the development

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.720
shop, uh, that Vlambeer was caught off guard, but if you do not budget your time properly

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:46.400
or you just come across this, if you are bound to this, it's going to hurt your firm and

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.600
potentially your results and potentially the game because you weren't expecting to have

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:57.280
to put almost almost entirely, literally two times the work in for one release date.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:02.400
I love this concept, but like anything else, it has a trade off that unfortunately gets

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.820
to be pretty nasty pretty quick.

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:09.600
If I were them, you know, I would just want the least amount of restrictions possible

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:16.680
for the developers because right now the perception is PlayStation four is very developer friendly

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.680
Xbox one.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.360
I don't think they've quite gotten there yet where people are kind of recognized as a platform

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.080
that they can find their favorite indie games.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.600
I would think they want the least amount of obstacles in between them and getting that

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.480
at least at the beginning, you know, hell, change your rules later on down the line if

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:39.280
you know, once you have a decent catalog of indie games, but, and I'm also kind of disappointed

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.440
that they kind of got rid of the whole, you know, it's kind of a twofold thing.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:49.440
I'm kind of disappointed that they got rid of the whole community games and knew the

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.800
idea of, Oh, I can use my Xbox one to publish my own games and stuff.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.800
That's really cool.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.520
But I understand, you know, that there were a lot of crappy games on that, that service

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.040
at the same time though, it still would be nice to have that ability to put your own

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.040
games on there.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.600
Maybe it was some sort of peer review or something like that to filter out, you know, those massage

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.600
simulators.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.960
Let's clear out the chaff.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960
Yeah.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:16.320
To register participation for this week's episode of orange laundry radio at vog network.com

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.800
use the passphrase sailboat.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.920
Well let's move on with more information about the Xbox one, cause there's a really weird

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.120
rumor going on out there and it's just, it's one of those things I think it's kind of trolling

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:31.660
people who can't or who don't understand technology or I don't know, because there's this weird

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.240
picture going around out there and I'm not going to repeat the description here cause

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.360
I don't want to perpetuate a rumor that could potentially damage people's consoles, but

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.720
it's the equivalent of basically telling people, Hey, if you put up, up, down, down, left,

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:49.320
right, left, right, BA star into your Xbox one, you will be able to play Xbox 360 games.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:54.160
And there's people, and I don't want to say that they're dumb enough to believe it, but

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:58.940
they're not educated enough on how these systems really work that they actually kind of believe

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:02.240
it because they use the magic words that, Oh, you're going to, you're going to get into

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:08.660
dev console mode on your Xbox one and it'll unlock the ability to play Xbox 360 games.

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:15.360
So let's review. The reason why Xbox 360 games are not playable on the Xbox one is

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:20.620
because the chips inside have changed completely. They are different manufacturers now. Correct

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:25.860
Loki? Yeah, it's different architecture altogether. And actually you see that surprise and it

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:32.020
came from 4chan. Um, and basically it's someone stumbled upon the way to get into developer

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:35.820
mode and Microsoft said, Hey, don't try to get into developer mode cause it will break

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:41.520
your console because it's two parts. Microsoft that's basically, you know, give you the access

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.140
to this and then you also have to enable it on your console in order to actually switch

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:51.120
it over to kind of like developer mode. If you don't do it without their access, it causes

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.100
all sorts of different problems with it. So if you, if you follow the rules, what you're

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:59.020
doing, you're not, you're not unlocking anything. You're causing your Xbox one to basically

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:05.060
do like an infinite loop booting. So it's just, it's just some troll thing from 4chan.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:10.020
So, you know, just to be clear, don't get, don't, if you read something that's too good

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:14.660
to be true, it probably is. This is the second time in three months, something like this

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:19.140
has happened. Oh, what was the other one? The first one? IOS seven makes your device

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:25.260
waterproof. Wait, that was a thing? That was a thing? I kid you. I didn't even hear that.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:30.660
If you go to Twitter search and you type in IOS waterproof, the top tweet minus the fucking

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:36.580
LG ad, whatever. Uh, if you go that, if you do that in a, in Twitter search, I actually

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:40.420
did this just to kind of make sure I wasn't crazy. And sure enough, the very first tweet

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:45.060
in the search results 4chan convinced people that IOS seven makes their iPhones waterproof.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:50.540
Now they've convinced people to break their Xbox ones with backwards compatibility. Uh,

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:55.060
IOS seven came out, uh, uh, mid September, early September, three months later. Look

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.480
at this all over again. I think it's, you know, just a lesson that if something is too

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:04.960
good to be true, it is very, I don't know. It's just interesting to me that, you know,

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.100
there's always, there's always been smoke and mirrors and uh, there's a better, there's

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:12.960
a better terminology for this. Uh, there's always been snake oil salesman, but this is

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.840
like, this is the, these are the internet snake oil sales common sense. But if they

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.680
had the ability to play backwards, they're have full backwards compatibility. They would

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:25.980
be totally pimping that shit out if not trying to sell it, you know, as a DLC or something.

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:29.060
But they would be pimping that show. Hey, we have backwards compatibility. Those guys

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:35.500
don't. I mean, why would you lock that away? Yeah, it's a silly anyway. All right. Uh,

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:41.620
let's move on to less silly things. How about something that's a lot kinder? Um, well, uh,

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:45.660
there's actually an article talking about the humble bundle and one of the charities

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:49.220
that they've helped out. They've actually been, um, working to bring clean drinking

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:55.580
water to Ethiopia, which I think is definitely something positive that we need to be focusing

01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:02.380
on instead of people being assholes. Um, so basically, um, they worked with a particular

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:07.940
charity that used a hundred percent of the donations to bring clean water. And so now

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:17.220
they have, uh, 3,275 people in Ethiopia that are going to have a clean water. And the total

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:25.460
amount was, uh, it came up to $121,780. So that's pretty good news. See, we're not all

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:29.380
assholes. I like to hear the gamers doing good stories and it plus it's kind of nice

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:33.340
to see too. We always kind of like, I think a lot of us when we're buying these humble

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:36.900
bundles and so forth, we just kind of click the button and it's like, Oh yay, some of

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:41.900
my money's going to good pat myself on the back. We don't really see it past that. So

01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.940
I'm glad there's information out there like this to really kind of show like here is how

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:49.740
the money is really helping. You know what I mean? And I think it's good that they're

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:56.300
being so transparent with how that money is being allocated to and giving us the option.

01:19:56.300 --> 01:20:00.740
And you know, it's, it's sort of like, Hey, you know, you do something good for somebody

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:05.900
else. We'll do something good for you here. Have some fun. You know, I've always been

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:10.220
a big advocate of the charities like that, especially, uh, you know, even though I'm

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:15.100
not too fond of Penny Arcade themselves, I've been happy with Child's Play and with a lot

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:21.780
of those, um, charities that basically turns our love of games into almost love for other

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:27.300
people. Right. You know. All right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.140
release dates. And I know this might be a short segment tonight, but we check in every

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:35.300
week on what games are coming out in a video game store near you, starting with the U S

01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:39.060
Loki. Uh, the only thing coming out this week is Sorcery Saga Curse of the Great Curry

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:45.940
God on PlayStation Vita. Um, actually, if I remember correctly, there's Dreamfall, uh,

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:50.820
ventures or chronic, I think it's Dreamfall adventures. That's coming out on Xbox three

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:54.460
six. It's been delayed forever. Maybe it's being delayed again, but, uh, that was supposed

01:20:54.460 --> 01:21:00.820
to be coming out. And then guess what? That's it for the entire year. I figured as much.

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:05.980
All right. Well in Japan, uh, things are moving a little bit differently because, uh, obviously

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:09.920
the holidays are a little bit different over there. So, you know, uh, you can pre-order

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:13.700
one of these games to go with your Christmas cake if you like. Uh, but on the PlayStation

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:18.820
three this week on December 12th in Japan, um, some game of the year additions, dishonored,

01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:23.860
uh, crisis three going into best hits, uh, call of duty ghost gets a dubbed version,

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:28.700
uh, released this week. As far as new games go, there's a new PlayStation three console

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:33.580
bundle with puppeteer. That's out this week. And, uh, Jinsei ego to next generation and

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:39.620
Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou comes out this week from Koei. So that's what you can look forward

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:44.780
to this week on December 12th, as far as PlayStation three goes, let me check out three 60. Um,

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:48.860
the same call of duty ghost dubbed version is out there as well as dishonored the game

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:54.340
of the year edition. That's pretty much it for the three 60, um, going to the PlayStation

01:21:54.340 --> 01:22:01.020
Vita Hatsune Miku project diva gets a price reduction. Uh, Vita's region free, right?

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:05.140
This might be your time to pick it up. So you folks here in the U S if you want your

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:09.980
a version of Hatsune Miku for the Vita, this might be a good time to pick it up. Uh, on

01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:15.900
the Wii U, uh, the balance board USB adapter comes out this week, uh, which I imagine is

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:20.140
for Wii fit you, but I don't know exactly what that the balance board USB adapter, are

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.740
they going to let you start plugging that into computers and stuff? I didn't even know

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:27.260
that was a thing. Um, well, you know what? It's not coming out from Nintendo. It's a

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:31.940
third party, so it must be some type of battery pack. I'm guessing. Oh yeah. Maybe it's some

01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:36.100
weird kind of thing. All right. Well that's there, but you can also get monster hunter

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:41.380
front frontier G and a beginner's package that's out from Capcom this week on the Wii

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:48.500
U. Uh, lastly, but not leastly on the Nintendo 3DS, uh, hometown story, Kira, Maki, waku

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:55.260
waku suite, uh, Kobito, Zukin, Kobito, no Fushigi, G, can set comes out this week, puzzle

01:22:55.300 --> 01:23:05.100
and dragons Z. Is that the same as the cell phone game? I bet it is. Yeah. Yeah, I think

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:09.820
it is. Yeah. Same as the cell phone game is getting like a, uh, spruced up 3DS version

01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:15.540
in Japan this week. Um, also, uh, and probably most importantly this week in Japan on the

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:24.180
Nintendo 3DS, hello kitty to Maho no apron rhythm cooking comes out this week. That's

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:29.700
right. You can cook. It's, it's cooking mama meets a rhythm game meets hello kitty. I should

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:34.300
not go back to the name real quick. I shit you not. I want this game kind of bad. Actually.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:40.580
Go back to the name real quick. There you go. I'm not there. Uh, come on. Close right

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:46.940
there. Hello kitty with the magic apron. It's a rhythm cooking game starring hello kitty

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:53.020
and a magic apron. Why can't I have this? I want this. Give it to me. You're not worthy.

01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:59.300
Why is the 3DS not region free? Because it'll come out over here. Bad bats. Maru is making

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:04.980
a state. God damn it. This is amazing. While I would like to point out the project diva

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.900
F is being localized and will be eventually released in North America. Some people can't

01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:14.040
wait while I are. Yeah. Well, uh, all those DDR games and 2d X games and whatnot that

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:19.780
we have language writing and telling the wrong show, telling her my Japanese PlayStation

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:28.620
2 says hello. All right. And soon my Japanese 3DS. All right. Uh, let's go to the UK. Dark

01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:33.940
Sakura. Well, there's, we actually have a good number more in the UK than we did over

01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:41.740
here. Um, on the 10th is the novelist for Mac and PC. On the 11th is Angry Birds Go.

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:47.500
The 12th is, um, velocity ultra for PC. And on the 13th is stick it to the man and we

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:55.480
fit you. Stick it to the man. That's the best name ever. I didn't name my firstborn

01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:01.500
stick it to the man. Just a few more stories for you guys than the classic game of the

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.660
week. Uh, Y Y R in chat, by the way, saying you waited this long. The game's been out

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:12.700
over six months. That's true because, uh, the, um, that's true because the version that's

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:16.360
coming out in Japan this week is like a best hits type of thing. It's a price reduction

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:21.200
and Y Y R saying you could get the PlayStation 3 version right now. You know what? I do need

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:24.680
to get that game because I said I would buy it when it comes down in price and I think

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.280
it finally did. So I want to get Hatsune Miku, uh, here. All right. Anyway, back to some

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.280
news before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki. So like we talked about last

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:39.700
week with Forza 5 and their microtransactions, um, Gran Turismo 6 also had microtransactions

01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:44.680
and Sony of course claims that they are not required for players to advance in the game,

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:50.840
but you might say the same about the Forza 5 ones. Um, honestly haven't seen how I've

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:55.800
seen far less people complaining about these and the Forza ones, but I'm not really sure

01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:00.960
why considering they're both sound the same to me. I guess it's how it's presented. Um,

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.980
they're saying as with previous installments of Gran Turismo, users are able to earn in

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:10.920
game credits and unlock cars by competing in races. And, uh, if you want to buy credits,

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:16.360
they are in increments of 500 or half a million on the PlayStation network to speed up the

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:24.160
process of unlocking content. So I don't know. It sucks that there's microtransactions in

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:29.600
both games, but like I said, I haven't played either one, so I don't know how they're presented,

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:37.760
but that still sucks. Well, the impression that I'm getting from what I'm hearing about

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.960
it is that it's, it's really not like something they're trying to shove down your face or

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:46.120
anything. Like it's not, it's not like the stigma that a lot of free to play games have

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:49.520
where they're like pay to win and so forth. That's not really what they're doing in this

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:53.640
game because it's one of those things that's optional. You can, you can earn the stuff

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.360
in game, which you know is, is any Gran Turismo game kind of did that. Or you can buy it if

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:04.160
you are too impatient to wait and unlock the stuff yourself. Here's where I think people

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.920
get miffed at this kind of thing because I'm sure there's a lot of you sitting at home

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:13.400
going, you know, why is Loki mad? This isn't a big deal. I think some of us feel like,

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.800
especially some of us that really did the old school gaming and lived through the NES

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.720
phase and so forth. I remember a day when you would pause the game, press up, up, down,

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.720
down, left, right, left, right, BA, start, and now your ship is fully decked out with

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:27.440
everything you need to beat the game. And some of us, that's the only way we wanted

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.800
to play the game, right? Now, if you want the fully decked out ship, you could sign

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.480
on and pay $3.99 to get the special unlock key. You know who we have to blame? That's,

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:42.960
that's, that's, you know, who started this bullshit. It's always the same company that

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:50.280
starts this bullshit. EA. Cause remember it was with, I want to say the Godfather, the

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.640
PlayStation two version, have the codes that you can put in with the controller, just like

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.640
you would normally the original Xbox version, have the codes you put in the controller,

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:04.200
the Xbox 360 version, have the codes, or I should say the cheats that you buy on the

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:14.480
Xbox live marketplace. EA is the root of all evil. It's, it's, it's a joke. Yes. But in

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:20.080
the sense, yes they are. They are the root of all evil in the gaming industry because

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.080
they came up with the concept of this project, $10 thing where they would do these online

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.320
passes. Everybody jumped on that shit. They did this thing with, you know, like, Hey,

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.440
you know what? We can sell shit that we give away for free on other platforms because people

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.680
will buy him because they really want to do that stuff. And so let's just sell it. And

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.400
sure enough, they do it and it's just gone downhill from there. But they're the ones

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:50.120
that always seem to be, I don't know, innovating in that area, I guess if you will. So yes,

01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:56.600
I am throwing shade at them because it is ridiculous. And you know, did Loki just say

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:06.720
on the show that he's throwing shade? What can I say, Rob? You've rubbed off on me. What's

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:12.200
happened? I know I'm embarrassed myself. Well, you did say you had cooties before. I guess

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:17.520
so. I guess so. All right. Uh, okay. On a, on a much more serious note, cause this, uh,

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:22.880
this news sucks. There's really no easy way to put it. Uh, an actor named Danny Wells

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:28.160
passed away this week and he was 72 years old. Although you might not recognize the name,

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:34.160
you probably recognize the character. He played Luigi on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show when

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:39.280
it was on in the eighties. Um, with captain Lou. That's right. Captain Lou. Unfortunately,

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.840
he had passed away a few years ago, so, uh, the brothers are reunited. They have both

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:53.760
well, some people though, can't bear. They can't stand to not point out the irony that

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.600
Nintendo had made this the year of Luigi and this is how it ends. It's kind of one of those like,

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:04.120
wow, that joke's kind of sick, but it is, it is awkward. You know what I mean? Like,

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:09.200
I don't know what word to put on that. It is a little strange that this is the year was not

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:16.640
dead. Is he? No. John Lake was almost not dead. He played Luigi in the movie because just, yeah,

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:22.000
Bob Hoskins isn't dead either. So whatever. But Danny Wells did pass away this week. So, um,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.120
rest in peace and thanks for the memories from the Super Mario Brothers Super Show. All right,

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:33.000
let's travel back to a time in gaming's history. Can we get a real twisted version of the Super

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.920
Mario Brothers show with like Danny DeVito playing Mario or something like that? Never say

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:42.240
never. Anyway, I think he's too busy with the Always Sunny in Philadelphia show though. All

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:47.080
right. It's the classic game of the week. It's a chance for us to go into the gaming vault and

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:53.080
find a game where Dark Sakura says, Hey, why aren't you playing this? Maybe find a game where

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.760
Wikipedia isn't making me log in. I didn't know you had to log in. Yeah, I didn't think you had

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:04.080
to either. So let's see if this reloads. Okay. They get the classic game of the week is the

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:09.520
second of unreleased games that I have spoken about on the show. Although I've mentioned this

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:18.760
one many, many times. It's Thrill Kill. Yeah. So, um, it was an unpublished game from 1998 that came

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:24.720
out on the PlayStation. And the reason why I'm bringing this one up is the fact that it was

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:33.320
really one of the, uh, big games that sort of people were able to get ahold of it because of

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:38.120
the internet, you know, someone leaked out the version and since then we've had, you know,

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:47.000
plenty of other games come out, you know, didn't I bring up, uh, before I, uh, you know, Space

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.440
Fantasy Zone was the other game I had reviewed, but you know, there's been other ones too, like

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:57.120
the Crystal Dynamics, um, uh, Macross game, a Robotech game that never came out, but people

01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.080
have played it because the prototypes out online. Um, so Thrill Kill is one of those games. And the

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:07.120
big thing about this one is that it was supposed to be a four player fighting game, which I think

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.320
it got turned into that Wu-Tang Clan game or something the engine did. Um, but this one was

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:20.320
really a lot more of the, uh, BDSM, you know, had a lot more of the fetish thing and a lot more of

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:27.480
the, you know, crazy murder cannibalism cause it was gross. And then you had the character Judas

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:33.960
that one of the extra characters looked like Ken and Ryu attached to the torso, you know, with one

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:41.560
being upside down or the other. And by the way, that was like the single worst, uh, uh, ending of

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:49.280
that game too. Cause that was the first version I beat the game with. Um, so yeah, it was completed before, um, it was canceled and it

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:54.200
did get leaked out and now people are able to play it on emulators, modded consoles. I mean, we had,

01:32:54.200 --> 01:33:01.920
um, the, uh, Game Shark thing on ours. So we, you know, after we used to use the paperclip and then

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:07.480
after that we ended up using a Game Shark to play our downloads and stuff like that. So yeah, um, it

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:13.760
was developed by Paradox Development and then later Midway Los Angeles. And it was supposed to be

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:23.840
published by Virgin Interactive who was acquired by EA Pacific. Oh, EA. And then, um, EA canceled the game

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:29.080
because they didn't want to publish a senselessly violent game that would hurt their image. Like they

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:39.160
fucking needed it. Um, so anyway, um, that guy just like pretended to sodomize the other guy and then kick

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:46.000
him in the butt. That's just mean. Oh, she did it too. And then she hit him with an electric prod. Yeah, that's

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:58.400
Jamie. That's gross. This game is so gross. Okay, Rob's mom. Um, why don't you read a book? You know

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:08.440
what? That video that was on the internet just popped into my mind. Read a book, read a book, read a motherfucking book. Anyway,

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:15.640
um, it was the type of game that it is. It's a closed 3d room and basically four players fight to the death.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:23.520
It has, um, thrill kills, which are like fatalities and you build up a kill meter. Um, so your bloodlust rises.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:29.880
Ooh. And then you kill somebody in blood. It's gross. So basically the plot of the story is that 10 souls have gone

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:39.760
and descended into hell and their hell is based off of, um, the real world's, uh, sort of deviance, like the BDSM

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:51.680
person. You have Cletus, the, you know, butcher guy. You have, uh, uh, a Dr. Faustus is one of the characters. Um, I was

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:59.280
looking in chat room. Now I'm thinking buy some speed stick. It's not expensive. Anyway. Um, yeah, the chat room is

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:06.920
starting to quote that video. Maybe I should have made that cookie. Anyway. So moving forward is basically, um, each

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:14.880
of the characters is a murderer and, um, they are being judged and so are put into fighting so that one of them can

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:25.840
reincarnate. Um, they go in hopes of being reborn. So yeah, the game, um, it was really, um, like the official US

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:32.520
PlayStation magazine counted as one of the most overrated canceled games and they were very, uh, correct with their

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:38.320
quote. It got lots of hype, but it really sucked too. We just played this because it was hilarious. So yeah, I was

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:46.040
right. It was remade into Wu-Tang Shaolin style and, um, the engine was also used for a two player X-Men Mutant

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:52.520
Academy, um, that was put out by Activision and its sequel and Rock'em Sock'em Robots Arena that was put out by

01:35:52.520 --> 01:36:02.400
Mattel. Um, and Game Informer linked this, uh, 10th on a list of the top 10 games that almost were. It really was

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:12.880
very bad. The music in this was done by an industrial band called Contagion and another group called Dying Fetus did

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:19.040
music that was incorporated into the game, but was not recorded exclusively for Thrill Kill. And that is the classic

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:25.640
game. And I had to bring it up because again, this was one of the first really big ones that spread because of the

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:37.480
internet. And so while it was a festering pile of shit, because it really was, it was notable for being internet

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:44.880
related. Some movies are classics because they're so bad, like Showgirls, right? So, you know, a classic game can

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:53.040
still be one that, uh, you know, is of questionable taste like that one, which is gross. Well, maybe you should go

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:59.880
read a book, read a book, get some speed stick. It's not expensive. All right. Uh, that's gonna do it for this first

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.240
half of the show, but we have plenty more show to come, including the Fugu Question of the Week, rapid fire news,

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:10.600
your emails, your phone calls, much more. And yes, there might even, if you're all good kids just in time for the

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:18.080
holidays, I may have a story near the end about pornography. So stay tuned and we'll get to all that and more when we

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.320
come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:35.480
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this December the 8th of 2013 with the 530th episode of

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:42.720
our program. Uh, all right. We've had a lot of gaming news so far, but there's plenty more news to come. So let's get

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:43.840
right back into it. Loki.

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:56.120
All right. Um, so let's talk a little bit about, um, one of the announcements that was at the whole VGX and that was

01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:06.600
that Cranky Kong is going to be the new character that's joined the roster for Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze. Yes, this

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:15.120
was the big announcement that Nintendo had been teasing about on Twitter and everybody everywhere else that they got on

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:23.040
the show to share this incredibly important piece of information. Oh, and the release date of February 21st. What a

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.080
wasted opportunity.

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:32.400
Well, if they've got nothing else to say, I mean, I don't even bother being there. I mean, seriously. Well, I don't know.

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:38.680
Like I get the whole like wanting to build hype for the game that's coming out and everything, but I think, and I don't know

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:45.680
who's to really to blame for this, if it's Nintendo's fault or if it's internet slash fans fault that this was hyped up, like OMG,

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.440
they're going to show a new Zelda. They're not going to show. I don't think that they would do that, but like, but there was

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:56.200
people out there that that was the expectation bar in some people's heads, you know, it's just, it's not even that exciting of

01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:03.240
news. I mean, it's, I agree. It was, it was, it was blown up to be way bigger than what it ended up being. But I mean, this is

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.320
like, this is like kind of one of those bullet points that they go and, you know, during their Nintendo directs, Oh, and by the

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:14.200
way, we have those exclusive news on a new character for blah, blah, blah. I mean, it was something that really didn't need to

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:22.440
be, you know, he didn't need to go to this show to do that. I will say though, that there's a part of me that does kind of see

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:28.760
the humor and that Nintendo really hyped up that they were going to give VGX a big exclusive. And then they kind of pooped on

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:36.480
that. Like that is kind of funny in a way you have to, you have to see the humor in that at least that is kind of, I mean, I don't

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:42.920
know. I'm sure they would have to have shared the news with them, but it'd been kind of, let's just play make believe here for a

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:47.060
little bit. It would have been funny that they didn't tell them what they was. And so they, Oh yeah, we're gonna give them on the

01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:55.100
shows. It's gonna be incredible. Yeah. And they dropped the bomb. Hey, cranky gongs and donkey code. What? That's what you

01:39:55.100 --> 01:40:02.340
had? Seriously? Scott of Tron and chat says the host seemed pissed after this announcement. So maybe they didn't. They did

01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:07.140
see you have his, they're like, Oh, what about like news on a Metroid or something like that? I heard some people on Twitter

01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:13.580
were saying that it almost came off as rude, like that Nintendo, that they were kind of rude to Nintendo. I mean, again, that

01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:18.460
could be through fandom lens. I didn't watch it, but what was your impression? Did you see that? I saw the clip because they

01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:26.700
have this like kind of, you know, uh, edited clip thing of all the moments of the show, you know, all the like shit that went

01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:35.980
down and I did see that and I don't know. I, my reaction probably would have been the same thing. Like, Ooh, cool. No, really.

01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:40.500
What's your, what's your special little exclusive announcement that you're going to have? I mean, that was a cool trailer and

01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:46.500
you know, Donkey Kong, but what's your real announcement? Oh, that was the real announcement. Oh, you're going to give us a

01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:54.900
release date? Grool. And that's what he said. He's like, Hey, but I already gave your release date and yeah, I caught the, I

01:40:54.900 --> 01:41:01.620
caught the joke and I gave you the release date and this new exclude character. What else did you want? You're like, fuck

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:09.420
something else. You know, I, that's kind of the reaction that it seemed like that they were giving. And yeah, I seriously, it's

01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:16.580
like, who gives a shit? I mean, it's, it's not like it's, I don't know. It's not that big a deal. I mean, yeah, that's cool.

01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:22.380
It's a playable character. All I'm saying is that Nintendo may not be the ones to really blame for that. And if you look at it

01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:30.940
from a trolling perspective, it's great. I understand that. But who, who is this? I mean, Nintendo has to understand where

01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:38.700
their dera demographic is, who is watching an award show about video games, not casual people that play video games. It's

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:44.540
people that are fucking dedicated hardcore into video games. They're going to spend the time watching a video games award

01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:53.980
show. And when you put this out there, no one gives a shit. In fact, they just, it further reinforces the fact that Nintendo

01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:58.700
just doesn't get what I want. You know? Yeah. Like this would have been a great time to announce, I mean, to be, to be fair,

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:04.340
it's, I'm not like, I'm not totally defending Nintendo here or whatever, because this is a, this would be a great

01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:09.980
opportunity to come out and say, virtual console games will now be playable across the internet and the camera on your

01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:16.740
Wii U, you can see your opponent. Like, how amazing would that be? Except that is never going to happen. That's what

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:20.820
frustrates people about Nintendo. Even if you want to do something lame like announce a character or something, do it for a

01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:26.100
game that your hardcore fan base is actually going to go after, which would be Smash Brothers. You know, now it's a new

01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:31.620
Smash Brothers character or something. Cranky Kong is the new Smash Brothers character. Okay, that's a little bit more

01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:40.140
interesting now. Yeah. You know, it's just this, whatever. For me, I'm not buying the game. I don't even own the console, so it's

01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:47.380
not a big deal, but it's just kind of like, you had the opportunity to hype this big thing and then you could have just, I've been on

01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:53.420
the fence about this Donkey Kong game. I don't really, you know, I like the Donkey Kong Country games, but I just don't, I don't

01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:59.260
know. I just kind of feel like there'll be other stuff I want to play when this game comes out. This didn't exactly sway me into

01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:05.180
the must buy category. Let's just put it that way. Donkey Kong Country was special when it was on Super Nintendo. Yes, and I think

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:09.860
it's, I think that's, for me, I'm going to be honest, I think that series is a little played out for me. Yeah, now it's been there done

01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:18.820
that because there's nothing really advanced graphically or gameplay wise that wasn't done. But then again, then again, Nintendo

01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:24.420
does platformers very well. This new Mario game is one of the best of the year. But this is the thing is they're trying to, they're

01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:31.140
kind of saying, Hey, you know, new Super Mario Brothers sold pretty well. Let's take the new Super Mario Brothers gameplay and we'll

01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:37.260
inject it into yet another game. And that's kind of what they're doing. It's like, Oh, Hey, four player co-op is what's going to be in

01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:42.660
this game. I'm assuming because they have another character now. Yeah. So there's gonna be four player co-op in this. And it's

01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:49.020
basically new, new Donkey Kong Country, or, you know, I mean, it's kind of what it seems like to me so much for rapid fire.

01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:55.460
Act-def made the same point based off the description of the character. He saw the, he made exactly the same point that I was going to

01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:57.260
Scrooge McCranky Kong.

01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:00.380
Kinda. Oh, all right, let's move on.

01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:09.540
Anyways, Final Fantasy 8 came out on Steam. Some people hated it. Some people loved it. It's $11.99. Same price as Final Fantasy 7. That's

01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:18.540
it. Oh, and they tweaked some things. The Chocobo World thing that was a PocketStation thing. That's actually now synced with the game. I

01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:26.220
guess you can launch that and play that as well. Um, and then they also have the option to, I think, boost your magic in the game to

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:32.540
like level 100. Um, just by putting an option in to make it, I guess, easier. So you don't have to draw as much.

01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:40.460
That's welcome. That's a welcome change. Okay. Now, now I might buy it. Yeah. Now I'm, uh, yeah, I, this changes everything.

01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:42.820
Rob, we need to let's play.

01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:44.620
I'll think about it. Okay.

01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:47.380
All right. And then, uh, it goes on sale.

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:53.260
Kelly, I got to read a real quick comment in the chat about the Nintendo thing and it's, it's really good. So I need to get this out there.

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:59.700
As the 200 Matt says, but you know what? Nintendo still makes bank, so they don't have to announce anything. Sadly, it bothers people

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:06.460
because Nintendo comes off like the old uncle who keeps giving their nephews the same gift every year for Christmas, the past 20 years.

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.020
I like it when that gift is money.

01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:10.260
I thought that analogy was pretty clever anyway.

01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:17.660
Well, Nintendo's, I mean, to be fair, Nintendo, if we're going to go back to it, Nintendo is starting to serialize their Mario games.

01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:21.260
You know, we give all these other companies shit for releasing yearly released games.

01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:23.340
Nintendo's kind of done that with Mario.

01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:27.100
It's starting to get kind of redundant.

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:30.900
Like I don't, I mean, Mario games are good and stuff, but let's, let's mix it up.

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:33.740
Like, like I would love to see a new franchise for Nintendo.

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:40.820
I would love that, you know, instead of Mario, Metroid, Zelda, Kirby, I guess.

01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:46.180
I would almost buy that argument except for two big, big reasons.

01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:52.900
A, the Mario games are almost bar none some of the best of the year every single time they come out.

01:45:52.980 --> 01:46:00.860
And you know, you don't hear that about a Madden game or even about DDR or whatever serial game you want to talk about because that Mario 3D world is on point.

01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:06.780
And you know, if they can crank out something like that, then every year, then bring me it every year because that game is fucking amazing.

01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:12.180
B, Nintendo has tried some other franchises and they flopped.

01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:13.300
Steel Diver.

01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:16.500
Have they really tried?

01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:18.100
Was that really an attempt?

01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:24.500
They put it out as, you know, a somewhat launch title for the 3DS and then that was it.

01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:26.260
They didn't support it any further than that.

01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:27.420
It wasn't really an attempt.

01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:28.540
Nintendo Land.

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:31.940
Monita isn't exactly going to be an in-demand Smash Brothers character.

01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:33.020
Let's be real.

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.460
Monita's a little done.

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:38.460
Monita's going to get unplugged after that one.

01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:38.860
Come on.

01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.100
I don't know.

01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:42.060
I just think that there's a lot more they could be doing.

01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:45.580
Final Fantasy Realm Reborn.

01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:49.340
PlayStation 4 version is going to launch April 2014.

01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:51.180
At least that's what's been announced in Japan.

01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:53.180
Well, we found when you're going to get your system again, Rob.

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:53.860
Right.

01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:59.100
I think it's probably most likely going to have probably around the same time for North America as well.

01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:00.660
So that's exciting.

01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:03.940
And that was a 100% completely accurate statement by Jason.

01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:06.660
YYR makes a very good point.

01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:09.620
How about a new Star Fox that plays like Star Fox?

01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:10.500
How about a new F-Zero?

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.620
Developed by Nintendo.

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:13.500
Yes.

01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:20.420
Well, here I have some Nintendo news that, you know, might, I don't know, might change things a little bit.

01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:22.180
But honestly, this one, not really.

01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:27.300
Because Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams could be coming to Wii U in 2014.

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:30.340
Some of the new DLC for the Wii U.

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:37.420
Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, it's a good game, but it's like, this isn't the type of news that's really going to turn a lot of heads.

01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:38.860
It's just, okay, you know, cool.

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:40.940
Indie's on Wii U, still going there.

01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:44.020
And it's nice to hear about DLC actually working on Wii U.

01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:45.620
So, cool.

01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:47.220
So there you go.

01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:58.340
They do say now, in an interview with the studio head, Arian Gorsh, says that the Wii U version is more fun than other console versions because it was revised for a cleaner cut.

01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:02.420
And they say the Wii U is the best console for indie releases.

01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:11.700
That's what makes this noteworthy, if nothing else, is that, you know, even though some big studios are turning away and shunning the Wii U, some of the indies really, really love it.

01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:15.820
Some other people that really, really love the Wii U, Time Magazine.

01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:26.540
And usually I wouldn't note these types of things, but when it's coming from something that's a little more mainstream and not like gamer or tech focused, like Time Magazine, and granted they have different sections.

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:37.660
But Time Magazine came out with an article that said, these are 10 reasons why this holiday season you should get a Wii U and not a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One.

01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:50.380
And this isn't really something that the media at large is really talking about because everybody's focusing on PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 1, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, like a lot of people kind of already written off Wii U.

01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:55.460
But a time writer, Matt Peckham, came out and said, you know what, here's some reasons why you should choose the Wii U.

01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:56.580
It boils down to this.

01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:59.140
Number one, it has the games you want to play now.

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:02.100
Number two, and it'll have the games you want to play next year.

01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:05.780
Number three, the Wii U game pad is a portable console.

01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:08.340
That's a little sketch.

01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.620
And I'm also kind of scratching-

01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:12.260
And by portable you mean within your house then maybe.

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:19.660
And I'm also scratching my head at the games you want to play next year and the games you want to play now because what if those games have to be from EA, then you're not playing those games.

01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:25.180
Number four, it is $300, which is $100 less than the PlayStation 4, so it's the cheapest.

01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:28.300
Number five, there's no annual subscription fee.

01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:31.260
Number six, it's high def enough.

01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:35.140
Number seven, Wii U games are cheaper on balance.

01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:37.340
I think that has to do with DLC and all that.

01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:39.940
Number eight, Nintendo has the eShop.

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.620
Sony and Microsoft have Nada.

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.740
That makes no sense to me where he was going with that bullet point because-

01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:48.300
Yeah, I didn't get that one there, I straight up laughed at that one.

01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:51.980
This whole article seems kind of, you know, pantsy.

01:49:52.380 --> 01:50:03.620
Yes, but I think there's too many people that have written off the Wii U when I think in some ways the Wii U does make a decent case where it could be the system this year.

01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:08.740
And you can wait on the other systems until next year because it does have more games that are available, period.

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:18.380
I'll tell you what, since I was such a great marketing person for the PlayStation 4 last week, allow me to provide my services for the Wii U.

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:22.660
The Wii U is a good choice for your family.

01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:30.220
It has a lot of great family games, especially if you love the Nintendo games that you played a long time ago, it's going to have a lot of your favorite classics and stuff.

01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:32.420
And that's what you're looking for. This is going to be a great console for you.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:37.060
Plus the second screen controller is awesome when someone wants to watch TV or play something else or whatever.

01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:38.900
I mean, it's great as far as that goes.

01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:44.420
And yes, it is cool that you don't have to pay for an online subscription for their online service.

01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:45.820
That's a plus.

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:50.500
And also a lot of the games are going to be cheaper, usually.

01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:59.820
Then again, also there's, I don't know, I should say a lot more family friendly options for the Wii U.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:03.180
And what else could I possibly say?

01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:07.780
If you like Mario and Zelda games that much, get one.

01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:13.300
It's also the only console that's kind of focused on family gameplay and more local gameplay as well.

01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:16.100
And it's also a console that's very friendly to indie games.

01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:20.780
So you're going to find a lot of the games that have the same features and kind of gameplay that you...

01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:22.980
That's funny because that was dude's number nine.

01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:25.620
It has an indie lineup, has a decent indie lineup.

01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:31.340
By the way, just to clarify the eShop thing, the writer was talking more about the virtual console and the backwards compatibility

01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:35.860
where you can play the Nintendo, Super Nintendo and Wii games all because of virtual console.

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:38.100
It wasn't so much the fact that it has an online store.

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:41.180
It was more what's available in that store, the classic games.

01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:48.180
And then number 10, his reason is that it is more than just a game system with the whole TV and remote integration.

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:56.100
Again, that bullet point's a little bit shaky because Xbox One, you can do the whole watch TV in your Xbox.

01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:59.940
I mean, it's... I don't see where... I mean, I like... Don't get me wrong.

01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:06.340
I'm not knocking what Wii U does because that TV stuff where you can chat during like big TV events is different.

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:10.420
It's neat, but it's not... I don't think it's nearly as strong of a bullet point.

01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:12.060
I think if you're honestly looking...

01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:18.020
If you're buying a console for your family and you haven't bought a game console ever or in a long time,

01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:22.980
I say your best option is probably to go PlayStation 3 and Xbox or Xbox 360.

01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:24.500
They're gonna be cheaper than the Wii U.

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:27.860
There's a lot more games, a lot cheaper games out there,

01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:32.340
and they're gonna have the games you're gonna wanna play this year and next year as well.

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:34.660
Plus, you can use it for TV and all that other stuff.

01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:38.100
Not knocking the Wii U as far as that goes, but they just don't...

01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:42.100
They have games that, you know, they have the Nintendo games and you're only gonna be able to find them there.

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:44.820
And, you know...

01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:46.340
Alright, we gotta get past this.

01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:47.860
Buy a 3DS. There you go.

01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:51.140
The things that Nintendo has to work on, according to the article, just to be fair.

01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:53.460
Drop the system price again.

01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:58.820
We need a new killer Zelda or Metroid or new Nintendo IP we haven't seen before.

01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:00.420
Almost echoing what we just said.

01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:05.620
And needs more third-party games, which I really don't know how they're gonna get out of that one.

01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:08.420
It may take throwing money at people. We'll see.

01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:10.740
Alright, one other thing I wanna talk about...

01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:13.380
Wait a second. I gotta ask here.

01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.220
It says, thanks, Colette, at the bottom there.

01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:19.140
And then at the very top, though, it's written by a guy named, you know...

01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:22.580
This particular website was tipped off from somebody else, probably.

01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:27.380
Colette tipped off my Nintendo news about the time article.

01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:30.100
Oh, okay, got it. Matt Peck...

01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:31.060
Okay, I...

01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:32.100
Okay, so that...

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:32.600
I...

01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:34.020
Should've looked where...

01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:34.900
I don't know.

01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:36.420
It just seemed very vague.

01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:39.540
It was very thrown, extended, multiple...

01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:40.100
Yeah.

01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:40.500
Alright.

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.540
Alright, moving on.

01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:47.220
There's some news about the Typing of the Dead DLC for Typing of the Dead Overkill.

01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:48.340
This time...

01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:50.340
Now, you might be thinking, Rob, didn't you talk about this last week?

01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.980
But no, this is different, because this one is free!

01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:55.460
Free DLC, as opposed to having to pay for it.

01:53:55.460 --> 01:54:02.020
So, this DLC will turn the game's phrases into lines of commentary from Football Manager.

01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:06.580
So, if you wanna type football phrases, such as,

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:14.340
horror leg break, spooned it over, agent's fees, little flick off, Manchester Derby...

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:17.940
If you wanna type any of those phrases, you can do that.

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:19.860
It's cute, and it's free.

01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:20.820
So, cool.

01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:23.380
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:24.340
I have some stuff.

01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:32.580
First of all, for fans of the Ys series, there is a fan translation for Ys V.

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:39.780
That was, it never came out in the US, it came out in 1995 on the Super Famicom,

01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:46.020
and instead of the type of combat that the earlier Ys games had,

01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:50.660
it was a lot more Zelda-like, for lack of a better description.

01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:54.580
And since, basically, if I do remember correctly,

01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.740
I think it's the same group that did Ys IV Dawn of Ys.

01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.620
So, if you want it, go get it.

01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:09.140
Also, Ultra Street Fighter IV will actually be available as a digital upgrade,

01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:13.860
that is going to be for $14.99 in early June.

01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:17.220
That's also the same price as in terms of Euros,

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:20.100
so they're actually kind of getting it a little bit cheaper than...

01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:24.260
No, they're getting it more expensive than we are.

01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:25.220
So, oops.

01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:30.180
So, you can get the full bundle, however, for $40.

01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:37.380
And I watched the location testing for it.

01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:38.580
Some pretty neat stuff.

01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:40.980
Poison actually was pretty, pretty badass.

01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:45.860
And then, for Video Games Live,

01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:51.220
Akira Yamaoka is going to be at the Dubai show on December 13th.

01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:54.740
So, if you're there, film it, and send it to me.

01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:57.620
And stalk him for me, because...

01:55:58.980 --> 01:55:59.540
Yeah.

01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.740
I mean, no.

01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:01.240
Oh, no.

01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:03.400
All right.

01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:06.820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:10.180
He...

01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:16.420
Yamaoka did the soundtrack, or some aspect thereof, to Bioshock?

01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:18.820
Where's an evil?

01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:20.020
I'm confused about this.

01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:23.540
I think that's just some of the other stuff that they're playing.

01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:26.100
That his spin on it could be...

01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:26.500
Maybe.

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:26.980
Could be.

01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:31.060
It's either his spin on it, or it's just something Video Games Live plays the music from that stuff.

01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:32.900
I was very confused for a moment to continue.

01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.980
I think it's Video Games Live, probably.

01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:35.220
Yeah.

01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:36.660
All right.

01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:38.740
Let's get into the FUGL question of the week.

01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:41.780
You take Facebook, you take Google, you smash it together, you get FUGL.

01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:55.860
Let's go to our question, as we do post every week on our Facebook page.

01:56:55.860 --> 01:57:02.020
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio

01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:05.300
are the places where you can follow us on the social networkings.

01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:09.940
And we thought this week, in honor of Danny Wells, who passed away this week,

01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:13.140
we thought we'd ask a question about 80s and 90s television shows,

01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:14.900
based on video games and gaming culture.

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:16.580
You guys have your favorites, I'm sure.

01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:18.420
Did you watch any of them growing up?

01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:19.460
What were your favorites?

01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:22.020
Do you have any memories you want to share about those games?

01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:22.900
So let's get to it.

01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:25.460
Just a couple answers here over on Google Plus.

01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:30.660
Rhetortainment says, wait, I thought John Languizamo died.

01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:33.540
I remember John from my first hangover when I watched Land of the Dead,

01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:35.780
because it was on TNT and I didn't want to move.

01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:37.700
That was a nice way to spend a Tuesday afternoon.

01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:38.420
I think there was rumors...

01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:40.260
Somebody else from Land of the Dead died, though.

01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:43.140
There was rumors about him a few years ago, but it's not true.

01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:48.100
Just like the kid from the Wonder Years is not Marilyn Manson.

01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:50.820
And what other big rumors are out there?

01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.020
Anyway, all right.

01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:56.500
ActDeaf replied on Google Plus and says, as many will probably say,

01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.660
I watched the Super Mario Brothers Super Show,

01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:03.060
though I always waited anxiously every Friday for the Legend of Zelda episode.

01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:05.140
It was cheesy as hell, but it was the 80s.

01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:08.420
So excuse me, princess.

01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:11.060
But my favorite video game show or cartoon from back in the 90s

01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:14.260
is probably Sonic the Hedgehog or Sonic Saturday AM.

01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:16.020
That series was freaking awesome.

01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:20.500
I also lived for Zelda Fridays myself.

01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:22.580
That was like, if I were to answer this question,

01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.060
Zelda Fridays were where it was at.

01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:28.340
That and somebody had said it here on Facebook.

01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:29.940
I'll read this answer from Degenerate Johnny.

01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:31.300
This is my other answer.

01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:33.460
If I could name one video game show from my childhood,

01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:35.140
it would be StarCade.

01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.300
It was an 80s game show, pun intended,

01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:40.260
that challenged the skills and video game knowledge of gamers,

01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:41.860
which was a real treat to watch.

01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:44.260
Back in the good old days of G4,

01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:47.380
the network re-aired old episodes of StarCade,

01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:51.300
which brought back fond memories I felt when I first saw the show.

01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:54.580
That would also be my other answer.

01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:56.020
I loved game shows.

01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:57.380
I lived for game shows growing up.

01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:59.700
I watched game show network when I could,

01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:01.380
when it was, you know, early available.

01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:03.220
USA used to show a bunch of old game shows too.

01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:04.020
I remember that.

01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:07.860
And so, yeah, I loved that show.

01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:10.900
And honestly, it would be my dream.

01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:14.340
If I could do anything in my little broadcasting career,

01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:17.940
quote unquote, getting to host a remake of StarCade

01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:19.860
would be my ultimate dream in life.

01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:22.260
But, you know, I know that that's going to be

01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:23.620
a little bit difficult to do.

01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:25.940
But if you ask me,

01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:27.540
what do you really want to do more than anything?

01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:32.420
I would love to host a resurgence of that show StarCade,

01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:34.260
because that game, that show was awesome.

01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:38.420
Unfortunately, with arcades kind of on their way out,

01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:39.220
I don't know.

01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:41.780
It would have to be focused on retro games or something.

01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:45.540
Maybe with the King of Kong and how well that does and all that.

01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:45.860
All right.

01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:46.820
Anyway.

01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:48.900
Barcade.

01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.540
Yeah, you never know.

01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:52.180
Let's see some other answers here.

01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:57.140
KJ says very fond memories of GameProTV.

01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:59.380
Captain and the GameMaster, Super Mario Bros. Super Show,

01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:01.940
and the short lived Legend of Zelda cartoon.

02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:03.860
Although I used to yell at my TV when those kids

02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:06.180
were playing video game challenges on Nick Arcade.

02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:08.420
Mainly because those kids couldn't play Neo Geo games

02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:09.380
to save their lives.

02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:12.180
Or any other system for that matter.

02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:15.220
Tiger Claw says as a kid growing up in the 80s,

02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:17.380
I remember watching Saturday Supercade,

02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:20.100
a block of cartoons based on classic 80s arcade games

02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:23.380
like Donkey Kong, which was Mario's first appearance on TV.

02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:25.700
I remember watching all cartoon versions of the first three

02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:27.060
Super Mario games as well.

02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:30.180
Captain and the GameMaster was also my favorite series growing up.

02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:34.500
Ronnie B says Pokemon, if that counts.

02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:36.100
Why not?

02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:37.220
It does.

02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:37.620
It does.

02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:39.140
Let's see.

02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:44.900
Fifth Dream says I like the crap out of the Qbert cartoon when I was a kid.

02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:47.060
And I still get the theme song from the pole position

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:49.060
cartoon stuck in my head now and then.

02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:51.780
I also liked a Dragon Quest anime called Dragon Warrior

02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:53.780
that I recorded every week on VHS.

02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:55.220
You know what?

02:00:55.220 --> 02:00:57.620
I actually, I just mentioned Qbert in the chat room.

02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:00.340
I used to watch that too because it was sort of like,

02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.900
they're on another planet, but they're based off of 50s American culture.

02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:04.740
And Pac-Man.

02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:07.860
Jonko, one of our friends from Koopa Club replied and said,

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:10.820
I used to watch Captain N every morning before school.

02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:13.460
And then when I came home, I'd run around with my NES controller

02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:16.260
wrapped around my waist like a belt, brandishing my zapper.

02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:19.860
I convinced myself that I was going to be Captain N when I grew up.

02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:23.780
20 years later, I made it happen through the magic of cosplay.

02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:24.100
Awesome.

02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:26.580
And by the way, I just want to point out Jonko's little icon right now,

02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:30.100
his little user picture is his cap, is Captain N cosplay.

02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:30.980
So props to you.

02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:34.340
One more answer here from Raginator who said,

02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:37.380
yeah, I watched stuff like Captain N, Super Mario Brothers Super Show,

02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:39.700
and it's ilk back in the late 80s and early 90s.

02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:42.580
Even then I thought that the quality of shows were kind of crappy,

02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:45.780
but considered the overall lack of any real meaningful choices

02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:49.060
of gaming related programming, I felt resigned to picking the

02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:51.460
less crappy of the crappy.

02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:53.220
Those are some of the answers from Facebook.

02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:57.700
If you want to see the rest, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

02:01:58.260 --> 02:01:59.780
Any other shows that y'all want to bring up?

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.620
I think that the chatters hit on mine.

02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:03.060
Well, there was the Pac-Man one.

02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:07.300
Yeah, even the Christmas special, which I actually went back and watched.

02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:08.660
It was horrible.

02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:11.380
I knew I watched Captain N.

02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:13.620
I hated how the characters were characterized,

02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:15.780
but I loved seeing the different worlds that they'd go to.

02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:17.140
I thought the Game Boy was stupid.

02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:21.300
And while it isn't a video game one, it's definitely one of those 80s

02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:26.100
things that had to do with the whole pop music thing was I actually liked kid video.

02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:28.020
Do you remember that?

02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:28.740
I do.

02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:29.060
I do.

02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:31.940
And there was another, there was another game show where at the end,

02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:35.300
if they did well, they would run through and grab like all the video games they could.

02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:36.500
With the velcro vest?

02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:37.060
Yes.

02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:37.460
Yes.

02:02:38.100 --> 02:02:39.860
Somebody in chattel shouted out.

02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.180
I used to watch that every Saturday.

02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:43.620
Yeah, that was the other big video game show.

02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:44.740
That one was awesome.

02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:48.020
And then, um, I watched Game Pro TV,

02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:50.260
especially when they did the Neo Geo review,

02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:51.700
because I used to have that one on tape.

02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:55.380
And then I moved out here and Dan had a Neo Geo.

02:02:55.940 --> 02:02:58.100
And I was like, holy shit, these exist.

02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:00.500
You know, so it was pretty funny.

02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:06.340
And, um, I, I loved, uh, I, I really liked Pole Position,

02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:07.860
which I've got all of that downloaded.

02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:08.980
Thank you, Tiger Claw.

02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:10.580
Video Power was the name of it.

02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:12.180
Video Power, that was definitely it.

02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:16.580
Do we used to have a listener named Vid Power?

02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:17.060
We did.

02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:17.620
Yeah, we did.

02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:18.120
Yeah.

02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:23.720
Um, a couple, there was, there was another one that I used to...

02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:24.840
Nick Arcade.

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:25.320
Nah.

02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:26.280
Well, what about, what about you guys?

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:30.120
Well, she's thinking, Loki, Jason, anything you want to throw out there?

02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:31.560
I missed most of those.

02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:33.960
And I think that's because I'm just a few years younger than you guys.

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:34.520
I wasn't...

02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:35.240
Oh, rub it in.

02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:36.680
I, I don't...

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:37.640
Nick Arcade though.

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:39.240
I was like a teenager when that was out.

02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.400
Well, that's been rerun to fucking infinity, unlike every other show.

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:43.800
True.

02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:45.800
Um, so Nick Arcade is what I live for.

02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:52.360
There was one that, that, that made me, uh, react in similar ways that wasn't actually

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:53.560
video game related.

02:03:53.560 --> 02:04:01.240
Um, I caught it on, uh, Fox Family, ABC, whatever that, that network has been, uh, called Masters

02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:01.880
of the Maze.

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:08.040
Um, it was, it was a, it was a trivia game and you run through the maze with this big

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:13.560
suit and, uh, the, your, your assistant uses the joystick to tell you which way to go and

02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:18.200
you have all these good gadgets and doodads on your vest that don't actually do anything

02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:19.160
in a blind or visor.

02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.280
It was, it was silly.

02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:20.840
Uh, yeah.

02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:22.920
And love Nick, Nick, Nick Arcade.

02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:29.800
Um, when I was thinking about shows that I used to watch, PBS had this afterschool special

02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:35.720
show called Square One and they had, yes, yes, that show was the bomb.

02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:36.760
Math, Math Man.

02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:40.440
Yeah, that show was the shit that came to mind as soon as you guys were talking about

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:42.120
and math net.

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.960
I, that was like one of my favorite shows.

02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:44.600
It was awesome.

02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:47.000
I used to fucking run the fuck home so I could watch Square One.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:47.960
Like what a nerd.

02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:50.840
I'm running home to watch educational programming, but that show was the shit.

02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:52.600
I am glad people are reacting to the show.

02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:53.000
Yes.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:53.400
Oh God.

02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:54.840
You never, ever heard of it.

02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:55.560
Oh, in chat room.

02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:56.600
I'm sure they're lighting up too.

02:04:56.600 --> 02:04:57.160
There was that.

02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:59.000
And then three, two, one contact was huge.

02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:05.320
Um, I was a little, little, little too young for electric company.

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:06.440
I don't remember that as much.

02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:06.760
Yeah.

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:08.760
I, I remember electric company.

02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:16.520
So that one was, uh, was definitely one for me, but I'm trying to, to,

02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.240
now I'm actually having to pull up a list to remember.

02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:19.640
Hold on.

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:20.680
I've got something for Jason.

02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:21.080
You ready?

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:21.640
You ready?

02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:22.440
You ready, Jason?

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:25.640
You've already seen this much of Square One TV.

02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:26.920
How much do you figure is left?

02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:29.800
This is 0.44 on the screen.

02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:30.200
Here we go.

02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:37.000
Math Man, your mission is to eat only multiples of six.

02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:40.280
When you encounter a number, you will have until the count of three to make your decision.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.360
Oh no, not the glitch.

02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:48.680
Why did they ever turn this into an actual game?

02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:51.320
Like we had 72.

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.280
Is that a multiples of six?

02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:52.780
Quick.

02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:54.200
He ate it.

02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:54.920
He's right.

02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:55.420
Okay.

02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:56.760
Um, why is it?

02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:58.520
This is why they didn't turn it into a game.

02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:02.920
Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man.

02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:04.280
They had number munchers.

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:05.640
I think so.

02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:07.400
Yeah, but that wasn't.

02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:09.480
Number, number, number, number, number, number.

02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.360
844.

02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:20.040
So I was looking at other stuff, other ones, Rob, and there was like a really crappy Street

02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:25.000
Fighter cartoon American done that wasn't, you know, actually as good as any of the anime

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:25.500
were.

02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:31.640
And I know that the, I think that the game was based off of, there was Battle Toads,

02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:33.000
you know, which was pretty funny.

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:39.720
Um, there was a, there was a Mortal Kombat cartoon that was really awful.

02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:41.880
Um, and Double Dragon.

02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:47.000
Our, our, our buddy from video game realness, uh, Mega Man 400 is in chat saying no one

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.440
watched the Mega Man cartoon.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.200
Cause nobody mentioned it.

02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:57.240
I caught, I remember wanting to, I think I caught like five minutes of it while I was,

02:06:57.880 --> 02:06:59.480
it was absurdly early in the morning.

02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:02.280
So I woke up, caught a pinch of it and fell back to sleep.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:03.320
Wow.

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:06.280
Queen Samia says they have an updated electric company going on now.

02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:07.240
Do they really?

02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:09.400
I have to see kind of awesome.

02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:10.760
I love the electric company.

02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:11.260
All right.

02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:17.960
The square one stuff though, just to say we actually had this thing for my homeroom, um,

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:25.400
that was square one for school where we would get a news alert thing and then they would

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:29.960
show like the math man and they would show just little segments and then do, and this

02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:31.800
is what's going on with science right now.

02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:36.120
So we'd get kind of like a, a special version of square one at school.

02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:37.320
So it was kind of cool.

02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:42.200
We are currently being yelled at and lectured by a Mega Man 400 in chat for the lack of

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:43.480
the Mega Man cartoon.

02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:45.880
Uh, at some point, I guess I'll have to check that out.

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:49.960
Uh, Tiger Claw says there were cartoons that were single shot episodes.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.400
Even Bubsy had one.

02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:52.120
Oh God.

02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:52.600
Wow.

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:53.560
Bubsy 3D?

02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:54.440
Act F'd?

02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:54.940
No.

02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:56.440
What does Act F say?

02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:58.360
I loved Reboot 2 as a kid.

02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.960
I tried to rewatch it on Netflix.

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:01.400
It was terrible.

02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:02.680
All right.

02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:03.640
Uh, we got to move on.

02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:04.920
There's still more gaming news to get to.

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:09.080
We could do an entire three hour episode about children's TV shows that we grew up on.

02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:12.120
Uh, and maybe that'll happen over the holidays when it's really slow.

02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:15.160
Uh, that could be like a good list list, but for now we got to get to more gaming news.

02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:19.640
So, you know, we just need to do, we need to do a spinoff show called 30 something T

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:20.440
uh, radio.

02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:25.400
30, the geeks who were in their thirties, the radio show.

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:25.880
Oh my God.

02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:27.960
That you might be onto something dark soccer.

02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:36.840
Uh, Loki.

02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:41.240
So, uh, the launch of battlefield four hasn't been that great.

02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:46.840
Apparently they've had server issues like crazy and dice has been just kind of, um,

02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:48.600
trying to get things fixed.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:55.240
So to kind of help with that, um, they have halted work on everything but battlefield four.

02:08:55.240 --> 02:09:00.840
Um, so I guess that's gonna, you know, delay that mirrors edge reboot and star star was

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:01.800
bell front.

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:06.520
Um, and also the expansions for battlefield four, they want to get the game working.

02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:11.320
Um, you know, ASAP, we know we still have ways to go with fixing the game.

02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:14.280
It's that it is absolutely our number one priority.

02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:17.160
And the team at dice is working nonstop to update the game.

02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:21.800
And we know players are frustrated and we feel your pain and we will not stop until

02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:22.440
this is right.

02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:25.320
So it's good to see that they're taking charge.

02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:30.440
It's too bad that it took like, you know, a whole, you know, almost two months before,

02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:32.200
you know, they did that.

02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:32.360
Yeah.

02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:35.800
I'm not a battlefield four player myself, but I have heard there have been some issues.

02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.240
So that's, uh, yeah.

02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:40.360
And code man says there, the servers are shit on PlayStation four.

02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:42.200
EA game and servers are shit.

02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:44.120
Say it ain't.

02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:46.680
So to be fair, a lot of games have launched problems.

02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:51.160
My beloved Final Fantasy 14 Rome Reborn was kind of a shit-tacular experience the first

02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:52.520
couple of weeks because of similar issues.

02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:53.000
Couple of weeks.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.680
This game's been out for like six weeks now.

02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:56.200
No games.

02:09:56.200 --> 02:10:02.200
Well, I haven't skewed perspective because a, I actually played 1.0 and B the beta went

02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:02.840
on for so long.

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:04.520
It wasn't that I'm in, I'm in battlefield.

02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:05.080
Oh, battlefield.

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:05.400
Oh yeah.

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:05.640
Yeah.

02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:06.440
Well, yeah.

02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:08.920
No, they, they didn't get on it as fast as they should have.

02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:10.360
I agree with that.

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:11.880
All right.

02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:14.360
So anyway, uh, moving on with some other news.

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:19.560
Uh, this story is about a beloved system of mine, the Commodore 64.

02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:22.040
Yes, I have Commodore 64 news tonight.

02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:22.540
Ha.

02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:30.040
Uh, this is cool because, uh, Paul Kohler and Mikel Hastert, who did a port of super

02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:33.160
crate box, which was called super bread box.

02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:41.320
They did a port of super hexagon that is, uh, yeah, which was a more recent game, but

02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:44.920
they actually ported that to the Commodore 64.

02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:47.400
So let me actually play a little bit of this in studio.

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:51.400
Well, it doesn't really do anything at the beginning, but then when it gets into the

02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:59.320
video here a little bit, check out that sweet Commodore 64 synth music when it gets a little

02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:03.160
further here in the video, maybe, but you can actually play this in an emulator or you

02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:05.080
can actually play it on a regular system.

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:07.800
Nice.

02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:08.600
I'm rocking out.

02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.320
I know what I'm going to play this week.

02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:13.480
Props to you guys for doing this.

02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:15.560
This looks great for a Commodore 64 game.

02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:21.720
I wonder if Terry Cavanaugh likes the Commodore 64, considering that these two last titles

02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:26.280
have been Commodore 64 looking games for those who did not know.

02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:33.240
I think a lot of people, I think a lot of people were influenced by the Commodore 64.

02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:39.560
That was actually, uh, I, with the exception of educational games and maybe one or two

02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:42.600
other random things like that, which I talked about three weeks ago.

02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:48.840
Um, I, I never owned a Commodore 64, so I'm pretty distanced from like tape loading and

02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:52.680
actually understanding its extended basic that you have to use and all that kind of

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:53.480
stuff.

02:11:53.480 --> 02:12:01.160
But I loved the games I played on Commodore 64, uh, Space Taxi, um, Beachhead.

02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:05.880
Some, I want to say it was Top Gun, but it was something Dogfight like.

02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:10.680
And then this, I used to play the hell out of this game and it was by the makers of Beachhead.

02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:12.760
I need to do a let's remember video for this plug plug.

02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:13.880
Maybe I'll do that this week.

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:15.240
It's a good week for YouTube.

02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:15.480
Yeah.

02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:19.080
This, uh, it was by the makers of Beachhead.

02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:19.640
They did a game.

02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:24.120
This is kind of, it's kind of wrong if you think about it, but it was definitely a relic

02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:24.840
of the eighties.

02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:27.160
It was a game called Raid Over Moscow.

02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:27.960
Do you ever play this?

02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:33.720
It was a game where like, literally there's nuclear warheads being launched out of Moscow

02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:37.640
into America and you're kind of going to stop it from happening.

02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:40.440
And it was, it's kind of controversial at the time when it came out.

02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:41.640
I don't know why.

02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:42.440
Why are we on this topic?

02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:42.680
Sorry.

02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.320
You got me on Commodore 64 kick.

02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.040
And then you said Beachhead and I was like, Oh, did you know the Beachhead makers made

02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:49.480
this game anyway?

02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:53.800
Or we could just listen to awesome Chiptune songs that were made on the Commodore 64.

02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:54.440
I'm down for that.

02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:54.680
Ooh.

02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:59.080
You know, could somebody write a new OLR theme in the Commodore 64 said chip that would be

02:12:59.080 --> 02:12:59.320
rad.

02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:00.760
Do it.

02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:01.400
I can ask.

02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:02.920
Doesn't Bobby do some of that stuff?

02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:04.200
Maybe.

02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:04.840
Maybe.

02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:05.560
All right.

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:06.360
Uh, anyhow.

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:06.840
Oh, good.

02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:10.280
I'm not the only one that remembers Dungeon Buster in chat says that's a great game.

02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:13.160
I always flew the plane into the wall.

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:15.880
The very first thing you have to do is fly the plane out of a hangar.

02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:17.400
Cause you know, you got to get a plane out there.

02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:21.560
And I always crashed it into the wall cause I was seven and awful at video games.

02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:25.320
Anyway, uh, let's move on dark soccer.

02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:25.960
What do you have for us?

02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:32.920
I'm actually, uh, we're still talking about cartoons in chat and I will freely admit that

02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:38.840
I loved vehicle Voltron because, and now I'm actually trying to find subtitled copies of

02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:40.680
die rigger 15 that it was based off of.

02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.480
So I've got all of go lion, which is fucking depressing.

02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:52.440
So this is a little bit, um, it's, it's related to video games in the terms that it uses the,

02:13:52.440 --> 02:14:01.960
um, the connect, but there is a robot called Russell that is, um, it was created by scientists,

02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:09.320
um, at, uh, looks like a Vanderbilt university in Tennessee that uses the connect sensor to work

02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:16.280
with autistic kids and basically, um, and for people who don't really understand autism very

02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:24.840
well, um, basically the biggest thing, what, you know, with just about any range of it is having

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:31.240
problems with social cues and being overwhelmed very easily by sensory information.

02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:37.240
And with looking at a human face, there's a lot of information that a person can miss,

02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:44.520
but working into understanding movements and interaction with a robot that has limited forms

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:51.560
of interaction itself has been helping a lot of these kids acclimatize better into a neurotypical

02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:52.200
society.

02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:54.600
So it's, it's pretty neat.

02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:58.920
There's a quote in here from one of the scientists behind it that says autistic children understand

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.480
the physical world much better than the social world.

02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:07.240
So since this isn't as complex as a human being, the child isn't overstimulated.

02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:13.640
But the fact that it's using the connect to sense the child's movements and react to it

02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:17.720
is, I'd have to say a pretty good application for the technology.

02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:27.800
So it's, it's nice to hear about, you know, what the technology for gaming is kind of doing

02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:31.160
for good out there, especially when there's been a lot of dog in on connect lately because,

02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:35.240
you know, it's a required part of Xbox one and there's really not a lot of games using

02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:35.640
it.

02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:39.240
So it is kind of nice to hear some of these other stories that help kind of, oh, this

02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:41.080
is, this is why this technology is awesome.

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:42.280
Exactly.

02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:50.040
And I think that in this case too, where, you know, like I said, where a human can basically

02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:58.040
give way too much information for, especially a more advanced autistic case, having a robot

02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:02.520
that's giving much limited information is a lot easier to process and better for integration.

02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:07.720
So our, our robot overlords will be kind to us.

02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:11.320
All right.

02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:13.960
Let's move on a few more stories before we get to the mailbag.

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:14.760
Loki.

02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:15.080
All right.

02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:21.640
Um, so as I mentioned in my gaming week, I did play a little bit of just cause to the

02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:22.600
multiplayer mod.

02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:28.680
It's right now they're doing their final beta test of the servers and stuff this week.

02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:36.360
And, um, it will be launching officially on steam December 16th and they haven't given

02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:37.800
a price to it yet.

02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:42.040
I don't know if it's going to be free or if it's just going to be something that, um,

02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:45.960
there's a fee to, but so far so good.

02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:47.240
And it's, it's pretty fun.

02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:50.600
So, um, look forward to that, I guess in a couple of weeks.

02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:56.840
And, uh, if you can definitely join up in the beta if they haven't, um, close out.

02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:03.400
Yeah, I think, uh, JC dash MP.com and, uh, you can sign up there and get a steam key

02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:09.160
to, um, uh, yeah, to, uh, get the, uh, latest client there.

02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:12.440
So, um, recommend you do that if you haven't already.

02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:14.600
Cause it's fun.

02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:21.800
You've talked enough about that here on this program, just your excitement for it makes

02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:22.920
me kind of want to play it.

02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:24.840
It's cause I bet I can get the game super cheap.

02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:27.800
Unlike grand theft auto five is still a little pricey.

02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:35.160
I skipped just cause one, but I like just cause two is the, is the longest adventure

02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:39.240
hunt collectible, collectible game that I've played ever.

02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:48.040
And I, and I got to, um, 94, 95, maybe 96% completion, uh, finished the story, started

02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:52.040
a second play through like this game is one that I'm actually going through completion

02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:58.440
on the frustrating part is that the game is bugged and you literally cannot reasonably,

02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:00.920
uh, get a hundred percent collection in that game.

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.080
But this sounds fucking awesome.

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:03.640
So sad.

02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:06.200
It's windows only PC only and windows only.

02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:12.520
Well, here's a game that, uh, you'll probably only be able to experience on PC only pretty

02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:16.760
soon, although not if the publishers are able to get their way at skull girls, which I know

02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:18.520
a lot of people have been talking about.

02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:21.800
Um, this game is by publisher autumn games.

02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:26.840
And, uh, here's the thing they are terminating their business deal with Konami because Konami

02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:31.880
was the ones that actually, uh, got the game distributed and got it onto the Xbox live

02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:34.760
arcade and onto the PlayStation network.

02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:38.600
Well, because they are severing their ties with Konami, Konami has asked that the games

02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:39.640
be delisted.

02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:44.520
So skull girls will be removed from the PlayStation network on December 17th and on off Xbox live

02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:47.880
arcade before the end of the year when the contract expires.

02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:54.600
Now, um, unfortunately what's happening with this whole thing is that, uh, they want to

02:18:54.600 --> 02:19:00.680
replace skull girls with a, I guess a different self published build that actually has some

02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:03.000
of the improvements that the PC update had in it.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:07.160
They're trying to get that out ASAP, but I get the sense they might've been blindsided

02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:12.120
by this a little bit, that this is going to happen so fast because, uh, the design director

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:18.200
for skull girls, Mike Zamet said, uh, that the delisting is, uh, kind of like final fantasy

02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:21.320
six is magic user casting Ultima before he dies.

02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:29.320
So, uh, it's, it is a bit of a, uh, uh, thing, but I mean, if you're going to end an agreement,

02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:31.800
these things are going to happen.

02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:35.000
So I'm not really sure what to think in this particular scenario.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:39.000
I just hope that the, uh, uh, well, I think it's good that they're going to kind of at

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.440
least make the new version a little better and they're going to bring some of the improvements

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:42.840
over.

02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:43.800
So that's pretty cool.

02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:44.920
And so they'll get that up there.

02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:50.440
They need to get it in, I guess like next week, if before PlayStation quality assurance,

02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:53.480
like closes for the holidays, if they don't want there to be a gap.

02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:57.960
But I think the reality is there's probably going to be a little bit of a gap before this

02:19:57.960 --> 02:20:03.960
game's available again, but maybe they can kind of make, um, make lemonade out of lemons

02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:07.240
or whatever the hell you want to call it by kind of using this as like another way to

02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:09.240
kind of relaunch the game and get it out there.

02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:12.920
You know, when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager.

02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:15.880
When life gives you lemons, you mix it with vodka.

02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:20.680
And then burn their house down with the lemons.

02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.840
And then squirt it in their eyes.

02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:26.360
All right.

02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:29.800
Uh, let's travel to the mailbag.

02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:33.400
Um, I, I figured, I knew ActDeft was a fan of Skullgirls by the way.

02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:35.560
ActDeft in chat says support the steam version.

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:38.040
So you do still have a way you can support this game of something.

02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:38.680
All right.

02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:39.800
I was actually tempted to get it.

02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:42.120
So yeah, yeah, it looks, it looks fun.

02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:43.880
I just, I haven't had a chance to get, grab it yet.

02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:47.240
I just had a couple of friends on my Tumblr who were super obsessed with Skullgirls.

02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:47.640
Yeah.

02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:52.200
So I know a lot more about the backstory of the game without ever having played it.

02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:53.800
So, all right, let's go to the mailbag.

02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:59.240
Every week you guys email us mailbag at orange launch trader.com

02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:02.600
is the place to send us emails and the dark soccer will go to the email bag.

02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:04.040
She's going to dive in head first.

02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:05.320
It's sticky.

02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:07.000
Gross.

02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:10.680
And she's going to see what emails are in there tonight.

02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:11.240
We have a lot tonight.

02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:11.960
Oh my God.

02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:14.600
We got one from an old school listener.

02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:14.920
Yay.

02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:16.120
I love old school listeners.

02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:16.920
Do you remember?

02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:19.880
Um, uh, I love new school ones too though for the record.

02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:21.560
Do you remember Asian buddy Paul?

02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:21.800
Yeah.

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:23.320
Hey, OLR.

02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:27.320
I was talking about gaming news at work one day and wondered how the podcast was doing.

02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:29.560
I'm glad you guys are still going very strong.

02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:30.760
And that's from Asian buddy Paul.

02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:34.440
Um, well, that literally was an email.

02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:35.160
Just saying, Hey.

02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:36.360
Hey.

02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:37.400
Sup, OLR.

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:38.040
Sup.

02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:38.680
Sup, bro.

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:40.440
Sup, bitches.

02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:43.800
Yeah, we're, we're still here.

02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:45.160
We're just a little older.

02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:45.660
Okay.

02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:47.560
This comes from Robert M.

02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:51.880
Last episode you were musing about dubstep Christmas music.

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:54.600
I got a sample music track a year ago.

02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:56.520
The capital King's version of Carol of the Bells.

02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:58.440
Easily one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.

02:21:58.440 --> 02:21:59.160
I have heard that.

02:21:59.160 --> 02:21:59.640
And in fact,

02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:02.120
Pause for Rob to look it up on YouTube and play a podcast.

02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:02.600
Oh my God.

02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:03.640
That's exactly what I was doing.

02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:05.480
And for Jamie's ears to recover.

02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:07.320
They have that actually at this.

02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:12.280
There's a court nearby that, um, decorates lights in all their houses.

02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:14.680
And they have one guy that has that synced up to music.

02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:15.800
That song actually.

02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:17.000
It's pretty awesome.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.560
I think I saw this in a YouTube ad of all things.

02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:21.560
Just in the last couple of days.

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:22.360
Oh, silly.

02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:22.840
You too.

02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:24.280
All right.

02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:26.600
Well, let me get, let me get to it.

02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:27.400
All right, here we go.

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:29.160
I'll skip ahead a little bit in the song here.

02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:34.360
This doesn't sound anything too crazy.

02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:35.480
Let me skip a little further.

02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:52.600
That should be right there.

02:22:53.240 --> 02:22:56.760
That's that's what I want to record on all of my, you know, Christmas cards.

02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:59.400
Now they have the audio Christmas cards and stuff like that right there.

02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:00.600
Merry Christmas.

02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:02.360
And it drops right there.

02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:05.560
Okay.

02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:06.520
Maybe it wasn't that one.

02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:09.320
He had actually a really cool Christmas song that was dubstep.

02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:10.840
But I don't, I don't think it was that.

02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:11.960
That wasn't very good.

02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:13.000
Wow.

02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:17.560
Okay.

02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:21.800
Which brings me to this most likely non-video game question.

02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:27.080
Is there Christmas music you enjoy any time of the year regardless of your own traditions?

02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:30.200
For me, it's the Sonic Santa Claus and They Might Be Giants cover,

02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:33.560
Nutcracker, uh, Tchaikovsky, Nutcracker Suite,

02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:37.480
and of course Vince Guiardi's A Charlie Brown Christmas Soundtrack.

02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:38.920
Keep up the great show.

02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:43.000
Um, no, I hate Christmas music to be honest.

02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:44.520
I really do.

02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:45.320
I never liked it.

02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:48.360
Except like Bing Crosby.

02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:49.240
I love the crooners.

02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:51.000
I get a little bit annoyed with it.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.600
It's not that I really hate Christmas music.

02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:53.640
It just goes on too long.

02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:55.000
Like Christmas music should be like-

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:56.600
I'm tired of Mariah Carey.

02:23:56.600 --> 02:23:58.040
The week of Christmas.

02:23:58.840 --> 02:23:59.320
That's it.

02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:03.160
Not December 1st and certainly not the day after Halloween.

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:04.600
The week of Christmas.

02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:05.160
That's enough.

02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:08.920
I've got a kind of a weird one that I like.

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:14.280
Um, I actually like, um, the soundtrack to Toys.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:15.480
Yes.

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:17.800
Toys had a really good soundtrack, but I mean-

02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:21.080
They had like, it's not really Christmas, but I mean Christmas themes.

02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:24.280
It was, it was light and fluffy and airy for some of them.

02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:25.720
But they had like, there was that one song-

02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:26.840
It was Tori Amos too.

02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:29.320
Yeah, it was a couple tracks.

02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:34.200
It was the one, um, the one that they had like the choir of kids singing or something like that.

02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:35.400
That one's like pretty cool.

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:36.920
And Hans Zimmer.

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:38.200
I mean Hans Zimmer is fucking awesome.

02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:38.840
What can you say?

02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:41.000
For the record, there is a Hanukkah song.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
There's actually a couple of Hanukkah songs I will listen to.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:49.160
And one of them is the Maccabeats music rewrite for Candlelight.

02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:52.920
And I will listen to Miracle because I freaking just love Matsus Yahoo anyway.

02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:53.800
He's awesome.

02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:54.520
Holy shit.

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:57.160
I didn't realize there were so many great artists on this.

02:24:57.160 --> 02:24:58.840
They had Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.440
I didn't even fucking know he was on that.

02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:01.480
That's pretty sweet.

02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:03.720
Hans Zimmer.

02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:09.320
I will have you know, I am getting lectured in a private message by Shane Alinko about

02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:12.280
dissing Christmas music apparently, which I just did.

02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:16.200
Shane Alinko, by the way, bought Skylanders on the PlayStation 4 this week just so he

02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:18.040
could get his Christmas Skylanders character.

02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:19.160
Just saying.

02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:20.760
That boy is obsessed with Christmas.

02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:24.200
I've just been ignoring all my villagers talking about Jingle.

02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:27.720
You know, they just I'm writing down what presents they want for Toy Day.

02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:33.240
You know, they they are selling that Skylander character separately in a couple of weeks,

02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:33.740
by the way.

02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.800
And Ikuma JP says, Oh, my God, in Japan, all Mariah Carey, all the way.

02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:41.320
I hate shops that play that song.

02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:42.600
Yes.

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:44.200
Kmart has been playing it on repeat.

02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:47.160
And the only reason I'm going to Kmart is because it's right around the corner from

02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:47.960
my freaking house.

02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:50.200
And they were the only place that had long underwear.

02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:57.400
There was another one by Boy George that that's a big favorite in Japan, too.

02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:00.920
There's there is a Christmas trick I will listen to.

02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:04.600
It was Pet Shop Boys all over the world.

02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:06.300
Christmas.

02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:09.320
Rob, you need to find that for me because I will listen to that one.

02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:12.280
No, no more Christmas music.

02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:12.840
What's next?

02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:17.080
Um, kind of long email from AZHP.

02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:17.800
I'll go ahead and read it.

02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:19.720
He writes good stuff.

02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:24.040
Hey, OLR crew, maybe I should like channel my mother and use the accent.

02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:26.040
No, just read the email.

02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:27.320
AZHP here.

02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:31.240
I just listened to that bit at the top of this week's show where listener wrote in saying

02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:34.600
you guys shouldn't be biased towards Sony or or against Xbox.

02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:36.920
I think that's a lot of crap.

02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.640
Anyone who has been listening to this show for any length of time knows you guys want

02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:43.400
every console to succeed.

02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:46.520
It would be great if every console launched issue free.

02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:52.280
Um, had great games that you were dying to play and were controversy free.

02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:55.880
But the problem is that's not the case.

02:26:55.880 --> 02:26:59.960
And when passionate people like yourselves feel that a company you believed in isn't

02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:03.240
delivering what you feel they're capable of, you respond passionately.

02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:06.280
Loki has like four Xbox 360s.

02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:08.840
He plays GTA 4 every day on one.

02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:12.760
So why shouldn't he be upset that Microsoft borked the Xbox One launch?

02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:17.800
It would be more surprising if he wasn't upset about it because he feels so passionately

02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:18.840
about the company.

02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:20.040
We hate because we love.

02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:27.000
If we take it all back to the very beginnings of OLR, Konami practically could do no wrong

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.280
by us even if they never launched a better version of DDR in USA than Konami X on PS1

02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:34.200
and DDR USA in the arcades.

02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:38.680
That didn't stop you guys from rousing them for their disc DLC and DDR universe.

02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:41.880
You guys imported Japanese PS2s to play DDR and 2DX.

02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:46.600
That didn't stop you from saying that Kuraragi eats crayons for about two years after the

02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:47.960
PS3 launched.

02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:50.040
And let's not forget Nintendo.

02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:53.720
As much as you guys love each Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, and Zelda game that comes out,

02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:58.120
Nintendo's failure to understand online has always been a pain point that you go back

02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:03.240
to again and again ever since the DS and Wii launched with friends codes and no usable

02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:04.120
friends interface.

02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:06.940
Hold on.

02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:10.360
We, again, we hate because we love.

02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:14.280
Everyone's a little bit biased, but we're biased because we know what we want in our

02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:17.240
hearts, and when we get it, we're happy.

02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:20.440
But when we don't get it, we're unhappy.

02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:21.560
Thanks for reading my email.

02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:25.320
As someone who has listened to this show on and off since its beginnings, I couldn't

02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:29.080
sit by and watch someone leave the show just because you guys were, quote, biased.

02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:30.200
Everyone's biased.

02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:31.640
That's where our opinions come from.

02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:32.200
Deal with it.

02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:35.400
Yours truly is HP, OLR's premier gold star recipient.

02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:43.480
Uh, thank you for remembering more than I do about the history of the show and some

02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:44.760
of the things we said.

02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:48.200
But my one little thing is that I think that the beginning of the email said something

02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:52.040
like, well, I think that's crap or whatever, but let's not forget, you know, we got to

02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:53.800
respect everybody's opinions or whatever.

02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:57.640
And I would just hate for the person who is just trying to give honest feedback last week

02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:01.560
to feel like, you know, like now everybody's picking on somebody for their opinion.

02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:02.360
No, I know.

02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:04.680
And I just want to make sure it's very clear their opinion.

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:05.400
Absolutely.

02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:05.880
Absolutely.

02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:07.720
Everybody's entitled to their opinion, period.

02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:10.280
I just want to make that explicitly clear.

02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:10.920
So thank you.

02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:13.800
We can go to the next email now though.

02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:14.040
All right.

02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:16.600
Well, I'm asking permission if I can thank somebody on air.

02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:17.240
Oh, okay.

02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:18.760
Someone just did something super nice for me.

02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:20.920
So go ahead and read this email.

02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:23.400
Last week's opening was very thought provoking.

02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.800
I don't think that OLR is centric to any specific console or platform.

02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:32.760
I do think that many of the viewpoints we hear on OLR are representative of the core

02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:37.560
gaming community, though not necessarily representative of the more ambiguous and

02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:39.320
generic gaming umbrella.

02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:43.480
The PS4 offers little to no change from what gamers have largely grown accustomed to.

02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:48.040
It doesn't threaten the status quo and I think that it is very appealing to core gamers.

02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:52.920
I can add to a large, I can to a large extent understand why the IR against Xbox ones is

02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:56.360
so pervasive on gaming sites, forums, and podcasts.

02:29:56.360 --> 02:30:01.880
Anecdotally, people who spend no time on these types of sites don't share a similar attitude.

02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:06.040
By the way, this is written very well with great grammar, although I do miss the Oxford

02:30:06.040 --> 02:30:06.360
comma.

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:16.680
As gamers, I find that our community often, and perhaps the internet in general, loves

02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:18.920
to revel in negative news.

02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:22.520
To that end, I can agree with the poster that it can be depressing to be inundated with

02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:25.720
a wet blanket attitude even in the midst of a console launch.

02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:29.400
A very rare and exciting time in my opinion.

02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:32.680
I am not suggesting that we should ignore the negativity and also lay down a magical

02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:34.120
rainbow while holding hands.

02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:35.320
Dude, that sounds fun.

02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:36.680
Only if there's sheet cake involved.

02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:41.560
What I am saying is that we also sit back and smile once in a while with the amazing

02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:46.600
choices we have as gamers on nearly every platform and at a variety of entry points

02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:47.640
and simply marvel.

02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:52.440
Every time I even think about getting bitter, my son reminds me how much he loves Mario

02:30:52.440 --> 02:30:57.080
Cat, Super Mario 3D Land, and how he wants a Pokemon party for his next birthday and

02:30:57.080 --> 02:30:59.960
I realize that gaming is still as great as we want it to be.

02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:02.040
Hugs and kisses to OLR, Dark Charger.

02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:03.400
This is an exciting time.

02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:07.320
I agree with that in the email is that, you know, despite all the wars and disagreements

02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:09.800
sometimes, this is a very exciting time to be a gamer.

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:14.200
If you think about it next year, just to put this in perspective, we're almost to 2014,

02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:14.440
right?

02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:19.880
Next year will mark the 12th year of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.

02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:25.560
In the 12 years that we've been doing the show, you've had two consoles releasing in

02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:31.160
the same month twice and one of them was this month or this past month, November.

02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:34.360
The other time was when the PlayStation 3 and the Wii launched in the same month back

02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:40.440
in 2006, which would have been like the second year of the podcast form of the show after

02:31:40.440 --> 02:31:42.920
we made the switch from the DDR stuff.

02:31:42.920 --> 02:31:44.920
So, I mean, it is an exciting time.

02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:47.080
Moments like this don't come around very often.

02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:52.680
And I think from E3, this whole conversation has been very charged.

02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:57.480
What was very different about last time is that when it was Sony and Nintendo launching

02:31:57.480 --> 02:32:02.040
in the same month, you know, everybody was hazing Sony because, oh, Sony's looking like

02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:03.880
a bunch of crayon eaters right now.

02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:05.880
And wow, Nintendo's kind of doing something different.

02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:09.960
I mean, that was the mindset of the internet, quote unquote, back then.

02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:15.640
Now, I mean, sure, you've got your Xbox and your Sony fanboys and Gran and Microsoft made

02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:18.040
a lot of missteps at E3.

02:32:18.040 --> 02:32:23.640
But what really was different this time was Sony calling them out.

02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:26.280
That was a key difference.

02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:30.680
And that's caused there to be a little more sting in this whole war.

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:37.080
I think you can trace that back to that very moment when Sony made the YouTube of how to

02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:41.160
play used games on the PlayStation 4, where one dude handed the game to the other.

02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:47.160
I mean, I know we're not quite to the point where we look at back on the biggest news

02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:51.080
stories of the year, but I would say the release of that YouTube was the biggest news

02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:52.360
story of 2013.

02:32:52.360 --> 02:32:55.880
I'll probably end up saying that again at the end of the year was when Sony themselves

02:32:55.880 --> 02:33:00.280
put out a video of how to trade a used game on the PlayStation 4, because that was just

02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:05.320
that you didn't see that last gen, that kind of slapping, basically.

02:33:05.320 --> 02:33:07.080
Anyhow, DarkSaga.

02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:10.440
I am defending my love of Digimon 02.

02:33:11.880 --> 02:33:12.440
Random.

02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:13.800
But only the Japanese version.

02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:15.000
I really liked that one.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:15.960
The movies were great.

02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:21.160
Anyway, this one comes from Ye Olde Reginator.

02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:25.080
Hi, oh, you know, by the way, you know how that began the Ye Olde thing?

02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:26.920
Typography.

02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:31.640
There used to be a letter that they did not have a type for, and it looked very similar

02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:33.400
to the Y, so they used that.

02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:35.160
And that's why we have Ye Olde and not The Olde.

02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:36.680
Let's get to Ye Olde next email.

02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:37.560
Hi, OLR crew.

02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:38.840
It's Reginator again.

02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:41.480
I just thought I'd post some random questions this week.

02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:45.720
One, I've noticed that as of the PS2 Xbox GameCube generation of consoles, unlike

02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:49.960
previous generations, console generation stopped being referred to as being the insert

02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:52.200
number here bit console or generation.

02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:53.400
Why the drop in the practice?

02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:58.440
It seems to me that the practice is a quick, easy, and easily understandable way to refer

02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:02.920
to a generation of consoles, rather than going the long-winded route of saying something

02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:05.400
like the 360 slash PS3 slash Wii generation.

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:11.480
Number two, with Steam's Winter Sale presumably starting within the next few days, what games

02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:15.560
do the three of you think should be on everyone's radar and should be bought if it

02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:16.280
goes on sale?

02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:23.320
Well, there was a game on my list, but Codeman got it for me.

02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:23.640
Oh.

02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:25.560
So I'm going to be playing Skullgirls when I get home.

02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:26.520
Oh, nice.

02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:27.080
Lucky you.

02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:27.560
That's great.

02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:28.280
Lucky me.

02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:28.680
Thank you.

02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:29.000
Thank you.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.040
He's a nice boy.

02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:30.600
He is.

02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:37.320
To be fair, I gave him a little gift on behalf of the show earlier this week.

02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:39.960
So I'm glad to see he's paying it forward.

02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:40.760
That's very kind.

02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:44.280
What else was I going to say with that?

02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:47.160
So what Steam games should Rage Nator be on the lookout for?

02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:48.760
Is that basically the gist of what I'm hearing?

02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:51.160
Well, what we are on the lookout for, I guess.

02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:54.600
I'm probably going to get Final Fantasy 13 because it should be out by then.

02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:56.040
On PC?

02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:56.600
Yeah.

02:34:56.600 --> 02:34:58.360
They were saying that there should be a PC release.

02:34:58.360 --> 02:34:59.320
I didn't know they were doing a PC release.

02:34:59.320 --> 02:34:59.720
I thought there was.

02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:00.200
Are you sure?

02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:01.560
I think I read it somewhere.

02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:03.560
I think it would have been out by now if that was the case.

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:06.600
Okay, well then Dan's the one that told me about it, so.

02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:08.520
What have I been keeping my eye on?

02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:12.120
I ended up buying Stanley Parable was something I was going to get, and I did get that.

02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:13.400
Gone Home I ended up getting.

02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:14.920
Spelunky I ended up getting.

02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:19.240
Like all the games I had on my watch list, I ended up getting this past sale.

02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:25.160
If Final Fantasy 8 goes on sale, I will buy it for the sole purpose of giving it another chance,

02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:30.120
especially with this thing that Loki was talking about where he can fix the magic system and only

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:32.920
have to draw once, even if it's cheating, quote unquote.

02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:37.800
I think that's how I played through the game now that I think about it.

02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:39.560
I'll probably get it too if it goes on sale.

02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:40.680
Yeah, that's one I'd be looking forward to.

02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:45.560
I don't know why I, you know what, I did look this up, and it wasn't 13,

02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:48.920
but Dan had mentioned something to me, and I think I had it stuck in my head.

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:52.360
But I almost picked it up for Xbox, but.

02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:59.080
I'm trying to, I'm actually loading up Steam right now to see if there's anything that

02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:02.200
jumps out of my mind as like something I was waiting on to get.

02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:04.280
Officially released Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:08.040
It's not on Steam, but Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:11.240
Hotline Miami is on sale right now, which I have and is fun.

02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:13.160
I think I got that in an indie bundle.

02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:15.720
I completely forgot for that for my gaming week.

02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:17.560
I actually started playing Hotline Miami.

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:19.960
I forgot my gaming week.

02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:22.520
Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed was free this weekend on Steam,

02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:24.120
and I played that too because it was free.

02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:24.620
Yeah.

02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:26.840
So it's on sale right now too.

02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:30.440
Honestly, Ragenator, I think everything I wanted, I really bought in this last sale.

02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:33.480
I'm sure there will be more indie games that I see little screenshots of,

02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:34.600
and I'll be like, Ooh, I want that.

02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:35.320
Ooh, I want that.

02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:39.560
There are a couple that appealed to me, but I think for right now,

02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.320
like that Ringrunner one actually looked interesting.

02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:47.560
But for right now, I still have the Shiva to play.

02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:49.560
I have now I have Skullgirls to play.

02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:50.920
I have Deadpool to play.

02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:51.720
Yeah.

02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:54.840
So you're probably never going to see me on Final Fantasy again,

02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:56.200
because I don't know if there's shit to play.

02:36:57.880 --> 02:37:00.440
But then patch 2.1 will hit and it'll be like, Ooh.

02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:05.160
I need to just freaking get past level 31 so that I can do that stupid

02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:09.560
quest that I'm stuck on, my Arkanis job quest.

02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:11.080
Anyway, whatever.

02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:14.920
Three, Final Fantasy VIII's recent release on Steam.

02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:17.320
Yay, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, meh.

02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:19.240
Or Final Fantasy VIII, fuck that shit.

02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:21.320
I think we just answered that question.

02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:25.800
I don't, I mean, I realized there was a little bit of a Twitter debate

02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.960
earlier this week that I got caught up in, and I kind of started it, so I deserve it.

02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:34.680
But I don't despise Final Fantasy VIII by many means.

02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:39.720
I just feel a few key flaws in that game really ruin the fun.

02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:44.360
And so I don't remember it as fondly as the others, but it has a good story.

02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:48.520
I mean, you know, it's, and it was especially considering you could have

02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:52.360
made a game that was very similar to VII when VII did so well, but they didn't.

02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:54.360
And they went a very different direction with the story.

02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:55.960
And I do applaud them for that.

02:37:55.960 --> 02:38:01.560
So I'm trying to be nice y'all, but it's, it's still the worst Final

02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:03.480
Fantasy game next to 14, 1.0.

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:04.200
I'm sorry.

02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:05.000
It's just how I feel.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:05.400
Opinions.

02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:05.880
I have them.

02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:10.120
By the way, they did bring up the Tamagotchi and handheld Digimon.

02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:13.480
They were both brought out by Bandai, which the Tamagotchi came out first.

02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:15.080
Then Digimon came so that you could battle.

02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:22.360
I had the little ones, the handheld LED, or not LED, but LCD Digimon battler things.

02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:27.720
And then I was like, I think I remembered naming my, because I evolved to Devimon first.

02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:29.400
And I remember calling him Satan Common.

02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:31.560
That was his name.

02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:33.080
And I was, thought I would name a dog that.

02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:37.960
For, I'm thinking of establishing a weekly Vognite on Counter-Strike Global Offensive

02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:39.000
on Steam.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.480
I know that unlike TF2, it isn't free, but it will likely be on sale soon.

02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:48.120
Would, would, would be, there are any takers?

02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:55.480
It was actually just on sale recently and I did pick it up, because it means that I

02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:59.080
have pretty much the entirety of the, the first party Valve pack.

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:02.120
I have literally everything they have ever released first party.

02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:04.920
Mine is Left 4 Dead, one and two.

02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:07.080
So nevermind.

02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:09.080
This email is brought to you by Star Fox 64.

02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:09.800
Do a barrel roll.

02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:15.800
And last email, which by the way, we did have one from YYR, but I.

02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:16.760
He said he'd call later.

02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:18.600
I have paid attention to the chat.

02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:19.000
Yes.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.640
And I'm honoring the previous statement.

02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:22.200
All right.

02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:23.160
Live is better.

02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:24.360
Hi, O.L.R. Crew.

02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:25.080
I said hi.

02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:27.400
Firstly, that's what it says here.

02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:31.000
Firstly, thank you all for giving me a theme song.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:36.360
Sky made a great choice with conga feeling, though I'm waiting for the day he screws

02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:39.000
up and plays Miami Sound Machines conga by accident.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:41.960
Wait, I got a better one.

02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:42.920
I got an even better one.

02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:43.640
Give it a minute.

02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:44.280
Keep, keep going.

02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:45.560
I'll play a theme song here at the end.

02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:47.880
But enough about you guys.

02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:49.320
I'm here to ask your pal Jason.

02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:54.440
One, since Jason is now doing intros, is he being paid in peanuts or Oreos?

02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:55.560
I did give him a candy cane.

02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:57.800
He drinks some of our juice.

02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:03.320
He's being paid in love and high fives.

02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:09.960
I am being paid in involvement, which has been it's what it's legitimately wonderful

02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:10.440
to do.

02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:16.760
We said, Jason, if you'll help us out, we will give you what we get from doing the show.

02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:17.480
We will match.

02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:21.080
I get an equal share of what we get.

02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:21.800
That's what he gets.

02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:26.520
Okay, back to the email.

02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:30.120
Has Jason introduced OLR to the Game Grumps web show?

02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:31.640
I've heard of it.

02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:34.120
I know of Game Grumps.

02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:38.360
I know I have name dropped it and similar channels that I follow once or twice.

02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:40.440
And I'm pretty sure I've even worn a shirt out here.

02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:46.760
And not, not that I of course have any, I don't, I don't have any connection to any

02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:52.280
of these other shows except as a fan, but I do have some ideas of things that I think

02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:54.920
could be kind of pretty fantastic.

02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:58.200
But we'll see if I can actually get in touch with people and make things happen.

02:40:58.200 --> 02:40:58.440
Okay.

02:40:58.440 --> 02:40:59.800
I'm like, I don't want to rip anything off.

02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:00.280
Certainly.

02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:01.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:06.680
Certainly like no, no promises to speak of, but I consume a hell of a lot of content and

02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:10.360
you know, so many of these things take place in California anyway.

02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:14.280
So it's a little bit more doable and not just something by Skype.

02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:15.320
I have ideas.

02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:21.320
Well, Hey, since we're on the topic, um, what video shows do you like other than Game Grumps?

02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:23.560
Um, I like, I like Game Sack.

02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:28.840
Another one of my sources for news, like the first couple of times I did the intro is that,

02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:30.920
um, she goes by Dodger.

02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:32.360
She has two different channels.

02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:36.040
Uh, her gaming channel all the time is Press Heart to Continue.

02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:41.400
And she does a news show on Saturday nights that I usually try to follow to take in more

02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:42.440
content as well.

02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:47.400
Uh, the Polaris Network, just in general, I drop in, see whatever videos catch my eye

02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:50.200
and then, and then, you know, move on to something else.

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:53.400
Um, Game Grumps, uh, uh, uh, crap.

02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:54.360
What's his name?

02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:55.000
Gerard.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.440
Uh, JK completes it.

02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:59.000
Um, Markiplier.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.880
I've been watching quite a, quite a lot of his stuff lately.

02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:10.200
And I feel like, Oh, Continue show, um, does, uh, it not, not a let's play, not a review,

02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:15.720
but Hey, let's play a game and publish a video of the Memorial moments.

02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:19.640
30, 30 minutes or so of a game, uh, updates every Wednesday.

02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:23.400
They've been there in, uh, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, uh, and they're pretty fun to

02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:23.880
watch too.

02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:26.920
So most of the stuff I like are the review ones, like classic game room.

02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:29.320
And, uh, I really like Game Sack.

02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:31.720
They're a newer one and game theory.

02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:32.840
I don't watch anything.

02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:33.640
I don't, I really don't.

02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:36.600
I actually, I actually do not watch review things.

02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:38.760
I watch like active content things.

02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:45.320
Every single person that I just named does plays a game and either voiceover afterwards

02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:47.640
or running commentary while they're playing the game.

02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:52.040
And I just want to clarify, like, I just, I support indie broadcasting and people, you

02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:54.440
know, doing it, but it's just like, I'm too busy.

02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:58.280
I like to do watch the stuff my friends do because a lot of my friends are doing live

02:42:58.280 --> 02:42:58.520
streaming.

02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:04.040
So I do a lot of that and I'm too busy producing, but to be honest, I think I honestly, I think

02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:05.480
of my favorites right now.

02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:11.080
I'd really have to go for game theory because I like the fact that it breaks apart and analyzes.

02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:15.320
I did just catch that the other day because link dead one.

02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:19.160
No, uh, uh, Mario, uh, Mario's affliction.

02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:23.080
I can't remember the name, but basically the fact that he's actually kind of the antihero

02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:26.280
in like the, the legitimate lore and everything in my universe.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.240
So anyway, um, to go ahead and close up this email, since that was the last thing that's

02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:31.480
it.

02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:32.040
Have a good night.

02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:32.920
The nasty canasta.

02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:35.480
Oh, and here for nasty canasta.

02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:43.480
This is Conga for BeatMania 2DX4 style by Good Cool.

02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:46.680
Yeah, I told you I have something better.

02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:48.040
This one's fun to play too.

02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:49.080
Nasty canasta.

02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:51.080
All right.

02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:52.120
Anyhow.

02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:52.920
Ha.

02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:54.760
See, I'm not the only one that likes game theory.

02:43:55.400 --> 02:44:00.440
I tried it one time while back to mix conga and conga feeling together.

02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:01.160
It doesn't work.

02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:01.880
It doesn't work.

02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:02.600
It doesn't work.

02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:03.880
I miss your remixes, Loki.

02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:06.200
All right.

02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:07.000
Is that it for emails?

02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:07.880
Yes.

02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:08.760
Oh, well then there you go.

02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:10.600
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com.

02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:12.520
Now he's busy with genetic mixes.

02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:17.480
Is the place to mailbag at orangelauntrader.com is the place to send emails.

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:18.760
That would be fantastic.

02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:24.520
In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week because, you know, we're angsty

02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:25.160
some of the time.

02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:26.440
A lot of the time.

02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:27.800
All the time.

02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:49.160
So I have to do a little bit of a story and then, um, I will say a big FU to this jerkface.

02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:53.880
I was going to target and some people on my Facebook and Tumblr know about this.

02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:57.960
So I was going to target and there's this big guy just smoking in front of the door,

02:44:57.960 --> 02:44:58.840
blocking the path.

02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:01.480
And I was like, eh.

02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:04.840
So I tried to walk around him and he kept putting himself in my way.

02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:07.560
So I just scooted on around cause I'm shorter and faster.

02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:10.600
And he tried to grab my arm going into the target.

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:12.040
And I mean, this guy's bigger than Dan.

02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:15.400
I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm about to go off.

02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:16.360
So finish your story.

02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:20.280
Well, and he speaks in this whiskey voice, you know, the whiskey chain smoker voice.

02:45:20.280 --> 02:45:25.800
And then, so he tries to grab my arm and I pulled back and I said, I meant to say Neanderthal

02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:29.880
and I called him Neolithic, but I said, don't touch me, you Neolithic sack of shit.

02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:36.840
Because I was by that point angry because someone trying to grab me is illegal.

02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:41.160
Apart from that, it's something that sets me off immediately.

02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:42.280
Who, who does that?

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:44.360
This is not high school.

02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:45.240
This is not a bully.

02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:46.520
This is an adult.

02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:50.360
You don't grab somebody at random outside of target.

02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:56.200
To quote my friend who I discussed this with, she's like, he's the type of person who thinks

02:45:56.200 --> 02:45:57.160
that women are property.

02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:00.760
It's, it's, it's disgusting.

02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:06.440
So just going into this, basically what happens that by the time I got inside the building,

02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:09.640
after I said this to him, I just kept dashing back on into the building.

02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:12.200
He is going to get maced and good.

02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:15.480
He is going to, he's going to grab the wrong person and he is going to be maced.

02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:18.040
Well, I'm going to tell you just knowing the way that I react to things.

02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:24.600
Had he touched me, I probably would have completely lost my shit because I, without going into

02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:30.520
too much detail about my own past, I have lost my shit before when someone grabbed me

02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:32.440
and it didn't end pretty anyway.

02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:33.080
Oh, sorry.

02:46:33.080 --> 02:46:34.920
I didn't loop the FU is okay.

02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:39.880
So, so I was too busy being, and I'm short enough and he's tall enough that if I had,

02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:40.280
I punched him.

02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:41.160
I would have punched him in the deck.

02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:46.120
So anyway, so I, I scooted inside target and he's yelling after me.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:48.120
Come back here, midget.

02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:53.560
But that's all he could say.

02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:57.960
And I was like, and it just, I, cause I was so angry and so worked up.

02:46:57.960 --> 02:46:59.560
I would have called the police.

02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:03.960
Actually, if I had been with you, I, Oh, it would have gone down as a target parking lot.

02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:06.360
Well, I, let's put it this way.

02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:12.360
I was, I was so worked up and so angry and so fucking close to a full-blown meltdown

02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:15.480
that I let it out the only way I could think of, which was hysterical laughter.

02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:18.040
Just laughing my ass off.

02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:20.760
And this guy outside of here, he goes, man, she's laughing at you.

02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:23.000
And he's like, come back here midget are you laughing at me?

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:26.920
I was like, that's better is almost better than the physical punching in the deck because

02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:29.480
I publicly, you know, humiliated him.

02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:30.440
And that was pretty funny too.

02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:34.520
So, um, so, and thank you, Alan.

02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:35.000
I love you.

02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:37.800
You said, um, it's because dark soccer had the ball to be a woman in public.

02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:44.920
So basically once I calmed down and had a fun conversation with the lady in the sock department

02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:47.880
and you know how she's like, yeah, I saw him out there.

02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:50.680
I tried to teach my son never to be like that.

02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:52.040
And I was like, bless you.

02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:55.720
You know, and they ended up escorting the guys off the property.

02:47:55.720 --> 02:48:00.200
And I think they did the cops, but I stayed inside the Walmart, not Walmart, the target

02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:02.360
for a solid hour.

02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:05.640
And you know, what was even worse about that is that the Hanukkah stuff wasn't on sale yet.

02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:12.760
So anyway, so I just ended up just wandering around and looking at stuff and looking at

02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:17.320
toys and playing on the internet on my phone and finally left.

02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:22.040
And though I have to say that leaving the place is like that sort of, there's like a

02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:26.760
layer of calm that comes when you're in that heightened state where you observe everything

02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:29.400
and nothing escapes attention.

02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:31.880
I've gotten in my car and the freak out started happening.

02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:35.160
And by the time I got home, I was in full blown freak out mode.

02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:37.560
I could barely say anything to anybody.

02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:39.640
And even the cat wouldn't come near me.

02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:41.560
And when Dan came home, I just lost my shit.

02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:49.320
So, but in that situation, no, fuck him and fuck every man like him in the universe.

02:48:49.320 --> 02:48:50.520
This is why we need feminism.

02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:53.240
Moving on Loki.

02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:54.680
All right.

02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:55.880
Well, I only have one.

02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:59.720
That's the fact I have to get my wisdom teeth out.

02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:00.920
Damn it.

02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:02.920
I thought I was determined to be wise.

02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:10.120
I don't really have a lot to F you.

02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:13.480
So F you to my snacking habit is out of control.

02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:15.480
Do you like your candy cane?

02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:15.960
I did.

02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:19.240
I ate the whole damn thing because I have a habit.

02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:19.880
I love food.

02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:24.760
Jason, I had one sometime this week, but I had a really good week.

02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:25.560
I'm not angsty.

02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:28.920
F you to Jason for not having angst.

02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:30.040
All right.

02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:35.720
Uh, just a couple of just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line

02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:40.040
at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:41.240
Let's try to run through these quick.

02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:41.800
All right.

02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:48.360
So Tari, maybe on the back or coming back, uh, they have finally, um, received court

02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:50.680
approval to come out of bankruptcy.

02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:57.320
Um, they, I guess they have a payment plan now that involves a payback at 3.8 million

02:49:57.320 --> 02:49:59.560
owned to the bankruptcy lender.

02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:04.280
And, uh, once they have that and they're operating on their own, they can start paying, I guess,

02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:10.760
1.75 million to, um, you know, different creditors over the course of three years.

02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:16.680
And, uh, apparently that's a small portion of the over 10 million that they're owned.

02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:19.080
Um, but Hey, that'd be good.

02:50:19.080 --> 02:50:22.680
Cause, uh, at least it's not a studio, another studio going under.

02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:26.840
Maybe they'll make another aluminum, the dark game.

02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:28.040
Oh, it's a this crap.

02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:31.160
All right.

02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:33.000
Uh, well, good luck to Atari.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:33.400
All right.

02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:35.000
Uh, one other story for you guys.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.960
And as I promised, we would do a story about pornography.

02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:42.440
And, uh, this is a story from a website that really needs to consider their ad model because

02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:43.560
it's just annoying.

02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:46.200
And, uh, this is why people get ad blockers destructoid.

02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:52.120
But anyway, destructoid ran this story about, uh, what Pornhub, uh, had to say about, uh,

02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:55.080
pornography on the various consoles that are out there.

02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:59.640
And a destructoid actually called Pornhub or emailed or whatever people do to talk to

02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:00.360
each other.

02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:06.360
And, uh, the Pornhub vice president, Corey Price, I don't know what he's vice president

02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:07.480
of, I guess just porn.

02:51:07.480 --> 02:51:11.640
Uh, so the vice president of porn said, quote, Pornhub is targeting consoles for website

02:51:11.640 --> 02:51:15.240
support because that is where some of our users today prefer to access our site.

02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:18.760
And our aim is to offer a great user experience across all platforms.

02:51:19.320 --> 02:51:23.160
Now, the stuff you really want to know, where are people watching their pornography?

02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:28.440
Because you know, the PS3, the PS4, the Wii, the 360, they all can, you know, have the

02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:30.600
internet and therefore you can get porn on it.

02:51:31.160 --> 02:51:34.200
Um, yes, a Nintendo console, the Wii can get porn.

02:51:35.080 --> 02:51:41.000
Um, anyhow, so the majority of porn, Pornhub traffic comes from the PlayStation 3.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:45.560
55% of pornography comes from the PlayStation 3.

02:51:45.560 --> 02:51:53.000
Uh, the Xbox 360 accounts for 39% and the Wii, as this website calls it, a limp

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:53.320
6%.

02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:57.240
That's just because have you tried internet on the land?

02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:58.440
It's awful.

02:51:58.440 --> 02:51:59.000
So true.

02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:01.800
And technically though, it does work though.

02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:03.160
What?

02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:05.560
The internet on the way to bring up porn.

02:52:05.560 --> 02:52:06.280
It does.

02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:07.000
I remember.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:07.960
We've done that.

02:52:07.960 --> 02:52:08.600
Yes.

02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:10.600
It was research purposes, of course.

02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:13.640
Anyway, so congratulations PlayStation 3.

02:52:13.640 --> 02:52:16.200
You are the Kings and Queens of pornography.

02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:16.700
Yay.

02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:20.440
Let's go to the phones at one eight seven seven game.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.880
Or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:52:23.880 --> 02:52:24.280
Hello.

02:52:24.280 --> 02:52:25.400
You're on orange launch radio.

02:52:25.400 --> 02:52:25.880
Who's this?

02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:27.240
Am I now?

02:52:27.800 --> 02:52:28.920
This is Y Y R.

02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:29.640
Hi, you're on.

02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:31.000
Greetings and salutations.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:31.960
And I love your shirt.

02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:33.000
This is video.

02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:35.880
We're getting a video call.

02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:36.840
Are you seeing this?

02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:38.120
Did you see it zoom in?

02:52:38.120 --> 02:52:39.000
Yeah, like zoom.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:40.600
This is an Xbox call, isn't it?

02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:43.800
Yes, this is I'm calling you for my Xbox one.

02:52:43.800 --> 02:52:49.640
And now let me show you basically either one of the coolest or most creepy things that

02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:53.080
the Xbox one will do as you say, God is following you.

02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:55.320
Yes, it is following me.

02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:57.080
It will follow you around the room.

02:52:57.080 --> 02:53:00.360
It will basically like, if you walk out of view, it's going to be like confused.

02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:01.400
Oh God, where did he go?

02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:01.880
Oh my God.

02:53:01.880 --> 02:53:04.520
It's how clean that mess up off your table.

02:53:04.520 --> 02:53:06.120
It's going to zoom in on my face.

02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:06.680
Sorry.

02:53:06.680 --> 02:53:07.240
That's all right.

02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:10.600
Give me some wheat thins, bro.

02:53:13.560 --> 02:53:16.360
You cannot have my wheat thins.

02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:16.860
All right.

02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:18.780
Well, congratulations.

02:53:18.780 --> 02:53:18.940
Why?

02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:24.460
Why are you are the first, uh, Xbox one caller to the call to the show.

02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:26.060
So can I, can I troll you?

02:53:26.940 --> 02:53:27.500
I'm sorry.

02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:29.420
You have to see my messy living room.

02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:34.140
I was actually thinking about cleaning it up or this call, but that's all right.

02:53:34.140 --> 02:53:34.460
Wait, wait.

02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:35.580
Can I try something real quick?

02:53:35.580 --> 02:53:37.100
Why do I try something real quick?

02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:37.660
Okay, hold on.

02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:40.300
Xbox power down.

02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:45.420
No, by the way, it's not power down.

02:53:45.420 --> 02:53:47.660
Oh, it's turn off now.

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:48.780
Xbox turn off.

02:53:50.060 --> 02:53:51.580
Don't listen to rob Xbox.

02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:54.060
He'll deceive you every time.

02:53:54.060 --> 02:53:55.180
He'll lead you astray.

02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:56.300
All right.

02:53:56.300 --> 02:53:57.420
No, it's interesting.

02:53:57.420 --> 02:54:02.860
I actually have a feeling that it somehow can differentiate between voices in the room

02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:09.580
and voices from the speaker because my girlfriend already tried this and it didn't work out

02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:10.460
all that well.

02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:11.340
Didn't work out.

02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:14.940
So you're, uh, making Xbox one video calls to your girlfriend, huh?

02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:17.740
Uh, yes, actually what's interesting.

02:54:17.740 --> 02:54:22.060
Um, I was cleaning up my place for the last two days and listening to the last two weeks

02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:23.260
worth of OLR.

02:54:23.260 --> 02:54:25.740
And I see you mentioned that you're in San Francisco a lot.

02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:26.780
Well, guess where she lives?

02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:28.380
San Francisco.

02:54:29.020 --> 02:54:33.420
So, uh, we may, depending on what happens, we may need to make some plans to, you know,

02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:36.380
me chill out because she's actually listening right now.

02:54:36.380 --> 02:54:37.740
So she'll know who you are.

02:54:37.740 --> 02:54:39.500
Do you, oh, well, howdy.

02:54:39.500 --> 02:54:41.500
Where, where, when are you coming to San Francisco?

02:54:41.500 --> 02:54:45.180
Cause, cause our, our buddy Jason is in San Francisco for the holidays.

02:54:46.060 --> 02:54:50.780
Oh, well, I mean, I'm going to visit her for a few days on the 19th, but I'm not sticking

02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:51.660
around for very long.

02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:55.100
Cause I'm, I basically used up all of my vacation this year.

02:54:55.100 --> 02:54:55.820
Nope.

02:54:55.820 --> 02:54:57.980
Well, uh, look, look up VX chase next week.

02:54:57.980 --> 02:54:58.940
Cause he's in us.

02:54:58.940 --> 02:55:00.220
He's said Seattle.

02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:00.780
What the hell?

02:55:00.780 --> 02:55:02.220
He's in San Francisco right now.

02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:03.180
Keep in touch anyways.

02:55:03.180 --> 02:55:04.380
Let's see if we can work something out.

02:55:04.380 --> 02:55:04.780
There you go.

02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:06.620
That's cool.

02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:11.180
So I'm listening to OLR over the weekend and by the way, um, how's the audio?

02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:11.820
Is it coming through?

02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:12.300
Okay.

02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:12.780
It's good.

02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:17.660
You can tell that your, your microphone, like you're not talking into a microphone that

02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:21.180
it's like a room microphone that has a big gate, but it's, it's fine.

02:55:21.180 --> 02:55:22.060
It's, it's good enough.

02:55:22.060 --> 02:55:22.380
Okay.

02:55:22.380 --> 02:55:24.060
So I shouldn't try plugging this in.

02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:27.180
I'd be curious just to see what the quality difference is.

02:55:28.060 --> 02:55:28.300
Okay.

02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:28.940
Well, you know what?

02:55:28.940 --> 02:55:31.020
I'll plug in my, uh, a little mic here.

02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:32.940
He's plugging in a little microservices.

02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:34.140
Is there still a radio show?

02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:37.260
We might all be looking at video, but I know the podcast listeners can't see it.

02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:37.660
Okay.

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:38.780
Uh, can you hear me now?

02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:39.660
Oh, that sounds okay.

02:55:39.660 --> 02:55:41.340
That sounds like a normal call now.

02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:41.820
Yeah.

02:55:41.820 --> 02:55:43.100
I think I lost you.

02:55:43.100 --> 02:55:43.740
No, we're here.

02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:44.700
Hi, still there.

02:55:44.700 --> 02:55:45.020
Yes.

02:55:45.020 --> 02:55:45.740
You sound great.

02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:46.700
So talk.

02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:47.340
God damn it.

02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:50.140
And this become old can't became a one week.

02:55:50.140 --> 02:55:50.940
Oh my God.

02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:54.620
Yeah, that's too bad because he sounds better on that thing.

02:55:54.620 --> 02:55:59.900
I had to suppress the urge to reach out my hand and say, turn the volume up in sign language,

02:55:59.900 --> 02:56:00.940
but we don't have a camera.

02:56:00.940 --> 02:56:01.900
We don't have a cam in here.

02:56:01.900 --> 02:56:03.260
Maybe I need to go get one.

02:56:03.260 --> 02:56:03.580
What are you?

02:56:03.580 --> 02:56:08.220
He's pressing buttons and I see the lights in his room, like fluctuating, like he's

02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:09.980
running through different screens.

02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:10.300
All right.

02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:11.340
Well, I just thought plugged it.

02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:12.380
Can you hear me now?

02:56:12.380 --> 02:56:12.620
Yeah.

02:56:12.620 --> 02:56:14.940
We could actually hear you before and you sounded great.

02:56:14.940 --> 02:56:15.420
Yeah.

02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:16.060
Huh?

02:56:16.060 --> 02:56:17.500
Now he can't hear us at all.

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:18.540
You lost it entirely.

02:56:20.140 --> 02:56:21.260
This is exciting.

02:56:21.260 --> 02:56:21.900
Why?

02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:22.380
Uh, maybe.

02:56:22.380 --> 02:56:23.180
Oh, you don't know what else?

02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:23.740
Let's see.

02:56:23.740 --> 02:56:23.980
Okay.

02:56:23.980 --> 02:56:24.540
He hung up.

02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:29.820
Xbox one y'all wave of the future.

02:56:31.180 --> 02:56:31.900
He's calling back.

02:56:32.540 --> 02:56:32.780
Okay.

02:56:32.780 --> 02:56:33.900
He's calling back right now.

02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:40.140
Well, I would have to say that was absolutely a success.

02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:44.060
We can hear you fine that whole time.

02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:44.780
Just so you know.

02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:45.420
Oh, really?

02:56:45.420 --> 02:56:45.660
Yes.

02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:47.180
Yeah.

02:56:47.180 --> 02:56:50.380
Because the, yeah, I absolutely stopped hearing you.

02:56:50.380 --> 02:56:53.580
I tried unplugging the mic and I still couldn't hear you.

02:56:53.580 --> 02:56:55.660
So yeah, that didn't work out so well.

02:56:55.660 --> 02:56:58.780
Just $4.99 at your local Walmart or Target.

02:56:58.780 --> 02:57:01.020
$499 US dollars.

02:57:02.060 --> 02:57:02.860
All right.

02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:03.740
What else is on your mind?

02:57:03.740 --> 02:57:05.260
You send an email to the show, right?

02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:06.140
Yeah.

02:57:06.140 --> 02:57:10.940
Basically after listening, you know, I'm listening to a six, seven hours worth of

02:57:11.580 --> 02:57:15.100
and of course there were a few times when I'm just like, oh, I wish I was in chat so I

02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:16.700
could respond to things.

02:57:16.700 --> 02:57:19.900
But there were three things in particular that I wanted to bring up.

02:57:21.580 --> 02:57:26.220
The subject of the discontinuation of spot pass service for swap note was brought up

02:57:26.220 --> 02:57:28.300
at least four separate times.

02:57:28.300 --> 02:57:28.620
Okay.

02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:31.900
And I wanted to throw in my two cents on that.

02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:36.540
And because at first I thought also, why, why did they do that?

02:57:36.540 --> 02:57:40.140
Why couldn't they just drop the photo feature and leave the rest of it intact?

02:57:40.940 --> 02:57:47.420
But I thought about it for a while and then I understood this had to be done because swap

02:57:47.420 --> 02:57:55.660
note, unfortunately put kids and teens in touch with people who could, you know, take

02:57:55.660 --> 02:57:57.660
their pictures and do bad things with them.

02:57:58.460 --> 02:58:05.340
And if they had just dropped the photo feature, it would have left these kids and teens with

02:58:05.340 --> 02:58:07.980
a way to communicate with their potential abusers.

02:58:08.540 --> 02:58:12.540
At which point the potential abusers could just say, oh, well now send your pictures

02:58:12.540 --> 02:58:16.460
to this email address or send your pictures to this phone or things like that.

02:58:16.460 --> 02:58:23.020
It could have gone from there by completely pulling the plug that, you know, kills that

02:58:23.020 --> 02:58:23.660
idea.

02:58:23.660 --> 02:58:24.380
It stops it.

02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:30.860
My biggest problem though, YYR is that, that why are kids, how come the kids are talking

02:58:30.860 --> 02:58:33.020
to these people unsupervised in the first place?

02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:37.660
Like, you know, if, if a parent is concerned about it, why is, why is swap note even being

02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:38.780
downloaded in the first place?

02:58:38.780 --> 02:58:42.860
I think if the parents were more involved, then you wouldn't have this happen.

02:58:42.860 --> 02:58:47.900
And it, this isn't something that's, I mean, this is horrible and we do need to stop predators

02:58:47.900 --> 02:58:49.500
from predating on children.

02:58:49.500 --> 02:58:55.100
But disabled, disabling swap note is not going to do that because there's always email, there's

02:58:55.100 --> 02:58:56.380
always the internet and other forms.

02:58:56.380 --> 02:58:58.060
They found each other somehow.

02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:04.540
So I just kind of feel like, you know, well, why, I don't understand.

02:59:04.540 --> 02:59:05.660
So it strikes me as a parent.

02:59:05.660 --> 02:59:07.660
You are absolutely preaching to the choir.

02:59:07.660 --> 02:59:12.220
I completely agree with you that parents need to be more hands on about what their kids

02:59:12.220 --> 02:59:13.180
and teens are doing.

02:59:13.180 --> 02:59:17.180
But for the moments that they're not, you know, Nintendo being as family friendly as

02:59:17.180 --> 02:59:20.460
they want to be, that is what they chose to do.

02:59:20.460 --> 02:59:22.460
And I, I understand it.

02:59:22.460 --> 02:59:28.940
It sucks, but I can understand that decision because they needed to cut off the, you know,

02:59:28.940 --> 02:59:30.700
the contact between these two parties.

02:59:31.740 --> 02:59:36.220
It just, it just also further goes to show why we're never going to have video play on

02:59:36.220 --> 02:59:37.180
the virtual console.

02:59:37.180 --> 02:59:40.300
And I just think that's the wrong direction for Nintendo in general.

02:59:40.300 --> 02:59:41.900
It just, it sucks for the rest of us.

02:59:41.900 --> 02:59:44.140
And I, yeah, it does.

02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:44.940
But you know what?

02:59:44.940 --> 02:59:47.020
I think that just comes with the territory.

02:59:47.020 --> 02:59:49.500
I was, you know, gaming on a Nintendo platform.

02:59:50.220 --> 02:59:52.460
We're just going to have to do those things on other platforms.

02:59:53.740 --> 02:59:58.140
Well, I think Nintendo's other thing too is that just because a parent should do something,

02:59:58.140 --> 03:00:00.700
they know not all parents will do something.

03:00:00.700 --> 03:00:02.860
So it keeps their reputation safe.

03:00:03.420 --> 03:00:05.180
They have their brand to look after.

03:00:05.180 --> 03:00:05.980
Exactly.

03:00:05.980 --> 03:00:06.540
Exactly.

03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:12.940
So the, anyway, the second thing I wanted to bring up was Forza 5 microtransactions.

03:00:12.940 --> 03:00:16.860
You know, it seems like you guys don't think it's a really big deal, but I'm going to give

03:00:16.860 --> 03:00:20.140
you three reasons why folks are up in arms about it.

03:00:20.860 --> 03:00:26.460
Number one, in older Forza games, by playing through the game and completing the challenges

03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:29.980
or whatever, occasionally you would get cars for free.

03:00:29.980 --> 03:00:32.620
Hey, you cleared this thing, you get this car.

03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:34.700
They don't do that anymore in 5.

03:00:35.340 --> 03:00:42.780
You cannot earn cars by any means except buying them with credits or tokens, except for the

03:00:42.780 --> 03:00:46.460
very first car you get when you start the game, because how can you drive without one?

03:00:46.940 --> 03:00:51.100
So it's not like what we were just saying about Gran Turismo 6, where you just unlock

03:00:51.100 --> 03:00:52.140
them through the course of the story.

03:00:52.140 --> 03:00:55.180
Anyway, I had the impression that these two games are in very similar boats.

03:00:56.540 --> 03:00:58.860
You have to buy all of the cars now.

03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:00.380
At least that's what I've read online.

03:01:00.380 --> 03:01:02.140
I just started playing the game myself.

03:01:02.140 --> 03:01:06.060
I haven't really gotten to, you know, a point where I would want to buy another car yet.

03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:10.780
But from what I've been reading in Amazon reviews and Game Facts posts and other places,

03:01:10.780 --> 03:01:14.460
there are no free cars anymore except the one you get at the start.

03:01:14.460 --> 03:01:15.980
You have to buy everything.

03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:18.220
Now, ready for your mind to be blown?

03:01:19.340 --> 03:01:21.260
This is how DLC cars work.

03:01:21.260 --> 03:01:22.460
This is item number two.

03:01:23.580 --> 03:01:25.900
You pay real money for the DLC, yes?

03:01:28.060 --> 03:01:33.980
When you do this, this adds the cars to the game, but you cannot actually drive the cars

03:01:33.980 --> 03:01:36.700
until you buy them from the in-game shop.

03:01:39.260 --> 03:01:43.260
And if you don't have enough credits to do that, you get to open your wallet again and

03:01:43.260 --> 03:01:45.980
essentially pay twice to use these cars.

03:01:47.100 --> 03:01:47.600
Huh.

03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:49.040
Yep.

03:01:49.980 --> 03:01:50.780
I'm waiting.

03:01:50.780 --> 03:01:54.460
I'm really hoping somebody in the chat room here is going to jump in and say you're wrong.

03:01:54.460 --> 03:01:55.980
Like, no offense, but I just-

03:01:55.980 --> 03:01:57.180
I would hope so too.

03:01:57.180 --> 03:01:58.140
That would be great.

03:01:58.140 --> 03:02:00.140
I hope someone tells me that.

03:02:00.140 --> 03:02:03.740
Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf went to bed, and I know he's been playing the game, so-

03:02:03.740 --> 03:02:05.500
He said the exact same thing, though, on his show.

03:02:05.500 --> 03:02:05.980
Really?

03:02:05.980 --> 03:02:06.380
I want to say, yeah.

03:02:08.060 --> 03:02:10.620
Well, you know, here's the thing.

03:02:10.620 --> 03:02:15.100
Number three item, which basically makes one and two worse, is credits are earned slower

03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:17.580
in the game than they were in Forza 4, so-

03:02:17.580 --> 03:02:24.700
I will give this little thing, and that is that, okay, well, there's a lot of DLC that

03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:29.740
you download that you can't really play until you get to a certain point in the game, but

03:02:29.740 --> 03:02:33.900
I don't know, something just seems really, really tacky about it.

03:02:33.900 --> 03:02:34.620
Super tacky.

03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:37.820
DKBeast in chat at live.vognetware.com says he's not wrong.

03:02:37.820 --> 03:02:39.420
Wow.

03:02:39.420 --> 03:02:42.300
Yeah, I was really hoping I would be, but no.

03:02:43.020 --> 03:02:45.420
And the developer has responded.

03:02:45.420 --> 03:02:50.700
Basically what happened was if someone bought, like, one of the most expensive cars early

03:02:50.700 --> 03:02:53.660
on, they give you a free other car.

03:02:53.660 --> 03:02:57.740
If not, they give you that car for free, but in order to get in on this, you had to buy

03:02:57.740 --> 03:03:01.340
the game at launch and join their, like, Forza rewards program or whatever.

03:03:01.340 --> 03:03:02.380
I don't know what that is.

03:03:02.380 --> 03:03:02.700
Wow.

03:03:03.820 --> 03:03:07.420
So it's a mess, and I really don't like this whole-

03:03:07.420 --> 03:03:11.340
you bought a $60 game, now we'll throw free-to-play type elements into it.

03:03:12.060 --> 03:03:14.780
It's something I hope doesn't last too long.

03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:15.980
I really hope so.

03:03:15.980 --> 03:03:17.820
I hope people reject that.

03:03:17.820 --> 03:03:19.180
Anyway, you said you had one more thing?

03:03:19.900 --> 03:03:25.100
The last point I wanted to make, on the subject of Loki being too harsh towards the new consoles,

03:03:25.100 --> 03:03:26.300
no, I don't agree.

03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:28.300
I don't think he was overly harsh at all.

03:03:28.300 --> 03:03:31.740
The fact of the matter is, the games aren't there yet.

03:03:31.740 --> 03:03:36.060
I mean, I bought the next one because I want to be one of the first, you know,

03:03:36.700 --> 03:03:41.580
developers who didn't get into the early program to put games on the system.

03:03:41.580 --> 03:03:44.700
You know, I didn't buy it because I had to have it.

03:03:44.700 --> 03:03:49.260
The game I've most been looking forward to playing is Peggle 2, and that comes out tomorrow.

03:03:50.700 --> 03:03:51.200
Good choice.

03:03:52.060 --> 03:03:55.420
I got Forza 5, I got Dead Rising 3, they've mostly been sitting there.

03:03:56.220 --> 03:04:00.300
So it's like, you know, the Skype thing is cool.

03:04:00.300 --> 03:04:03.020
The TV features are neat, but I don't use most of them.

03:04:03.020 --> 03:04:09.660
I just, you know, it's cool to be able to say, okay, watch CNN or watch Comedy Central

03:04:09.660 --> 03:04:13.740
or whatever, and the Xbox One will push the buttons on your cable box for you.

03:04:14.460 --> 03:04:17.180
And again, this call coming from an Xbox One.

03:04:18.300 --> 03:04:22.620
It's cute, you know, it's nice, but it's not a have-to-have kind of thing.

03:04:22.620 --> 03:04:26.380
There's no real reason, in my opinion, to own one of these boxes right now.

03:04:26.380 --> 03:04:26.780
Wow.

03:04:26.780 --> 03:04:28.940
And there's no real reason to own a PS4.

03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:30.620
Not yet.

03:04:30.620 --> 03:04:32.060
The games aren't there yet.

03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:32.540
Not yet.

03:04:33.100 --> 03:04:33.580
All right.

03:04:33.580 --> 03:04:35.500
YYR, this has been a fantastic call.

03:04:35.500 --> 03:04:35.980
I love this.

03:04:35.980 --> 03:04:38.060
I got to let you go so we can get some more calls.

03:04:38.060 --> 03:04:39.340
But thank you for demoing.

03:04:39.340 --> 03:04:41.580
One quick thing, actually, yeah, really quick.

03:04:42.140 --> 03:04:48.460
The last thing from PastoLR, Jamie said, Jamie pointed out that our society, our government,

03:04:48.460 --> 03:04:51.180
and our healthcare systems don't give enough attention to mental health.

03:04:51.740 --> 03:04:54.140
Probably the truest statement that ever was.

03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:56.380
This needs to be dealt with.

03:04:56.380 --> 03:04:57.580
It needs to be looked into.

03:04:57.580 --> 03:04:59.420
It needs to be focused on.

03:04:59.420 --> 03:05:00.860
It's really important.

03:05:00.860 --> 03:05:01.820
I agree with that.

03:05:01.820 --> 03:05:02.380
Absolutely.

03:05:02.940 --> 03:05:03.180
All right.

03:05:03.180 --> 03:05:07.500
YYR, thank you so much for binge listening to OLR and then calling us from your Xbox

03:05:07.500 --> 03:05:07.660
One.

03:05:07.660 --> 03:05:08.780
I appreciate it.

03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:09.900
And he was very well prepared.

03:05:09.900 --> 03:05:11.180
Too much is never enough.

03:05:11.180 --> 03:05:11.500
All right.

03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:12.140
Take care, buddy.

03:05:12.940 --> 03:05:13.500
You too.

03:05:13.500 --> 03:05:13.820
Bye.

03:05:14.460 --> 03:05:15.740
Always a pleasure to hear from him.

03:05:15.740 --> 03:05:18.780
And that was a lot of fun to go to the Xbox One for the calls.

03:05:18.780 --> 03:05:19.260
But whoa.

03:05:20.220 --> 03:05:21.020
What the fuck was that?

03:05:21.020 --> 03:05:22.220
Are we dialed into AOL?

03:05:22.220 --> 03:05:23.020
Did somebody here-

03:05:23.020 --> 03:05:24.220
Are we connected to a BBS?

03:05:24.220 --> 03:05:25.020
Did somebody just-

03:05:25.020 --> 03:05:25.980
Did we just call a fax machine?

03:05:25.980 --> 03:05:28.060
Was that a fax machine that was calling us?

03:05:28.060 --> 03:05:30.460
By the way, Rob, you know what's actually super funny?

03:05:31.420 --> 03:05:33.980
Is that Tiara just beat Mass Effect 2.

03:05:33.980 --> 03:05:34.220
Yeah.

03:05:34.220 --> 03:05:35.580
And she romanced Garrus.

03:05:35.580 --> 03:05:36.300
1877-

03:05:36.300 --> 03:05:38.300
Definitely sister after my own heart.

03:05:38.300 --> 03:05:40.700
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.

03:05:40.700 --> 03:05:42.060
Orange Lounge Radio.

03:05:42.060 --> 03:05:42.700
All one word.

03:05:42.700 --> 03:05:44.220
But the phone is still ringing off the hook.

03:05:44.220 --> 03:05:45.180
Let's go to it.

03:05:45.180 --> 03:05:46.220
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:46.620
Who's this?

03:05:48.060 --> 03:05:48.460
Second.

03:05:48.460 --> 03:05:50.060
Trying to fix my- can you hear me?

03:05:50.060 --> 03:05:50.780
Yes, we can hear you.

03:05:50.780 --> 03:05:51.020
Hi.

03:05:51.580 --> 03:05:52.780
I had to fix my iPhone.

03:05:52.780 --> 03:05:55.900
Anyway, I just wanted to call real quickly about Danny Wells.

03:05:55.900 --> 03:05:56.140
Yeah.

03:05:56.140 --> 03:05:57.100
This guy's Judo, right?

03:05:57.660 --> 03:05:57.900
Yeah.

03:05:57.900 --> 03:05:58.380
Guy Judo.

03:05:58.380 --> 03:05:58.700
Hey, buddy.

03:05:58.700 --> 03:05:59.180
How you doing?

03:06:00.060 --> 03:06:00.380
All right.

03:06:01.260 --> 03:06:01.420
Yeah.

03:06:01.420 --> 03:06:04.540
What I just wanted to mention was I didn't know him as Mario.

03:06:04.540 --> 03:06:07.180
I knew him as the bartender on the Jeffersons.

03:06:07.180 --> 03:06:09.340
That's where he's mostly known for me.

03:06:09.340 --> 03:06:10.300
Oh, my God.

03:06:10.300 --> 03:06:11.020
That's right.

03:06:11.020 --> 03:06:12.140
He was, wasn't he?

03:06:12.780 --> 03:06:12.940
Yeah.

03:06:12.940 --> 03:06:14.860
He was Charlie on the Jeffersons for years.

03:06:14.860 --> 03:06:18.620
So that's really where his notoriety comes from, you know?

03:06:18.620 --> 03:06:21.340
So many talented people on that show are deceased.

03:06:21.340 --> 03:06:24.220
You know, I mean, is anybody from that show?

03:06:24.220 --> 03:06:26.620
I mean, I know we lost Sherman Helmsley.

03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:28.700
We lost Roxy Roker a long time ago.

03:06:28.780 --> 03:06:31.260
I mean, there's so many people from that show that aren't around anymore.

03:06:31.260 --> 03:06:33.660
I think Bentley might still be alive.

03:06:33.660 --> 03:06:35.500
I think Florence is still alive, too.

03:06:35.500 --> 03:06:36.140
Oh, yeah.

03:06:36.140 --> 03:06:38.860
Florence is alive, but I think family's alive, too.

03:06:39.740 --> 03:06:40.220
Not sure.

03:06:40.860 --> 03:06:42.300
But yeah, that's where I knew him from.

03:06:42.300 --> 03:06:44.620
And I was looking him up on IMDB.

03:06:44.620 --> 03:06:45.500
I didn't even know that.

03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:47.260
This is another video game related thing.

03:06:47.260 --> 03:06:50.620
He did some voice acting for one of the Splinter Cell games.

03:06:51.420 --> 03:06:53.420
So he's been connected with video games.

03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:54.380
That's really cool.

03:06:55.020 --> 03:06:58.380
Well, I like that you're recognizing him for things that

03:06:58.620 --> 03:06:59.340
aren't just Luigi.

03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:02.220
I mean, obviously, our community remembers him for that an awful lot.

03:07:02.220 --> 03:07:03.500
But that's great.

03:07:03.500 --> 03:07:05.900
That's some awesome little, like, trivia type stuff.

03:07:05.900 --> 03:07:06.400
That's cool.

03:07:07.020 --> 03:07:07.180
Yeah.

03:07:07.180 --> 03:07:09.580
If you grew up in the 80s, I mean, you know that guy's face.

03:07:09.580 --> 03:07:12.620
I mean, he's been like an extra on so many television shows.

03:07:12.620 --> 03:07:16.140
He's always playing, like, some kind of slimy, carn-artist type of guy.

03:07:16.780 --> 03:07:18.380
He just has one of those faces.

03:07:18.380 --> 03:07:21.020
Well, plus, you know, I mentioned earlier in the show,

03:07:21.020 --> 03:07:23.020
I binged on game shows a lot when I was a kid.

03:07:23.020 --> 03:07:25.100
And what came on after game show binges?

03:07:25.100 --> 03:07:26.460
The Jeffersons.

03:07:26.940 --> 03:07:27.420
Moving on.

03:07:28.220 --> 03:07:29.180
Freaking love that show.

03:07:29.180 --> 03:07:30.380
Yeah, that show is great.

03:07:30.380 --> 03:07:32.460
A spin-off of All in the Family.

03:07:32.460 --> 03:07:34.380
Never realized that till years later.

03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:36.860
Yeah, we could talk about TV for hours.

03:07:36.860 --> 03:07:39.740
But yeah, All in the Family, we had so many freaking spin-offs.

03:07:41.340 --> 03:07:45.420
You can even count Good Times as a spin-off from All in the Family.

03:07:45.420 --> 03:07:45.900
That's true.

03:07:45.900 --> 03:07:51.580
Because the mother came from Maud, which was a spin-off of the All in the Family.

03:07:51.900 --> 03:07:58.540
All right, we need to write all this down for Dark Sakura's future I'm a Nerd in 30 show.

03:08:00.940 --> 03:08:03.980
You're gonna have an episode all about connections to All in the Family.

03:08:05.980 --> 03:08:07.180
And one last thing.

03:08:07.980 --> 03:08:12.460
When you guys mentioned the game show that let you run around and, like, pick video games.

03:08:13.660 --> 03:08:17.260
I thought, at first, I thought you met this other game show that I love called,

03:08:17.260 --> 03:08:19.580
it was like, it was a take-off of the new League of Legends game.

03:08:19.580 --> 03:08:20.860
It was called I'm Telling.

03:08:20.860 --> 03:08:22.300
We had, like, a brother and sister.

03:08:22.300 --> 03:08:23.020
I remember that show.

03:08:23.020 --> 03:08:24.060
That show is great.

03:08:24.060 --> 03:08:26.300
Yes, that was great.

03:08:26.300 --> 03:08:29.420
And they had a similar thing where they will let you run through a maze and, like,

03:08:29.420 --> 03:08:34.140
you hit, like, this little siren thing to try to match with your brother or sister pick.

03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:35.500
Then you would get all the prizes.

03:08:35.500 --> 03:08:36.380
That was just cool.

03:08:36.380 --> 03:08:37.580
I so remember that.

03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:40.860
And, like, because I was virtually, I mean, I do have a brother and a sister,

03:08:40.860 --> 03:08:43.580
but they're 14 and 16 years older than me.

03:08:43.580 --> 03:08:46.060
So I was kind of like an only child growing up.

03:08:46.060 --> 03:08:49.340
And I always was like, I want somebody to go on this show with.

03:08:49.340 --> 03:08:51.260
But, you know, it was never going to happen.

03:08:51.260 --> 03:08:53.420
Yeah, they should have done a Friends edition.

03:08:53.420 --> 03:08:54.860
That would have been, that would have worked.

03:08:54.860 --> 03:08:55.340
Yeah.

03:08:55.340 --> 03:08:55.980
Oh, yeah.

03:08:55.980 --> 03:08:56.940
That's all I got for you.

03:08:56.940 --> 03:08:58.780
Kaijuto, thanks for the walk down memory lane.

03:08:58.780 --> 03:08:59.260
Appreciate it.

03:08:59.260 --> 03:09:00.220
Have a good one.

03:09:00.220 --> 03:09:00.460
All right.

03:09:00.460 --> 03:09:00.860
You too.

03:09:00.860 --> 03:09:01.180
All right.

03:09:01.180 --> 03:09:01.900
Bye.

03:09:01.900 --> 03:09:03.980
Great tribute to Danny Wells.

03:09:03.980 --> 03:09:05.580
What about the other things Danny Wells did?

03:09:05.580 --> 03:09:06.460
Those are great.

03:09:06.460 --> 03:09:07.100
I love that.

03:09:07.100 --> 03:09:10.140
You know Dark Soccer, 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype,

03:09:10.140 --> 03:09:12.140
Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

03:09:12.140 --> 03:09:15.900
You know, Dark Soccer, if you were to do a show like that,

03:09:15.900 --> 03:09:17.740
like the nerd stuff and I'm 30 or whatever,

03:09:17.740 --> 03:09:19.180
I could see in the theme song for you.

03:09:20.220 --> 03:09:22.860
Those were the days.

03:09:23.500 --> 03:09:24.220
Answer the phone.

03:09:27.820 --> 03:09:28.780
We don't like my singing.

03:09:28.780 --> 03:09:30.380
1877 Game OLR.

03:09:30.380 --> 03:09:31.020
Oh, hi.

03:09:31.020 --> 03:09:31.420
Hi.

03:09:31.420 --> 03:09:32.620
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:09:32.620 --> 03:09:33.420
Who's this?

03:09:33.420 --> 03:09:35.980
This is the one and only Ron McCalling from Brooklyn.

03:09:35.980 --> 03:09:36.860
Hi, Rama.

03:09:36.860 --> 03:09:38.060
And you're on webcam too.

03:09:38.060 --> 03:09:39.820
Are you calling us from your Xbox One?

03:09:40.620 --> 03:09:43.420
Yeah, I'm calling from pre-Xbox One.

03:09:43.420 --> 03:09:46.620
It's called having Skype next to your Xbox 360

03:09:46.620 --> 03:09:48.700
and chatting that way because it's a lot more fun

03:09:48.700 --> 03:09:50.940
and you can shit talk that way without having Microsoft

03:09:50.940 --> 03:09:52.140
kind of breathing down your throat.

03:09:52.140 --> 03:09:54.380
So you're calling us from an Xbox Vision camera?

03:09:55.100 --> 03:09:55.740
Actually, no.

03:09:55.740 --> 03:09:57.580
I'm calling from my awesome Logitech camera.

03:09:57.580 --> 03:09:58.080
Awesome.

03:09:58.940 --> 03:10:01.500
Well, I noticed you got your Luigi hat on

03:10:01.500 --> 03:10:03.100
and you got your Luigi coffee cup.

03:10:03.100 --> 03:10:04.300
You have a Luigi coffee cup?

03:10:04.300 --> 03:10:05.260
That's awesome.

03:10:05.260 --> 03:10:06.300
Got it from Nintendo World.

03:10:06.300 --> 03:10:09.580
They also have a Happy Holidays Christmas mug as well.

03:10:09.580 --> 03:10:12.140
You're in your Luigi shirt.

03:10:12.380 --> 03:10:13.740
I see a Luigi shirt that says...

03:10:13.740 --> 03:10:14.300
What does that say?

03:10:14.300 --> 03:10:15.660
It's mirror imaged for me.

03:10:15.660 --> 03:10:16.380
It says the L...

03:10:17.020 --> 03:10:19.020
The L does not stand for loser.

03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:23.740
So you are in full black Luigi mode tonight.

03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:25.180
Yeah, something like that.

03:10:25.180 --> 03:10:28.140
A friend of mine does a webcomic called Sucks to be Weegee

03:10:28.140 --> 03:10:29.340
and it's pretty funny.

03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:31.260
And somewhere around here I have a...

03:10:31.260 --> 03:10:32.700
Oh, here it is.

03:10:32.700 --> 03:10:35.820
I also picked this up from my soon to be tree.

03:10:38.060 --> 03:10:41.100
A Luigi ornament that says Happy Holidays.

03:10:41.660 --> 03:10:42.780
That's adorable.

03:10:43.740 --> 03:10:45.580
Now, I got some stuff we gotta talk about.

03:10:45.580 --> 03:10:47.420
So Rob, get the coffee on.

03:10:47.420 --> 03:10:48.380
We got some talking to do.

03:10:48.380 --> 03:10:49.260
All right.

03:10:49.260 --> 03:10:50.540
I'll get out the cheesecake.

03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:52.220
Oh, fabulous.

03:10:52.220 --> 03:10:52.720
Fabulous.

03:10:53.740 --> 03:10:55.660
Tell me about that one time in St. Olaf.

03:11:00.220 --> 03:11:01.740
Rob, you are something else.

03:11:01.740 --> 03:11:02.380
I know.

03:11:02.380 --> 03:11:03.260
I get that a lot.

03:11:03.260 --> 03:11:03.660
No, really.

03:11:03.660 --> 03:11:04.160
What's up?

03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:08.780
To back what Kaijido said, that's what I knew Danny Wells from

03:11:08.780 --> 03:11:13.500
because when the show first came on, I spotted Luigi before I noticed Mario was

03:11:13.500 --> 03:11:15.260
done by Captain Lou Albano, okay?

03:11:17.020 --> 03:11:21.420
So that whole thing kind of comes full circle to me.

03:11:21.420 --> 03:11:21.920
Yeah.

03:11:22.220 --> 03:11:22.720
Oh.

03:11:23.340 --> 03:11:26.540
Also, I like to say, fuck yes to Square One TV.

03:11:26.540 --> 03:11:30.140
That show got me to run home to watch it, okay?

03:11:30.140 --> 03:11:30.640
Me too.

03:11:31.500 --> 03:11:36.940
Got out of school at 3.10, I was there watching Thundercat to 3.30, Square One TV at 4.

03:11:37.900 --> 03:11:40.860
I think Square One was on for us at like three.

03:11:40.860 --> 03:11:43.980
Like I had to get home fast if I wanted to see it because, you know, elementary school,

03:11:43.980 --> 03:11:44.940
you get out a little earlier.

03:11:44.940 --> 03:11:46.860
PBS affiliates don't have a set schedule.

03:11:46.860 --> 03:11:48.540
It differs from every single market.

03:11:48.540 --> 03:11:51.660
Yeah, I think for us it was on at three, but I think it was timed for like when elementary

03:11:51.660 --> 03:11:53.100
kids get out of school, so it makes sense.

03:11:53.740 --> 03:11:56.380
Yeah, and if I missed it on one PBS station, I could catch it.

03:11:56.380 --> 03:11:59.100
On another PBS station, like an hour or a half hour later.

03:11:59.100 --> 03:12:00.220
You have more than one?

03:12:00.220 --> 03:12:01.740
He's New York City, dude.

03:12:01.740 --> 03:12:06.780
Yeah, we have PBS 13, there's Channel 21, there's 25.

03:12:07.500 --> 03:12:09.980
There's like 50 PBSes.

03:12:09.980 --> 03:12:10.940
Never heard of this before.

03:12:10.940 --> 03:12:13.180
There's a network that we get to Channel 50.

03:12:13.180 --> 03:12:14.140
Well, we get a few of them.

03:12:14.780 --> 03:12:16.940
We've got Channel 6, take it or leave it.

03:12:19.100 --> 03:12:22.860
And the minute you have your antenna, you can pick up stations from Connecticut.

03:12:22.860 --> 03:12:25.500
Oh, that's right, because there's a PBS 9 in Reading.

03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:26.700
Anyway, cool story, bro.

03:12:28.300 --> 03:12:31.340
Let's talk about TV channels in your neck of the woods.

03:12:31.340 --> 03:12:33.740
No, no, let's not, let's not.

03:12:34.700 --> 03:12:39.980
And what I just realized, with Nintendo rehashing all of these video games,

03:12:39.980 --> 03:12:45.660
Nintendo is becoming that old celebrity is trying to relive their prime with another greatest hits.

03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:47.740
That's what it's like this time.

03:12:47.740 --> 03:12:50.700
You know, it's like you first have Donkey Kong Country in,

03:12:50.700 --> 03:12:53.900
Donkey Kong Country Returns, Donkey Kong Country comes back again.

03:12:53.900 --> 03:12:57.420
I think the next one's going to be Donkey Kong Country comes out of retirement.

03:12:57.420 --> 03:13:02.460
The only difference is maybe extra level or redone music or something like that.

03:13:02.540 --> 03:13:04.300
Donkey Kong is getting up there in age.

03:13:05.180 --> 03:13:08.220
Yeah, how about Donkey Kong gets out of retirement home?

03:13:09.100 --> 03:13:12.780
Are you looking forward to the new Donkey Kong Country game or are you over it?

03:13:13.500 --> 03:13:14.300
I'm over it.

03:13:14.300 --> 03:13:17.260
Like I said, I'm only picking up a Wii U once, Bayonetta 2,

03:13:17.260 --> 03:13:18.620
and Mario Kart 8 comes out.

03:13:18.620 --> 03:13:20.460
Other than that, it can wait.

03:13:20.460 --> 03:13:21.900
Mario Kart 8 is what, April?

03:13:22.780 --> 03:13:23.420
Yeah.

03:13:23.420 --> 03:13:26.460
I don't think they really have a date yet for it, but I think it was around April.

03:13:26.460 --> 03:13:27.980
Yeah, April or Mayesh.

03:13:27.980 --> 03:13:30.060
I am living for Mario Kart 8.

03:13:30.060 --> 03:13:31.420
It better deliver.

03:13:32.220 --> 03:13:35.260
Yeah, even if it gets delayed, I'm like, I can wait.

03:13:35.820 --> 03:13:41.340
Yeah, if it's a great Mario Kart game, it'll be worth the wait.

03:13:41.340 --> 03:13:41.580
Yes.

03:13:43.180 --> 03:13:45.260
A couple of things.

03:13:45.260 --> 03:13:49.900
I think last week, a week prior, I talked about podcasting and the Sound Blaster card and stuff.

03:13:51.500 --> 03:13:55.020
Any desktop PC off the shelf can do the same thing.

03:13:55.020 --> 03:13:57.420
You have to go into the settings and enable it.

03:13:57.420 --> 03:13:58.220
You can do it.

03:13:58.220 --> 03:14:00.140
Oh, for some reason,

03:14:00.140 --> 03:14:01.900
my studio computer doesn't do it so well.

03:14:01.900 --> 03:14:04.300
And I just want to point out, just for our listeners,

03:14:04.300 --> 03:14:06.780
Rama's call quality is dropping significantly,

03:14:06.780 --> 03:14:08.700
so that's why his voice kind of changed a little bit.

03:14:08.700 --> 03:14:09.740
I don't know what's going on.

03:14:09.740 --> 03:14:12.140
He might need to stop his porn torrents or...

03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:12.620
No, I just...

03:14:13.260 --> 03:14:18.380
Sometimes, with all the 50 PBSs transmitting signals in New York City,

03:14:18.380 --> 03:14:20.860
sometimes the signal gets a little clogged.

03:14:20.860 --> 03:14:23.100
I'm not sure if you're following porn by PBS.

03:14:23.100 --> 03:14:23.580
Never mind.

03:14:24.780 --> 03:14:25.580
Well, I think you're right.

03:14:25.580 --> 03:14:28.860
It is my porn torrents.

03:14:28.860 --> 03:14:32.300
Finally, finally, somebody fesses that fuck up on this show.

03:14:32.300 --> 03:14:34.460
Yes, Robin, it was my porn torrents.

03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:35.180
Thank you.

03:14:35.180 --> 03:14:36.380
You're an honest man.

03:14:37.100 --> 03:14:39.340
I abuse my files connection.

03:14:39.340 --> 03:14:42.860
I get 66 megs coming down, 33 megs going up.

03:14:42.860 --> 03:14:46.380
All right, Rama, a quick last thought to get out here before we let you go.

03:14:47.420 --> 03:14:47.740
Yes.

03:14:48.460 --> 03:14:50.300
Okay, my last thought is this.

03:14:51.340 --> 03:14:54.540
If you want to play classic Nintendo cartridges on your Wii U,

03:14:54.540 --> 03:14:59.500
turn your Wii U on, push start A, and a spot will pop up for classic cartridges.

03:15:00.460 --> 03:15:04.060
Okay, go post that to 4chan and see if somebody believes you.

03:15:04.060 --> 03:15:09.420
All right, Rama, it's getting very crackly and stuff, so I really have to let you go.

03:15:09.420 --> 03:15:12.140
But thanks so much for the call, and have a good one, okay?

03:15:13.500 --> 03:15:14.060
All right, bye.

03:15:14.700 --> 03:15:18.700
Rama, anime jam session on Tuesday nights, everybody, here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

03:15:19.340 --> 03:15:21.020
We can probably squeeze in one more call.

03:15:22.220 --> 03:15:23.980
There's a little ad on my Skype right now.

03:15:23.980 --> 03:15:28.380
I just want to point out, talk to friends while watching live TV with Skype on Xbox One.

03:15:28.380 --> 03:15:28.880
No.

03:15:31.420 --> 03:15:34.060
There's no box for me to respond, so.

03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:39.260
All right, 1877 Game O-L-R or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:41.900
I do want to see if I can at least get to some of these Twitter topics,

03:15:41.900 --> 03:15:43.740
because we had some good Twitter topics come in,

03:15:43.740 --> 03:15:46.220
and we're falling a little behind here on the show.

03:15:46.780 --> 03:15:48.220
Loki, did you have any last minute stories?

03:15:48.780 --> 03:15:49.740
Uh, no.

03:15:49.740 --> 03:15:50.460
No, okay.

03:15:51.100 --> 03:15:53.180
Um, let's see.

03:15:54.060 --> 03:16:00.220
Surtur wanted to ask, he hopes that Bobby and us talk about Grand Tourism.

03:16:00.220 --> 03:16:02.300
Grand Tourismo 6 tonight.

03:16:02.300 --> 03:16:06.940
You know what, Dan, we got it, and Dan's been playing the crap out of it.

03:16:06.940 --> 03:16:09.180
He really liked it, and then he actually watched football,

03:16:09.180 --> 03:16:10.940
which made me wonder who replaced my husband.

03:16:13.020 --> 03:16:14.460
Dan doesn't usually watch football?

03:16:14.460 --> 03:16:16.380
He does sometimes, but usually with other people.

03:16:16.380 --> 03:16:17.820
He was in there watching it by himself.

03:16:17.820 --> 03:16:19.660
I'm like, where's my husband?

03:16:20.460 --> 03:16:20.940
Who are you?

03:16:21.980 --> 03:16:23.820
Uh, Spazinator tweets us and asks,

03:16:23.820 --> 03:16:26.780
Loki, quadruple cheese and quadruple bacon pizza,

03:16:26.780 --> 03:16:28.700
or quadruple bacon double cheeseburger?

03:16:28.700 --> 03:16:29.420
I can answer that.

03:16:29.420 --> 03:16:29.920
Pizza.

03:16:30.780 --> 03:16:33.660
No, because that much cheese on the pizza is actually not very good,

03:16:33.660 --> 03:16:36.540
and even extra cheese on the pizza is not very good.

03:16:36.540 --> 03:16:38.860
And when you do quadruple cheese, trust me, I've seen it before.

03:16:38.860 --> 03:16:41.980
It's just, it's not as good as you'd think, because it's too much.

03:16:41.980 --> 03:16:43.740
That's a lot of grease you're adding on there,

03:16:43.740 --> 03:16:46.540
and it just, it throws off the magic ratio.

03:16:46.540 --> 03:16:48.620
Adding tons of bacon though, go right ahead.

03:16:48.620 --> 03:16:50.460
You're taking that question way too seriously.

03:16:50.460 --> 03:16:50.940
I know.

03:16:50.940 --> 03:16:51.500
All right.

03:16:51.500 --> 03:16:54.060
How do you think he didn't take it far enough, to be honest?

03:16:54.060 --> 03:16:57.180
1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:16:57.180 --> 03:16:58.300
I wonder if that was on our end,

03:16:58.300 --> 03:17:00.460
because we were getting more calls a minute ago,

03:17:00.460 --> 03:17:03.020
and now nothing is lighting up, sad face.

03:17:03.020 --> 03:17:04.620
Okay, let's see.

03:17:06.140 --> 03:17:07.580
ActDeft tweeted us,

03:17:08.540 --> 03:17:12.460
there's more info surrounding the legend of Sonic 3's soundtrack.

03:17:12.460 --> 03:17:14.860
I wonder if this ties into the whole Michael Jackson thing,

03:17:14.860 --> 03:17:17.580
because wasn't there a, wasn't there like a,

03:17:18.220 --> 03:17:19.820
somebody ran a whole thing on that.

03:17:19.820 --> 03:17:20.700
He didn't like,

03:17:20.700 --> 03:17:22.780
Jackson didn't like the limitations of the sound chip,

03:17:22.780 --> 03:17:23.740
didn't like the way the,

03:17:24.460 --> 03:17:26.220
he didn't like the results of the soundtrack,

03:17:26.220 --> 03:17:28.620
so they still kept some of the inspiration,

03:17:28.620 --> 03:17:32.140
but ultimately he wasn't credited and specifically involved.

03:17:32.140 --> 03:17:32.780
Okay, apparently though,

03:17:32.780 --> 03:17:34.780
this actually doesn't have to do with the game trailers thing.

03:17:34.780 --> 03:17:37.100
Apparently, and this is the story that ActDeft leaked us,

03:17:37.100 --> 03:17:40.060
just to kind of try to cover this quickly,

03:17:42.060 --> 03:17:45.900
Fever, it's Fervor, Fervor Records on YouTube,

03:17:45.900 --> 03:17:50.700
posted some unreleased music tracks from the band the Jetsons,

03:17:50.700 --> 03:17:53.100
not the Jetsons, but the Jetsons.

03:17:53.100 --> 03:17:53.580
Clever.

03:17:53.580 --> 03:17:59.900
And one track called Hard Times was somewhat like the theme of Ice Cap Zone.

03:17:59.900 --> 03:18:01.740
Well, why does that fucking matter?

03:18:01.740 --> 03:18:04.460
Because the keyboardist of the group, who is Brad Buxer,

03:18:05.340 --> 03:18:08.060
worked on the title along with Michael Jackson,

03:18:08.060 --> 03:18:09.660
which he said in an interview.

03:18:09.660 --> 03:18:12.540
He's not sure what material the developers used in the game,

03:18:12.540 --> 03:18:15.740
but I guess it was remnants of that unreleased song,

03:18:16.620 --> 03:18:18.700
so you know what?

03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:20.380
Michael Jackson had something to do with it.

03:18:20.380 --> 03:18:22.780
And because Michael Jackson is such a perfectionist,

03:18:23.420 --> 03:18:26.060
I would fully believe that he just didn't like the way it was turning out.

03:18:26.060 --> 03:18:27.580
So he walked away from it easily.

03:18:27.580 --> 03:18:28.140
Easily.

03:18:28.140 --> 03:18:31.180
I think that's the simple, simple story we have there.

03:18:32.860 --> 03:18:35.100
Let me get to the calls real quick here.

03:18:35.100 --> 03:18:36.140
We got one more call coming in.

03:18:36.140 --> 03:18:37.100
This will probably be up for tonight.

03:18:37.100 --> 03:18:38.060
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:18:38.060 --> 03:18:38.560
Who's this?

03:18:39.980 --> 03:18:41.580
Hey, Zaku, we haven't heard from you in a while.

03:18:41.580 --> 03:18:42.080
What's up, buddy?

03:18:42.940 --> 03:18:43.980
Oh, not that much.

03:18:43.980 --> 03:18:48.380
Just trying to chill on my night off.

03:18:48.380 --> 03:18:51.100
Well, somebody turned out the lights,

03:18:51.100 --> 03:18:53.260
but we're getting a lot of video calls tonight.

03:18:53.260 --> 03:18:53.980
I like this.

03:18:53.980 --> 03:18:55.180
So what's up, buddy?

03:18:56.220 --> 03:18:58.140
No, I'm just trying to clean up Steam right now.

03:18:58.140 --> 03:19:01.100
Managed to get like a second hard drive.

03:19:01.820 --> 03:19:03.660
Well, actually two of them set up in raid,

03:19:03.660 --> 03:19:08.620
but the idea is I'm gonna start moving my Steam games towards that one

03:19:09.420 --> 03:19:11.660
and then actually downloading whatever else I don't have,

03:19:11.660 --> 03:19:13.500
whatever else is in my backlog right now.

03:19:14.620 --> 03:19:17.580
You look like you woke up at six in the morning to call this program.

03:19:19.180 --> 03:19:21.020
I'm just like getting ready to go to bed.

03:19:21.580 --> 03:19:22.140
It's all good.

03:19:22.140 --> 03:19:22.620
It's all good.

03:19:22.620 --> 03:19:24.860
Just don't mind the sore throat and congestion.

03:19:24.860 --> 03:19:26.700
So what are you playing on Steam then?

03:19:26.700 --> 03:19:28.140
What's your big Steam games of choice

03:19:28.140 --> 03:19:30.220
that you got to move everything around to make space and stuff?

03:19:31.100 --> 03:19:34.380
Well, I'm just trying to get stuff like the orange box,

03:19:34.380 --> 03:19:36.620
all the other, you know, the other Half-Life games.

03:19:36.620 --> 03:19:41.660
I just like, I guess I lost track and never actually got around to downloading it.

03:19:42.380 --> 03:19:45.020
And then, you know, stuff like the two, you know,

03:19:45.020 --> 03:19:49.500
the first two Mass Effect that I have and Sleeping Dogs.

03:19:51.100 --> 03:19:54.700
I don't know if I want to do GTA 4 because I'm still on five, obviously.

03:19:55.340 --> 03:19:59.100
And I still have Arkham Asylum and Arkham City that I still have to like fire up.

03:20:01.260 --> 03:20:04.780
Everybody's got a backlog the size of 50 PBS stations

03:20:05.420 --> 03:20:07.900
that they have to work their way through this holiday season.

03:20:07.900 --> 03:20:10.860
Thank gosh, there's no more games coming out right now.

03:20:10.860 --> 03:20:13.500
But what, what, what can, what can the listeners of our show

03:20:13.500 --> 03:20:15.260
or what can we help you with tonight, Zaku?

03:20:16.460 --> 03:20:20.700
Um, I, I guess, have you noticed, like, um,

03:20:20.700 --> 03:20:25.820
I don't know if you covered this already, but remember that fighting game Skullgirls?

03:20:26.380 --> 03:20:26.860
Yes.

03:20:26.860 --> 03:20:28.140
Yeah, I get to play that tonight.

03:20:29.180 --> 03:20:31.820
Um, apparently in two weeks,

03:20:31.820 --> 03:20:35.900
their publisher Konami is pulling their games from the PSN and Xbox Live.

03:20:35.900 --> 03:20:36.780
I caught you.

03:20:36.780 --> 03:20:40.700
You did wake up just to call this show because we did talk about that about an hour ago.

03:20:40.860 --> 03:20:44.140
So yes, we touched on some of the basics of that, but what, what are your thoughts with that?

03:20:45.580 --> 03:20:45.980
I don't know.

03:20:45.980 --> 03:20:48.700
I mean, this is this, this typical behavior of them.

03:20:49.580 --> 03:20:53.900
I mean, if it's not, if it's them, like, you know, screwing over

03:20:55.020 --> 03:20:59.020
itg or basically not giving shit about the money series,

03:20:59.580 --> 03:21:01.900
it's them screwing over independent developers.

03:21:01.900 --> 03:21:06.140
Well, hold on though, because I mean, and granted, I'm not going to be,

03:21:06.140 --> 03:21:09.820
I'm not going to claim to be up and up on Skullgirls and everything that's going on,

03:21:09.820 --> 03:21:12.780
but my understanding from what I'm reading is that they had an agreement.

03:21:12.780 --> 03:21:14.860
The agreement is ending as of such and such date.

03:21:14.860 --> 03:21:16.700
So Konami says, well, if we're not going to be making

03:21:16.700 --> 03:21:19.100
money from this anymore than Yank, it's getting pulled.

03:21:19.660 --> 03:21:21.820
But they didn't even, they didn't even, uh,

03:21:22.780 --> 03:21:26.620
it didn't even inform their, their actual, uh, their developers.

03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:30.780
They did not like, they did it behind their back.

03:21:30.780 --> 03:21:35.340
Obviously they probably knew, they probably knew about the, the end of the agreement,

03:21:35.340 --> 03:21:39.340
but they didn't even give them a heads up so they can plan a transition.

03:21:40.380 --> 03:21:41.500
That's bad.

03:21:41.500 --> 03:21:43.500
That's like bad business practice.

03:21:43.500 --> 03:21:49.020
Like it's very unprofessional of them, especially if you're in a contract with a particular,

03:21:49.020 --> 03:21:53.580
with another company that you're working with and you don't have the wherewithal to, you know,

03:21:54.460 --> 03:21:58.220
provide for a smooth transition for all the other customers, all the other customers using it.

03:21:58.780 --> 03:22:03.500
Let me, let me ask you this because, you know, what, what would be the best way to kind of

03:22:03.500 --> 03:22:07.340
give that message to Konami that you're not happy with what they did?

03:22:07.340 --> 03:22:10.940
Because obviously the answer is not boycotting Skullgirls because, you know,

03:22:10.940 --> 03:22:13.180
you want to support that game, so that's not the answer.

03:22:13.180 --> 03:22:17.420
And I don't think boycotting all Konami products is really a realistic answer.

03:22:19.420 --> 03:22:21.420
Yeah, there's not, there's not enough stuff coming out.

03:22:21.420 --> 03:22:25.180
So if, if gamers are really pissed off about this, Zaku, like you are,

03:22:25.180 --> 03:22:28.220
what do you think is the best way we can express that to Konami and make them listen?

03:22:28.220 --> 03:22:30.140
Stop buying their iOS and Android games.

03:22:30.140 --> 03:22:31.500
Cause that's where all their business is now.

03:22:33.100 --> 03:22:36.620
They basically, I mean, Babani's gone mobile at this point.

03:22:36.620 --> 03:22:41.500
I don't, other than like niche pockets in arcades and certain parts of the country,

03:22:41.500 --> 03:22:47.340
if not the world, everything else is just them microtransactioning all their, their,

03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:50.060
their IPs, their music, rhythm based IPs.

03:22:51.500 --> 03:22:52.460
That's pretty much it.

03:22:52.460 --> 03:22:55.260
Well, yeah, that's been the state of Mamani for a few years now,

03:22:55.260 --> 03:22:57.420
which is sad and depressing, but other people-

03:22:57.420 --> 03:23:03.580
The principle of a work, you know, an independent, you know, an indie dev trying to, you know,

03:23:03.580 --> 03:23:09.020
find a publisher, give them the light of day, but then at the, you know, the other hand,

03:23:09.020 --> 03:23:12.540
they're actually, you know, they're actually doing not being, you know,

03:23:12.540 --> 03:23:17.500
not giving them the professionalism that they gave them during the whole process.

03:23:18.460 --> 03:23:22.940
As I said, it's, it's what, it's really what happens when you try to work with another,

03:23:23.740 --> 03:23:27.420
with other clients and those clients in particular,

03:23:27.420 --> 03:23:30.860
don't want to give you everything necessary to achieve business goals.

03:23:30.860 --> 03:23:35.580
Well, I'd be curious to see if Konami does end up having to respond to this at all,

03:23:35.580 --> 03:23:38.380
but I don't know, I just kind of have this weird feeling that-

03:23:38.380 --> 03:23:39.180
They probably-

03:23:39.180 --> 03:23:44.620
They probably won't and gamers will support Skullgirls on PC later on and then that's,

03:23:44.620 --> 03:23:45.340
that's that.

03:23:45.340 --> 03:23:45.900
But Zaku-

03:23:45.900 --> 03:23:50.060
I guess what they're trying to do right now is they're trying to find another publisher or

03:23:50.060 --> 03:23:53.980
trying to, well, right now in the short term, they're trying to get another build in,

03:23:53.980 --> 03:23:58.860
they're trying to get an update in just to keep the game alive, per se.

03:23:59.580 --> 03:24:04.140
But in, in terms of, yeah, they're done with Konami at this point, but they just need to,

03:24:05.260 --> 03:24:09.580
they just need to, you know, be more, they need to do a little bit more due diligence

03:24:09.580 --> 03:24:12.140
on their actual, on their future publisher.

03:24:12.780 --> 03:24:15.660
All right, Zaku, I've got to, I've got to wrap this up.

03:24:15.660 --> 03:24:18.940
We've got to go because we're running way late, but you know what?

03:24:18.940 --> 03:24:24.540
I, I'd be, I'd be curious to see what the response is on a greater scale to this because

03:24:24.540 --> 03:24:27.020
obviously there's a lot of people that are pretty unhappy about this.

03:24:27.020 --> 03:24:28.060
But, uh, I don't know.

03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:30.540
I just, I just don't know if it's going to be enough to make waves, but we'll see.

03:24:30.540 --> 03:24:31.100
We'll see.

03:24:31.100 --> 03:24:31.340
All right.

03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:31.740
All right.

03:24:31.740 --> 03:24:32.620
Zaku, take care, buddy.

03:24:32.620 --> 03:24:33.180
Thanks for the call.

03:24:33.180 --> 03:24:33.740
Have a good one.

03:24:33.740 --> 03:24:34.060
All right.

03:24:34.060 --> 03:24:34.860
Sleep well.

03:24:34.860 --> 03:24:35.260
Bye.

03:24:35.260 --> 03:24:36.140
Vitamin C.

03:24:36.140 --> 03:24:37.500
You look like you have a cold.

03:24:37.500 --> 03:24:37.820
All right.

03:24:37.820 --> 03:24:39.580
One, uh, no, no more phone numbers.

03:24:39.580 --> 03:24:39.980
Sorry, guys.

03:24:39.980 --> 03:24:43.100
Sorry to those that didn't get through, but, uh, we're running along tonight, so we've

03:24:43.100 --> 03:24:46.860
got to wrap it on up, but please, uh, you can always email us your thoughts.

03:24:46.860 --> 03:24:50.220
Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com.

03:24:50.220 --> 03:24:53.980
I had one other Twitter topic I wanted to hit on and, and we didn't have last minute

03:24:53.980 --> 03:24:54.620
stories, right?

03:24:55.420 --> 03:24:57.020
S2 100 Matt tweeted us.

03:24:57.020 --> 03:25:03.260
This is sports ball related, but someone took the Alabama versus Auburn unbelievable final

03:25:03.260 --> 03:25:06.300
final play and remade it in Tecmo bowl.

03:25:07.260 --> 03:25:08.140
So, okay.

03:25:08.140 --> 03:25:09.180
I have to watch that.

03:25:09.180 --> 03:25:15.260
And then somebody put this in a way that would make Jamie and I care is really the news I'm

03:25:15.260 --> 03:25:15.660
hearing.

03:25:15.660 --> 03:25:17.180
And then I have to show it to my mother.

03:25:18.060 --> 03:25:21.420
My mom was reporting for Alabama bowl is great.

03:25:21.420 --> 03:25:22.060
All right.

03:25:22.060 --> 03:25:23.420
Uh, we got to wrap it up.

03:25:23.420 --> 03:25:28.220
We are like, so done because, uh, this is almost a four hour show tonight and it's,

03:25:28.220 --> 03:25:31.820
it's not even a marathon show, but thank you guys for staying with us tonight.

03:25:31.820 --> 03:25:33.980
The whole way through really appreciate it.

03:25:33.980 --> 03:25:37.580
You know, we always say here at orange launch radio, if you like the show, all we ask, tell

03:25:37.580 --> 03:25:42.780
a friend or five or 15 or 50 about the show, help us spread the word about orange launch

03:25:42.780 --> 03:25:43.020
radio.

03:25:43.020 --> 03:25:44.060
We really appreciate it.

03:25:44.060 --> 03:25:47.980
Uh, leave us a nice word or a nice review wherever you found this show.

03:25:47.980 --> 03:25:49.820
Maybe that was iTunes podcast.

03:25:49.980 --> 03:25:53.420
Stitcher radio, uh, has been doing great for us lately.

03:25:53.420 --> 03:25:55.420
And we really want to thank the folks at Stitcher.

03:25:55.420 --> 03:25:59.020
I don't know if you guys know this, but we broke the top 15 game shows this past week.

03:25:59.020 --> 03:26:03.820
That, that blows my, blows my mind and that's really because of you guys out there listening

03:26:03.820 --> 03:26:04.540
and supporting the show.

03:26:04.540 --> 03:26:05.580
So I really appreciate it.

03:26:05.580 --> 03:26:07.740
So, uh, leave a nice review and so forth.

03:26:07.740 --> 03:26:09.660
Uh, every little bit helps.

03:26:09.660 --> 03:26:13.340
And I think that's a big part of why we are doing as well as we are over there.

03:26:13.340 --> 03:26:18.780
Um, before we close up shop tonight and play the credits, uh, I gotta get people's final

03:26:18.780 --> 03:26:19.500
thoughts.

03:26:19.500 --> 03:26:21.340
Jason, thank you once again for being here.

03:26:21.340 --> 03:26:22.540
I hope you had a good time.

03:26:22.540 --> 03:26:25.580
Always, always, always, always, always what people may not realize.

03:26:25.580 --> 03:26:31.180
You have to drive an, an hour and 45 minutes to get here one way on a Sunday and you do

03:26:31.180 --> 03:26:35.660
it for this show and then you go back and you, yeah, and you edit the video.

03:26:35.660 --> 03:26:39.020
So you, you are, we, we really appreciate your dedication and thank you.

03:26:39.020 --> 03:26:39.580
Thank you.

03:26:39.580 --> 03:26:43.580
The show would not be possible without you literally because you've also helped us with

03:26:43.580 --> 03:26:44.460
many a web thing.

03:26:44.460 --> 03:26:45.020
So thank you.

03:26:45.020 --> 03:26:45.420
Thank you.

03:26:45.420 --> 03:26:46.540
I always look forward to it.

03:26:46.540 --> 03:26:48.860
Uh, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:26:51.260 --> 03:26:55.260
I am doing a very good job of having ideas, not writing them down and forgetting them.

03:26:55.260 --> 03:26:56.300
So here's to here.

03:26:56.300 --> 03:26:57.180
You forgetfulness.

03:26:57.180 --> 03:26:59.020
You have a laptop in front of you.

03:26:59.020 --> 03:26:59.820
I know.

03:26:59.820 --> 03:27:03.900
Launch that notes application and have it open at all times, sir.

03:27:03.900 --> 03:27:05.740
Yes, I am definitely doing that from here on out.

03:27:05.740 --> 03:27:06.780
That's an order.

03:27:06.780 --> 03:27:07.100
All right.

03:27:07.100 --> 03:27:08.460
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

03:27:09.260 --> 03:27:14.940
Um, I also forgot that I played surgeon simulator 2013 today.

03:27:14.940 --> 03:27:17.020
Or I should say, I let my son watch me do that.

03:27:17.020 --> 03:27:21.900
It was more like knocking stuff off desks, a simulator, because that's what I was doing

03:27:22.460 --> 03:27:25.500
because he was too afraid of the actual surgeries.

03:27:25.500 --> 03:27:26.780
It's like, I don't like this game.

03:27:27.740 --> 03:27:33.580
Um, so yeah, so that's all I have.

03:27:34.460 --> 03:27:34.940
All right.

03:27:34.940 --> 03:27:36.620
And dark soccer, your final thought tonight?

03:27:37.260 --> 03:27:37.760
Meh.

03:27:38.700 --> 03:27:39.420
You know why?

03:27:39.420 --> 03:27:40.060
Why?

03:27:40.060 --> 03:27:42.300
Because I went pink berry and it's not cheat day.

03:27:42.300 --> 03:27:42.800
Okay.

03:27:44.620 --> 03:27:45.020
Okay.

03:27:45.020 --> 03:27:47.500
That's I'm going to leave it at that, uh, beak.

03:27:48.220 --> 03:27:53.500
Yeah, because I may or may not have something in the freezer right now, but I'll save it.

03:27:53.500 --> 03:27:54.220
I'll save it.

03:27:54.220 --> 03:27:55.020
I'll save it.

03:27:55.020 --> 03:27:55.740
All right.

03:27:55.740 --> 03:28:02.460
Uh, my final thought for the night is, um, candy canes are the best thing about Christmas.

03:28:03.260 --> 03:28:07.420
Candy canes are the best thing about Christmas and that new candy cane flavor at the pink

03:28:07.420 --> 03:28:07.920
berry.

03:28:08.940 --> 03:28:13.260
Actually, they do have peppermint, but dark soccer brought me a pumpkin candy cane before

03:28:13.260 --> 03:28:13.580
the show.

03:28:13.580 --> 03:28:14.700
It's like a giant one.

03:28:14.700 --> 03:28:16.540
I ate it all during the show.

03:28:17.580 --> 03:28:18.780
Cause I love food.

03:28:18.780 --> 03:28:20.140
You were done before the show.

03:28:20.140 --> 03:28:21.420
Actually, that was during Bobby.

03:28:21.420 --> 03:28:22.300
I love food.

03:28:22.300 --> 03:28:24.300
Did it really taste like pumpkin pie?

03:28:24.300 --> 03:28:25.020
It was good.

03:28:25.020 --> 03:28:25.180
Yeah.

03:28:25.180 --> 03:28:26.780
It tastes like, I offered to let you lick it.

03:28:27.340 --> 03:28:28.380
I don't want your cooties.

03:28:28.380 --> 03:28:30.300
You already gave me gay seven years ago.

03:28:31.100 --> 03:28:31.980
Remember that?

03:28:31.980 --> 03:28:32.940
Sorry about that.

03:28:32.940 --> 03:28:34.860
No, no, there's a story.

03:28:34.860 --> 03:28:35.180
All right.

03:28:35.180 --> 03:28:35.580
Quickly.

03:28:35.580 --> 03:28:36.860
Cause we got plenty of credits.

03:28:36.860 --> 03:28:41.420
We were at Goff land and they had these big Pepsi bong bone drink things.

03:28:41.420 --> 03:28:44.940
And so I let Rob have a sip of it and I said, I don't have cooties or anything.

03:28:44.940 --> 03:28:45.500
He's like, okay.

03:28:45.500 --> 03:28:46.460
And took a drink, passed it back.

03:28:46.460 --> 03:28:47.660
He goes, I have gay.

03:28:47.660 --> 03:28:50.940
I was like, and Irene was there and I was like, Oh my God, Irene, let's date.

03:28:54.060 --> 03:28:58.940
And for the rest of the day, you did kind of, she just shrugged.

03:28:58.940 --> 03:28:59.440
Maybe.

03:28:59.980 --> 03:29:00.380
All right.

03:29:00.380 --> 03:29:01.980
Uh, I know Irene's pretty cute.

03:29:01.980 --> 03:29:07.100
Uh, thank you guys again for downloading the show and checking it out.

03:29:07.100 --> 03:29:08.140
We really appreciate it.

03:29:08.140 --> 03:29:10.300
We'll be back to do this all again next week.

03:29:10.300 --> 03:29:12.300
Same bat time, same bat channel.

03:29:12.300 --> 03:29:14.700
Have a great week in your gaming, whatever it is you're playing.

03:29:14.700 --> 03:29:15.660
Just have fun.

03:29:15.660 --> 03:29:17.660
It is an exciting time to be a gamer.

03:29:17.660 --> 03:29:18.140
Good night.

03:29:18.860 --> 03:29:21.580
