Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Happy New Year! Well, Happy New Year to those of you listening to this in 2014. Tonight, we're still a few days away, and that means we still have to close out the year. Take a look back with us as we reminisce about 2013, and take your comments and calls on this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to the very last episode of Orange Lounge Radio. For the year 2013!

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Troll-old!

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Oh, why not? Travis was doing that joke last night on Understation Live. I thought I'd continue it tonight. Anyway, hi!

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
What do you think of it? We did it last year, too.

00:49.000 --> 01:05.000
We probably do it every year, but anyway, no, we're not going anywhere anytime soon, but the calendar is a-changin'. Welcome, everybody, to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio for this December the 29th of 2013, episode number 533 of our show.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me, as you already heard, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm gonna finish this dang puzzle.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
What are you playing right now?

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm playing Mii Plaza so I can get puzzle pieces since a certain somebody who also has this puzzle completed came in.

01:21.000 --> 01:35.000
Those puzzles, yes. That is kind of like my little crack addiction on the 3DS, like when I'm not playing a 3DS game or whatever. I like to do the little street passing, collecting the puzzles. You know what's really great for that now is Starbucks.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh yeah, I go to at least three different Starbucks a week now.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
And you get like six people at a time now.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Also, I'm gonna steal Alan. Thank you.

01:42.000 --> 01:52.000
Alan, by the way, just since it's not video, Alan brought some wine in for our celebratory last episode of the year. Thank you, Alan. We'll see Alan in Part B a little later.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Jam jar is not bad.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
This is okay.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
It's not as sweet as Frivolo.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Sorry, listeners. I know this is not great radio, but I have wine.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
We're having wine tasting.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
I'm having wine, so I'm just gonna sippy here on the wine.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Have wine and coffee.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
I don't know about that combination. All right, but anyway, while we sip away here on some wine, why don't we say hello via Skype? Say hello to Loki, everybody.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Hi.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Hey, Loki. How you doing?

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
I was doing pretty good until how many games I bought during the Steam sale. Not so much anymore.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
We were talking before the show a little bit, right after, between the Bobby call and then when we went live.

02:30.000 --> 02:39.000
You were asking us, how do you look up how much I've spent on the Steam sale? So you must have found it, and you sound really depressed now.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Well, I didn't buy all of these, because I got a couple gifted, but I have 30 new games.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh my god, that you just picked up during the sale?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Yes.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Wow. And out of those 30, Loki, how many have you actually played?

02:56.000 --> 03:08.000
A few, actually. I have played a few. But, see, here's the thing. Not all of them were from the Steam sale. Actually, there was one that was part of an indie bundle, and so, I mean, seven of those were...

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
I think, actually, the amount of money that I've spent, though, has been quite small, I mean, for 30 games.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
So you tend to buy the stuff that's like two bucks?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
That makes sense. I don't blame you. Well, have you played any of the 30 games that you've actually bought?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yes, I have.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
And what was your favorite out of what you've played so far?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
The Stanley Parable was pretty good.

03:31.000 --> 03:40.000
Yes, it is. Okay, did you get the two special endings? Where you go visit the other places?

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah, I got that ending. I've gotten all the endings, I think.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Don't spoil y'all, because I stopped to play it.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm about, I think, four away from beating from all of them, but you also get really random ones, too, so...

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 04:04.000
Well, Loki, the sale is through January 3rd. Are you gonna try to restrain yourself now, or is it still open season and you're gonna buy a bunch of stuff?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Well, here's the thing. I'm right now thinking of things to actually buy.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
I really want. That's the thing.

04:10.000 --> 04:21.000
Well, yeah, just as said in our chat room just now, because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blocko Show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
And 5th Dream in chat says, new sale is up, Loki. Get crackin'. That's right. It's 6 o'clock, so they just flipped over, so...

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And for anyone who's interested, I'm opening Normandy.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
And that's your Animal Crossing town, right?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yes.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
Has Duke Nukem gone up yet? I've seen it up for a vote, but I haven't seen it actually on sale yet, and I really want it on sale.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Um, I thought it was part of one of the Flash sales, but I don't remember.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
It might have been one of the ones I missed. If so, I'm gonna be really irked, because that's one of the games I wanted to get.

04:51.000 --> 05:01.000
But, Loki, thank you again for the $20 gift card you got me for the holidays. I used that to buy a bunch of trading cards and level myself up to 20.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
But then I crafted that badge for the snow season, or whatever, the snow winter sale badge.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
And I got an item in there that I sold for like 75 cents, so that paid for like 5 of the cards right there.

05:12.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah, the items I got were crap, so I ended up just selling all of them, because it was like, ooh, hey, a football manager background. Yeah, totally awesome.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Some addicting crap, though, all that stuff.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah, I got some good stuff on Steam, so I'll talk a little more about that later.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Ooh, I'm looking, it looks like the Flash sale right now. Stanley Parable, funny enough, you guys talk about that.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
And Bioshock Infinite, which I'm gonna talk about a little later, because I finally played it this week.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I need to play that.

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
Alright, but before we get to that talk, we also have to introduce here with us in studio, say hello to the voice of the show joining us over the season.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I guess this, it's been about three months now, or will be, by the time you're...

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
It sure feels like it.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
But we love having you here. Even though, you know, we've always kind of been three people, it's fun to mix things up a little while.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
And you do great, and you have a great voice. So we always love having here in the studio, Jason, everybody.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
That's me.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
How you doing?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I'm, uh, still in a bit of a rush, and I'm trying to get my heart rate back down.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Jason literally walked through the door as we were playing the opening song tonight.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
Uh, maybe a little bit before, but what's your excuse, young man? You were in the Bay Area.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
What's your excuse, young man? You have a curfew of 6 PM, and you got here at 6, don't you?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
No, I...

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Don't ever be a co-host on Hoard House, because you will get emails like that.

06:25.000 --> 06:37.000
I, uh, went to a Raiders game, versus Broncos in my defense. I went to a Raiders game with a co-worker of mine, and, uh, despite leaving early traffic and everything else, I just...

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
I timed it perfectly well, actually, all things considered.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So you did make it here.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
I did make it here.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
I'm sorry you had to suffer through watching the Raiders play. That's, uh, that's unfortunate.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
It was, um, it's actually my first ever, uh, game that I've been to in a stadium, football-wise.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
I've never been to... I've been... I went to the Mile High Stadium as a kid, but for a concert, uh, teenager.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
Um, but I don't think I've ever seen a football game, high school, college, like anything, in a venue before.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
So, it was nice to see. It was a good reminder to find out how hectic things are, especially in the Bay Area.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
It was fun. It was really interesting. It was really good being able to get out there and do that again.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You didn't get shot, or shot at.

07:18.000 --> 07:26.000
Uh, one of them, definitely not. The second one, well, there's a lot of bangs in the arena, but I don't think it was somebody firing a gun.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Uh, go to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. BlackWolf says,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Jason's excuse is identical to mine. That's right.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Football.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah, he plays in the football drumline in Atlanta, so, uh, exciting stuff.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
He says he did the show tonight in his uniform. That's how last minute it was.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
I was like, why don't you have a webcam, Bobby? That'd be hilarious.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
You know, you and I have seen our share of high school football games.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Oh, god, yes, me and the band.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
I went to an Alabama Auburn game, which anyone from Alabama, any part of the south will know how big the college football thing is.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
I fell asleep. I was so bored.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Uh, let's see, go into the chatroom as well at live.vognetwork.com.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
Mako asks some questions about Duke Nukem, saying, wait, Duke Nukem forever? Are you nuts?

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
I just want to clarify. Duke Nukem 3D.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
If I said forever, then I obviously overly misspoke, and what a faux pas. Duke Nukem 3D is what I'm waiting for.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
That was also my very first convention land game.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Nice.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Was Duke Nukem 3D, when you could do the voice macros and everything. That was awesome.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm sure I've told this story on the show before, but we used to play that in the college dorms, like, over the dial-up.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
Because, you know, all those little rooms, I mean, dorm rooms are tiny, right? But we'd all have our own phone number.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
So, I would play in my room, and then my best friend who lived next door to me would play Duke Nukem in his room.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And we would call each other over the phone and do that.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
And the bros in the dorm loved it, because they would, like, see where I'm at, and then, like, go run and tell him where I'm at, and then they'd run it over.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Talk about screen-lookers. Come on, that's just straight-up cheating.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
I know, what a bunch of gossipy bitches. Like, you don't think brosy straight guys can be gossipy bitches?

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Get Duke Nukem. Get Call of Duty in the mix, and we all understand that.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
No offense, but offense.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
I played... man, what were my early dial-up days? I remember a lot of Warcraft II.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
I know I played Shadow Warrior once or twice with a friend of mine. I feel like we had to have played Duke Nukem.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
There... some game of its ilk at the time. There was definitely another first-person shooter I played a couple times.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
For the life of me, I can't remember what it was.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
Tigerclaw in the chat room reminding us, I got Duke Nukem 3D when Good Old Games gave it away.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
God bless Good Old Games for giving that away. I actually got that too, so I'm very thankful about that.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
The reason why I also want it on Steam, but I want to get it on sale when it's only, like, three bucks,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
is because they have that multiplayer coming, which, you know, the Good Old Games one is great,

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
but it doesn't, like, they're trying to add to it for the Steam one, so that's what I'm trying to get in on.

09:55.000 --> 10:03.000
So, actually, clue me in on this, um, have we... has Duke Nukem multiplayer on PC not been a thing at all yet?

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
Like, in, of course, the modern remakes, DOSBox emulation, that kind of stuff.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Well, you should still be able to land it.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Because, like, Loki, do you know?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
It's just not easy.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah, this is not easy. It's not what he used to be.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I think, I mean, I don't know, I haven't messed with it.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
This dream says Duke Nukem gossipy bitches edition.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I was going to say that I played a Duke match not long ago, but now that I think about it,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
that was probably on Xbox 360 after I picked that up.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh, yeah, that was on.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
And, yeah, I guess, I guess games of those time were built for, like, IPX and NetBIOS

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
and all of this other ridiculous out-of-date nonsense that predates, you know,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
LAN parties in the stable way that they are now.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Well, as exciting as it is to talk about a 20-year-old game here on the program...

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
And 28-8 bod motives.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Hey, we love our retro games. That's, you know, part of what we're all about.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
But I want to kick off tonight with the topic that I'm sure a lot of your favorite podcasts

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
and websites and so forth are getting into on this slow news week

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
because it is a bit of a slow news week, you know.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
We had a pretty major holiday happen this past week

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
and, you know, things that people are celebrating, a lot of people traveling.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So there was not a lot of gaming news this week.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
We'll get to what there is in a moment,

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
but this is the time of year where a lot of people talk about what was your top games of the year.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
So I want to start that same conversation here at Orange Launch Radio,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
the top video games of 2013.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
But a very important difference, what we're trying to do here.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Here at Orange Launch Radio, we want to talk about our, or as the case may be,

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
your favorite games of 2013, meaning there are no right or wrong answers.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
We're not trying to say, this is the list and shut the hell up.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
We'll do that later in list list because that is where we do the scientific list and the way things are.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
But for this, this is just about, hey, these were my favorite

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
and so there's no right or wrong answers.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
So I just want to know, like, what were your favorite games of the year?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Chatters, if you want to play along, shout them out in the chat room.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Your one, two, and three, what were your top three games of 2013?

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
And to be honest, guys, they didn't have to be released in 2013.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
They could be any time if it was something you really got into this year

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
that made 2013 for you.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
So how about ladies first, just because I'm dying to know for DarkSakura,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
her top three games of the year.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
DarkSakura, what was your number three pick and why?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
My number three?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
I don't even know if it actually came out this year, but I'm going to say fractal anyway.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Fractal anyway?

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Fractal, make blooms not war, because that has been my crack.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
If ever, and I'll tell you, and I mentioned this before,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
if ever I need something to distract myself that will make my mind work,

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
especially work on a pattern, it's fractal.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
And I love the game. I am super hooked on it.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
And I, yeah, fractal. Fractal, make blooms not war.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
That is actually a game I got into a little bit when you sent that to me.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I did play a pretty good amount of time one night.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
It was a really kind of different puzzle.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
It reminds me of the old school games of life that were on the Commodore 64,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
and I'm not talking about the board game version with the wheel in the car with the pegs.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
I'm talking about, like, this dot will survive if surrounded by other dots,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
but not too many, then it will die.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
And you just see these really very pretty patterns that bloom from that.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
It was almost like that idea, like as a puzzler, was really cool.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Well, especially with the ambient music that plays in the background,

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
it's, I'm trying to think of the right way to phrase it.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah, that's it.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
This game is actually from 2010, believe it or not,

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
but it was offered as parts of bundles in 2012 and 2013,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
so it kind of came to more prevalence later.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Well, then I'll tell you what, I have a different game that came out this year.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And that's Legend of Zelda Link Between Worlds.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Ah, okay.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
Because it's fun, and I still haven't gotten past the second boss in the dungeon

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
because that one is always the one that got me in Link to the Past.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
But it's really fun, I love it, and the 3D makes me completely motion sick.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
So that will be my number three.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
But the 3D is really good, I gotta say.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
It is, but it still makes me motion sick.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
So I don't use it that often.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
It's actually very disorienting, especially when you're,

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
I love the switch in perspective when you jump from a higher plane to a lower plane.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Because the camera actually moves with you just a little bit.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
But otherwise, you know, I've been completely enjoying it.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
That game is definitely on my list.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Alright. Excellent.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Because I want to stick with stuff that came out this year.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Okay, fair enough.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Loki, what's your number three pick?

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
My number three pick is going to be probably, it's kind of a toss-up.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It almost sounds like a three-way tie for number three.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
We'll have a time to talk about honorable mentions later.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Okay, so let's see.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
I'll probably do, since I was gonna go by how long I played games,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
but let's do Saints Row IV, actually.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
Just because it was, you know, I like Saints Row, but it was a little bit of a disappointment

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
just because it seemed like it was kind of rushed.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
But I still enjoyed it.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
It's just, you know, it's frustrating that it, I know it, having played all of the entire series,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I know how good it could be.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
And it's disappointing to see that it didn't quite make it there,

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
mainly to where Saints Row II and III would have been.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
It had potential, so hopefully the next Saints Row that comes out will be much better,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
but yeah, it's still pretty good.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
Alright. And you did talk an awful lot about that game, all the good and the bad,

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
so it doesn't surprise me at all that that is in your top three.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Jason, I don't know if you were wanting to do this tonight.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I know you tend to play a lot more of the phone games and the classics,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
but do you have three games from this year?

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
Based off going, like, the only way I can really gauge it is going based off the kind of things

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
that I've been talking about a lot, and I think I've come up with a one, two, and three.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Okay.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
So, number three, I'm going to give to FTL, Faster Than the Light,

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
because I've not had, like, despite how much I complain about that game,

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be playing it.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
And it's, you know, it's not particularly puzzly, it's kind of Twitch action

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
because it's overriding theme more than anything else is management of individuals,

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
because the pathfinding, yeah, whatever, the attacking isn't exactly,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
you can drill down and make things a little bit more difficult

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
and a little bit more complicated and directed,

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
but it's just a good, I don't even want to call it a god sim,

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
it's really hard to pin down, but it's just a satisfying,

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
nearly mindless, but not if you don't want it to be kind of adventure game.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
You know, I need to check this game out.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
This is one of those games I've always been meaning to check out,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
especially because it's sort of like a roguelike,

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
but just to be clear, this game was released in September of 2012,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
but it doesn't, well, it really doesn't matter, because again,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
like, how many games, and you know, it's so funny,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
who was it on Twitter posted their top ten?

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
It was, who does Twisted Metal? David Jaff? Is that his name?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah, he does Twisted Metal. Loki.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Yeah, that's him. I don't know how to pronounce his last name.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
He posted, like, his top ten of the year, and Sonic Racing,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
the one that came out last year, technically, the one with Danica Packard,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Sonic All-Stars Adventure Racing, whatever was in his list,

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
and everybody was like, you idiot, that came out in 2012, boo!

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
But it's like, okay, but there's so many games,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
like, how big is your backlog, people?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Like, there's still games, like Stanley Parable, I just said,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I need to get around to playing that still.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I need less than 25% of my Steam library, so...

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Exactly. Mass Effect, I did not discover my love for until, like,

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
four years after the fact, so you know, these things happen,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
so I just want to make very clear, we're not trying to come up with, like,

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
some journalistic, this is the best of the best, it's no, you're free.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
These are our gaming years, and FTL definitely ranked up there quite quick.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I haven't played in a couple weeks, I need to change that.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
When we get that tweet that's like, why did Jason put a 2012 game on his list?

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm gonna go ballistic, I'm gonna say, weren't you listening?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Listen to all the other words, come on!

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
But you do remind me, I need to check that one out,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
as old as the game may be getting at this point.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
It's still quite fun, very fun.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
All right, very fun. I guess just me's left, right?

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Okay, my number three pick, my number three pick is Super Mario 3D World

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
on the Wii U, which is, god, the Mario games are damn near always,

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
like, rock solid games. I mean, there's a reason why people eat up

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
anything with Mario in the title, because, especially when it's, like,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
the main series games, the platformer games, they are almost always,

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
without fail, some of the best games to come out for the year.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
A few exceptions here and there.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
But Mario 3D World is by no means an exception,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
it is one of the best of the year.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
I did not know how a 3D game was gonna go over on the Wii U,

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
because, you know, it's not in 3D, but they made it work out very well.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
I love the return of the classic styles of Princess Peach and Luigi

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
and so forth from Super Mario 2.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
I think the level design is fantastic, and especially later on,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
it just gets brutal in some of the more secretive stages

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
that come up much later on.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
The game can just be damn near brutal,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
and it's an amazing amount of fun with friends as well.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
It's a game that Wii U badly needed, that's gonna move some consoles,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
and rightfully so. It is a must-have game on the Wii U,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and absolutely one of the best of the year.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
So Mario 3D World, my number 3 pick.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
Alright, let's get into, let's read some number 3s from our chat room.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
Degenerate Johnny says, Dead Space 3, Code Man, Borderlands 2,

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Tech 2030, Tomb Raider, let's see,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Dark Tetsuya, Unreal Tournament Game of the Year.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Found it at Goodwill over the summer and been playing the hell out of it.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
That works, that works.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Alright, there you go. Let's get into some number 2 picks.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Dark Sakura, your number 2 pick.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
The Stanley Parable.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
The Stanley Parable.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Because that game sort of snuck up on me,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
and I'll tell you how I heard about it.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It was actually through a parody.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Not really a parody, but it was a response to an email

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
that the game creator had about it.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
And so he had the narrator narrate the response and the letter

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
about this guy being a major douchebag who emailed about it.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I was like, why do you say Stanley so many times?

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Like, well the game is about Stanley and you'll blah, blah, blah.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
So anyway.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
So once I saw that I was like, okay, I have to play this game.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
So I downloaded it.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I paid full price for it on Steam at the time.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
It was worth it.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
I've totally enjoyed it and I try to sparse out my playing through it

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
because honestly I still get really motion sick with first person games.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
But I really just enjoyed the really bizarre sense of humor

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
that went into making it and I love the narrator.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
I just sort of, you know, tried to do stuff now to spite the narrator.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
And it's so fun.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
So the Stanley parable gets my number two.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
When you have like a little sarcastic antagonist slash protagonist

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
slash do I root for this bad guy or not type character

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
like you had in Portal for sure.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
I notice you tend to love those types as a lot of people do.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
So that doesn't surprise me at all.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
I like games that are mockeries of other things.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
I love, I'm a big fan of satire.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
And it seems to me that a great deal, I mean, well, hello, I like Homestuck.

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
But I mean I like anything that is both a satire and homage to a genre.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
So I've been having a good time with the Stanley parable.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
And I think that it's something that if you haven't played yet

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
you definitely need to play it.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Act Definitely in our chat room saying playing the Stanley parable

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
makes me kind of anxious.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
But it's so good.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
It really is good.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
It's such a great game.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
And that and I just want to send a message to

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
we should get the narrator from the Stanley parable to do a bumper for us.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
If they would, I would love that.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
That would be amazing for the VoG network.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
OrangeZoundsRadio asked me to do a bumper and I said, well, sure.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Excellent, excellent.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Who's up next? How about Loki?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Loki, what's your number two pick?

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
My number two is going to be Bioshock Infinite.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
It was a great game and had a lot of moments in it

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
where it was just very awe-inspiring, I guess.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
And the ending was, it was very satisfying, I guess.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
So definitely Bioshock Infinite for number two.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I like games that have moments.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
The very beginning, I mean, you don't even have to wait that long.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
Just, you know, within like the first two minutes it's just like,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
whoa, that's pretty powerful.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Well, I didn't want to get into my gaming week too much.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
I was going to say this for a little later,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
but I will say I did finally jump in and play Bioshock Infinite

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
for the first time this week.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I was lucky enough to get it as a gift on Steam and I was like,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
all right, it's about frickin' time I finally played this game.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
And I was blown away by the graphics.

23:03.000 --> 23:11.000
They are so good and the atmosphere of the Columbia is fantastic.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Like, you know, I played the first Bioshock and I was like,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
oh, this is all right and I see why people are into it.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
You know, the more the story unfolded and so forth.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
But this one just, not to be crass, but it had me by the balls

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
from the very beginning.

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
It was so good and the way the environment is

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
and all the things to look at and the story behind it.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Like, Dioshock, I think if you could handle the first person shooter,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I mean, it's unfortunate, you know, you have the sickness,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
but I think you'd be really into this too because there's so much of the lore.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I do have the sickness.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
The lore and the culture with it.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
No, I know I want to play it.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
I have it. I've had it for a while.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
So I definitely want to. It's just...

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
And there's some very uncomfortable things.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I know some of you guys have probably heard about the controversies

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
in the game and so forth.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
There's some very uncomfortable things in there about America's history.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
I'm from Alabama. I can deal with it.

24:00.000 --> 24:08.000
I know, but it's done in a very tasteful way for a story

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
that pushes it forward without it being, like, shocking,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
if that makes sense.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
It is shocking.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
It seemed really realistic to me.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
I mean, if you've ever looked at any photos from America's history,

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
or even not just America, but, you know, other places in the world,

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
it's something that it's very period-specific.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
So, unfortunately, it didn't make my top three,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
probably because I got into it too late in the year,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
but it would definitely be one of my honorable mentions

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
of a late ad to my list.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
But anyway, Loki, not to derail what you were saying,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
but it's just I had to get that out there that I played it this week,

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
and I was just so in love with it.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
It's great.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Okay. All right.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Do you have anything to add, Loki?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Nope.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
All right, then Jason, we'll go to you.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Jason, what is your number two pick?

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Continuing my trend of playing catch-up,

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
it was recently revealed to me that Borderlands 2 was 2012.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Fabulous powers weren't revealed to you the day you held off your sword?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I just don't remember that day.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I don't remember being at the store.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I don't remember where in the year it actually fell.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
All the DLC was this year.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Yeah, and that's actually what I'm basing this off of,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
is that I made a point a couple of episodes ago

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
back when the PS4 was coming out,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
or just after the Xbox One was out, one of the two close enough together.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
At any rate, one of the things that's been really interesting to me

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
is that because online is ubiquitous everywhere,

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
we are truly starting to see video game communities in the video game

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
and not fan forums and that kind of stuff

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
that has a very serious disconnect from the game.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
I keep wanting to say Bioshock, because we were going on and on about that,

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
and I want to play that too,

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
because Borderlands is multiplayer and has a lot of work put into it

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
to make sure that the experience of playing together is good,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
not to mention the randomness of the loot and the DLC

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
and the keys that SHiFT gives out

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
and everything else that's going into that game.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
There are a lot of video game communities,

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
but Borderlands 2 is the first one that I know of that's console-specific

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
that's putting in a lot of work into maintaining original content

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
and the health of that community at large.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Funny enough, you are not the only one to put in that game from last year.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
At your number two, I see Seattle in chat says his number two pick

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
is Borderlands 2 as well.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Long distance high five.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
There you go. Awesome.

26:31.000 --> 26:39.000
My number two pick is a game you've heard me talk a lot about on this program,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
but with good reason,

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
because it is absolutely one of the best of the year,

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
if not the past few years.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
The Lich King.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
No, close.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn is my number two pick for game of the year.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 was one of the most awful MMOs ever made.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
That is no secret.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
The fact that they were able to bring in a new producer

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
who has worked utter magic with this,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
because not only was he able to take,

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
not only did he make a great new MMO that was very competitive,

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
that had a lot of the great stuff that we love about World of Warcraft

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
and Guild Wars 2 and other MMOs that are out there on the market,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
but kind of put the Final Fantasy brand on that

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
and even push it forward a little bit.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
The fact that he was able to do all this and back the car into the spot,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
so to speak, of,

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
oh, but we've got to make sure 1.0 continues into this

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
and the things that everybody started at 1.0 have to carry over.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
That was a miracle in gaming that they did with that game.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
It is gorgeous to look at, it's fun to play,

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
and it is probably going to be one of the best MMOs of this decade,

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
because if you think about it,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
World of Warcraft still have a great love for that community.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I'll love that game.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I cancelled my account this week, I'm sorry to say,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
because I've been paying for two MMOs.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn is where it's at for me right now,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
and WoW is an eight-year-old game.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
End of an era.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Running on that engine.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
It is in a way, it is in a way.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
I don't even think the new expansion is going to be enough to make me want to go back.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
It's one of those, I'll check it out, but we'll see.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
I'm so excited about a lot of the stuff that's going on in Realm Reborn right now,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
especially with the latest patch and so forth.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
I think it is kind of the end of an era just as, and to be fair,

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
before the angry Blizzard mob comes at me with their pitchforks and torches,

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
just as when I left Final Fantasy XI to go to World of Warcraft,

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
that was the end of an era.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
This is what's next.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
The pendulum has swung, and now we're on the other side.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Did I mention the soundtrack is so flipping good?

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Unless you get tired of listening to the Chocobo music the whole time.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
I might have actually been playing Final Fantasy XIV right before this very show tonight,

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
and I was running a Titan kill, which those of you that have played the game know,

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
you have to kill the, I'm not even talking about the level 35 one,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I'm talking about the one at level 50.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Oh my god, oh my god, look at the YouTube of the fight.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
It's crazy.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
And the music is like this rock song that's like,

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
That's like death metal that plays in the background,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
and it's like, your heart is beating so fast.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
I know Alan could probably hear me from the other room,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
like every time I got hit with something I shouldn't have,

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
it's like, fuck, motherfucker, piece of shit, god damn it.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I have Tourette's or something sitting there playing this game,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
but I'm just like that into it.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I was playing with a fun group of people.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
Funny enough, Darlena, who's one of the hosts over on All Games of,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I'm going to mess up the name of the show, I'm so embarrassed,

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Cat and Fox, I think she's one of the hosts of that show,

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
I was playing with in a group and we were having a lot of fun,

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
and I helped one of their friends get a Titan weapon, or relic plus one,

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
so that was good.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
I was having some fun with Final Fantasy XI,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
I was changing up the music because you could kind of mod it a little bit

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
and add your own tracks and where different songs were.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
So I had Otherworld from Final Fantasy X as my fight theme the entire time,

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
or Smack My Bitch Up from Prodigy, depending on if it was a party or not.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And then what was it, for the Chocobo theme,

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
it was Falcor's music from Never Ending Story.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So that made the game even better.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
You kept wondering what would be the WoW killer for many years,

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
so do you feel that Final Fantasy XIV killed it or did WoW kill itself?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
I don't think WoW is dead by a long shot.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Are they hemorrhaging subscribers in a way? Yes.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
But are they still the biggest MMO four times over? Absolutely.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And there's still a great community over there.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I may be finally tired of the game, so in that regard,

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
yes, WoW is killing itself because it's not innovating fast enough.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
That's the problem, is that now everybody's sitting here going,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
We are done with Pandaria, we are ready for that next expansion.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Oh, you just announced it. Oh, it's going to come out in maybe six months.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
This is Blizzard's biggest problem right now,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
and I don't know if it's because they're spreading themselves out

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
amongst five games or whatever, but they're moving too slow.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
And I know Blizzard has a reputation of it will get out there when it's done,

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
and when we rush things, something like what happened with Diablo III will happen,

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
and I understand that, but you look at something like Hearthstone as well,

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Hearthstone is a great game. It is moving too slow.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Why is that game still in beta? Why?

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
They're still balancing things, really? It is moving too slow.

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
It is time to open up that beta and just launch the damn game.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
If you have to still balance some cards, is it really that big of an issue

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
because most MMOs out there still need fixing?

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
I think the game's in fine enough shape.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
And it's not even just MMOs.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
Blizzard's entire catalog is balanced once every month, basically.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
And this may just be the difference that ten years makes or whatever,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
where that whole mantra for Blizzard where it's like,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Oh, we'll just take time until it's right.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
I'm not saying don't take the time to get it right,

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
but I'm saying move a little faster, you guys. I'm sorry.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
That's the reality. They're not moving fast enough.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
I don't think anything's changed in that regard.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I think they still can take their time,

32:05.000 --> 32:13.000
because they have three solid IPs that are by no means close to danger.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Fair point, because does it work for Diablo? Yes.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
StarCraft? Yes. Hearthstone? Yes.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
A game where you're asking...

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I actually wasn't counting Hearthstone.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
You said it yourself. WoW is still strong.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
But between WoW, Diablo, and StarCraft, they are very healthy right now.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
It's strong, but it is losing steam.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
And the difference there is you are asking people to pay a monthly fee for World of Warcraft.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
And it's like...

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
And not only that, but then you nickel and dime them with the server changes,

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
which... I get it. Final Fantasy XIV does it too.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
They make their money or whatever.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
But I just think it's moving too slow.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Like, you want me to pay for eight months while I wait for an expansion?

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Like, no, I'll quit, and then maybe if the expansion is good, I'll come back at that point.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
That's the reality.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
By which you mean you will come back for at least a month to find out.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
For like a month, yeah, of course. Why not?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
More than that, we'll see.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
We'll see.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Alright, anyhow, moving on. Let's get to number one.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Number one!

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
That's right, Numero Uno.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
Dark Sakura, your number one pick for Game of the Year.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Animal Crossing.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Why am I not surprised?

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
I've played this game, like, addictive.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
It's so crazy.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I have friends that play with me.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Hayak Deft.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
You may have just had your town open during this very show.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
I did, and then it crashed on me, and Mr. Resetti showed up making a face at me, so whatever.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
But I love Animal Crossing.

33:37.000 --> 33:43.000
I think that they have found what works again, and it's become fun.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
You know, even Dan has a character. He still lives in a tent, but he has a character in my village.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
And I was thinking about it, too, that, you know, I've been using it to help Julian with his reading,

33:53.000 --> 33:59.000
and to bribe him into paying attention to other people, but it's got appeal for all ages.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
I really have been enjoying my game.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
I also may have finished my wine before you did. Like, all of it.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
It was really good.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Rob, wine!

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
No, I don't need any more, especially since I have to drive tonight.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
Yeah, there's one glass limit for her. I'm just slowly sipping away at this.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
We'll finish that bottle, don't worry.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Because Alan's here tonight. I don't have to pick him up.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Do you like the jam jar?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Yeah, this is good. I like this.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Because of my seal of approval.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
All right, number one from Loki, as if I have to ask.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
If it is not the game I'm thinking it is, I may have a heart attack and die, so let's see what happens.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Loki, your number one pick of the year.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
I want you to die, so yes, it is going to be Grand Theft Auto V.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Of course! Of course!

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I mean, what else would it be?

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
It's a great game and I love it.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
And they're still making it better.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
That's it. Grand Theft Auto V. Not a surprise.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
And if you want to know more about why Loki picked Grand Theft Auto V as his game of the year,

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
just go back to the previous 15 episodes of the show or so since the game came out.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
Basically? I was going to say exactly the same thing.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
Jason, numero uno, number one.

35:10.000 --> 35:16.000
If for no other reason than because of the last two weeks, definitely, certainly, completely, Rogue Legacy.

35:16.000 --> 35:22.000
I've been having, especially with the controller now, it was always a fun game on the keyboard.

35:22.000 --> 35:30.000
And I just kind of live for that adventure, random, twitch, roguelike, platformer,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
just all things together, the music and everything else.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I've been having so much fun with that game.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
Throw in a controller, I've been using the PS4 controller religiously like every day since I've started,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
since I got it and actually got it to work.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
It's been insane amounts of fun.

35:45.000 --> 35:51.000
And I'm thinking that when it's out on, I'm thinking when it's out on two systems that I don't have

35:51.000 --> 35:58.000
and one system back home that I'll get back to eventually, those being the PS Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4,

35:58.000 --> 36:05.000
I may buy it again because just to have the console experience from the ground up,

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
not to mention there's some very, very frustrating Mac bugs with Rogue Legacy.

36:09.000 --> 36:15.000
But besides the point, more specifically, I've had a conversation with a friend or two in the last couple of days.

36:15.000 --> 36:22.000
I kind of want to get a Vita for a number of reasons and that's basically PlayStation 1 classics

36:22.000 --> 36:27.000
and some of the newer games, being able to play them portably just seems like a worthy investment.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
And that's always what it is for me with consoles, rather with portables,

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
is that when I can play something anywhere, I love to be able to do so.

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
And Rogue Legacy may tip me into that purchase and so for that very reason, that's my number one pick,

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
hands down, of this year.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
And it actually came out this year.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
It sure did.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Yeah.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
It sure did. No, it's a great pick. It really is.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
I was listening to the show on the way up here, of course,

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
and I was listening to you and Bobby talking about it in the handoff.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
And like anything else, it kind of has that first little hurdle.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
Grinding pays off and this game doesn't stretch it out unreasonably.

37:06.000 --> 37:15.000
But it's actually coming around a second time because I'm at a point where I like to clear the entirety of the areas.

37:15.000 --> 37:21.000
I posted a screenshot to Steam two nights ago or something like that,

37:21.000 --> 37:28.000
that I finally, for the first time, accessed and cleared every single room in the castle and the forest.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
It is still the only time I've done that once and then I frickin' die in the tower of the third area

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
because things get really hard really quick.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
But things are moving along.

37:38.000 --> 37:46.000
I have retrieved every item from the Enchantress and I need to start buying them.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I'm in a good place right now.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
You're way further than I am, that's for sure.

37:50.000 --> 37:55.000
And it's just managing the upgrades and figuring out how I want to proceed from there.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
And finally taking on the third boss and holding my own for more than 30 seconds.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
But yeah, very fun game and so much fun.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
Awesome. My number one game of the year will probably not come as a huge surprise.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
And I mentioned on November 23rd, which was the day that the Xbox One came out,

38:14.000 --> 38:21.000
I said, isn't it funny that Nintendo today released two games that are damn near contenders for the game of the year.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
And sure enough, both those games released ended up in my top three.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
You had Super Mario 3D World at number three and The Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds at number one.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
Because that game is my fucking game of the year.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
And I think some of this is a little bit personal as well.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
I know that some big outlets put it in their number one to such controversy.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
But, you know, good for them because it's my number one too.

38:48.000 --> 38:56.000
And I'm going to tell you, the way that they took one of my top five retro favorites of all time period

38:56.000 --> 39:04.000
and brought it into not like a remake or even a reimagining, but just another story,

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
a chapter two in that game that you love.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
But now it's got all that new technology of the current console.

39:11.000 --> 39:19.000
Like the way that it moved seamlessly from Super Nintendo to 3DS is just, it's so right.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
And it feels so great to play.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
And I love some of the changes they made to it.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
I know some of the things were controversial where you rent the weapons now and you can do the dungeons in any order.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
But I think that's cool.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
And I think it makes for, you know, a different, a more Mega Man-esque Legend of Zelda, if you will.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
You know, it's something a little bit different, but it is such a fun adventure to play.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
And I loved every second of it that I've played it.

39:42.000 --> 39:50.000
And it is a Link to the Past wink for me that I loved.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
And I just, yeah, a fantastic game in my game of the year.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
For the record, you could actually do two of the levels in Link to the Past out of order.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
Yes, but, you know, weren't they numbered?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
They were.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
The little crystals were numbered.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
They were, but I always did five and six backwards.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I would do the water palace first.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
Alright, so there it is. Those are our three games of the year.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
But what about you guys? Take a look at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Locopoco says, number one, BlazBlue, Chronofantasma.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
I'm a fanboy who can't put the arcade stick down.

40:23.000 --> 40:29.000
Scottatron says, The Last of Us, hands down my game of the year, the game speaks for itself.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
Tech2030 says, Tales of Celia, for sure.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
I clocked in like 50 hours in that game and I'm about to go back in for a second time.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
Let's see, some other number ones here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
I think I got mixed in with the number twos here.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
There were a bunch of people that did theirs in bulk at the start of all the games.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Yeah, that's where I got to.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
Grand Theft Auto V, Degenerate Johnny says, Dark Souls.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
Codeman says, Super Mario 3D World.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
And Dark Tetsuya says, Super Mario 3D World.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
So there's a sampling of some of the answers there in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
Open forum for a minute. Honorable mentions.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
Some games that didn't make your top three, but they deserve a shout out here as well.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Jamie?

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
I'm going to say the stupid Pokemon.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
Just because it was the first ones that I actually wanted in a while.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
And I'm having fun with it so far. It's cute. It's Pokemon.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
I like roller skates.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
I don't like that every time you accidentally bump into a chair, you sit on it.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
But other than that, I'm not too frustrated with.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
And I also don't like the 50,007 Pikachus.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
57,000 Pikachus.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
But I wanted a Pikachu. That's the one that people want.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
So why not give it to them?

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
And then you see nothing but Pikachu for another year or so.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
True. And that's all that's in the world trade.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
Loki, you mentioned you were trying to decide between a few games there.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
What are your honorable mentions?

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
Let's see. Far Cry 3, Blood Dragon.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I just bought that.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
It looks pretty odd. Yeah.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
I bought that too and then I was like, ah, I have to do Uplay.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Ah, I forgot about that.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
And then, let's see. The Stanley Parable would probably be another one.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Um, I don't know. That's pretty much it.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Jason?

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
Because I couldn't find a place for it in the top three and just because it...

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
Despite how deep it goes, I'm kind of surprised that I bumped it into my top three.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
But considering everything I've talked about, obviously Papers, Please is the honorable mention that I would have loved to put in my top three.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
That's on my list and I hear so much good things about that game.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
It's...

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
I was gifted a copy of that too by a kind person.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
My Steam backlog is so big, I'm gonna cry.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Tears of joy, tears of joy.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It's a good problem to have.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
I have half my library. I can't even play because I don't have Mac ports.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
I have another game. Little Inferno.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
You were talking a lot about that game when it first came out. I remember that.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
I mean, it's worth a playthrough at least once.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
The combos are hilarious.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
But once you get past that, it's sort of weird.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
But it was really fun. I liked it.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Oh, and Limbo.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Limbo was fun.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
I just want to note for some honorable mentions I have as well.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I don't know if you have some extras, Jason.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
But some honorable mentions I have as well.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
I think the first half of this year was...

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
Usually the first half of the year is not as strong as it was this year.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
But we had some great games just in the first three months of this year.

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
But don't forget games like Ni No Kuni was a great RPG.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
As much as we have fun with Bobby Black Wolf, kind of teasing back and forth with that.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
Ni No Kuni was a great RPG. Beautiful style. Beautiful soundtrack to that.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
Great game. I love Ni No Kuni.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Bioshock Infinite would definitely be an honorable mention for me as well.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
We just talked about that a minute ago.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
Tomb Raider, which hasn't come up yet, but that game was phenomenal.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
And is making a lot of people's year-end list.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
And with good reason.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
It was so great to finally...

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
You play a game like Tomb Raider and you're like,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
Yes! This is the Tomb Raider I wanted to play.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Tomb Raider is definitely the most...

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
And it looks gorgeous.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
I'm kind of excited about the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One version.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
I mean, yes, it's a little weird to have a remake of a game that was just out.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
But at the same time, with even more power, I'm really excited to see what they're going to pull off.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I loved Tomb Raider.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I do need to add another one on my list too.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Skullgirls.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Oh, of course.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
For fighting games. That one was really fun.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Jason, any others? I didn't mean to cut you off a minute ago.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Hotline Miami.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Oh, good one.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Which I haven't put enough time into.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I just bought that for Dan because it was a dollar.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
More things to throw out in the chat room here.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Let's see, some honorable mentions.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
Dungeon Buster says, Metal Gear Solid Revengeance.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Tomb Raider.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
Tech 2030 says, Ni No Kuni, Tomb Raider, Crysis 3, BioShock Infinite.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
We're all first three months.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
That was crazy.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Siaos is Pokemon XY.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Steamworld Dig.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Team Fortress 2.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
There's still a lot of people.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Hey, there are still a lot of people playing that.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Awesome Unicorn.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Guacamelee.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Guacamelee is great fun.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
In Dark Soccer, you mentioned you just bought that.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
I did have money, but it was cheap.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
I'm waiting for it to be, for when I get my PlayStation 4.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
I believe that it might be Guacamelee.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
What did I say? Guacamole?

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Guacamelee.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Guacamelee.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Guacamelee.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Degenerate Johnny says, Shadowrun Returns and Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
There you go.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
SSJ 100 Matt, Don't Starve, Poker Night 2, Pokemon XY, and DuckTales Remastered.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Oh yeah.

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
DuckTales was, as much as the cut scene thing bothered me, it was still, the game was a lot of fun.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
And the new level was frustratingly hard.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
I have another game.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
That is definitely an honorable mention.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
The whole rest of that game wasn't?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Not really.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Vesuvius was crazy though.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
This is because of my heart.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Namco High.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
No, seriously.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
It's like such a, you know me in parodies and satires and tributes and things.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
I fucking love that game.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
It makes me laugh every time I play it.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
Just knowing the characters from the obscure Namco titles.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
And the homestuck characters in it and playing as the cousin of the prince of all cosmos.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
It's just so crazy that it's stupidly fun.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
Not quite enough to make it into my top three but definitely has a warm fuzzy place in my heart.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Alrighty.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Alright well good discussion.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Lots of great games.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
This is a very good year for games.

46:38.000 --> 46:45.000
And on top of that you get two new consoles and I'm sure they're gonna really start to roll out some of the heavy hitters next year and the year after.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
We already know that because of the delays unfortunately.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
Next year is going to be a great resurgence.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
I can't even say a resurgence for console gaming but that's the way that it feels.

46:55.000 --> 47:03.000
It's like everything has kind of been, you know, the late day, the late age games have been coming in at the mid and end of the year.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Literally the end of the console life.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Right.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
But next year is just gonna, there's gonna be a lot of heavy hitters really quick next year.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Oh yeah.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
It's gonna be all of our poor wallets collectively.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Yes.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
Well you know you have things and on Playstation 4 you have, what was that?

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
The Order, the one about the wolves and all that that looked really cool that they were shown at E3.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
And then you have Infamous Second Son is next year as well and you know there's a lot of great stuff on Playstation.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Drive Club.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Drive Club finally coming next year.

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
Xbox One has the Quantum Break which will, the new Halo you know is gonna be the holiday thing next year.

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
Lots of great things on there as well and then you know I'm sure the current gen consoles aren't stopping either.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
There's gonna be another Mass Effect.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
And then of course Nintendo on Planet Nintendo where they do things Nintendo's way.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
They will have Mario Kart 8 is gonna be huge.

47:53.000 --> 47:58.000
A lot of people theorizing they'll at least tease the next Zelda if it's not out next holiday.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
Smash Brothers will probably be a big holiday one for sure.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Absolutely.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
And who knows what else from Planet Nintendo.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
I expect that game to be more like mid year.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
There's no way they're gonna make it, they're gonna take it to holiday season next year.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
They got Mario Kart now.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
But maybe we should say predictions for later.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
Yeah perhaps. Well we do have 2014 predictions coming later.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
In an old segment we call Listless coming a little later on the show tonight.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
We haven't done that in a while.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
So stay tuned for part B.

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
But for now we're gonna get into the news after we do our gaming weeks.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
So stepping away from the games of the year a little bit just quickly.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
What have you been playing this week? What have you been getting into?

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I played some stuff.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
Animal Crossing and I played some Final Fantasy 14.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
And I got some of my old school friends into Final Fantasy 14.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
People from my Digimon days.

48:48.000 --> 48:54.000
And the stuff and words and other games.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
I bought a bunch of games that I haven't started.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I played some Fractal.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I played some Mass Effect 3.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
I played some Mass Effect 2.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Because basically I have a new computer.

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
Oh yeah. That was your holiday gift huh?

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
Not really the computer. The guts in it are new.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
The case. The motherboard. The processor.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
The only things that we carried over from my old computer were my graphics card.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
My power supply and my hard drive.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
Because I already have a 3TB external storage as well.

49:22.000 --> 49:29.000
So my new computer is pretty hardcore for me.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
It does what I want it to.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
So I made sure to upgrade the games that I really wanted to play.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
I've played some Skullgirls.

49:37.000 --> 49:43.000
I reinstalled Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age and I'm working on modding them right now.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
And Skyrim was in the middle of installing when I left the house.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Have fun with that.

49:49.000 --> 49:54.000
With my new processor and everything, the installs don't take long at all.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
Because first of all we have our own router.

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
So we get better speeds with our router and everything.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
And then my computer is so fast now.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
I love it.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
And then Dan just took all the old guts and threw together a new computer.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Because we had the extras.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
He's like, let's give this one to my mom.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
So that's what he said.

50:16.000 --> 50:21.000
So I've just been playing random things really.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
And more Namco high.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
Because that game is crack.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I think that's it.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Well, I bought a lot of things.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I played a few things this week.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
Actually, surprisingly enough, not Grand Theft Auto 5.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
And that's kind of surprising because they had their holiday thing where they had it snowing and everything.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
And just didn't get a chance to play it.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
It's buried under cores right now.

50:50.000 --> 50:56.000
I did play Duke Nukem Forever.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
And it was terrible, unfortunately.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
It kept crashing every single level.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
It would crash.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Every single level.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
So after about seven levels I said, fuck it.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
And I uninstalled the game. I'm done with it.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
It's not good in any way.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
It's just...

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
It's absolutely terrible.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
It's not what a Duke Nukem game should be.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
There's no point to it.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
It seems like they're more fascinated with, hey, what kind of interactive things can we make?

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
Alright, cool. Look, we made all these light switches and shit you can do that you don't really need to even mess with.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
And then the game's just very basic looking.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
It just looks old.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
I don't know how to really describe it beyond that.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Other things I played.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
I played a little bit of a brand new game I bought.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Now, it's an indie game.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
And it's kind of cool.

51:53.000 --> 52:02.000
It's a cross between almost like a 32nd hero and a shooter and the Oregon Trail.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
So you're in a wagon like the Oregon Trail.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
And it's like, day one, you've encountered some wildlife.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
You go hunting.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
And so your actual wagon is just shooting out bullets.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
And you have to kill these things and avoid hitting the animals and stuff.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
And you collect meat that way.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
It just keeps popping up different random little mini games almost.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
And it's just ridiculous.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
It's a lot of fun and pretty cheap.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
So I played that.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I played through the Stanley Parable.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
And quite a bit through that.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
I think I pretty much finished the game and I've gotten most of the achievements so far.

52:39.000 --> 52:48.000
Aside from some of the ridiculous ones like where you have to mod your date on your computer and stuff.

52:49.000 --> 52:58.000
And then, let's see, I played a little bit of Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
A little bit more of that. That was kind of fun.

53:01.000 --> 53:11.000
I tried Proteus, which is kind of a very retro looking 3D first person, I don't know, art game, I guess.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
There's not really a point to it.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
But I was just showing it to Josh because I wanted to show him a game that wasn't scary, I guess.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
So he dug that a bit.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
It was neat. I don't know. It's very short.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And I think actually that's it.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
Alright, sounds like you definitely were dipping into some of that stuff you bought on Steam.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
So you weren't wasting money.

53:35.000 --> 53:41.000
Yeah, I was going to say real quick I was just going to run down what I picked up from Steam.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
Uh oh. Well it is a 3 hour show.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
It'll be quick. It's only 30 games.

53:47.000 --> 54:00.000
Sequence, Dust and Elysian Tail, Bionic Commando, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, Don't Starve, Terraria, Left 4 Dead 2 because that was free,

54:00.000 --> 54:08.000
Operation Flashpoint Red River, Fuel, Overlord 2, Overlord, Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising,

54:08.000 --> 54:17.000
Clive Barker's Jericho, Damnation, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, Super Hexagon, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Rise of the Triad, the new one,

54:17.000 --> 54:28.000
Cube, Gateways, Drastic Man Epic, Half-Life Soars, Lamalana, Blockland, Ballpoint Universe, Infinite, Retrograde,

54:28.000 --> 54:38.000
In order to love 2D Evolution, Final Fantasy VII, The Stanley Preparable, The Orange Box, and finally, actually from last week, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Geez.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
That's a good haul.

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
And it was only 60 bucks. So averaging about 2 bucks a game.

54:48.000 --> 54:56.000
You know what? Considering that's the price of one new Xbox One or Playstation 4 game, that's doing really well for yourself.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
Hours and hours of entertainment, so why not? And supporting a lot of indie games in there too.

55:01.000 --> 55:07.000
Alright, my gaming week will be quick because I pretty much already talked about the big new one, which is Bioshock Infinite.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
If I may, I also did buy Dust.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Oh, did you?

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Yes, I did.

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
I did also play, besides just Bioshock Infinite, I did some virtual consoling on the Wii U.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
Because nobody told me that Legend of the Mystical Ninja had come out on the Wii U.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
That is like, even, okay.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
There's some of those games, like, I loved it when it was out on the Super Nintendo, like, originally.

55:29.000 --> 55:36.000
And I loved the fact that, you know, you had the little towns and you had the, like, minigames you could play in the towns.

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
By the way, one of which, Gradius, you can play Gradius in Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
It's a scaled-down version of it, but it's there.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
So, you know, I loved that game as a kid.

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
Playing it now in retrospect, I'm kind of like, this game was kind of derpy.

55:49.000 --> 55:55.000
But I adore it for its derpiness and for some of the things it tried to do.

55:55.000 --> 56:03.000
And, you know, I made a great Miiverse post that is right now the most popular post in the Legend of the Mystical Ninja community.

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
Which is, it was a screenshot of me playing Gradius, and I put,

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
Look guys, I'm playing a virtual console game inside my virtual console game.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
It's Virtual Consolception Horn.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
It's got, like, 25 likes, so, my Miiverse moment of fame.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
It's got 25, yeah!

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
Yes! Or whatever it's called, so that's fun.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
But yeah.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
How about 55, huh?

56:27.000 --> 56:36.000
Well, this is funny, because for the first time ever, I finally got the joke in the game where there's a quiz show game that you can play

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
where it asks you questions about the game in the first couple stages to see if you were paying attention.

56:41.000 --> 56:46.000
And one of the questions is, like, how many legs does the boss have?

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
And the answers are none, two, and 573.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
And for the longest time, you know, you think,

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
Oh, 573, that's silly, because that's a big number. Nothing has 573 legs.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
But now looking back, you're like,

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
Oh! Get it?

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
And, yeah. Which, if you didn't know,

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Thank you, Konami.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
573, in Japanese.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
If you abbreviate some things and kind of say a lot.

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
You have to kind of take some liberties, but it is konami, basically.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
It'd be go, nana, mi, mitsu.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
So, there you go.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
But yeah, you have to take some liberties, but that's why Konami's kind of always married with the number 573.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
So, there you go.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Let's see, I think that was about,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Oh, then I also played Castlevania.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
Because that came out on Virtual Console a few weeks ago, and I just never picked it up until now.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
And, yeah, between that, Bioshock Infinite, Final Fantasy XIV, that was a week.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
So, there you go.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Last but not least, Jason, your gaming week.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
Mine was pretty simple too, but I'm not nearly as expansive and elaborate as Rob's.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
So, it will take probably a quarter of the time, if not less than that.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
I also really like to talk, and I've been drinking, which makes me more rambly.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
You chatty bitch.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Yep.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
I sent out a couple more gifs right around Christmas for various members.

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
Ms. DDR Angel, friend of the show from many, many years ago.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Haven't heard much out of her, but I saw something on her wishlist.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Oh, I still talk to her. She's still around.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Oh, yeah.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
She's on Steam, and I just added her on 3DS a couple days ago.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
I don't know if she's an active listener anymore, because I think she's just kind of...

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Just not in the chat.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
But she does have a very neat blog called The Eco Maker.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Yes.

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
Do you check it out, people, because if you're into doing DIY things on the cheap?

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Uh-huh.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Well, they were...

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
And I don't think she would mind me repeating.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
They were having some hard times a few months ago, and so they were really thinking like,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
you know, how can we do something shortcutting?

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
So, a lot of great ideas in this blog on how to do it on the cheap.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
So, yeah. It's a good blog.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
Anyway.

58:39.000 --> 58:45.000
Amusingly enough, I don't even remember what I sent her, but there was something at a good deal,

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
and I saw that it was on her wishlist, so I jumped on it and sent it her way.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Speaking of which, she should open your present.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
I should open my present.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
A live unboxing. A live unpresenting.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
Apparently, I'm finding out that apparently roguelikes are my favorite game,

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
because Loki also sent me Super Wagon Adventure, which I need to actually play at some point,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
and I picked up Electronic Super Joy.

59:06.000 --> 59:12.000
Neither of those are being roguelikes, but I cracked open Doom RL, which is the Doom roguelike.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
Just kind of randomly crossed my mind this week, and I wanted to see how it's improved,

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
and it actually has graphics now.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Wait, Doom RL?

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Doom RL.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
I've never heard of this.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Doom roguelike.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
It's surprisingly fun.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
I'm a little sad that the levels are...

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
They're very roguelike instead of being very Doom-like,

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
and I mean that in like Classic Rogue and...

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Oh, Jesus.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
NetHack.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
All that kind of stuff.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Very classic, very boxy, and...

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
Yeah, it scales down the Doom textures and plays it again, but...

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
I don't know.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
Maybe I'll look in and see if I can make levels myself,

59:48.000 --> 59:53.000
because it'd be pretty cool to actually put homaged, if not straight up ported, Doom worlds into Doom RL.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
But obviously, considering that I just gave it number one, a lot more Rogue Legacy as well.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I think I got another 30 levels or some odd like that.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Levels basically map to how many upgrades you got,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
so a good heaping helping of ours in the last week.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
After I watched you streaming Super Hexagon, I tried that out for myself again,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
and it's strange.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I bought it on iOS some time ago, and I'm not terrible at it on iOS,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
but on a D-pad, I'm just abysmal.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
My records are barely 20, 30 seconds on any level and much less on the higher ones.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
No, those are really good scores.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
They really are.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
But I can beat 30 seconds relatively easy on iOS,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
and I think it's because, for what it's worth, the D-pads on Apple laptops are very small,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000
and so to play them with these micro-touches doesn't work very well where on iOS

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I just have to jam my finger onto one of the sides of the iPhone or iPad or what have you.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
But yeah, fun reminder.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Like I said, I played that game on iOS some time ago, and it was really fun.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Super Hexagon, Rogue Legacy, Doom RL, probably something else that I don't even recall at the moment.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I feel like I talked about it last week.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Definitely the continuing rogue-like week.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
That is a great week to have, as far as I'm concerned.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
It absolutely is.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I love me some roguelikes.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Real quick, I forgot. I went to Golf Land this week.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Oh no.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It's sad.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I looked at DDR and was like, what have they done to you?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah, it was bad. I didn't actually get to play any DDR, unfortunately.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I got to try out that Super Mario Kart arcade GP or whatever it is.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Worst idea ever is to have active commentary from some guy talking about the race.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I was like, why did they even add that? It was completely annoying the entire time.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And yeah, Golf Land is sad.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I think a lot of the arcades we used to love, it's so hard to go into them and see a sea of little kid gambling games.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
The ticket-spitting games. It's just so hard to see that.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Don't get Josh addicted to those.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Nah.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Alright.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Moving on, I think we are going to get into some news, but first some quick housekeeping.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R or you can also follow us on Facebook.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
We're also on Google Plus.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
We do tape live again Sunday nights at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG Network.com.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And we will be back.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I mean, we didn't end up having any time off for the holidays just because these Sundays fell on pretty good days this year.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
So we will be back again next week.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Still looking at the potential of doing a roadshow in a couple weeks, which will be very exciting because we haven't done one of those in a very long time.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
And I should be able to.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
So this is going to be very exciting.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:06.000
But unfortunately, Loki, it'll probably be right when the kid's here, but it'll work out for at least us to go hopefully hang with some of the old school friends at O-L-R and some of our friends in the Bay Area.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
So it'll be a very different type of episode. It'll be fun.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Cool.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Alright.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I just unwrapped my present.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Oh, what'd you get?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
A lot of foil, which I am now wearing as a hat. Why? Because I can.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
It's very pretty.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
It's very blue, flowery, something.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I want to feel cool.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I actually want to go get some more to do decoupage with it just because it's so pretty.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And then I got a ThinkGeek shirt that says, I am here because you broke something.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
And that's always been true, but now that it's my full-time job, yes, please.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
How appropriate.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah, at the moment I saw that I was like, yeah, that's for him.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Did you try to nick it off and then on again?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Well, now I need to get one of those because I'm going to be working in tech support.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Make me a hat with this foil.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Okay.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Alright, anyhow, get that foil off my head because I can't see the news otherwise, so let's get to the news.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Loki, start us off tonight.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Alright, so usually when we report these types of stories, it's normally EA shutting down servers,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
but this time around it's actually going to be Sony.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
They're going to be shutting down their online servers for a few of the PlayStation 3 games that they have.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Starting off with the course, Gran Turismo 5 is going to be having their servers turned off May 20th next year,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and Resistance, the entire franchise, going down on March 28th.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Also, as of January 28th, they're going to be shutting down the online connectivity for MAG,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:40.000
SOCOM Special Forces, and SOCOM Confrontation, and SOCOM Confrontation and MAG.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Those are online-only games, so if you bought those, you're fucked.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Your game is over.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I kind of get the Gran Turismo 5 because they're trying to nudge people onto Gran Turismo 6,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.000
and I'm sure there's newer SOCOM games as well, but MAG, I kind of thought there was an audience still out there for that.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I could be wrong, but I kind of thought MAG still had a little loyal following to it because it was really about massive groups of people, right?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I guess if they're not achieving that anymore, I certainly don't have these numbers to back them up either,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and I know I was interested in the game, never actually wound up picking it up,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:21.000
but a game like that, if its numbers are dwindling, if they're not able to match-make and keep the 4A,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.000
the massive number melee going on, then why keep supporting the game? Why keep putting the time and money into it?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Robert, I always think that you should have an offline component to at least do some sort of LAN or something,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
because you have something that's not just a coaster when this is done.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Right. Let's see, I'm looking here in chat and Robert M says,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I thought MAG had already shut down. Well, no, they're shutting it down January 28th, 2014.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:55.000
It's just that this was actually announced some time ago in July of 2013 that they were going to shut it down.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.000
So the news that it is shutting down is not necessarily new, but it is coming within the next few weeks.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Well, I guess folks have had six months to get used to the idea and try to sell the game second hand to an unsuspecting-

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
No, don't do that, that's mean, that's mean. It's the risk you take with online games.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:20.000
If you think about it, even Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft, they'll all shut down someday.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
It'll be a long way away, but they'll shut down someday.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
XI is still active, isn't it?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Oh yeah, very much.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And there's no time, no expectation for that to go away.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
No. A game like that will be around forever, you know?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:41.000
But at least something like that that's a PC game, there's a chance that someone may be able to run a third-party server or something like that after the game is shut down.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Whereas something like this that's on PlayStation 3, there's no chance for that at all. You're out of luck.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I mean, yeah, maybe you're not playing the game, but I still think that there should always be at least some sort of an offline component.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I agree with that aspect of it, if not an offline component, then a self-hosted game, a self-hosted server that you can run for nostalgia's sake.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Yeah, they did that when they shut down Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I wouldn't know.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Yeah, they did. They made it so that you could export your stuff and play on private servers, which is weird to see a company embrace that, but that was a really good thing, I think.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000
It helps aid the nostalgia and custom content and people that want to do whatever they want in the confines of their own system.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Like, what's the loss if something goes wrong? You're not liable for it anymore.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Maybe not to the letter of the law, but certainly with all practicality, this game's done. You're not affecting anybody else than the people that you invited to come play this game with you.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:48.000
But for nostalgia's sake, being able to continue to play the game, revisiting old gaming memories, that would be a good thing for MMO makers to adopt and continue to do.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:08:08.000
And considering, too, that eventually, I'm assuming, I don't know if they're going to carry on the SOCOM brand to PlayStation 4, but you might want to have some of that stuff still available to play so that people might know what SOCOM is when the PlayStation 4 version comes around.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Unless it is truly a franchise that they're going to sunset. I mean, we don't know. That could be happening.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:24.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Zon's Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, snowflake.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Well, we shall move on with some more news. Jason?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:42.000
This week, Notch just left a post-Christmas dump in your New Year's wishes and dreams in claiming that despite the build-out of Minecraft, that there are currently no plans for a Minecraft on the Wii U.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Which, not to jump on a presumption in Nintendo, but considering the age of their player base, having a productive game, like everybody is astonished when they find out that somebody building something in Minecraft is absurdly young.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:11.000
You know, they're seven, they're eight, maybe even younger than that. And the Wii gamepad gives you at least a little bit more flexibility than a standard controller would.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I know a lot of people that just stick their kids in front of a laptop or a desktop and let them go to work, but for something like this that's a little bit more accessible, this comes as a huge surprise to me.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Because kids that I know really seem to enjoy Minecraft, and so to not extend it, you know, there could be political reasons, there could be time and effort reasons, and there are supporting reasons and monetary reasons.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
It just seems like the Wii U would be a good expansive avenue for this, and to not take them up on that.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:54.000
It is so weird that they are resisting it, and it does seem political. I mean, not to be all tinfoil hat, but let's, you know, Dark Soccer did just give out some foil, so we have that part up.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It is not tinfoil, it's fake foil.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:05.000
But it at least gets us halfway to these conspiracy theories. No, but for real, like, you know, a map, duh, would be great on the Wii U gamepad.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I think just having your inventory screen and the crafting on the gamepad would make for a great experience. That's part of the biggest pain in the ass of Minecraft, is having to bring up the screen.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Where was I, man? You know, I think, oh my gosh, it would make so much sense on the Wii U, so it is very disappointing.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
That's why Nintendo won't do it, because it makes sense.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:31.000
It's return on investment is what it is. There's just not enough systems out there, and the people that buy games are just not there.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
That's a harsh reality. I wish they'd at least, if they're not going to do it on Wii U, at least look into some second screen stuff.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And maybe they will, with the PlayStation 4 and the Vita, who knows?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Or like a port to the 3DS.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Yeah, who knows? That's possible too.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Don't underestimate, though, guys, how huge Minecraft is with, like, kids. I'm always shocked.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Julian plays.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I'm always shocked at how many people I know with kids, and they're like, oh yeah, my kid plays Minecraft, and it probably needs not be said.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Not only just the kids. The whole freaking family!

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, for real. But I'm just saying, like, there are a ton of people that play Minecraft.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Like, it is pretty astounding what that game's accomplished.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:15.000
There's a buddy of mine that runs a private server and has, you know, Bucket and all the mods, and there's an IRC room that we congregate in,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:22.000
and so he runs a plugin that bridges the conversation in Minecraft back to IRC two-way.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And this wouldn't exist on a console, of course.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
But the expansiveness is what makes that game, and the game is built around expansion.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Or surviving, if you play survival, of course.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Or building stuff.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Expansion.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Like me.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Or digging holes. I get rid of stuff too.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:47.000
There is an immense amount of potential now, and I think last week we talked about, like, the long tail of Nintendo.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
There will not be an immediate return on investment, but it will happen because that game is popular.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
That is, you know, that would be a huge title to make its way to Nintendo.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But current plans, unfortunately, ain't gonna happen for the foreseeable future.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
You know, I had to really resist picking up the PlayStation 3 version, but it's like,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
dude, you own it on the 360 and you own it on the PC, and how much did you really play it on the PC?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000
But I've had this real bug to play Minecraft lately, so, Loki, we need to get that VoG server back.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Even if I've got a front of money for it, I think that we've got to make it happen.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
We can do it and you don't need a front of money for it. I just haven't gotten around.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I'll do it.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Yay! Alright, I'm excited.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:34.000
It doesn't have to... Even if you bomb the server and start new and maybe, like, as a, like, easy mode monsters thing,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
where, you know, there's some challenge or something against, I think that'd be great.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I backed up the server, because they brought back the server for, like, a few days and I was able to back it all up.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
But, you know, it's old now compared to, you know, the updates and everything.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And also, you know, free mode gets boring after a while, because there's no real point,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
especially when there's not a lot of people playing at the same time. That's why survival's kind of nice.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.000
See, my favorite thing was doing all the creative stuff, was digging holes and exploring, so I didn't really care about the other stuff.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Alright, and we've got some people in chat wanting to know when that's back up, so look forward to that.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Maybe that'll be something for 2014.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
But I do notice Robert M. in chat says,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I'm not planning on getting the PS3 Minecraft right now since,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
A, I'm too busy with the PC version in Pocket Edition,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and to some extent, B, the sound design isn't really there yet,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
with the menu making huge metallic clunks and barely being able to hear blocks being picked up.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Honestly, though, I'm going to tell you what stopped me from getting it on PlayStation 3,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
is that we haven't heard what's happening with PlayStation 4 and Vita versions yet,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000
and I want to wait and hear that, because will my PlayStation 3, is it going to be cross-play amongst all of them?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Because if so, fine, I'll invest the money in the PlayStation 3 version right now.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
But if it's not going to be cross-play and the PlayStation 4 is going to be different or whatever,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
then I'll probably just wait and get it on 4.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
It's going to be different on 4, I guarantee it,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000
because that's why right now the PlayStation 3 version is basically a port of the Xbox 360 one,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
so 4 and Xbox One are going to have larger maps and probably more features.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Alright, fair enough. Well, let's move on.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in the news?

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Well, Mass Effect stuff.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Yay!

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Well, as you guys know, on November 7th, which was N7 Day,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
we had a few tweets go in that showed some of the screens, not like full-on screenshots,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
but you could see computers in the background with a little bit here and there for the development of the next Mass Effect game.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:34.000
There was more news that came out by Aaron Flynn, who is the general manager of BioWare's Edmonton and Montreal studios,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
with just a photo of the computer that says BioWare.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And they're basically saying, and the tweet basically says,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Great time playing the next Mass Effect game in Montreal. Ambitious, beautiful, fresh, but recognizable and fun.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.000
So, and I'm, from what this is, it looks like it's just in the very early stages of level testing and design.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
What a fucking tease though.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I know.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I'm so excited and scared. Literally, I am Jesse Spano.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I'm so scared.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I am Jesse Spano in that scene when it was the new Mass Effect game.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I'm so excited. I'm so scared.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
But it's not going to be a Shepard story. I'm a little scared, but I'm really excited to play.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Think about it. We will get that trailer at E3.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
By six months from now, we will know about this game, Dar Sacro. Yes, we will.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I know.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And it might make it for the holidays, although I kind of think spring 2015 is a little more realistic,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
but you never know if they can play it now.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I'm still going to play it. I don't care.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I was very irritated with how more human-centric the last game went.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I would like to see more expansion into the other species in the Mass Effect universe, but I'll wait and see what happens.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I'm going to reserve my judgment until I've actually, you know, got it in front of me playing it.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
That's how I feel.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
That and it better have the same good multiplayer.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Right.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
That was pretty freaking awesome.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
At this point, you were talking about server shutdowns earlier in the show,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and I'm kind of surprised they haven't threatened to pull the plug on Mass Effect 3 yet,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
but I'm sure there's still a lot of people that play online.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Oh, heck yeah.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
But I don't know about, like, Wii U, but who knows?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:22.000
It was so borked on Wii U just with the whole Genesis thing, and you didn't get all of your options.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
It's just sad.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Honestly, if you're going to get it on any system, get it on the Xbox, because you can totally mod your files.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
If you have to get a console and not PC.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
If you have to get a console.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000
although I have a feeling there's not going to be much, but it's a part of the show we always do.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
So, Loki, how's the US look for release dates?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Nothing.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Nothing?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Nothing.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Not a damn thing coming out this week.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
You know, let's travel to Japan and take a look and see if anything's coming out there.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I kind of don't think so.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I was a little slow in bringing it up here, so sorry, guys.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
They still do not have PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, remember.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
That is coming out later.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Okay, Mafia 2 gets a price reduction, and there's some third-party game pads on the PlayStation 3 on December 31st.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
That's something, right?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
How about on the Xbox 360?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Okay, nothing on the Xbox 360.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
What about on the handhelds?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
How about on the Vita or the 3DS?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Nothing on the Vita.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And 3DS gets Puzzle and Dragons Z.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Oh, never mind.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Those are just decorative things.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So, is Puzzle and Dragons really big on 3DS over there?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
That's kind of weird.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Because I thought that I did not like the phone game at all.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
But I guess I know some people that are into it, so whatever makes you happy, I guess.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
It doesn't matter if there's something out there.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Someone's gonna like it and everyone else is gonna hate it.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
That's true.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Yeah, I'm looking at the other systems like the PSP and so forth.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Nada nada nada.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
So, nothing in Japan, really, this week except that one price reduction and some peripherals.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Dark soccer?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Jack and shit.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I figured.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
For the UK.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Yep.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Nothing.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Alright.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I'm sorry.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Fuck all.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Fuck all's coming out.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
You've got enough games to play right now is the moral of this story.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Steam!

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Release dates.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Absolutely nothing.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Alright.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Loki.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Alright.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So, unfortunately, one of the games I was actually looking forward to next year, No

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Man's Sky.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.000
The developer, Hello Games, suffered some flood damage over the week and it took out

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
some of their servers and PCs and stuff like that.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Monitors, furniture, a bunch of other stuff.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I'm not sure if that necessarily, obviously that might affect some of the development

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
of the game but they haven't really said that anything's been delayed yet.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I'm sure they have all that stuff backed up anyways.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And then also they're saying they're not really insured for the flood damage but hopefully

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
they may get some sort of help from Microsoft.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I guess they're saying Phil Spencer said he might be able to look into helping them

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
out.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I don't know.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
They'll see.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Maybe they'll do some funding stuff to recover some of the things that they had that need

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
to be replaced.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
It kind of sucks that they didn't have flood insurance.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I'm not really sure in the area that they're at if it's prone to flooding or if this

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
is just some freak thing.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It sucks either way.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I mean it's really unfortunate but these mother nature events or as they call them

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
acts of God or whatever, these things are going to happen.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Just a solemn reminder to have an emergency plan no matter who you are, what you do, what

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000
are you going to do if there's a fire or there's an earthquake or a tornado or whatever

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
it is where you live.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Always put your offices on the second floor.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Yeah, right.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Right.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
So, yeah.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Well, good luck to them though.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I hope they're able to make a recovery because that No Man's Sky did look very interesting

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000
even though for some reason it's the one game they didn't show on TV which was kind of shitty

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
but it was a good trailer.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Yeah.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
All right.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Ray Jinder says that games are like Pokemans.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
You got to get them all.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
No, you don't.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
You can't get them all.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
You can't.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
No, no, no, but you really don't need to because there are games that stink on ice.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
That's very true.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
We didn't talk about the worst games of the year but there's plenty of them.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
What, like Aliens, Colonial Marines?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
If they were worst games, I'd play them.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
You don't play bad games.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I don't waste my time with bad games.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
All right.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Well, I don't know if you guys heard over the holidays but all the networks online were

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
getting hammered.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
PlayStation Network shut down for an amount of time.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Xbox Live was down.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I don't think it was down quite as long as the others but it was down for a little bit

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
and Nintendo got hammered as well.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.000
And Nintendo, you know, very apologetic via their Facebook page saying the problem, the

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000
reason why Nintendo Network went down is because the influx of Nintendo Network accounts being

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
created and trying to get onto the eShop.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Well, okay, when you sell a 3DS with a eShop copy of a game that a lot of people want to

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
play, I mean...

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Translation.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Because of y'all greedy bitches.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I don't even think it's necessarily that they're greedy but it's just here we go again with

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:27.000
poor planning especially when it comes to network stuff and it's a bad trend for games.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Speaking of some of the worst games of the year, calling out SimCity.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Now, I personally am not calling it out because I'm going to be honest, I didn't play it but

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I was hearing about a bunch of the fuckery with that game and the online servers and

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
everything and, you know, we all know what that game went through and they didn't expect

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
the influx of people they were going to have and so forth and it really made people angry

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
that a game that they were used to being offline kind of had to be online.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Now, maybe a little bit apples to oranges is what I'm saying there because obviously

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
a 3DS does not require you to be online but Nintendo certainly took strides with their

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000
latest patch and by only bundling in the eShop version of some of these games on some of

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
their consoles, you know, they were kind of asking for it on Christmas Day so you kind

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
of look at something like this and you go, Nintendo, y'all got no one to blame but yourself.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You know, and your poor planning.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And also, I'm curious actually how many consoles they sold because, you know, if they didn't

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000
sell that many and they couldn't, you know, handle the influx of like, you know, a couple

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
thousand, you know, people then I'd be a little curious.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Yeah, but it's not just the Wii U Loki, it's the 3DS.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I understand that but, you know, come on, I mean, they know how many consoles they're

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
putting out.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Well, anyhow, the Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DS was taken down and last we heard it was

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
supposed to be back up 4 a.m. today.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I haven't checked to see if it was back up.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I think it is.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I've seen Miiverse has been pretty active and so forth so I think things are running

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
again over there.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
But yeah, that was not so great.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Also, kind of as a snowball effect, the Pokemon Bank was supposed to come out on December

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
27th.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.000
It was out and then it got pulled with no Western launch yet announced because this

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
was supposed to come out here as well.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And the Pokemon Bank was the new system where you were going to be able to take Pokemon

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
from X and Y and put them in the cloud.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000
This is how you were going to be able to transfer Pokemon to future games and, you know, no

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
matter what system Nintendo has Pokemon out on next, you'd be able to transfer things

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
through the cloud.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
So because of the network difficulties, they pulled the game because they wanted people

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
to stop trying to get the game.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
It's causing too much bandwidth.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Again, you should have known when you put all this shit out at once, something like

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
this would happen.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
So shame, shame.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
But for better or worse, they did delay this a little bit.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Your Pokemon in the cloud?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Nintendo used Fly.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
It wasn't very effective.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Womp, womp.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Fired!

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
All right.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Anyhow, if you want to try Pokemon Bank, you're supposed to be able to download until January

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
31st, 2014 and be able to download a 30-day trial and then it will be $5 a year.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And if you access the bank before September 30th of 2014, you'll get Celebi for free.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
So there you go.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
3,000 Pokemon can go in the bank and it will...

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Did you say Celebi-see?

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
No, Celebi.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Oh.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000
It will work with Pokemon Black, White, Black 2, White 2 through the Poke Transporter and

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
X and Y.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
So that's how you can get those generations in there as well and then whatever happens

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
next.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
So there you go.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
But unfortunately, we don't know when that will come out, but I'm assuming probably in

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
the first week of January is when they're going to push that back.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
And it will probably have a very quiet launch because they don't want everybody to hit it

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
at once.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
But once it hits the internet, open the floodgates!

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Fifth Dream in chat saying the Pokemons are clogging up our clouds.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Yeah, that is kind of what happened.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
It's like in Wall-E when the ship was trying to escape and it just blew through all of

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
the satellite data, all the satellites from it.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Right?

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane where you know what?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
You didn't have games in the cloud.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
It was right in front of your damn face.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Your head was still in the cloud, but the games weren't up there.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
That's right.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Maybe in this game, though, you were in the clouds.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I don't know.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Let's see.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
We're going to take a trip back to the classic game of the week.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Dark Sakura's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
you brats should play this game or I'll kill you.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I actually picked something a little on the obscure side.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I picked Ordine.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Ordine it is.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Which was a game put out by Namco.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Basically, I'm picking up the Namco games that were featured in Namco High because some

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
people have no idea where the fuck these games came from.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And I've actually done some of them for classic game.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:57.000
So I picked Ordine, which is basically you're in a little plane shooting shit down.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:06.000
And you have characters named Yuichiro Tomari, who is a scientist and the main protagonist

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
and you get a red ship.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
And then you get Sun Daichin, who is a Chinese assistant and the pilot of the green ship.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
You get Kana Ayahara, who is Tomari's fiance.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
You get Dr. Kubota, who is the main antagonist.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000
You get Miki-chan, who is a shopkeeper and Dream Company Limited, who is a robot who

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
flies around and helps you.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And basically, it's just a really cute little shooter.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
You get all the usual power-ups, you know.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And the thing about this is that it came out in 1988.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So it's one of those Namco System 2 hardware games.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
And it came out on PC Engine in 1989.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And it came out for the TurboGrafx in 1990.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
It's in the Namco Museum Volume 4.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And it has come out on the North American Virtual Console.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
So it's just a cute...

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It did?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Yes, it did.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Wow.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
It's just a cute little game.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I haven't played this ever.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
It was actually advertised as a comical shooter.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I gotta be honest.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
It looks a lot like Fantasy Zone.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
A lot, a lot like Fantasy Zone.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Yeah, it does.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
It has that same cartoony, cutesy style.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Now, the one thing about this, though, is that...

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
It's like a little shop.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
He just flew in the shop, like you do in Fantasy Zone.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Exactly, exactly.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
With this particular one, you basically...

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Like, for example, Miyuki-chan will stop by, like you were just saying.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:37.000
When Dream Company passes by, you can win crystals to buy weapons.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:43.000
But you have one-hit kills, but you can buy your extra lives as you go through the game.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
It's just a cutesy little game.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I mean, it was fun.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Not a whole bunch extra special to it.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Oh, they do like a little celebration dance when they clear the round.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.000
And I do believe that this is the one that Albatross was from in Namco High.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:06.000
So, whenever you guys see Albatross or Al-b-tross, as he is also known in that, this is the game he is from.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I'm going to double-check it, just to make sure, but I'm pretty sure that is it.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And that's your classic game.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
What's this? Some type of roulette game that's in there, too?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Like little gambling games?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Yeah, that's when you run into the robot.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Oh, okay.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Pretty cool. Alright.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I'm just double-checking.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I have to admit, I had never played this game before, but I kind of want to...

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I wish it was on one of the newer retro game collections so I could check it out.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
But there it is.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Your classic game of the week, boys and girls, or dine, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Good pick, Dark Soccer. I like it when you pick things I haven't heard of.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:44.000
And also, just to say, you know, again, if you haven't played Namco High, it's really fucking fun.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And it'll work on your phone because it is HTML5.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Alright.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I'm double-checking on the students one more time, just so I can be sure.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
And it's not loading up, so...

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Sorry. I'll probably be able to tell you guys soon.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Alright, well, maybe she can tell us after the break, because it is that time to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
But we've got plenty more show when we come back.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I was wrong. Albatross is from Rolling Thunder. I don't know what I was thinking.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Alright.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yes, there's not as much news tonight, so we're flying through that a little quickly.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
But we do still have the mailbag. We have the FUGL question of the week coming up.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
We have your phone calls a little later in the show.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And also, Listless tonight! It's been a long time.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
It was Tamari. I don't even know what I was thinking.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Because Albatross is from Rolling Thunder, and it's another of those weird Namco games, so...

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
My brain went fart.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Are you sure you're done? Because I'm trying to get us to break.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Yeah, it was Tamari. It was Tamari.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Listless. 2014 predictions. FUGL. FUs of the week. Twitter calls. Sure. We'll call Twitter. Why not?

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
We'll do it all here on the last episode of OLR.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Twitter call-outs.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
For 2013. Right after this.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.000
We are live with our last episode of 2013 for this Sunday, December 29th.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
And it is episode number 533 of our show, already in progress.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And a big hello to all of you guys there listening live at The Voice of Geeks Network.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Live.vognetwork.com.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:26.000
And those of you listening to us on the podcast feed as well, be it through, I don't know, iTunes Podcast, or Stitcher, or TuneIn, or any of those.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
A big hello to you guys as well.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Do remember, since those of you who listen on the podcast, there's a passphrase hidden somewhere in the show that you can punch into the website at vognetwork.com.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And if you want, you can use those points to enter the raffle.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
And you don't have much time left. In fact, if it's after January 1st, you already missed out for the month.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:54.000
But we're giving away a $20 gift card to many popular gaming services such as, you know, Nintendo Network and Xbox Live and so forth.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Why are we giving it away? Because we want you guys to visit vognetwork.com, of course.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And just because we love you guys for supporting the network and participating in the show.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
So it's us to give a little something back to you guys.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
So be sure to check that out over at vognetwork.com.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Also YouTube.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Yes. Jason, you've been working very hard on those YouTubes, I gotta say. And thank you for reminding me.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:23.000
We just put up last week, we just put, because YouTube is, again, YouTube runs one week behind, six days-ish, one week behind.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Just because we prefer to have folks listen via the places that really give us ratings instead of giving Google ratings, giving us ratings first.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
But then, you know, we like having it on YouTube for discovery purposes.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:42.000
And, starting with last week's episode, Jason, I don't know if you really plan on taking that level of effort every week, but I was very impressed.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:50.000
You kind of made it more of like an archive where you actually, like, bookmarked all the sections of the show and, like, very easy to find a part of the show you're looking for.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Some video synced up and things.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Well, the video is always gonna sync up, otherwise I just completely screwed something up.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:13.000
But, no, I want to start doing more and more, and basically, I finally sat down and did chapters, and it's, you know, every time I do this, I'm coming up with new ideas, and I'm going to take it as they come to me.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:21.000
It's like, you know what, we do the same thing. We've been on the air next year again, our twelfth broadcast year, tonight we're trying something new.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.000
You guys don't know what it is yet, we'll surprise you a little later, I'll tell you what it is, but we're doing something new tonight.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
It's just how you always kind of think, like, how can I do that, how can I take this one step?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And I've also, like I've said previously as well, I've also never done video work before, and it's always been an incredible interest to me.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:48.000
And so this is one part learning design, this is one part doing video editing, this is one part being able to do a lot of post-production.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Yeah, I'm contributing in ways that are very fun for me, and I plan to continue doing so and doing better each time.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Yeah, do what you love, that's why I do this. And you know, since it is that sappy time of year, since we're getting towards the end of the year, one thing I'm going to put out there,

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I got a pretty big promotion at work this year, which I'm very thankful for, I really like what I do for a living at my day job, and so forth,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:18.000
but part of the reason, and part of the stuff that played into that promotion that I got, was that it was recognized, some of the stuff I do outside of work,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:27.000
and that I work with audio and video and that type of production and things kind of outside of work, and that all plays into now, you know, what I do with my day job.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:34.000
So like, you know, all these years later, OLR has actually like helped me get a job in a way, it's so weird!

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:39.000
But I'm so thankful for it, and thank you guys for supporting it, absolutely.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I got a job too.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
That's right, you got a job as well.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I'm not going to say where I'm working.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Yes.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I'm glad that you actually know me in person, just because given the nature of the job, I don't really want to...

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Completely understand.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:01.000
But I will be doing some tech support, and that will be fun, but for every...

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And this is the thing that floored me, is that I just happened to put it on my Facebook like I normally do,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000
I'm so happy I got a job, 120 people.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I was like, how do I know that many people?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.000
So I want to thank everyone who supported me in my attempts to find gainful employment.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Thank you people who were just being happy for me, because that means a lot to me too.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:31.000
You know, just a lot of selfless people I want to thank, so thank you.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:39.000
And also listening to the break music makes me really want to watch Swing Girls again,

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
because Mexican Flyer is one of the songs they do for the finale.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
We played some Space Channel 5 music here live, which I can't repeat on the podcast,

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.000
and we would especially not own that on YouTube, we get a copyright shutdown.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Actually, I don't know if Mexican Flyer is back in the public domain.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Well, the Sega version definitely isn't.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Well, no, but it is big band swing music, which really brought that genre into the fore.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
So Actif says that we're happy because you're happy. Thank you.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And I got to give an arm of support to our buddy Brad over at Pod Culture,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
because he's job hunting right now and he's looking for something.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Well, it took me three years, so I hope it doesn't take you that long.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
But we are keeping our fingers and toes crossed for our friend Brad,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:30.000
and if you need a really smart guy who produces a solid podcast about sci-fi and geek culture

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
and a little bit of games and a little bit of everything, hire Brad. Absolutely.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I do have to say it was very encouraging when I took the small tour. TARDIS posters.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Oh, quickly. Since it is the voice of geeks network and people are talking not just video games,

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000
but did you watch The Doctor Who? I'm so behind on Doctor Who.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I haven't watched it yet, but someone spoiled The Regeneration for me.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
We all knew who the new Doctor was going to be and when it was going to happen.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I'm just expecting him to break out into a string of curses, as Peter Capaldi.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
But I did actually, though, I had to go back and watch the anniversary special while I was downloading it,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
just because, ah, David Tennant.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
That's on my list. While I game, I'm hoping that when we move and get our new place and our new office,

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
I'll be able to have a little TV so I can catch up on things like Doctor Who and stuff.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
You know, a little person who has the episodes on her hard drive.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
What's on Netflix too? This past season?

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I don't know about the most recent season, but I only got halfway through the ninth Doctor,

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
and it's not because I didn't like it. I loved it.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I have that box set. I need to get that back for my friend.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I don't watch hardly any TV. When I finished Orange is the New Black,

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
that was a miracle that I actually had the attention span to watch 13 hours worth of TV.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:54.000
At any rate, since I mentioned it, if nobody out there has seen Swing Girls, you can find it.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000
It's inexpensive now. Great little movie, and yes, it has subtitles.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000
But I just have to say, if you like the music in Space Channel 5, get into big band.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
There you go. There you go. Loki, you still there with us?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Nope, he took a breath. Oh no, he's there. Hey!

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000
It's so weird when I can't see you, but Loki Baby Watch is on,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
which is why Loki is on Skype with us for a few weeks here.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
But, Loki, any plans for the new year?

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
No, not really.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Since Josh dressed up like a firework for Halloween, is he excited about New Year's Eve,

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
or do you guys try not to get him too worked up about that?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Nah, he doesn't stand for any of that stuff. He doesn't know what's going on.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
He doesn't know, huh?

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
He has trouble figuring out what day it is during the day.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.000
He thinks when he goes down for a nap or something like that, that's another day.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And so he doesn't understand time right now.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Still young.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
You and the jokes need to stop.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I never will.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I know, I know. Alright.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
You want the intern Drew position here.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Alright, so next month they've got some pretty decent stuff on PlayStation Plus.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And I'm kind of excited about this in case you haven't played it yet.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Bioshock Infinite is going to be one of the titles they've given away free.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Devil May Cry, also Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And they're going to have some stuff for the Vita as well.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Smart As and Warms Battle Islands.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And Don't Starve will be available for PlayStation 4.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So, not bad.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I'm really curious to see Microsoft step it up for the Xbox, you know, Games with Gold thing.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Because it's kind of hard to compete with Bioshock Infinite and Devil May Cry.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Games that literally came out one year ago.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Yeah, Sony's kind of on a tear with their PlayStation Plus.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Not only their free games, but their discounts and everything too.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
They're making huge waves in this.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And, you know, especially considering as long as you purchase them, put them in your catalog,

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000
the ability to recall them later and play them in a later month is fantastic.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.000
There was the suggestions going around that even if you don't have a PS4 yet,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000
if you pick up, well, there's no free Plus titles for four, not retail.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
But if you are a Plus subscriber, even if you don't have the system,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.000
you can still buy it online and redownload it in the future, which is pretty damn fantastic.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:41.000
And I've been doing that even though I've been away from my PlayStation 3 for two, three months.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Yeah, so I'm looking forward to it and definitely recommend anyone that hasn't played Bioshock Infinite.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Definitely give it a try if you have PlayStation Plus. It's worth it.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And then the first round of Grand Theft Auto online jobs.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:09.000
These are created with the new Deathmatch and Race online creation tools that they released,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I think, literally a week or so ago.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
And so these are now Rockstar verified jobs.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:22.000
They have basically picked six races and four deathmatches that now will be kind of appearing everywhere online,

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000
like the official Rockstar matches. And so that's kind of cool.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
And they actually do have a system in there, as you may have seen,

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.000
with the actual official jobs where you can upvote or downvote or just not vote on different things.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
And based on those and the more popular ones, they will become verified,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
and you'll actually see them as part of the regular playlists and stuff.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
So I thought that was pretty cool.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I know it didn't bleed through, but tell me if I'm crazy.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
You two here in studio just heard that siren, didn't you?

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
The what?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
The siren?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
No.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
There was an emergency siren that just went hauling in three...

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Oh, in this neighborhood? I don't doubt it.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
It was just well-timed.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
A Grand Theft Auto story and the police are here?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Exactly.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Absolutely.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Works.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
All right.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Well, I got a couple stories for you guys.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Another story about Doom. What's up with this?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
It's like a blast from the past tonight with all this Doom story.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
But VXJ and XV, tell me if you've heard about this one.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000
There's a mod for Doom that puts...

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
A mod for Doom? No.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Yes, it puts Resident Evil 4's Mercenaries mode within Doom.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
That's cool.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
So there's actually a little video of this here that I'll play.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Sorry, Jason.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
It's very loud, but you see them going through the menu here,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.000
and it's got the Resident Evil 4 stuff in here.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Leon S. Kennedy.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
It looks like you can play as different characters there.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Leon's one of them.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Let's see there.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And for the chatters and podcast listeners...

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
That's right.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
You can go to youtube.com slash orangelandradio

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
and view the video that we were watching just now.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Not the best radio, but the video will exist in a week.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Just so you know, so you can have this.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
You do need a copy of Doom, and you have to have its multiplayer mods

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
in order to run this mod.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
It's only about 85% complete now.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Now we're finally getting into some gameplay there.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Oh, that's a very recognizable Doom.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
It's almost like they took Doom and made it over the shoulder.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Oh, he did the neck breaker.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Very Resident Evil 4 style.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Oh, yeah.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
With all the little pop-ups that come up at the bottom there.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
That's pretty cool.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I like that.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
So, yeah, he needs the multiplayer mods, and that's very awesome.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Where can you check that out?

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I need to...

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
It's linked in this article.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Yeah.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Was it?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
That's almost as cool as...

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
VigLink.com. It's like buried.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000
That is almost as cool as ASCII Quake.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000
It actually just goes to Mediafire, so it's literally just a no-name dump.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Yeah, somebody's hosting site there.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Well, just Google Domero.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
D-O-O-M. Doom Arrow.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
D-O-O-M-E-R-O, and you can find his immersive mod.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
That one's pretty cool.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Although, my favorite Doom mod to this day is still Gatchaman Doom.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
All right.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
So, yeah, check that out.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
All right.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Also, a quick story here.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Final Fantasy X-3.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
What?

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
That's right.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Not X-2, but X-3.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Hold on. Sit down.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Put your pants on.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
It's not confirmed.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:34.000
It's just that Kazushige Nojima, who was a scenario writer on the Final Fantasy series,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.000
he wants to see Final Fantasy X-3 and says it may happen if fans want it enough.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000
And this is from a book from the Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters,

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
because those just launched in Japan this week.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
We gotta wait for it for next year, but it is already out in Japan.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
And here's the quote.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Quote, if there's enough demand, then we may possibly see new developments.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I would personally like to see a sequel like X-3.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.000
So, I mean, we're gonna get a X-13-3 with Lightning Returns, so it's...

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
They just need to shut up and give us another 7 or something.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I'm gonna say the same thing.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Where's my damn 7?

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
What's your remake?

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I got a full immersive remake of 6.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Alright, well, if you want to show your support, March 18th is the big day

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
when these games come out in North America.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
If you're in Europe, you gotta wait just a couple more days.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000
March 21st.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
So check those out.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Oh, I was just saying that my villager wants to kill Ed.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
We had a message in chat from...

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Who doesn't?

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
They're talking about modding all the Doom stuff,

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000
and then Tech2030 says, seriously, Animal Crossing mod where the villager shoots everything?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And I said, my villager wants to kill Ed, because he won't leave my damn village.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I hate Ed.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And you've consistently hit him with bug nets.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Now I'm just ignoring him.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And I had him almost fully ignored and then accidentally talked to him.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Have you been writing him hateful notes?

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
You can't.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
If you want him to leave, you have to ignore him.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
And I'm like, I just want to murder him with my shovel.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Or embed the axe in his stupid horse head.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And then bury him with the shovel and see if he grows into an Ed tree.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
No, no, no.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.000
He's not even worth being fertilizer, okay?

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Or glue.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Or glue. Or even food.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Or jello.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
This is going to a dark place. Let's move on.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Super Punch Out!

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Ha ha ha.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Uppercut, uppercut.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Super Punch Out is on Nintendo eShop for Wii U.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
And you can get it.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
It came out in 1984 originally.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
And it came out on Virtual Console for the Wii in 2009.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:44.000
And now it's going to be on Wii U Virtual Console for 8 bucks.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I'd buy that for a dollar. Not really.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Well, if you bought it on Wii, then it will cost you just a dollar.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I think a dollar fifty gets a Super Nintendo.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Well, and also now for the PS3 people,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:01.000
there are two games coming out in Japan for PS3.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
That is going to be Raiden 4.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Oh my god. I'm so happy. I have to import that shit.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Because I love...

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:14.000
No, Dan and I were just listening to comparisons of the first Raiden game

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
on different consoles trying to listen to the music.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
And found some were really awful.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Did you know the Lynx version doesn't have any music?

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
And it's really terrible.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
And the other game coming out is Colladrius.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000
So, yeah. Raiden 4 is going to be Raiden Overkill.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000
And then Colladrius is going to be out in 2014 as well.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
So there you go.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Alrighty. Let's take a trip to our Foogle question of the week.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
You take Facebook and you take Google Plus

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
and you slam them together and you get Foogle.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
We're going to go over to our Facebook and Google Plus communities

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
where we're going to see some answers to our question,

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
which is very simple this week.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000
It's a holiday show for the last show of the year.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
So what is one very popular thing people like to do this time of year?

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
New Year's resolutions.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Which, you know, for better or worse, people do them.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
So we thought we'd ask our listeners,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
alright, it's the last show of 2013.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Do you have any gaming New Year's resolutions?

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Things you must do in 2014?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
For example, part of what I kind of thought of was the dark soccer on the show.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
It wasn't a resolution per se, but she came out and said,

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
you know what, I want to play one new game a week.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
And I thought, oh, that's a good thing to kind of aspire to.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I think I'm going to be using DVR as my interval training.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
So that's kind of your resolution in a way.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Yeah, I mean, I hate to use my whole exercise thing as a resolution,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.000
but I want to use DVR and other physical games as part of my training regimen.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Alright. Fair enough.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
So let's see what some of our listeners said.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Let's go over to Google+, where actdef said, get a better gaming PC.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Also, getting an HDTV is one of my top gaming priorities.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.000
But, of course, like every year, my top resolution is finishing my massive backlog of games.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Redertainment says, must accomplish project buy a house.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Now, I'm assuming that's not an Animal Crossing reference, but it very well could be.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
That's also on my list, too.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Actually, now that I'm going to be working, Dan and I are buying a house.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Moving to a nicer studio for OLR is definitely on top of my list.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
That could probably happen if we buy said house.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Well, it'll be a race.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Anyhow, let's go over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
We had quite a few answers over there, but I'm in a good mood.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000
We didn't have a lot of news tonight, so we should get through most of these.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Andy R. says, finish more of the games I buy. Damn Steam sales aren't helping.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Critical Myth says, resolve to finish Mass Effect 3.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Play the two Dragon Age games and do even more Assassin's Creed cosplay.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Only finish Mass Effect 3 if you have the extended cut DLC downloaded and ready to go.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Do it if you have it.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Even if you're like, but I want to see what it was like beforehand first.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
No, you don't want to.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
No, you don't.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
I made that mistake.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I watched them on the internet and I was like, download.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Exactly.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I waited to beat my game so I could download the extended cut.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
There you go.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
All right, going on to Fifth Dream.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I don't believe in making resolutions because I don't keep them.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.000
But if I did, it would be to stop hoarding games like a squirrel and his nuts in winter.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I seriously probably have more games right now than I've played only once or never than all the other games I've had in my life.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Sure, most cost $1.50 to $10, but still I have that same problem.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Same problem.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Degenerate Johnny says, I vow to catch them all this year.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Catch what, you might ask?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
I'll leave it to your imagination.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
You better have a good doctor.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
He means all the cards in Hearthstone, obviously.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Tech 2030 says, with a new Tales game and Tales HD rerelease coming out next year, I want to go back and play through all the Tales of English releases.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I'll get to replay the ones I finished and finally get to play through the ones sitting in my backlog.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Liam responded and said, to stop buying games I'm interested in on release at full price and I already have a stack of games to work through.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Instead, I'll wait for the price to drop.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Case in point, there's no way I'm spending 55 pounds on Tomb Raider Definitive Edition.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
It's euros, isn't it?

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000
No, euro is the little e with the...

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I need somebody culturally...

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Thank you.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Well, I lose.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Alright.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Our buddy Jeremy Jay from Koopa Club responded and said, my resolution is to finally play through all of the main series Dragon Quest and Warrior games.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.000
It's one of my favorite series, even though I've only played four of them with any seriousness.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
I need to do that someday, too.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Dragon Quest VIII on PlayStation 2 was so good.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
And who doesn't love the first one?

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Because we all got that strategy guide, right?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Good pick.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
And then you can replay the silver lining as well.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Flashback to three, four years ago, OR.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Alright.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
I actually put the symbols in chat because they do look rather similar at a glance.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Yeah, from far away, too.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Daniel S. replied and said, my gaming resolution is to stick to my game and not just jump from game to game.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Good luck.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
To do this, I vow to get at least three platinum trophies in 2014.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Codeman responds and says, I would really like to dive more into Final Fantasy XIV.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Took a little while off and now everybody has multiple 50s and it's crazy.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I may have gotten my second 50 this week.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I would just like to be more involved with a free company and run dungeons more, etc, etc.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Now just to find the time.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Well, you know what they say, real life greater than games.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Yeah, that's been my thing.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Well, I'm still only 30.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Clover, well, the good thing is that game has level syncing.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
So, Codeman and Dark Soccer and anybody else in our free company, I'm the Garsemer.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Just feel free to ask for help because everybody can level sync down and do stuff and it's still a challenge.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:06.000
And you get, if you have like a level 48 or 49 character, you get great XP from it still.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.000
I've actually been using the level syncing a lot for doing fates so that I can buy a stupid mount.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000
I'm still trying.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I had to get up to the job level so that I could buy my mount.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
You know who else has been playing Final Fantasy XIV?

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Bobby Blackwolf.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Bobby.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Bobby Blackwolf finally got into it.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
He hasn't talked much about it but he's playing.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Yeah.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Good times.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Alright.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Clover Nikon says, purchase a PlayStation 4 the latter half of 2014.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
My wife and I both agree that any issues should be ironed out by them.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Good luck.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
I want to get one too.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Hopefully a little sooner but we'll see.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Ragenator says, I don't really do New Year's resolutions.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
The closest thing to that is what I've been doing all along since this past March.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Buy more Steam games, preferably when they're on sale, and play more games.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Awesome Unicorn replied and said, my gaming resolution for 2014 is to ensure that no more of 50% of my playtime in Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII is spent recoloring and accessorizing Lightning's outfits.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
This will take all of my willpower.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:09.000
I really like that answer because the extras in Final Fantasy and how far they really go, that is such an appropriate answer.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Just in any game.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I probably sat there longer creating my character in Saints Row 3 than I did actually playing that first night.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I might be ashamed to say how much time I've killed in Super Mario 64, stretching Mario's face in weird ways.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
That's part of the fun.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Osfer replies and says, I must play Final Fantasy X HD or else I will probably cry.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Also hoping that XV is released in 2014 after we've waited for so damn long.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Sj100Matt is last and says, my gaming resolution is to actually make a classic gaming setup in my place.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000
I have the bulk of my classic gaming stuff in boxes and have to keep swapping them out when I want to play anything.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
What I would like is a full and nicely organized setup.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:57.000
It's a Retro N5? Or just Retro N? What was that thing you called?

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I call it the Retron 5 just because I love Tron.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I know it's cheating, but considering what you have to do to get enough inputs for classic games like that, not to mention if you don't even have composites.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000
And on top of that, a modern TV is going to have...

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:26.000
The way that we did ours at the old house was that we had the switch boxes behind with these demo monitors that Dan got when GameCrazy closed.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:33.000
And with our switch boxes and the component in, we were just able to hit the box in the middle and we had everything out on one shelf.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:44.000
There's another guy who has his setup to where he used crates with LED lights at the top of each crate so that it would turn on whatever system was active.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
And there's ways to do it. You have to get a little creative.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:53.000
But there are ways to organize it to where not only are your systems there ready to play, but they are also on display.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:02.000
It's a little foolish for me to jump straight to the retro end because compatibility, if nothing else...

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:10.000
The HDMI, like TigerClaw says in the chatroom, Retron 5 looks interesting. The fact you can play your old games over HDMI, that right there is so appealing to me.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Just the cable space and everything. I know it's not the same thing, but close enough.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Because of my emulation history and everything else, I would have no problem with something like that.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Not to mention, I don't own those classic systems anymore. I've given a lot of them away to various friends that don't need new gaming consoles and just want to play an old fun game.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:38.000
And so I've helped them along with that. Not to mention, the only system I owned before PlayStation was an SNES. But I have neither anymore.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.000
You want one? I think we have three. Or four.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Well, I think all my games went with it.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
We have extras.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I am not in the mood to start scavenging and building up and paying for all those cartridges again.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
We actually are probably going to be downsizing the vault, by the way.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
You want to move with all that stuff?

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Yeah. A good two-thirds of it is in storage at Dan's mom's house.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000
I have a quarter of a wall of a vault over there.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:15.000
One of the stacks sits at the ceiling. The stacks of components, cables, controllers. Yeah.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Amazing, though.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000
All right. Let's see. So that was pretty much all of our answers.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:27.000
So there's nothing left to read, but still, join our Facebook community and Google Plus communities and answer future questions.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:40.000
All right. Let's get into some more news and then we'll get into list lists and all that in just a little bit.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Loki, you want to start us off?

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So like most console games, now Battlefield 4 has been banned in China and probably has a little bit to do with the China Rising expansion.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000
They say that it was banned for national security reasons.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000
So I don't know. Maybe they just didn't like the view of China in that game.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Well, do you think it's one of those games where EA might want to put out like a different version to try or just know they're just going to write it off?

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I think they're going to write it off.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
I kind of think so too.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Because basically the main problem with it is that they're saying that the campaign of that takes place, you know, a Chinese admiral is planning to overthrow the government.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:35.000
You know, that's something that they really want to, you know, promote or glorify there.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Very, very true.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Do games have similar scenarios with just the legit like American government?

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:51.000
It's usually like, you know, you're taking out a terrorist faction that already did the deed of overthrowing the government or, you know, like future post-apocalyptic, something like that.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I'm thinking like Modern Warfare 2 and 3, that kind of stuff.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:05.000
There's always like some sort of corrupt government entity in any of these, you know, especially a lot of the military first person shooters and stuff.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Yeah. Always some kind of a nefarious, what's the word, ne'er-do-well that is the actual focal point of all of this kind of stuff.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Alright, well moving on to a game that's hopefully a little less controversial.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Dragon Quest XI. No, it hasn't been announced yet. Sit down.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Dragon Quest X, if you forgot, is an MMO game that exists on the Wii U.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:35.000
I guess that's one of the games in the Dragon Quest series our friend on Facebook would not be able to play yet because I don't believe it ever came out here in America.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000
It was only on Japan.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
But some people still talking about Dragon Quest XI.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Now, I guess there was some thought that Dragon Quest XI could be mobile, that it could end up being a mobile game.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I mean, after all, Square has been putting out more and more stuff on the iPhone, iPad, iOS system and Android and so forth.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:59.000
You know, like Final Fantasy 3, 4, 5 are all there. I think 6 actually just is coming out or just came out.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:05.000
I kind of stopped downloading all those because they're a little bit pricey and, you know, they're not as good as the originals.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
But some folks thinking that Dragon Quest XI might go that way.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:17.000
But Square Enix mobile developer Takehiro Ando would like to clarify some things in a Fumitsu column saying, quote,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:22.000
At the current stage, there are no talks about making Dragon Quest XI for smartphones.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I believe there's still plenty left to overcome before we release a proper sequel for smartphones.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
So we don't know when Dragon Quest XI will be out or what system it will be on.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I would guess PlayStation 4, but that's a huge question mark and so we'll see what happens with that.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000
But it does not sound like it will be on mobile phones.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Part of this, by the way, the reason why people think Dragon Quest XI could be on mobile phones,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
I guess there is a version of Dragon Quest X that is coming to mobile phones.

01:59:53.000 --> 02:00:00.000
I can't imagine it nearly matches the experience of Dragon Quest X on, like, Wii U or something.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
And again, you'd be surprised how...

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:06.000
It was originally on Wii, now that I think about it. Wii U was like a special version. It was originally on Wii.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:09.000
You'd be surprised how well some of this stuff can do mobily.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:15.000
There's a fair number of MOBAs and MMOs and they find ways of making it work.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:21.000
You know, input schemes that people are willing to put up with to play on their favorite franchise.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Alright, Darsakura, what do you have for us?

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Chatting about classic consoles, actually.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
What a surprise.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.000
But, speaking of classics, and we did bring this up before a few weeks ago,

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000
but there's been an update because the BBC is now paying attention to it.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
That internet archive thing that's putting the 70s and 80s games online,

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.000
the collection is including the Atari 2600, the ColecoVision,

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
but the games don't yet have sound, however they will.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:57.000
And, like I said, the BBC is covering this now because the archive apparently is expanding.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
What kind of cool stuff can I play in there?

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Well, the worry is that some of these are going to be illegal because they're ROMs.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
You have to have the emulator to play them.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000
But the much older games are supposed to be available for legal play

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.000
and it's not actually listing a specific type.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Okay, there we go. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Frogger are in the archives.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000
They are also including Atari's 7800, Magnavox Odyssey,

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
which in Europe was the Philips video pack G7000, and the Astrocade.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
There you go.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Yeah, it's expanded.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Alright, well, from the classics to the future, you guys,

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:47.000
it's time to predict 2014 in a segment we call here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Listless!

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Alright, and, of course, as the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:00.000
you guys listening live play an important role in the Listless process.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000
So head on over to live.vognetwork.com so you can play along with us.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Those of you listening on the podcast, I'm sorry we don't yet have the functionality for the podcast,

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000
listeners should participate too, but that is something we are working on for 2014.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.000
So listen along and have fun with us as we predict tonight's question,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000
what will happen in gaming in 2014?

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000
What are your gaming predictions for 2014?

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Now to take a walk down memory lane real quick,

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000
let me see if I can pull this up real quick because we actually have,

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
I don't know if you guys know this, but there's an Orange Lounge Radio Wikipedia.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Did you guys know that? There's a Wikipedia,

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
and we actually aren't even involved in it.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
I mean, we're on it, obviously, because of OLR,

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
but some of our awesome listeners,

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
like I know Orange Wright does a lot of this,

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Tetsuya does, and I know I'm leaving a ton of people out,

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
but they actually, if you wonder,

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
why do they keep talking about ferrets on the show?

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
What is the inside joke?

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000
You can check that out, orangeloungeradio.wiki.com.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Midna found the ferret, by the way.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Did she?

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Yes.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Well, one of the pages there on the Wikipedia is Listless,

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:10.000
and it tells you every definitive list we've ever come up with here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
because this is a process where we will come up with the definitive list.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:19.000
And so last year, at this time, we did 2013 predictions.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
So shall I remind you about what we predicted for 2013?

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Do it.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
The number one answer was...

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Oh, shoot, I just lost it. Damn it.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Sorry, guys.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000
The unfortunate thing about orangeloungeradio.wiki

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.000
is that it has some unfortunate full-screen ads that get in the way.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Here we go.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000
No PlayStation 4 was the number one answer.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Accurate.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Oops.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Well, none of us bought it.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
No PlayStation 4 for the show. That much is very true.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000
And then there was a three-way tie for second place.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.000
It was the Xbox lube is $100 with commitment.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:59.000
A Vita price drop before the first anniversary, which that did happen, right?

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
That did happen.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
And then Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
So we were one for four.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
There we go.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Instead of the Xbox lube being $100 with commitment, it's $100 more.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
With dementia and brainwashing.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Hey, there's the voice of Alan Alchemy who's gonna be sitting in on Listless with us tonight.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Hi, Alan. How are you?

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
What?

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
What a good introduction there.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
All right, I had to fade the music there a little earlier

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.000
because I don't want YouTube saying, oh, you don't own that song.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000
So there we go.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
All right, getting into Listless tonight.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000
For those of you that have never heard Listless before, it is a very scientific process.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:37.000
And there is no arguing, people, with this list.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Okay, this is the list of predictions for 2014, the official gaming community predictions.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Each host and guest participating tonight will go around and give their top three answers for what should go on the list.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Then, in a very difficult round, we will go around and each take one item off of the list,

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000
which then you guys, the chatters, can vote on.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And you will vote for your number one and your number two answers.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000
And then we will have ourselves a definitive list.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
So let's put it up on the board.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Here we go over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
What are your gaming predictions for 2014?

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Participating tonight with us, of course, DarkSakura, Loki, VX JasonXV, the voice of the show, myself,

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000
and Alan Alchemy, as you just heard there a minute ago.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Which, by the way, how are you, Alan?

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
What have you been playing these days?

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
What does a gaming week look like for you these days?

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Lots of Final Fantasy XIV.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Yeah?

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
What have you been accomplishing in that game?

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
I'm working on my relic.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Working on your relic?

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Yeah.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
This big number has been getting bigger.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
That's right. Big numbers getting bigger.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Monsters getting bigger.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Fights getting crazier.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
All right.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
All right.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000
So if you are logged in, you do have to be a logged in participant over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
But, of course, we don't ask for your money. It's free.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
We don't spam you or any of that shit.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000
So check that out over at vognetwork.com.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.000
And you guys in the chat can shout out your answers because we may use some of them here on the show,

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.000
especially as answers get stolen because sometimes there's duplicate answers and so forth.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
So as we did before, ladies first.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:14.000
DarkSakura, what is your number three pick for gaming prediction for 2014?

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Serious or silly? Whatever you want.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
World of Warcraft loses over a million subscribers over the course of 2014.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000
So WoW loses a million more.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Over.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000
A minimum of a million subscribers over the course of 2014.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Okay. And why do you say that?

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Because it's shit.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.000
No.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Come on. Don't hate on WoW. There's still a lot of friends I have that play.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
I still like WoW.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:46.000
I just don't think that the new expansion, even with as much as it kind of had me excited, I don't think it's enough to save it.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
It's too little, too late. They're just throwing bones now.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000
And, yeah, they may get a few lore nerds back and happy.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
And I'm a lore nerd.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000
How many of those books are on my shelves, you know?

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000
And I would probably, you know, play for a week to see the content and then quit again.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000
So it's just not enough for me.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
All right. So there it is up on the board.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
WoW loses one million subs over the year.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
All right. Let's go to Loki with your number three answer.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Loki, your 2014 prediction. What will happen in 2014, Loki, per your crystal ball?

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:31.000
I would say after Mario Kart 8 fails to sell enough consoles for Nintendo, and I'm talking about the Wii, of course, that they will finally drop the price.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Stolen one already.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
You were thinking the same thing?

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Oh, absolutely.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000
You guys, maybe not for that reason, but a price drop is going to happen just because.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
You guys are in, like, super pessimist.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Oh, OK. So you think a price drop is inevitable for the Wii?

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:51.000
I think Mario Kart 8 is going to do fucking fantastic, but I think a price drop is going to happen.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Yeah, that's my thing too. I also think Mario Kart 8 is going to do really well.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.000
But why do you think it's going to fail? You just think it's going to fail because there's not going to be the Wii U's out there or whatever?

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I think it's just, it can still be a good game, but it's just not going to be enough for people to buy the console for.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I mean, some people might, but it's just not going to be enough to make a huge enough difference to where, you know, all of a sudden it's going to be a 3DS.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Well, it's a good thing we have an elimination round.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:20.000
The question is, am I being meaner by saying that it's going to drop anyways as compared to Loki?

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:26.000
No, because I do think it will drop in price. I mean, all the consoles will drop in price next holiday. They all will.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
And the Wii U will be two years old next year.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Yeah, so, but we'll see. So there it is. I'm going to put it on the board anyway. Mario Kart 8 fails. Wii U price dropped.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Jason, I know you just said he jacked one of your answers, but I got to pick on you now. Number 3, what's your number 3 answer?

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Half Life 3 question mark, smiley face, frowny face won't get released.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Half Life 3 question mark, smiley face won't get released.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Won't get released, which is kind of vague because that allows for an announcement.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Or do you think 2014 is going to be a complete information void toilet for Half Life 3 still?

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
I mean, it already has been.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Hasn't it always been?

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:16.000
I don't expect it to change, but I'm going to stick squarely with no Half Life 3.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Okay, so there it is up on the board. Half Life 3 won't get released up on the board next to duh and of course.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Alright, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. Alright, my number 3 answer, I'll go next with my number 3 answer.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:37.000
My number 3 answer, and I know I'm going to have like two of you guys going, God damn it, that's what I picked.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:43.000
My number 3 answer is Ouya Goes Under. Ouya calls it a day.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I just, I think it's...

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
You went there?

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I went there, I'm sorry, but it's just one of those things that had a huge fanfare and now it's kind of went pfft.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000
And you know, I realize they're doing great things for indies and all that, but I just...

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
But Ouya 2, Rob, Ouya 2.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Yeah, Ouya 2 soon, so...

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I'm sticking to it. Take it off if you don't agree. Ouya Goes Under. And so I'm going to put that up on the board.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.000
These are some really real talk topics happening here.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:18.000
This is a gamershateeverything.com edition. Come on, guys. Cheer it up a little bit.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Happy faces. Talk about what you do like.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Alright, they're going to lose a million subs and then they're going to fail and you're still not going to get your damn game and then the company's going to go under.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Alright, Alan, maybe you have a cheerful number 3 answer or maybe you don't, but what is your number 3 answer?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Actually, you pointing that out made me think of something really dark and grim that I wasn't going to say previously.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
So, whether or not I say it is...

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it. Who wants Alan to go there?

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Go there, go there, go there.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:52.000
One of the big Nintendo godfathers of gaming will pass away.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Stop, that is too soon. No, you can't say that.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Yes, he can.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:03.000
The Zelda Mario dude, one of them. The Final Fantasy, one of the big 8-bit godfathers.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
You are awful and you should feel awful.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.000
They're all like pushing 70, right?

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
That's not very old anymore.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Well, it's true, but people fall downstairs every day.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
At least, let's hope that none of them get hit by a car like what's-his-face.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
This is supposed to be a funny segment, you guys.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I wouldn't have thought of it if you didn't point it out.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
I'm going to need...

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Sarah!

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I need everybody to eliminate number three answers.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Wouldn't falling downstairs be kind of ironic in the whole Paul Walker ironic?

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Because, you know, they do have to climb stairs at the very end of each Mario level to jump on the goalpost.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:43.000
No, it would be ironic if he gets kidnapped by a monkey and taken to the top of a skyrise.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
That would be ironic.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Alright.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
So I'm going to need us all to...

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Let's try to make it a little bit happier.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Go on to number two and then we'll just eliminate all the threes.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Alright.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Alright, let's try again.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Your number two...

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:04.000
So far, since I have to read it anyway, the super dark 2014 gaming crash number two predictions list.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Wow! loses a million subs over the year.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Mario Kart 8 fails. Wii U price drop.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Half-Life 3 won't get released.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Ouya goes under and 8-bit godfather passes.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Alright.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Let's go on to the number two happy shiny answers.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Dark Sakura.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Dark Sakura.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Stop influencing me.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Alright.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Dark Sakura.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000
What is your number two answer?

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
There will be another huge shipping war on Tumblr based on screenshots for the next Mass Effect.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:35.000
When people are shipping background characters, there will be shipping on screencaps.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000
And remind us if you do not know what shipping means.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Relationships.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.000
People fucking.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Those are two very different things, actually.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
It's fan-driven.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Okay, there is a big annoyance I have with just, oh, these two characters are friends.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000
They're fucking.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
No, they might not be fucking.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000
But anyway.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.000
But no, it's basically the shipping is going to happen based on screencaptures.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000
People are going to make assumptions.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Tumblr is going to piss themselves and ship all the things.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
So Dark Sakura is number two answer.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
The internet will exist is up on the board.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
No, no, no.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Rule 34 will continue.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Mass Effect 4 will be shipped before it ships.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I guess I should really change that to say new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
We'll change that answer a little bit there and alter that on the board.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Alright, Loki, dare I ask, your number two answer.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Hey, I actually don't have a negative one this time.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:40.000
I was going to say Left for Dead 3 and Source 2 will be out next year.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
There it is.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Left for Dead 3 and Source 2 makes its way out next year.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Seems logical.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Why not?

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:53.000
It's going to be really weird when like L4D4, Left for Dead 4 comes out just because numbers.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:14:02.000
The thought was because when they announced Portal 2, they made Portal 1 free to download temporarily.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Same with Left for Dead 2 just happened where they made it free for a day just to build up the game.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Just to build up the user base of it.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.000
So, most likely an announcement will be coming soon for that.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I've theorized previously that Left for Dead 3 and Source 2 running for a year will be the testing,

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:28.000
putting the toe in the water that Valve needs to make any sort of announcement on Half-Life 3.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Nope.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Announcement?

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Alright.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.000
We did have that conversation.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
But that's not even an entry.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000
That's just...

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
No, that's fine.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
That's fine.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Besides, it's not your turn.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Jason, what is your number 2 answer?

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I'm personally ready for L4D20.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Sorry.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Anyways.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Oculus Rift released, 4K resolution.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:57.000
As opposed to their current expectation, which is 128800?

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:05.000
I was going to say, we know Oculus Rift is coming, but you say Oculus Rift is going to blow something away with resolution and quality and not just current expectations.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
It is real fucking life, y'all.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Pretty much.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Oculus Rift.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Real fucking life.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Alright.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Fair enough.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
There it is.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Up on the board.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Alright.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:20.000
That is so funny that you bring up the Oculus Rift, and it is really funny because also in chat, we had SSJ100Matt says,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
One of the big three will announce an Oculus Rift type of device.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Well, funny enough, I swear I have this written before the show tonight, but my number 2 answer?

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Microsoft jacks the Rift.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000
What does Microsoft love to do?

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.000
They are going to take an idea that's popular in gaming and improve on it best they can.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
I fully expect Microsoft to jack the Rift.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I'm not sure improve is the case either.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Why not buy Oculus Rift?

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Because for Microsoft to fit that MO perfectly, they usually absorb the technology that they're going to remove.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Oh, they better not sell.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.000
That would be horrendous.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Since it is a dark edition of Listless tonight, I'm going to go to a darker place and say Microsoft's just going to flat up steal it.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I mean, they'll do something, you know, obviously there's trademarks and they can't just steal it.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:10.000
So, they'll put their own spin on it, but I'm going to say it's, I peg Microsoft does it, and they're going to, it'll be part of the one.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:16.000
So, it'll be the, not the Rift, but the, you know, the Shift.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
I don't know.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000
I got nothing.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000
But Microsoft jacks the Rift is my number 2 answer, and I'm putting it up on the board.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Alright.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Alan Alchemy, last but not least, with your number 2 answer.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Nintendo finally brings DS, not 3DS, but DS ROMs to a store on the Wii U, and somehow they make it disappointing.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I love how you had to tack on the, and it's disappointing, just to keep it dark.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Whether it be the price or the games that they actually announce for it or how it plays, they'll do it and it'll somehow still be stupid.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Alright.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Again, another dark answer tonight.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Womp womp.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Alright, there it is, your number 2 answer.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Alright, let's run through the board real quick.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:15.000
We have new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war, WoW loses a million subs over the year, Left 4 Dead 3 in Source 2 is out, Mario Kart 8 fails and the Wii U price is dropped,

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Oculus Rift released in 4K resolution, Half Life 3 won't get released, Microsoft jacks the Rift,

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Ouya goes under, Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints, 8-bit Godfather passes.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Alright, now it is time for the number 1 answer, the thing you most predict for 2014.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
DarkSakura, what is your number 1 prediction?

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:43.000
I've actually been drawing a blank the entire time.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:52.000
I mean, so I am going to say that an innovation within the video game industry leads to new advances for people with disabilities.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Like maybe Vision for the Blind, they're already working on bionic ocular implants, those are a legit thing now.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Maybe they're working on bionic oculus rift plans.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.000
I need to knock this shit off real fast, I'm sorry.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:21.000
So an unknown innovation in the video game industry leads to advances for the disabled, I had to shorten that a little bit.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:28.000
We're already seeing it happen, so I think that something really big is going to happen that's going to turn around a lot of the negative press.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Let's hope. Loki, did you have something to add to that?

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Oh, I was just telling Jason to stop it.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Alright, well shut them up with your number 1 answer, Loki. What is the number 1 prediction for 2014?

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:53.000
I've only been saying this the entire year, but I'm hoping that they'll do this because they'll definitely beef up what they have available for the system.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:19:03.000
3DS games on the Wii U, using the gamepad as the bottom screen, TV as the top screen.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:10.000
So you're going to just one-up what Alan said and say 3DS games on the Wii U.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Well, I've been seeing it all year long. It's an inevitability.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Fair enough. You can put what you want. There it is, Loki's up on the board with 3DS games on the Wii U.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.000
He did leave out the point, though, that it disappoints, for what it's worth.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Alright, so there it is, Loki's number 1 answer. Jason, we're over to you. What is your number 1 prediction?

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Jesus. Let's go with...

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Indie game released to such fanfare, they get signed on to a major publisher for a AAA release.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:53.000
The release doesn't have to happen, but the groundswell and fanfare has to happen in 2014.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Indie game signed on to produce AAA port of the same game.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:07.000
I'm going to try to shorten that to say indie goes from indie to AAA in the scope of a year.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
That works. Makes sense.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:15.000
I'm going to say indie game and put that on the board. Any idea what that type of game could be?

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
A good one.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
If you knew it, you'd be a millionaire.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Alright, you'd be a millionaire.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Bochikawa says, so like what happened with Portal? Something like that, right?

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Well, yeah, that actually was kind of it because it was that Narbacular drop.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Alright, my number 1 answer. Here it is, it's a long one. I don't know how I'm going to shorten this for the board, but here it is.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:47.000
My number 1 answer. In 2014, the year of Captain Falcon, F-Zero U is announced.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.000
It's the greatest game ever made and we, you haters, can shove it.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Falcon Punch.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
That is my number 1 answer. Falcon Punch.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
F-Zero Boner Party.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
That's how you condense that down.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Okay. That works. Nintendo's year of Captain Falcon.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
That's what they're going to call it. F-Zero Boner Party.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Nintendo's year of Falcon Punch.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Nintendo's year of Falcon Boner.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:17.000
I will accept that shortening. Nintendo's year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Fair enough. I like it. It is up on the board as my number 1 answer.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Alright, that means we are down to one more prediction to go up on the board.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Just before we hear Alan's answer, some of the things we see in chat.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Tech 2030 says Nintendo comes out with a 3DS player peripheral for the Wii U.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:43.000
5th Dream says a Final Fantasy XIV expansion. Game Guru says 2014, the year we predict disappointments in gaming.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Tiger Claw says in 2014, Gabe Newell will announce the release date for the Half-Life movie.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Degenerate Johnny says Nintendo pulls a Disney and starts buying up purchasable third party LPs.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Yeah, IPs maybe.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
I think he was saying Let's Plays.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Oh, I got it.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Degenerate Johnny says Hearthstone will remain in beta throughout the whole year.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Womp, womp, womp.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.000
I like the SSJ100 nets. I'm going to get thrown out next year.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
You already got thrown out last week.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
That's exactly what I said.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
But it can happen again in 2014.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Alan, there is one spot left on the list. What do you put in there as your number 1 prediction?

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Bethesda confirms and gives an ETA for either the next campaign Elder Scrolls game or Fallout 4.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:35.000
That's too wide of a net. Which one?

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Fallout 4. We've been waiting longer for that.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
So Bethesda confirms Fallout 4.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
And gives an ETA.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
And gives an ETA.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Wasn't there an article about that in the last week or two?

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Sounds awfully familiar for some reason.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Yeah, it's going to be probably out in October.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Oh yeah, I'm sure that's a good one. I think that's an E3 given. Absolutely.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Alright, that's alright.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.000
So here it is. Here it is, you guys. Here's what the board says right now.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
New Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
WoW loses 1 million subs over the year.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
3DS games on the Wii U.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Mario Kart 8 fails and Wii U prices dropped.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Indie game goes from Indie to Triple A in the scope of a year.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Oculus Rift released with a 4K resolution.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Half Life 3 won't get released.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Microsoft jacks the Rift.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Ouya goes under. Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives ETA.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
And 8-bit Godfather passes.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I got a name from Microsoft's Rift.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
What? The Jacked.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Be quiet. Alright.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
I thought that was a really good name.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Because you're jacked into the game.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:48.000
But you know, that is so opening it up to

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:51.000
I'm going to get jacked on my X-bone, you guys.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Yeah, I'm jacking my X-bone.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Duh. Duh.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Alright. Thanks for leading me to the joke that I was already at.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Here we go. A lot of these answers coming off the list tonight.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Because there's five of us. But that's the way it works.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Remember, we have a new rule for 2013 that will carry on into next year.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000
When a host loses two answers, their remaining answer gets immunity.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
So think before you eliminate.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:16.000
So Dark Sakura, you get to eliminate any one of these you want off the board.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I'm not going to say it's not worthy of the list.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
But I just want to be a little bit less morbid.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.000
And I'm sorry, Alan, but I'm going to take off the 8-fit godfather.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
So nobody else has to.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000
I kind of thought that was going to go.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
To be fair...

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Even though it's probably going to happen.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
We brought it on ourselves.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
He said it was going to be dark.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
And we made him do it.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I honestly think it's going to happen.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
So I'm going to take it off.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Well, it is stricken from the list.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
So we don't have to talk about it anymore.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Lee, you're up next.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
I don't know if you can see the board there over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
But which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Only because it doesn't really make any sense to me.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
It just seems very uninteresting.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
New Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Oh, new Mass Effect.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Well, to be fair, of course that's going to happen.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
She's not wrong.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I know I'm not wrong.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
That's a guarantee.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
It's too safe a prediction.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
And we're too edgy here at OLR for that.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
So it is stricken from the list.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
All right, fair enough.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Jason, it's a tough job, but that's what we do here at OLR.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Oculus only has one C, by the way.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
That's okay.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Will you strike something from the list?

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000
You want me to strike that C?

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.000
I'm striking a letter from the list.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:37.000
You're striking a letter.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
All right, it has been stricken from the list.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Oh, my goodness.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
That letter has been stricken from the list.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Shit, there are two very, very good ones.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.000
And which one do I think is less likely of the two?

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:51.000
I'm going to toss out 3DS games on the Wii U.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Oh, 3DS games on the Wii U.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.000
You're going to stick with Alan's more morbid prediction

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.000
that it's just the regular DS and it disappoints.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I don't think either one of them has the 3DS plays DS titles,

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:09.000
but definitely not 3DS games on the Wii U, unfortunately.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
I would love it. Ain't going to happen.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
All right, so it is stricken from the list.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Loki loses 3DS games on the Wii U.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Gone's gone.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000
All right, my turn.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
I get to take something off the list.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000
I am going to remove from the list.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Sorry, Loki, but I'm coming for you.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.000
You knew I was going to take this one off.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I'm taking off Mario Kart 8 fails and the Wii U price drop.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
I think, again, just like the Mass Effect thing,

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:34.000
that's too safe of a prediction.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Of course, the Wii U price is going to drop,

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
and I don't think Mario Kart 8 will fail.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000
I think it'll be the second-based game on the console next to Mario 3D World.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
So sorry, Loki, but it is stricken from the list.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.000
But that does mean Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 coming out,

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.000
that gets immunity, and Alan may not remove it from the list.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.000
So, Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Like a panicked engineer with a crowbar in his hand,

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Half-Life 3 won't get released.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
It's gone.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
You are not allowing that to happen.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
All right, fair enough.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Sorry, Jason, but again, too safe, Jason.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Good point.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:15.000
All right, it is stricken from the list.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
So there it is, guys.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000
That was a very tough process.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
It was like pulling teeth, but here we go.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
The answers you have left to vote for.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
WoW loses a million subs over the year.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Indie game goes from indie to AAA in the scope of a year.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Oculus Rift released at 4K resolution.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Microsoft jacks the Rift.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Ouya goes under.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Those are some hefty choices, you guys, but you can vote now.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Now, some of you might be thinking, oh, all of those are going to come true.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Well, you're going to click on your number 1 and your number 2.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Remember, the first one you click is your number 1,

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
and the second one you click is your number 2.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Those are the ones you like the best of those answers that are up on the board.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000
So have at it.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.000
It is now live, and you can vote for the next few minutes.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
They're at live.vognetwork.com.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
It is a live poll, and you may now vote.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.000
And we will tally up those answers and read the answers here in just a little bit.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:21.000
All right. Good times. Good times.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
A little morbid, but that's all right.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000
I think we cleaned up the list pretty good there at the end, so it's a little less morbid.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.000
We've got a few more stories for you guys, though, before we get to the answers

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
and the FUs of the week and all that good stuff.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Thank you, Alan, by the way, for participating.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
We'll let you know if one of yours wins.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Okay.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Just in case you wanted to check it out, there's another Telltale series that's free to try.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.000
At least they have the first episode for free right now, The Wolf Among Us.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:54.000
And you can get that free on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000
And I'm not sure how long it's supposed to be free for, so better act fast.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.000
And they're also doing discounts for some other stuff for the end of the year.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:06.000
They've been marking down stuff, I think, all the way up through New Year's, so go check it out.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I've heard a lot of really good things about this game.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.000
This is another one of those, I should have played it in 2013, but oops, I didn't.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.000
So, yes, I'm very curious to check this out.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Wait, wait, before you run away, Alan, don't you read?

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
You read a lot of these graphic novels and stuff.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Are you familiar with the fables that the Telltale ones based off of?

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.000
I have the first three volumes in The Office, so yeah.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Are you going to check this out? Are you curious about this game?

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
It depends on what spoilers it has for the comics,

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:39.000
because I'm only on volume 3 of the trade paperback, and they're on, what, volume 30.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.000
So I checked it out four years ago and haven't touched it since.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Uh-oh. All right.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.000
They can still mark it for download, you know, just in case.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.000
All right, well, you know, as most Telltale games, if you wait a little longer,

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.000
it'll probably be like five bucks for the whole thing at some point.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:58.000
But at the same time, I've been hearing great things about it,

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
so I don't know how much longer we can wait.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
So we'll check that out soon.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
All right, Jason, what do you got for us?

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:12.000
A couple months ago, the Mighty No. 9 gang held a vote to determine the design of Beck's Helper Call.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Those votes have been counted, and design number F.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Take a bow. Take a virtual radio bow for everybody but the YouTube listeners,

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
because I can drive that point home.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Um, design F only won by less than 3%.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Design H came in third, and design E was the close rejection.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:38.000
I really want to see what, uh, should be able to go see the vote and see what design E is,

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
because I really, really dig design F.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Very, very, you know, golden blonde hair, predominantly red, kind of lollipop striping.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Very appropriate, but really, really a good design.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Let's see, design F, that's E, this'll probably take me a minute.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:04.000
So we finally have the primary two protagonists in Mighty No. 9, Beck and Call,

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:08.000
and what each of them look like, their relevant primary color scheme, and so forth.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Uh, she kind of looks like one of those cinnamon candy canes to me with the pink and red striping.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I mean, I know this is a radio show, so I can't really, like, show you the pictures,

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.000
but just imagine, like, you know, the whole, like, Mega Man style,

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:22.000
which obviously they're changing just ever so slightly for this Mighty No. 9,

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:25.000
but she's more of, like, one of those cinnamon candy canes with big blonde hair.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:28.000
I think E was pretty good, too, taking a look at that.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:32.000
They have the, um, designs, if you go to the second page of the Kickstarter,

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:36.000
there's a link on the article there. It shows the different designs.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.000
But I like the, I like, it looks like she's gonna get something with her ears,

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
like, she got, like, helicopter ears or something, so that's, that'll be cute.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Those are, uh, oh, jeez, what are those called?

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Um, they're, they're basically, like, hair...

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I wanna say a hair tie, but that's completely incorrect.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Pigtails, you mean?

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:57.000
It's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a hair tie in a bow, basically, is what's going on there.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Uh, and suddenly my chat is not working anymore, so I can't paste this in, uh, in chat.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
No, they got it, and Pochi, Pochi Kawa put it in there, too, so.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000
It completely stopped updating for me, so I can't even see it.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Um, because tonight is my night of puns,

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.000
should I read the, uh, the pun-tastic quote at the bottom of this article?

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Sure.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Some of you may have just met Design F, and think it's crazy,

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:24.000
but she's got the numbers, so she's calm now, baby.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
That is definitely gonna do it for the news for 2013.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Um, that is the last news article we are reading, uh, this year.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:38.000
No Mighty No. 9 in our 2014 predictions, but I am very much looking forward to it.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Oh, that's cause it'll happen, it'll be amazing.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
That would've been a very safe prediction.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Well, it's, they said it's gonna come out in 2014 when the Kickstarter whole thing happened.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Uh, I think, was it supposed to be 2015?

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Ah, it was 2014. Uh-oh.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Maybe Mighty No. 9 getting delayed would've been a good guess, alright.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Number, uh, Style E is like, it's like a cross between Officer Jenny and, um...

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Yeah, a little bit.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Oh, what other character am I thinking of? I can't even, I can't even think of a name or a universe to put it to.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:13.000
They're all cute. Uh, look at, look at the Kickstarter page, look at the vote, these are, these are fantastic designs.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
I'm really looking forward to this game.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Yeah, um, according to the Kickstarter page, the digital copy, the estimated delivery is April 2015.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Oh, wow.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Alright, well, uh, it is about that time, we're almost to the part of the show where we're gonna take calls,

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.000
but first, we wanna hear from our listeners in a segment we call The Mailbag.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Every week, you guys email us mailbag at orangelaundry.com,

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:41.000
and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and finds a few emails that she thinks,

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.000
oh, this, this is worth looking at. Let's talk about this tonight.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.000
I like Dee best.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Oh, you're looking at the...

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Yeah, I think I really like Dee best.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Why is that?

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Dee is like gothic, goth Lolita kinda, something like that.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Exactly, exactly. She's kinda dark and badass.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.000
And I like B2 because it sorta gives me that Dr. Slump vibe.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Mailbag.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Alright, I know you're reading a lot of letters, but there's some letters in our mailbag as well.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.000
And you're complaining about me tonight! Wow!

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Wow!

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Jamie?

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Just a thought such as it is, I presume the YouTube content ID issue won't come to a head

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:28.000
when a major partner channel such as Tabuscus and Epic Mealtime and Vsauce gets taken down for content claims.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Rather, it will happen when Disney, say, issues a claim or has a claim issued on their behalf

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:37.000
against content from one of Viacom's own channels or vice versa.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Also, I'm disappointed that the Mac version of the Stanley Parable requires 10.8.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:47.000
I'm hesitant to upgrade my OS on my 2009 laptop to even 10.7.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Much less seriously and too wordy, from what I understand, of the plot of Assassin's Creed 4.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:35:02.000
I'd like to see them have taken as much historic liberties with their Chanties as with the music of Bioshock Infinity.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Ideally take inspiration from Dinosaur Comics and sing pop songs with babies substituted with Matey.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Everyone's trying to be me Matey, Matey I love your way, Matey done a bad bad thing and so on.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
That comes from Robert M.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.000
And that's the YouTube thing.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
I'm full of it tonight.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Epic Mealtime is never going to have a content ID against them because all of their stuff is 100% original.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Here's something else to consider. As much as that's how we all want to see it go down,

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000
you all know YouTube has a secret whitelist that nobody talks about.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
The people that are on the whitelist aren't talking about it.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:38.000
But that's why Viacom's not going to have a copyright claim against them ever. They're on the whitelist.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:43.000
That's what some of the outrage was is because some of these people that we would have presumed were on it,

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:47.000
affiliates, notably, were starting to get screwed by this.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:53.000
I think Epic Mealtime, Epic Mealtime primary channel will not, but their spinoff Original Gamer,

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:57.000
assuming that's even still a thing, I actually haven't watched it in quite a couple of weeks now.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Original Gamer stands the biggest threat because of their non-original content, non-original video.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:11.000
But it remains to be seen what changes do and don't happen as a result of the last couple of weeks of fallout.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Next email?

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Yes.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Was there a name on that last email?

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:19.000
That was Robert M.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Oh, I missed that somehow.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:28.000
I wanted to share a quick story. I just finished rebuilding my DDR pad for this winter and have been jamming about four times a week.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:33.000
My legs have never hurt so bad and I'm a hardcore road cyclist. It's a different kind of impact.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Anyway, last night I finished on a heavy nine-step that is lightning steps for half the song.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000
My legs were jello, so I walked downstairs and completely pulled my left quad.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Now I can barely walk. When people ask what happened, I get a hazy look in my eye and tell them that I pulled a muscle dance into a video game.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:56.000
You know their typical response? They smile politely and walk away. They don't know what to say. How awkward.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
I don't know what to tell you.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:05.000
I'm going to give you a little bit of advice a trainer gave me, but by no means am I a trainer slash doctor, whatever.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:13.000
When you are done playing DDR, don't walk downstairs, don't walk upstairs, don't do anything more strenuous.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Walk slowly and stretch. Stretch while your muscles are warm and usually you'll avoid cramps.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.000
That's just my experience, but again, I'm not a professional.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.000
I think it's a generally accepted thing out there too. Make sure you always stretch before you play.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:30.000
No, no, no. Don't stretch before you play. Stretch after you warm up.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:35.000
If you stretch a muscle when it has not warmed up, you can do more damage to it.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Okay. Fair enough. I can see that because they do say you should walk a little bit before you do like stretching.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Well, here's an example. When I go to the gym, I spend five minutes on a bike or recumbent bike or the treadmill.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Then I do 10 minutes of yoga. Then I lift my weights. So just saying.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:55.000
But always stretch after you've done doing anything strenuous because then that'll prevent cramps.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Am I getting old or am I just overdoing it? As a 34-year-old, this is my main form of exercise during the non-cycling months.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.000
I'm sure you guys have had DDR injuries, right? Right? Well, actually, you remember the issue?

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
It's been a long time, but yeah.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
I did fall and hit my head on the machine once.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:19.000
But you remember those shoes that I had that I couldn't do jumping moves because the arch support in my shoes were sending pain.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:32.000
It sent pain up my feet. And so I would come off of the machine with shooting pain going up both of my legs coming directly from my arches because I already have pretty hefty arches in my feet.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:37.000
I don't have flat feet. I have the opposite problem. I have really high arches in my feet.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:49.000
And when I changed from using arch support shoes to using either flats like Converse, All Stars, or the Airwalk equivalent and my Vibrams, that all went away.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:54.000
So that was my biggest injury with DDR.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:39:03.000
But I can tell you that I had pulled, actually torn a tendon in my foot in high school, not high school, in college in Alabama.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:11.000
And I had been in just a loose brace for the next few years after that, but playing DDR healed it because I made my foot stronger.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.000
To continue with email? You guys didn't have any other contribution?

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:16.000
No.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
I did hit my head on the DDR machine once.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Because I don't want to make the guy hurt himself worse.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:26.000
I haven't played serious DDR in a very long time, sadly. It is what it is.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:36.000
There's a few people in chatroom, by the way. I def said I twisted my ankle playing DDR twice. Once on a cobalt flux pad. It was rather painful.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
So to continue this email, it's almost done.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Loki, I got Surgeon Simulator on Steam sale today. Good grief, it's impossible, but hilarious.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Your loyal turtle in Philly. Serious turtle.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:52.000
It's a fun game. And yes, it is impossible.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
The space one is hilarious.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Okay, so last email.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Hey OLR crew, AZHP here. You get the last email of the year.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Bum bum, you win.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Air. Take a deep breath.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Just wanted to chime in with a few thoughts I had on PAX's diversity lounge idea.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:20.000
I feel like that by labeling a room as a place to learn about diversity in gaming culture, it's making it seem like it will be the only room where PAX minorities can feel safe and at ease.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:26.000
It's a hard sell to make a room shoved into a corner feel like you're being, quote, inclusive to people.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:35.000
I also wanted to bring your guys' attention to the awesome games done quick charity marathon, which you guys mentioned last year on your show.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:41.000
You guys talked about it after the marathon was over, so I wanted to make sure all the listeners knew about the marathon before it starts.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:51.000
It runs from Sunday, January 5th through the 11th and will feature some of the best speed gamers from around the world, playing games fast to raise money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:41:00.000
I got really into speed running after watching last year's marathon and started learning tricks for some classic games like Super Mario 64, that would be the wall jump, and Ocarina of Time.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Learning each new trick helps drive your time down and it's kind of addicting.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Side note, my best times on the games are 22 minutes for Super Mario 64 and 25 minutes for Ocarina of Time.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:28.000
There are bidding wars and prize raffles throughout the marathon as well, so if you want to donate money to a good cause, have the chance to win prizes, and watch people completely wreck games that you love in ways you never thought possible, make sure to watch and just search awesome games done quick and it will be the first link.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Thanks for reading my email, hope you all had a happy holiday and have a happy new year, AZHP.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Thank you for reminding me of the charity event, I know Flaco Jones is a big fan of this too, it's an ex-feral and a horde house, watches a lot of this too.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:50.000
So yeah, these guys are very popular and it's for good reason, and yeah, that speedrun stuff can be addicting. I'm terrible at it, but it's sort of fun to think about it.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Those people are just like, the level of detail that they understand a game's engine is phenomenal to me.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Well, I used to be able to do that when I was a kid.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:14.000
So I was watching, there's a buddy of mine that grew up in New Mexico that recently moved out to Maine, and I've been watching a lot of the stuff he's been playing.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:29.000
He knows Spyro, I don't remember if it's two or three, but he knows Spyro glitches, like the back of his hand, and he's getting really really good at getting the reproducible.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:45.000
He's speedrunning Shattered Memories, even though I don't think there's really, I don't think there's any glitches in it, he just finds the best path and skips through the sequences and cutscenes, the doctor sequences as much as possible, as quick as possible, all that kind of stuff.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:43:05.000
And that speedrun is literally just learning the best path to the game, but I revisited some of those awesome games on quick videos from the summer, and somebody was speedrunning Super Meat Boy just Light World Clear, I don't think he did Dark Worlds, but they also got Team Meat in on Skype.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:15.000
And the programmers of the game didn't, they were shocked that they had never heard of some of these bugs before.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Whether they went and fixed them after the factor, figured out why they're happening, I have no idea, but just the level of dedication that, whether they stumble across it randomly or with skill, completely phenomenal, and everything about that production is so fantastic.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Great charity, great video, great skill. I didn't know they do it twice a year, so I'm definitely looking forward to being able to watch that in a week or two.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Did you know Dan and I actually tried for like an hour each trying to learn the wall jump in Super Mario 64 so that we could get up to the roof and beat the game?

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
I had heard of that, I don't think I ever tried.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:55.000
There's videos up, and apparently it's supposed to work in the DS version as well.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:01.000
I don't have the precision to play that on Mario 64 DS.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Alright, that is it for the mailbag.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Indeed, that is it.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:13.000
This is also your very last chance to vote in tonight's List List. You're already slackin' if you waited this long, this is your last chance.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Live.vognetwork.com, and we will read the answers here shortly, but first we have the FUs of the week. Here we go.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:49.000
I feed a pink berry for having peppermint and chocolate because it was so good and I want more, but I've had wine tonight, so no pink berry.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Wine's really good though, do you need any wine flavored pink berry?

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:59.000
No, you know what though they had in Japan last year, Rob? They had muscat grape KitKats.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:07.000
And they were amazing. My friend who lives in Nagoya sent, you remember my friend Julie, right?

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:15.000
And our friend Krista? Krista lives in Nagoya? She sent Julie a bunch of muscat KitKats and we went through the whole box.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:22.000
They're amazing. Okay, pink berry, get muscat flavor. Do it.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Alright, Loki, you have some FUs of the week?

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:34.000
I feed my cat who thinks I'm a pillow or something. She's literally an inch away from the microphone.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Alright, Jason, do you have any FUs?

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:46.000
I have nothing against alcohol, but FU do excuses to get smashed at 11 in the morning.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Oh yeah, that's a bit much.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:50.000
That's what they do to people.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:57.000
I was like, you're not gonna dog our wine drinking, are you? Gotta be responsible. We always advocate responsibility as well.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:04.000
My FU of the week goes to, FU did the scare that Alan might be getting sick again and therefore I might be getting sick again.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
I was just sick. I don't want to be sick again.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Hey, you should be more concerned for Alan being healthy so Alan can be healthy.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:12.000
No, I want to be healthy.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:14.000
So rude.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:16.000
But yes, it would be nice.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Alan, do you hear this fuckery?

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Yes, it would be nice if Alan was healthy too.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Alright, there it is. That is it for the FUs of the week. What are you laughing about over there?

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Nothing.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:29.000
You trying to start some shit? That's what you're trying to do over there.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
No, I'm not. But you know what? I do want pink berry right now.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Of course you do.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000
And I don't want to get sick either.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Alright, that is it. We are done-zo with the question tonight from the listless question there.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:49.000
I'm just waiting for the answers to load in there and we can tell you what the top answers were.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Here it is, the definitive list. Our predictions for 2014. Here we go.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Your number three answer. Where's Alan? Alan? There he is. Number three answer.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Number three answer. Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.000
So there you go. Number three is the winner.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Yay.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:10.000
And I didn't mean what I said earlier.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Alright, don't cough up my mic.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Alright, the number two answer. Here it is. Number two answer.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:31.000
And the number one answer, the thing that absolutely has to happen in 2014 as voted on by the listeners.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:36.000
And thank God a shiny happy answer won after the dark places we went to tonight.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled. There it is.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:43.000
Very good.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
We're all nice people after all.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Sometimes. Eventually.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:56.000
There it is. The definitive list. Again, that is Fallout 4 confirmed. F-Zero Boner Party and innovation leading to advances for the disabled.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
There it is. Thank you guys for participating in List List tonight.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:06.000
We hope to do that again. We have gone too long since the last time we played that game, so we will have to do that again very soon.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:10.000
So there it is. That is it for the mailbag, the stories.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:20.000
We are now ready for your calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:22.000
It is that time to give us a call.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:31.000
Now I'm going to apologize in advance. We're doing something a little different with the Skype line tonight, and so I'm getting to test this live on air as we're going.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:33.000
So please bear with us.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:39.000
But with this setup, we do not have to say goodbye to Loki. He can stay on the line and chat with our Skype calls.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:47.000
If you want to talk to Loki or anybody here in the studio or give your own thoughts on what happened in 2013 or what you'd like to see in 2014, give us a call right now.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:53.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. One word.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Meanwhile, some last minute stories, possibly, maybe. Loki, do you have anything for last minute stories tonight?

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:01.000
No, sadly I don't.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Yeah, there's really not a whole heck of a lot going on, is there?

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:10.000
So let me see if we have any Twitter topics. I'm going to try to pull those up real quick here again while we wait for some calls.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:15.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:17.000
You know, I hope it works.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Do you know they have a new toll-free prefix coming up?

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Do they really?

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.000
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000
They're just kind of going down the list of all the 800s, eight double digits.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:33.000
I shouldn't be surprised that they're running out of stuff or whatever.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Considering how dirt cheap it is for anybody to pick one up now, and it's only getting easier.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:44.000
It's weird that for that reason, it's not weird for that reason that non-phone number based systems aren't coming up. What the hell am I saying?

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Alright, we are getting a call, so let's get to it. We are going to go to the phones right now and take a call.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Hey, this is Act F.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Hey Act F, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:01.000
Well, first of all, did it work?

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Yes, it worked. We can hear you just fine.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Okay. Well, I was thinking about Jason's, one of Jason's answers. I think it was number one on the list list.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:17.000
The indie game going triple A development.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:25.000
And I was thinking about the My Little Pony fighting game that sees and desists.

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
Why are you laughing, Jason? You're laughing like crazy over there.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Because this doesn't surprise me, I guess.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Of course you're thinking about the My Little Pony game, right?

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Well, I was thinking about that, and now they're working on their own game. Their own original game.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:57.000
And I was thinking about and hoping that possibly it could get picked up like a big publisher or something.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:05.000
And get a big release. Something like, well, maybe possibly like Skullgirls.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:10.000
It was a small release, but then it got big.

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:18.000
I was going to say, to be fair though, Skullgirls wasn't really a triple A title.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
I mean, I know it has a lot of fans, but it's not exactly triple A.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:25.000
I'm not knocking it. I'm just saying. Right?

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Well, maybe not that big, or maybe not triple A, but big. Mostly.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:42.000
What else? Any gaming resolutions you have for 2014? Or no, we read one of your answers during the Google answers, right?

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Yeah, one of my Google... Well, one of... Sorry.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Something beeping over there?

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Was that the Power Rangers theme? What was that? Yeah.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Yeah, it was my phone. Sorry.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Well, yeah, you already read my resolutions, and sorry again. Damn it.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Stop texting actdeft. He's on the radio, people.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Well, there we go. Yeah, all my game resolutions are mostly a new PC for gaming, because my current one is good, but not that great.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:22.000
Mostly the processor is old, so I need to at least replace that.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:27.000
And yes, Matt, it was a Power Rangers ringtone.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Yes, it was. Alright. Oh, go ahead.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Yeah, my other resolution, the HDTV, is my top priority right now, because I have the gaming consoles, and even the PC, which I have, the video card has HDMI out, so I can use that for gaming, too.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:55.000
It will probably happen soon, since I'm pretty much saving the money for that.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:12.000
So yeah, that's mostly what I want to do next year, and of course, my hundreds and hundreds of games on Steam, and not to mention an Xbox. I have the Xbox games that I haven't finished, so I need to get on that.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:17.000
There's too much to play, but it's not exactly a bad problem to have, right?

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
Yeah, too much to play in so little time.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Alright. Well, Act F, buddy, we're going to let you go to try and get some more calls, but thanks so much for the call, and have a great new year.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.000
Thank you, you too.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:29.000
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line once again for some more calls, over at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word. Skype line's open right now.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:49.000
I was going to try to get to some Twitter topics while we wait for another call here, if I can.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:55.000
I want to read a tweet. We had something from YYR, and I want to make sure I got this one, because this is really funny what happened here.

02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Okay, YYR sent us a tweet here on Twitter, and it says, the number one downloadable 3DS game in Japan this year, Bike Rider DX.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:10.000
Why? It's awesome. It's $2.99 in the North American eShop. Buy it, OLR.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Alright, and get this. It was retweeted by who? The makers of the game. Look at that. Retweeted by the makers of the game.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:24.000
So, very cool there. So yeah, I guess I'll have to check that out. I don't know much about that game.

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:28.000
Is it like a site bike? Because that's kind of what it looks like to me, just based on what little I see here.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:32.000
I'm trying to see if there's some of the pictures here. Looks like a lot of this stuff is just retweeted.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:38.000
Oh no, it doesn't actually look like a site bike at all. It's more like a little 2D platformer type of thing.

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.000
That's kind of cute. For $2.99, I'd try it.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:49.000
So it's probably a style of game not terribly unlike Trials, where more lean mechanics and physics and all that kind of stuff.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Yeah, it might be a little more something like that.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:58.000
This is a very attractive looking game. I've never heard of this before. 3DS eShop. I know what purchase I'm making in the future.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:03.000
I was like, I think I might actually have enough left in my wallet now that it's shared between Wii U and 3DS.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:06.000
Because I put like $10 in the other day when I bought Castlevania and stuff.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Which, I know I don't have to do that, but whatever.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:17.000
Again, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, orange on radio, last chance to call the show ever in 2013.

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:23.000
So give us a call and we'll talk. Do I have other tweets? Let me look.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.000
Let's go to other tweets. Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet for a future week.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Although I'm going to be real honest, I tend to only see the stuff the day of the show.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
S2100matt sent us a tweet.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Nine year an MVP baseball lot lives on through the Latin American mod community with the MVP Carby.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
I have no idea what this is even talking about.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:54.000
I think it's Caribe. Because it was a... I don't know all of the backstory about this because I haven't followed a lot of baseball video gaming stuff.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:01.000
But it's basically along the lines of a classic MVP baseball game totally modded for newer rosters.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
I remember this game that's right and it's been long gone.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:10.000
So it's been gone for ten years, this MVP baseball, because a licensing deal fell through for them ten years ago.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:19.000
But things live on thanks to this remake essentially that's on the PC which is a celebration of Latin American baseball.

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:21.000
That's pretty cool.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Okay, now I get it. I have heard of this game before and you can check that out.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:31.000
So if you like your baseball, Latin American baseball, you can check that out.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Let's see, trying to find some other tweets here over at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:44.000
Gemet Hunts tweeted us earlier this week and put, or actually it was just yesterday, saying,

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Oh God, Sky, O-L-R, I got started on Tiny Death Star this week and also, yes, I know I'm a bit behind on shows.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:55.000
That's fine. Not everybody can listen the week of the show.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:00.000
But I was just going to say, I finally quit Tiny Death Star just before they put in the holiday stuff.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
So I'm glad I got you hooked on a game that I quit.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
Play the Doctor Who game instead. Damn it, Brad.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Brad was telling me about that game. Is it? How much is it on iOS?

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:12.000
Free.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:14.000
I like that.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
It has the stupid transaction thing again.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:22.000
But, um, you don't need any of them. I haven't ever used any and they give you freebies all the time.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:24.000
All right.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:32.000
I think I've just, uh, I've been replaying levels actually to unlock characters until I got, uh, the Sontaran Butler.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:37.000
And I can always forget that guy's name, but like I have River Song now. I'm very happy.

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:42.000
All right. Uh, I'm going to give one more shout out for the Skypline and see if we get anybody.

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:48.000
That's weird. No, everybody's, everybody's shy here on the last night of the year. 1-8-7-7 Game O-L-R or username.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:54.000
I was worried that the setup didn't work because I have things run differently tonight, but, uh, Act Def got through. So I know it works.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
No, I think that they're being reflective on the year.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:01.000
They're just being quiet and pensive on the year? Perhaps?

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.000
I think so.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:08.000
So there's a, there's a lot of Doctor Who games that all have subtitles. Do you know what the subtitle for this particular one is?

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Crap. Let me look it up because I have my hand.

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:17.000
I'll do a couple other quick tweets if I can real quick. Um, there was a tweet. This was, I remember this email from last week.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:26.000
I don't know if you guys remember this email last week from CK Ender who was kind of giving us another perspective and I believe it was the email on the NSA and it was kind of making us think differently about that.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:31.000
Well, CK Ender sent us a tweet and said, thanks for reading my email and giving it a fair shake. Great show this week.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:39.000
Hey, you know what? Well thought out opinions. We're always, I'm always for presenting both sides of the story. So I'm all for that.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Uh, let's see. We also have another tweet from earlier this week from Dave Falcon who said to the OLR gang, Sky, Loki and Dark Sakura, hope you and your families have a great Xmas and best wishes for Happy New Year.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Well, thank you very much. Same to you.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:54.000
That was kind.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:58.000
That was very nice. All right. And Tiger Claw sent us one more tweet again. This is the last call for calls.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:04.000
I can't believe nobody's going to call in last show of the year except Act Deft. Are you guys going to let Act Deft have the final word this year?

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:06.000
All right, 181.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:08.000
I think Act Deft has earned the final word.

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:13.000
877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:18.000
Uh, Tiger Claw 305 sending us a tweet here and this is probably the last one for the year.

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Porn discovered on 3DS purchased as Christmas present for 8 year old.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:25.000
I saw that.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:29.000
I can't believe this didn't make it in the show role. I even came across this this week and meant to put it in.

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:31.000
Here's why I don't necessarily like.

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:33.000
That was probably a bad choice of word.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Well, this is why I don't necessarily like talking about this article.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
This really at its core has nothing to do with gaming.

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:44.000
It's just shithead moves giving all of us a bad name.

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:49.000
And I'm not saying you can't put porn on your 3DS. I don't care. Put all the porn you want on your 3DS.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Get rid of it if you're going to sell it to a third party because A, you want to get rid of your personal data.

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:57.000
B, what if that's you in that porn?

02:59:58.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Most companies have a protocol for removal.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:01.000
Which this company should have done.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
In words and not in execution.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Yeah, but during the Christmas season.

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:10.000
But is it, oh, it is a link to a local news story.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:12.000
Of course it's local news.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
I gotta bring it up here. I gotta see how the local news.

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
If you guys aren't going to call us on Skype, then we're going to entertain ourselves here.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:20.000
You know what's worse?

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:22.000
My local news.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:24.000
I actually recognize the station.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
It's Colorado's local. Denver's local NBC.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Well, let's see here. I'm going to try to bring this up here in studio real quick.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
Again, I did not screen this, so we're going to take a look at this.

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:36.000
We're doing it live.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Yeah, fuck it. We'll do it live.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:40.000
All right, let's see. Where is it? Where's the story?

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
Oh, here it is. Wavy?

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:48.000
Davey Wavy News 10 reports on this story. Here it is.

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:52.000
W-A-V-Y 10 on your side.

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
Wait, what? That's not...

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:59.000
That's what it says. I was going to say W-A-V-Y is not out of Colorado. Is that out of Hampton, Virginia?

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:03.000
I don't know what Twitter tweet you saw.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
Oh, I went back to the previous years.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:08.000
Okay, never mind. Proceed.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:10.000
You all right over there, Jason? You're malfunctioning.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:12.000
No, I just followed the wrong link.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:17.000
All right, let's go to this sensationalist local news report and take a look.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:19.000
I'm hoping there's not an ad here in the front.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:21.000
Of course there's a...

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:31.000
They want... It's a hilarious local ad for a car place that's selling tires with Santa shaking his butt there.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:36.000
Oh God, I know which part of Virginia this is. I've been here. All right, here we go.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:42.000
A family in Hampton finds sexual images on their son's new gaming console.

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:46.000
They bought it for Christmas. Their son was the first to discover the disturbing images.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
10 on your side's Jason Marks is investigating...

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:56.000
And they bought it for Christmas. I just... The way she singsong that really disturbed me.

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Jason?

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.000
Anita, that's the question everyone is asking. How could porn get on a newly bought Nintendo DS?

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
How do people put things on memory codes?

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:12.000
How does porn get on something connected to the internet? How does that happen? That blows my mind.

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:16.000
Jamie, how does porn get on an internet-enabled device?

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
Because someone owned it before.

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Oh. Well, why did Channel 10 have to invent... All right.

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Because they're stupid.

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:27.000
Well, to be fair, we haven't seen this the whole way through.

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:29.000
No, they're stupid. I looked at it. They're stupid.

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:31.000
They're great for us playing this clip on the show.

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:33.000
A gift that was meant for an 8-year-old.

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:37.000
Normally he would be asking to play on his DS and hasn't yet.

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:43.000
Sure. Any kid who just got a Nintendo DS Christmas morning would be chomping at the bit to play the system.

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:48.000
But Tom Mayhew's 8-year-old son got an eyeful just after opening his gift.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.000
Later on during the day, he went to play his games, not knowing anything was on it.

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:58.000
And then after a while, they took a picture of themselves, a couple of the kids that were here.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:02.000
And when the picture was taken, it went to a file.

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
When that file was opened, there was already pictures on it.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Not just any pictures, images the Hampton 8-year-old should never see.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:15.000
It was a shocker because we had quite a bit of the family over, so there was a lot of kids here.

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:19.000
And the kids were the ones that discovered those pictures.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:23.000
To be fair, I'm going to try to be Devil's advocate a little bit here, although it's difficult.

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:28.000
But I mean, I can see where it's not like the pictures are front and center.

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:32.000
They are buried a little bit in the 3DS. You do have to go into...

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
The story as he's telling it makes perfect sense.

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:40.000
When you open the 3DS, you don't think, oh, I better go in and check all the pictures.

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:46.000
So it makes sense that, oh, the kids took the picture, they went to go look at the pictures of themselves in OMG boobs.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
The story makes sense.

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:53.000
And the thing too is they bought it new. It wasn't like they were buying the U-System.

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:55.000
So they claim.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:57.000
The text of the article...

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:01.000
Well, they bought it from Walmart though, so Walmart doesn't sell U-System.

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:03.000
Walmart does open box.

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
Walmart will sell a return.

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:07.000
Yeah, absolutely.

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
Is Walmart a target? I can't remember which one. One of those.

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:18.000
Well, let's see. Because you know if it's 10 on your side, they're going to go to the store where the manager will refuse to give comment.

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:20.000
Because that's what always happens in these stories. So let's see what happens.

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:27.000
Or there will be a corporate statement and they'll have the text come up on the screen with the little image of the letter in the background because that's how the local news works.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
So let's see if my prediction holds out here.

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:36.000
Mayu says the DS had a dozen pornographic pictures. Now he wants to know where they came from.

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:38.000
Well...

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:40.000
Why don't you ask the lady?

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
Well, they could have been internet porno, who knows.

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:51.000
...for them to really even be on there. It's disgusting for one. It seems weird that this was the only thing left on it.

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Mayu first thought it was a Nintendo mistake, but now he has another theory.

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:58.000
It's a big mistake.

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:02.000
It's important to note that people will think that. They will think...

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:04.000
They're dumb.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
Well, it's not that they're dumb. They just don't know better. There's a big difference.

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:09.000
They're ignorant.

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:15.000
What was interesting about this before... I immediately discarded this when it said pornographic.

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:28.000
But it is known that as a part of QC testing, assembly line workers will take pictures of a unit of themselves or something along the line to make sure that the camera in the batch of systems works.

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:40.000
There's a compendium of pictures from iPhones and iPads, iPods, all that kind of stuff, of Chinese factory workers because they're QC-ing the camera during assembly.

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:42.000
But not 12 pictures of boobs.

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
Yeah, this is a very different situation.

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:52.000
Plus, if you could see the video, they look like internet MySpace blingy images that have boobs. I mean, that's what these things look like.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:56.000
I can't totally tell through the boobs, but this doesn't look like basement...

03:05:56.000 --> 03:06:05.000
What's even more interesting about that is that means they were downloaded from a site because the DS doesn't have the ability to make those kinds of effects when you take a picture.

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:15.000
These were not pictures. Yeah, you can save things, save images from the browser to the SD card or what have you, but it's interesting. It wasn't pictures...

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:20.000
It wasn't made by the DS alone. It was actually connected to the internet.

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
Sorry, I let it keep playing. Alright, let me let this finish here.

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:28.000
And those things were not deleted from it, so it wasn't a new product. It was a used product.

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:36.000
Mayu tells us the pictures were time-stamped in early December. He bought the system here at the Hampton Walmart at 23rd.

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:45.000
Here we go. 10 on your side called the corporate office, and we're still waiting to get a call back. As we wait for answers, a father has come up with a question.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:53.000
Oh, so they didn't even get a comment yet. They just called the corporate office and no letter yet. Well, what's Walmart going to say to that?

03:06:54.000 --> 03:07:01.000
Oh man, clearly an employee was putting boobies on our 3DS. Here's a gift card. Let me let this finish.

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:07.000
Mainly is what is my youngest son thinking about those pictures being on there?

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:14.000
Dad plans to soon have the talk with his son, a conversation he thought would only come several years from now.

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:18.000
He's an eye-opener. Why would those even be on there?

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:27.000
Mayu says he found another clue that could show that there was a return system. The Nintendo DS comes with parental controls that require a password.

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:36.000
On his DS, the parental controls were already set up, password included. As I mentioned, we're still waiting for Walmart to call us back.

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
I don't remember going through that stuff.

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
Walmart sold a return system as new. That's what they did.

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:49.000
Yeah, alright, fine. Thank you. Thank you, Davey Wavy News for the clip there.

03:07:50.000 --> 03:08:02.000
Well, to be perfectly honest, I think that especially if that was just a re-boxed return, then yeah, he's within his rights to, first of all, request a new system and have that sent back.

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:14.000
Because clearly, it's, I'm trying to remember what it is too. You can't sell a used system without marking that it has been used or a refurb.

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:25.000
That goes against, I'm trying to remember because I was reading up on the resale law too, just not too long ago. That has to do with truth in advertising.

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
I see that at Fry's all the time.

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:37.000
But Fry's will flat out say return. They have a big sticker on it that says this is a return. When you go to any other retailer, it will say refurbished.

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:44.000
In the rush of the holidays, that didn't happen at this Walmart and now they're going to get raked through the coals for it.

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:48.000
Well, I can't think of a company that deserves it more, but still.

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:55.000
Going back to the beginning where this is all at, I hate that these things are considered gaming news because it really has nothing to do with the console.

03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:02.000
It has nothing to do, but unfortunately, you heard the guy, this is the reality when stories like this come out, you heard the guy there.

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:09.000
My first thought was it was something with Nintendo. And all of us that kind of know how these things really work, we saw the punchline coming a mile away.

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.000
Somebody returned a system that was sold as new. And for all we know-

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:16.000
It should be common sense regardless, but-

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:22.000
This whole thing was probably a prank, if you think about it. The whole thing was probably a setup.

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
There's probably some assholes watching the news, giggling.

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:27.000
Oh yeah, absolutely. The whole thing is probably a setup.

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:29.000
We showed that little kid some dick.

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:31.000
Which is kind of fucked up in a way.

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:36.000
Our plot twist, it was the news station that returned it with the porn on it.

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:38.000
For ratings.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.000
For ratings.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:42.000
Trying to make some waves.

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:44.000
I don't think either of those are the case.

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:45.000
What do you think, then?

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:47.000
I don't think it was a new system, and I don't think it was intentional.

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:59.000
But it was a guy that did something, or perhaps not even a guy, but it was somebody that did something with the system and ultimately didn't want it because they didn't want to have to continue to pay for new things, so they took it back.

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:04.000
It was just before- there's a myriad of other possibilities considering it was just before Christmas.

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:11.000
I don't- I'm with you on the fact that this isn't gaming news, and this is just tripe.

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000
If that's even the correct word to use in this situation, but-

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:16.000
This is slow news week news.

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:18.000
Alright, fair enough.

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000
Alright, well that is gonna do it. I'm gonna close up the Skype line.

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:29.000
How sad. I would have thought more of you would want to see our new studio cam on Skype, but I guess I'll have to wait until next week.

03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:31.000
Act-Def didn't say anything about it either.

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:33.000
He was talking about it in chat.

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:38.000
I would have thought the first caller would have been like, whoa, I can see you guys now, but we thought-

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:42.000
You know, if we get one more caller, I'll even be willing to let it point at me.

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:44.000
Too late?

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:50.000
It will have to be a 2014 enhancement to the show, except Act-Def got a sneak peek because he was willing to call.

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:56.000
We're gonna close up the Skype line, and we're gonna close up shop here at Orange Lawns Radio for the night and for the year.

03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:00.000
And thank you guys as always for being here. Thank you for listening to the show.

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:06.000
Thank you for supporting the show all year long, whether you're new this year or you've been listening for the past eight years.

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:12.000
We really appreciate your support. If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or five about the show. Really, really appreciate it.

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:16.000
Spread the word about Orange Lawns Radio. That's all we have, is word of mouth.

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:18.000
I did have a last minute story real quick.

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:20.000
Oh, you do? Okay.

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:22.000
Well, go for it.

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:38.000
Okay. Apparently at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress, which is a hacker con, they demonstrated that they have cracked the Nintendo Wii U game pad controller to allow streaming of PC content to it.

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000
So you can use it almost like Nvidia's shield.

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:43.000
Oh, wow.

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:57.000
And so it's obviously early and a little bit buggy, but they're releasing code up there to make that happen. Apparently they're building tools to allow that to stream stuff on Windows and OS X.

03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:05.000
CCC is an amazing collective. They do some fantastic shit. I love them so much. This is great news.

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:08.000
Didn't they also crack the Wiimote?

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:25.000
I don't remember what name went behind that. If you caught the news about the lifting fingerprints off the phone in order to fake out the iPhone 5S's fingerprint sensor, that was also a CCC project.

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:35.000
They are based out of Germany and a coworker of mine has been to a handful of their meetups before. If I ever find myself in Germany, I would love to go.

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:46.000
Alrighty. Some thoughts in our chat room. Ragenator saying, here's a thought on the porn story. What are the odds that a parent, probably the dad, was testing out the system before it was wrapped?

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:50.000
Forgot that the pics were on the system and when the pics were discovered, the parents tried covering their asses.

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:56.000
You know, crazier things have happened in the world, but in this case, I don't really think that's gonna happen.

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:58.000
You know what's interesting?

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:00.000
My finger slipped on the trigger.

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:05.000
Well, the problem too is the date stamp is different. The date stamp is earlier than he purchased it.

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:13.000
That's true. Alright, well anyway, we really are gonna wrap up the show. I don't wanna talk, for the first time in my life, I don't wanna talk about porn anymore.

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.000
Alright, that is gonna do it though for another episode.

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:18.000
It's a Christmas miracle!

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:20.000
Christmas is over.

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:24.000
Here you go, kid. Dick. You get dick for Christmas.

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:26.000
Alright, that's it. We're done. We're outta here.

03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000
Thank you guys so much for supporting the show, and again, tell a friend about the show.

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:31.000
We're gonna go around and get final thoughts.

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:34.000
Jason, thank you for being here, taking the trek from the Bay Area to be here.

03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000
I'm hoping we can at least do one show in your neck of the woods at some point.

03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:39.000
It will be wonderful if it comes to fruition.

03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:45.000
That's a goal for 2014, one of our goals, a road show. A legit road show, cause we haven't done one in a while.

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:54.000
We haven't done one live since OLR was on live 365. I know we did DDR tournaments. I think that was the last time we did a full on live show.

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:56.000
I think. Don't quote me on that.

03:13:57.000 --> 03:14:00.000
I guess the E3s don't count because they were special mini shows during the week and not Sunday shows.

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:07.000
Oh! We did the All Games frat house, as I called it.

03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:11.000
But it was the arena lounge thing they had back in all games.

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:18.000
We did do a live show there, during one of the E3s. That would probably be the last time we did a full on show, start to finish, remote.

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:20.000
That was a really cool set up.

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:22.000
It was only a couple years ago.

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:24.000
It was, what, 2006 I think?

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:26.000
Like I said, just a couple.

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:28.000
That was good memories though.

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:30.000
Okay, that's it. We're gonna go around and get final thoughts.

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:32.000
Jason, now is your turn. What's your final thought?

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:34.000
Merry fucking 2014 people.

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:36.000
Good final thought.

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:39.000
Loki via the skype line. Your final thought?

03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:46.000
Looks like Grand Theft Auto 5 is becoming the hacker fest as Grand Theft Auto 4 was.

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:50.000
It's supposed to be interesting how they slap the wrists of all these people doing that.

03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:52.000
I've been hearing that actually.

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:57.000
What a shock. I am so shocked that somebody has hacked Grand Theft Auto 5. This is so surprising.

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:01.000
We made it so easy. That's the problem.

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:08.000
My final thought tonight is, I feel really good. This has been a really good year for the show.

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:13.000
One of our best since probably, and I'm not really talking quality. This show is always good.

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:15.000
We always try to bring it every week.

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:22.000
But just in terms of the growth of the show and everything, this has been probably our best year since podcasting went live.

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:26.000
So I just really want to thank everybody again for their support and the new listeners we've got over the year.

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:31.000
And just thank you for being a part of our little family here on Sunday nights. Really appreciate it. Thank you.

03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:34.000
Dark Soccer, last but not least, the final word of 2013.

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:38.000
I'm actually going to retire reject false icons because Gorillaz is gone.

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:40.000
Did they officially?

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000
I think Gorillaz is officially over because Blur is touring again.

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:45.000
I see.

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:47.000
But I have a new one for you guys.

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:51.000
Think before you speak and think before you type.

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:54.000
Alright. Think before you speak, think before you type.

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:57.000
In other words, don't be an asshole.

03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:02.000
That's the number one rule of gaming online. Don't be a dick. Unfortunately, way too many people do it.

03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:08.000
Alright guys, we will see you in 2014. Have a safe new year, whatever it is you're doing.

03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:14.000
If you are doing any drinking, do not drive. Do not drive. Do not drive. Have your plan to get home.

03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:17.000
And don't get married if you drink.

03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:21.000
Don't have a Britney Spears wedding. Don't have sex.

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:24.000
Okay, well if you're going to have sex, be safe. Alright, have a great night everybody.

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:28.000
