01:12.164 --> 01:13.244
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you playing right now?

01:13.344 --> 01:20.668
[SPEAKER_09]: You're playing... Me Plaza, so I can get puzzle pieces since a certain somebody who also has this puzzle completed came in.

01:20.888 --> 01:21.809
[SPEAKER_04]: Those puzzles.

01:21.849 --> 01:22.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:23.310 --> 01:25.912
[SPEAKER_04]: That is kind of like my little crack addiction on the 3DS.

01:26.112 --> 01:31.656
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I'm not playing a 3DS game or whatever, I like to do the little street passing, collecting the puzzles.

01:32.016 --> 01:34.718
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's really great for that now is Starbucks.

01:34.898 --> 01:35.218
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

01:35.478 --> 01:37.620
[SPEAKER_09]: I go to at least three different Starbucks a week now.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.481
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get like six people at a time now.

01:39.541 --> 01:40.802
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I'm going to steal Alan.

01:41.022 --> 01:41.383
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

01:42.173 --> 01:49.101
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, by the way, just since it's not video, Alan brought some wine in for our celebratory last episode of the year.

01:49.222 --> 01:49.822
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alan.

01:50.363 --> 01:51.785
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see Alan in Part B a little later.

01:52.358 --> 01:53.198
[SPEAKER_09]: Jam Jar is not bad.

01:53.619 --> 01:54.739
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, okay.

01:54.979 --> 01:57.741
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not as sweet as Frivolo.

01:58.101 --> 01:58.761
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, listeners.

01:58.881 --> 02:00.362
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this is not great radio, but I have wine.

02:00.382 --> 02:01.282
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having wine tasting.

02:01.302 --> 02:01.863
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having wine.

02:02.143 --> 02:02.583
[SPEAKER_04]: I am too.

02:02.603 --> 02:04.924
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to sip you here on the wine.

02:05.004 --> 02:06.025
[SPEAKER_09]: I have wine and coffee.

02:07.485 --> 02:08.346
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that combination.

02:08.566 --> 02:12.548
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, but anyway, while we sip away here on some wine, why don't we say hello via Skype?

02:12.588 --> 02:14.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Loki, everybody.

02:14.749 --> 02:15.069
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

02:15.329 --> 02:16.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Loki, how you doing?

02:18.711 --> 02:19.531
[SPEAKER_12]: I was doing good.

02:19.858 --> 02:21.199
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:49.847 --> 02:50.147
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

02:51.428 --> 02:51.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:52.048 --> 02:52.168
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

03:19.738 --> 03:20.278
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.

03:21.158 --> 03:21.678
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't blame you.

03:22.039 --> 03:25.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, have you played any of the 30 games that you've actually bought?

03:25.759 --> 03:26.240
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I have.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.860
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was your favorite out of what you played so far?

03:29.720 --> 03:31.041
[SPEAKER_12]: The Stanley Parable was pretty good.

03:31.761 --> 03:32.461
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

03:32.781 --> 03:36.642
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, did you get the two special endings?

03:38.023 --> 03:39.783
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you go visit the other places?

03:41.484 --> 04:09.615
[SPEAKER_12]: um yeah I got that ending I've got all the endings I think don't spoil y'all I'm about I think four away from beating from all of them but you also get really random ones too so yeah um well Loki the sale is through January 3rd are you gonna try to restrain yourself now or is it still open season you're gonna buy a bunch of stuff well here's the thing I'm right now things to actually buy I really want that's the thing

04:10.367 --> 04:20.851
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, just as said in our chat room just now, because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

04:21.211 --> 04:24.412
[SPEAKER_04]: And Fifth Dream in chat says, new sale is up, Loki, get crackin'.

04:24.432 --> 04:28.014
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, it's 6 o'clock, so they just flipped over.

04:28.654 --> 04:31.015
[SPEAKER_09]: And for anyone who's interested, I'm opening Normandy.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.542
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's your Animal Crossing town, right?

04:34.464 --> 04:35.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Has Duke Nukem gone up yet?

04:36.207 --> 04:39.834
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it up for a vote, but I haven't seen it actually on sale yet.

04:39.914 --> 04:40.976
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really want it on sale.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.421
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was part of one of the flash sales, but I don't remember.

04:46.441 --> 04:47.941
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been one of the ones I missed.

04:47.981 --> 04:51.001
[SPEAKER_04]: If so, I'm going to be really irked because that's one of the games I wanted to get.

04:51.362 --> 04:55.302
[SPEAKER_04]: But Loki, thank you again for the $20 gift card you got me for the holidays.

04:56.002 --> 05:00.103
[SPEAKER_04]: I used that to buy a bunch of trading cards and level myself up to $20.

05:00.963 --> 05:06.584
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I crafted that badge for the snow season or whatever, the snow winter sale badge.

05:06.984 --> 05:09.285
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got an item in there that I sold for like $0.75.

05:09.605 --> 05:11.665
[SPEAKER_04]: So that paid for like five of the cards right there.

05:12.125 --> 05:37.707
[SPEAKER_04]: so yeah the items i got were crap so i ended up just selling all of them because it was like oh hey a football manager background yeah totally awesome hey some addicting crap though all that stuff but uh yeah i got some good i've got some good stuff on steam so i'll talk a little more about that later oh i'm looking uh it looks like the flash sale right now stanley parable funny enough you guys talk about that and bioshock infinite which i'm going to talk about a little later because i finally played it this week

05:38.286 --> 05:39.007
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to play that.

05:39.447 --> 05:46.932
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but before we get to that talk, we also have to introduce here with us in studio, say hello to the voice of the show, joining us over the season.

05:47.152 --> 05:51.615
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's been about three months now, or will be by the time you're... Sure feels like it.

05:51.675 --> 05:53.036
[SPEAKER_04]: But we love having you here.

05:53.356 --> 05:58.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we've always kind of been three people, it's fun to mix things up a little while, and you do great, and you have a great voice.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.521
[SPEAKER_04]: So we always love having here in the studio Jason, everybody.

06:01.561 --> 06:02.001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's me.

06:02.161 --> 06:02.582
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

06:03.122 --> 06:06.064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still in a bit of a rush, and I'm trying to get my heart rate back down.

06:06.244 --> 06:10.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason literally walked through the door as we were playing the opening song tonight.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.952
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, maybe a little bit before.

06:13.012 --> 06:14.534
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's your excuse, young man?

06:14.594 --> 06:16.016
[SPEAKER_04]: You were in the Bay Area.

06:16.056 --> 06:17.458
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your excuse, young man?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.760
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a curfew of 6 p.m.

06:19.820 --> 06:20.421
[SPEAKER_04]: and you got here at 6.02.

06:20.702 --> 06:25.067
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ever be a co-host on Horde House because you will get emails like that.

06:25.587 --> 06:41.453
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a Raiders game versus Broncos in my defense I went to a Raiders game with a co-worker of mine and despite leaving early traffic and everything else I just I timed it perfectly well actually all things considered

06:42.353 --> 06:46.817
[SPEAKER_02]: So you did make it here, but I'm sorry you had to suffer through watching the Raiders play.

06:47.798 --> 06:48.399
[SPEAKER_02]: That's unfortunate.

06:48.819 --> 06:54.864
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually my first ever game that I've been to in a stadium, football-wise.

06:56.206 --> 07:00.149
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the Mile High Stadium as a kid, but for a concert, a teenager.

07:01.150 --> 07:06.415
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think I've ever seen a football game, high school, college, anything in a venue before.

07:06.895 --> 07:08.636
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was nice to see.

07:08.876 --> 07:13.019
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good reminder to find out how hectic things are, especially in the Bay Area.

07:13.459 --> 07:13.920
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

07:13.940 --> 07:14.800
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really interesting.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.521
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good being able to get out there and do that again.

07:16.541 --> 07:17.902
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't get shot or shot at?

07:19.203 --> 07:20.464
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them, definitely not.

07:20.504 --> 07:26.408
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one, well, there's a lot of bangs in the arena, but I don't think it was somebody firing a gun.

07:27.741 --> 07:29.824
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

07:29.864 --> 07:32.348
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf says, Jason's excuse is identical to mine.

07:32.388 --> 07:32.688
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

07:32.708 --> 07:33.129
[SPEAKER_04]: Football.

07:33.429 --> 07:37.394
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he plays in the football drum line in Atlanta, so, uh, exciting stuff.

07:37.454 --> 07:39.377
[SPEAKER_04]: He says he did this show tonight in his uniform.

07:39.517 --> 07:40.618
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how last minute it was.

07:40.779 --> 07:42.481
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, why don't you have a webcam, Bobby?

07:42.501 --> 07:43.102
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be hilarious.

07:43.502 --> 07:47.044
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you and I have seen our share of high school football games.

07:47.144 --> 07:48.245
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, yes, me and the band.

07:48.325 --> 07:55.309
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to an Alabama-Auburn game, which anyone from Alabama, any part of the South will know how big the college football thing is.

07:55.529 --> 07:56.090
[SPEAKER_09]: I fell asleep.

07:57.290 --> 07:58.011
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so bored.

08:00.248 --> 08:07.211
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, going to the chat room as well, live.vognetwork.com Mako asking some questions about Duke Nukem saying, wait, Duke Nukem forever?

08:07.551 --> 08:08.172
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you nuts?

08:08.772 --> 08:12.653
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to clarify, Duke Nukem 3D.

08:12.894 --> 08:17.275
[SPEAKER_04]: If I said forever, then I obviously overly misspoke and what a faux pas.

08:17.515 --> 08:19.176
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke Nukem 3D is what I'm waiting for.

08:19.216 --> 08:23.518
[SPEAKER_09]: That was also my very first convention land game.

08:23.698 --> 08:24.058
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

08:24.198 --> 08:27.940
[SPEAKER_09]: Was Duke Nukem 3D when you could do the voice macros and everything.

08:27.980 --> 08:28.540
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.

08:28.680 --> 08:32.822
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I've told this story on the show before, but we used to play that in the college dorms, like, over the dial-up.

08:32.982 --> 08:35.823
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, all those little rooms, I mean, dorm rooms are tiny, right?

08:35.844 --> 08:37.144
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'd all have our own phone number.

08:37.504 --> 08:45.248
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would play in my room, and then my best friend who lived next door to me would play Duke Nukem in his room, and we would call each other over the phone and do that.

08:45.628 --> 08:52.792
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bros in the dorm loved it, because they would, like, see where I'm at, and then, like, go run and tell him where I'm at, and then they'd run it over.

08:52.872 --> 08:54.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about screen lookers.

08:54.112 --> 08:55.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, that's just straight-up shit.

08:55.473 --> 08:57.334
[SPEAKER_04]: What a bunch of gossipy bitches.

08:57.374 --> 09:00.635
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think brosy straight guys can be gossipy bitches?

09:02.476 --> 09:06.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Get Call of Duty in the mix and we all understand that.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.479
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense, but offense.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.321
[SPEAKER_02]: I played... Man, what were my early dial-up days?

09:13.421 --> 09:14.702
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a lot of Warcraft 2.

09:15.863 --> 09:19.724
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I played Shadow Warrior once or twice with a friend of mine.

09:20.065 --> 09:21.905
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we had to have played Duke Nukem.

09:22.206 --> 09:22.406
[SPEAKER_02]: They're...

09:23.666 --> 09:25.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Some game of its ilk at the time.

09:25.528 --> 09:28.069
[SPEAKER_02]: There was definitely another first-person shooter I played a couple times.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.310
[SPEAKER_02]: For the life of me, I can't remember what it was.

09:30.891 --> 09:31.651
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Duke Nukem.

09:31.771 --> 09:36.294
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in the chat room reminding us, I got Duke Nukem 3D when Good Old Games gave it away.

09:37.335 --> 09:39.116
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless Good Old Games for giving that away.

09:39.296 --> 09:42.058
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got that too, so I'm very thankful about that.

09:42.098 --> 09:50.363
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I also want it on Steam, but I want to get it on sale when it's only like three bucks, is because they have that multiplayer coming, which, you know, the Good Old Games one is great, but

09:50.623 --> 09:54.947
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're trying to add to it for the Steam one, so that's what I'm trying to get in on.

09:54.987 --> 09:56.388
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, clue me in on this.

09:57.569 --> 10:02.414
[SPEAKER_02]: Has Duke Nukem multiplayer on PC not been a thing at all yet?

10:04.015 --> 10:07.258
[SPEAKER_02]: In, of course, the modern remakes, DOSBox emulation, that kind of stuff.

10:07.278 --> 10:08.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you should still be able to land it.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, Loki, do you know?

10:14.084 --> 10:14.985
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not easy.

10:15.373 --> 10:16.094
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not easy.

10:16.554 --> 10:17.495
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not what he used to be.

10:17.535 --> 10:17.935
[SPEAKER_12]: I think.

10:17.955 --> 10:18.575
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know.

10:18.595 --> 10:19.516
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't messed with it.

10:19.736 --> 10:22.078
[SPEAKER_09]: This dream says Duke Nukem Gossipy Bitches Edition.

10:22.898 --> 10:29.283
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was going to say that I played a Duke match not long ago, but now that I think about it, that was probably on Xbox 360 after I picked that up.

10:29.663 --> 10:30.064
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

10:30.084 --> 10:30.664
[SPEAKER_02]: That was on.

10:31.024 --> 10:44.074
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I guess games of those time were built for like IPX and NetBIOS and all of this other ridiculous out-of-date nonsense that predates, you know, LAN parties in the stable way that they are now.

10:45.151 --> 10:46.892
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:03.143 --> 11:04.464
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a bit of a slow news week.

11:05.245 --> 11:10.569
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a pretty major holiday happen this past week and things that people are celebrating, a lot of people traveling.

11:10.910 --> 11:12.851
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was not a lot of gaming news this week.

11:13.152 --> 11:19.937
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to what there is in a moment, but this is the time of year where a lot of people talk about what was your top games of the year.

11:20.318 --> 11:24.161
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to start that same conversation here at Orange Lounge Radio, the top video games of 2013.

11:25.322 --> 11:29.546
[SPEAKER_04]: But a very important difference, what we're trying to do here, here at Orange Lounge Radio, we want to talk about

11:30.306 --> 11:44.893
[SPEAKER_04]: our or as the case may be your favorite games of 2013 meaning there are no right or wrong answers we're not trying to say this is the list and shut the hell up we'll do that later in list list because that is where we do the scientific list and the way things are

11:45.433 --> 11:48.435
[SPEAKER_04]: But for this, this is just about, hey, these were my favorite.

11:48.895 --> 11:50.716
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's no right or wrong answers.

11:50.796 --> 11:53.417
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to know, like, what were your favorite games of the year?

11:53.698 --> 11:56.219
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatters, if you want to play along, shout them out in the chat room.

11:56.239 --> 11:57.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Your one, two, and three.

11:57.179 --> 11:59.281
[SPEAKER_04]: What were your top three games of 2013?

11:59.441 --> 12:03.543
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, guys, they didn't have to be released in 2013.

12:03.903 --> 12:09.566
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be any time if it was something you really got into this year because it made 2013 for you.

12:09.586 --> 12:09.626
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

12:13.348 --> 12:14.869
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:29.919 --> 12:32.041
[SPEAKER_09]: Fractal, Make Blooms Not War Fractal, Make Blooms Not War

12:52.858 --> 12:56.619
[SPEAKER_04]: That is actually a game I got into a little bit when you sent that to me.

12:56.899 --> 12:59.179
[SPEAKER_04]: I did play a pretty good amount of time one night.

12:59.799 --> 13:02.060
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really kind of different puzzle.

13:02.100 --> 13:05.880
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of the old school games of life that were on the Commodore 64.

13:06.060 --> 13:09.021
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not talking about the board game version with the wheel and the car with the pegs.

13:09.401 --> 13:15.382
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about like this dot will survive if surrounded by other dots, but not too many.

13:15.682 --> 13:18.823
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just see these really very pretty patterns that bloom from that.

13:18.843 --> 13:20.943
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was almost like that idea, like as a puzzler.

13:20.963 --> 13:21.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

13:21.323 --> 13:21.923
[SPEAKER_04]: was really cool.

13:21.943 --> 13:24.464
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, especially with the ambient music that plays in the background.

13:25.304 --> 13:30.765
[SPEAKER_09]: It's... I'm trying to think of the right way to phrase it.

13:32.225 --> 13:33.425
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's it.

13:33.885 --> 13:37.306
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is actually from 2010, believe it or not.

13:37.666 --> 13:44.867
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was offered as parts of bundles in 2012 and 2013, so it kind of came to more prevalence later.

13:44.947 --> 13:47.247
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you what, I have a different game that did come out this year.

13:47.908 --> 13:49.628
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's Legend of Zelda Late Between Worlds.

13:50.048 --> 13:50.488
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay.

13:50.848 --> 13:52.189
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

14:07.276 --> 14:08.657
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, but it still makes me motion sick.

14:08.997 --> 14:09.838
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't use it that often.

14:09.918 --> 14:18.084
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually very disorienting, especially when you're... I love the switch in perspective when you jump from a higher plane to a lower plane.

14:18.764 --> 14:21.566
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the camera actually moves with you just a little bit.

14:22.647 --> 14:25.669
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, I've been completely enjoying it.

14:25.749 --> 14:27.511
[SPEAKER_09]: That game is definitely on my list.

14:28.211 --> 14:29.192
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

14:29.232 --> 14:29.652
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

14:29.732 --> 14:31.794
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I want to stick with stuff that came out this year.

14:32.214 --> 14:32.774
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

14:32.815 --> 14:34.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

14:34.556 --> 14:36.037
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's your number three pick?

14:37.117 --> 14:43.641
[SPEAKER_12]: My number three pick is going to be probably... It's kind of a toss-up.

14:44.082 --> 14:46.223
[SPEAKER_12]: It almost sounds like a three-way tie for number three.

14:46.443 --> 14:48.404
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a time to talk about honorable mentions later.

14:49.145 --> 14:50.245
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so let's see.

14:50.446 --> 14:57.370
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll probably do... I was going to go by how long I played games, but let's do Saints Row 4.

14:57.570 --> 14:57.750
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

14:59.431 --> 15:00.412
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because it was...

15:01.054 --> 15:06.617
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Saints Row, but it was a little bit of a disappointment just because it seemed like it was kind of rushed.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.438
[SPEAKER_12]: But I still enjoyed it.

15:09.678 --> 15:18.102
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just frustrating that I know it, having played all of the entire series, I know how good it could be.

15:18.442 --> 15:24.945
[SPEAKER_12]: It's disappointing to see that it didn't quite make it there, mainly to where Saints Row 2 and 3 would have been.

15:25.445 --> 15:29.607
[SPEAKER_12]: It had potential, so hopefully the next Saints Row that comes out will be much better, but

15:30.263 --> 15:30.944
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still pretty good.

15:31.925 --> 15:32.285
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

15:32.846 --> 15:36.049
[SPEAKER_04]: And you did talk an awful lot about that game, all the good and the bad.

15:36.509 --> 15:38.852
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't surprise me at all that that is in your top three.

15:40.153 --> 15:42.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, I don't know if you were wanting to do this tonight.

15:42.936 --> 15:45.858
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you tend to play a lot more of the phone games, the classics.

15:45.898 --> 15:47.400
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have three games from this year?

15:47.780 --> 15:55.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, based off going, like the only way I can really gauge it is going based off the kind of things that I've been talking about a lot, and I think I've come up with a 1, 2, and 3.

15:55.827 --> 15:56.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

15:56.548 --> 16:09.339
[SPEAKER_02]: So, number 3, I'm going to give to FTL, Faster Than Light, because I've not had, like, despite how much I complain about that game, if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be playing it.

16:10.459 --> 16:13.480
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, it's not particularly puzzly.

16:13.680 --> 16:35.086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of Twitch action because it's overriding theme more than anything else is management of individuals because the pathfinding, yeah, whatever, the attacking isn't exactly... You can drill down and make things a little bit more difficult and a little bit more complicated and directed, but it's just a good...

16:36.906 --> 16:38.389
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to call it a godsend.

16:38.489 --> 16:47.928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to pin down, but it's just a satisfying, nearly mindless, but not if you don't want it to be kind of adventure game.

16:48.277 --> 16:49.678
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I need to check this game out.

16:49.698 --> 16:53.439
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of those games I've always been meaning to check out, especially because it's sort of like a roguelike.

16:53.920 --> 16:57.101
[SPEAKER_04]: But just to be clear, this game was released in September of 2012.

16:57.601 --> 17:00.463
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it really doesn't matter.

17:00.483 --> 17:03.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, like how many games, and you know, it's so funny.

17:04.224 --> 17:07.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was it on Twitter posted their top 10?

17:07.386 --> 17:08.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Who does Twisted Metal?

17:08.626 --> 17:09.166
[SPEAKER_04]: David Jaffe?

17:09.327 --> 17:09.767
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that his name?

17:10.847 --> 17:11.728
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy does Twisted Metal.

17:11.828 --> 17:12.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

17:12.768 --> 17:13.669
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's him.

17:14.309 --> 17:15.630
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how to pronounce his last name.

17:15.990 --> 17:24.156
[SPEAKER_04]: He posted his top 10 of the year, and Sonic Racing, the one that came out last year technically, the one with Danica Packard and all that.

17:24.316 --> 17:30.700
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic All-Stars Adventure Racing, whatever was in his list, and everybody was like, you idiot, that came out in 2012, boo.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.122
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like, okay, but there's so many games.

17:34.283 --> 17:35.984
[SPEAKER_04]: How big is your backlog, people?

17:36.024 --> 17:39.286
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still games like Stanley Parable I just said, I need to get around to playing that still.

17:39.526 --> 17:42.487
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played less than 25% of my Steam library.

17:42.847 --> 17:43.447
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

17:43.507 --> 17:47.328
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Effect, I did not discover my love for until like four years after the fact.

17:47.368 --> 17:48.648
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, these things happen.

17:48.688 --> 17:50.029
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make very clear.

17:50.309 --> 17:54.810
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not trying to come up with like some journalistic, this is the best of the best.

17:55.130 --> 17:55.490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no.

17:55.510 --> 17:57.631
[SPEAKER_04]: These are our gaming years.

17:57.651 --> 18:00.111
[SPEAKER_02]: And FTL definitely ranked up there quite quick.

18:00.632 --> 18:01.552
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played in a couple of weeks.

18:01.612 --> 18:02.252
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to change that.

18:02.372 --> 18:05.213
[SPEAKER_04]: When we get that tweet that's like, why did Jason put a 2012 game on his list?

18:05.253 --> 18:06.033
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ballistic.

18:06.113 --> 18:07.194
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say, weren't you listening?

18:07.754 --> 18:08.014
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

18:08.874 --> 18:09.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to all the other words.

18:09.975 --> 18:10.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

18:10.595 --> 18:14.636
[SPEAKER_04]: But you do remind me I need to check that one out as old as the game may be getting at this point.

18:14.656 --> 18:15.737
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still quite fun.

18:15.877 --> 18:16.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Very fun.

18:16.457 --> 18:16.657
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

18:16.677 --> 18:17.077
[SPEAKER_04]: Very fun.

18:17.657 --> 18:18.878
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess just me's left, right?

18:18.938 --> 18:19.098
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

18:19.138 --> 18:19.798
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three pick.

18:20.138 --> 18:25.240
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three pick is Super Mario 3D World on the Wii U, which is...

18:25.961 --> 18:29.685
[SPEAKER_04]: God, the Mario games are damn near always rock solid games.

18:29.805 --> 18:42.000
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a reason why people eat up anything with Mario in the title because especially when it's the main series games, the platformer games, they are almost always, without fail, some of the best games to come out for the year.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.762
[SPEAKER_04]: A few exceptions here and there.

18:44.182 --> 18:47.725
[SPEAKER_04]: but Mario 3D World is by no means an exception.

18:47.765 --> 18:49.226
[SPEAKER_04]: It is one of the best of the year.

18:49.967 --> 18:57.133
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not know how a 3D game was going to go over on the Wii U because it's not in 3D but they made it work out very well.

18:57.433 --> 19:04.819
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the return of the classic styles of Princess Peach and Luigi and so forth from Super Mario 2.

19:05.920 --> 19:10.964
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the level design is fantastic and especially later on it just gets better

19:10.964 --> 19:11.364
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

19:34.346 --> 19:36.708
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:04.502 --> 20:08.023
[SPEAKER_09]: because that game sort of snuck up on me and I'll tell you how I heard about it.

20:08.503 --> 20:10.064
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually through a parody.

20:10.644 --> 20:15.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really a parody, but it was a response to an email that the game creator had about it.

20:16.386 --> 20:23.868
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he had the narrator narrate the response and the letter about this guy being a major douchebag who emailed about it.

20:24.148 --> 20:26.269
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, why did you say Stanley so many times?

20:27.253 --> 20:28.454
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

20:55.911 --> 21:00.912
[SPEAKER_09]: I just sort of, you know, try to do stuff now to spite the narrator and it's so fun.

21:01.673 --> 21:03.393
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Stanley Parable gets my number two.

21:03.953 --> 21:15.776
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have like a little sarcastic antagonist slash protagonist slash do I root for this bad guy or not type character like you had in Portal for sure, I notice you tend to love those types as a lot of people do.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.337
[SPEAKER_04]: So that doesn't surprise me at all.

21:17.957 --> 21:21.619
[SPEAKER_09]: I like games that are mockeries of other things.

21:21.759 --> 21:27.862
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big fan of satire, and it seems to me that a great deal... I mean, well, hello, I like Homestuck.

21:28.723 --> 21:34.005
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, I like anything that is both a satire and homage to a genre.

21:34.425 --> 21:41.669
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been having a good time with The Stanley Parable, and I think that it's something that if you haven't played yet, you definitely need to play it.

21:42.226 --> 21:47.087
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in our chatroom saying, playing the Stanley Parable makes me kind of anxious, but it's so good.

21:47.408 --> 21:48.228
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is good.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.188
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a great game.

21:49.728 --> 21:56.990
[SPEAKER_09]: And that, and I just want to send a message to, we should get the narrator from the Stanley Parable to do a bumper for us.

21:57.310 --> 21:59.011
[SPEAKER_04]: If they would, I would love that.

21:59.091 --> 22:01.651
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be amazing for the VOG Network.

22:01.812 --> 22:04.952
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Zones Radio asked me to do a bumper, and I said, well, sure.

22:06.713 --> 22:07.453
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent, excellent.

22:08.333 --> 22:08.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's up next?

22:08.833 --> 22:09.394
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Loki?

22:09.454 --> 22:10.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's your number two pick?

22:11.223 --> 22:13.545
[SPEAKER_12]: My number two is going to be Bioshock Infinite.

22:15.466 --> 22:23.632
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a great game and had a lot of moments in it where it was just very awe-inspiring, I guess.

22:24.152 --> 22:29.196
[SPEAKER_12]: And the ending was very satisfying, I guess.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.598
[SPEAKER_12]: So definitely Bioshock Infinite for number two.

22:33.639 --> 22:34.800
[SPEAKER_09]: I like games that have moments.

22:36.441 --> 22:38.222
[SPEAKER_12]: The very beginning, you don't even have to wait that long.

22:39.043 --> 22:41.004
[SPEAKER_12]: Within the first two minutes, it's just like,

22:41.519 --> 22:43.616
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoa, that's pretty powerful.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.022
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I didn't want to get into my gaming week too much.

22:47.042 --> 22:52.466
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to save this for a little later, but I will say I did finally jump in and play Bioshock Infinite for the first time this week.

22:53.567 --> 22:57.890
[SPEAKER_04]: I was lucky enough to get it as a gift on Steam, and I was like, all right, it's about freaking time I finally play this game.

22:58.430 --> 23:03.314
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was blown away by the graphics.

23:03.554 --> 23:05.275
[SPEAKER_04]: They are so good.

23:05.495 --> 23:11.780
[SPEAKER_04]: And the atmosphere of the Columbia is fantastic.

23:11.820 --> 23:14.282
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, I played the first Bioshock, and I was like, oh, this is...

23:14.562 --> 23:23.409
[SPEAKER_04]: This is alright, and I see why people are into it, you know, the more the story unfolded and so forth, but this one just, not to be crass, but it had me by the balls from the very beginning.

23:23.449 --> 23:39.381
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so good, and the way the environment is and all the things to look at and the story behind it, like, DarkSakura, I think if you could handle the first-person shooter, I mean, it's unfortunate, you know, you have the sickness, but I think you'd be really into this, too, because there's so much of the lore.

23:39.401 --> 23:40.562
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have the sickness.

23:41.063 --> 23:42.764
[SPEAKER_04]: The lore and the culture with it is just...

23:43.084 --> 23:44.784
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know I want to play it.

23:44.904 --> 23:45.544
[SPEAKER_09]: I have it.

23:45.684 --> 23:47.565
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had it for a while.

23:48.205 --> 23:49.585
[SPEAKER_09]: So I definitely want to.

23:49.725 --> 23:53.466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... There's some very uncomfortable things.

23:53.506 --> 23:56.206
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of you guys have probably heard about the controversies in the game and so forth.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.807
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some very uncomfortable things in there about America's history.

23:58.827 --> 23:59.227
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Alabama.

23:59.267 --> 23:59.827
[SPEAKER_09]: I can deal with it.

23:59.967 --> 24:12.109
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but it's done in a very tasteful way for a story that pushes it forward without it being shocking, if that makes sense.

24:12.990 --> 24:14.031
[SPEAKER_04]: It is shocking.

24:14.091 --> 24:15.753
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed really realistic to me.

24:16.073 --> 24:26.665
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you've ever looked at any photos from America's history, or even not just America, but other places in the world, it's something that it's very period specific.

24:27.813 --> 24:49.627
[SPEAKER_04]: so unfortunately it didn't make my top three probably because I got into it too late in the year but it would definitely be one of my honorable mentions of a late add to my list but anyway Loki not to derail what you were saying but it's just I I had to get that out there that I played it this week and I was just I was I was so in love with it it's it's great okay all right I know do you have anything to add Loki

24:50.402 --> 24:52.003
[SPEAKER_04]: All the DLC was this year

25:13.257 --> 25:24.486
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's actually what I'm basing this off of is that I made a point a couple of episodes ago back when the PS4 was coming out or just after the Xbox One was out, one of the two, close enough together.

25:24.686 --> 25:42.721
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, one of the things that's been really interesting to me is that because online is ubiquitous everywhere, we are truly starting to see video game communities in the video game and not, you know, like fan forums and that kind of stuff that has a very serious disconnect from the game.

25:43.962 --> 25:48.425
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep wanting to say Bioshock because we were going on and on about that and I want to play that too.

25:48.485 --> 25:55.931
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Borderlands is multiplayer and has a lot of work put into it to make sure that the experience of playing together is good.

25:56.471 --> 26:05.238
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention the randomness of the loot and the DLC and the keys that Shift gives out and everything else that's going into that game.

26:05.679 --> 26:09.081
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of video game communities but Borderlands 2...

26:10.282 --> 26:19.874
[SPEAKER_02]: is the first one that I know of that's console specific that's putting in a lot of work into maintaining original content and the health of that community at large.

26:20.458 --> 26:20.738
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lich King

26:45.769 --> 26:45.929
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

26:46.309 --> 26:46.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Close.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn is my number two pick for Game of the Year.

26:50.490 --> 26:55.972
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 was one of the most awful MMOs ever made.

26:56.172 --> 26:56.992
[SPEAKER_04]: That is no secret.

26:57.573 --> 27:04.975
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fact that they were able to bring in a new producer who has worked utter magic with this because not only was he able to take...

27:05.655 --> 27:06.536
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:24.238 --> 27:30.222
[SPEAKER_04]: Back the car into the spot, so to speak, of, oh, but we've got to make sure 1.0 kind of continues into this.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.563
[SPEAKER_04]: And the things that everybody started at 1.0 have to carry over.

27:32.984 --> 27:36.746
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a miracle in gaming that they did with that game.

27:36.786 --> 27:38.907
[SPEAKER_04]: It is gorgeous to look at.

27:39.007 --> 27:39.808
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun to play.

27:40.328 --> 27:44.731
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is probably going to be one of the best MMOs of this decade.

27:44.751 --> 27:48.954
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you think about it, I mean, World of Warcraft, still have a great love for that community.

27:49.434 --> 27:50.315
[SPEAKER_04]: All love that game.

27:51.135 --> 27:55.340
[SPEAKER_04]: I canceled my account this week, I'm sorry to say, because I've been paying for two MMOs.

27:55.740 --> 28:00.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV, Rome Reborn is where it's at for me right now, and WoW is an eight-year-old game.

28:00.726 --> 28:01.227
[SPEAKER_02]: End of an era.

28:01.467 --> 28:02.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Running on that engine.

28:02.748 --> 28:03.930
[SPEAKER_04]: It is in a way.

28:04.070 --> 28:08.495
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even think the new expansion is going to be enough to make me want to go back.

28:08.655 --> 28:36.507
[SPEAKER_04]: it's one of those I'll check it out but we'll see and it's just you know I'm so excited about like a lot of the stuff that's going on in A Realm Reborn right now especially with the latest patch and so forth it's just like I think it is kind of the end of an era just as and to be fair before the angry blizzard mob comes at me with their pitchforks and torches just as I when I left Final Fantasy 11 to go to World of Warcraft that was the end of an era you know this is what's next the pendulum has swung and now we're on the other side

28:37.458 --> 28:40.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I mention the soundtrack is so flippin' good?

28:40.939 --> 28:43.480
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you get tired of listening to the Chocobo music the whole time.

28:43.800 --> 28:56.766
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have actually been playing Final Fantasy XIV right before this very show tonight, and I was running a Titan Kill, which those of you that have played the game know you have to kill the... I'm not even talking about the level 35 one, I'm talking about the one... See, that's the one I'm on right now.

28:56.786 --> 28:57.626
[SPEAKER_04]: The one at level 50?

28:58.186 --> 28:58.686
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

28:59.187 --> 29:00.427
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, look up a YouTube of the fight.

29:00.507 --> 29:01.007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

29:01.127 --> 29:03.908
[SPEAKER_04]: And the music is like this rock song that's like...

29:05.729 --> 29:29.628
[SPEAKER_04]: that's like death metal that plays in the background and it's like your heart is beating so fast like I know Alan could probably hear me from the other room like every time I got hit with something I shouldn't have it's like fuck motherfucker piece of shit god damn you know it's just like I have Tourette's or something sitting there playing this game but I'm just like that into it and I was playing with a fun group of people uh funny enough um uh Darlena who's one of the hosts over on all games of um

29:30.508 --> 29:31.908
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to mess up the name of this show.

29:31.948 --> 29:32.829
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so embarrassed.

29:32.889 --> 29:39.170
[SPEAKER_04]: Kat and Fox, I think she's one of the hosts of that show, I was playing with in a group, and we were having a lot of fun.

29:39.830 --> 29:43.871
[SPEAKER_04]: And I helped one of their friends get a Titan weapon, or Relic plus one, so that was good.

29:44.591 --> 29:53.853
[SPEAKER_12]: That was actually fun with Final Fantasy XI was changing up the music because you could kind of mod it a little bit and add your own tracks and where different songs were.

29:54.073 --> 29:58.014
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had Otherworld from Final Fantasy X as my fight...

29:58.530 --> 29:59.310
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

30:13.407 --> 30:18.929
[SPEAKER_04]: SSU100 Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, You kept wondering what would be the WoW killer for many years.

30:19.109 --> 30:22.570
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you feel that Final Fantasy XIV killed it or did WoW kill itself?

30:23.190 --> 30:25.591
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think WoW is dead by a long shot.

30:25.671 --> 30:27.492
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they hemorrhaging subscribers in a way?

30:27.672 --> 30:27.912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.313
[SPEAKER_04]: But are they still the biggest MMO four times over?

30:30.493 --> 30:31.013
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

30:31.353 --> 30:33.254
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's still a great community over there.

30:33.794 --> 30:35.515
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be finally tired of the game.

30:35.635 --> 30:39.036
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that regard, yes, WoW is killing itself because it's not...

30:39.736 --> 30:41.537
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not innovating fast enough.

31:00.843 --> 31:19.210
[SPEAKER_04]: and I know Blizzard has a reputation of it will get out there when it's done and when we rush things something like what happened with Diablo 3 will happen and I understand that but you look at something like Hearthstone as well Hearthstone is a great game it is moving too slow why is that game still in beta?

31:19.530 --> 31:19.790
[SPEAKER_04]: why?

31:20.390 --> 31:44.471
[SPEAKER_04]: are they they're still balancing things really it is moving too slow it is time to open up that beta and just just open launch the damn game is it if you have to still balance some cards is it really that big of an issue because most MMOs out there still need fixing but I mean it's not I think the game's in fine enough shape and it's not even just MMOs Blizzard's entire catalog is balanced once every month basically

31:44.651 --> 32:12.576
[SPEAKER_04]: and this may just be the difference that 10 years makes or whatever where that whole mantra for Blizzard where it's like oh we'll just take time until it's right I'm not saying don't take the time to get it right but I'm saying move a little faster you guys I'm sorry it's just that's the reality they're not moving fast enough I don't think anything's changed in that regard I think they still can take their time because they have three solid IPs that are not they're by no means close to danger

32:12.856 --> 32:15.777
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fair point, because does it work for Diablo?

32:15.837 --> 32:16.077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

32:16.257 --> 32:16.777
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft?

32:16.837 --> 32:17.017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

32:17.177 --> 32:17.657
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearthstone?

32:17.697 --> 32:17.877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

32:18.278 --> 32:21.178
[SPEAKER_02]: A game where you're asking... I actually wasn't counting Hearthstone.

32:21.519 --> 32:22.219
[SPEAKER_02]: You said it yourself.

32:22.299 --> 32:23.239
[SPEAKER_02]: WoW is still strong.

32:23.599 --> 32:27.360
[SPEAKER_02]: But between WoW, Diablo, and StarCraft, they are very healthy right now.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strong, but it is losing steam.

32:29.841 --> 32:33.502
[SPEAKER_04]: And the difference there is you are asking people to pay a monthly fee for World of Warcraft.

32:33.702 --> 32:38.884
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like... And not only that, but then you nickel and dime them with the server changes, which...

32:41.225 --> 32:41.565
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

32:41.605 --> 32:42.826
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV does it too.

32:42.926 --> 32:44.067
[SPEAKER_04]: They make their money or whatever.

32:44.668 --> 32:48.511
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just think it's moving too slow.

32:48.891 --> 32:51.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you want me to pay for eight months while I wait for an expansion?

32:51.793 --> 32:54.656
[SPEAKER_04]: Like no, I'll quit and then maybe if the expansion is good I'll come back at that point.

32:55.557 --> 32:56.177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the reality.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.420
[SPEAKER_02]: By which you mean you will come back for at least a month to find out.

32:59.500 --> 33:00.341
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.

33:00.401 --> 33:01.301
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

33:01.662 --> 33:01.942
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

33:04.053 --> 33:05.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, moving on.

33:05.694 --> 33:06.514
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to number one.

33:06.534 --> 33:07.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one!

33:07.394 --> 33:09.034
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, numero uno.

33:09.814 --> 33:13.815
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your number one pick for game of the year.

33:14.595 --> 33:15.336
[SPEAKER_09]: Animal Crossing.

33:16.936 --> 33:18.356
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I not surprised?

33:18.716 --> 33:21.277
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played this game, like, addictive.

33:21.797 --> 33:22.537
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so crazy.

33:23.817 --> 33:25.498
[SPEAKER_09]: I have friends that play with me.

33:25.778 --> 33:26.398
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Actdeft.

33:28.194 --> 33:29.134
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

33:48.360 --> 33:59.306
[SPEAKER_09]: and I was thinking about it too that, you know, I've been using it to help Julian with his reading and to bribe him into paying attention to other people but it's got appeal for all ages.

33:59.586 --> 34:01.987
[SPEAKER_09]: I really have been enjoying my game.

34:02.928 --> 34:04.889
[SPEAKER_09]: I also may have finished my wine before you did.

34:05.589 --> 34:06.230
[SPEAKER_09]: Like all of it.

34:07.270 --> 34:07.931
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really good.

34:09.471 --> 34:10.312
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, wine!

34:11.716 --> 34:13.277
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your number one pick of the year

34:38.576 --> 34:39.718
[SPEAKER_12]: We wouldn't want you to die.

34:39.838 --> 34:42.842
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, it is going to be Grand Theft Auto V. Of course!

34:43.062 --> 34:43.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course!

34:44.484 --> 34:45.446
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, what else would it be?

34:45.886 --> 34:48.951
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, it is a great game and I love it.

34:49.071 --> 34:51.935
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're still making it better.

34:52.916 --> 34:53.297
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

34:53.938 --> 34:55.380
[SPEAKER_12]: Grand Theft Auto V. Not a surprise.

34:55.802 --> 35:02.664
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to know more about why Loki picked Grand Theft Auto V as his game of the year, just go back to the previous 15 episodes of the show or so since the game came out.

35:03.524 --> 35:05.365
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I was going to say exactly the same thing.

35:05.625 --> 35:06.005
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

35:06.665 --> 35:09.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, you're number uno, number one.

35:10.046 --> 35:16.148
[SPEAKER_02]: If for no other reason than because of the last two weeks, definitely, certainly, completely Rogue Legacy.

35:17.808 --> 35:22.410
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been having, especially with a controller now, like it was always a fun game on the keyboard.

35:23.450 --> 35:47.786
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just kind of live for that adventure, random, twitch, roguelike, platformer just all things together, the music and everything else I've been having so much fun with that game throw in a controller, I've been using the PS4 controller religiously like every day since I've started, since I got it and actually got it to work it's been insane amounts of fun and I'm thinking that when it's out on...

35:49.227 --> 36:10.373
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking when it's out on two systems that I don't have and one system back home that I'll get back to eventually, those being the PS Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, I may buy it again because just to have the console experience from the ground up, not to mention there's some very, very frustrating Mac bugs with Rogue Legacy, but besides the point...

36:12.393 --> 36:41.777
[SPEAKER_02]: more specifically I've had a conversation with a friend or two in the last couple of days I kind of want to get a Vita for a number of reasons and that's basically Playstation 1 classics and some of the newer games being able to play them portably just seems like a worthy investment and that's always what it is for me with consoles rather with portables is that when I can play something anywhere I love to be able to do so and Rogue Legacy may tip me into that purchase and so for that very reason that's my number one pick

36:43.178 --> 36:47.323
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure did.

36:47.843 --> 36:48.604
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great pick.

36:48.884 --> 36:49.465
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

36:50.626 --> 36:56.733
[SPEAKER_02]: I was listening to the show on the way up here, of course, and I was listening to you and Bobby talking about it in the handoff, and...

36:57.708 --> 37:01.349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's... Like anything else, it kind of has that first little hurdle.

37:03.029 --> 37:06.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Grinding pays off and this game doesn't stretch it out unreasonably.

37:07.590 --> 37:15.232
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's actually... It's coming around a second time because I'm at a point where I like to clear the entirety of the areas.

37:15.972 --> 37:23.154
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted a screenshot to Steam two nights ago or something like that that I finally, for the first time...

37:23.954 --> 37:24.574
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

37:46.684 --> 38:03.139
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a good place right now it's a good way further than I am that's for sure and it's just managing the upgrades and figuring out how I want to proceed from there and finally taking on the third boss and holding my own for more than like 30 seconds but yeah very fun game and so much fun

38:03.866 --> 38:04.166
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

38:05.227 --> 38:08.270
[SPEAKER_04]: My number one game of the year will probably not come as a huge surprise.

38:08.830 --> 38:20.800
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I mentioned on November 23rd, which was the day that the Xbox One came out, I said, isn't it funny that Nintendo today released two games that are damn near contenders for the game of the year?

38:21.361 --> 38:24.824
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, both those games released ended up in my top three.

38:24.864 --> 38:29.768
[SPEAKER_04]: You had Super Mario 3D World at number three, and The Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds, at number one.

38:29.828 --> 38:30.809
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that game...

38:31.629 --> 38:33.310
[SPEAKER_04]: is my fucking game of the year.

38:35.011 --> 38:38.073
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think some of this is a little bit personal as well.

38:39.154 --> 38:48.119
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that some big outlets put it in their number one to such controversy, but good for them because it's my number one too.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.221
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to tell you, the way that they took...

38:52.322 --> 38:56.467
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my top five retro favorites of all time, period.

38:57.147 --> 39:07.738
[SPEAKER_04]: And brought it into not like a remake or even a reimagining, but just another story, a chapter two in that game that you love, but now...

39:08.439 --> 39:11.081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got all that new technology of the current console.

39:11.441 --> 39:19.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the way that it moved seamlessly from Super Nintendo to 3DS is just... It's so right.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.408
[SPEAKER_04]: And it feels so great to play.

39:22.028 --> 39:23.889
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love some of the changes they made to it.

39:23.909 --> 39:28.773
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of the things were controversial where you rent the weapons now and you can do the dungeons in any order.

39:28.793 --> 39:30.674
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's cool.

39:30.794 --> 39:32.235
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it makes for a different...

39:32.695 --> 39:35.077
[SPEAKER_04]: and more Mega Man-esque Legend of Zelda, if you will.

39:35.117 --> 39:36.739
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's something a little bit different.

39:37.059 --> 39:39.101
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is such a fun adventure to play.

39:39.361 --> 39:42.283
[SPEAKER_04]: And I loved every second of it that I've played it.

39:42.483 --> 39:49.970
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a Link to the Past wink for me that I loved.

39:50.290 --> 39:54.593
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, yeah, fantastic game in my game of the year.

39:54.814 --> 39:58.697
[SPEAKER_09]: For the record, you could actually do two of the levels in Link to the Past out of order.

40:00.453 --> 40:04.095
[SPEAKER_04]: The Last of Us, Hands Down, My Game of the Year, The Game Speaks for Itself

40:29.632 --> 40:33.133
[SPEAKER_04]: Tech2030 says, Tales of Xillia, for sure.

40:33.333 --> 40:37.975
[SPEAKER_04]: I clocked in like 50 hours in that game, and I'm about to go back in for a second time.

40:38.895 --> 40:43.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see some other number ones here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

40:45.638 --> 40:48.399
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got mixed in with the number twos here.

40:48.559 --> 40:51.920
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a bunch of people that did theirs in bulk at the start of all this.

40:52.020 --> 41:17.479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's where I got to SG-100, Matt agrees, Grand Theft Auto 5 Degenerate Johnny says Dark Souls Code Man says Super Mario 3D World and Dark Tetsuya says Super Mario 3D World So there's a sampling of some of the answers there in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Open forum for a minute Honorable mentions, some games that didn't make your top three but they really deserve a shout out here as well Jamie

41:18.697 --> 41:20.178
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna say the stupid Pokemon.

41:21.619 --> 41:27.244
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because it was the first ones that I actually wanted in a while, and I'm having fun with it so far.

41:27.324 --> 41:27.885
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cute.

41:28.105 --> 41:29.226
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Pokemon.

41:29.626 --> 41:30.567
[SPEAKER_09]: I like roller skates.

41:31.848 --> 41:35.351
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like that every time you accidentally bump into a chair, you sit on it.

41:36.092 --> 41:37.833
[SPEAKER_09]: But other than that, I'm not too frustrated with.

41:37.993 --> 41:39.675
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also don't like the 50,007 Pikachus.

41:39.695 --> 41:40.535
[SPEAKER_09]: 57,000 Pikachus.

41:43.698 --> 41:44.699
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted a Pikachu.

41:44.719 --> 41:48.062
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one that people want, so why not give it to them?

41:48.182 --> 41:51.445
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you see nothing but Pikachu for another year.

41:51.665 --> 41:53.387
[SPEAKER_04]: True, and that's all that's in the world trade.

41:54.047 --> 41:57.090
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you mentioned you were trying to decide between a few games there.

41:57.110 --> 41:58.091
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your honorable mentions?

41:59.292 --> 42:01.974
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

42:02.875 --> 42:03.476
[SPEAKER_09]: I just bought that.

42:04.717 --> 42:05.317
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks pretty awesome.

42:05.337 --> 42:09.241
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I bought that too, and then I was like, I have to do Uplay.

42:09.881 --> 42:10.782
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot about that.

42:11.617 --> 42:25.975
[SPEAKER_12]: um and then let's see the Stanley Parable probably be another one um oh that's pretty much it Jason because I couldn't find a place for it in the top three and just because it

42:27.756 --> 42:28.917
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another game, Little Inferno

42:56.548 --> 43:12.434
[SPEAKER_09]: You were talking a lot about that game when it first came out, I remember that I mean, it's worth a playthrough at least once The combos are hilarious But once you get past that, it's sort of like weird But it was really fun, I liked it Oh, and Limbo Limbo was fun

43:14.201 --> 43:30.536
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to note for some honorable mentions I have as well I don't know if you have some extras Jason but some honorable mentions I have as well I think the first half of this year was usually the first half of the year is not as strong as it was this year but we had some great games just in the first three months of this year

43:31.116 --> 43:32.177
[SPEAKER_04]: and many, many more.

43:56.516 --> 44:07.299
[SPEAKER_04]: and is making a lot of people's year-end list and with good reason because it was so great to finally... It's like you play a game like Tomb Raider and you're like, yes, this is the Tomb Raider I wanted to play.

44:07.399 --> 44:08.259
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

44:08.279 --> 44:11.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomb Raider is definitely the most... Yeah, and it looks gorgeous.

44:11.540 --> 44:16.121
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, for one, I'm kind of excited about the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One version.

44:16.141 --> 44:20.482
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yes, it's a little weird to have a remake of a game that was just out, but at the same time, it's like...

44:20.902 --> 44:24.583
[SPEAKER_04]: With even more power, I'm really excited to see what they're going to pull off.

44:24.883 --> 44:27.344
[SPEAKER_04]: So I loved Tomb Raider.

44:27.564 --> 44:28.884
[SPEAKER_09]: I do need to add another one on my list, too.

44:29.184 --> 44:29.684
[SPEAKER_09]: Skullgirls.

44:30.345 --> 44:30.825
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course.

44:30.865 --> 44:31.445
[SPEAKER_04]: For fighting games.

44:31.485 --> 44:32.285
[SPEAKER_09]: That one was really fun.

44:32.585 --> 44:32.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

44:33.606 --> 44:34.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, any others?

44:34.346 --> 44:37.627
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean to cut you off a minute ago, but Hotline Miami.

44:38.467 --> 44:38.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good one.

44:38.807 --> 44:39.987
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I haven't put enough time into.

44:40.948 --> 44:42.568
[SPEAKER_09]: I just bought that for Dan because it was a dollar.

44:44.447 --> 44:46.028
[SPEAKER_04]: More things to throw out in the chat room here.

44:46.588 --> 44:46.908
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

44:46.948 --> 44:47.809
[SPEAKER_04]: Some honorable mentions.

44:47.869 --> 44:57.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeon Buster says Metal Gear Solid Revengeance, Tomb Raider, Tech 2030 says Ni No Kuni, Tomb Raider, Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite were all first three months.

44:57.655 --> 44:58.596
[SPEAKER_04]: That was crazy.

44:59.236 --> 45:02.859
[SPEAKER_04]: Cialis' Pokemon XY, SteamWorld Dig, Team Fortress 2.

45:02.979 --> 45:04.320
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still a lot of people.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.821
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there are still a lot of people playing that.

45:06.241 --> 45:08.983
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome Unicorn, Guacamelee.

45:09.003 --> 45:10.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Guacamelee is great fun.

45:11.024 --> 45:13.346
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura, you mentioned you just bought that.

45:14.076 --> 45:15.818
[SPEAKER_09]: Shadowrun Returns, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition

45:35.061 --> 45:39.383
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt, Don't Starve, Poker Night 2, Pokemon XY, and DuckTales Remastered.

45:39.443 --> 45:40.883
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, DuckTales.

45:41.063 --> 45:45.445
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as the cutscene thing bothered me, the game was a lot of fun.

45:46.405 --> 45:48.906
[SPEAKER_04]: And the new level was frustratingly hard.

45:49.406 --> 45:51.747
[SPEAKER_09]: I have another game that is definitely an honorable mention.

45:53.067 --> 45:53.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

45:53.827 --> 45:56.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Vesuvius was crazy.

45:56.568 --> 45:57.909
[SPEAKER_09]: This is because of my heart.

45:59.949 --> 46:00.670
[SPEAKER_09]: Namco High.

46:01.070 --> 46:01.190
[SPEAKER_09]: Shh.

46:02.395 --> 46:03.375
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously!

46:04.055 --> 46:08.237
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like such a... You know me and parodies and satires and tributes and things.

46:08.897 --> 46:10.017
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking love that game.

46:10.217 --> 46:13.038
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me laugh every time I play it.

46:13.358 --> 46:23.561
[SPEAKER_09]: Just knowing the characters from the obscure Namco titles and the Homestuck characters in it and playing as the cousin of the Prince of All Cosmos.

46:24.321 --> 46:27.962
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so crazy that it's stupidly fun.

46:28.302 --> 46:32.923
[SPEAKER_09]: Not quite enough to make it into my top three, but definitely has a warm, fuzzy place in my heart.

46:33.723 --> 46:34.063
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

46:35.323 --> 46:36.263
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, good discussion.

46:36.323 --> 46:36.903
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of great games.

46:36.923 --> 46:38.404
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very good year for games.

46:38.584 --> 46:45.725
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, you get two new consoles, and I'm sure they're going to really start to roll out some of the heavy hitters next year and the year after.

46:45.785 --> 46:48.065
[SPEAKER_02]: We already know that because of the delays, unfortunately.

46:48.305 --> 46:48.565
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

46:48.605 --> 46:51.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year is going to be a great resurgence...

46:52.386 --> 46:53.467
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our poor wallets, collectively.

47:14.898 --> 47:16.719
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, you have things on PlayStation 4.

47:17.120 --> 47:21.262
[SPEAKER_04]: You have, what was that, The Order, the one about the wolves and all that that looked really cool.

47:21.402 --> 47:22.303
[SPEAKER_04]: They were shown at E3.

47:22.623 --> 47:25.565
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have Infamous Second Son is next year as well.

47:25.645 --> 47:27.326
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of great stuff on PlayStation.

47:27.346 --> 47:27.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Drive Club.

47:28.247 --> 47:29.868
[SPEAKER_04]: Drive Club finally coming next year.

47:30.328 --> 47:34.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox One has the Quantum Break, the new Halo.

47:34.691 --> 47:36.292
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's going to be the holiday thing next year.

47:37.433 --> 47:38.974
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of great things on there as well.

47:39.034 --> 47:42.116
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I'm sure the current-gen consoles aren't stopping either.

47:42.557 --> 47:44.658
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be another Mass Effect game.

47:45.000 --> 48:12.386
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course Nintendo on Planet Nintendo where they do things Nintendo's way they will have Mario Kart 8 is going to be huge a lot of people theorizing they'll at least tease the next Zelda if it's not out next holiday Smash Brothers will probably be a big holiday one for sure and who knows what else from Planet Nintendo I expect that game to be more like mid-year there's no way they're going to take it to holiday season next year but maybe we should save predictions for later

48:13.266 --> 48:14.026
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

48:35.385 --> 49:03.879
[SPEAKER_09]: I played some stuff Animal Crossing and I played some Final Fantasy 14 and I got some of my old school friends into Final Fantasy 14 people from my Digimon days and stuff and words and other games I bought a bunch of games that I haven't started I played some Fractal I played some Mass Effect 3 I played some Mass Effect 2 because basically I have a new computer

49:04.918 --> 49:07.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that was your holiday gift, huh?

49:08.082 --> 49:10.885
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really the computer, the guts in it are new.

49:11.005 --> 49:12.967
[SPEAKER_09]: The case, the motherboard, the processor.

49:13.828 --> 49:19.033
[SPEAKER_09]: The only things that we carried over from my old computer were my graphics card, my power supply, and my hard drive.

49:19.874 --> 49:22.317
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I already have a 3TB external storage as well.

49:23.057 --> 49:23.097
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha!

49:49.692 --> 50:12.584
[SPEAKER_09]: with my new processor and everything the installs like they don't take long at all because first of all we have our own router so we get better speeds with our router and everything and then my computer is so fast now that and then Dan just took all the old guts and threw together a new computer because we had the extras he's like let's give this one to my mom there you go

50:14.318 --> 50:14.838
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what he said.

50:15.879 --> 50:20.381
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I've just been playing just random things, really.

50:20.601 --> 50:21.882
[SPEAKER_09]: And more Namco High.

50:22.902 --> 50:24.223
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that game is crack.

50:26.084 --> 50:26.904
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.

50:27.845 --> 50:28.565
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how about you?

50:28.625 --> 50:29.406
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

50:31.186 --> 50:32.547
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I bought a lot of things.

50:34.448 --> 50:35.969
[SPEAKER_12]: I played a few things this week.

50:36.089 --> 50:38.270
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, surprisingly enough, not Grand Theft Auto 4.

50:39.807 --> 51:07.895
[SPEAKER_12]: and that's kind of surprising because they had their holiday thing where they had it snowing and everything and just didn't get a chance to play it that's because it's buried under cores right now I did play I played Duke Nukem forever and it was terrible unfortunately it kept crashing every single level it would crash every single level so after about

51:09.046 --> 51:12.368
[SPEAKER_12]: 7 levels, I said, fuck it, and I installed the game.

51:12.448 --> 51:13.269
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm done with it.

51:13.889 --> 51:15.230
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not good in any way.

51:15.630 --> 51:19.392
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, it's absolutely terrible.

51:20.093 --> 51:21.894
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not what Duke Nukem games should be.

51:22.274 --> 51:23.575
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no point to it.

51:23.855 --> 51:28.058
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like they're more fascinating with, hey, what kind of interactive things can we make?

51:28.518 --> 51:33.501
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, cool, look, we made all these light switches and shit you can do that you don't really need to even mess with.

51:33.541 --> 51:35.202
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the game's just very basic looking.

51:35.803 --> 51:36.624
[SPEAKER_12]: It just looks old.

51:37.044 --> 51:39.005
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how to really describe beyond that.

51:41.106 --> 51:41.947
[SPEAKER_12]: Other things I played.

51:41.967 --> 51:48.211
[SPEAKER_12]: I played a little bit of a brand new game I bought, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.

51:48.431 --> 51:52.193
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, this is an indie game, and it's kind of cool.

51:52.253 --> 52:02.039
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a cross between almost like a 30-second hero and like a shooter and the Oregon Trail.

52:03.067 --> 52:32.332
[SPEAKER_12]: so you're in a wagon like the Oregon Trail and it's like day one you've encountered some wildlife go hunting and so your actual wagon is just shooting out bullets and you have to kill all these things and avoid hitting the animals and stuff and you collect meat that way and it just keeps popping up different random little mini games almost and it's just ridiculous it's a lot of fun and pretty cheap so I played that I played through the Stanley Parable

52:33.150 --> 52:34.811
[SPEAKER_12]: and quite a bit through that.

52:34.831 --> 52:48.896
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I've pretty much finished the game and I've gotten most of the achievements so far aside from some of the ridiculous ones like where you have to mod your date on your computer and stuff.

52:49.817 --> 52:57.340
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, let's see, I played a little bit of Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

52:57.360 --> 52:59.641
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit more of that.

52:59.661 --> 53:00.501
[SPEAKER_12]: That was kind of fun.

53:01.221 --> 53:02.422
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried Proteus

53:02.912 --> 53:11.338
[SPEAKER_12]: which is kind of a very retro-looking 3D first-person, I don't know, art game, I guess.

53:11.398 --> 53:17.382
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not really a point to it, but I was just showing it to Josh because I wanted to show him a game that wasn't scary, I guess.

53:18.202 --> 53:21.564
[SPEAKER_12]: And so he dug that a bit, and it was neat.

53:21.805 --> 53:22.605
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know.

53:22.765 --> 53:23.486
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very short.

53:25.467 --> 53:28.449
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think actually that's it.

53:29.059 --> 53:29.679
[SPEAKER_04]: FarCry3, BloodDragon

53:54.589 --> 54:23.828
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't Starve, Terraria, Left 4 Dead 2 because that was free, Operation Flashpoint Red River, Fuel, Overlord 2, Overlord, Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising, Clive Barker's Jericho, Damnation, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, Super Hexagon, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Rise of the Triad, the new one, Cube, Gateways, Drastic Man Epic, Half-Life Source, kind of as a gift,

54:24.212 --> 54:38.076
[SPEAKER_12]: LaMulana, Blockland, Ballpoint Universe, Infinite, Retrograde, No Way to Love 2, The Evolution, Final Fantasy 7, The Stanley Parable, The Orange Box, and finally, actually from last week, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.

54:38.316 --> 54:38.716
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeez.

54:39.717 --> 54:39.897
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

54:40.177 --> 54:40.797
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good haul.

54:42.698 --> 54:43.938
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was only 60 bucks.

54:45.159 --> 54:46.900
[SPEAKER_04]: So averaging about two bucks a game.

54:48.061 --> 54:48.701
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

54:49.022 --> 54:55.525
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering that's the price of like one new Xbox One or PlayStation 4 game, that's doing really well for yourself.

54:56.126 --> 54:56.346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

54:56.466 --> 54:57.927
[SPEAKER_04]: Hours and hours of entertainment, so why not?

54:58.707 --> 55:01.069
[SPEAKER_04]: And supporting a lot of indie games in there too.

55:01.089 --> 55:06.672
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, my gaming week will be quick because I pretty much already talked about the big new one, which is Bioshock Infinite.

55:06.792 --> 55:08.193
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, I also did buy Dust.

55:08.894 --> 55:09.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did you?

55:09.374 --> 55:11.255
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did.

55:11.375 --> 55:23.862
[SPEAKER_04]: I did also play, besides just Bioshock Infinite, I did some virtual consoling on the Wii U because nobody told me that Legend of the Mystical Ninja had come out on the Wii U. That is like, even, okay.

55:24.682 --> 55:49.317
[SPEAKER_04]: that's one of those games like I loved it when it was out on the Super Nintendo like originally and I love the fact that you know you had the little towns and you had the like mini games you could play in the towns which by the way one of which Gradius you can play Gradius in Legend of the Skull Ninja it's a scaled down version of it but it's there so you know I love that game as a kid playing it now in retrospect I'm kind of like this game was kind of derpy but

55:49.837 --> 55:55.721
[SPEAKER_04]: But I adore it for its derpiness and for some of the things it tried to do.

55:56.362 --> 56:02.646
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a great Miiverse post that is right now the most popular post in the Legend of the Mystical Ninja community.

56:03.126 --> 56:06.228
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a screenshot of me playing Gradius.

56:07.069 --> 56:12.492
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put, look guys, I'm playing a virtual console game inside my virtual console game.

56:12.933 --> 56:14.794
[SPEAKER_04]: It's virtual console-ception, Horn.

56:14.954 --> 56:15.955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got like 25 likes.

56:16.135 --> 56:18.596
[SPEAKER_04]: So my Miiverse moment of fame.

56:18.616 --> 56:18.777
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got 25.

56:18.837 --> 56:18.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

56:20.397 --> 56:21.178
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever it's called.

56:21.218 --> 56:22.178
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's fun.

56:22.898 --> 56:23.199
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

56:23.539 --> 56:24.679
[SPEAKER_09]: How about 55, huh?

56:27.200 --> 56:41.026
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is funny because for the first time ever, I finally got the joke in the game where there's a quiz show game that you can play where it asks you questions about the game in the first couple stages to see if you were paying attention.

56:41.666 --> 56:45.608
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the questions is like, how many legs does the boss have?

56:46.288 --> 56:47.689
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answers are none.

56:48.709 --> 56:49.450
[SPEAKER_04]: 2, and 573.

56:50.110 --> 56:55.033
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the longest time, you know, you think, oh, 573, that's silly because it's a big number.

56:55.053 --> 56:56.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing has 573 legs.

56:56.413 --> 57:00.936
[SPEAKER_04]: But now looking back, you're like, oh, get it?

57:01.936 --> 57:03.977
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, which if you didn't know.

57:04.177 --> 57:05.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Konami.

57:05.538 --> 57:07.099
[SPEAKER_04]: 573 in Japanese.

57:07.199 --> 57:09.780
[SPEAKER_04]: If you abbreviate some things and kind of say it out loud.

57:09.800 --> 57:12.842
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to kind of take some liberties, but it is Konami, basically.

57:12.922 --> 57:14.983
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be Go-na-na-mi-tsu.

57:15.723 --> 57:39.277
[SPEAKER_04]: so there you go but yeah you have to take some liberties but that's why Konami's kind of always married with the number 573 so there you go um let's see I think that was about oh then I also played uh Castlevania and because that came out on virtual console a few weeks ago and I just never picked it up until now and uh yeah that's between that Bioshock Infinite Final Fantasy 14 that was a week so there you go uh last but not least Jason your gaming week

57:40.270 --> 57:40.750
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

58:02.580 --> 58:03.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many, many years ago.

58:03.561 --> 58:05.722
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard much out of her, but I saw something on her wish list.

58:05.762 --> 58:06.362
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I still talk to her.

58:06.462 --> 58:07.223
[SPEAKER_04]: She's still around.

58:07.403 --> 58:07.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

58:07.663 --> 58:10.285
[SPEAKER_04]: She's on Steam, and I just added her on 3DS a couple days ago.

58:10.305 --> 58:13.827
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if she's an active listener anymore, because I think she's just kind of... Just not in the chat.

58:14.247 --> 58:16.729
[SPEAKER_09]: But she does have a very neat blog called The Eco Maker.

58:17.029 --> 58:17.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

58:17.830 --> 58:23.173
[SPEAKER_09]: So check it out, people, because if you're into doing DIY things on the cheap...

58:24.054 --> 58:36.124
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they were, and I don't think she would mind me repeating, they were having some hard times a few months ago, and so, you know, they were really thinking like, you know, how can we do some things short-cutting, so a lot of great ideas in this blog on how to do it on the cheap.

58:36.604 --> 58:37.585
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's a good blog.

58:38.246 --> 58:38.426
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

58:39.006 --> 58:48.449
[SPEAKER_02]: I, amusingly enough, I don't even remember what I sent her, but there was something at a good deal and I saw that it was on her wish list, so I jumped on it and sent it her way.

58:48.749 --> 58:50.230
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of which, you should open your present.

58:50.410 --> 58:51.390
[SPEAKER_02]: I should open my present.

58:52.010 --> 58:54.691
[SPEAKER_02]: A live unboxing, a live un-presenting.

58:55.171 --> 58:56.332
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

59:17.852 --> 59:19.715
[SPEAKER_02]: and it actually has graphics now.

59:19.795 --> 59:20.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Doom RL?

59:20.716 --> 59:21.176
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom RL.

59:21.336 --> 59:21.897
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not heard of this.

59:21.917 --> 59:22.438
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom roguelike.

59:22.578 --> 59:24.880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's surprisingly fun.

59:25.021 --> 59:32.008
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little sad that the levels are, they're very roguelike instead of being very doom-like.

59:32.709 --> 59:36.714
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean that in like classic rogue and, oh Jesus, NetHack.

59:37.554 --> 59:38.235
[SPEAKER_02]: All that kind of stuff.

59:38.255 --> 59:39.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Very classic, very boxy.

59:40.097 --> 59:43.700
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it scales down the Doom textures and plays it again.

59:43.840 --> 59:45.181
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

59:45.221 --> 59:53.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll look in and see if I can make levels myself because it'd be pretty cool to actually put homaged, if not straight up ported, Doom worlds into Doom RL.

59:54.208 --> 59:58.091
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, considering that I just gave it number one, a lot more Rogue Legacy as well.

59:58.211 --> 59:59.673
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got another...

01:00:00.673 --> 01:00:01.954
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 levels or some odd like that.

01:00:02.034 --> 01:00:04.096
[SPEAKER_02]: Levels basically map to how many upgrades you got.

01:00:04.336 --> 01:00:07.058
[SPEAKER_02]: So a good heaping helping of hours in the last week.

01:00:08.398 --> 01:00:12.541
[SPEAKER_02]: After I watched you streaming Super Hexagon, I tried that out for myself again.

01:00:13.442 --> 01:00:14.743
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's strange.

01:00:14.823 --> 01:00:17.224
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it on iOS some time ago.

01:00:17.565 --> 01:00:19.686
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not terrible at it on iOS.

01:00:20.447 --> 01:00:21.427
[SPEAKER_02]: But on a D-pad, I...

01:00:22.848 --> 01:00:23.949
[SPEAKER_02]: Just abysmal.

01:00:24.409 --> 01:00:29.193
[SPEAKER_02]: My records are barely 20-30 seconds on any level and much less on the higher ones.

01:00:29.213 --> 01:00:30.694
[SPEAKER_04]: No, those are really good scores.

01:00:31.775 --> 01:00:32.576
[SPEAKER_02]: They really are.

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:36.960
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can beat 30 seconds relatively easy on iOS.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:41.663
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's because for what it's worth, the D-pads on Apple laptops are very small.

01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:52.072
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to play them with these micro touches doesn't work very well where on iOS I just have to jam my finger onto one of the sides of the iPhone or iPad or what have you.

01:00:53.593 --> 01:00:55.994
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, fun reminder.

01:00:56.674 --> 01:00:58.996
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I played that game on iOS some time ago and it was really fun.

01:00:59.136 --> 01:01:04.719
[SPEAKER_02]: But Super Hexagon, Rogue Legacy, Doom RL, probably something else that I don't even recall at the moment.

01:01:05.099 --> 01:01:06.640
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I talked about it last week.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.222
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely the continuing Rogue week.

01:01:10.602 --> 01:01:11.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Rogue-like week.

01:01:12.403 --> 01:01:14.584
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a great week to have as far as I'm concerned.

01:01:14.784 --> 01:01:15.425
[SPEAKER_04]: It absolutely is.

01:01:15.445 --> 01:01:16.345
[SPEAKER_04]: I love me some roguelikes.

01:01:16.425 --> 01:01:16.685
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:01:17.906 --> 01:01:19.087
[SPEAKER_12]: Real quick, I forgot.

01:01:19.707 --> 01:01:20.608
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to Golf Land.

01:01:21.889 --> 01:01:22.209
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no.

01:01:48.507 --> 01:01:50.429
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, why did they even add that?

01:01:50.469 --> 01:01:52.710
[SPEAKER_12]: It was completely annoying the entire time.

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:56.393
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, it's, it's, Golf Land's sad.

01:01:58.194 --> 01:02:07.721
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of the arcades we used to love are just, it's so hard to go into them and see just a sea of little kid gambling games, the ticket spitting games.

01:02:07.781 --> 01:02:08.962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so hard to see that.

01:02:09.603 --> 01:02:11.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get Josh addicted to those.

01:02:11.504 --> 01:02:12.385
Yeah.

01:02:13.536 --> 01:02:13.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah.

01:02:14.417 --> 01:02:14.758
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:02:15.879 --> 01:02:16.320
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:19.164
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we are going to get into some news, but first, some quick housekeeping.

01:02:19.905 --> 01:02:24.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR or you can also follow us on Facebook.

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:25.673
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:25.953 --> 01:02:26.974
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also on Google+.

01:02:27.094 --> 01:02:29.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:30.198 --> 01:02:37.841
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape live again Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at vognetwork.com and we will be back.

01:02:37.961 --> 01:02:43.743
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean we didn't end up having any time off for the holidays just because these Sundays fell on pretty good days this year.

01:02:44.463 --> 01:02:51.906
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will be back again next week still looking at the potential of doing a road show in a couple weeks which will be very exciting because we haven't done one of those in a very long time.

01:02:51.946 --> 01:02:52.726
[SPEAKER_09]: And I should be able to.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.648
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to be very exciting.

01:02:54.728 --> 01:03:06.199
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, Loki, it'll probably be right when the kid's here, but it'll work out for at least us to go hopefully hang with some of the old school friends at OLR and some of our friends in the Bay Area.

01:03:06.219 --> 01:03:07.380
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be a very different type of episode.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:07.760
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

01:03:08.721 --> 01:03:09.541
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, all right.

01:03:10.262 --> 01:03:12.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.

01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:12.683
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:12.703 --> 01:03:13.303
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason opened his present.

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:14.323
[SPEAKER_02]: I just unwrapped my present.

01:03:14.343 --> 01:03:14.844
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what'd you get?

01:03:15.664 --> 01:03:17.605
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of foil, which I am now wearing as a hat.

01:03:18.105 --> 01:03:18.385
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:19.085
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can.

01:03:19.346 --> 01:03:20.346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very pretty.

01:03:20.406 --> 01:03:22.287
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very blue, flowery, something.

01:03:22.487 --> 01:03:23.167
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to feel cool.

01:03:23.707 --> 01:03:27.309
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually want to go get some more to do decoupage with it just because it's so pretty.

01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:29.684
[SPEAKER_02]: ThinkGeekShirt

01:03:48.393 --> 01:03:49.674
[SPEAKER_04]: Make me a hat with this foil.

01:03:49.974 --> 01:03:50.274
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:51.614
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:03:51.635 --> 01:03:55.136
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, get that foil off my head because I can't see the news otherwise.

01:03:55.196 --> 01:03:56.217
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get to the news.

01:03:57.237 --> 01:03:58.157
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, start us off tonight.

01:03:58.978 --> 01:03:59.358
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

01:03:59.458 --> 01:04:04.240
[SPEAKER_12]: So usually when we report these types of stories, it's normally EA shutting down servers.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.041
[SPEAKER_12]: But this time around, it's actually going to be Sony.

01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:11.223
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to be shutting down their online servers for a few of the PlayStation 3 games that they have.

01:04:12.204 --> 01:04:16.126
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting off with, of course, Gran Turismo 5 is going to be –

01:04:17.239 --> 01:04:26.322
[SPEAKER_12]: having their servers turned off May 20th next year, and Resistance, the entire franchise, going down on March 28th.

01:04:26.803 --> 01:04:39.968
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, as of January 28th, they're going to be shutting down the online connectivity for MAG, SOCOM Special Forces, and SOCOM Confrontation, and SOCOM Confrontation and MAG.

01:04:40.308 --> 01:04:43.609
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are online-only games, so if you bought those, you're fucked.

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.662
[SPEAKER_02]: Your game is over.

01:04:47.543 --> 01:04:58.894
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of get the Gran Turismo 5 because they're trying to nudge people onto Gran Turismo 6, and I'm sure there's newer SOCOM games as well, but MAG, I kind of thought there was an audience still out there for that.

01:04:58.934 --> 01:05:05.280
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong, but I kind of thought MAG still had a little loyal following to it because it was really about massive groups of people, right?

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:05.520
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.301
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if they're not achieving that anymore.

01:05:07.981 --> 01:05:25.132
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly don't have these numbers to back them up either, and I know I was interested in the game, never actually went into picking it up, but a game like that, if its numbers are dwindling, if they're not able to matchmake and keep the 4A, the massive number melee going on, then why keep supporting the game?

01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:27.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Why keep putting the time and money into it?

01:05:28.834 --> 01:05:33.657
[SPEAKER_12]: I always think that you should have an offline component to at least do some sort of LAN or something, so

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:37.091
[SPEAKER_12]: You have something that's not just a coaster when this is done.

01:05:37.311 --> 01:05:37.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

01:05:38.871 --> 01:05:39.212
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:45.013
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking here in chat and Robert M says, I thought MAG had already shut down.

01:05:45.473 --> 01:05:47.974
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, they're shutting it down January 28th, 2014.

01:05:48.754 --> 01:05:55.216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that this was actually announced some time ago in July of 2013 that they were going to shut it down.

01:05:55.256 --> 01:06:00.258
[SPEAKER_04]: So the news that it is shutting down is not necessarily new, but it is coming within the next few weeks.

01:06:00.618 --> 01:06:00.798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:05.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft

01:06:21.733 --> 01:06:46.117
[SPEAKER_12]: but they'll shut down someday 11 is still active isn't it oh yeah there's no no time no expectation for that to go away no game like that'll be around forever you know at least like something like that that's a pc game there's a chance that someone may be able to like you know run a a third party server or something like that after the game is shut down whereas something like this that's on playstation 3 there's no chance for that at all you're just

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:47.411
[SPEAKER_12]: You're out of luck.

01:06:47.511 --> 01:06:53.956
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, and yeah, maybe you're not playing the game, but I still think that there should always be at least some sort of an offline component.

01:06:54.416 --> 01:06:56.778
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that aspect of it.

01:06:56.838 --> 01:07:02.823
[SPEAKER_02]: If not an offline component, then a self-hosted game, a self-hosted server that you can run for nostalgia's sake.

01:07:02.903 --> 01:07:03.424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:07:04.264 --> 01:07:06.726
[SPEAKER_04]: They did that when they shut down Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

01:07:07.387 --> 01:07:07.787
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't know.

01:07:08.187 --> 01:07:08.528
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.

01:07:08.908 --> 01:07:16.294
[SPEAKER_04]: They made it so that you could export your stuff and play on private servers, which is weird to see a company embrace that, but that was a really good thing, I think.

01:07:16.394 --> 01:07:17.135
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:07:38.274 --> 01:07:47.857
[SPEAKER_02]: For nostalgia's sake, being able to continue to play the game, revisiting old gaming memories, that would be a good thing for MMO makers to adopt and continue to do.

01:07:49.998 --> 01:08:03.362
[SPEAKER_12]: And considering, too, that eventually, I'm assuming, I don't know if they're going to carry on the SOCOM brand, so like PlayStation 4, but you might want to have some of that stuff still available to play so that, you know,

01:08:04.656 --> 01:08:08.319
[SPEAKER_12]: People might know what SOCOM is when the PlayStation 4 version comes around.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it is truly a franchise that they're going to sunset.

01:08:12.802 --> 01:08:13.563
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we don't know.

01:08:15.004 --> 01:08:15.744
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be happening.

01:08:16.945 --> 01:08:17.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:08:24.795 --> 01:08:28.176
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we shall move on with some more news.

01:08:28.496 --> 01:08:28.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason.

01:08:42.742 --> 01:09:00.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, not to jump on a presumption of Nintendo, but considering the age of their player base, having a productive game... Like, everybody is astonished when they find out that somebody building something in Minecraft is absurdly young.

01:09:00.372 --> 01:09:04.475
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're 7, they're 8, maybe even younger than that.

01:09:05.115 --> 01:09:10.919
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Wii gamepad gives you at least a little bit more flexibility than a standard controller would.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.262
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people that just stick their kids in front of a laptop or a desktop and let them go to work.

01:09:18.642 --> 01:09:28.287
[SPEAKER_02]: But for something like this that's a little bit more accessible, this comes as a huge surprise to me because kids that I know really seem to enjoy Minecraft.

01:09:28.347 --> 01:09:29.107
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to get...

01:09:30.968 --> 01:09:33.569
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura did just give out some foil, so we have that part up

01:09:55.061 --> 01:09:57.002
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not tinfoil, it's fake foil.

01:09:57.102 --> 01:10:00.723
[SPEAKER_04]: But it at least gets us halfway to these conspiracy theories.

01:10:01.443 --> 01:10:05.764
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but for real, like, you know, a map, duh, would be great on the Wii U gamepad.

01:10:06.304 --> 01:10:11.546
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just having your inventory screen and the crafting on the gamepad would make for a great experience.

01:10:11.826 --> 01:10:15.347
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the biggest pain in the ass of Minecraft is having to bring up the screen.

01:10:15.467 --> 01:10:16.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, where was I, man?

01:10:16.447 --> 01:10:20.568
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think, oh my gosh, it would make so much sense on the Wii U. So it is very disappointing.

01:10:20.959 --> 01:10:21.319
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

01:10:41.051 --> 01:10:41.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, who knows?

01:10:41.712 --> 01:10:42.452
[SPEAKER_04]: That's possible too.

01:10:43.293 --> 01:10:47.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't underestimate, though, guys, how huge Minecraft is with, like, kids.

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:48.658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always shocked.

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:49.219
[SPEAKER_09]: Julian plays.

01:10:49.859 --> 01:10:53.943
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always shocked at how many people I know with kids, and they're like, oh yeah, my kid plays Minecraft.

01:10:53.963 --> 01:10:56.025
[SPEAKER_04]: And it probably needs not be said.

01:10:56.205 --> 01:10:57.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only just the kids.

01:10:57.446 --> 01:10:58.606
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole freaking family!

01:10:58.746 --> 01:10:59.867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for real.

01:10:59.887 --> 01:11:03.448
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying, like, there are a ton of people that play Minecraft.

01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:07.430
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it is pretty astounding what that game's accomplished.

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:22.215
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a buddy of mine that runs a private server and has, you know, Bucket and all the mods, and there's an IRC room that we congregate in, and so he runs a plugin that bridges the conversation in Minecraft back to IRC two-way.

01:11:23.075 --> 01:11:25.616
[SPEAKER_02]: And this wouldn't exist on a console, of course.

01:11:26.276 --> 01:11:53.397
[SPEAKER_02]: um but the the expansiveness is what makes that game and the game is built around expansion or surviving if you're if you play survival of course or building stuff expansion like me yeah or digging holes i get rid of stuff too there is an immense amount of potential now and i think last week we talked about like the long tail of nintendo there will not be an immediate return on investment but it will happen because that game is popular that is

01:11:54.057 --> 01:12:21.392
[SPEAKER_04]: you know that that would that would be a huge title to make its way to Nintendo but current plans unfortunately ain't gonna happen for the foreseeable future you know I had to really resist picking up the PlayStation 3 version but it's like dude you own it on the 360 and you own it on the PC and how much did you really play it on the PC but I've had this real bug to play Minecraft lately so Loki we need to get that VOG server back even if even if I've got to front the money for it I think that we got to make it happen so we can do it you don't need to front the money for it I just haven't gotten around I'll I'll do it I'll

01:12:22.452 --> 01:12:23.073
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

01:12:23.153 --> 01:12:24.153
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm excited.

01:12:24.553 --> 01:12:26.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Christmas miracles happen again.

01:12:26.334 --> 01:12:36.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you bomb the server and start new and maybe as an easy mode monsters thing where there's some challenge or something against it, I think that would be great.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:45.644
[SPEAKER_12]: I backed up the server because they brought back the server for a few days and I was able to back it all up.

01:12:45.744 --> 01:12:49.106
[SPEAKER_12]: It's old now compared to the updates and everything.

01:12:49.446 --> 01:12:49.706
[SPEAKER_12]: Also,

01:12:50.516 --> 01:12:55.079
[SPEAKER_12]: Free Mode gets boring after a while because there's no real point, especially when there's not a lot of people playing at the same time.

01:12:55.099 --> 01:12:56.639
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why survival is kind of nice.

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:57.220
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.042
[SPEAKER_09]: See, my favorite thing was doing all the creative stuff was digging holes and exploring.

01:13:02.122 --> 01:13:03.783
[SPEAKER_09]: So I didn't really care about the other stuff.

01:13:04.844 --> 01:13:05.184
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:13:05.344 --> 01:13:07.806
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got some people in chat wanting to know when that's back up.

01:13:07.886 --> 01:13:08.706
[SPEAKER_04]: So look forward to that.

01:13:08.746 --> 01:13:09.527
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that'll be something for 2014.

01:13:10.747 --> 01:13:12.449
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but I do notice Robert M in chat says,

01:13:26.365 --> 01:13:39.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, though, I'm going to tell you what stopped me from getting it on the PlayStation 3 is that we haven't heard what's happening with PlayStation 4 and Vita versions yet, and I want to wait and hear that, because will my PlayStation 3... Is it going to be cross-play amongst all of them?

01:13:39.112 --> 01:13:42.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if so, fine, I'll invest the money in the PlayStation 3 version right now.

01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:47.637
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's not going to be cross-play and the PlayStation 4 is going to be different or whatever, then I'll probably just wait and get it on 4.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:50.699
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be different on 4, I guarantee it, because

01:13:51.104 --> 01:13:55.808
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why right now the PlayStation 3 version is basically a port of the Xbox 360 one.

01:13:55.928 --> 01:14:00.251
[SPEAKER_12]: So 4 and Xbox One are going to have larger maps and probably more features.

01:14:01.332 --> 01:14:01.912
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

01:14:02.232 --> 01:14:02.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on.

01:14:02.853 --> 01:14:04.194
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us in the news?

01:14:05.038 --> 01:14:05.818
[SPEAKER_09]: Mass Effect stuff.

01:14:08.121 --> 01:14:22.835
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as you guys know, on November 7th, which was N7 day, we had a few tweets go in that showed some of the screens, not like full-on screenshots, but you could see computers in the background with a little bit here and there for the development of

01:14:23.195 --> 01:14:23.696
[SPEAKER_09]: BioWare BioWare

01:14:40.491 --> 01:15:09.388
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're basically saying and the tweet basically says great time playing the next Mass Effect game in Montreal ambitious beautiful fresh but recognizable and fun so and I'm from what this is it looks like it's just in the very early stages of level testing and design what a fucking tease though I know I'm so excited and scared literally I am Jesse Spano I am Jesse Spano in that scene when it was the new Mass Effect game I'm so excited and so scared

01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:11.532
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be a Shepard story.

01:15:11.572 --> 01:15:13.797
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little scared, but I'm really excited to play.

01:15:14.779 --> 01:15:15.580
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it.

01:15:15.781 --> 01:15:18.587
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get that trailer at E3.

01:15:19.028 --> 01:15:20.010
[SPEAKER_04]: By six months from now...

01:15:20.635 --> 01:15:22.316
[SPEAKER_04]: We will know about this game, DarkSakura.

01:15:22.396 --> 01:15:23.057
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, we will.

01:15:23.077 --> 01:15:23.757
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

01:15:24.238 --> 01:15:29.602
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might make it for the holidays, although I kind of think spring 2015 is a little more realistic, but you never know.

01:15:30.002 --> 01:15:30.683
[SPEAKER_04]: If they can play it now.

01:15:30.703 --> 01:15:31.523
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still going to play it.

01:15:31.643 --> 01:15:32.224
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

01:15:32.384 --> 01:15:39.669
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I was very irritated with how more human-centric the last game went.

01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:47.656
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see more expansion into the other species in the Mass Effect universe, but I'll wait and see what happens.

01:15:47.696 --> 01:15:52.700
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to reserve my judgment until I've actually got it in front of me playing it.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:53.981
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I feel.

01:15:57.213 --> 01:15:59.093
[SPEAKER_09]: That and it better have the same good multiplayer.

01:15:59.513 --> 01:15:59.854
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:15:59.874 --> 01:16:01.514
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that was pretty freaking awesome.

01:16:01.534 --> 01:16:02.094
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know what's funny?

01:16:02.114 --> 01:16:09.715
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about server shutdowns earlier in the show, and I'm kind of surprised they haven't threatened to pull the plug on Mass Effect 3 yet, but I'm sure there's still a lot of people that play online.

01:16:10.156 --> 01:16:10.716
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, heck yeah.

01:16:10.856 --> 01:16:15.377
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I don't know about, like, Wii U, but who knows?

01:16:15.697 --> 01:16:15.977
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:16:16.237 --> 01:16:21.438
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so borked on Wii U just with the whole Genesis thing, and you didn't get all of your options.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:22.258
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:16:23.299 --> 01:16:29.165
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, if you're going to get it on any system, get it on the Xbox because you can totally mod your files.

01:16:30.266 --> 01:16:31.087
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have to get a console.

01:16:31.507 --> 01:16:32.348
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have to get a console.

01:16:33.109 --> 01:16:35.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:16:35.972 --> 01:16:40.836
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I have a feeling there's not going to be much, but it's a part of the show we always do.

01:16:40.997 --> 01:16:44.500
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, how's the US look for release dates?

01:16:44.921 --> 01:16:45.241
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:48.635
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a damn thing coming out this week.

01:16:48.975 --> 01:16:52.196
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, let's travel to Japan and take a look and see if anything's coming out there.

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:53.536
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of don't think so.

01:16:54.496 --> 01:16:56.697
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little slow in bringing it up here, so sorry, guys.

01:16:56.857 --> 01:16:59.257
[SPEAKER_04]: They still do not have PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, remember.

01:16:59.297 --> 01:17:00.058
[SPEAKER_04]: That is coming out later.

01:17:01.138 --> 01:17:09.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Mafia 2 gets a price reduction, and there's some third-party game pads on the PlayStation 3 on December 31st.

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:11.001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something, right?

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:11.781
[SPEAKER_04]: How about on the Xbox 360?

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:14.422
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing on the Xbox 360.

01:17:14.822 --> 01:17:15.822
[SPEAKER_04]: What about on the handhelds?

01:17:15.842 --> 01:17:17.343
[SPEAKER_04]: How about on the Vita or the 3DS?

01:17:18.223 --> 01:17:18.884
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing on the Vita.

01:17:21.945 --> 01:17:26.227
[SPEAKER_04]: 3DS gets Puzzle & Dragons Z. Oh, never mind.

01:17:26.287 --> 01:17:30.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are just decorative things.

01:17:30.389 --> 01:17:32.590
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Puzzle & Dragons really big on 3DS over there?

01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:33.310
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird.

01:17:35.592 --> 01:17:35.912
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

01:17:57.538 --> 01:17:58.359
[SPEAKER_09]: Jack and shit.

01:17:58.579 --> 01:17:59.800
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured for the UK.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:00.300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:00.640
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

01:18:01.301 --> 01:18:01.661
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:18:01.741 --> 01:18:02.322
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

01:18:02.522 --> 01:18:02.762
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

01:18:02.982 --> 01:18:03.442
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck all.

01:18:04.223 --> 01:18:05.124
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck all's coming out.

01:18:05.804 --> 01:18:08.686
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got enough games to play right now is the moral of this story.

01:18:08.766 --> 01:18:09.307
[SPEAKER_04]: Steam.

01:18:09.947 --> 01:18:10.587
[SPEAKER_04]: Release dates.

01:18:10.848 --> 01:18:11.989
[SPEAKER_04]: Apps are freaking literally nothing.

01:18:12.049 --> 01:18:12.369
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:18:12.489 --> 01:18:15.011
[SPEAKER_04]: Couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:15.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

01:18:16.772 --> 01:18:17.292
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

01:18:17.813 --> 01:18:23.637
[SPEAKER_12]: So unfortunately, one of the games I was actually looking forward to next year

01:18:24.965 --> 01:18:53.068
[SPEAKER_12]: No Man's Sky The developer, Hello Games, suffered some flood damage over the week and it took out some of their servers and PCs and stuff like that monitors, furniture a bunch of other stuff I'm not sure if that necessarily obviously that might affect some of the development of the game but they haven't really said that anything's been delayed yet I'm sure they have all that stuff backed up anyways

01:18:53.667 --> 01:19:22.534
[SPEAKER_12]: and then also they're saying they're not really insured for the flood damage but hopefully they may get some sort of help from Microsoft I guess they're saying Phil Spencer said he might be able to look into helping them out but I don't know they'll see maybe they'll do some funding stuff to recover some of the things that they had that need to be replaced or it kind of sucks that they didn't have flood insurance I'm not really sure in the area that they're at if it's

01:19:22.987 --> 01:19:25.349
[SPEAKER_12]: Prone to flooding or if this is just some freak thing.

01:19:25.689 --> 01:19:26.950
[SPEAKER_12]: That sucks either way.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:35.397
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's really unfortunate, but these Mother Nature events, or as they call them, acts of God or whatever, these things are going to happen.

01:19:35.477 --> 01:19:48.667
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a solemn reminder to have an emergency plan no matter who you are, what you do, what are you going to do if there's a fire or there's an earthquake or a tornado or whatever it is where you live.

01:19:49.167 --> 01:19:50.909
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's put your offices on the second floor.

01:19:51.469 --> 01:19:52.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right, right.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:54.190
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.271
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good luck to them, though.

01:19:56.571 --> 01:20:07.514
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they're able to make a recovery because that No Man's Sky did look very interesting, even though for some reason it's the one game they didn't show on TV, which was kind of shitty, but it was a good trailer.

01:20:08.355 --> 01:20:08.515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:20:08.795 --> 01:20:09.095
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:20:10.118 --> 01:20:12.079
[SPEAKER_09]: Ragingator says that games are like Pokemans.

01:20:12.099 --> 01:20:12.900
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta get them all.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:13.620
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you don't.

01:20:14.501 --> 01:20:15.801
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get them all.

01:20:15.861 --> 01:20:16.482
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't.

01:20:16.962 --> 01:20:21.845
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, but you really don't need to because there are games that stink on ice.

01:20:22.557 --> 01:20:24.398
[SPEAKER_04]: All the networks online were getting hammered.

01:20:43.504 --> 01:20:45.866
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation Network shut down for an amount of time.

01:20:46.247 --> 01:20:47.328
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live was down.

01:20:47.368 --> 01:20:50.230
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was down quite as long as the others, but it was down for a little bit.

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:52.092
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo got hammered as well.

01:20:52.612 --> 01:21:06.385
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo, you know, very apologetic via their Facebook page saying the problem, the reason why Nintendo Network went down is because the influx of Nintendo Network accounts being created and trying to get onto the eShop platform.

01:21:06.585 --> 01:21:16.412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, when you sell a 3DS with an eShop copy of a game that a lot of people want to play, I mean... Translation, because of y'all greedy bitches.

01:21:16.973 --> 01:21:27.220
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think it's necessarily that they're greedy, but it's just here we go again with poor planning, especially when it comes to network stuff, and it's a bad trend for games.

01:21:27.241 --> 01:21:31.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of some of the worst games of the year, calling out SimCity.

01:21:32.144 --> 01:21:35.747
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I personally am not calling it out because I'm going to be honest, I didn't play it.

01:21:36.087 --> 01:21:36.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:21:52.882 --> 01:22:08.566
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, maybe a little bit apples to oranges is what I'm saying there, because obviously a 3DS does not require you to be online, but Nintendo certainly took strides with their latest patch, and by only bundling in the eShop version of some of these games on some of their consoles, you know, they were kind of asking for it on Christmas Day.

01:22:08.666 --> 01:22:14.168
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you kind of look at something like this and you go, Nintendo, y'all got no one to blame but yourselves.

01:22:15.048 --> 01:22:16.289
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and your poor planning.

01:22:16.869 --> 01:22:21.270
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I'm curious to actually how many consoles they sold, because you know, it...

01:22:22.332 --> 01:22:30.362
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't sell that many and they couldn't handle the influx of a couple thousand people, then I'd be a little curious.

01:22:30.462 --> 01:22:32.025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's not just the Wii U, Loki.

01:22:32.065 --> 01:22:33.026
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 3DS.

01:22:33.787 --> 01:22:36.791
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that, but come on.

01:22:37.331 --> 01:22:38.833
[SPEAKER_12]: They know how many consoles they're putting out.

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:39.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

01:22:40.137 --> 01:22:47.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyhow, the Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DS was taken down, and last we heard it was supposed to be back up 4 a.m.

01:22:47.359 --> 01:22:47.759
[SPEAKER_04]: today.

01:22:47.959 --> 01:22:49.820
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't checked to see if it was back up.

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.000
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:54.861
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen Miiverse has been pretty active and so forth, so I think things are running again over there.

01:22:55.561 --> 01:22:58.602
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that was not so great.

01:22:59.682 --> 01:23:05.284
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, kind of as a snowball effect, the Pokemon Bank was supposed to come out on December 27th.

01:23:06.704 --> 01:23:14.206
[SPEAKER_04]: It was out and then it got pulled with no Western launch yet announced because this was supposed to come out here as well.

01:23:14.746 --> 01:23:20.068
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Pokemon Bank was the new system where you were going to be able to take Pokemon from X and Y and put them in the cloud.

01:23:20.448 --> 01:23:23.869
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how you were going to be able to transfer Pokemon to future games.

01:23:24.409 --> 01:23:29.811
[SPEAKER_04]: And no matter what system Nintendo has Pokemon out on next, you'd be able to transfer things through the cloud.

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:35.315
[SPEAKER_04]: So because of the network difficulties, they pulled the game because they wanted people to stop trying to get the game.

01:23:35.635 --> 01:23:36.856
[SPEAKER_04]: It's causing too much bandwidth.

01:23:37.316 --> 01:23:41.920
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, you should have known when you put all this shit out at once, something like this would happen.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.081
[SPEAKER_04]: So shame, shame.

01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.403
[SPEAKER_04]: But for better or worse, they did delay this a little bit.

01:23:46.783 --> 01:23:47.804
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Pokemon in the cloud?

01:23:48.505 --> 01:23:49.345
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo used Fly.

01:23:49.605 --> 01:23:50.366
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't very effective.

01:23:52.336 --> 01:23:54.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Womp womp.

01:23:54.898 --> 01:23:55.238
Fired!

01:23:55.698 --> 01:24:08.365
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, if you want to try Pokemon Bank, you're supposed to be able to download until January 31st, 2014 and be able to download a 30-day trial and then it will be $5 a year.

01:24:09.346 --> 01:24:13.888
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you access the bank before September 30th of 2014, you'll get Celebi for free.

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:18.651
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go, 3,000 Pokemon can go in the bank and it will... Did you say celibacy?

01:24:19.111 --> 01:24:19.772
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Celebi.

01:24:20.632 --> 01:24:31.521
[SPEAKER_04]: It will work with Pokemon Black, White, Black 2, White 2 through the PokeTransporter and X and Y. So that's how you can get those generations in there as well and then whatever happens next.

01:24:32.722 --> 01:24:33.242
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

01:24:33.282 --> 01:24:38.426
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, we don't know when that will come out, but I'm assuming probably in the first week of January is when they're going to push that back.

01:24:38.466 --> 01:24:41.809
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will probably have a very quiet launch because they don't want everybody to hit it at once.

01:24:42.669 --> 01:24:45.772
[SPEAKER_04]: But once it hits the internet, open the floodgates!

01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:50.592
[SPEAKER_04]: FifthDream in chat saying, the Pokemons are clogging up our clouds.

01:24:50.673 --> 01:24:52.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that is kind of what happened.

01:24:53.515 --> 01:24:57.759
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like in WALL-E when the ship was trying to escape and it just blew through all of the satellites.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:24:59.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:06.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane where, you know what, you didn't have games in the cloud.

01:25:08.385 --> 01:25:10.426
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:25:10.506 --> 01:25:12.407
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually picked something a little on the obscure side.

01:25:12.447 --> 01:25:13.407
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked Ordine.

01:25:34.818 --> 01:25:35.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Ordyne it is!

01:25:57.670 --> 01:26:25.448
[SPEAKER_09]: and you have characters named Yuichiro Tomari who is a scientist and the main protagonist and you get a red ship and then you get Sunday Chin who is a Chinese assistant and the pilot of the green ship you get Kana Aihara who is Tomari's fiance you get Dr. Kubota who is the main antagonist you get Miki-chan who is a shopkeeper and Dream Company Limited who is a robot who flies around and helps you

01:26:25.988 --> 01:26:28.250
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, it's just a really cute little shooter.

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:30.191
[SPEAKER_09]: You get all the usual power-ups, you know.

01:26:32.332 --> 01:26:35.554
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thing about this is that it came out in 1988.

01:26:37.516 --> 01:26:41.218
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's one of those Namco System 2 hardware games.

01:26:41.939 --> 01:26:44.680
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came out on PC Engine in 1989.

01:26:45.061 --> 01:26:47.542
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came out for the TurboGrafx in 1990.

01:26:47.662 --> 01:26:51.045
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the Namco Museum Volume 4.

01:26:51.385 --> 01:26:53.967
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has come out on the North American Virtual Console.

01:26:54.967 --> 01:27:00.233
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just a cute little game.

01:27:00.413 --> 01:27:04.337
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually advertised as a comical shooter.

01:27:05.018 --> 01:27:07.781
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta be honest, it looks a lot like Fantasy Zone.

01:27:08.041 --> 01:27:09.563
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot, a lot like Fantasy Zone.

01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:10.183
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does.

01:27:10.204 --> 01:27:12.266
[SPEAKER_04]: It has that same cartoony, cutesy style.

01:27:12.586 --> 01:27:14.228
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

01:27:14.801 --> 01:27:17.823
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the one thing about this, though, is that... It's like a little shop.

01:27:17.843 --> 01:27:19.984
[SPEAKER_04]: See, he just flew in the shop, like you do in fantasy mode.

01:27:20.144 --> 01:27:21.285
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, exactly.

01:27:22.386 --> 01:27:29.430
[SPEAKER_09]: With this particular one, you basically, like, for example, Miyuki's channel will stop by, like you were just saying.

01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:36.614
[SPEAKER_09]: When Dream Company passes by, you can win crystals to buy weapons.

01:27:37.695 --> 01:27:42.638
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have one-hit kills, but you can buy your extra lives as you go through the game.

01:27:43.158 --> 01:27:44.599
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a cutesy little game.

01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:45.700
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was fun.

01:27:46.141 --> 01:27:48.022
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole bunch extra special to it.

01:27:48.103 --> 01:27:51.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they do like a little celebration dance when they clear the round.

01:27:51.526 --> 01:27:57.791
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do believe that this is the one that Albatross was from in Namco High.

01:27:58.772 --> 01:28:05.858
[SPEAKER_09]: So whenever you guys see Albatross or Al-B-Tross, as he is also known in that, this is the game he's from.

01:28:06.679 --> 01:28:08.280
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to double check it just to make sure.

01:28:08.841 --> 01:28:10.042
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm pretty sure that is it.

01:28:11.949 --> 01:28:12.750
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's your classic game.

01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:13.250
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this?

01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:15.451
[SPEAKER_04]: Some type of like roulette game that's in there too?

01:28:15.611 --> 01:28:16.612
[SPEAKER_04]: Like little gambling games?

01:28:16.972 --> 01:28:18.673
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's when you run into the robot.

01:28:19.114 --> 01:28:19.434
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

01:28:20.694 --> 01:28:21.055
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty cool.

01:28:21.075 --> 01:28:21.375
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:22.356
[SPEAKER_09]: Just double checking.

01:28:22.376 --> 01:28:28.539
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit, I had never played this game before, but I kind of want to, I wish it was on one of the newer retro game collections so I could check it out.

01:28:28.559 --> 01:28:28.920
[SPEAKER_04]: But there it is.

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:34.303
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week, boys and girls, Ordine, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:35.444 --> 01:28:36.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Good pick, DarkSakura.

01:28:36.264 --> 01:28:37.445
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it when you pick things I haven't heard of.

01:28:37.907 --> 01:28:44.133
[SPEAKER_09]: And also just to say, you know, again, if you haven't played Namco High, it's really fucking fun.

01:28:45.133 --> 01:28:47.456
[SPEAKER_09]: And it'll work on your phone because it is HTML5.

01:28:48.136 --> 01:28:48.496
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:28:49.697 --> 01:28:53.221
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm double checking on the students one more time just so I can be sure.

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:55.603
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not loading up.

01:28:55.703 --> 01:28:57.064
[SPEAKER_09]: So sorry.

01:28:57.504 --> 01:28:59.226
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll probably be able to tell you guys soon.

01:29:00.859 --> 01:29:01.159
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:29:01.199 --> 01:29:05.703
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe she can tell us after the break because it is that time to take a break here at Orange Launch Radio.

01:29:05.723 --> 01:29:08.465
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got plenty more show when we come back.

01:29:09.246 --> 01:29:09.626
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wrong.

01:29:09.666 --> 01:29:10.707
[SPEAKER_09]: Albatross is from Rolling Thunder.

01:29:10.727 --> 01:29:11.568
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what I was thinking.

01:29:11.908 --> 01:29:12.148
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:16.392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's not as much news tonight, so we're flying through that a little quickly.

01:29:16.452 --> 01:29:17.993
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do still have the mailbag.

01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:19.995

[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_04]: We are live with our last episode of 2013 for this Sunday, December 29th, and it is episode number 533 of our show, already in progress.

01:30:28.492 --> 01:30:36.736
[SPEAKER_04]: Do remember, since those of you that listen on the podcast, there's a passphrase hidden somewhere in the show that you can punch into the website at vognetwork.com.

01:30:37.176 --> 01:30:39.758
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want, you can use those points to enter the raffle.

01:30:40.058 --> 01:30:41.478
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't have much time left.

01:30:41.518 --> 01:30:43.919
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, if it's after January 1st, you already missed out for the month.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:53.344
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're giving away a $20 gift card to many popular gaming services such as Nintendo Network and Xbox Live and so forth.

01:30:53.824 --> 01:30:54.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Also YouTube.

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:30.952
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Jason, you've been working very hard on this YouTube, so I gotta say, and thank you for reminding me, we just put up last week, we just put, because YouTube is, again, YouTube runs one week behind, six days-ish, one week behind, just because we prefer to have folks listen via the places that really give us ratings, instead of giving Google ratings, giving us ratings.

01:31:31.332 --> 01:31:35.993
[SPEAKER_04]: First, but then we like having it on YouTube for discovery purposes.

01:31:36.313 --> 01:31:42.254
[SPEAKER_04]: And starting with last week's episode, Jason, I don't know if you really plan on taking that level of effort every week, but I was very impressed.

01:31:43.255 --> 01:31:49.936
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of made it more of like an archive where you actually bookmarked all the sections of the show and very easy to find a part of the show you're looking for.

01:31:50.676 --> 01:31:52.677
[SPEAKER_04]: Some video synced up and things.

01:31:52.997 --> 01:31:54.977
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the video is always going to sync up.

01:31:55.037 --> 01:31:56.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I just completely screwed something up.

01:31:56.838 --> 01:31:57.118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:31:58.058 --> 01:31:59.379
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:32:19.389 --> 01:32:20.810
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, we're trying something new.

01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:22.031
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't know what it is yet.

01:32:22.291 --> 01:32:23.472
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll surprise you a little later.

01:32:23.712 --> 01:32:25.694
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what it is, but we're doing something new tonight.

01:32:26.634 --> 01:32:29.076
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just how you always kind of think, like, how can I do that?

01:32:29.096 --> 01:32:30.957
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I take this one step?

01:32:31.998 --> 01:32:37.342
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've said previously as well, I've also never done video work before, and it's always been an incredible interest to me.

01:32:38.103 --> 01:32:54.459
[SPEAKER_02]: and so this is this is one part learning design this is one part doing video editing this is one part being able to do a lot of post-production yeah I'm I'm contributing ways that are very fun for me and I plan to continue doing so and doing better each time

01:32:54.659 --> 01:32:55.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, do what you love.

01:32:55.519 --> 01:32:56.340
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I do this.

01:33:15.525 --> 01:33:23.807
[SPEAKER_04]: was that it was recognized some of the stuff I do outside of work and that I work with audio and video and that type of production and things kind of outside of work.

01:33:23.907 --> 01:33:27.148
[SPEAKER_04]: And that all plays into now, you know, what I do in my day job.

01:33:27.228 --> 01:33:33.230
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, you know, all these years later, OLR is actually like help me get a job in a way.

01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:35.990
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird, but I'm so thankful for it.

01:33:36.071 --> 01:33:38.131
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you guys for supporting it.

01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:38.991
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

01:33:42.182 --> 01:33:42.983
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a job too.

01:33:43.203 --> 01:33:43.803
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

01:33:43.864 --> 01:33:44.744
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a job as well.

01:33:44.764 --> 01:33:45.985
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say where I'm working.

01:33:46.086 --> 01:33:46.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:48.227
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you actually know me in person.

01:33:49.188 --> 01:33:53.672
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because given the nature of the job, I don't really want to.

01:33:53.772 --> 01:33:55.074
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely understand.

01:33:55.874 --> 01:33:57.476
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will be doing some tech support.

01:33:58.396 --> 01:33:59.057
[SPEAKER_09]: and that will be fun.

01:34:01.978 --> 01:34:06.260
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the thing that floored me is that I just happened to put it on my Facebook like I normally do.

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.381
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so happy I got the job.

01:34:08.621 --> 01:34:09.162
[SPEAKER_09]: 120 people.

01:34:10.202 --> 01:34:11.743
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, how do I know that many people?

01:34:12.423 --> 01:34:17.646
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank everyone who supported me in my attempts to find gainful employment.

01:34:18.767 --> 01:34:40.190
[SPEAKER_09]: um thank you people who were just being happy for me because you know that means a lot to me too you know just a lot of uh selfless people I want to thank so thank you and um also listening to uh the break music makes me really want to watch Swing Girls again because

01:34:40.410 --> 01:34:43.291
[SPEAKER_09]: Mexican Flyer is one of the songs they do for the finale.

01:34:43.451 --> 01:34:47.932
[SPEAKER_04]: We played some Space Channel 5 music here live, which I can't repeat on the podcast.

01:34:48.272 --> 01:34:50.073
[SPEAKER_04]: We would especially not own that on YouTube.

01:34:50.113 --> 01:34:52.233
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd get a copyright shutdown thing.

01:34:52.253 --> 01:34:54.554
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I don't know if Mexican Flyer is back in the public domain.

01:34:54.574 --> 01:34:57.615
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sega version definitely isn't.

01:34:57.635 --> 01:35:04.097
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, but it is big band swing music, which really brought that genre into the fore.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.283
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says that we're happy because you're happy.

01:35:08.463 --> 01:35:09.124
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:35:09.184 --> 01:35:15.714
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to give an arm of support to our buddy Brad over at PodCulture because he's job hunting right now and he's looking for something.

01:35:15.734 --> 01:35:19.820
[SPEAKER_09]: It took me three years so I hope it doesn't take you that long.

01:35:20.943 --> 01:35:24.146
[SPEAKER_04]: We are keeping our fingers and toesies crossed for our friend Brad.

01:35:25.247 --> 01:35:33.935
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need a really smart guy who produces a solid podcast about sci-fi and geek culture and a little bit of games and a little bit of everything, hire Brad.

01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:35.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

01:35:35.302 --> 01:35:39.205
[SPEAKER_09]: I downloaded it, I haven't watched it yet, but someone spoiled the regeneration for me.

01:35:57.148 --> 01:35:57.629
[SPEAKER_09]: David Tennant

01:36:15.552 --> 01:36:16.112
[SPEAKER_04]: I have that box set.

01:36:16.272 --> 01:36:17.673
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get that back for my friend.

01:36:39.898 --> 01:37:06.939
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't watch hardly any TV when I finished Orange is the New Black that was a miracle that I actually had the attention span to watch 13 hours worth of TV at any rate since I mentioned it if nobody out there has seen Swing Girls you can find it it's inexpensive now great little movie and yes it has subtitles but I just have to say if you like the music in Space Channel 5 get into Big Band there you go Loki you still there with us?

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:09.801
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, he took a break.

01:37:09.841 --> 01:37:10.581
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, he's there, hey!

01:37:12.263 --> 01:37:20.649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird when I can't see you, but Loki Baby Watch is on, which is why Loki is on Skype with us for a few weeks here, but Loki, any plans for the new year?

01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:24.652
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, no, not really.

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:32.158
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since Josh dressed up like a firework for Halloween, is he excited about New Year's Eve, or do you guys try not to get him too worked up about that?

01:37:33.711 --> 01:37:35.093
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't stay up for any of that stuff.

01:37:35.394 --> 01:37:36.215
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't know what's going on.

01:37:36.256 --> 01:37:39.702
[SPEAKER_12]: He has trouble figuring out what day it is during the day.

01:37:42.728 --> 01:37:45.694
[SPEAKER_12]: He thinks when he goes down for a nap or something like that, that's another day.

01:37:46.112 --> 01:37:54.076
[SPEAKER_04]: and so he doesn't understand time right now.

01:37:54.136 --> 01:37:55.677
[SPEAKER_04]: You and the jokes need to stop.

01:37:56.697 --> 01:37:57.798
[SPEAKER_04]: I never will.

01:37:58.678 --> 01:37:59.219
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

01:38:00.119 --> 01:38:03.060
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the intern Drew position here.

01:38:03.781 --> 01:38:06.382
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

01:38:07.523 --> 01:38:14.246
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so next month they've got some pretty decent stuff on PlayStation Plus and I'm

01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:16.291
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of excited about this.

01:38:16.631 --> 01:38:20.912
[SPEAKER_12]: In case you haven't played it yet, Bioshock Infinite is going to be one of the titles I've given away free.

01:38:21.372 --> 01:38:35.758
[SPEAKER_12]: Devil May Cry, also Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, and they're going to have some stuff for the Vita as well, Smartass and Worms Battle Islands, and Don't Starve will be available for PlayStation 4.

01:38:36.798 --> 01:38:38.959
[SPEAKER_12]: So, not bad.

01:38:38.999 --> 01:38:44.101
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really curious to see Microsoft step it up for the Xbox, you know,

01:38:44.892 --> 01:38:45.913
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

01:39:11.885 --> 01:39:32.604
[SPEAKER_02]: is fantastic there was the suggestions going around that even if you don't have a PS4 yet if you pick up well there's no free plus titles for 4 not retail but if you are a plus subscriber even if you don't have this system you can still buy it online and re-download it in the future which is

01:39:33.365 --> 01:39:35.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty damn fantastic.

01:39:35.706 --> 01:39:41.329
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been doing that even though I've been away from my PlayStation 3 for two, three months.

01:39:44.150 --> 01:39:44.370
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:50.312
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm looking forward to it and definitely recommend anyone that hasn't played Bioshock Infinite, definitely give it a try.

01:39:50.393 --> 01:39:53.594
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have PlayStation Plus, it's worth it.

01:39:55.415 --> 01:39:57.616
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the first round of...

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:27.795
[SPEAKER_12]: Grand Theft Auto online jobs these are created with the new deathmatch and race online creation tools that they released I think literally a week or so ago and so these are now Rockstar verified jobs they have basically picked six races and four deathmatches that now be kind of appearing everywhere online like the official Rockstar matches and so that's kind of cool and they actually do have a system in there

01:40:28.343 --> 01:40:32.347
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it didn't bleed through, but tell me if I'm crazy, you two here in studio just heard that siren, didn't you?

01:40:51.929 --> 01:40:53.050
[SPEAKER_02]: The siren?

01:40:53.751 --> 01:40:58.076
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an emergency siren that just went hauling in three... Oh, in this neighborhood?

01:40:58.116 --> 01:40:58.657
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't doubt it.

01:40:59.538 --> 01:41:00.339
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just well-timed.

01:41:02.261 --> 01:41:04.564
[SPEAKER_04]: A Grand Theft Auto story and the police are here?

01:41:04.704 --> 01:41:05.004
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:41:06.241 --> 01:41:06.781
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

01:41:07.402 --> 01:41:07.662
[SPEAKER_04]: Works.

01:41:08.343 --> 01:41:08.643
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:41:09.323 --> 01:41:11.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got a couple stories for you guys.

01:41:11.325 --> 01:41:12.486
[SPEAKER_04]: Another story about Doom.

01:41:12.546 --> 01:41:13.226
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with this?

01:41:13.326 --> 01:41:16.248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we're at Blast from the Past tonight with all this Doom story.

01:41:16.609 --> 01:41:19.931
[SPEAKER_04]: But VXJasonXV, tell me if you've heard about this one.

01:41:20.672 --> 01:41:29.538
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a mod for Doom that puts Resident Evil 4's Mercenaries mode within Doom.

01:41:29.938 --> 01:41:30.399
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

01:41:30.919 --> 01:41:34.081
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's actually a little video of this here that I'll play.

01:41:34.501 --> 01:41:35.061
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jason.

01:41:36.462 --> 01:41:38.603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very loud.

01:41:38.943 --> 01:41:43.705
[SPEAKER_04]: But you see them going through the menu here, and it's got the Resident Evil 4 stuff in there.

01:41:43.725 --> 01:41:44.986
[SPEAKER_08]: Leon S. Kennedy.

01:41:45.326 --> 01:41:47.567
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like you can play as different characters there, and Leon's one of them.

01:41:51.723 --> 01:41:59.128
[SPEAKER_02]: and for the chatters and podcast listeners, you can go to youtube.com slash orange lounge radio and view the video that we were watching just now.

01:41:59.148 --> 01:42:01.670
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the best radio, but the video will exist in a week.

01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:08.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, so you can have this, you do need a copy of Doom and you have to have its multiplayer mods in order to run this mod.

01:42:08.854 --> 01:42:10.555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only about 85% complete now.

01:42:10.575 --> 01:42:12.657
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now we're finally getting into some gameplay there.

01:42:12.717 --> 01:42:15.979
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh, that's a very recognizable Doom.

01:42:16.059 --> 01:42:19.101
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like they took Doom and made it like over the shoulder.

01:42:20.261 --> 01:42:20.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

01:42:20.721 --> 01:42:21.782
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he did the neck breaker!

01:42:22.082 --> 01:42:23.863
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very Resident Evil 4 style.

01:42:24.203 --> 01:42:25.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah!

01:42:25.304 --> 01:42:28.405
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the little, like, pop-ups that come up at the bottom there.

01:42:29.305 --> 01:42:30.066
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

01:42:30.726 --> 01:42:31.226
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

01:42:32.227 --> 01:42:36.769
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, he needs the multiplayer mods, and that's very awesome.

01:42:37.829 --> 01:42:38.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can you check that out?

01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:39.450
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to...

01:42:40.996 --> 01:42:41.836
[SPEAKER_02]: It's linked in this article.

01:42:42.016 --> 01:42:44.417
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:42:44.837 --> 01:42:47.778
[SPEAKER_02]: That's almost as cool as... VigLink.com.

01:42:47.838 --> 01:42:48.819
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like buried.

01:42:48.999 --> 01:42:51.560
[SPEAKER_09]: That is almost as cool as ASCII Quake.

01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:55.761
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually just goes to Mediafire, so it's literally just like a no-name dump right now.

01:42:55.801 --> 01:42:57.242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, somebody's hosting site there.

01:42:57.262 --> 01:43:01.303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just Google Domero, D-O-O-M, Doom Arrow.

01:43:02.003 --> 01:43:05.025
[SPEAKER_04]: D-O-O-M-E-R-O, and you can find his Ember Series mod.

01:43:05.185 --> 01:43:05.985
[SPEAKER_09]: That one's pretty cool.

01:43:06.065 --> 01:43:09.086
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, my favorite Doom mod to this day is still Gatchaman Doom.

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:10.980
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:43:11.781 --> 01:43:12.642
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, check that out.

01:43:13.663 --> 01:43:13.964
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:43:14.805 --> 01:43:16.346
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a quick story here.

01:43:16.727 --> 01:43:18.128
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy X-3.

01:43:18.368 --> 01:43:19.329
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:43:19.670 --> 01:43:20.070
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

01:43:20.170 --> 01:43:22.953
[SPEAKER_04]: X, not X, not X-2, but X-3.

01:43:23.414 --> 01:43:23.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

01:43:23.934 --> 01:43:24.415
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit down.

01:43:24.795 --> 01:43:25.556
[SPEAKER_04]: Put your pants on.

01:43:25.836 --> 01:43:26.817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not confirmed.

01:43:27.458 --> 01:43:28.299
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that...

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:32.543
[SPEAKER_04]: Kazushige Nojima Kazushige Nojima Kazushige Nojima

01:43:51.919 --> 01:43:56.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I would personally like to see a sequel like X3.

01:43:57.023 --> 01:44:03.468
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, we're gonna get a XIII with Lightning Returns, so it's... They just need to shut up and give us another VII or something.

01:44:03.488 --> 01:44:05.050
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say the same thing.

01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:07.131
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my damn VII?

01:44:07.732 --> 01:44:11.355
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a full immersive remake of VI.

01:44:12.406 --> 01:44:17.696
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, if you want to show your support, March 18th is the big day when these games come out in North America.

01:44:17.777 --> 01:44:21.344
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in Europe, you've got to wait just a couple more days, March 21st.

01:44:21.544 --> 01:44:22.346
[SPEAKER_04]: So, check those out.

01:44:23.548 --> 01:44:24.510
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:44:25.842 --> 01:44:27.783
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was just saying that my villager wants to kill Ed.

01:44:27.863 --> 01:44:29.724
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a message in chat from... Who doesn't?

01:44:32.045 --> 01:44:37.367
[SPEAKER_09]: They're talking about modding all the Doom stuff and then Tech2030 says, seriously, Animal Crossing mod where the villager shoots everything?

01:44:37.867 --> 01:44:41.649
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, my villager wants to kill Ed because he won't leave my damn village.

01:44:41.749 --> 01:44:42.289
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate Ed.

01:44:42.449 --> 01:44:44.310
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've consistently hit him with bug nets.

01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:45.810
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm just ignoring him.

01:44:46.391 --> 01:44:49.232
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had him almost fully ignored and then accidentally talked to him.

01:44:49.352 --> 01:44:50.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been writing him hateful notes?

01:44:50.853 --> 01:44:51.353
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't.

01:44:51.853 --> 01:44:53.694
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want him to leave, you have to ignore him.

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:54.134
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

01:44:55.171 --> 01:44:58.573
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, I just want to murder him with my shovel.

01:44:59.513 --> 01:45:02.075
[SPEAKER_09]: Or embed the axe in his stupid horse head.

01:45:02.775 --> 01:45:03.916
[SPEAKER_04]: And then bury him with the shovel.

01:45:04.416 --> 01:45:05.917
[SPEAKER_04]: And see if he grows into an ed tree.

01:45:06.677 --> 01:45:07.698
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

01:45:08.598 --> 01:45:10.780
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not even worth being fertilizer, okay?

01:45:11.764 --> 01:45:12.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Or glue.

01:45:12.544 --> 01:45:13.104
[SPEAKER_09]: Or glue.

01:45:13.525 --> 01:45:14.385
[SPEAKER_09]: Or even food.

01:45:14.705 --> 01:45:15.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Jell-O.

01:45:15.885 --> 01:45:16.906
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to a dark place.

01:45:16.946 --> 01:45:17.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

01:45:17.326 --> 01:45:18.506
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Punch-Out!

01:45:18.706 --> 01:45:19.607
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha ha!

01:45:20.207 --> 01:45:21.047
[SPEAKER_09]: Uppercut, uppercut.

01:45:22.728 --> 01:45:29.010
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Punch-Out is on Nintendo eShop for Wii U. And you can get it.

01:45:30.450 --> 01:45:32.791
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out in 1994 originally.

01:45:33.331 --> 01:45:36.793
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came out on Virtual Console for the Wii in 2009.

01:45:37.393 --> 01:45:40.314
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's going to be on...

01:45:40.954 --> 01:45:42.195
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Virtual Console for $8.

01:45:44.276 --> 01:45:45.236
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd buy that for a dollar.

01:45:45.416 --> 01:45:45.797
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

01:45:46.597 --> 01:45:49.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you bought it on Wii, then it will cost you just a dollar.

01:45:49.418 --> 01:45:50.579
[SPEAKER_04]: I think $1.50 gets Super Nintendo.

01:45:52.322 --> 01:46:01.067
[SPEAKER_09]: Also now for the PS3 people, there are two games coming out in Japan for PS3.

01:46:01.107 --> 01:46:03.729
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going to be Raiden 4.

01:46:03.969 --> 01:46:05.330
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I'm so happy.

01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:16.456
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to import that shit because I love... Dan and I were just listening to comparisons of the first Raiden game on different consoles, trying to listen to the music and stuff.

01:46:16.796 --> 01:46:18.237
[SPEAKER_09]: Found some were really awful.

01:46:19.158 --> 01:46:20.860
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know the Lynx version doesn't have any music?

01:46:21.841 --> 01:46:22.641
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really terrible.

01:46:23.582 --> 01:46:26.905
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other game coming out is Caladrius.

01:46:27.846 --> 01:46:33.931
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, Raiden 4 is going to be Raiden Overkill, and then Caladrius is going to be out in 2014 as well.

01:46:37.615 --> 01:46:43.260
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty, let's take a trip to our Fugle Question of the Week.

01:46:50.731 --> 01:46:55.255
[SPEAKER_04]: You take Facebook and you take Google Plus and you slam them together and you get Boogle.

01:46:55.676 --> 01:47:02.142
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go over to our Facebook and Google Plus communities where we're going to see some answers to our question, which is very simple this week.

01:47:02.182 --> 01:47:06.146
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a holiday show for the new year, the last show of the year.

01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:09.969
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is one very popular thing people like to do this time of year?

01:47:10.450 --> 01:47:13.693
[SPEAKER_04]: New Year's resolutions, which, you know, for better or worse, people do them.

01:47:14.093 --> 01:47:16.655
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be using DVR as my interval training.

01:47:35.367 --> 01:47:37.388
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of your resolution in a way.

01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:46.334
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I hate to use my whole exercise thing as a resolution, but I want to use DDR and other physical games as part of my training regimen.

01:47:46.595 --> 01:47:47.355
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fair enough.

01:47:48.216 --> 01:47:50.057
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see what some of our listeners said.

01:47:50.637 --> 01:47:55.380
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go over to Google+, where Actdeft said, Get a better gaming PC.

01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:59.803
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, getting an HDTV is one of my top gaming priorities.

01:48:00.204 --> 01:48:04.687
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, like every year, my top resolution is finishing my massive backlog of games.

01:48:06.107 --> 01:48:09.429
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment says, must accomplish project buy a house.

01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:13.292
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm assuming that's not an Animal Crossing reference, but it very well could be.

01:48:13.452 --> 01:48:14.792
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also on my list, too.

01:48:14.872 --> 01:48:17.234
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, now that I'm going to be working, Dan and I are buying a house.

01:48:18.054 --> 01:48:21.996
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving to a nicer studio for OLR is definitely on top of my list.

01:48:22.016 --> 01:48:24.158
[SPEAKER_09]: That could probably happen if we buy said house.

01:48:24.518 --> 01:48:25.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it'll be a race.

01:48:26.979 --> 01:48:30.622
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's go over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there.

01:48:30.642 --> 01:48:33.785
[SPEAKER_04]: We had quite a few answers over there, but I'm in a good mood.

01:48:33.805 --> 01:48:36.287
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have a lot of news tonight, so we should get through most of these.

01:48:37.107 --> 01:48:39.489
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy R. says, Finish more of the games I buy.

01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:41.110
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn Steam sales aren't helping.

01:48:42.431 --> 01:48:51.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Critical Myths says resolve to finish Mass Effect 3, play the two Dragon Age games, and do even more Assassin's Creed cosplay.

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:55.924
[SPEAKER_04]: Only finish Mass Effect 3 if you have the extended cut DLC downloaded and ready to go.

01:48:56.044 --> 01:48:57.145
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it, if you have it.

01:48:57.465 --> 01:49:00.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're like, but I want to see what it was like beforehand first.

01:49:00.428 --> 01:49:00.628
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:49:01.569 --> 01:49:02.049
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to.

01:49:02.169 --> 01:49:02.570
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't.

01:49:03.143 --> 01:49:03.884
[SPEAKER_09]: I made that mistake.

01:49:06.005 --> 01:49:09.787
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched them on the internet and I was like, download.

01:49:10.328 --> 01:49:11.028
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:49:11.489 --> 01:49:14.490
[SPEAKER_09]: I waited to beat my game so I could download the extended cut.

01:49:15.791 --> 01:49:16.292
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

01:49:16.912 --> 01:49:17.192
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:49:18.573 --> 01:49:19.614
[SPEAKER_04]: Going on to Fifth Dream.

01:49:19.734 --> 01:49:26.681
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe in making resolutions because I don't keep them, but if I did, it would be to stop hoarding games like a squirrel and his nuts in winter.

01:49:27.041 --> 01:49:32.266
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously probably have more games right now than I've played only once or never than all the other games I've had in my life.

01:49:32.646 --> 01:49:35.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, most cost $1.50 to $10, but still.

01:49:35.569 --> 01:49:36.610
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have that same problem.

01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:38.191
[SPEAKER_04]: Same problem.

01:49:38.251 --> 01:49:41.054
[SPEAKER_04]: Degenerate Johnny says, I vow to catch them all this year.

01:49:41.474 --> 01:49:42.675
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch what, you might ask?

01:49:42.996 --> 01:49:44.297
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave it to your imagination.

01:49:44.762 --> 01:49:47.223
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, you better have a good doctor.

01:49:48.184 --> 01:49:50.445
[SPEAKER_04]: He means all the cards in Hearthstone, obviously.

01:49:51.565 --> 01:49:58.909
[SPEAKER_04]: Tech2030 says, with a new Tales game and Tales HD re-release coming out next year, I want to go back and play through all the Tales of English releases.

01:49:59.389 --> 01:50:03.131
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get to replay the ones I finished and finally get to play through the ones sitting in my backlog.

01:50:04.191 --> 01:50:05.333
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Euros, isn't it?

01:50:20.711 --> 01:50:21.452
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:50:43.127 --> 01:50:45.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest VIII Flashback to 3-4 years ago OLR

01:51:05.749 --> 01:51:10.033
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually put the symbols in chat because they do look rather similar at a glance.

01:51:10.353 --> 01:51:11.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, from far away too.

01:51:12.875 --> 01:51:18.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel S replied and said, My gaming resolution is to stick to my game and not just jump from game to game.

01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:18.760
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

01:51:19.501 --> 01:51:22.683
[SPEAKER_04]: To do this, I vow to get at least three platinum trophies in 2014.

01:51:25.442 --> 01:51:45.162
[SPEAKER_04]: Codeman responds and says I would really like to dive more into Final Fantasy 14 took a little while off and now everybody has multiple 50s and it's crazy I may have gotten my second 50 this week I would just like to be more involved with a free company and run dungeons more etc etc now just to find the time well you know what they say real life greater than games

01:51:46.172 --> 01:51:47.353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's been my thing.

01:51:47.393 --> 01:51:48.133
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm still only 30.

01:51:49.973 --> 01:51:53.494
[SPEAKER_04]: Clover, well, the good thing is that game has level syncing.

01:51:53.694 --> 01:52:01.557
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Codeman and DarkSakura and anybody else in our free company, Omnigarsamer, just feel free to ask for help because everybody can level sync down and do stuff and it's still a challenge.

01:52:01.657 --> 01:52:06.118
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get, if you have like a level 48 or 49 character, you get great XP from it still.

01:52:06.838 --> 01:52:10.921
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually been using the level syncing a lot for doing Fates so that I can buy a stupid mount.

01:52:12.082 --> 01:52:16.026
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to get up to the job level so that I could buy my mount.

01:52:16.226 --> 01:52:18.207
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who else has been playing Final Fantasy XIV?

01:52:18.448 --> 01:52:19.268
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf.

01:52:19.368 --> 01:52:20.850
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf finally got into it.

01:52:20.890 --> 01:52:22.491
[SPEAKER_04]: He hasn't talked much about it, but he's playing.

01:52:24.933 --> 01:52:28.975
[SPEAKER_04]: Clover Nikon says purchase a Playstation 4 the latter half of 2014.

01:52:29.015 --> 01:52:31.917
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife and I both agree that any issues should be ironed out by them.

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:32.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

01:52:33.298 --> 01:52:34.019
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get one too.

01:52:34.079 --> 01:52:35.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully a little sooner but we'll see.

01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:38.242
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator says I don't really do New Year's resolutions.

01:52:38.282 --> 01:52:42.525
[SPEAKER_04]: The closest thing to that is what I've been doing all along since this past March.

01:52:42.965 --> 01:52:46.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy more Steam games, preferably when they're on sale, and play more games.

01:52:47.729 --> 01:53:00.399
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome Unicorn replied and said, My gaming resolution for 2014 is to ensure that no more than 50% of my playtime in Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII is spent recoloring and accessorizing Lightning's outfits.

01:53:00.839 --> 01:53:02.740
[SPEAKER_04]: This will take all of my willpower.

01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:09.706
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that answer because the extras in Final Fantasy and how far they really go, that is such an appropriate answer.

01:53:09.726 --> 01:53:09.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in

01:53:10.106 --> 01:53:23.208
[SPEAKER_02]: any game I probably sat there longer creating my character in Saints Row 3 than I did actually playing it that first night I might be ashamed to say how much time I've killed in Super Mario 64 stretching Mario's face in weird ways

01:53:24.926 --> 01:53:25.686
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the fun.

01:53:26.407 --> 01:53:31.109
[SPEAKER_04]: Osfer replies and says, I must play Final Fantasy X HD or else I will probably cry.

01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:35.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Also hoping that XV is released in 2014 after we've waited for so damn long.

01:53:37.012 --> 01:53:42.494
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt is last and says, My gaming resolution is to actually make a classic gaming setup in my place.

01:53:42.974 --> 01:53:48.217
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the bulk of my classic gaming stuff in boxes and have to keep swapping them out when I want to play anything.

01:53:48.637 --> 01:53:51.478
[SPEAKER_04]: What I would like is a full and nicely organized setup.

01:53:52.179 --> 01:53:52.619
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a...

01:53:52.999 --> 01:53:55.161
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro N5?

01:53:55.342 --> 01:53:56.423
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just Retro N?

01:53:56.523 --> 01:53:57.304
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that thing called?

01:53:57.424 --> 01:54:00.847
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it the Retron 5 just because I love Tron.

01:54:01.728 --> 01:54:10.196
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's cheating, but considering what you have to do to get enough inputs for classic games like that, not to mention if you don't even have composite.

01:54:10.937 --> 01:54:13.700
[SPEAKER_09]: And on top of that, a modern TV is going to have...

01:54:16.526 --> 01:54:26.152
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that we did ours at the old house was that we had the switch boxes behind with these demo monitors that Dan got when Game Crazy closed.

01:54:27.053 --> 01:54:33.497
[SPEAKER_09]: And with our switch boxes and the component in, we were just able to hit the box in the middle and we had everything out on one shelf.

01:54:33.517 --> 01:54:43.925
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another guy who has his set up to where he used crates with LED lights at the top of each crate so that it would turn on whatever system was active.

01:54:43.945 --> 01:54:44.165
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

01:54:44.805 --> 01:54:46.025
[SPEAKER_09]: and there's ways to do it.

01:54:46.065 --> 01:54:54.348
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to get a little creative, but there are ways to organize it to where not only are your systems there ready to play, but they are also on display.

01:54:54.408 --> 01:54:58.689
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little foolish for me to jump straight to the retro end because compatibility, if nothing else...

01:55:02.290 --> 01:55:29.265
[SPEAKER_02]: the HDMI, I mean like TigerClaw says in the chatroom, Retron 5 looks interesting the fact you can play your old games over HDMI that right there is so appealing to me just the cable space and everything I know it's not the same same but close enough I have, because of my emulation history and everything else, I would have no problem with something like that, not to mention I don't own those classic systems anymore I've given a lot of them away to various friends that don't need new gaming consoles and just want to play an old fun game

01:55:29.985 --> 01:55:39.275
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I've helped them along with that not to mention the only system I owned before Playstation was an SNES but I have neither anymore you own one?

01:55:40.356 --> 01:55:51.968
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have three or four well I think all my games went with it we have extras I am not in the mood to start scavenging and building up and paying for all those cartridges again

01:55:52.569 --> 01:55:54.773
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually are probably going to be downsizing the vault, by the way.

01:55:55.074 --> 01:55:55.775
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no.

01:55:57.518 --> 01:55:58.760
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to move with all that stuff?

01:55:59.161 --> 01:56:00.183
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:56:00.724 --> 01:56:03.008
[SPEAKER_09]: A good two-thirds of it is in storage at Dan's mom's house.

01:56:04.471 --> 01:56:05.511
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:56:33.761 --> 01:56:39.823
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into some more news, and then we'll get into list lists and all that in just a little bit.

01:56:40.143 --> 01:56:41.044
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you want to start us off?

01:56:42.024 --> 01:56:51.907
[SPEAKER_12]: So, like most console games, now Battlefield 4 has been banned in China, and probably has a little bit to do with the China Rising expansion.

01:56:52.607 --> 01:56:56.049
[SPEAKER_12]: They say that it was banned for national security reasons.

01:56:57.269 --> 01:57:03.191
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know, maybe they just didn't like the view of China in that game.

01:57:05.393 --> 01:57:16.397
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, do you think it's one of those games where EA might want to put out a different version to try, or just no, they're just going to write it off?

01:57:17.377 --> 01:57:18.357
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're going to write it off.

01:57:18.377 --> 01:57:19.298
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of think so, too.

01:57:19.318 --> 01:57:28.421
[SPEAKER_12]: Because basically, the main problem with it is that they're saying that the campaign of that takes place, a Chinese admiral is planning to overthrow the government.

01:57:29.041 --> 01:57:33.803
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that they really want to promote or glorify there.

01:57:35.424 --> 01:57:36.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very true.

01:57:36.884 --> 01:57:41.486
[SPEAKER_02]: Do games have similar scenarios with just the legit American government?

01:57:42.166 --> 01:57:47.928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually like you're taking down a terrorist faction that already did the deed of overthrowing the government.

01:57:48.708 --> 01:57:51.649
[SPEAKER_02]: Or future post-apocalyptic, something like that.

01:57:51.909 --> 01:57:54.330
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking like Modern Warfare 2 and 3, that kind of stuff.

01:57:56.730 --> 01:58:05.153
[SPEAKER_12]: There's always some sort of corrupt government entity in any of these, especially a lot of the military first-person shooters and stuff.

01:58:06.311 --> 01:58:15.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, always some kind of a nefarious, what's the word, ne'er-do-well that is the actual focal point of all of this kind of stuff.

01:58:17.509 --> 01:58:19.410
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest X is an MMO game that exists on the Wii U.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.881
[SPEAKER_04]: but some people still talking about Dragon Quest XI.

01:58:40.441 --> 01:58:46.622
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I guess there was some thought that Dragon Quest XI could be mobile, that it could end up being a mobile game.

01:58:46.662 --> 01:58:53.683
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, after all, Square has been putting out more and more stuff on the iPhone, iPad, iOS system and Android and so forth.

01:58:53.703 --> 01:58:56.643
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, what, Final Fantasy 3, 4, 5 are all there.

01:58:56.983 --> 01:58:59.684
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 6 actually just is coming out or just came out.

01:59:00.404 --> 01:59:05.585
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of stopped downloading all those because they're a little bit pricey and, you know, they're not as good as the originals.

01:59:06.005 --> 01:59:33.453
[SPEAKER_04]: but some folks thinking that Dragon Quest XI might go that way but Square Enix mobile developer Takehiro Ando would like to clarify some things in a Fumitsu column saying quote at the current stage there are no talks about making Dragon Quest XI for smartphones I believe there's still plenty left to overcome before we release a proper sequel for smartphones so we don't know when Dragon Quest XI will be out or what system it will be on I would

01:59:33.993 --> 01:59:41.278
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine it nearly matches the experience of Dragon Quest X on like Wii U or something, but then again, you'd be surprised.

02:00:01.853 --> 02:00:04.214
[SPEAKER_04]: It was originally on Wii, now that I think about it.

02:00:04.254 --> 02:00:05.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U was like a special version.

02:00:05.234 --> 02:00:06.214
[SPEAKER_04]: It was originally on Wii.

02:00:06.475 --> 02:00:08.735
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be surprised how well some of this stuff can do mobily.

02:00:09.696 --> 02:00:15.938
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a fair number of MOBAs and MMOs and they find ways of making it work.

02:00:16.058 --> 02:00:20.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Input schemes that people are willing to put up with to play on their favorite franchise.

02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:23.660
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

02:00:24.696 --> 02:00:25.257
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:50.087
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the collection is including the Atari 2600, the ColecoVision, but the games don't yet have sound, however they will.

02:00:50.688 --> 02:00:55.252
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, the BBC is covering this now because the archive apparently is expanding.

02:00:57.433 --> 02:00:57.654
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

02:00:58.054 --> 02:00:58.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

02:00:59.035 --> 02:01:00.676
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of cool stuff can I play in there?

02:01:01.997 --> 02:01:02.678
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, um...

02:01:04.702 --> 02:01:09.563
[SPEAKER_09]: The worry is that some of these are going to be illegal because they're ROMs.

02:01:09.743 --> 02:01:10.984
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to have the emulator to play them.

02:01:12.584 --> 02:01:20.906
[SPEAKER_09]: But the much older games are supposed to be available for legal play and it's not actually listing a specific type.

02:01:20.986 --> 02:01:21.586
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, there we go.

02:01:21.606 --> 02:01:23.907
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Frogger are in the archives.

02:01:24.487 --> 02:01:32.249
[SPEAKER_09]: They are also including Atari 7800, Magnavox Odyssey, which in Europe was the Philips VideoPak G7000, and the Astrocade.

02:01:33.269 --> 02:01:33.369
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

02:01:34.943 --> 02:01:35.183
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

02:01:35.423 --> 02:01:36.664
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

02:01:36.684 --> 02:01:37.605
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's expanded.

02:01:38.845 --> 02:01:48.651
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, from the classics to the future, you guys, it's time to predict 2014 in a segment we call here at Orange Lounge Radio, Listless!

02:01:51.886 --> 02:02:00.532
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and of course, as the show where every gamer has a voice, you guys listening live play an important role in the listless process.

02:02:00.572 --> 02:02:04.575
[SPEAKER_04]: So head on over to live.vognetwork.com so you can play along with us.

02:02:05.195 --> 02:02:12.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you listening on the podcast, I'm sorry we don't yet have the functionality for the podcast listeners to participate to, but that is something we are working on for 2014.

02:02:12.681 --> 02:02:16.564
[SPEAKER_04]: So listen along and have fun with us as we predict tonight's question...

02:02:18.484 --> 02:02:20.805
[SPEAKER_04]: What will happen in gaming in 2014?

02:02:21.386 --> 02:02:24.127
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your gaming predictions for 2014?

02:02:24.467 --> 02:02:35.252
[SPEAKER_04]: Now to take a walk down memory lane real quick, let me see if I can pull this up real quick because we actually have, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's an Orange Lounge Radio Wikia.

02:02:35.652 --> 02:02:35.972
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

02:02:53.032 --> 02:02:54.552
[SPEAKER_04]: On this show, what is the inside joke?

02:02:55.113 --> 02:03:00.474
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check that out, orangeloungeradio.wikia.com Midna found the ferret, by the way Did she?

02:03:00.754 --> 02:03:21.581
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes Well, one of the pages there on the wikia is listless And it tells you every definitive list we've ever come up with here on Orange Lounge Radio Because this is a process where we will come up with the definitive list And so last year, at this time, we did 2013 predictions So shall I remind you about what we predicted for 2013?

02:03:22.841 --> 02:03:24.362
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Lube is $100 with Commitment

02:03:54.588 --> 02:03:58.993
[SPEAKER_04]: A Vita price drop before the first anniversary, which that did happen, right?

02:03:59.173 --> 02:03:59.754
[SPEAKER_04]: That did happen.

02:04:00.074 --> 02:04:02.197
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.

02:04:02.257 --> 02:04:03.498
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were one for four.

02:04:04.319 --> 02:04:04.860
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:08.103
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of the Xbox loop being $100 worth of commitment, it's $100 more with dementia and brainwashing.

02:04:11.727 --> 02:04:17.055
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there's the voice of Alan Alchemy who's going to be sitting in on Listless with us tonight.

02:04:17.095 --> 02:04:17.495
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Alan.

02:04:17.535 --> 02:04:17.856
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

02:04:18.296 --> 02:04:18.497
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

02:04:18.917 --> 02:04:20.159
[SPEAKER_04]: What a good introduction there.

02:04:20.419 --> 02:04:20.620
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:26.448
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to fade the music there a little earlier because I don't want YouTube saying, oh, oh, you don't own that song.

02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.650
[SPEAKER_04]: So there we go.

02:04:28.110 --> 02:04:29.192
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, getting into listless night.

02:04:29.452 --> 02:04:34.681
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that have never heard listless before, it is a very scientific process.

02:04:34.701 --> 02:04:36.684
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no arguing people with this list.

02:04:37.745 --> 02:04:42.373
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the list of predictions for 2014, the official gaming community predictions.

02:04:43.354 --> 02:04:44.495
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:05:07.054 --> 02:05:08.214
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's put it up on the board.

02:05:08.274 --> 02:05:11.356
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:05:11.436 --> 02:05:14.016
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your gaming predictions for 2014?

02:05:14.377 --> 02:05:24.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Participating tonight with us, of course, DarkSakura, Loki, VXJasonXV, the voice of the show, myself, and Alan Alchemy, as you just heard there a minute ago.

02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:25.400
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, how are you, Alan?

02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:26.521
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been playing these days?

02:05:26.721 --> 02:05:28.961
[SPEAKER_04]: What does a gaming week look like for you these days?

02:05:29.181 --> 02:05:30.702
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of Final Fantasy XIV.

02:05:30.842 --> 02:05:31.102
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

02:05:31.942 --> 02:05:33.683
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been accomplishing in that game?

02:05:34.495 --> 02:05:35.717
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on my relic.

02:05:36.678 --> 02:05:37.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Working on your relic?

02:05:37.659 --> 02:05:39.040
[SPEAKER_04]: His big number has been getting bigger.

02:05:39.261 --> 02:05:39.721
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

02:05:39.781 --> 02:05:40.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Big number's getting bigger.

02:05:41.363 --> 02:05:42.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster's getting bigger.

02:05:42.324 --> 02:05:43.185
[SPEAKER_04]: Fight's getting crazier.

02:05:43.745 --> 02:05:43.986
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:05:45.182 --> 02:05:45.402
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

02:06:10.498 --> 02:06:14.200
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your number three pick for gaming prediction for 2014?

02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:16.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Serious or silly, whatever you want.

02:06:17.061 --> 02:06:19.722
[SPEAKER_09]: World of Warcraft loses over a million subscribers over the course of 2014.

02:06:21.063 --> 02:06:23.004
[SPEAKER_04]: So WoW loses a million more.

02:06:23.944 --> 02:06:24.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Over.

02:06:24.204 --> 02:06:27.506
[SPEAKER_09]: A minimum of a million subscribers over the course of 2014.

02:06:28.306 --> 02:06:30.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so why do you say that?

02:06:31.427 --> 02:06:32.288
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's shit.

02:06:36.225 --> 02:06:48.832
[SPEAKER_09]: I still like WoW I just don't think the new expansion even with as much as it kind of had me excited I don't think it's enough to save it it's too little too late they're just throwing bones now

02:06:49.632 --> 02:07:07.545
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah they may get a few lore nerds back and happy and I'm a lore nerd I liked I how many of those books are on my shelves you know and I would probably you know play for a week to see the content and then quit again so it's just not enough for me

02:07:08.012 --> 02:07:11.455
[SPEAKER_04]: After Mario Kart 8 fails to sell enough consoles for Nintendo, they will finally drop the price.

02:07:34.209 --> 02:07:37.370
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mario Kart 8 is going to do fucking fantastic, but I think a price drop is going to happen.

02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:38.350
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's my thing too.

02:07:38.370 --> 02:07:40.531
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think Mario Kart 8 is going to do really well.

02:07:40.571 --> 02:07:41.671
[SPEAKER_02]: But why do you think it's going to fail?

02:07:41.691 --> 02:07:45.993
[SPEAKER_04]: You just think it's going to fail because there's not going to be the Wii U's out there or whatever?

02:07:58.634 --> 02:08:04.037
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it can still be a good game, but it's just not going to be enough for people to buy the console for.

02:08:04.077 --> 02:08:10.941
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, some people might, but it's just not going to be enough to make a huge enough difference to where all of a sudden it's going to be a 3DS.

02:08:12.046 --> 02:08:15.308
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a good thing we have an elimination round.

02:08:15.389 --> 02:08:20.372
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, am I being meaner by saying that it's going to drop anyways as compared to Loki?

02:08:21.113 --> 02:08:23.014
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because I do think it will drop in price.

02:08:23.054 --> 02:08:25.376
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all the consoles will drop in price next holiday.

02:08:25.416 --> 02:08:25.956
[SPEAKER_04]: They all will.

02:08:26.136 --> 02:08:27.737
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Wii U will be two years old next year.

02:08:27.757 --> 02:08:28.958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but we'll see.

02:08:29.599 --> 02:08:29.959
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

02:08:29.979 --> 02:08:31.100
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put it on the board anyway.

02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:34.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 fails, Wii U price dropped.

02:08:34.722 --> 02:08:39.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, I know you just said he jacked one of your answers, but I've got to pick on you now.

02:08:39.906 --> 02:08:41.307
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three, what's your number three answer?

02:08:41.727 --> 02:08:43.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Half-Life 3?

02:08:43.431 --> 02:08:44.232
[SPEAKER_02]: Question mark?

02:08:44.493 --> 02:08:45.374
[SPEAKER_02]: Smiley face?

02:08:45.595 --> 02:08:46.416
[SPEAKER_02]: Frowny face?

02:08:46.597 --> 02:08:47.599
[SPEAKER_02]: Won't get released

02:08:51.994 --> 02:08:55.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Half-Life 3, question mark, smiley face, won't get released.

02:08:56.178 --> 02:09:06.668
[SPEAKER_11]: Won't get released, which is kind of vague because that allows for an announcement or do you think 2014 is going to be a complete information void toilet for Half-Life 3 still?

02:09:06.748 --> 02:09:07.990
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it already has been.

02:09:08.931 --> 02:09:10.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Hasn't it always been?

02:09:11.813 --> 02:09:16.158
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect it to change, but I'm going to stick squarely with no Half-Life 3.

02:09:17.618 --> 02:09:44.303
[SPEAKER_04]: so there it is up on the board Half-Life 3 won't get released up on the board next to duh and of course alright I'm just kidding alright alright my number three answer I'll go next with my number three answer my number three answer and I know I'm gonna have like two of you guys going god damn it that's what I picked my number three answer is Ouya goes under Ouya calls it a day I just I

02:09:45.263 --> 02:09:46.725
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's... You went there?

02:09:47.125 --> 02:09:58.477
[SPEAKER_04]: I went there, I'm sorry, but it's just one of those things that had a huge fanfare and now it's kind of went... And, you know, I realize they're doing great things for indies and all that, but I just... But OUYA 2, Rob, OUYA 2.

02:09:58.517 --> 02:10:00.098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OUYA 2 soon, so...

[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:27.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, they're going to lose a million subs, and then they're going to fail and you're still not going to get your damn game, and then the company's going to go under.

02:10:27.786 --> 02:10:32.970
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Alan, maybe you have a cheerful number three answer, or maybe you don't, but what is your number three answer?

02:10:33.250 --> 02:10:42.477
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, you pointing that out made me think of something really dark and grim that I wasn't going to say previously, so whether or not I say it is... Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!

02:10:42.878 --> 02:10:43.978
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants Alan to go there?

02:10:44.339 --> 02:10:47.221
[SPEAKER_04]: Go there, go there, go there!

02:10:47.641 --> 02:10:51.263
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the big Nintendo godfathers of gaming will pass away.

02:10:52.323 --> 02:10:52.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

02:10:53.084 --> 02:10:54.444
[SPEAKER_04]: That is too soon.

02:10:54.724 --> 02:10:55.325
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:10:55.445 --> 02:10:56.365
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't say that.

02:10:56.405 --> 02:10:57.105
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, he can.

02:10:57.465 --> 02:10:59.086
[SPEAKER_11]: The Zelda Mario dude.

02:10:59.846 --> 02:11:00.227
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them.

02:11:00.287 --> 02:11:01.147
[SPEAKER_11]: The Final Fantasy.

02:11:01.327 --> 02:11:02.808
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the big 8-bit godfathers.

02:11:02.828 --> 02:11:04.549
[SPEAKER_04]: You are awful and you should feel awful.

02:11:04.589 --> 02:11:07.150
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all like pushing 70, right?

02:11:07.410 --> 02:11:08.830
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not very old anymore.

02:11:09.251 --> 02:11:11.892
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's true, but people fall downstairs every day.

02:11:13.833 --> 02:11:19.077
[SPEAKER_09]: This is supposed to be a funny segment, you guys!

02:11:20.118 --> 02:11:22.119
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't have thought of it if you didn't point it out.

02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.243
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna need everybody to eliminate number three answers.

02:11:27.964 --> 02:11:32.247
[SPEAKER_12]: But wouldn't falling down stairs be kind of ironic in the whole Paul Walker ironic?

02:11:32.307 --> 02:11:37.451
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, they do have to climb stairs at the very end of each Mario level to jump on the goalposts.

02:11:38.064 --> 02:11:43.425
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it would be ironic if he gets kidnapped by a monkey and taken to the top of a skyrise.

02:11:43.505 --> 02:11:44.586
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be ironic.

02:11:47.006 --> 02:11:47.406
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:11:48.087 --> 02:11:48.447
Wow.

02:11:49.067 --> 02:11:54.128
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to need us all to – let's try to make it a little bit happier going to number two, and then we'll just eliminate all the threes.

02:11:54.248 --> 02:11:54.548
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:11:55.528 --> 02:11:56.008
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:11:56.069 --> 02:11:56.889
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try again.

02:11:56.949 --> 02:12:00.750
[SPEAKER_04]: Your number two – so far, since I have to read it anyway, the super dark 2014 –

02:12:02.330 --> 02:12:03.971
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming Crash, number two predictions list.

02:12:04.591 --> 02:12:06.051
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW loses a million subs over the year.

02:12:06.151 --> 02:12:07.192
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 fails.

02:12:07.232 --> 02:12:07.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U price drop.

02:12:08.212 --> 02:12:09.532
[SPEAKER_04]: Half-Life 3 won't get released.

02:12:09.633 --> 02:12:12.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouya goes under and 8-bit Godfather passes.

02:12:12.533 --> 02:12:12.874
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:12:13.914 --> 02:12:15.274
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go on to the number two.

02:12:15.414 --> 02:12:16.675
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy, shiny answers.

02:12:16.755 --> 02:12:17.455
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

02:12:17.655 --> 02:12:18.455
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop influencing me.

02:12:18.636 --> 02:12:18.916
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:12:19.336 --> 02:12:21.036
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is your number two answer?

02:12:21.176 --> 02:12:25.898
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be another huge shipping war on Tumblr based on screenshots for the next Mass Effect.

02:12:28.783 --> 02:12:30.687
[SPEAKER_09]: And remind us if you do not know what shipping means.

02:12:37.771 --> 02:13:04.344
[SPEAKER_09]: relationships people fucking because it's fan driven there's a big annoyance I have with just oh these two characters are friends they're fucking no they might not be fucking but no it's basically the shipping is going to happen based on screen captures people are going to make assumptions Tumblr is going to piss themselves and ship all the things

02:13:05.427 --> 02:13:09.811
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura's number two answer, the internet will exist, is up on the board.

02:13:09.871 --> 02:13:10.511
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

02:13:11.552 --> 02:13:13.614
[SPEAKER_02]: Rule 34 will continue its stride.

02:13:13.654 --> 02:13:15.515
[SPEAKER_09]: Mass Effect 4 will be shipped before it ships.

02:13:15.676 --> 02:13:18.378
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

02:13:18.478 --> 02:13:23.922
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I should really change that to say new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

02:13:23.942 --> 02:13:26.144
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll change that answer a little bit there and alter that on the board.

02:13:26.905 --> 02:13:27.205
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:13:27.785 --> 02:13:30.468
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, dare I ask, your number two answer.

02:13:31.693 --> 02:13:33.496
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually don't have a negative one this time.

02:13:33.756 --> 02:13:39.926
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 will be out next year.

02:13:43.257 --> 02:13:43.617
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

02:13:43.717 --> 02:13:47.621
[SPEAKER_04]: Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 makes its way out next year.

02:13:47.961 --> 02:13:48.641
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems logical.

02:13:48.842 --> 02:13:55.287
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be really weird when L4D4, Left 4 Dead 4 comes out just because numbers.

02:13:55.707 --> 02:14:03.874
[SPEAKER_12]: The thought was because when they announced Portal 2 they made Portal 1 free to download temporarily.

02:14:04.434 --> 02:14:10.900
[SPEAKER_12]: Same with Left 4 Dead 2 just happened where they made it free for a day just to build up the user base of it.

02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:11.100
[SPEAKER_12]: So

02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:13.844
[SPEAKER_12]: Most likely an announcement will be coming soon for that.

02:14:15.265 --> 02:14:27.753
[SPEAKER_11]: I've theorized previously that Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 running for a year will be the testing, putting the toe in the water that Valve needs to make any sort of announcement on Half-Life 3.

02:14:27.933 --> 02:14:29.474
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope!

02:14:29.994 --> 02:14:30.575
[SPEAKER_11]: Announcement?

02:14:32.416 --> 02:14:33.397
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have that conversation.

02:14:33.417 --> 02:14:34.518
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's not even an entry.

02:14:34.678 --> 02:14:36.120
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just... No, that's fine.

02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:36.900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:37.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, it's not your turn.

02:14:39.122 --> 02:14:40.824
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, what is your number two answer?

02:14:40.844 --> 02:14:42.825
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm personally ready for L4D20.

02:14:43.806 --> 02:14:44.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

02:14:44.327 --> 02:14:44.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

02:14:45.968 --> 02:14:48.390
[SPEAKER_02]: Oculus Rift released 4K resolution.

02:14:51.313 --> 02:14:53.435
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to their current expectation, which is...

02:14:55.448 --> 02:15:05.556
[SPEAKER_04]: 128800?

02:14:55.588 --> 02:15:05.556
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gonna say, we know Oculus Rift is coming, but you say Oculus Rift is gonna, it's gonna They're gonna blow something away with resolution and quality and not just current expectations.

02:15:05.576 --> 02:15:07.338
[SPEAKER_04]: It is real fucking life, y'all.

02:15:07.358 --> 02:15:07.698
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

02:15:08.078 --> 02:15:09.860
[SPEAKER_04]: Oculus Rift, real fucking life.

02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:11.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

02:15:11.481 --> 02:15:13.162
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is, up on the board.

02:15:13.903 --> 02:15:23.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that is so funny that you bring up the Oculus Rift, and it is really funny because also in chat we had SSJ100Matt says, one of the big three will announce an Oculus Rift type of device.

02:15:23.290 --> 02:15:29.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, funny enough, I swear I had this written before the show tonight, but my number two answer, Microsoft jacks the Rift.

02:15:30.896 --> 02:15:32.757
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Microsoft love to do?

02:15:32.958 --> 02:15:38.402
[SPEAKER_04]: They are going to take an idea that's popular in gaming and improve on it best they can.

02:15:38.542 --> 02:15:40.623
[SPEAKER_04]: I fully expect Microsoft to jack the Rift.

02:15:40.643 --> 02:15:42.424
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure improve is the case either.

02:15:42.485 --> 02:15:44.726
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not buy Oculus Rift?

02:15:44.766 --> 02:15:48.269
[SPEAKER_11]: Because for Microsoft to fit that MO perfectly, they usually absorb

02:15:48.849 --> 02:15:50.030
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:16:18.507 --> 02:16:22.108
[SPEAKER_04]: But Microsoft jacks the rift is my number two answer, and I'm putting it up on the board.

02:16:22.168 --> 02:16:22.448
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:16:23.529 --> 02:16:27.010
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Alchemy, last but not least, with your number two answer.

02:16:27.550 --> 02:16:38.193
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo finally brings DS, not 3DS, but DS ROMs to a store on the Wii U. And somehow they make it disappointing.

02:16:42.092 --> 02:16:45.595
[SPEAKER_11]: I love how you had to tack on the, and it's disappointing, just to keep it down.

02:16:45.615 --> 02:16:53.542
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether it be the price, or the games that they actually announce for it, or how it plays, they'll do it and it'll somehow still be stupid.

02:16:54.382 --> 02:16:56.824
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, again, another dark answer tonight.

02:16:56.864 --> 02:17:00.748
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints.

02:17:01.468 --> 02:17:02.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Womp womp.

02:17:02.729 --> 02:17:04.610
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there it is, your number two answer.

02:17:04.650 --> 02:17:07.231
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's run through the board real quick.

02:17:07.612 --> 02:17:09.793
[SPEAKER_04]: We have new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

02:17:09.853 --> 02:17:11.354
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW loses a million subs over the year.

02:17:11.694 --> 02:17:13.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 is out.

02:17:13.255 --> 02:17:15.316
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 fails and the Wii U price has dropped.

02:17:15.696 --> 02:17:17.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Oculus Rift released in 4K resolution.

02:17:17.997 --> 02:17:19.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Half-Life 3 won't get released.

02:17:19.758 --> 02:17:20.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft jacks the Rift.

02:17:20.999 --> 02:17:21.699
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouya goes under.

02:17:21.899 --> 02:17:24.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints.

02:17:24.701 --> 02:17:36.465
[SPEAKER_04]: 8-Bit Godfather Passes Alright, now it is time for the number one answer The thing you most predict for 2014 DarkSakura, what is your number one prediction?

02:17:40.386 --> 02:17:52.770
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually been drawing a blank the entire time I mean, so I am going to say that an innovation within the video game industry leads to new advances for people with disabilities

02:17:57.395 --> 02:18:00.357
[SPEAKER_09]: Like maybe Vision for the Blind.

02:18:00.397 --> 02:18:03.998
[SPEAKER_09]: They're already working on bionic ocular implants.

02:18:04.599 --> 02:18:06.420
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are a legit thing now.

02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:10.562
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're working on bionic oculus rift plans.

02:18:13.111 --> 02:18:15.453
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to knock this shit off real fast.

02:18:15.593 --> 02:18:16.094
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

02:18:16.174 --> 02:18:20.198
[SPEAKER_04]: So an unknown innovation in the video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

02:18:20.258 --> 02:18:22.160
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to shorten that a little bit.

02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:23.381
[SPEAKER_09]: We're already seeing it happen.

02:18:23.841 --> 02:18:28.166
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that something really big is going to happen that's going to turn around a lot of the negative press.

02:18:28.766 --> 02:18:29.167
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope.

02:18:30.528 --> 02:18:31.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, did you have something to add to that?

02:18:33.095 --> 02:18:35.877
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I was just telling Jason to stop it.

02:18:37.779 --> 02:18:40.501
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, shut them up with your number one answer, Loki.

02:18:40.521 --> 02:18:42.742
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the number one prediction for 2014?

02:18:43.703 --> 02:18:52.469
[SPEAKER_12]: I've only been saying this the entire year, but I'm hoping that they'll do this because they'll definitely beef up what they have available for the system.

02:18:53.790 --> 02:19:02.557
[SPEAKER_12]: 3DS games on the Wii U using the gamepad as the bottom screen, TV as the top screen.

02:19:04.161 --> 02:19:11.583
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to just one-up what Alan said and say 3DS games on the Wii U. Well, I've been saying it all year long.

02:19:12.003 --> 02:19:13.904
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an inevitability.

02:19:14.644 --> 02:19:15.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

02:19:15.404 --> 02:19:16.465
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you can put what he wants.

02:19:16.485 --> 02:19:16.785
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

02:19:16.865 --> 02:19:21.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's up on the board with 3DS games on the Wii U. He did leave out the point, though, that it disappoints.

02:19:21.386 --> 02:19:22.366
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for what it's worth.

02:19:22.426 --> 02:19:22.986
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is.

02:19:23.627 --> 02:19:24.507
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so there it is.

02:19:24.567 --> 02:19:25.567
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's number one answer.

02:19:25.607 --> 02:19:26.487
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, we're over to you.

02:19:26.527 --> 02:19:28.288
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your number one prediction?

02:19:28.888 --> 02:19:30.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Jesus.

02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

02:19:34.125 --> 02:19:45.168
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go with indie game released to such fanfare they get signed on to a major publisher for a AAA release.

02:19:46.088 --> 02:19:53.230
[SPEAKER_02]: The release doesn't have to happen, but the groundswell and fanfare has to happen in 2014.

02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:59.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Indie game signed on to produce AAA port of same game.

02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:06.951
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to shorten that to say Indie goes from Indie to AAA in the scope of a year.

02:20:07.891 --> 02:20:08.151
[SPEAKER_10]: It works.

02:20:08.371 --> 02:20:08.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

02:20:09.312 --> 02:20:11.532
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say Indie Game and put that on the board.

02:20:11.972 --> 02:20:14.493
[SPEAKER_04]: Any idea what that type of game could be?

02:20:16.693 --> 02:20:17.193
[SPEAKER_02]: A good one.

02:20:17.213 --> 02:20:18.434
[SPEAKER_02]: If you knew it, you'd be a millionaire.

02:20:18.454 --> 02:20:18.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

02:20:19.634 --> 02:20:19.894
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:20:19.914 --> 02:20:20.674
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be a millionaire.

02:20:20.834 --> 02:20:21.174
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:20:22.074 --> 02:20:24.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Bochikawa says, so like what happened with Portal?

02:20:25.175 --> 02:20:26.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that, right?

02:20:27.676 --> 02:20:30.876
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that actually was kind of it because it was that Narbacular Drop.

02:20:32.977 --> 02:20:34.777
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my number one answer.

02:20:35.457 --> 02:20:35.838
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

02:20:35.898 --> 02:20:36.598
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a long one.

02:20:36.618 --> 02:20:38.398
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how I'm going to shorten this for the board, but here it is.

02:20:38.458 --> 02:20:39.298
[SPEAKER_04]: My number one answer.

02:20:40.879 --> 02:20:46.560
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2014, the year of Captain Falcon, F-Zero U is announced.

02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:50.721
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the greatest game ever made and Wii U haters can shove it.

02:20:51.906 --> 02:21:09.695
[SPEAKER_02]: Falcon Punch That is my number one answer, Falcon Punch F-Zero Boner Party That's how you condense that down That works, Nintendo's Year of Captain Falcon That's what they're going to call it, F-Zero Boner Party Nintendo's Year of Falcon Punch Nintendo's Year of Falcon Boner

02:21:12.265 --> 02:21:13.686
[SPEAKER_04]: I will accept that shortening.

02:21:13.746 --> 02:21:17.507
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

02:21:17.827 --> 02:21:18.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough, I like it.

02:21:19.027 --> 02:21:21.468
[SPEAKER_04]: It is up on the board as my number one answer.

02:21:21.908 --> 02:21:27.930
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that means we are down to one more prediction to go up on the board.

02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:30.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Just before we hear Alan's answer, some of the things we see in chat.

02:21:31.352 --> 02:21:58.934
[SPEAKER_04]: Tech2030 says Nintendo comes out with a 3DS player peripheral for the Wii U Fifth Dream says a Final Fantasy XIV expansion GameGuru says 2014 the year we predict disappointments in gaming Tigerclaw says in 2014 Gabe Newell will announce the release date for the Half-Life movie Degenerate Johnny says Nintendo pulls a Disney and starts buying up purchasable third-party LPs or IPs maybe

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:03.214
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was saying Let's Plays.

02:22:03.554 --> 02:22:04.636
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Let's Plays.

02:22:04.996 --> 02:22:05.496
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got it.

02:22:05.576 --> 02:22:05.897
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.

02:22:06.658 --> 02:22:09.560
[SPEAKER_04]: Degenerate Johnny says Hearthstone will remain in beta throughout the whole year.

02:22:09.681 --> 02:22:11.202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a womp womp.

02:22:11.723 --> 02:22:12.083
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:22:12.383 --> 02:22:13.224
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked SSJ 100 Nets.

02:22:13.244 --> 02:22:14.025
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that one?

02:22:14.345 --> 02:22:16.067
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get thrown out next year.

02:22:16.848 --> 02:22:17.989
[SPEAKER_02]: You already got thrown out last week.

02:22:18.009 --> 02:22:18.850
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I said.

02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:19.270
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:22:19.610 --> 02:22:21.252
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can happen again in 2014.

02:22:21.412 --> 02:22:23.494
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, there is one spot left on the list.

02:22:23.674 --> 02:22:25.116
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you put in there as your number one prediction?

02:22:25.504 --> 02:22:35.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Bethesda confirms and gives an ETA for either the next campaign Elder Scrolls game or Fallout 4 That's too wide of a net Which one?

02:22:36.956 --> 02:22:43.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Fallout 4 We've been waiting longer for that So Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 And gives an ETA And gives an ETA

02:22:45.199 --> 02:22:47.100
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there an article about that in the last week or two?

02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:49.241
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds awfully familiar.

02:22:49.321 --> 02:22:50.742
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be probably out in October.

02:22:50.862 --> 02:22:51.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

02:22:51.442 --> 02:22:52.162
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that's a guy.

02:22:52.182 --> 02:22:53.263
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's an E3 given.

02:22:53.463 --> 02:22:53.983
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

02:22:54.023 --> 02:22:54.864
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:22:55.064 --> 02:22:55.264
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

02:22:55.284 --> 02:22:55.504
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:22:55.804 --> 02:22:56.344
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is.

02:22:57.065 --> 02:22:57.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, you guys.

02:22:57.925 --> 02:22:59.326
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what the board says right now.

02:23:00.126 --> 02:23:02.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

02:23:03.268 --> 02:23:05.168
[SPEAKER_04]: New Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

02:23:05.529 --> 02:23:07.790
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW loses 1 million subs over the year.

02:23:07.810 --> 02:23:10.611
[SPEAKER_04]: 3DS games on the Wii U. Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.

02:23:10.911 --> 02:23:13.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 fails and Wii U prices dropped.

02:23:14.312 --> 02:23:16.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Indie game goes from Indie to AAA in the scope of a year.

02:23:17.013 --> 02:23:19.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Oculus Rift released with a 4K resolution.

02:23:19.393 --> 02:23:21.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Half-Life 3 won't get released.

02:23:21.494 --> 02:23:24.595
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

02:23:24.975 --> 02:23:26.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft jacks the Rift.

02:23:26.635 --> 02:23:27.356
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouya goes under.

02:23:27.616 --> 02:23:29.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives ETA.

02:23:30.076 --> 02:23:33.077
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints.

02:23:33.597 --> 02:23:35.858
[SPEAKER_04]: And 8-bit Godfather passes.

02:23:35.958 --> 02:23:37.538
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a name for Microsoft's Rift.

02:23:37.718 --> 02:23:37.959
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:23:38.039 --> 02:23:38.559
[SPEAKER_02]: The Jacked.

02:23:39.099 --> 02:23:39.399
What?

02:23:40.019 --> 02:23:40.440
[SPEAKER_04]: Be quiet.

02:23:40.820 --> 02:23:41.120
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:42.721
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was a really good name.

02:23:43.342 --> 02:23:45.383
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're jacked into the game.

02:23:45.403 --> 02:23:51.407
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, that is so opening it up to... I'm gonna get jacked on my X-Bone, you guys.

02:23:51.427 --> 02:23:52.648
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm jacking my X-Bone.

02:23:52.668 --> 02:23:52.808
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh.

02:23:54.246 --> 02:23:56.708
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:24:19.369 --> 02:24:26.932
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say it's not worthy of the list, but I just want to be a little bit less morbid, and I'm sorry, Alan, but I'm going to take off the 8-bit, Godfather.

02:24:27.452 --> 02:24:28.853
[SPEAKER_09]: So nobody else has to.

02:24:29.333 --> 02:24:35.535
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of thought that was going to go... To be fair, we brought... Even though it's probably going to happen.

02:24:35.935 --> 02:24:37.276
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought it on ourselves.

02:24:37.916 --> 02:24:40.537
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it was going to be dark, and we made him do it.

02:24:40.997 --> 02:24:42.598
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly think it's going to happen.

02:24:42.618 --> 02:24:44.899
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to take it off.

02:24:44.939 --> 02:24:48.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is stricken from the list, so we don't have to talk about it anymore.

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:50.961
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're up next.

02:24:51.001 --> 02:24:55.323
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you can see the board there over at live.vognetwork.com, but which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:24:56.204 --> 02:24:58.505
[SPEAKER_12]: Only because it doesn't really make any sense to me.

02:24:58.705 --> 02:25:00.285
[SPEAKER_12]: It just seems very uninteresting.

02:25:00.386 --> 02:25:04.127
[SPEAKER_12]: New Mass Effect Screenshot causes shipping war.

02:25:04.267 --> 02:25:04.848
[SPEAKER_04]: New Mass Effect.

02:25:05.088 --> 02:25:08.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, of course that's going to happen.

02:25:08.770 --> 02:25:09.430
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not wrong.

02:25:10.916 --> 02:25:28.102
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm not wrong that's a guarantee it's too safe a prediction and we're too edgy here at OLR for that so it is stricken from the list alright, fair enough Jason, it's a tough job but that's what we do here at OLR which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:25:28.682 --> 02:25:31.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Oculus only has one C by the way that's okay

02:25:31.465 --> 02:25:33.626
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you strike something from the list?

02:25:33.646 --> 02:25:34.447
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to strike that?

02:25:34.487 --> 02:25:35.828
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm striking a letter from the list.

02:25:35.848 --> 02:25:36.648
[SPEAKER_04]: You're striking a letter.

02:25:36.688 --> 02:25:36.988
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:25:37.028 --> 02:25:39.010
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been stricken from the list.

02:25:39.090 --> 02:25:39.610
[SPEAKER_02]: My goodness.

02:25:39.890 --> 02:25:41.391
[SPEAKER_04]: That letter has been stricken from the list.

02:25:41.751 --> 02:25:42.071
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

02:25:42.211 --> 02:25:43.612
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two very, very good ones.

02:25:43.913 --> 02:25:46.494
[SPEAKER_02]: And which one do I think is less likely of the two?

02:25:47.935 --> 02:25:51.037
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to toss out 3DS games on the Wii U.

02:25:51.986 --> 02:25:59.595
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 3DS games on the Wii U. You're going to stick with Alan's more morbid prediction that it's just the regular DS and it disappoints.

02:25:59.695 --> 02:26:08.866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think either one of them because the 3DS plays DS titles, but definitely not 3DS games on the Wii U, unfortunately.

02:26:09.406 --> 02:26:09.846
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love it.

02:26:09.866 --> 02:26:10.567
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't gonna happen.

02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:34.262
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, again, just like the Mass Effect thing, that's too safe of a prediction.

02:26:34.322 --> 02:26:37.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the Wii U price is going to drop, and I don't think Mario Kart 8 will fail.

02:26:37.644 --> 02:26:40.366
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll be the second biggest game on the console next to Mario 3D World.

02:26:40.646 --> 02:26:43.587
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry, Loki, but it is stricken from the list.

02:26:43.607 --> 02:26:49.791
[SPEAKER_04]: But that does mean Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 coming out, that gets immunity, and Alan may not remove it from the list.

02:26:50.191 --> 02:26:53.553
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:26:54.694 --> 02:26:59.837
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a panicked engineer with a crowbar in his hand, Half-Life 3 won't get released, is

02:27:02.151 --> 02:27:04.613
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not allowing that to happen.

02:27:04.673 --> 02:27:04.993
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:27:05.133 --> 02:27:05.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

02:27:06.615 --> 02:27:07.455
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jason.

02:27:07.515 --> 02:27:09.697
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, too safe, Jason.

02:27:09.717 --> 02:27:11.839
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

02:27:12.439 --> 02:27:12.799
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:14.681
[SPEAKER_04]: It is stricken from the list.

02:27:15.061 --> 02:27:15.902
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is, guys.

02:27:15.922 --> 02:27:17.163
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a very tough process.

02:27:17.203 --> 02:27:18.063
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like pulling teeth.

02:27:18.364 --> 02:27:19.184
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we go.

02:27:19.665 --> 02:27:21.286
[SPEAKER_04]: The answers you have left to vote for.

02:27:21.686 --> 02:27:24.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

02:27:24.668 --> 02:27:26.430
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW loses a million subs over the year.

02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:28.051
[SPEAKER_04]: Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.

02:27:28.391 --> 02:27:53.011
[SPEAKER_04]: Indie Game goes from Indie to AAA in the scope of a year Oculus Rift released at 4K resolution Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party Microsoft jacks the Rift Ouya goes under Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints Those are some hefty choices, you guys, but you can vote now Now, some of you might be thinking, oh, all of those are going to come true

02:27:53.351 --> 02:27:56.054
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're going to click on your number one and your number two.

02:27:56.114 --> 02:28:00.418
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, the first one you click is your number one, and the second one you click is your number two.

02:28:00.498 --> 02:28:04.021
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the ones you like the best of those answers that are up on the board.

02:28:04.082 --> 02:28:05.323
[SPEAKER_04]: So have at it.

02:28:05.663 --> 02:28:10.708
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now live, and you can vote for the next few minutes there at live.vognetwork.com.

02:28:10.768 --> 02:28:12.810
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a live poll, and you may now vote.

02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:17.074
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will tally up those answers and read the answers here in just a little bit.

02:28:18.355 --> 02:28:18.716
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:28:19.216 --> 02:28:20.116
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

02:28:20.317 --> 02:28:20.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

02:28:21.678 --> 02:28:22.898
[SPEAKER_04]: A little morbid, but that's all right.

02:28:22.918 --> 02:28:26.241
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we cleaned up the list pretty good there at the end, so it's a little less morbid.

02:28:27.281 --> 02:28:31.924
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a few more stories for you guys, though, before we get to the answers and the FUs of the week and all that good stuff.

02:28:31.984 --> 02:28:33.926
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

02:28:34.706 --> 02:28:36.187
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alan, by the way, for participating.

02:28:36.207 --> 02:28:37.248
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let you know if one of yours wins.

02:28:37.268 --> 02:28:38.469
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:28:38.669 --> 02:28:46.094
[SPEAKER_12]: So, hey, just in case you wanted to check it out, there's another Telltale series that's free to try.

02:28:46.134 --> 02:28:47.815
[SPEAKER_12]: At least they have the first episode.

02:28:48.288 --> 02:28:49.908
[SPEAKER_12]: for free right now, The Wolf Among Us.

02:28:50.689 --> 02:28:53.750
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can get that free on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:28:54.090 --> 02:28:57.451
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not sure how long that's supposed to be free for, so better act fast.

02:28:57.631 --> 02:29:00.471
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're also doing discounts for some other stuff for the end of the year.

02:29:00.491 --> 02:29:04.293
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been marking down stuff, I think, all the way up through New Year's.

02:29:04.353 --> 02:29:05.873
[SPEAKER_12]: So go check it out.

02:29:08.231 --> 02:29:10.332
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot of really good things about this game.

02:29:10.352 --> 02:29:11.333
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another one of those.

02:29:11.413 --> 02:29:13.694
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have played it in 2013, but oops, I didn't.

02:29:14.915 --> 02:29:16.276
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, I'm very curious.

02:29:16.296 --> 02:29:16.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Check this out.

02:29:16.816 --> 02:29:21.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, before you run away, Alan, don't you read, you read a lot of these graphic novels and stuff.

02:29:21.139 --> 02:29:24.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you familiar with this, this Fables that the Telltale one's based off of?

02:29:25.655 --> 02:29:29.138
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the first three volumes in the office, so yeah.

02:29:29.158 --> 02:29:30.199
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to check this out?

02:29:30.219 --> 02:29:31.079
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you curious about this game?

02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:38.024
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on what spoilers it has for the comics, because I'm only on volume three of the trade paperback, and they're like on, what, volume 30?

02:29:39.305 --> 02:29:41.787
[SPEAKER_11]: So I checked it out like four years ago and haven't touched it since.

02:29:42.568 --> 02:29:42.848
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

02:29:43.028 --> 02:29:43.408
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

02:29:44.329 --> 02:29:46.731
[SPEAKER_12]: You can still mark it for download, you know, just in case.

02:29:49.534 --> 02:30:01.764
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, you know, as most Telltale games, if you wait a little longer, it'll probably be like five bucks for the whole thing at some point, but at the same time, I've been hearing great things about it, so I don't know how much longer we can wait, so we'll check that out soon.

02:30:02.485 --> 02:30:03.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Jason, what do you got for us?

02:30:05.331 --> 02:30:07.373
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple months ago, the Mighty No.

02:30:07.653 --> 02:30:12.097
[SPEAKER_02]: 9 gang held a vote to determine the design of Beck's Helper Call.

02:30:12.497 --> 02:30:15.720
[SPEAKER_02]: Those votes have been counted and design number F!

02:30:17.081 --> 02:30:17.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a bow.

02:30:17.781 --> 02:30:23.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a virtual radio bow for everybody but the YouTube listeners because I can drive that point home.

02:30:24.826 --> 02:30:28.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Design F only won by less than 3%.

02:30:28.487 --> 02:30:30.028
[SPEAKER_02]: Design H came in third.

02:30:30.168 --> 02:30:33.189
[SPEAKER_02]: And Design E was the close rejection.

02:30:33.249 --> 02:30:38.190
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to see what... I should be able to go see the vote and see what Design E is.

02:30:38.210 --> 02:30:42.572
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really, really dig Design F. Very, very, you know...

02:30:43.812 --> 02:30:52.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden blonde hair, predominantly red, kind of lollipop striping, very appropriate, but really a good design.

02:30:52.659 --> 02:30:57.442
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, design F, that's E, this will probably take me a minute.

02:30:57.522 --> 02:31:03.066
[SPEAKER_02]: So we finally have the primary two protagonists in Mighty No.

02:31:03.086 --> 02:31:07.870
[SPEAKER_02]: 9, Beck and Call, and what each of them look like, their relevant primary color scheme, and so forth.

02:31:08.939 --> 02:31:13.221
[SPEAKER_04]: She kind of looks like one of those cinnamon candy canes to me with the pink and red striping.

02:31:13.241 --> 02:31:22.225
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know this is a radio show, so I can't really show you the pictures, but just imagine the whole Mega Man style, which obviously they're changing just ever so slightly for this Mighty No.

02:31:22.405 --> 02:31:25.446
[SPEAKER_04]: 9, but she's more of one of those cinnamon candy canes with big blonde hair.

02:31:25.586 --> 02:31:25.867
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:31:25.907 --> 02:31:28.828
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he was pretty good, too, taking a look at that.

02:31:29.128 --> 02:31:30.969
[SPEAKER_12]: They have the designs.

02:31:30.989 --> 02:31:34.450
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go to the second page of the Kickstarter, there's a link on the article there.

02:31:34.930 --> 02:31:36.051
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows the different designs.

02:31:36.807 --> 02:31:41.631
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like she's going to get something with her ears, like helicopter ears or something, so that'll be cute.

02:31:41.731 --> 02:31:44.193
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are, oh jeez, what are those called?

02:31:46.295 --> 02:31:52.700
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically like hair, I want to say a hair tie, but that's completely incorrect.

02:31:53.481 --> 02:31:57.064
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hair tie in a bow, basically, is what's going on there.

02:31:58.165 --> 02:32:15.776
[SPEAKER_02]: And suddenly my chat is not working anymore, so I can't paste this in chat No, they got it, and Pochikawa put it in there too It completely stopped updating for me, so I can't even see it Because tonight is my night of puns, should I read the puntastic quote at the bottom of this article?

02:32:16.637 --> 02:32:23.742
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure Some of you may have just met Design F, and think it's crazy But she's got the numbers, so she's call now, baby

02:32:27.728 --> 02:32:29.329
[SPEAKER_04]: That is definitely going to do it for the news for 2013.

02:32:29.569 --> 02:32:34.692
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the last news article we are reading this year.

02:32:35.233 --> 02:32:36.253
[SPEAKER_04]: No Mighty No.

02:32:36.273 --> 02:32:38.395
[SPEAKER_04]: 9 in our 2014 predictions, but I am very much looking forward to it.

02:32:38.595 --> 02:32:39.895
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's because it'll happen.

02:32:39.915 --> 02:32:40.596
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be amazing.

02:32:40.896 --> 02:32:42.197
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been a very safe prediction.

02:32:42.637 --> 02:32:45.999
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they said it's going to come out in 2014 when the Kickstarter whole thing happened.

02:32:47.080 --> 02:32:48.361
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, was it supposed to be 2015?

02:32:48.421 --> 02:32:48.921
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it was 2014.

02:32:49.201 --> 02:32:49.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

02:32:51.835 --> 02:32:52.015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:25.821
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, it is about that time.

02:33:25.861 --> 02:33:32.623
[SPEAKER_04]: We're almost to the part of the show where we're going to take calls, but first we want to hear from our listeners in a segment we call the Mailbag.

02:33:33.764 --> 02:33:42.867
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangelaundry.com and DarkSakura dives into the Mailbag headfirst and finds a few emails that she thinks, oh, this is worth looking at.

02:33:43.607 --> 02:33:44.607
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about this tonight.

02:33:44.707 --> 02:33:45.628
[SPEAKER_09]: I like D-Best.

02:33:45.908 --> 02:33:46.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're looking at the...

02:33:47.748 --> 02:33:49.488
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think I really like Dee best.

02:33:50.369 --> 02:33:50.669
[SPEAKER_02]: Why's that?

02:33:50.689 --> 02:33:54.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Dee is like gothic, goth Lolita kind of someone like that.

02:33:54.589 --> 02:33:55.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

02:33:55.310 --> 02:33:56.910
[SPEAKER_09]: She's kind of dark and badass.

02:33:57.890 --> 02:34:01.371
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like Bee too because it sort of gives me that Dr. Slump vibe.

02:34:01.511 --> 02:34:02.171
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag.

02:34:02.191 --> 02:34:06.932
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I know you're reading a lot of letters, but there's some letters in our mailbag as well.

02:34:06.952 --> 02:34:08.912
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're complaining about me tonight!

02:34:09.312 --> 02:34:09.932
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow!

02:34:11.293 --> 02:34:11.673
Wow!

02:34:14.375 --> 02:34:27.886
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a thought such as it is, I presume the YouTube content ID issue won't come to a head when a major partner channel such as Tabuscus and Epic Mealtime and Vsauce gets taken down for content claims.

02:34:28.327 --> 02:34:36.474
[SPEAKER_09]: Rather, it'll happen when Disney, say, issues a claim or has a claim issued on their behalf against content from one of Viacom's own channels or vice versa.

02:34:38.094 --> 02:34:41.055
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I'm disappointed that the Mac version of the Stanley Parable requires 10.8.

02:34:41.656 --> 02:34:46.938
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hesitant to upgrade my OS on my 2009 laptop to even 10.7.

02:34:47.818 --> 02:35:01.963
[SPEAKER_09]: Much less seriously and too wordy from what I understand of the plot of Assassin's Creed 4, I'd like to see them have taken as much historic liberties with their chanteys as with the music of Bioshock Infinity.

02:35:02.683 --> 02:35:14.661
[SPEAKER_09]: Ideally take inspiration from dinosaur comics and sing pop songs with babies substituted with matey Everyone's trying to be me matey, matey I love your way, matey done a bad bad thing and so on That comes from Robert M

02:35:16.673 --> 02:35:37.181
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the YouTube thing I'm full of it tonight Epic Mealtime is never going to have a content ID against them Because all of their stuff is 100% original Here's something else to consider As much as that's how we all want to see it go down You all know YouTube has a secret whitelist That nobody talks about The people that are on the whitelist aren't talking about it But that's why Viacom's not going to have a copyright claim Against them ever

02:35:37.421 --> 02:35:38.181
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on the whitelist.

02:35:38.261 --> 02:35:46.965
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what some of the outrage was, is because some of these people that we would have presumed were on it, affiliates notably, were starting to get screwed by this.

02:35:48.506 --> 02:35:57.469
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Epic Mealtime, Epic Mealtime primary channel will not, but their spinoff, Original Gamer, assuming that's even still a thing, I actually haven't watched it in quite a couple of weeks now.

02:35:58.069 --> 02:36:03.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Original Gamer stands the biggest threat because of their non-original content, non-original video.

02:36:05.632 --> 02:36:10.756
[SPEAKER_02]: but it remains to be seen what changes do and don't happen as a result of the last couple of weeks of Fallout.

02:36:13.198 --> 02:36:13.678
[SPEAKER_09]: Next email.

02:36:13.878 --> 02:36:14.059
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:16.140
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, OLR.

02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:17.361
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:36:17.641 --> 02:36:18.782
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there a name on that last email?

02:36:18.802 --> 02:36:20.884
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Robert M. Oh, I missed that somehow.

02:36:21.744 --> 02:36:23.085
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to share a quick story.

02:36:23.265 --> 02:36:28.187
[SPEAKER_09]: I just finished rebuilding my DDR pad for this winter and have been jamming about four times a week.

02:36:28.268 --> 02:36:31.869
[SPEAKER_09]: My legs have never hurt so bad and I'm a hardcore road cyclist.

02:36:32.470 --> 02:36:33.490
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a different kind of impact.

02:36:34.191 --> 02:36:39.834
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, last night I finished on a heavy nine step that is lightning steps for half the song.

02:36:40.214 --> 02:36:43.636
[SPEAKER_09]: My legs were jello so I walked downstairs and completely pulled my left quad.

02:36:44.216 --> 02:36:45.317
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I can barely walk.

02:36:45.417 --> 02:36:50.740
[SPEAKER_09]: When people ask what happened I get a hazy look in my eye and tell them that I pulled a muscle dance into a video game.

02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:52.401
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the typical response?

02:36:52.822 --> 02:36:54.082
[SPEAKER_09]: They smile politely and walk away.

02:36:54.363 --> 02:36:55.924
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know what to say.

02:36:56.024 --> 02:36:56.544
[SPEAKER_04]: How awkward.

02:36:56.984 --> 02:36:58.065
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to tell you.

02:36:59.617 --> 02:37:05.341
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give you a little bit of advice a trainer gave me, but by no means am I a trainer slash doctor, whatever.

02:37:06.281 --> 02:37:13.025
[SPEAKER_09]: When you are done playing DDR, don't walk downstairs, don't walk upstairs, don't do anything more strenuous.

02:37:13.425 --> 02:37:15.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Walk slowly and stretch.

02:37:16.247 --> 02:37:20.570
[SPEAKER_09]: Stretch while your muscles are warm, and usually you'll avoid cramps.

02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:22.931
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just my experience, but again, I'm not a professional.

02:37:23.731 --> 02:37:25.653
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a generally accepted thing out there, too.

02:37:25.713 --> 02:37:27.754
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you always stretch before you play.

02:37:27.774 --> 02:37:28.094
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

02:37:28.114 --> 02:37:28.935
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't stretch before you play.

02:37:29.155 --> 02:37:29.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

02:37:29.335 --> 02:37:30.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Stretch after you warm up.

02:37:30.956 --> 02:37:31.236
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:37:31.316 --> 02:37:34.758
[SPEAKER_09]: If you stretch a muscle when it has not warmed up, you can do more damage to it.

02:37:35.404 --> 02:37:36.105
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

02:37:56.022 --> 02:37:57.763
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I getting old or am I just overdoing it?

02:37:57.863 --> 02:38:01.985
[SPEAKER_09]: As a 34-year-old, this is my main form of exercise during the non-cycling months.

02:38:02.586 --> 02:38:05.567
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure you guys have had DDR injuries, right?

02:38:06.328 --> 02:38:09.189
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, you remember the issue I had with... It's been a long time, but yeah.

02:38:09.369 --> 02:38:11.090
[SPEAKER_09]: I did fall and hit my head on the machine once.

02:38:12.031 --> 02:38:20.075
[SPEAKER_09]: But you remember those shoes that I had that I couldn't do jumping moves because the arch support in my shoes sent pain up my feet.

02:38:21.636 --> 02:38:37.294
[SPEAKER_09]: and so I would come off of the machine with shooting pain going up both of my legs coming directly from my arches because I already have pretty hefty arches in my feet I don't have flat feet I have the opposite problem I have really high arches in my feet

02:38:38.054 --> 02:38:49.542
[SPEAKER_09]: and when I changed from using arch support shoes to using either flats like Converse All Stars or the Airwalk equivalent and my Vibrams, that all went away.

02:38:50.502 --> 02:38:57.046
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was my biggest injury with DDR but I can tell you that I had pulled a...

02:38:58.067 --> 02:38:58.627
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura

02:39:28.326 --> 02:39:29.987
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a few people in chat room, by the way.

02:39:30.047 --> 02:39:34.628
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft said, I twisted my ankle playing DDR twice, once on a Cobalt Flux pad.

02:39:34.649 --> 02:39:35.489
[SPEAKER_09]: It was rather painful.

02:39:39.730 --> 02:39:41.451
[SPEAKER_09]: So, to continue this email, it's almost done.

02:39:41.711 --> 02:39:44.052
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, I got Surgeon Simulator on Steam sale today.

02:39:44.252 --> 02:39:46.133
[SPEAKER_09]: Good grief, it's impossible, but hilarious.

02:39:46.933 --> 02:39:48.914
[SPEAKER_09]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.

02:39:49.834 --> 02:39:51.895
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fun game, and yes, it is impossible.

02:39:52.575 --> 02:39:53.856
[SPEAKER_09]: The space one is hilarious.

02:39:55.103 --> 02:39:56.084
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so last email.

02:39:56.744 --> 02:39:59.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

02:39:59.066 --> 02:40:02.128
[SPEAKER_09]: You get the last email of the year.

02:40:02.168 --> 02:40:03.509
[SPEAKER_09]: You win air.

02:40:03.609 --> 02:40:04.109
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a deep breath.

02:40:05.290 --> 02:40:09.673
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to chime in with a few thoughts I had on PAX's diversity lounge idea.

02:40:10.333 --> 02:40:20.180
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like that by labeling a room as a place to learn about diversity in gaming culture is making it seem like it will be the only room where PAX minorities can feel safe and at ease.

02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:25.924
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a hard sell to make a room shoved into a corner feel like you're being, quote, inclusive to people.

02:40:26.684 --> 02:40:35.050
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wanted to bring your guys' attention to the Awesome Games Done Quick Charity Marathon, which you guys mentioned last year on your show.

02:40:35.610 --> 02:40:40.873
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys talked about it after the marathon was over, so I wanted to make sure all the listeners knew about the marathon before it starts.

02:40:41.314 --> 02:40:50.360
[SPEAKER_09]: It runs from Sunday, January 5th through the 11th and will feature some of the best speed gamers from around the world playing games fast to raise money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:41:10.270
[SPEAKER_09]: I got really into speedrunning after watching last year's marathon and started learning tricks for some classic games like Super Mario 64 that would be the wall jump and Ocarina of Time learning each new trick helps drive your time down and it's kind of addicting side note my best times on the games are 22 minutes for Super Mario 64 and 25 minutes for Ocarina of Time

02:41:11.491 --> 02:41:15.615
[SPEAKER_09]: There are bidding wars and prize raffles throughout the marathon as well.

02:41:16.016 --> 02:41:27.749
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to donate money to a good cause, have the chance to win prizes, and watch people completely wreck games that you love in ways you never thought possible, make sure to watch and just search Awesome Games Done Quick and it will be the first link.

02:41:28.570 --> 02:41:29.611
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for reading my email.

02:41:29.651 --> 02:41:32.693
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope you all had a happy holiday and have a happy new year AZHP.

02:41:33.554 --> 02:41:33.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:41:34.215 --> 02:41:35.836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you for reminding me of the charity event.

02:41:35.876 --> 02:41:37.437
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Flaco Jones is a big fan of this too.

02:41:37.697 --> 02:41:40.419
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an ex-Furl in a hoard house, watches a lot of this too.

02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:45.043
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, these guys are very popular and it's for good reason.

02:41:45.103 --> 02:41:46.945
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that speedrun stuff can be addicting.

02:41:47.085 --> 02:41:49.907
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm terrible at it, but it's sure fun to think about it.

02:41:50.087 --> 02:41:57.493
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people are just like the level of detail that they understand a game's engine is phenomenal to me.

02:41:58.140 --> 02:42:00.261
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I used to be able to do that when I was a kid.

02:42:03.702 --> 02:42:13.464
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I was watching, there's a buddy of mine that grew up in New Mexico that recently moved out to Maine, and I've been watching a lot of the stuff he's been playing.

02:42:14.725 --> 02:42:16.925
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows, like, Spyro...

02:42:19.166 --> 02:42:28.295
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if it's two or three, but he knows Spyro glitches, like the back of his hand, and he's getting really, really good at getting them reproducible.

02:42:29.556 --> 02:42:33.679
[SPEAKER_02]: He's speedrunning Shattered Memories, even though I don't think there's really...

02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:45.088
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any glitches in it, he just finds the best path and skips through the sequences and cutscenes, the doctor sequences as much as possible, as quick as possible, that kind of stuff.

02:42:45.968 --> 02:42:49.411
[SPEAKER_02]: And that speedrun is literally just learning the best path of the game.

02:42:50.229 --> 02:43:14.633
[SPEAKER_02]: I revisited some of those awesome games on quick videos from the summer and somebody was speedrunning Super Meat Boy just Light World Clear, I don't think he did Dark Worlds but they also got Team Meat in on Skype and the programmers of the game they were shocked that they had never heard of some of these bugs before

02:43:16.321 --> 02:43:40.616
[SPEAKER_02]: whether they went and fixed them after the fact or figured out why they're happening I have no idea but just the level of dedication that whether they stumble across it randomly or with skill completely phenomenal and everything about that production is so fantastic great charity, great video, great skill I didn't know they do it twice a year so I'm definitely looking forward to being able to watch that in a week or two

02:43:41.089 --> 02:43:48.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know Dan and I actually tried for like an hour each trying to learn the wall jump in Super Mario 64 so that we could get up to the roof and beat the game?

02:43:48.594 --> 02:43:50.636
[SPEAKER_02]: I had heard of that.

02:43:50.716 --> 02:43:51.837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I ever tried.

02:43:51.977 --> 02:43:55.279
[SPEAKER_09]: There's videos up and apparently it's supposed to work in the DS version as well.

02:43:56.380 --> 02:44:00.763
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the precision to play that on Mario 64 DS.

02:44:03.118 --> 02:44:05.121
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that is it for the mailbag.

02:44:05.901 --> 02:44:06.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed, that is it.

02:44:06.923 --> 02:44:10.747
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also your very last chance to vote in tonight's list list.

02:44:11.167 --> 02:44:12.849
[SPEAKER_04]: You're already slacking if you waited this long.

02:44:12.889 --> 02:44:13.830
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your last chance.

02:44:14.912 --> 02:44:22.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.VogNetwork.com and we will read the answers here shortly, but first we have the FUs of the week.

02:44:23.441 --> 02:44:23.762
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:44:40.595 --> 02:44:46.447
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to Pinkberry for having peppermint and chocolate because it was so good and I want more.

02:44:46.888 --> 02:44:48.911
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've had wine tonight, so no Pinkberry.

02:44:49.952 --> 02:44:50.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Wine's really good.

02:44:50.573 --> 02:44:52.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need any wine flavor for your berry?

02:44:53.015 --> 02:44:53.315
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

02:44:53.515 --> 02:44:54.556
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, though?

02:44:54.856 --> 02:44:56.798
[SPEAKER_09]: They had in Japan last year, Rob.

02:44:57.238 --> 02:44:59.820
[SPEAKER_09]: They had muscat grape Kit Kats.

02:45:00.741 --> 02:45:02.983
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were amazing.

02:45:03.003 --> 02:45:03.483
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet.

02:45:04.024 --> 02:45:07.627
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend who lives in Nagoya sent... You remember my friend Julie, right?

02:45:08.147 --> 02:45:08.327
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:45:08.347 --> 02:45:09.068
[SPEAKER_09]: And our friend Krista.

02:45:09.468 --> 02:45:10.309
[SPEAKER_09]: Krista lives in Nagoya.

02:45:10.469 --> 02:45:10.729
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.

02:45:10.889 --> 02:45:15.193
[SPEAKER_09]: She sent Julie a bunch of muscat Kit Kats, and we went through the whole box.

02:45:16.474 --> 02:45:17.415
[SPEAKER_09]: They're amazing, so...

02:45:19.235 --> 02:45:21.017
[SPEAKER_09]: Pinkberry, get Muscat flavor.

02:45:21.658 --> 02:45:21.958
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it.

02:45:23.219 --> 02:45:25.222
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, you have some FUs of the week?

02:45:27.044 --> 02:45:30.167
[SPEAKER_12]: FU to my cat who thinks I'm a pillow or something.

02:45:31.068 --> 02:45:34.111
[SPEAKER_12]: He's literally an inch away from the microphone.

02:45:34.652 --> 02:45:37.075
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, do you have any FUs?

02:45:41.081 --> 02:45:47.168
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nothing against alcohol, but F you to excuses to get smashed at 11 in the morning.

02:45:47.828 --> 02:45:48.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's a bit much.

02:45:48.850 --> 02:45:49.731
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they do to people.

02:45:50.589 --> 02:45:53.031
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you're not going to dog our wine drinking, are you?

02:45:53.051 --> 02:45:54.592
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely not.

02:45:54.993 --> 02:45:55.973
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to be responsible.

02:45:56.094 --> 02:45:57.515
[SPEAKER_04]: We always advocate responsibility as well.

02:45:58.515 --> 02:46:04.480
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to FU to the scare that Alan might be getting sick again and therefore I might be getting sick again.

02:46:04.580 --> 02:46:05.221
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just sick.

02:46:05.741 --> 02:46:06.662
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be sick again.

02:46:06.762 --> 02:46:10.966
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you should be more concerned for Alan being healthy so Alan can be healthy.

02:46:11.166 --> 02:46:12.347
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I want to be healthy.

02:46:14.381 --> 02:46:14.981
[SPEAKER_09]: So rude.

02:46:15.001 --> 02:46:15.761
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, it would be nice.

02:46:15.821 --> 02:46:17.002
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, do you hear this fuckery?

02:46:18.162 --> 02:46:20.003
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it would be nice if Alan was healthy too.

02:46:21.103 --> 02:46:21.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is.

02:46:22.023 --> 02:46:23.724
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it for the FUs of the week.

02:46:23.744 --> 02:46:25.244
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you laughing about over there?

02:46:26.244 --> 02:46:26.684
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

02:46:26.704 --> 02:46:27.605
[SPEAKER_04]: You trying to start some shit?

02:46:27.625 --> 02:46:28.725
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're trying to do over there.

02:46:28.785 --> 02:46:29.345
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

02:46:29.445 --> 02:46:29.785
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:46:30.065 --> 02:46:30.885
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

02:46:31.346 --> 02:46:32.766
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want Pinkberry right now.

02:46:32.926 --> 02:46:33.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you do.

02:46:33.966 --> 02:46:35.087
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want to get sick either.

02:46:36.827 --> 02:46:38.529
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that is it.

02:46:38.669 --> 02:46:44.935
[SPEAKER_04]: We are done-zo with the question tonight from the listless question there.

02:46:44.955 --> 02:46:49.579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just waiting for the answers to load in there and we can tell you what the top answers were.

02:46:49.619 --> 02:46:50.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, the definitive list.

02:46:51.801 --> 02:46:54.183
[SPEAKER_04]: Our predictions for 2014.

02:46:54.243 --> 02:46:54.703
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:46:54.763 --> 02:46:57.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Your number three answer.

02:46:57.605 --> 02:46:58.285
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's Alan?

02:46:58.585 --> 02:46:58.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan?

02:46:58.965 --> 02:46:59.366
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.

02:47:00.086 --> 02:47:00.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three answer.

02:47:00.987 --> 02:47:04.549
[SPEAKER_04]: Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA.

02:47:04.629 --> 02:47:05.009
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

02:47:05.029 --> 02:47:05.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

02:47:05.749 --> 02:47:06.210
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the winner.

02:47:06.470 --> 02:47:06.930
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

02:47:07.230 --> 02:47:07.751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:08.191
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:47:08.471 --> 02:47:09.752
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't mean what I said earlier.

02:47:12.013 --> 02:47:13.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, don't cough on my mic.

02:47:13.734 --> 02:47:16.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, the number two answer.

02:47:16.214 --> 02:47:17.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, number two answer.

02:47:18.175 --> 02:47:22.916
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

02:47:24.877 --> 02:47:31.579
[SPEAKER_04]: And the number one answer, the thing that absolutely has to happen in 2014 as voted on by the listeners.

02:47:32.579 --> 02:47:36.742
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank God a shiny happy answer won after the dark places we went to tonight.

02:47:37.283 --> 02:47:41.185
[SPEAKER_04]: Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

02:47:41.245 --> 02:47:41.846
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

02:47:41.866 --> 02:47:42.406
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

02:47:42.786 --> 02:47:43.467
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

02:47:43.947 --> 02:47:46.349
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all nice people after all.

02:47:46.389 --> 02:47:46.789
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes.

02:47:46.829 --> 02:47:47.330
[SPEAKER_02]: Wink, wink.

02:47:47.370 --> 02:47:47.670
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually.

02:47:48.350 --> 02:47:48.871
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

02:47:49.331 --> 02:47:49.992
[SPEAKER_04]: The definitive list.

02:47:50.032 --> 02:47:57.057
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that is Fallout 4 confirmed, F-Zero Boner Party, and Innovation leading to advances for the disabled.

02:47:57.097 --> 02:47:57.457
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

02:47:57.497 --> 02:47:59.619
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for participating in Listless tonight.

02:47:59.939 --> 02:48:00.640
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope to do that again.

02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:06.244
[SPEAKER_04]: We have gone too long since the last time we played that game, so we will have to do that again very soon.

02:48:06.684 --> 02:48:07.185
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

02:48:07.385 --> 02:48:10.729
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it for the mailbag, the stories.

02:48:11.270 --> 02:48:20.382
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now ready for your calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:20.502 --> 02:48:22.285
[SPEAKER_04]: It is that time to give us a call.

02:48:22.605 --> 02:48:23.046
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going to...

02:48:24.247 --> 02:48:25.547
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to apologize in advance.

02:48:25.587 --> 02:48:28.128
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing something a little different with the Skype line tonight.

02:48:28.548 --> 02:48:31.609
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm getting to test this live on air as we're going.

02:48:32.549 --> 02:48:33.830
[SPEAKER_04]: So please bear with us.

02:48:34.470 --> 02:48:37.231
[SPEAKER_04]: But with this setup, we do not have to say goodbye to Loki.

02:48:37.271 --> 02:48:39.691
[SPEAKER_04]: He can stay on the line and chat with our Skype calls.

02:48:39.711 --> 02:48:47.933
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to talk to Loki or anybody here in studio or give your own thoughts on what happened in 2013 or what you'd like to see in 2014, give us a call right now.

02:48:47.953 --> 02:48:52.175
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:52.715 --> 02:48:53.255
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word.

02:48:54.185 --> 02:48:57.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, some last minute stories, possibly, maybe.

02:48:57.326 --> 02:48:59.067
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, do you have anything for last minute stories tonight?

02:49:00.447 --> 02:49:01.587
[SPEAKER_12]: No, sadly I don't.

02:49:02.328 --> 02:49:05.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's really not a whole heck of a lot going on, is there?

02:49:05.729 --> 02:49:07.309
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me see if we have any Twitter topics.

02:49:07.329 --> 02:49:10.910
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to pull those up real quick here again while we wait for some calls.

02:49:10.930 --> 02:49:15.612
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:49:15.872 --> 02:49:17.012
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I hope it works.

02:49:17.032 --> 02:49:22.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know they have a new toll-free prefix coming up?

02:49:22.694 --> 02:49:23.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they really?

02:49:23.194 --> 02:49:23.214
[SPEAKER_02]: 844-

02:49:24.548 --> 02:49:25.909
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

02:49:25.929 --> 02:49:28.049
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just kind of going down the list of all the 800s, eight double digits.

02:49:28.330 --> 02:49:33.132
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't be surprised that they're running out of stuff or whatever.

02:49:33.152 --> 02:49:37.013
[SPEAKER_02]: Considering how dirt cheap it is for anybody to pick one up now, and it's only getting easier.

02:49:38.334 --> 02:49:43.536
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird that for that reason, it's not weird for that reason that non-phone number based systems aren't coming up.

02:49:43.556 --> 02:49:44.396
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell am I saying?

02:49:44.656 --> 02:49:47.317
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we are getting a call, so let's get to it.

02:49:47.377 --> 02:49:49.978
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to go to the phones right now and take a call.

02:49:50.479 --> 02:49:52.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:53.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:57.111
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:49:58.753 --> 02:50:02.557
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first of all, did it work?

02:50:02.697 --> 02:50:03.378
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it worked.

02:50:03.418 --> 02:50:04.339
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you just fine.

02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:07.502
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:50:07.562 --> 02:50:10.105
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was thinking about Jason's.

02:50:10.165 --> 02:50:14.009
[SPEAKER_06]: One of Jason's answers, I think it was number one on the list list.

02:50:14.611 --> 02:50:18.034
[SPEAKER_06]: The indie game going AAA development.

02:50:18.935 --> 02:50:26.081
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was thinking about the My Little Pony fighting game that got cease and desist.

02:50:26.401 --> 02:50:27.682
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you laughing, Jason?

02:50:27.702 --> 02:50:28.883
[SPEAKER_02]: You're laughing like crazy over there.

02:50:29.704 --> 02:50:31.725
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this doesn't surprise me, I guess.

02:50:33.547 --> 02:50:35.449
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course you're thinking about the My Little Pony game, right?

02:50:35.489 --> 02:50:35.969
[SPEAKER_06]: It shouldn't.

02:50:38.082 --> 02:50:45.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was thinking about that, and now they're working on their own game, their own original game.

02:50:47.164 --> 02:51:00.566
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was thinking about it and hoping that possibly it could get picked up like a big publisher or something, and get a big release.

02:51:01.706 --> 02:51:05.727
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like, well, maybe, possibly like Schoolgirls.

02:51:07.905 --> 02:51:10.406
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a small release, but then it got big.

02:51:10.906 --> 02:51:12.867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, maybe not that big, or maybe not AAA, but big, mostly.

02:51:34.133 --> 02:51:35.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fair enough, fair enough.

02:51:36.195 --> 02:51:36.515
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

02:51:36.936 --> 02:51:38.917
[SPEAKER_04]: Any gaming resolutions you have for 2014?

02:51:39.157 --> 02:51:42.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Or no, we read one of your answers during the Google answers, right?

02:51:43.361 --> 02:51:46.724
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, one of my Google, well, one of, sorry.

02:51:47.765 --> 02:51:48.486
[SPEAKER_06]: Something beeping over there?

02:51:48.506 --> 02:51:50.207
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the Power Rangers theme?

02:51:50.227 --> 02:51:50.988
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?

02:51:51.028 --> 02:51:51.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:51:52.349 --> 02:51:53.310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was my phone.

02:51:53.950 --> 02:51:54.191
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

02:51:55.171 --> 02:51:59.976
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, you already read my resolutions, and sorry again, damn it.

02:52:01.434 --> 02:52:02.995
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop texting Actdeft.

02:52:03.035 --> 02:52:04.577
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on the radio, people.

02:52:06.418 --> 02:52:07.119
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there we go.

02:52:07.259 --> 02:52:07.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:52:10.011 --> 02:52:18.357
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my gaming resolutions are mostly a new PC for gaming because my current one is good, but not that great.

02:52:19.598 --> 02:52:22.800
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly the processor is old, so I need to at least replace that.

02:52:23.861 --> 02:52:27.683
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, Matt, it was Power Rangers Ringtone.

02:52:28.144 --> 02:52:28.544
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was.

02:52:29.404 --> 02:52:29.705
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:52:29.925 --> 02:52:31.606
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, go ahead.

02:52:31.886 --> 02:52:35.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my other resolution, the HDTV is, well, my...

02:52:36.607 --> 02:52:47.994
[SPEAKER_06]: My top priority right now because I have the gaming consoles and even the PC which I have the video card has HDMI out so I can use that for gaming too.

02:52:49.855 --> 02:52:55.819
[SPEAKER_06]: Will probably happen soon since I'm pretty much saving the money for that.

02:52:56.656 --> 02:53:17.222
[SPEAKER_06]: so yeah, it's mostly what I want to do next year and of course my hundreds and hundreds of games on Steam and not to mention on Xbox I have the Xbox games that I haven't finished so I need to get on that There's too much to play but it's not exactly a bad problem to have, right?

02:53:18.302 --> 02:53:24.684
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, too much to play and so little time Alright, well ActDeftBuddy we're going to let you go to try and get some more calls but thanks so much for the call and have a great new year

02:53:25.728 --> 02:53:26.308
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, you too.

02:53:48.642 --> 02:53:51.124
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, I want to read a tweet.

02:53:51.164 --> 02:53:55.147
[SPEAKER_04]: We had something from YYR and I want to make sure I got this one because this is really funny what happened here.

02:53:55.187 --> 02:54:03.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, YYR sent us a tweet here on Twitter and it says, the number one downloadable 3DS game in Japan this year, Bike Rider DX.

02:54:04.193 --> 02:54:04.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

02:54:05.074 --> 02:54:05.735
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

02:54:06.175 --> 02:54:08.778
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $2.99 in the North American eShop.

02:54:09.179 --> 02:54:10.480
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy it, OLR.

02:54:11.121 --> 02:54:12.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and get this.

02:54:12.883 --> 02:54:14.825
[SPEAKER_04]: It was retweeted by who?

02:54:15.585 --> 02:54:16.446
[SPEAKER_04]: The makers of the game.

02:54:16.526 --> 02:54:17.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

02:54:17.427 --> 02:54:18.709
[SPEAKER_04]: Retweeted by the makers of the game.

02:54:18.849 --> 02:54:20.251
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very cool there, uh...

02:54:20.831 --> 02:54:22.353
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I guess I'll have to check that out.

02:54:22.913 --> 02:54:24.174
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about that game.

02:54:24.494 --> 02:54:25.495
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like a site bike?

02:54:25.515 --> 02:54:28.298
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's kind of what it looks like to me, just based on what little I see here.

02:54:28.338 --> 02:54:30.180
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see if there's some of the pictures here.

02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:32.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like a lot of this stuff is just retweeted.

02:54:32.582 --> 02:54:34.443
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, it doesn't actually look like a site bike at all.

02:54:35.124 --> 02:54:37.887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this more like a little 2D platformer type of thing.

02:54:37.947 --> 02:54:38.327
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cute.

02:54:38.347 --> 02:54:39.228
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cute, yeah.

02:54:39.248 --> 02:54:39.908
[SPEAKER_04]: For $2.99, I'd try it.

02:54:41.890 --> 02:54:49.178
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably a style of game not terribly unlike Trials, where more lean mechanics and physics and all that kind of stuff.

02:54:49.318 --> 02:54:50.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it might be a little more something like that.

02:54:51.020 --> 02:54:52.401
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very attractive looking game.

02:54:52.521 --> 02:54:53.723
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of this before.

02:54:54.483 --> 02:54:55.124
[SPEAKER_02]: 3DS eShop.

02:54:55.845 --> 02:54:58.788
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what purchase I'm making in the near future.

02:54:58.948 --> 02:55:06.355
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I think I might actually have enough left in my wallet now that it's shared between Wii U and 3DS because I put like $10 in the other day when I bought Castlevania and stuff.

02:55:06.375 --> 02:55:10.219
[SPEAKER_04]: So I might, which I know I don't have to do that, but whatever.

02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:14.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, 1-877-GAME-O-L-R or use name on Skype, Orange Ones Radio.

02:55:14.663 --> 02:55:17.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Last chance to call the show ever in 2013.

02:55:18.086 --> 02:55:21.469
[SPEAKER_04]: So give us a call and we'll talk.

02:55:21.570 --> 02:55:21.850
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:55:21.870 --> 02:55:23.291
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a lot of, do I have other tweets?

02:55:23.311 --> 02:55:23.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me look.

02:55:24.966 --> 02:55:25.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to other tweets.

02:55:25.746 --> 02:55:28.527
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet for a future week.

02:55:28.887 --> 02:55:30.068
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I'm going to be real honest.

02:55:30.108 --> 02:55:32.148
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to only see the stuff the day of the show.

02:55:33.369 --> 02:55:34.469
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100 Matt sent us a tweet.

02:55:35.649 --> 02:55:42.812
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine year in MVP baseball lives on through the Latin American mod community with the MVP Carby.

02:55:44.052 --> 02:55:45.972
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what this is even talking about.

02:55:46.012 --> 02:55:53.695
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Caribe because it was a... I don't know all of the backstory about this because I haven't followed a lot of baseball video gaming stuff.

02:55:53.815 --> 02:55:53.975
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

02:55:55.236 --> 02:56:20.974
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically along the lines of a classic MVP baseball game Totally modded for newer rosters I remember this game, that's right, and it's been long gone So it's been gone for 10 years, this MVP baseball Because a licensing deal fell through for them 10 years ago But things live on thanks to this remake, essentially, that's on the PC Which is a celebration of Latin American baseball That's pretty cool

02:56:22.375 --> 02:56:23.296
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now I get it.

02:56:23.416 --> 02:56:25.977
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard of this game before, and you can check that out.

02:56:25.997 --> 02:56:31.441
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you like your baseball, Latin American baseball, you can check that out.

02:56:33.021 --> 02:56:39.025
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, trying to find some other tweets here over at twitter.com slash OLR.

02:56:40.326 --> 02:56:46.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamit Hunts tweeted us earlier this week, or actually it was just yesterday, saying, Oh God, Sky, OLR.

02:56:47.270 --> 02:56:49.433
[SPEAKER_04]: I got started on Tiny Death Star this week.

02:56:50.114 --> 02:56:53.539
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, yes, I know I'm a bit behind on shows.

02:56:53.679 --> 02:56:55.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody can listen the week of the show.

02:56:56.262 --> 02:57:00.868
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was just going to say, I finally quit Tiny Death Star just before they put in the holiday stuff.

02:57:00.928 --> 02:57:03.011
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad I got you hooked on a game that I quit.

02:57:04.273 --> 02:57:05.554
[SPEAKER_07]: Play the Doctor Who game instead.

02:57:06.415 --> 02:57:06.996
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, Brad.

02:57:07.076 --> 02:57:08.577
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad was telling me about that game.

02:57:08.637 --> 02:57:09.238
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty fun.

02:57:09.298 --> 02:57:09.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

02:57:10.119 --> 02:57:11.000
[SPEAKER_07]: How much is it on iOS?

02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:12.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Free.

02:57:12.862 --> 02:57:13.803
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

02:57:13.823 --> 02:57:14.403
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

02:57:14.503 --> 02:57:19.949
[SPEAKER_09]: It has the stupid transaction thing again, but you don't need any of them.

02:57:20.049 --> 02:57:21.250
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't ever used any.

02:57:21.290 --> 02:57:22.492
[SPEAKER_09]: And they give you freebies all the time.

02:57:24.393 --> 02:57:36.998
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've just I've been replaying levels actually to unlock characters until I got the Sontaran Butler and I always forget that guy's name but like I have River Song now I'm very happy

02:57:39.062 --> 02:57:39.383
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:57:39.903 --> 02:57:42.486
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give one more shout-out for the Skype line and see if we get anybody.

02:57:42.526 --> 02:57:42.966
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.

02:57:43.026 --> 02:57:46.249
[SPEAKER_04]: No, everybody's shy here on the last night of the year.

02:57:46.269 --> 02:57:48.091
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:57:48.891 --> 02:57:54.376
[SPEAKER_04]: I was worried that the setup didn't work because I have things run differently tonight, but Actdeft got through, so I know it works.

02:57:54.957 --> 02:57:57.319
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that they're being reflective on the year.

02:57:58.299 --> 02:58:00.380
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they just being quiet and pensive on the year?

02:58:01.181 --> 02:58:01.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps?

02:58:01.861 --> 02:58:02.401
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

02:58:02.822 --> 02:58:05.603
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of Doctor Who games that all have subtitles.

02:58:05.623 --> 02:58:08.024
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what the subtitle for this particular one is?

02:58:08.264 --> 02:58:11.546
[SPEAKER_09]: Crap, let me look it up because I have my phone in my hand.

02:58:11.706 --> 02:58:14.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me do a couple other quick tweets if I can real quick.

02:58:14.427 --> 02:58:15.167
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a tweet.

02:58:15.288 --> 02:58:17.509
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this email from last week.

02:58:17.529 --> 02:58:19.710
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys remember this email last week from C.K.

02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:26.453
[SPEAKER_04]: Ender who was kind of giving us another perspective and I believe it was the email on the NSA and it was kind of making us think differently about that.

02:58:26.733 --> 02:58:30.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, CK Ender sent us a tweet and said, thanks for reading my email and giving it a fair shake.

02:58:30.936 --> 02:58:31.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Great show this week.

02:58:31.737 --> 02:58:32.317
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what?

02:58:33.158 --> 02:58:35.560
[SPEAKER_04]: Well thought out opinions.

02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:39.163
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always for presenting both sides of the story, so I'm all for that.

02:58:40.044 --> 02:58:50.712
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we also have another tweet from earlier this week from Dave Falcon, who said, to the OLR gang, Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, hope you and your families have a great Xmas and best wishes for Happy New Year.

02:58:50.752 --> 02:58:51.432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much.

02:58:51.473 --> 02:58:51.833
[SPEAKER_04]: Same to you.

02:58:52.133 --> 02:58:52.814
[SPEAKER_09]: That was kind.

02:58:52.974 --> 02:58:53.674
[SPEAKER_04]: That was very nice.

02:58:54.475 --> 02:58:56.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and Tigerclaw sent us one more tweet again.

02:58:56.237 --> 02:58:58.379
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the last call for calls.

02:58:59.140 --> 02:59:01.822
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe nobody's going to call in last show of the year except Actdeft.

02:59:01.842 --> 02:59:04.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys going to let Actdeft have the final word this year?

02:59:04.825 --> 02:59:05.646
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, one, eight, one.

02:59:05.666 --> 02:59:08.048
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Actdeft has earned the final word.

02:59:08.633 --> 02:59:12.915
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:13.936 --> 02:59:18.058
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw305 sending us a tweet here, and this will probably be the last one for the year.

02:59:18.638 --> 02:59:22.920
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn discovered on 3DS purchased as Christmas present for 8-year-old.

02:59:23.561 --> 02:59:25.162
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that.

02:59:25.202 --> 02:59:27.223
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe this didn't make it in the show roll.

02:59:27.263 --> 02:59:29.584
[SPEAKER_02]: I even came across this this week and meant to put it in.

02:59:29.764 --> 02:59:36.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's why I don't necessarily like talking about this article.

02:59:36.891 --> 02:59:39.774
[SPEAKER_04]: This really at its core has nothing to do with gaming.

02:59:40.575 --> 02:59:44.439
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just shithead moves giving all of us a bad name.

02:59:44.479 --> 02:59:47.462
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying you can't put porn on your 3DS.

02:59:47.562 --> 02:59:47.983
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

02:59:48.103 --> 02:59:49.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Put all the porn you want on your 3DS.

02:59:50.405 --> 02:59:53.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Get rid of it if you're going to sell it to a third party.

02:59:53.486 --> 02:59:55.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Because A, you want to get rid of your personal data.

02:59:55.967 --> 02:59:57.947
[SPEAKER_04]: B, what if that's you in that porn?

02:59:58.187 --> 03:00:00.108
[SPEAKER_09]: Most companies have a protocol for removal.

03:00:00.228 --> 03:00:02.048
[SPEAKER_02]: Which this company should have done.

03:00:02.068 --> 03:00:03.909
[SPEAKER_02]: In words and not in execution.

03:00:04.029 --> 03:00:05.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but during the Christmas season.

03:00:06.049 --> 03:00:10.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it is a link to a local news story.

03:00:11.631 --> 03:00:12.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it's local news.

03:00:12.891 --> 03:00:14.012
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta bring it up here.

03:00:14.152 --> 03:00:15.952
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta see how the local news... You know what?

03:00:15.972 --> 03:00:18.674
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys aren't gonna call us on Skype, then we're gonna entertain ourselves here.

03:00:19.634 --> 03:00:20.294
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's worse?

03:00:20.535 --> 03:00:20.735
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

03:00:21.655 --> 03:00:22.275
[SPEAKER_02]: My local news.

03:00:22.295 --> 03:00:23.976
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually recognize the station.

03:00:24.556 --> 03:00:26.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was... It's Colorado's local... Colorado's news?

03:00:26.937 --> 03:00:27.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver's local NBC.

03:00:27.738 --> 03:00:28.178
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

03:00:28.638 --> 03:00:28.938
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

03:00:28.978 --> 03:00:29.619
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see here.

03:00:29.659 --> 03:00:31.500
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna try to bring this up here in studio real quick.

03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:34.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I did not screen this, so we're gonna take a look at this.

03:00:34.761 --> 03:00:35.461
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it live!

03:00:35.661 --> 03:00:36.222
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fuck it!

03:00:36.242 --> 03:00:36.902
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do it live!

03:00:38.786 --> 03:00:39.246
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

03:00:39.286 --> 03:00:39.726
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is it?

03:00:39.906 --> 03:00:40.547
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the story?

03:00:41.627 --> 03:00:42.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here it is.

03:00:42.507 --> 03:00:43.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Wavy?

03:00:44.788 --> 03:00:47.789
[SPEAKER_04]: DaveyWavyNews10 reports on this story.

03:00:47.929 --> 03:00:48.549
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

03:00:49.409 --> 03:00:52.570
[SPEAKER_04]: W-A-V-Y, 10 on your side.

03:00:53.450 --> 03:00:54.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what?

03:00:55.431 --> 03:00:55.971
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it says.

03:00:55.991 --> 03:00:57.932
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, W-A-V-Y is not out of Colorado.

03:00:58.092 --> 03:00:59.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that out of Hampton, Virginia?

03:01:02.185 --> 03:01:02.465
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know

03:01:20.209 --> 03:01:29.358
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course there's a... They want... It's a hilarious local ad for a car place that's selling tires with... At least it's not twerking Santa.

03:01:29.518 --> 03:01:31.039
[SPEAKER_04]: Santa shaking his butt there.

03:01:32.501 --> 03:01:33.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

03:01:33.101 --> 03:01:34.322
[SPEAKER_04]: I know which part of Virginia this is.

03:01:34.362 --> 03:01:34.843
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been here.

03:01:34.943 --> 03:01:35.283
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

03:01:36.304 --> 03:01:37.524
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

03:01:37.604 --> 03:01:42.505
[SPEAKER_00]: A family in Hampton finds sexual images on their son's new gaming console.

03:01:42.665 --> 03:01:43.885
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought it for Christmas.

03:01:43.945 --> 03:01:46.846
[SPEAKER_00]: Their son was the first to discover the disturbing images.

03:01:47.166 --> 03:01:51.547
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 on your side's Jason Marks is investigating... And they bought it for Christmas!

03:01:53.627 --> 03:01:56.568
[SPEAKER_04]: The way she sing-songed that really disturbed me.

03:01:56.848 --> 03:01:57.968
[SPEAKER_00]: ...how this could have happened.

03:01:58.008 --> 03:01:58.348
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason?

03:01:58.488 --> 03:02:00.908
[SPEAKER_01]: Anita, that's the question everyone is asking.

03:02:01.008 --> 03:02:03.929
[SPEAKER_01]: How could porn get on a newly bought Nintendo DS?

03:02:04.718 --> 03:02:06.879
[SPEAKER_12]: How do people put things on memory cards?

03:02:06.919 --> 03:02:10.080
[SPEAKER_04]: How does porn get on something connected to the internet?

03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:11.840
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that happen?

03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:12.741
[SPEAKER_04]: That blows my mind.

03:02:13.021 --> 03:02:16.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, how does porn get on an internet-enabled device?

03:02:17.762 --> 03:02:19.063
[SPEAKER_09]: Because someone owned it before.

03:02:20.543 --> 03:02:20.743
Oh.

03:02:21.323 --> 03:02:24.924
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why did Channel 10 have to invent... Because they're stupid.

03:02:25.685 --> 03:02:27.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, we haven't seen this the whole way through.

03:02:27.605 --> 03:02:28.806
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're stupid.

03:02:28.886 --> 03:02:29.366
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at it.

03:02:29.386 --> 03:02:29.666
[SPEAKER_01]: They're stupid.

03:02:29.686 --> 03:02:31.046
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great for us playing this clip on the show.

03:02:31.066 --> 03:02:32.687
[SPEAKER_01]: A gift that was meant for an eight-year-old.

03:02:34.048 --> 03:02:37.551
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally he would be asking to play on his DS and hasn't yet.

03:02:37.851 --> 03:02:43.816
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, any kid who just got a Nintendo DS Christmas morning would be chomping at the bit to play the system.

03:02:44.497 --> 03:02:49.381
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tom Mayhew's 8-year-old son got an eyeful just after opening his gift.

03:02:49.681 --> 03:02:53.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Later on during the day he went to play his games, not knowing anything was on it.

03:02:54.545 --> 03:03:02.487
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after a while, they took a picture of themselves, a couple of the kids that were here, and when the picture was taken, it went to a file.

03:03:03.648 --> 03:03:05.968
[SPEAKER_05]: When that file was opened, there was already pictures on it.

03:03:06.148 --> 03:03:10.469
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just any pictures, images the Hampton 8-year-old should never see.

03:03:10.689 --> 03:03:19.392
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a shocker because we had quite a bit of the family over, so there was a lot of kids here, and the kids were the ones that discovered those pictures.

03:03:20.342 --> 03:03:21.844
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:41.602
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, when you open the 3DS, you don't think, oh, I better go in and check all the pictures, you know, and that whole thing.

03:03:41.642 --> 03:03:43.483
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes sense that, oh, the kids took the picture.

03:03:43.743 --> 03:03:47.445
[SPEAKER_04]: They went to go look at the pictures of themselves in OMG boobs, you know.

03:03:47.525 --> 03:03:49.385
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, the story does make sense.

03:03:49.725 --> 03:03:51.906
[SPEAKER_12]: And the thing, too, is they bought it new.

03:03:51.926 --> 03:03:53.847
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't like they were buying the used system.

03:03:54.027 --> 03:03:54.988
[SPEAKER_12]: So they claim.

03:03:55.688 --> 03:03:55.948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

03:03:56.008 --> 03:03:57.749
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the text of the article.

03:03:57.769 --> 03:04:01.870
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they bought it from Walmart, though, so Walmart doesn't sell used stuff.

03:04:01.930 --> 03:04:03.611
[SPEAKER_12]: Walmart does open box.

03:04:04.634 --> 03:04:06.242
[SPEAKER_09]: Walmart will sell a return.

03:04:06.943 --> 03:04:09.325
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayu says the DS had a dozen pornographic pictures

03:04:34.466 --> 03:04:36.907
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he wants to know where they came from.

03:04:37.328 --> 03:04:40.189
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why don't you ask the lady?

03:04:41.970 --> 03:04:43.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they could have been like internet porno, who knows.

03:04:43.831 --> 03:04:44.271
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big mistake.

03:04:44.291 --> 03:04:46.573
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to note that people will think that.

03:05:01.806 --> 03:05:02.466
[SPEAKER_04]: They're dumb.

03:05:28.383 --> 03:05:29.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

03:05:43.951 --> 03:05:45.371
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very different situation.

03:06:07.518 --> 03:06:09.141
[SPEAKER_02]: These were not pictures.

03:06:09.281 --> 03:06:13.788
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can save things, save images from the browser to the SD card or what have you.

03:06:14.048 --> 03:06:15.471
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting, it wasn't pictures.

03:06:17.134 --> 03:06:19.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayu tells us the pictures were time stamped in early December.

03:06:19.835 --> 03:06:21.175
[SPEAKER_02]: He bought the system here at the Hampton Walmart the 23rd.

03:06:21.196 --> 03:06:24.297
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten on your side called the corporate office and were still waiting to get a call back.

03:06:43.244 --> 03:06:48.670
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so they didn't even get a comment yet.

03:06:48.730 --> 03:06:51.052
[SPEAKER_04]: They just called the corporate office and no letter yet.

03:06:51.372 --> 03:06:53.054
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's Walmart going to say to that?

03:06:53.975 --> 03:06:54.696
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.

03:06:55.377 --> 03:06:57.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly an employee was putting boobies on our 3DS.

03:06:57.959 --> 03:06:58.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a gift card.

03:06:58.840 --> 03:06:59.901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, here's a gift card.

03:07:01.143 --> 03:07:01.883
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me let this finish.

03:07:02.304 --> 03:07:04.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Mainly is what is my youngest son doing?

03:07:07.591 --> 03:07:10.155
[SPEAKER_01]: Dad plans to soon have the talk with his son.

03:07:10.796 --> 03:07:14.363
[SPEAKER_01]: A conversation he thought would only come several years from now.

03:07:14.723 --> 03:07:15.645
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an eye opener.

03:07:16.586 --> 03:07:17.829
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would those even be on there?

03:07:20.037 --> 03:07:23.899
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayu says he found another clue that could show that there was a return system.

03:07:23.939 --> 03:07:27.901
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nintendo DS comes with parental controls that require a password.

03:07:28.241 --> 03:07:33.564
[SPEAKER_01]: On his DS, the parental controls were already set up, password included.

03:07:34.044 --> 03:07:36.826
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, we're still waiting for Walmart to call us back.

03:07:37.086 --> 03:07:39.408
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember going through that.

03:07:39.648 --> 03:07:41.589
[SPEAKER_04]: Walmart sold a return system as new.

03:07:41.609 --> 03:07:42.269
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they did.

03:07:42.289 --> 03:07:44.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

03:07:44.291 --> 03:07:44.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

03:07:45.011 --> 03:07:49.894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Davey Wavy News for the clip there.

03:07:50.495 --> 03:08:02.742
[SPEAKER_09]: To be perfectly honest, I think that especially if that was just a re-boxed return then yeah, he's within his rights to first of all, request a new system and have that sent back.

03:08:03.183 --> 03:08:04.303
[SPEAKER_09]: Because clearly

03:08:05.604 --> 03:08:08.385
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, I'm trying to remember what it is too.

03:08:08.985 --> 03:08:14.387
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't sell a used system without marking that it has been used or a refurb.

03:08:15.207 --> 03:08:23.009
[SPEAKER_09]: That goes against, I'm trying to wrap my brain because I was reading up on the resale law too just not too long ago.

03:08:23.769 --> 03:08:25.450
[SPEAKER_09]: That has to do with truth in advertising.

03:08:26.290 --> 03:08:28.231
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that at Fry's all the time too.

03:08:28.251 --> 03:08:30.151
[SPEAKER_09]: But Fry's will flat out say return.

03:08:30.371 --> 03:08:32.512
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a big sticker on it that says this is a return.

03:08:32.532 --> 03:08:32.892
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

03:08:33.552 --> 03:08:38.374
[SPEAKER_09]: When you go to any other retailer, it will say refurbished.

03:08:38.674 --> 03:08:44.656
[SPEAKER_04]: In the rush of the holidays, that didn't happen at this Walmart, and now they're going to get right through the coals for it.

03:08:44.696 --> 03:08:45.716
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

03:08:45.956 --> 03:08:48.477
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can't think of a company that deserves it more, but still.

03:08:48.777 --> 03:08:49.317
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

03:09:13.463 --> 03:09:28.861
[SPEAKER_04]: and for all we know this should be common sense regardless this prank was probably this whole thing was probably a prank if you think about it the whole thing was probably a setup because there's probably some assholes watching the news giggling yeah oh yeah absolutely the whole thing's probably a setup we showed that little kid some dick

03:09:30.103 --> 03:09:32.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of fucked up in a way.

03:09:32.245 --> 03:09:36.628
[SPEAKER_12]: Or plot twist, it was the news station that returned it with support on it.

03:09:36.668 --> 03:09:37.408
[SPEAKER_04]: For ratings.

03:09:38.149 --> 03:09:39.510
[SPEAKER_04]: For ratings.

03:09:39.550 --> 03:09:40.870
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to make some waves.

03:09:41.851 --> 03:09:43.692
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think either of those are the case.

03:09:43.933 --> 03:09:46.835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was a new system and I don't think it was intentional.

03:09:47.755 --> 03:09:55.761
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a guy that did something, or perhaps not even a guy, but it was somebody that did something with the system and ultimately didn't want it because they didn't want to

03:09:56.401 --> 03:10:18.737
[SPEAKER_02]: have to continue to pay for new things so they took it back it was just before there's a myriad of other possibilities considering it was just before Christmas I don't I'm with you on the fact that this isn't gaming news and this is just tripe if that's even the correct word to use in this situation this is slow news week news alright fair enough

03:10:19.116 --> 03:10:20.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well that is going to do it.

03:10:20.217 --> 03:10:21.439
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to close up the Skype line.

03:10:21.479 --> 03:10:22.060
[SPEAKER_04]: How sad.

03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:29.369
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have thought more of you would want to see our new studio cam on Skype, but I guess I'll have to wait until next week.

03:10:29.849 --> 03:10:31.111
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft didn't say anything about it either.

03:10:31.331 --> 03:10:32.833
[SPEAKER_02]: He was talking about it in chat.

03:10:32.973 --> 03:10:37.539
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have thought the first caller would have been like, whoa, I can see you guys now.

03:10:38.740 --> 03:10:42.123
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if we get one more call, I'll even be willing to let it point at me.

03:10:42.203 --> 03:10:42.764
[SPEAKER_04]: I closed it.

03:10:43.344 --> 03:10:43.685
[SPEAKER_04]: Too late.

03:10:43.745 --> 03:10:44.445
[SPEAKER_02]: You lose.

03:10:44.706 --> 03:10:47.869
[SPEAKER_04]: It will have to be a 2014 enhancement to the show.

03:10:47.949 --> 03:10:49.970
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Actdeft got a sneak peek because he was willing to call.

03:10:50.371 --> 03:10:50.711
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

03:10:50.731 --> 03:10:53.474
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to close up the Skype line and we're going to close up shop here.

03:10:54.414 --> 03:10:56.695
[SPEAKER_04]: at Orange Lounge Radio for the night and for the year.

03:10:56.955 --> 03:10:59.056
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you guys as always for being here.

03:10:59.357 --> 03:11:00.377
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening to the show.

03:11:00.677 --> 03:11:03.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for supporting the show all year long.

03:11:03.639 --> 03:11:07.941
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're new this year or you've been listening for the past eight years, we really appreciate your support.

03:11:08.601 --> 03:11:11.102
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or five about the show.

03:11:11.502 --> 03:11:12.623
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really appreciate it.

03:11:13.163 --> 03:11:14.644
[SPEAKER_04]: Spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

03:11:14.664 --> 03:11:15.884
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we have is word of mouth.

03:11:16.385 --> 03:11:18.005
[SPEAKER_12]: I did have a last minute story real quick.

03:11:18.045 --> 03:11:18.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you do?

03:11:18.486 --> 03:11:20.386
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, real quick.

03:11:20.587 --> 03:11:21.027
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

03:11:21.067 --> 03:11:21.507
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

03:11:22.543 --> 03:11:38.814
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, apparently at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress, which is a hacker con, they demonstrated that they have cracked the Nintendo Wii U gamepad controller to allow streaming of PC content to it.

03:11:39.194 --> 03:11:41.796
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can use it almost like Nvidia's Shield.

03:11:42.036 --> 03:11:42.617
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.

03:11:43.637 --> 03:11:50.122
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, it's obviously early and a little bit buggy, but they're releasing code out there to

03:11:51.144 --> 03:11:51.804
[SPEAKER_12]: Make that happen.

03:11:51.844 --> 03:11:56.770
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently they're building tools to allow that to stream stuff on Windows and OSX.

03:11:58.452 --> 03:12:00.414
[SPEAKER_02]: CCC is an amazing collective.

03:12:00.634 --> 03:12:02.636
[SPEAKER_02]: They do some fantastic shit.

03:12:03.177 --> 03:12:03.978
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them so much.

03:12:04.038 --> 03:12:05.360
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great news.

03:12:06.581 --> 03:12:07.982
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't they also crack the Wiimote?

03:12:09.865 --> 03:12:10.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

03:12:11.503 --> 03:12:13.424
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what name went behind that.

03:12:14.225 --> 03:12:25.332
[SPEAKER_02]: If you caught the news about the lifting fingerprints off the phone in order to fake out the iPhone 5S's fingerprint sensor, that was also a CCC project.

03:12:26.233 --> 03:12:31.276
[SPEAKER_02]: They are based out of Germany, and a co-worker of mine has been to a handful of their meetups before.

03:12:32.817 --> 03:12:34.718
[SPEAKER_02]: If I ever find myself in Germany, I would love to go.

03:12:36.903 --> 03:12:37.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

03:12:38.424 --> 03:12:39.525
[SPEAKER_04]: Some thoughts in our chat room.

03:12:39.565 --> 03:12:41.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator saying, here's a thought on the porn story.

03:12:41.986 --> 03:12:50.431
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the odds that a parent, probably the dad, was testing out the system before it was wrapped, forgot that the pics were on the system, and when the pics were discovered, the parents tried covering their asses?

03:12:50.891 --> 03:12:56.394
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, crazier things have happened in the world, but in this case, I don't really think that's happened.

03:12:56.434 --> 03:12:58.616
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what's interesting?

03:12:58.636 --> 03:12:59.916
[SPEAKER_04]: My finger slipped on the trigger.

03:12:59.936 --> 03:13:01.397
[SPEAKER_04]: There's guys sitting at home watching Channel 10.

03:13:01.477 --> 03:13:03.598
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem, too, is the date stamp is different.

03:13:03.618 --> 03:13:05.760
[SPEAKER_12]: The date stamp's earlier than he purchased it.

03:13:05.960 --> 03:13:06.320
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

03:13:07.136 --> 03:13:09.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well anyway, okay, we really are going to wrap up the show.

03:13:09.558 --> 03:13:13.462
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to talk, for the first time in my life, I don't want to talk about porn anymore.

03:13:13.482 --> 03:13:17.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that is going to do it though for another episode.

03:13:17.206 --> 03:13:18.887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Christmas miracle!

03:13:20.009 --> 03:13:20.609
[SPEAKER_07]: Christmas is over.

03:13:20.629 --> 03:13:21.270
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go, kid!

03:13:21.690 --> 03:13:21.990
[SPEAKER_07]: Dick!

03:13:22.871 --> 03:13:24.193
[SPEAKER_07]: You get dick for Christmas!

03:13:24.793 --> 03:13:39.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it, we're done, we're out of here Thank you guys so much for supporting the show And again, tell a friend about the show We're going to go around and get final thoughts Jason, thank you for being here, taking the trek from the Bay Area to be here I'm hoping we can at least do one show in your neck of the woods at some point It will be wonderful if it comes to fruition

03:13:39.873 --> 03:13:40.153
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.

03:13:56.149 --> 03:13:56.610
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:14:13.071 --> 03:14:15.812
[SPEAKER_04]: We did do a live show there during one of the E3s.

03:14:15.832 --> 03:14:19.213
[SPEAKER_04]: That would probably be the last time we did a full-on show, start to finish, remote.

03:14:19.233 --> 03:14:20.194
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really cool setup.

03:14:20.214 --> 03:14:21.374
[SPEAKER_04]: That was only a couple years ago.

03:14:21.394 --> 03:14:23.335
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, what, 2006, I think?

03:14:23.355 --> 03:14:24.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, just a couple.

03:14:25.475 --> 03:14:26.115
[SPEAKER_04]: Good memories, though.

03:14:28.736 --> 03:14:29.377
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's it.

03:14:29.637 --> 03:14:30.637
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go around and get final thoughts.

03:14:30.677 --> 03:14:31.917
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, now is your turn.

03:14:32.037 --> 03:14:32.638
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought?

03:14:33.638 --> 03:14:34.778
[SPEAKER_04]: Merry fucking 2014, people.

03:14:36.039 --> 03:14:36.759
[SPEAKER_04]: Good final thought.

03:14:37.719 --> 03:14:39.760
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki via the Skype line, your final thought?

03:14:42.099 --> 03:14:46.282
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like Grand Theft Auto V is becoming the hacker fest as Grand Theft Auto IV was.

03:14:46.442 --> 03:14:50.965
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to be interesting how they slap the wrists of all these people doing that.

03:14:51.145 --> 03:14:52.246
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been hearing that, actually.

03:14:52.586 --> 03:14:53.167
[SPEAKER_04]: What a shock.

03:14:53.347 --> 03:14:57.429
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so shocked that somebody has hacked Grand Theft Auto V. This is so surprising.

03:14:58.350 --> 03:14:59.310
[SPEAKER_04]: They made it so easy.

03:14:59.390 --> 03:15:01.592
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the problem.

03:15:02.560 --> 03:15:31.577
[SPEAKER_04]: my final thought tonight is I feel really good you know what this has been a really good year for the show one of our best since probably and I'm not really talking quality like this show's always good no but you know we always we always try to bring it every week but just just in terms of like the growth of the show and everything this has been probably like our best year since like podcasting went live so I just like really want to thank everybody again for their support and the new listeners we've got over the year and just you know thank you for being a part of our little family here on Sunday nights really appreciate it thank you

03:15:32.057 --> 03:15:33.958

03:15:34.278 --> 03:15:38.541
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually going to retire Reject False Icons because Gorillaz is gone.

03:15:39.341 --> 03:15:40.162
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they officially?

03:15:40.422 --> 03:15:43.964

[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

03:15:52.728 --> 03:15:54.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Think before you speak, think before you type.

03:15:55.570 --> 03:15:57.451
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, don't be an asshole.

03:15:58.378 --> 03:16:00.359
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the number one rule of gaming online.

03:16:00.379 --> 03:16:00.999
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a dick.

03:16:01.559 --> 03:16:02.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, way too many people do it.

03:16:03.319 --> 03:16:03.959
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.

03:16:03.999 --> 03:16:06.580

[SPEAKER_04]: Do not drive.

03:16:13.402 --> 03:16:14.042
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not drive.

03:16:14.122 --> 03:16:14.962
[SPEAKER_04]: Have your plan to get home.

03:16:14.982 --> 03:16:15.802
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't get married.

03:16:15.902 --> 03:16:17.063
[SPEAKER_04]: Before New Year's Eve.

03:16:18.303 --> 03:16:19.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have a Britney Spears wedding.

03:16:20.325 --> 03:16:21.307
