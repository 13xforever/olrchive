1
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:16,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, we're going to take it a little bit easier.

2
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:21,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Christmas is right around the corner and we're all getting presents from Nintendo, Rockstar, LucasArts, and Ortale.

3
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:25,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Help us unwrap all the goodness contained within this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:36,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:43,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this December the 22nd, 2013, episode number 532.

6
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:52,805
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and gamer et cetera, et cetera, with my co-hosts.

7
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:56,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:56,408 --> 00:00:58,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wearing my Charlie the Unicorn shirt tonight.

9
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,391
[SPEAKER_02]: How are things going for you?

10
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:27,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I am pretty happy today.

11
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:33,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I am officially down one whole jean size since I started my exercise and fitness program.

12
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,381
[SPEAKER_09]: You have been on quite the little weight loss quest and you've been very successful in that.

13
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:43,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the numbers on the scale don't matter to me as much as the inches I've gone down.

14
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:45,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, it's one thing to see the numbers on the scale.

15
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:48,329
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another to put on a pair of pants that used to not fit and then they do.

16
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm also doing a lot of weight lifting.

17
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:54,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing that happens when you lift weights is you actually do gain weight.

18
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,874
[SPEAKER_02]: But muscle burns more.

19
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:59,055
[SPEAKER_02]: It boosts your metabolism more.

20
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to eat a lot more, which is great because I love to eat.

21
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:03,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't?

22
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had to increase my caloric intake by 200 calories.

23
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:07,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Who doesn't?

24
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:13,341
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, my work holiday party went out for spaghetti, and I was like, I can't think of a better food right this time of year.

25
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Spaghetti is the best.

26
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:16,869
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

27
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,933
[SPEAKER_09]: So you were posting in the VOG forums about this stuff, trying to get others to join you or whatever, right?

28
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:47,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an account on Nerd Fitness, and I linked my account on the VOG forums, but I would actually, because people come in on the New Year and really think, I'm going to do it this time, and then they go, no.

29
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:50,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I am here to be everybody's life coach.

30
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:53,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually want to do something with everybody.

31
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:55,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry, Jamie will fix it.

32
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:56,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Work harder!

33
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:57,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Lift more!

34
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Eat less!

35
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:06,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really would like to encourage, and the whole reason, I'm not doing this for the weight or anything, even though that was part of it.

36
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,502
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm doing this for is because I actually feel a lot better.

37
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:13,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot more energy.

38
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:15,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have as bad fatigue problems as I used to.

39
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get sick as often.

40
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:30,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Since this is a video game show and you mentioned that you wanted to pick up a DDR habit again once a week, do you believe that the extra gaming and the exercise, the fitness gaming and all that, do you believe that that really can help a person turn around?

41
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:33,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, and I'm going to tell you why DDR I think is better.

42
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:37,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've been studying... Most of the time I do weightlifting, right?

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,804
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's another thing that they talk about that's called high-intensity interval training, which is pretty much what DDR kind of is.

44
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:49,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, if you don't know what DDR is, Dance Dance Revolution, that game with the arrows and the floor mat, you know...

45
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:59,234
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point is to push your hardest limit for like a minute, and then you spend two minutes doing it at a more normal pace.

46
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:04,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, it would be starting off with a nine-footer, doing two medium or easy songs.

47
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:07,800
[SPEAKER_09]: It would still be important that you're still walking in between your songs.

48
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,782
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the point.

49
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:16,466
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are the one playing the game and you have a three or four song game, your first one is going to be your hard one.

50
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:18,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Your next three are going to be your cool downs.

51
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:22,010
[SPEAKER_02]: You do another game, hard one, three cool downs.

52
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:28,074
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you're getting your heart rate up for that high interval and then you're relaxing because the human body is meant to function.

53
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,737
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not meant to run and do long distance and do endurance things.

54
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:35,180
[SPEAKER_02]: We're meant to GTFO when there's an animal trying to bite us in the ass.

55
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are built for fight or flight.

56
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:44,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So playing DDR, and I was thinking about this, it was like this light bulb moment.

57
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:47,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing DDR is high intensity interval training.

58
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:54,891
[SPEAKER_02]: You do, you know, you play five games of DDR, you've done 25 minutes of exercise, roughly.

59
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,992
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR itself's kind of on its way out, though.

60
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:58,813
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're still everywhere.

61
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:04,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have a lot of longtime Bomani fans, and it pains to hear that, but let's be real, y'all, it's not what it used to be.

62
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:11,760
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, you just plan on playing the old versions, or, you know, yeah, you're right, there's still arcade machines in many places.

63
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:11,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

64
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,701
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play the old versions at home.

65
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:16,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually planning on modding a new dance pad again.

66
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:21,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd like to get to the arcade and get friends together and try to recapture some of the old fun.

67
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:29,460
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think in general, it's finding your exercise where you enjoy it.

68
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, the reason why I like lifting weights is I like feeling stronger.

69
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:40,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I like being 5'2 and being able to lift an 80-pound weight over my head.

70
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:44,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And my goal is by my birthday of lifting 120 pounds.

71
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Because soon that'll be a person that you can lift over your head and throw.

72
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:47,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

73
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:48,673
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

74
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,226
[SPEAKER_09]: You are named after the Bionic Woman after all.

75
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,328
[SPEAKER_02]: This kid has gotten lighter to me because I have gotten stronger.

76
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:15,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

77
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mean to go off on it.

78
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:16,970
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's okay.

79
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really have much of a kickoff topic tonight, so this is fine.

80
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,013
[SPEAKER_09]: We can have a little extended hellos with everybody.

81
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:25,296
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do want to move on and introduce our other co-host who's been sitting there patiently waiting to be introduced.

82
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:28,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Joining us via Skype tonight, everybody, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

83
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:30,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm at home.

84
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, how you doing, Loki?

85
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,329
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

86
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:01,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

87
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:15,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Just have to be prepared.

88
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:40,622
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's probably not going to happen.

89
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:45,946
[SPEAKER_07]: She's due at the end of January, but he's measuring two weeks ahead.

90
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:53,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Josh was born at 37 weeks, so it's probably going to be the first or second week in January.

91
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:57,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she's saying maybe two more weeks and he'll be born.

92
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:07,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're being an awful... As they say in chat room, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

93
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can join us in chat if you are listening live at live.vognetwork.com.

94
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:16,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Travis Donovan, our buddy from Under Sedation Live, kicking off Loki Baby Watch 2013.

95
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:20,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Although ActDev corrects him and says it could be 2014.

96
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,779
[SPEAKER_09]: So 2013 to 2014.

97
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,782
[SPEAKER_07]: And we already have the name picked out, although I can't say what it is yet.

98
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:27,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, of course.

99
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:31,372
[SPEAKER_07]: The middle name does kind of tie into a video game.

100
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:35,758
[SPEAKER_07]: A video game I don't play, but it's still a video game.

101
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:36,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

102
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,324
[SPEAKER_07]: She asked me, so how should we spell that?

103
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,629
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I spelt it out very specifically to be like the video game.

104
00:08:44,614 --> 00:09:10,399
[SPEAKER_09]: um Alan Alchemy Strider here you is the middle name um Alan Alchemy in our chat room I love this Alan Alchemy says Nelly control that's the wife of course Nelly control Loki now the baby is here lol JK I needed you to get off Skype I can't handle your Nintendo rants when they're happening where I can hear them now go get me Chipotle odds of that happening pretty slim all right um

105
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,094
[SPEAKER_07]: She's out of the house until 8 o'clock.

106
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:15,956
[SPEAKER_07]: She goes to her mom's house and takes Josh with her.

107
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:19,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I have at least a couple hours with them gone.

108
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,880
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

109
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:29,947
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing is, though, of course, I think part of the charm of Orange Lounge Radio and the way we've done things for the past... What year are we on now?

110
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:29,947
12?

111
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:31,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Is next year year 12?

112
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:33,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I lost count.

113
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:33,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I've literally lost count.

114
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,390
[SPEAKER_07]: June it will be 12.

115
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next year.

116
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:35,351
[SPEAKER_09]: 2014 is year 12.

117
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:46,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been on the air about 12 years, and I think part of the charm of the show and part of what makes our show a little different is the fact that we're all in the same room, usually.

118
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:52,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realize there's an eleventy billion other podcasts that tape over Skype and do a great job over Skype.

119
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:55,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit, my other show, Horde House, done over Skype, and we have a great time over there.

120
00:09:56,008 --> 00:10:17,141
[SPEAKER_09]: um but you know I if if when it comes down to all right well are we gonna force everybody to be in the same room and make Loki take a month off from the show or are we gonna have him on Skype I choose having him on Skype so we'll we'll deal we'll we'll deal with the Skype thing and have a little bit of a different chemistry over the next few weeks while we wait for uh Loki baby number two to be on the way

121
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:22,414
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had Kitty Cam going, but we had to shut off because of bandwidth reasons.

122
00:10:22,474 --> 00:10:25,775
[SPEAKER_09]: She's sleeping anyway, so... Yes, there was Kitty Cam earlier.

123
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:27,916
[SPEAKER_09]: We might do some type of cam in the coming weeks.

124
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:35,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping there's going to be a new cable modem in studio in the coming weeks, and then we can look at maybe pumping out a little more with the bandwidth.

125
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:41,941
[SPEAKER_09]: But since we had some drops from live listeners in the past couple weeks, I got to watch what's going in and out, so...

126
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:50,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, but yeah, so Loki will be joining us over Skype, but it'll still be the same old same old, him doing his stories and talking about his gaming week in a moment.

127
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:58,708
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, I have to introduce here in studio, he hasn't gone anywhere, well he wasn't here last week, but he's been spending the majority of the holidays here with us at Orange Tawns Radio.

128
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:03,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello to the voice of the show, Mr. Jason, VXJasonXVXYZLMNOP.

129
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I made it!

130
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:04,651
[SPEAKER_09]: You made it!

131
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:05,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I finally made it back.

132
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:06,411
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

133
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:09,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I am doing so much better than this time last week.

134
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:11,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you had that same plague that knocked a lot of us out.

135
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:16,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it was the Saturday prior to the show.

136
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:18,257
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's impossible.

137
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have missed Sunday.

138
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:21,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Saturday was the worst of the two.

139
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:29,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunday I actually felt okay, but considering that we're jam-packed around this table when all four of us are here, I said, you know, whatever.

140
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:29,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm...

141
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:37,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ancillary and as much as I want to contribute, I'll pass because my voice was notably worse as well.

142
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,365
[SPEAKER_08]: You can kind of hear it in last week's intro.

143
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I've told you that, go back and listen to last week's intro and you'll hear it.

144
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:45,646
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably didn't notice.

145
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:51,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I pushed really hard to make sure it was clean the whole time, but the whole rest of the day, just my voice disappeared and that was that.

146
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:53,589
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:25,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually wound up, it's funny because I actually wanted to watch the show, but many of the live chatters may have noticed that I also didn't participate, and that would be because I wound up being on the phone for 10 hours with a customer.

148
00:12:25,313 --> 00:12:31,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on the phone from what was it, 6 in the evening until 4 in the morning or something like that?

149
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,218
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of a

150
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

151
00:12:55,263 --> 00:13:02,549
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I mentioned this on a previous episode of the show, but you've been hard at work on our latest endeavor into putting the shows on YouTube.

152
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:04,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been trying to expand our audience a little more.

153
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And once again, thank you for that.

154
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:10,194
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've been doing, I noticed you've been doing a little more.

155
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:14,097
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realize there's a lot going on with YouTube, especially with gaming.

156
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:15,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll get into that a little later in the news.

157
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,280
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure y'all know what I'm talking about.

158
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,321
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

159
00:13:41,299 --> 00:14:04,111
[SPEAKER_08]: so what better way than putting these two together I haven't gotten terribly crazy last week's 531's edits were I did a silly little thing with the cover art for the intro the gaming week has been there for the last two or three episodes the classic game of the week rather the video that we played in studio has been on stream for the past three episodes I think

160
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:18,836
[SPEAKER_08]: The two newer things that I did this time are that when you three were having this discussion about me last week, I put a little heart in the empty space in the top right-hand side.

161
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:22,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Just fun, tiny little thing.

162
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:23,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Left it up there for about 10 seconds.

163
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:33,462
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I'm also doing is I'm also putting the fortune cookie, a little clip of the fortune cookie of the week as the end of the video while the outro is playing.

164
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:41,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I put a clip of the fortune cookie message of the day there so that we can start linking and have that reference for visitors as well.

165
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:45,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me explain what that is real quick because we have to remember there's a large base.

166
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:48,397
[SPEAKER_09]: The podcast listeners are like, what's a fortune cookie?

167
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, we have a huge audience that isn't here live.

168
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:52,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I mention it sometimes.

169
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not huge.

170
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:56,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's not kid ourselves.

171
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,271
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our podcast.

172
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:20,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's our last little goodbye.

173
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:24,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And so our fortune cookie message is always kind of like our sign off message at the end of the night.

174
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jamie, for years and years, because we've been doing this for years.

175
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:29,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to actually make up a fortune cookie message.

176
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:43,435
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, you used to, yeah, I think back in the days of OLR, you used to have like a little saying, and then it became a little more like, I guess, what you see on The Daily Show and The Moment of Zen and all that, when we were on All Games, and now that we're here on VOG, we just kind of would sign off with that, so, yeah.

177
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:47,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my first one was, love is like wearing your pants on your face, it can make you a butthead.

178
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:54,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Still so relevant to the day.

179
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:54,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, I know, right?

180
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:57,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Some advice never changes.

181
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:00,190
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what the best literal fortune I've ever seen was?

182
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,051
[SPEAKER_02]: It was what Melody had.

183
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:05,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Great things will happen when you... Oh yeah, she got that cookie once that was not finished.

184
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:07,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's got the best one too.

185
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Every man has his enemies.

186
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:22,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I got an X-rated one once because there used to be this restaurant up in Chico because I went to school for three years up in Chico, California, which was an interesting time in my life to say the least.

187
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:26,341
[SPEAKER_09]: But they have the best Mongolian barbecue place up there.

188
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:28,122
[SPEAKER_09]: The best I've ever had to this day.

189
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:48,130
[SPEAKER_09]: and I hope they're still good but I'll give a shout out because at least 10 years ago Hula's was the bomb up in Chico I don't know if we have any listeners up there in Chico but if we do, shout out and that place is the bomb and they used to, they don't anymore but 10 years ago you asked for the special fortunes or the pink fortunes and they would bring you the X-rated cookies

190
00:16:49,213 --> 00:17:18,216
[SPEAKER_09]: and they would be things that say like you know double your pleasure double your fun fuck twins or once I got one that says doesn't this cookie look like a cunt you know like sorry explicit tag but this one time we were with a big group of people like 12 people we were all eating the fortunes we had the special ones everybody's giggling and they were like what'd you get what'd you get and then when they came to me they're like Rob what's your fortune say what's your fortune say and I'm like I can't tell you because you know what you have to eat the cookie and

191
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:19,818
[SPEAKER_09]: or the fortune doesn't come true.

192
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:25,964
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, you know, taking my sweet ass time eating the cookie, enjoying every bite, really exaggerating it.

193
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:28,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, I get to opening my fortune and reading it out loud.

194
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:31,290
[SPEAKER_09]: The fortune said, go fuck yourself.

195
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:37,918
[SPEAKER_09]: and everybody at the table is like scream laughing because all that effort.

196
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:38,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I know all that.

197
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:43,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, if I don't, you know, eat the cookie first, it won't come true.

198
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,261
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was that was the best fortune I ever got was the one that was a cookie.

199
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:48,321
[SPEAKER_09]: It told me to go fuck myself.

200
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,241
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

201
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:55,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Travis says, Rob, prove you on the right to the seat to use the C word.

202
00:17:57,724 --> 00:17:59,225
[SPEAKER_09]: How am I supposed to prove that?

203
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:05,815
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who, by the way... If you're offended by my use of that, sorry, but a cookie said it first.

204
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:08,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm not supposed to say cookie.

205
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:09,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

206
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,477
[SPEAKER_02]: No one has ever said that word as great as Bette Midler.

207
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:16,117
[SPEAKER_02]: They called me all kinds of horrible things.

208
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:22,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It started with a C and ended with a C. Me no like cookie.

209
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway, now that we've earned our explicit tag.

210
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:30,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, uh... While I'm at it, Vagina Balls Anus.

211
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:34,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

212
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:35,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

213
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:37,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, uh, it is a show about... Happy Holidays!

214
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:42,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, it's a show about video games, so, uh, we are gonna talk about video games.

215
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:46,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually don't really have much of a kickoff topic tonight, uh, which is probably for the best.

216
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:46,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one.

217
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:47,192
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

218
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:47,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you.

219
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:49,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you hate me?

220
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:50,574
[SPEAKER_02]: That's... You're telling me about Frivolow.

221
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:51,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the wine?

222
00:18:51,935 --> 00:18:53,876
[SPEAKER_02]: You and... You and Victoria.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

225
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:40,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just gonna ask kind of just generally like what are your guys's plans for the holiday week and you know are you gonna be able to get a lot of gaming in or what I know I'll probably be playing a lot of games throughout this week because I don't do a whole whole lot for the holidays and you know I have a huge but would you say you don't have a whole whole whole lot get the fuck out of my house

[SPEAKER_09]: Scram.

230
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:49,027
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I thought.

231
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:55,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, do you have anything going on this week?

232
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:58,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Games you're going to be catching up on or anything?

233
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:03,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been playing some Skullgirls, so I might play a little bit more of that.

234
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:09,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I both took advantage of Steam sales and got the Angry Video Game Nerd game.

235
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:13,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's on probably my list of new stuff to play.

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:33,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta vote for the next game so I can get my card I voted already I got my snow globe, you can't have it I definitely have the Stanley Parable I need to catch up on I bought that in the last sale That game is the fucking shit I love the Stanley Parable I've heard a lot of good things about it Jason, anything you're gonna plan on catching up on during the week?

00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:44,604
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be here to shoe in the new year.

00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:44,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

245
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:45,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And then some.

246
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Any gaming that you plan to catch up on?

247
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh...

248
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:52,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

249
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,490
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no TV in the apartment.

250
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:01,172
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a setup at the office and I could do that.

251
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:04,633
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be games but no specific plans.

252
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:07,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what about you?

253
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:08,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're waiting for the baby.

254
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:12,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

255
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe more Grand Theft Auto.

256
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:18,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I was supposed to play this weekend because they had some multiplayer event but didn't do anything there.

257
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:19,418
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

258
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:26,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing Buy Things on Steam sale the game, so yeah, there's that.

259
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:32,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Alrighty, so it sounds like everybody's just building up their backlog further of games to tackle.

260
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:35,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Every sale, every sale.

261
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I came so close to getting a PlayStation 4 this week, you guys.

262
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:42,616
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally I was just like, alright, but really, what are you going to play on it?

263
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:46,958
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have to wait until there's a couple more games on it and then I'll buy it.

264
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:49,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Multiplayer beta right now on it.

265
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:50,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, the multiplayer's in beta?

266
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, multiplayer's in beta, so you can actually play multiplayer if you want.

267
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:15,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

268
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:16,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Excited about that.

269
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:19,791
[SPEAKER_09]: SSG100 Matt in chat says, I actually bought La Mulana today.

270
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:20,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed that.

271
00:22:20,451 --> 00:22:21,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bought that today too.

272
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:22,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it.

273
00:22:22,693 --> 00:22:23,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a buck.

274
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:24,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed it.

275
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:26,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I bought it for Thanksgiving sale.

276
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:28,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll probably show up on a daily sale later.

277
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:29,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, absolutely.

278
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it in your wish list so you get notified next time.

279
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:32,760
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

280
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:50,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, uh, well let's see, I bought La Mulana today.

281
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:55,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing, I actually got back into Final Fantasy XIV, but I completely forgot what the fuck I was doing.

282
00:22:55,967 --> 00:23:01,449
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I did find I had another story quest to do, so that means I'll have to do my job quest for another few levels.

283
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:03,729
[SPEAKER_09]: With that new patch now, it's like everything's changed.

284
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Because now you can do a daily dungeon to get XP, you can do...

285
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Guild Tests to get XP.

286
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,531
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do the Guild Levs.

287
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:12,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Now give a reasonable amount of XP.

288
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,932
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do those as regular quests.

289
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:17,413
[SPEAKER_09]: The patch really changed a lot.

290
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:19,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost all of it's for the better.

291
00:23:20,214 --> 00:23:25,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been, you know, I played for a little bit, but for some reason I was getting kind of stupidly motion sick.

292
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:30,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really am trying not to play too much more until my computer upgrades finished.

293
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:34,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Dan decided to bust out our friend the credit card.

294
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:35,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And by...

295
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:52,391
[SPEAKER_02]: New cases, new CPUs, new processors, new motherboards, USB adapters, and he's buying me a new sound card as well so that the rest of our computers catch up to our bitchin' graphics cards.

296
00:23:53,192 --> 00:24:00,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, it's like you have a graphics card that can handle a horde of 20,000 and a processor that can handle 10.

297
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

298
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:06,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Tired of my games choking up, so we've been sort of taking it a...

299
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:26,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I've copied over so many things and I know Steam Cloud will back up my saves but I still want to you know like I've got all my Mass Effect stuff I have I'm going to have to manually repatch my Mass Effect 3 for the high res stuff because I don't want to have to go through the I mean I've got all the textures and everything saved and good thing I know how to do that but like

300
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:28,088
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

301
00:24:51,230 --> 00:25:10,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan did a really cool thing where online he used some website and maybe he can say it in chat but it's like a build your own PC site where you put in the components you want and it shows you what stores have it for the cheapest price so like how much your computer would cost overall I think it's like build a PC or build a PC he'll say it in chat here in a minute but he has like a computer for me saved on that site

302
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:18,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you what we often do at Fry's, and I know Fry's isn't everywhere, but we have a little app called Shop Savvy.

303
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:31,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for iPhone, Android, everything, where you scan the barcode on whatever component it is that you want, and since Fry's has to price match, that's their policy, you can use the Shop Savvy app and have them check it.

304
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:36,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll still give you whatever the lowest price you find on it is, so you don't have to really go much of anywhere else.

305
00:25:36,763 --> 00:25:37,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, nice.

306
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:38,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Shop Savvy.

307
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:39,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody use it.

308
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:42,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought my copy of Battle Royale.

309
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:44,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of paying $20 at Best Buy, I paid $10.

310
00:25:45,265 --> 00:25:49,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought my Mass Effect 3 for $30 when it was still going for $50 something.

311
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:51,567
[SPEAKER_02]: So, on the PC.

312
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:53,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just saying.

313
00:25:53,227 --> 00:25:56,188
[SPEAKER_09]: PCPartPicker.com That is the website.

314
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:56,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

315
00:25:56,728 --> 00:25:58,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Mako said it and then Alan confirmed it there.

316
00:25:58,669 --> 00:25:59,929
[SPEAKER_09]: PCPartPicker, that is the site.

317
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:04,340
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, I've been playing Animal Crossing and playing Zelda.

318
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:05,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

319
00:26:05,441 --> 00:26:09,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get past the stupid fucking worm shit in the second fucking level.

320
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:10,805
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.

321
00:26:11,926 --> 00:26:12,366
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll get there.

322
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:17,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like... And the same thing happened in The Link to the Past to me when I was...

323
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:40,593
[SPEAKER_02]: 14, 15, something and so it took me two hours to beat it on that one and I don't want it to take me that long because damn it, it's the 2010 era and I have no patience I want my gratification, give it to me so I turned off the game and drank half a bottle of wine works for me alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

324
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:44,176
[SPEAKER_09]: did Loki walk away?

325
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:44,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

326
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:46,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, are you on mute?

327
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:50,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a sec.

328
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:52,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Baby's coming.

329
00:26:52,217 --> 00:26:53,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody, show's over.

330
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,361
[SPEAKER_09]: The wonders of doing a show on Skype.

331
00:26:55,421 --> 00:26:57,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Jason, why don't I just go to you while we wait for Loki?

332
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:00,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I just bought the You Don't Know Jack Classic Pack for $5.

333
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:02,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you really?

334
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Actdeft.

335
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:03,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I seriously did.

336
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:10,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can play none of them until I figure out how to work out a Windows box for my deluge of games that I cannot play natively.

337
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:19,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of Windows and not being able to play natively, not exactly gaming, but I got a new-to-me laptop this week that is a Retina MacBook Pro.

338
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:20,808
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of amazing.

339
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:25,993
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very funny when websites and programs graphics are...

340
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:45,942
[SPEAKER_08]: you can really start to tell when they cheaped out on saving the graphics because you look at the text, it's beautiful you look at everything else, it's terrible and smudgy it's really hilarious I am enjoying this laptop so far and it's so much lighter, oh my god, I can't even put into words even though I just did

341
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:49,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a bit more Papers, Please this week.

342
00:27:49,925 --> 00:27:51,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard a lot of great things about that game.

343
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:53,687
[SPEAKER_08]: It is insanely fun.

344
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:54,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on my list.

345
00:27:54,488 --> 00:28:01,994
[SPEAKER_08]: For something so frustrating, and you definitely get the demerit, the violation kind of...

346
00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:04,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

347
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:34,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I, Codeman sent me Surgeon Simulator as a gift, and that game is, I've been wanting to play it since I've seen videos.

348
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:40,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I am hilariously bad at it, and I think everybody is, but it's so much fun.

349
00:28:41,646 --> 00:28:43,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And I picked up Electronic Superjoy for $1.50.

350
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:44,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

351
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:45,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Still need to play it.

352
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:51,550
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, the real meaning for one is, this week I bought an Xbox One and PS4 controller.

353
00:28:53,544 --> 00:28:55,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not bought the systems.

354
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:56,766
[SPEAKER_08]: They are here in my hands right now.

355
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:57,627
[SPEAKER_08]: They are here in studio.

356
00:28:57,907 --> 00:28:59,728
[SPEAKER_09]: He brought them in here and he said, look what I bought.

357
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,309
[SPEAKER_09]: And he handed me the PlayStation 4 controller.

358
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:03,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the consoles?

359
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,711
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, you bought both consoles?

360
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:05,752
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, no, just controllers.

361
00:29:05,772 --> 00:29:07,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, you're so weird, Jason.

362
00:29:08,474 --> 00:29:13,097
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason, I thought that I heard both controllers work natively with computers.

363
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:14,178
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the case.

364
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:21,764
[SPEAKER_08]: As I also recently learned, and I posted this picture to Twitter, the Xbox One controller uses Wi-Fi.

365
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:28,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And for that reason alone, game controllers via Wi-Fi on a computer are not a thing by default.

366
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:32,572
[SPEAKER_08]: That said, the PS4 controller works over USB and Bluetooth.

367
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:38,637
[SPEAKER_08]: When I first got it, I tried using Steam's big picture and playing games online.

368
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

369
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:01,582
[SPEAKER_09]: BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying to you, Jason, they said they would work eventually.

370
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:04,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they'll be, well, on Windows eventually, and then somebody will do a third-party one for the Mac.

371
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:22,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it'll happen next year.

372
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,352
[SPEAKER_08]: A bit disappointing that I can't use it already.

373
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:27,555
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting.

374
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:29,997
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox One controller has the right heft.

375
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,683
[SPEAKER_08]: And the PS4's triggers, L2 and R2, don't feel quite right.

376
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,785
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I actually, and that was my initial reaction when I actually sat down and played the game, it didn't make a difference.

377
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:47,308
[SPEAKER_08]: They both worked, tactile, responsive, felt right.

378
00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:50,971
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox One's D-pad is so much better.

379
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:54,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Even better than the Xbox 360 Pro controller.

380
00:30:54,033 --> 00:30:55,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, a hundred times yes.

381
00:30:56,515 --> 00:31:01,900
[SPEAKER_08]: The PS, I'm sorry, the Xbox One controller is so clicky in like the best way though.

382
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I just have fat thumbs, but when I do like, let's say I'm doing a Hadouken move on the little control pad there, my thumb like bumps the other thumb stick.

383
00:31:11,014 --> 00:31:12,616
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only little problem I have.

384
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:14,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I just have big thumbs.

385
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:14,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

386
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:16,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

387
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:40,505
[SPEAKER_08]: and so I went out and bought the original full-size fatty Xbox controller for myself.

388
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:45,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Those wired 360 controllers though made bomb and still do like PC controllers.

389
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:47,130
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly why I bought them.

390
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:47,830
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm using.

391
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:49,832
[SPEAKER_08]: They are the best gamepad you can get.

392
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:50,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

393
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:52,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very happy with this PS4 controller so far.

394
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:56,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Much more than my Logitech something something something.

395
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:15,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to the chatroom, live.vognetwork.com TigerClaw with another theory Jason basically bought those controllers so he can get a handle on how they feel and practice using them when he gets either of the consoles It's okay, I'm still going to suck at all the games especially if I play it against other people that actually own it but I appreciate console gamepads and I'm happy with them

396
00:32:16,926 --> 00:32:19,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so... I like that you can push the little touchpad.

397
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:23,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know how many people know this, but the touchpad is actually a button.

398
00:32:23,672 --> 00:32:29,217
[SPEAKER_08]: The touchpad doesn't work on a computer, but the fact that it is a button and can be depressed does actually work.

399
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:30,839
[SPEAKER_08]: It may work on a computer someday.

400
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:32,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, eventually.

401
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:33,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of the box, yeah.

402
00:32:34,863 --> 00:32:39,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Saw a new game that will be out next year that is in the show role, so I'll leave it for later, but it...

403
00:32:41,048 --> 00:32:49,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have screamed loudly in enthusiasm had there not been another housemate in the apartment that I'm staying in, and also in an apartment.

404
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:50,395
[SPEAKER_08]: You would have shrieked.

405
00:32:50,775 --> 00:32:51,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have.

406
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:57,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have nerd shrieked, nerdgasmed, and nerd other expletives that I will leave for your imagination.

407
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

408
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:00,702
[SPEAKER_09]: On that note, I think Loki's back.

409
00:33:00,742 --> 00:33:01,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Loki.

410
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:02,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

411
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:04,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my mom called me.

412
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:05,439
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

413
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I checked out some of the servers on there.

414
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:31,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked just a random one and I'm playing it a little bit.

415
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:32,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty fun.

416
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:36,066
[SPEAKER_07]: They had all their weapons and purchasables free.

417
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:37,687
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of neat.

418
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:41,328
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played a little bit of Saints Row 4.

419
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:47,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned before that I bought the season pass for DLC when it was on sale.

420
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:51,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I got a chance to finally play through, enter the dominatrix.

421
00:33:52,717 --> 00:34:10,867
[SPEAKER_07]: which was as expected incredibly short and unfortunately the whole joke that they were trying to go with it the whole mockumentary thing just wasn't very funny and thank god they didn't ever release Enter the Dominatrix as a full game because it would have been fucking terrible

422
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:28,224
[SPEAKER_07]: and in fact the whole thing there's only one time that I laughed in it which was at the very end of the game where you friend these raptors and so you're riding the raptors out of the simulation while they're singing this song of their people which is

423
00:34:28,976 --> 00:34:30,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Walk the Dinosaur.

424
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:36,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of funny, but the rest of it just wasn't funny at all.

425
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,224
[SPEAKER_09]: That's unfortunate to hear it's not that funny, because I associate Saints Row with one of the funniest games I've played.

426
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:54,891
[SPEAKER_07]: They tried to do some stuff that's supposed to be funny, like some of the cutscenes were animatics and literally some dude holding an action figure and doing something, and like

427
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:55,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

428
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:59,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that was supposed to be funny, but it just wasn't funny.

429
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:00,765
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like they were trying too hard.

430
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:02,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

431
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And then... I bought lots of things.

432
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:15,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I really wasn't going to spend a ton of money on the seam sale, but... That's what they all say, Loki.

433
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:16,668
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they all say.

434
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,088
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let's see what I picked up here.

435
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:23,209
[SPEAKER_07]: The orange box, because surprisingly enough, I didn't have that.

436
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:24,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

437
00:35:25,284 --> 00:35:52,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Noidu Love 2 Demvolution which is kind of like a sprite based shooter Retrograde which is kind of a space shooter slash rhythm game which is kind of neat the whole game plays backwards and so you basically have to move where bullets came from and it goes with the music then there's Ballpoint Universe Infinite which is a hand drawn game

438
00:35:54,390 --> 00:36:04,735
[SPEAKER_07]: and Blockland which is very much like Minecraft but it actually looks like Legos so that's kind of neat and they have a whole deathmatch thing with that as well.

439
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:16,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 7 and then of course Cody got me the Stanley Parable so that was pretty sweet and then today I had to pick up La Mulana because it's down to like a buck something.

440
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't believe I missed it.

441
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:19,161
[SPEAKER_09]: So upset.

442
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:22,683
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always catch the yesterday sales though.

443
00:36:22,923 --> 00:36:23,583
[SPEAKER_02]: They repost them.

444
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:24,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wasn't that a flash sale?

445
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:25,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

446
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:26,932
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a flash sale, yeah.

447
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:27,912
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll come up again.

448
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:30,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not worried about it.

449
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, pretty much that.

450
00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:35,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I don't think I actually played any Grand Theft Auto Online.

451
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:36,975
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been doing some mass bannings.

452
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully, I didn't get caught up in that.

453
00:36:39,336 --> 00:36:42,637
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, that's it.

454
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:49,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Just trying to get through the DLC stuff for Saints Row 4 since my save got pretty much eradicated.

455
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I've been kind of running through that real fast.

456
00:36:53,607 --> 00:37:00,922
[SPEAKER_07]: and I still haven't unlocked the Christmas DLC because that's later on in the game so once I get to that I'll talk about that.

457
00:37:00,942 --> 00:37:04,931
[SPEAKER_07]: At least hopefully that has the potential to be a little bit funnier than this last one.

458
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:33,453
[SPEAKER_09]: alrighty getting into my gaming week talking about some games I've played before and I've talked about before more Final Fantasy 14 loving the new patch being able to level up an alternate job class much better than just fate partying to death so that's amazing I love it and thank you to generous listeners by the way I know some folks have mentioned Codeman got them games Codeman got me a game too X-Link was kind enough to get me a game too so I just want to

459
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:35,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank the listeners, General.

460
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,433
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys really don't have to.

461
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:36,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

462
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:40,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of generous listener, did you see in chat what DarkTetsuya said?

463
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:43,055
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says, Rob, if you want it, you can have my Steam.

464
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:43,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

465
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:43,955
[SPEAKER_09]: What a nice.

466
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:44,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

467
00:37:44,435 --> 00:37:45,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I want it.

468
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:46,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

469
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:47,135
[SPEAKER_09]: That's amazing.

470
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:47,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

471
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:52,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I can pay you in doggy coins.

472
00:37:52,836 --> 00:37:53,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is it Doge?

473
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:54,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

474
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,657
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you say the D-O-G-E?

475
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:57,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just dog coins?

476
00:37:57,537 --> 00:37:58,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I say doggy.

477
00:37:58,837 --> 00:37:59,137
[SPEAKER_09]: It's dog.

478
00:37:59,377 --> 00:37:59,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

479
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:01,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not gotten it.

480
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:01,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

481
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:02,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Tangent Train.

482
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:03,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Choo, choo, choo.

483
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:04,438
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

484
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:22,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, such, such impress.

485
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:23,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Many excite.

486
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:23,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

487
00:38:24,224 --> 00:38:24,964
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that whole thing.

488
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:27,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, uh, so I, I just started going link, link, link.

489
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:32,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And I read all this stuff on it and suddenly I'm like mining coins and getting all this stuff.

490
00:38:32,165 --> 00:38:34,426
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, I have doggy coins.

491
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:38,587
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can pay you, I can pay you, uh, for La Milana and doggy coins.

492
00:38:38,627 --> 00:38:40,487
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want dark to see it, just get a wallet for it.

493
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,048
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, anyway, sorry.

494
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:49,269
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like a totally random tangent, but that was taking up like that was insomnia night, much insomnia, such clicking links.

495
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:49,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

496
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:51,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it Dog.

497
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:51,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Dog?

498
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:53,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

499
00:38:53,251 --> 00:38:53,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Doggy.

500
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:55,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a correct way to pronounce it?

501
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:56,333
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I want to know.

502
00:38:56,393 --> 00:38:58,895
[SPEAKER_08]: My understanding of it is that it's born out of Homestar Runner.

503
00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:01,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it?

504
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:10,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know why letters were, why like the word, the spelling D-O-G-E was introduced, but Homestar Runner was making fun of people calling each other Dog.

505
00:39:11,443 --> 00:39:18,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So he kind of drawed out Dog and spelled it D-O-G-E, presumably like an animation caption.

506
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:19,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to go see the episode.

507
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:24,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to read the things going through from several people.

508
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:30,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Lounge Radio, such audio, many commentary, very podcast.

509
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:33,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Such audio, many commentary, very podcast.

510
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:37,424
[SPEAKER_02]: BuzzFeed put a bunch of those up, by the way, about different political things.

511
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:39,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, BuzzFeed likes to jack everything.

512
00:39:39,325 --> 00:39:41,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I laughed my ass off.

513
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:42,806
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a great Tumblr.

514
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,168
[SPEAKER_09]: It's BuzzFeed without GIFs.

515
00:39:46,228 --> 00:39:50,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just the writing.

516
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can see how fucking awful it is.

517
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:53,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry.

518
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:55,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Total train derailment.

519
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:56,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go back to my games.

520
00:39:56,213 --> 00:39:56,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Choo-choo.

521
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,364
[SPEAKER_09]: BlackWolf made a one-off comment on it.

522
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:47,898
[SPEAKER_09]: while we were playing Final Fantasy XIV because he won't admit it y'all but Bobby Blackwolf got addicted to Final Fantasy XIV in the past week and has had my help in clearing some of the early game stuff but he brought up Minecraft randomly and I was like I'm gonna go play Minecraft on 360 which had been the first time I touched it in a long time and then that exact same day they released Minecraft for the PlayStation 3 and so I was like I kinda wanna get it but like Rob you couldn't even finish your house in Minecraft PC why would you get Minecraft PlayStation 3?

523
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:51,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I just, I have to have it.

524
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:54,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, did you see Minecraft on PS3?

525
00:40:55,776 --> 00:41:03,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really, because I was going to buy it, but then they basically said it's exactly the same as the Xbox 360 one, so I was like, eh, I don't really need it.

526
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:04,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

527
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I might... Like if it was...

528
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:07,507
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX ONE XBOX ONE

529
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than Minecraft Portable?

530
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:30,974
[SPEAKER_08]: iPhone, iPod, all that?

531
00:41:31,014 --> 00:41:31,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I forgot that existed.

532
00:41:31,894 --> 00:41:32,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, never mind.

533
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:43,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it would be the first tactile, and for as many buttons as that game has the potential of using and whatnot, Vita would be a good potential.

534
00:41:44,262 --> 00:41:47,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Vita, it would be a lot of fun on the Vita, so I'm looking... I mean, I know that's something they're making.

535
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:51,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, it's supposed to have controller support.

536
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:52,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the portable version.

537
00:41:53,007 --> 00:41:55,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they had a version with controller support

538
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:58,551
[SPEAKER_07]: for the Sony Ericsson Play.

539
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:03,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Because everybody's going to be playing it on that.

540
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:04,915
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

541
00:42:04,995 --> 00:42:08,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let me get to the game I really wanted to talk about because that was all a bunch of old stuff.

542
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:13,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me talk about the new game this week and a lot of people talking about this game and I've been playing an awful lot of this game as well.

543
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:22,866
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to talk about Nintendo Direct in a little bit and some of the stuff that they announced this week because Nintendo kind of was the big newsmaker this week because they actually did a direct with some new news.

544
00:42:23,426 --> 00:42:31,732
[SPEAKER_09]: and one of the games that they teased during this Nintendo Direct was this surprise NES Remix.

545
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:39,377
[SPEAKER_09]: A brand new game that they put out on the eShop for $15 and of course the minute I saw the trailer I was like...

546
00:42:40,237 --> 00:42:44,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Such retro games, many pixels, wow And I bought it, right?

547
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:58,139
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to just go immediately to the store and buy it Because, you know, it tickled my retro bone And I love, that sounds kind of dirty actually But, you know, I just love those retro games and collections So I went immediately to the shop and bought it Did you have a retro boner?

548
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:26,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I might have a little bit actually so you know it was it was it was a very Beyonce thing because they get it said it's on the eShop right now which was really spectacular when you consider that they went to the VGX thing the week before and decided to talk about nothing about it nothing about it was like we got Cranky Kong and that's all I'm gonna tell you Jeff Keighley and they do they do an Nintendo Direct days later with like actual news fantastic didn't

549
00:43:26,288 --> 00:43:28,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't we say that was exactly what was going to happen, though?

550
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:33,132
[SPEAKER_08]: That they were going to give another outlet nothing and still rely on their own outlets for doing this?

551
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:37,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we really had said that, but I was kind of surprised.

552
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, one week, Jason.

553
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:41,737
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one week later.

554
00:43:41,877 --> 00:43:46,039
[SPEAKER_09]: They knew all this other stuff, and they purposely held onto it for their own direct for whatever reason.

555
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:50,722
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a captive audience, and they're going to make that their point.

556
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:51,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

557
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:52,263
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay.

558
00:43:52,443 --> 00:43:56,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about NES Remix, though, because I bought the game, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen this.

559
00:43:56,326 --> 00:44:11,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Many people have been comparing it to WarioWare, which... It's kind of an iffy comparison to me, because WarioWare is very fast-paced, and the 8-bit levels and things like that were very... You know, it was like, push button, dodge.

560
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,460
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it was like one quick little thing, because that's how WarioWare was.

561
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:19,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas NES Remix is more little bite-sized samples.

562
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:20,004
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like...

563
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:24,011
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the Halloween bag full of the mini Snickers bars.

564
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,553
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fun-sized.

565
00:44:25,614 --> 00:44:27,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's like one of those fun-sized Halloween bags.

566
00:44:27,938 --> 00:44:32,306
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not micro games, but it's just enough of a taste of some of the retro games, right?

567
00:44:33,135 --> 00:44:35,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never put one of those things in my mouth and said, wow, I'm having fun.

568
00:44:35,918 --> 00:44:48,428
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the problem with NES Remix that I have, is that because it's a bag of all the little mini candies, unfortunately, some of the games they included are like the Hershey's Dark Chocolates, where it's like, I don't want that shit.

569
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:49,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, those are the best.

570
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:51,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're all yours.

571
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:57,615
[SPEAKER_09]: If you enjoy Golf, Wrecking Crew, Urban Champion...

572
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:00,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Those little candy bars are all you, girl.

573
00:45:01,503 --> 00:45:01,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy.

574
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:07,330
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to guess there's probably not a lot of fans out there of some of the games that they included in the collection.

575
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, alright, alright, alright.

576
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:14,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's the one thing that kind of... You know, because you start with, I think, six games.

577
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:42,038
[SPEAKER_09]: and then you unlock others and some of them you go oh yay I got Legend of Zelda yay yay that's a great one and then it's like oh I got golf well I won't be playing that one I mean really who likes NES golf anymore you know there's a million better golf simulations out there now maybe at the time it was a fun game for you know golf fans but now it's painful to go back and play I think is part of the issue so

578
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:48,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're playing little portions of these games.

579
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:56,085
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe it's like, get from point A to B. And it's like... Loki, you all right over there?

580
00:45:56,945 --> 00:45:57,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Easy.

581
00:45:57,766 --> 00:45:58,346
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I don't know.

582
00:45:58,786 --> 00:46:01,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they... I'm hoping they found his sister or whatever that was.

583
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:04,450
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, so... That was the GPS bell.

584
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:05,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we found her.

585
00:46:06,251 --> 00:46:07,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Many rings, such distracting.

586
00:46:08,972 --> 00:46:09,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So you...

587
00:46:10,473 --> 00:46:11,354
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

588
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,746
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

589
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck I hate the physics in this game, right?

590
00:46:54,817 --> 00:46:58,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of enough to remind you of the game and that's good enough.

591
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:00,520
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's that to get out of it.

592
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,082
[SPEAKER_09]: The remix stages, some of them are actually really cool.

593
00:47:04,643 --> 00:47:11,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there's one where you play Super Luigi Brothers or whatever where you run World 1, 2 and it's backwards.

594
00:47:12,447 --> 00:47:17,490
[SPEAKER_09]: And some stages where the camera will consistently zoom in on your character or zoom out.

595
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:20,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Brothers, like original Mario Brothers levels that scroll.

596
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:26,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though the original Mario Brothers, not Super Mario Brothers, but the original Mario Brothers was a static screen.

597
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:27,758
[SPEAKER_09]: So they do some neat things.

598
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:35,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And in playing those levels, I really realized, like, wow, Virtual Console really pisses me off.

599
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you see them doing all these neat little things...

600
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Mario Bros.

601
00:47:42,604 --> 00:47:43,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Mario Bros.

602
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:43,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Mario Bros.

603
00:47:56,616 --> 00:48:02,219
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically the same kind of changes from Mario 1, 2, and 3 NES to Super Mario All-Stars 1, 2, and 3.

604
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be honest.

605
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,281
[SPEAKER_08]: More functional maybe, but similar.

606
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:11,705
[SPEAKER_09]: The more I played NES Remix, the more frustrated I got with just everything.

607
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:17,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that's going to sound like the weirdest review in the world, but I'm just being honest, you guys.

608
00:48:18,608 --> 00:48:24,592
[SPEAKER_09]: As a gamer fan, as a retro game fan, the longer I played NES Remix, the more angry I got at Nintendo.

609
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:46,457
[SPEAKER_09]: And part of it was that all the games that are included in NES Remix are just games that are available on the eShop So the whole thing is just, you know, in some ways ads for the games that are on Virtual Console Yeah, did you like the part where you can actually link to the part in the eShop where you can purchase all those games?

610
00:48:46,538 --> 00:48:51,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because it's so adorable because you hit the button and a little Zelda screen that comes up and says, buy something, will ya?

611
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's so cute

612
00:48:54,810 --> 00:49:16,580
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's not to buy like extra levels in NES Remix it's to take you to the eShop to buy the virtual console games I don't know NES Remix left me feeling very conflicted I liked a lot of the things they tried to do with it but as the game went on my my patience for some of the NES classics using the term loosely in the Hershey's dark chocolate games if you will

613
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,881
[SPEAKER_09]: were starting to wear thin on me a little bit.

614
00:49:19,362 --> 00:49:20,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know.

615
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:23,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I only am playing it now to see what the different remix levels are.

616
00:49:24,365 --> 00:49:32,831
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I unlock a remix level that's like, play golf and get a hole-in-two in the rain, I'm like, go fuck yourself.

617
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:34,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't feel like playing that.

618
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:36,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Luckily, you can skip stages and stuff, but I don't know.

619
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:44,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought when I originally saw the headline for that, I was like, oh, look, they're doing a legitimate version of Super Mario Bros.

620
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:44,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Crossover.

621
00:49:45,714 --> 00:50:12,387
[SPEAKER_09]: But then it was, you know, like WarioWare But I don't know, it's a little more than WarioWare to me Because WarioWare, again, is hitting one button or doing one thing The NES Remix is more bite-sized chunks But it kind of serves as a big advertisement for virtual console, I don't know Go look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Let's see, DarkTetsuya says Does NES Remix do leaderboards or anything?

622
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:16,090
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but it does have Miiverse integration.

623
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:22,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you see posts from either strangers or your friends, it will show what their time was when they made the post.

624
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:28,122
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know why there's not leaderboards in there because they obviously are tracking the times.

625
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:33,547
[SPEAKER_07]: But it'd look really terrible if like you bought that game and you're like, hey, I'm going to go buy one of these virtual console games.

626
00:50:33,927 --> 00:50:34,108
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

627
00:50:34,128 --> 00:50:35,549
[SPEAKER_07]: No leaderboard for this game?

628
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:36,310
[SPEAKER_07]: The hell?

629
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:54,126
[SPEAKER_09]: BlackWolf says the main thing you need to know is that Retro Game Challenge for DS is awesome and it's the same people that's a very good point it is the same people that made Retro Game Challenge for the DS I would have rather just had that on the Wii U or like a new version of that on the Wii U with like new games or Super Nintendo games or something I would love that

630
00:50:54,787 --> 00:50:56,308
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but that's not what it is.

631
00:50:56,748 --> 00:50:57,329
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

632
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,971
[SPEAKER_09]: My feedback on NES Remix is mixed.

633
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:01,312
[SPEAKER_09]: It's truly a mixed review.

634
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:11,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, if you really like retro NES games, and you're willing to stomach some of it, and $15 doesn't seem too high of a price for you, then I say go ahead and go for it.

635
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:21,426
[SPEAKER_09]: But just realize, when you play it, you're gonna get a little disappointed that you've spent money on other virtual console titles, and yet NES Remix...

636
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:26,527
[SPEAKER_09]: does more in some of its bite-sized chunks that Virtual Console refuses.

637
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:28,008
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's the best word to use.

638
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:30,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo refuses to do with Virtual Console.

639
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:32,589
[SPEAKER_09]: They refuse to innovate it.

640
00:51:33,169 --> 00:51:36,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm left to believe that it's not that they can't.

641
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:37,270
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that they won't.

642
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:41,952
[SPEAKER_09]: They refuse because NES Remix shows that they can do more with it.

643
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:47,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that any different from any other publishers, consoles, classic game revivals?

644
00:51:48,277 --> 00:52:06,043
[SPEAKER_09]: well sure like Capcom Arcade cabinets pretty cool you can do multiplayer online and you can do the replays that save and the top high scores you can look at the little playthroughs and you have the HD graphics filters and that's all pretty cool and that's just the first collection that came off the top of my head

645
00:52:07,214 --> 00:52:33,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played a revival set in a very long time but I'm thinking back to like PS2 like the Midway arcade classics and all that kind of stuff the various Namco collections but that was on the PlayStation 2 where a lot of this integration isn't exactly possible mostly network based and friends and community and all that kind of stuff modern consoles that do have that information okay I agree that makes sense

646
00:52:34,128 --> 00:52:36,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, you saw me playing NES Remix for a little bit.

647
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:40,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you didn't get to touch it yourself, but certainly you're familiar with the Nintendo Classics.

648
00:52:40,211 --> 00:52:42,932
[SPEAKER_09]: What if you wanted to touch it, Rob?

649
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:44,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go get the tablet now and he can play.

650
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:48,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, also interesting to note, tablet does nothing.

651
00:52:49,314 --> 00:52:53,056
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a second screen, like many of the Wii U games of late.

652
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:54,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Just an interesting observation.

653
00:52:54,697 --> 00:52:57,198
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, Jason, you were watching me play.

654
00:52:57,298 --> 00:52:58,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Any thoughts from watching?

655
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:00,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you didn't get to touch, but just...

656
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:02,039
[SPEAKER_08]: I live for those kind of games.

657
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I was backseat gaming the whole time Rob was playing.

658
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you could have just dodged it.

659
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:22,184
[SPEAKER_08]: He was playing classic Mario Brothers, you know, with the three layers, and you have to hit the block with an enemy on it to flip the turtle upside down, hit the monkey, red, demon things twice, all that kind of stuff.

660
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:26,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, you could have just gone up a level temporarily in order to dodge that fireball.

661
00:53:26,105 --> 00:53:28,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I was backseat gaming the whole freaking time.

662
00:53:29,526 --> 00:53:57,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I live for that kind of game if I had a Wii U I would get that in a heartbeat it was very fun it was very fun looking it looked like it controlled well that is with regard to how the game played originally it was not improved which is kind of a good thing because it was meant to be something specific it was the most prominent parts of all of the games that you played

663
00:53:58,553 --> 00:53:59,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

664
00:54:21,498 --> 00:54:26,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I likened it to Dance Master Mode in DDRs since Extreme US.

665
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:32,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Just subtle little variations on existing content to come up with something brand new.

666
00:54:32,628 --> 00:54:33,228
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked fun.

667
00:54:34,049 --> 00:54:34,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not mind playing that.

668
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,252
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd pay $15 for it?

669
00:54:37,272 --> 00:54:40,835
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really hard to say right now.

670
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:41,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I...

671
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:45,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely would to try it out.

672
00:54:46,077 --> 00:54:47,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Would I feel like it was still worth it afterwards?

673
00:54:47,961 --> 00:54:48,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.

674
00:54:49,003 --> 00:54:49,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't touch it.

675
00:54:49,524 --> 00:54:50,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I just watched.

676
00:54:50,145 --> 00:54:50,987
[SPEAKER_08]: But it looked fun.

677
00:54:51,536 --> 00:54:52,236
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, fair enough.

678
00:54:53,117 --> 00:54:54,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Show where every gamer has a voice.

679
00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:56,199
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think about NES Remix?

680
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:00,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, or if you've played the game, maybe you disagree with some of the things I've said.

681
00:55:00,961 --> 00:55:03,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you're overwhelmingly positive or overwhelmingly negative.

682
00:55:03,763 --> 00:55:07,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the websites out there ran very negative reviews of the game this week.

683
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:08,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to try it.

684
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:14,289
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to say again, I'm leaving it with a mixed review because there was elements of what Jason's saying that I like too.

685
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:18,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I think some of these games are best experienced in bite sizes.

686
00:55:18,492 --> 00:55:18,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

687
00:55:19,732 --> 00:55:20,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

688
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:24,074
[SPEAKER_09]: There is some inherent frustration that came from this game as well.

689
00:55:25,174 --> 00:55:26,295
[SPEAKER_09]: It is what it is.

690
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:26,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Take it or leave it.

691
00:55:27,795 --> 00:55:30,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, we need to move on with the show and get into some of the other news.

692
00:55:31,157 --> 00:55:32,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me talk quickly about housekeeping.

693
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:34,158
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be here next week.

694
00:55:34,238 --> 00:55:40,880
[SPEAKER_09]: We aren't planning on taking time off for the holidays just because Sundays fall on pretty good days this year where we can do shows uninterrupted.

695
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:42,041
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be here next week.

696
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:45,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

697
00:55:46,582 --> 00:55:48,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

698
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:52,404
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on Google Plus as well, google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

699
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:53,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they're being bastards.

700
00:55:53,724 --> 00:55:54,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we'll get into that later.

701
00:55:56,265 --> 00:56:04,447
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to give a plug for this real quick because I think tomorrow is the last day that you can nominate for, no, I think it's today actually, is the last day you can nominate for the Stitcher Awards.

702
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:15,117
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe this won't do anything for our podcast listeners, but for our live listeners, would love it if you would head on over to the Stitcher website and nominate us for Best Games and Hobbies podcast.

703
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:16,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Would really, really appreciate that.

704
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:20,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And your nominations go a long way in helping us get recognized.

705
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:25,808
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember, we don't, I mean, it's not that like we're sitting here going, we deserve to get all these awards.

706
00:56:25,948 --> 00:56:33,893
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we just realized that as an independently produced show, the exposure that comes with even getting nominated is invaluable.

707
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,494
[SPEAKER_09]: That's more what we're going for.

708
00:56:35,534 --> 00:56:36,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Help us be exposed.

709
00:56:36,995 --> 00:56:39,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, help us expose ourselves all over the internet.

710
00:56:39,737 --> 00:56:40,538
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd really appreciate that.

711
00:56:41,212 --> 00:56:44,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and then I know some other VOG shows definitely worthy of nominations.

712
00:56:44,753 --> 00:56:47,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of you guys have been nominating Bobby one day and us one day.

713
00:56:47,094 --> 00:56:47,514
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

714
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:52,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Understation Live wants to do Most Original and I think that's perfect for them.

715
00:56:52,336 --> 00:56:52,776
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

716
00:56:52,816 --> 00:56:53,476
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they get that.

717
00:56:54,176 --> 00:57:01,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And certainly there's other TV and entertainment categories where Critical Myth, Pod Culture, British Invaders will all be great choices and so on.

718
00:57:02,439 --> 00:57:03,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there you go.

719
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,982
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, uh, SSG100 Matt says nominate and give all the VOG shows a nice review on Stitcher.

720
00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:08,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

721
00:57:08,623 --> 00:57:09,703
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, SSG100 Matt.

722
00:57:09,743 --> 00:57:11,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw your review on Stitcher this week and thank you.

723
00:57:11,604 --> 00:57:12,525
[SPEAKER_09]: That was, uh, great.

724
00:57:12,845 --> 00:57:15,286
[SPEAKER_09]: So those reviews really, really help.

725
00:57:15,886 --> 00:57:17,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so I really appreciate it.

726
00:57:17,087 --> 00:57:22,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And thanks to everybody at Stitcher and, uh, everywhere that's listening to podcasts for supporting the show.

727
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate it.

728
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,772
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you're having a good time listening and participating with our show.

729
00:57:26,432 --> 00:57:28,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some news.

730
00:57:28,693 --> 00:57:29,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's gonna start us off.

731
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:37,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so this was kind of unexpected when they were talking about games coming out during the whole Nintendo Direct.

732
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:39,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new Zelda game.

733
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:43,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Not exactly the Zelda game you might have been looking forward to, but it's a new one.

734
00:57:44,134 --> 00:57:46,996
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's being dubbed right now Hyrule Warriors.

735
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:54,362
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a spin-off of the Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors series.

736
00:57:55,322 --> 00:57:58,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just like that, but now set in Hyrule.

737
00:57:58,945 --> 00:57:59,746
[SPEAKER_07]: You play Link.

738
00:58:00,725 --> 00:58:15,273
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's got all the different enemies and stuff from you know the series and the same kind of gameplay you expect from like a Dynasty Warrior game so it's supposed to come out sometime in 2014 for the Wii U. What do you think about this?

739
00:58:16,154 --> 00:58:16,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it looks neat.

740
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:26,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean I think it would be a little bit more successful if it was compared to like Monster Hunter because some of the screenshots especially where they were

741
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:31,311
[SPEAKER_07]: They were going up against some of the boss monsters and stuff.

742
00:58:31,711 --> 00:58:34,812
[SPEAKER_07]: It reminded me a little bit of Monster Hunter.

743
00:58:37,073 --> 00:58:38,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it looks neat.

744
00:58:38,914 --> 00:58:41,035
[SPEAKER_07]: More than one Zelda game in a year is always good.

745
00:58:43,402 --> 00:58:46,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet another thing VGX was snubbed for from Nintendo.

746
00:58:47,544 --> 00:58:48,345
[SPEAKER_08]: We were just talking about it.

747
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:49,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

748
00:58:49,946 --> 00:58:56,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's interesting that we have another game where Nintendo has allowed a third party one of their big franchises.

749
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, granted, it's a spin-off game and not a main game, which...

750
00:58:59,431 --> 00:59:01,052
[SPEAKER_09]: We know Team Ninja and Metroid.

751
00:59:01,612 --> 00:59:03,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people liked it, some people didn't.

752
00:59:03,393 --> 00:59:04,533
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was an interesting experiment.

753
00:59:04,553 --> 00:59:07,374
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's very interesting that we have Zelda as a big one.

754
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:15,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And to let Koei Tecmo do a Dynasty Warriors type of game with that is a pretty big deal.

755
00:59:16,817 --> 00:59:24,263
[SPEAKER_09]: So, TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminding us that Hyrule Warriors is the working title.

756
00:59:24,363 --> 00:59:25,804
[SPEAKER_09]: It could have a different title later.

757
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:26,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

758
00:59:26,945 --> 00:59:30,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll give it a Legend of Zelda and a subtitle.

759
00:59:30,048 --> 00:59:37,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you think about it, things like Phantom Hourglass were kind of not really Zelda games, but they were still in kind of that canon.

760
00:59:37,733 --> 00:59:39,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, but they played very differently, so we'll see.

761
00:59:40,915 --> 00:59:46,738
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, if Nintendo was really smart, they would have other Nintendo characters as unlockables or DLC heroes to play with.

762
00:59:47,098 --> 00:59:49,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I wonder if some of the characters from Dynasty Warriors wouldn't show up.

763
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:51,259
[SPEAKER_09]: It would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

764
00:59:51,799 --> 00:59:53,700
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, I don't know if you've seen a lot about this game.

765
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I talked about it.

766
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:55,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, do you have interest in it?

767
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:56,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

768
00:59:57,161 --> 01:00:07,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but we were talking about, you know, Nintendo having this history of doing spinoffs with the Legend of Zelda series and marketing it out.

769
01:00:07,824 --> 01:00:12,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, how there were the licenses given for the 3DO and all that in the background.

770
01:00:12,885 --> 01:00:16,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking about Phantom Hourglass and the Lynx, you know, crossbow training.

771
01:00:17,286 --> 01:00:21,807
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's another cash grab, really.

772
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:21,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

773
01:00:22,447 --> 01:00:26,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you remember, this isn't the first time they've done a crossover with Tecmo Koei either.

774
01:00:26,632 --> 01:00:29,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they had, was it Romance of the Three Kingdoms with Pokemon?

775
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it was Nobunaga's Ambition, one of those.

776
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:33,080
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

777
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot about that.

778
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,161
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

779
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:57,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Tech2030 in our chatroom says Nintendo Warriors would have been a much better game maybe something a little more inclusive of other characters I don't know I think there's a lot of people that are going to buy it on Zelda alone if I was going to do one I would pick one of the Fire Emblem franchises since you've got more characters to choose from and I believe that the play style is similar but then again they just say oh well it's another you know Fire Emblem game

780
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:58,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

781
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,536
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be curious to see what happens with that game.

782
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:04,597
[SPEAKER_02]: InTech2030 actually mentioned Marth.

783
01:01:07,219 --> 01:01:12,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well something else that came out of Nintendo Direct, another game announcement, it is Dr. Luigi!

784
01:01:12,261 --> 01:01:14,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of course it is the year of Luigi, is it not?

785
01:01:15,283 --> 01:01:19,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dr. Luigi will be kind of the last big hurrah for Luigi in the year of Luigi.

786
01:01:20,346 --> 01:01:23,827
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be hitting the Wii U eShop on December 31st.

787
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:26,249
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you can probably guess, Dr. Luigi...

788
01:01:27,029 --> 01:01:28,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Mario, but starring Luigi

789
01:01:45,638 --> 01:01:47,119
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'll see you next time.

790
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:20,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you guys remember, but they actually released Dr. Mario on the Wii, and it was almost like the same thing.

791
01:02:20,096 --> 01:02:38,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it didn't have the Operation L, that's a new thing, but it had the two-player online mode, and I think I remember back then talking about it going, oh, yay, finally a Wii game by Nintendo that's like head-to-head online that's really exciting, and I think most people bought Dr. Mario, played it for a day online against like one friend, and then probably never touched it again.

792
01:02:39,241 --> 01:02:43,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't help but wonder if Dr. Luigi is going to meet a similar fate.

793
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:47,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, if they get their money, they don't care if you play it for one day or 100 days.

794
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:49,701
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think about Dr. Luigi?

795
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:56,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a Wii U, so I'll just come over here and play it.

796
01:02:56,934 --> 01:03:01,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a system seller for you, Dr. Luigi?

797
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:02,178
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

798
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:08,062
[SPEAKER_02]: If Dan and I were going to have bought a system, it would be for Wind Waker HD, and we clearly haven't bought one yet.

799
01:03:10,004 --> 01:03:11,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a seller, honestly.

800
01:03:12,165 --> 01:03:15,308
[SPEAKER_02]: If I really, really wanted to play Dr. Mario, I'd hook up my NES.

801
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:16,789
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

802
01:03:17,216 --> 01:03:17,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

803
01:03:17,616 --> 01:03:18,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, any interest in this?

804
01:03:19,737 --> 01:03:22,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I was pretty terrible at Dr. Mario.

805
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,121
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a game and it's continuing a trend of something that Nintendo's been wanting to do topically.

806
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:28,082
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cute.

807
01:03:28,682 --> 01:03:28,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

808
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:30,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably wouldn't buy it.

809
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:33,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say I was really good at Dr. Mario.

810
01:03:33,485 --> 01:03:35,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd get up to level 30-something.

811
01:03:35,706 --> 01:03:44,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I seem to remember always fast-forwarding myself to level 15 or level 20 or something like that and always dying incredibly quickly and being very frustrated and not playing the game again.

812
01:03:45,672 --> 01:03:47,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you have to start at the beginning.

813
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:52,759
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start from the beginning and build up, you acclimatize to the speed.

814
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:59,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one of those things where I didn't want to start from scratch and I wanted to make it actually difficult, but I would always make it too difficult.

815
01:04:00,387 --> 01:04:01,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And I never found that a happy medium.

816
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:06,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also talking like years and years and years ago, so I really don't remember how it all wound up playing out.

817
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:06,773
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

818
01:04:08,214 --> 01:04:15,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Eh, maybe if I'm looking for something to pad up a library with, but yeah, no particular interest in jumping on this real quick.

819
01:04:16,223 --> 01:04:18,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Loki, is this a system seller for you?

820
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:19,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, totally!

821
01:04:20,587 --> 01:04:24,391
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, seriously, Luigi's a terrible doctor, right?

822
01:04:24,992 --> 01:04:29,336
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, shoving L-shaped pills down someone's throat, it's just a choking hazard.

823
01:04:32,324 --> 01:04:45,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't help but feel like games like this and NES Remix were really rushed just to try and beef up Nintendo's offerings on the eShop for better or for worse.

824
01:04:45,234 --> 01:04:47,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess I really can't complain.

825
01:04:47,135 --> 01:04:52,319
[SPEAKER_09]: As much as I might have been a little bit critical of NES Remix earlier, there were good things about it too.

826
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:58,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And even this, I might see some negative, but I think it's very exciting that we have an online classic game.

827
01:04:58,023 --> 01:05:00,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, everything I've bitched about wanting on Virtual Console...

828
01:05:00,865 --> 01:05:03,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Luigi does kind of deliver, so I'm excited to see that.

829
01:05:03,887 --> 01:05:10,270
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, if Nintendo were to rush games like this every couple months or whatever, I wouldn't be mad.

830
01:05:11,091 --> 01:05:14,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see more of this type of stuff, especially with some of the classics.

831
01:05:14,132 --> 01:05:15,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be pretty cool.

832
01:05:16,494 --> 01:05:16,654
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

833
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:18,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Fifth Dream, by the way.

834
01:05:19,057 --> 01:05:20,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't play Dr. Mario.

835
01:05:20,037 --> 01:05:21,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too good at it and games go on for hours.

836
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:23,140
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true.

837
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,641
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

838
01:05:24,802 --> 01:05:25,222
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true.

839
01:05:25,282 --> 01:05:29,346
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're good at Dr. Mario, you have to jinx yourself.

840
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:34,090
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot start the game and just play through it and be done.

841
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:35,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen.

842
01:05:35,091 --> 01:05:39,414
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my problem with Civilization V. I'm just too good at it and suddenly it's 4 a.m.

843
01:05:39,454 --> 01:05:39,955
[SPEAKER_09]: in the morning.

844
01:05:40,996 --> 01:05:43,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I've had a three-hour game session of Dr. Mario.

845
01:05:46,028 --> 01:05:46,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, alright.

846
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:51,332
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think of a game recently that I've done something like that with.

847
01:05:51,352 --> 01:05:53,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember Every Extend Extra Extreme?

848
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:54,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

849
01:05:54,775 --> 01:05:56,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I had your copy forever.

850
01:05:56,356 --> 01:05:57,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm such a whore for Q Entertainment.

851
01:05:57,778 --> 01:06:02,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they had it on an Xbox 360, and I remember I could play that game.

852
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:05,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you just keep creating the explosions, the explosions, and do it on the beats.

853
01:06:05,764 --> 01:06:08,126
[SPEAKER_09]: You can keep that game going for hours as well.

854
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:16,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I was super drunk at my birthday and I played Luminous and got to like level 25 while I was super, super drunk and I had to actually kill myself so that I could drink my beer.

855
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:18,414
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

856
01:06:20,055 --> 01:06:22,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Blackwolf in our chat room says, humble brag.

857
01:06:24,879 --> 01:06:27,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I apparently am better at puzzle games when I'm really drunk, by the way.

858
01:06:28,221 --> 01:06:29,482
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets you in a state of zen.

859
01:06:30,663 --> 01:06:32,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in a state of I'm on my eighth beverage.

860
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:35,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, DarkSakura, I know you're sober, but maybe you can read the next story for us anyway.

861
01:06:36,337 --> 01:06:37,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe I could do that.

862
01:06:38,419 --> 01:06:53,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there is, for all the people who are super hyper, pissed off at YouTube, like just about everybody, there is a wiki set up so that you can find...

863
01:06:54,557 --> 01:07:02,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, what's going to let you do a Let's Play and monetize it, maybe, and it does not allow.

864
01:07:03,143 --> 01:07:07,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a wiki page called Who Let's Play.

865
01:07:08,127 --> 01:07:10,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can go check out the information there.

866
01:07:11,509 --> 01:07:14,791
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a quote saying that right now the issue is with music and developers.

867
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:32,710
[SPEAKER_02]: are basically have licensed music non-exclusively so that means you might be able to show a game and the game developer will be fine with it but the person who created the music has licensed it out to multiple people and not be so cool with it.

868
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:41,260
[SPEAKER_02]: But the wiki page is useful out there for, you know, knowing what you can and can't do.

869
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,721
[SPEAKER_02]: If in doubt, you can check.

870
01:07:43,462 --> 01:07:54,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a second wiki that's for, and it says in quotes, known bad actors who are basically...

871
01:07:55,715 --> 01:07:59,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it says something about music resellers, so I'm not really sure about that.

872
01:07:59,377 --> 01:08:06,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically labeling out who you can trust, who you can't trust, and what you're going to be able to do as far as that content.

873
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:12,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to clarify though, it will not stop YouTube necessarily from holding up your videos.

874
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason why I point that out... They're dicks.

875
01:08:15,601 --> 01:08:16,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yes.

876
01:08:16,622 --> 01:08:24,706
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know Loki's going to explain a little more to what's going on in a minute here, but just what's going on with me personally right now on my own channel, my video, my struggle.

877
01:08:25,646 --> 01:08:29,188
[SPEAKER_09]: is that the other day I posted a video playing Final Fantasy XIV.

878
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:30,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even remember what we were doing in it.

879
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:33,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, it was the last night of the 2.0 patch.

880
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,810
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were just running around talking.

881
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:36,191
[SPEAKER_09]: It was almost like a little mini podcast.

882
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:36,851
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a lot of fun.

883
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:39,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can check that out on my channel at Rob Roberts Plays.

884
01:08:39,812 --> 01:08:42,093
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a Final Fantasy XIV fan, we had a lot of fun with that.

885
01:08:42,754 --> 01:08:49,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And YouTube flagged it saying... And it was one of those weird things where it wasn't a copyright claim.

886
01:08:49,617 --> 01:08:51,218
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't say that somebody had claimed the copyright.

887
01:08:51,258 --> 01:08:51,738
[SPEAKER_09]: It just said...

888
01:08:52,438 --> 01:08:54,399
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't believe that this is your content.

889
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:57,340
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to prove to us that it's your content if you want to monetize it.

890
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:07,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I don't have dreams of making thousands of dollars off YouTube videos, but if I could get one of my videos to go viral and maybe pay for some new microphones for OLR, that would be awesome.

891
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:09,924
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my deal with it.

892
01:09:10,364 --> 01:09:19,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was a little pissed off to see that YouTube flagged the video for literally no reason than they want me to prove I own it.

893
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:21,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the game was Final Fantasy XIV.

894
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:34,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's listed on this wiki, or if it's not, it should be, because on Square's website, it says you can post this on our partner's site, which includes YouTube, and you can make the monetization, because it was a huge deal.

895
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,143
[SPEAKER_09]: At first, they said no monetization, and they reversed their policy.

896
01:09:38,163 --> 01:09:41,546
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a big deal a few months ago when the game first came out.

897
01:09:42,126 --> 01:09:46,408
[SPEAKER_09]: So it kind of pissed me off that YouTube flagged it for literally no reason.

898
01:09:46,548 --> 01:09:53,732
[SPEAKER_09]: And now the views that I am getting, which of course I'm going to get the most views before the patch is out, I didn't get monetization on.

899
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:57,771
[SPEAKER_09]: No, alright, so maybe I lost a quarter, but it's the principle of the thing.

900
01:09:57,891 --> 01:10:01,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm a small time channel, but what about the big time channels that this happened with?

901
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:07,320
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's just, I'm just saying, even though this wiki is out there, it's not going to stop this crap from happening.

902
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:11,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let me let Loki, because I know Loki has some more things to elaborate on this with.

903
01:10:11,724 --> 01:10:16,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, though, it's good that someone's taking the time to at least put the information out there.

904
01:10:16,661 --> 01:10:17,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

905
01:10:17,722 --> 01:10:25,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's good to know where people stand and to be able to easily educate yourself before you get into the Let's Play business.

906
01:10:26,146 --> 01:10:28,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And that it's a wiki, people can update it too.

907
01:10:28,347 --> 01:10:30,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is the community.

908
01:10:31,629 --> 01:10:33,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

909
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:43,695
[SPEAKER_07]: YouTube, of course, making a comment regarding this whole fiasco, I guess, and pretty much just sticking by their content ID system.

910
01:10:44,135 --> 01:10:44,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And

911
01:10:44,485 --> 01:10:46,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had helpful tips, of course, that's great.

912
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:54,402
[SPEAKER_07]: So they basically said, last week we expanded the system to scan more channels, including those affiliated with multi-channel networks.

913
01:10:55,469 --> 01:11:02,232
[SPEAKER_07]: As a result, some channels, including many gaming channels, saw claims appear against their videos from audio or video copyright holders.

914
01:11:02,632 --> 01:11:09,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, one video may contain multiple copyrighted works, and any of which can potentially result in a claim.

915
01:11:10,376 --> 01:11:14,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Online rights are often resold to companies like music labels and aggregators.

916
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:19,960
[SPEAKER_07]: While you might not recognize the owner, this doesn't necessarily mean their claim is invalid.

917
01:11:20,951 --> 01:11:23,412
[SPEAKER_07]: and know that we love what you do.

918
01:11:23,552 --> 01:11:32,797
[SPEAKER_07]: We've worked hard to design the content ID and other tools to give everyone from individual creators to media companies the opportunity to make great videos and money.

919
01:11:35,918 --> 01:11:48,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that didn't really help except for the fact that it's monetizing people's videos that really fall under fair use and this is the whole thing where you're having a robot do a human's job and

920
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:50,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a big old mess.

921
01:11:51,066 --> 01:12:01,593
[SPEAKER_07]: But to kind of help along with that, there is a brand new non-profit resource that's kind of based off that whole Who Let's Play.

922
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:12,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they're doing is allowing, I guess, some support for people that may have been flagged by the content ID system.

923
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:16,543
[SPEAKER_07]: And their brand new website knows the website will have some legal...

924
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:25,615
[SPEAKER_07]: or standard legal language that will be available to everyone to use and educate them on these legal minefields in a simple and clear way.

925
01:12:26,415 --> 01:12:38,880
[SPEAKER_07]: We also like to create some badges much like Creative Commons does that go along with the licensed materials which developers can use to advertise on what legal grounds they stand on advertising that their music is safe to use.

926
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:44,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically just kind of going along the lines of that Who Let's Play wiki resource

927
01:12:46,108 --> 01:13:06,028
[SPEAKER_07]: but expanding it from not just game content but to music resources and stuff like that because there were some people that were actually getting their videos flagged because they had purchased music libraries and they were using some of this music that they licensed in their videos and now those are being flagged by the original...

928
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Music Owner and stuff like that.

929
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:17,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, am I correct in thinking that because it says it has online legal resources and language, they'll have templates that I can actually use in contesting my videos?

930
01:13:17,988 --> 01:13:18,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think so.

931
01:13:18,589 --> 01:13:18,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

932
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:32,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So next time we get an episode of Orange Lounge Radio flagged as we don't believe you own this content, I can paste language in there that will get that turned over as opposed to denied, which happened this past week.

933
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Told by YouTube, we do not own the show.

934
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:36,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

935
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:38,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

936
01:13:40,013 --> 01:13:50,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and then last but not least, there was also this issue with some of the music from Terry Kavanaugh's VVV.

937
01:13:51,081 --> 01:14:03,190
[SPEAKER_07]: It was being claimed by some company called TuneCore, and the whole situation with that, I guess, is that TuneCore, as well as InMusic, they are...

938
01:14:04,622 --> 01:14:29,307
[SPEAKER_07]: partnered, I guess, he maybe had his music going through InMusic and what TuneCore has done is actually helped with the monetization and getting these videos that have their music monetized if it's not the original artists and stuff and also getting them onto different platforms including iTunes and stuff like that.

939
01:14:29,727 --> 01:14:33,628
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is though, they're I guess going to only whitelist

940
01:14:35,161 --> 01:14:54,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess now they're going to only whitelist those tracks for the original author, but for example, if the creator of VVV wants to allow other people use their gameplay footage in Let's Play videos and stuff, they're not going to authorize, or TuneCore's not going to authorize them

941
01:14:55,131 --> 01:15:02,673
[SPEAKER_07]: To make money off those videos, they're basically going to collect all the money from it and give only a portion of it to the original copyright owner.

942
01:15:03,293 --> 01:15:05,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of a mess there as well.

943
01:15:05,554 --> 01:15:08,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So why on earth would I want to sign up for this TuneCore thing in the first place?

944
01:15:09,555 --> 01:15:09,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

945
01:15:11,535 --> 01:15:12,315
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the benefit?

946
01:15:12,376 --> 01:15:14,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Why did the VVV guy sign up with this in the first place?

947
01:15:14,796 --> 01:15:17,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he thought he was going to get protected and instead...

948
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:35,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was more of like just maybe to get the soundtracks up on different, you know, music, you know, networks out there and, you know, iTunes and, you know, wherever else that's being played through and maybe get monetization from that.

949
01:15:35,602 --> 01:15:38,566
[SPEAKER_07]: But he probably never thought that it would come back to bite him on YouTube.

950
01:15:40,543 --> 01:15:53,955
[SPEAKER_08]: The role of a publisher in this scenario, exactly like Loki just said, is that you turn your materials into one source and they go quite literally everywhere, still offering you the control of where you actually want them to be.

951
01:15:54,496 --> 01:15:59,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazon MP3, iTunes, Spotify, Rdio, Pandora, CD Baby, etc.

952
01:15:59,471 --> 01:15:59,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

953
01:16:00,192 --> 01:16:00,772
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it now.

954
01:16:01,072 --> 01:16:02,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby's clarifying in chat as well.

955
01:16:03,013 --> 01:16:05,535
[SPEAKER_09]: TuneCore gets you on Spotify, iTunes, etc.

956
01:16:05,835 --> 01:16:07,957
[SPEAKER_09]: They're one of the easier music distribution companies.

957
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:08,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

958
01:16:08,417 --> 01:16:08,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

959
01:16:08,617 --> 01:16:18,904
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an artist friend of mine that lives near back home showed me some of the analytics that they get and it's really impressive.

960
01:16:18,924 --> 01:16:28,551
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a per network breakdown of where they've been making money so much so that not only is there iTunes revenue but there's iTunes match revenue which is

961
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:29,692
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

962
01:16:49,460 --> 01:17:00,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand the benefit, and until... It's so hard as an individual to work with every single one of those outlets, so I understand the middleman in this particular scenario for now.

963
01:17:01,628 --> 01:17:18,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Things might change if services actually get to a point where they give the individual artist or group, what have you, more thorough control easier, or if people just want to do it all individually so they own all the terms and do not have these conflicts.

964
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,121
[SPEAKER_08]: People are going to start learning and that might be something that has to happen now.

965
01:17:22,241 --> 01:17:30,024
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's only easier every single day to put your music somewhere on your own, to put your music on a network somewhere on your own.

966
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:32,745
[SPEAKER_08]: That said, these services exist for a reason.

967
01:17:33,025 --> 01:17:38,307
[SPEAKER_08]: They solve a lot of problems for people that are out there to get their name out there and reap the benefit of it.

968
01:17:39,699 --> 01:17:45,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, all I know is that this YouTube stuff is growing thin on the community as a whole real quick.

969
01:17:45,841 --> 01:17:51,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know there's some people out there that are like, well, people are going to just keep going to YouTube because it's the only place for it.

970
01:17:51,664 --> 01:18:01,847
[SPEAKER_09]: But when some competitors start coming out and start doing it better, I'm sure somebody at Twitch TV is thinking right now, how can we turn this into a situation that's better for ourselves and our market share?

971
01:18:02,488 --> 01:18:02,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

972
01:18:03,508 --> 01:18:09,954
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't think people will abandon ship en masse when something better comes along, Myspace would like to welcome you back.

973
01:18:10,074 --> 01:18:10,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

974
01:18:11,716 --> 01:18:13,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Justin Timberlake owns us now.

975
01:18:13,157 --> 01:18:13,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

976
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:14,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on back.

977
01:18:14,438 --> 01:18:14,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Myspace.

978
01:18:14,978 --> 01:18:15,439
[SPEAKER_09]: We're cool.

979
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:19,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I do very easily think that people will go somewhere better.

980
01:18:20,143 --> 01:18:24,727
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as YouTube going away is not going to happen.

981
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:26,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Myspace didn't go away.

982
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:29,390
[SPEAKER_08]: That's up for debate.

983
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:30,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Friendster's still around.

984
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:32,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that actually the case?

985
01:18:32,031 --> 01:18:33,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I think.

986
01:18:34,351 --> 01:18:35,312
[SPEAKER_08]: It's big in Asia, I think.

987
01:18:35,572 --> 01:18:36,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Orkut's big in Brazil.

988
01:18:39,433 --> 01:18:40,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Will a better network exist?

989
01:18:41,473 --> 01:18:42,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.

990
01:18:43,854 --> 01:18:47,215
[SPEAKER_08]: But the benefit of YouTube is that millions of eyeballs are there.

991
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:53,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and plus, for better or worse, YouTube has, at least if nothing else, all the archive stuff.

992
01:18:53,551 --> 01:18:54,431
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got so much stuff on there.

993
01:18:54,692 --> 01:19:02,097
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think as far as gamers moving, I think the gaming community may absolutely move somewhere else, especially if a targeted gaming YouTube comes out.

994
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:04,158
[SPEAKER_09]: But then the question is, who would advertise on it?

995
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:08,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Because keep in mind, that's what this is all about, is advertiser and who you see advertiser dollars.

996
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:10,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Every single one of the publishers.

997
01:19:10,282 --> 01:19:13,344
[SPEAKER_09]: If Twitch TV can exist, a gaming YouTube can exist as well.

998
01:19:13,364 --> 01:19:13,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

999
01:19:14,585 --> 01:19:44,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I absolutely agree with that aspect things somebody can make can build a better service and they will if PornTube exists well the other thing too is I'm surprised that a company like TuneCore or InMusic or whatever doesn't have a way I'm sure they did it on purpose but doesn't have a way to say okay I don't want you to worry about monetizing music on YouTube I only want it on iTunes and wherever Stitcher or wherever it's going

1000
01:19:45,207 --> 01:19:48,729
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so if, you know, they could somehow get around it that way.

1001
01:19:48,769 --> 01:19:55,714
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, now that they know that they can make money off of, you know, you know, flagging these things, of course, now they're not going to have that loophole in there.

1002
01:19:57,135 --> 01:19:59,576
[SPEAKER_09]: And TuneCore wants to make their money too, right?

1003
01:20:00,076 --> 01:20:00,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1004
01:20:00,457 --> 01:20:01,237
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how they do it.

1005
01:20:03,638 --> 01:20:09,002
[SPEAKER_08]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase SHADOW.

1006
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:10,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

1007
01:20:11,068 --> 01:20:13,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure lots of other thoughts on this.

1008
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:16,410
[SPEAKER_09]: We might get some emails on it in the next week, but for now, let's move on with the show.

1009
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:17,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason?

1010
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:22,512
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not the classic game of the week, but think back to 1993 with me.

1011
01:20:24,704 --> 01:20:48,847
[SPEAKER_08]: DOS was the preeminent IBM operating system Windows 95 was still being built I guess early days of AOL My 386 SX-16 was the bomb We still had these things called floppy disks Because nuts to optical media Calling into BBSs to play The Pit So was I And don't copy that floppy

1012
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:55,866
[SPEAKER_08]: and a wonderful little game from LucasArts called X-Wing was released.

1013
01:20:56,566 --> 01:21:10,555
[SPEAKER_08]: The first in a series of three games that pretty much set the standard for space dogfights and bolstered by Wing Commander and plenty of other games at the time.

1014
01:21:11,903 --> 01:21:20,485
[SPEAKER_08]: If you miss those days, like I do, 2014 is going to be an amazing year because of the announcement of Star Wars Attack Squadrons.

1015
01:21:22,585 --> 01:21:33,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Area 52, in conjunction with Disney and LucasArts, are going to publish an up to 16-person multiplayer space battles game under the name Star Wars Attack Squadrons.

1016
01:21:34,308 --> 01:21:39,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, please, please go to StarWars.com slash AttackSquadrons and sign up for the beta now.

1017
01:21:40,234 --> 01:21:44,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this game is going to be out in, they're saying currently, the first half of next year.

1018
01:21:44,898 --> 01:21:46,459
[SPEAKER_08]: It is going to be amazing.

1019
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:59,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though Star Wars Old Republic got its space flight off rails and actually starting battles, there is room for a dedicated game of this caliber.

1020
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:01,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait.

1021
01:22:01,652 --> 01:22:03,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I have nothing else.

1022
01:22:03,634 --> 01:22:04,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I have plenty of other things to say.

1023
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:06,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Oculus Rift would make this amazing.

1024
01:22:06,938 --> 01:22:08,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to go get a flight stick joystick.

1025
01:22:09,141 --> 01:22:12,004
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is going to be outstanding.

1026
01:22:12,685 --> 01:22:18,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Considering that it is actually going to have... The only games confirmed... Sorry, the only ships confirmed right now are the X-Wing...

1027
01:22:18,852 --> 01:22:40,827
[SPEAKER_08]: and the TIE Fighter, but invariably they are going to build that out so that the Rebels have X, A, Y, and B wings, possibly also the Z-95 Headhunter from X-Wing and TIE Fighter, X-Wing versus TIE Fighter and all that, and then invariably the Imperial side will have at least the TIE Fighter, TIE Interceptor, TIE Bomber, and we'll see what else they come up with.

1028
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:42,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait.

1029
01:22:43,389 --> 01:22:43,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Period.

1030
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:45,631
[SPEAKER_08]: You're very excited.

1031
01:22:46,952 --> 01:22:52,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Tie Fighter, X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter is like... I played so many games as a kid.

1032
01:22:53,819 --> 01:22:54,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Mostly demos.

1033
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,285
[SPEAKER_08]: But Tie Fighter was that game that I got through on my own.

1034
01:23:00,086 --> 01:23:03,149
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe cheated a little bit because the cheat codes were right in the menu.

1035
01:23:03,209 --> 01:23:06,672
[SPEAKER_08]: And that game was fucking impossible if you didn't have invulnerability and infinite missiles.

1036
01:23:06,712 --> 01:23:07,313
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways...

1037
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:10,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I had so much fun with that game.

1038
01:23:10,636 --> 01:23:16,780
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they released the CD-ROM version and they had the four bonus campaign missions.

1039
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything that was built about that game had the right look.

1040
01:23:21,683 --> 01:23:23,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I am so happy to see this news again.

1041
01:23:24,685 --> 01:23:26,226
[SPEAKER_08]: People have wanted a game like this for a while.

1042
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:28,248
[SPEAKER_08]: LucasArts closing down didn't do any favors.

1043
01:23:29,789 --> 01:23:34,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Old Republic, I don't want to be attached to an MMO just to dogfight in space.

1044
01:23:35,352 --> 01:23:35,933
[SPEAKER_08]: This is good news.

1045
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:37,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I cannot wait to see what happens with it.

1046
01:23:38,804 --> 01:23:42,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Bochikawa on chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Wow, fun stuff.

1047
01:23:42,346 --> 01:23:43,847
[SPEAKER_09]: So glad they're revisiting this.

1048
01:23:44,587 --> 01:23:49,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Dungeon Buster says, I didn't care much for X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter though because it didn't have a single player campaign.

1049
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:49,350
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1050
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:50,530
[SPEAKER_08]: It did.

1051
01:23:50,851 --> 01:23:53,772
[SPEAKER_08]: It had a single player campaign.

1052
01:23:53,812 --> 01:23:54,533
[SPEAKER_08]: It had a story.

1053
01:23:54,593 --> 01:24:01,776
[SPEAKER_08]: You had to examine ships and take out defense platforms and escort the Emperor.

1054
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:03,597
[SPEAKER_08]: There was very much a campaign.

1055
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:04,718
Okay.

1056
01:24:05,698 --> 01:24:24,806
[SPEAKER_09]: alright well I hope these renaissance type games do well and lead way to other things I wasn't super into the Star Wars games I know some people were well I like Super Star Wars on Super Nintendo that was the Star Wars game I enjoyed but I did love the old Wing Commander games like Wing Commander 1 and 2 good stuff

1057
01:24:25,146 --> 01:24:45,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I ever actually owned Wing Commander, which is why it's not as prominent in my brain I played at least 3 and 4 possibly 1 or 2, I don't remember but there has been nothing like those games in over a decade now, so this is just straight up good news Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1058
01:24:47,214 --> 01:24:47,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some stuff.

1059
01:24:48,574 --> 01:24:49,335
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Hearthstone?

1060
01:24:50,395 --> 01:24:53,876
[SPEAKER_02]: People have been looking forward to it, and Blizzard has been kind of pimping it.

1061
01:24:54,036 --> 01:25:02,858
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the open beta has been delayed, and it looks like it's going to be done next month.

1062
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,638
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're holding it off.

1063
01:25:04,778 --> 01:25:09,820
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like they're doing some more testing before they do it, and they said they don't want to rush it.

1064
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:10,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't want to rush it.

1065
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it slower.

1066
01:25:13,302 --> 01:25:21,752
[SPEAKER_02]: But they did say that the invites for the closed beta have already gone out.

1067
01:25:22,092 --> 01:25:27,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have it, check your spam folder for those who signed up for it.

1068
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:50,678
[SPEAKER_09]: which by the way it's about freaking time this open beta gets here I mean I realize it's been delayed again so I mean but Hearthstone is is it's a beta I don't know why it's still in beta the game is fully functional I mean yes there's still some balance issues to be worked out but like the longer it goes on the more I stop caring about this game because it's like

1069
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:54,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need to see another freaking beta key giveaway.

1070
01:25:54,921 --> 01:25:58,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is not in this game now that doesn't want to be in it?

1071
01:25:58,343 --> 01:25:59,504
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a Google product.

1072
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:01,686
[SPEAKER_09]: You're really still not in the beta and you want it?

1073
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:03,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1074
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:07,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never quite liked card games, but it looks fun and I would not mind.

1075
01:26:08,551 --> 01:26:12,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure somebody in chat has an extra key or I think Grandpa from Horde House has one.

1076
01:26:12,874 --> 01:26:13,295
[SPEAKER_09]: We can get you.

1077
01:26:13,515 --> 01:26:16,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're saying opt-ins for the closed beta end on January 7th.

1078
01:26:18,138 --> 01:26:43,253
[SPEAKER_09]: you can opt in on Battle.net because they need to just take the freaking game live already it's a little ridiculous I don't know it's like that again it's like Google product that stays in beta forever and it's like past the joke you know Tech2030 in chat asking Hearthstone is going to be free to play right yes if you want to buy new decks though that's where they get the money is from the decks and so forth

1079
01:26:44,642 --> 01:27:02,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates Although I think this will probably be a pretty quick segment, being what week it is But let's check in anyway, Loki You get a whole bunch of coal Because there's nothing Nothing, is there anything coming out right after the holidays?

1080
01:27:02,949 --> 01:27:12,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any big, because I remember last year, we got some pretty big stuff right after the holidays Like Ni No Kuni was just like two weeks after the holidays Is there anything in 2014 looking like that?

1081
01:27:12,968 --> 01:27:23,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, the next thing in 2014 is going to be January 10th, and that's just the disc release of We Fit You, and that's it.

1082
01:27:25,035 --> 01:27:28,117
[SPEAKER_07]: The new stuff doesn't come until literally the last week of January.

1083
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be a whole lot of nothing for a few weeks now.

1084
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:33,534
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if they added a G and an H to that, it'd be We Fight You.

1085
01:27:34,855 --> 01:27:35,215
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1086
01:27:35,676 --> 01:27:40,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's travel to Japan where at least there is some news this week because Christmas is very different in Japan.

1087
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:48,506
[SPEAKER_09]: So right after you chat down on some Christmas cake, you can go out on December 26th and check out Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters.

1088
01:27:48,546 --> 01:27:50,407
[SPEAKER_09]: They are coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

1089
01:27:50,888 --> 01:27:51,628
[SPEAKER_12]: What can I do for you?

1090
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:55,711
[SPEAKER_09]: They are getting it in Japan a little bit before we are.

1091
01:27:56,892 --> 01:27:57,333
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm...

1092
01:27:57,873 --> 01:27:59,594
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 3 is region free, right?

1093
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:01,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of you guys might be importing that.

1094
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:02,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1095
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:06,177
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also check out Ampersand or And.

1096
01:28:06,358 --> 01:28:06,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1097
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,979
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the title is like an ampersand.

1098
01:28:09,019 --> 01:28:15,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Sora no Muko de Sakimasu yo ni in regular and limited edition.

1099
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So cutesy game.

1100
01:28:17,703 --> 01:28:20,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks like, you know, happy.

1101
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:20,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1102
01:28:20,765 --> 01:28:22,606
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is the title of the game is like an ampersand.

1103
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:25,007
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if that's like a is that an anime that I don't know of?

1104
01:28:25,368 --> 01:28:26,068
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.

1105
01:28:26,377 --> 01:28:26,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1106
01:28:44,804 --> 01:28:48,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Checking out some of the other consoles on the Xbox 360.

1107
01:28:48,867 --> 01:28:49,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Nada.

1108
01:28:49,688 --> 01:28:50,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing this week.

1109
01:28:50,869 --> 01:28:57,333
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PlayStation Vita, the Ampersand game is there too, as well as the 10 and 10.2 HD remasters are there as well.

1110
01:28:57,994 --> 01:29:05,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's also, I believe, a special box set with the PlayStation Vita and the 10 and 10.2 all coming together.

1111
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:06,439
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is on the PlayStation Vita.

1112
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,261
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Wii U this week, nothing.

1113
01:29:09,341 --> 01:29:12,364
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is an accessory for Wii Karaoke U coming out on December 31st.

1114
01:29:13,084 --> 01:29:14,585
[SPEAKER_09]: A little mini speaker system.

1115
01:29:16,245 --> 01:29:20,667
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 3DS, A Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Worlds makes its way to Japan this week.

1116
01:29:20,787 --> 01:29:22,228
[SPEAKER_09]: That was one that we got first.

1117
01:29:22,628 --> 01:29:27,030
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are getting that extra little console bundle that we got here as well.

1118
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,971
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I want to see, does it look the exact same?

1119
01:29:29,471 --> 01:29:32,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious because I actually haven't seen what the Japanese one looks like.

1120
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:35,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is the exact same bundle we got here except the box art's way better.

1121
01:29:36,674 --> 01:29:37,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that box art way better.

1122
01:29:38,931 --> 01:29:55,408
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's that same 3DS except of course it is a Japanese 3DS because you know they're region locked and stuff and lastly on the PSP this week Julik Nightmare in regular and limited edition as well as Sengoku Hime 4 comes out this week on the PSP

1123
01:29:56,977 --> 01:29:59,398
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1124
01:30:18,593 --> 01:30:26,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually been chatting off and on with CatastrophicMagi and he was telling me not too long ago about playing Strider on the Spectrum.

1125
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:27,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1126
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:31,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, hey Dan, you want to play Strider on the Spectrum?

1127
01:30:31,663 --> 01:30:33,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan's like, no.

1128
01:30:35,106 --> 01:30:38,248
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of those things that probably sounds more fun than it really is.

1129
01:30:38,288 --> 01:30:39,149
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I want?

1130
01:30:39,329 --> 01:30:40,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Rose-colored retro glasses.

1131
01:30:40,249 --> 01:30:46,034
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would love to get for my house is a Duo RX so that we can use an arcade card

1132
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:56,517
[SPEAKER_02]: or have a converter that we can use an arcade card with on our duo because we can't play his version of Strider for the PC Engine without using an arcade card.

1133
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course the pin sets are different.

1134
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:00,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway.

1135
01:31:03,462 --> 01:31:08,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, Loki.

1136
01:31:09,326 --> 01:31:14,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so of course everyone wants to know what was the most played game in 2013?

1137
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:44,512
[SPEAKER_07]: and Raptor has the answer for that they broke down the top 5 games of course number 1 being my personal favorite Grand Theft Auto 5 followed by Call of Duty Ghosts on Xbox 360 and actually Grand Theft Auto 5 on 360 was number 1 Battlefield 4 on PC Dota 2 on PC and last but not least Final Fantasy 14 Online Realm Reborn on PC

1138
01:31:46,377 --> 01:31:48,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, I didn't realize Realm Reborn was that high.

1139
01:31:48,938 --> 01:31:55,281
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm also surprised that World of Warcraft, League of Legends, where are those games?

1140
01:31:55,861 --> 01:32:00,823
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually those most played that was based on a 30-day launch window.

1141
01:32:00,843 --> 01:32:02,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So actually the most played...

1142
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:06,371
[SPEAKER_07]: PC Game of 2013 was League of Legends Let's log back into Xbox 360 Voice then

1143
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:28,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the whole thing is just like, you know, like achievements.

1144
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:29,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

1145
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:31,412
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's just kind of like, oh, damn it.

1146
01:32:31,532 --> 01:32:33,814
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Rob's outperforming me in this game.

1147
01:32:33,834 --> 01:32:35,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go play this game some more.

1148
01:32:35,515 --> 01:32:36,556
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically it.

1149
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:38,197
[SPEAKER_09]: It's up-to-the-minute EPing.

1150
01:32:38,337 --> 01:32:39,718
[SPEAKER_09]: 24 hours, 7 days a week EPing.

1151
01:32:39,818 --> 01:32:41,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cross-network leaderboards.

1152
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:43,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1153
01:32:43,381 --> 01:32:45,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a Raptor account, I'm pretty sure.

1154
01:32:45,263 --> 01:32:48,426
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably tracks my 360 progress, but you know.

1155
01:32:49,086 --> 01:32:50,628
[SPEAKER_08]: When's the last time you turned that thing on?

1156
01:32:50,688 --> 01:32:51,849
[SPEAKER_09]: This week when I played Minecraft.

1157
01:32:51,969 --> 01:32:52,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, not so bad.

1158
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:53,890
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about that, weren't we?

1159
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:54,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, weren't you paying attention?

1160
01:32:54,991 --> 01:32:55,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1161
01:32:55,952 --> 01:32:57,894
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually taking notes for the video.

1162
01:32:57,914 --> 01:32:59,115
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my legal excuse here.

1163
01:32:59,415 --> 01:33:00,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Minecraft.

1164
01:33:00,335 --> 01:33:01,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine all the things.

1165
01:33:02,236 --> 01:33:02,656
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1166
01:33:02,696 --> 01:33:03,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have to say something else funny.

1167
01:33:03,856 --> 01:33:04,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Side note.

1168
01:33:05,097 --> 01:33:10,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Julian, when I picked him up from school on Friday, he said, Can I play Minecraft at your house?

1169
01:33:11,278 --> 01:33:11,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said no.

1170
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:13,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've uninstalled it.

1171
01:33:13,899 --> 01:33:16,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember when you hated Minecraft, but you finally came around.

1172
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:17,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, that was some progress in 2013.

1173
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,161
[SPEAKER_09]: You finally came around to lukewarm on Minecraft.

1174
01:33:20,808 --> 01:33:22,569
[SPEAKER_02]: CallDutyBlackOps2, GrandTheftAuto5

1175
01:33:41,107 --> 01:33:42,049
[SPEAKER_07]: and then Minecraft.

1176
01:33:42,329 --> 01:33:43,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was interesting.

1177
01:33:44,514 --> 01:33:51,707
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that Grand Theft Auto 5 could jump up that high in gameplay hours for the last two and a half months of the year compared to everything else

1178
01:33:52,831 --> 01:33:55,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Not surprising, but kind of crazy.

1179
01:34:20,551 --> 01:34:27,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really know how to condense this into, but if you somehow don't know the controversy with Penny Arcade Expo, let me just put it this way.

1180
01:34:27,618 --> 01:34:33,744
[SPEAKER_09]: The guys behind it have a tendency to put their foot in their mouths every time.

1181
01:34:33,884 --> 01:34:38,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Just when you think they might have learned something, they stick their foot right back in their mouth with some other comment.

1182
01:34:39,369 --> 01:34:44,194
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really turned some people or rubbed some people the wrong way with Penny Arcade Expo.

1183
01:34:44,214 --> 01:34:48,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's definitely a call where they need to do the right thing and they need to get the message out there.

1184
01:34:48,959 --> 01:34:57,067
[SPEAKER_09]: And they need to be a little more accepting of all types of gaming cultures and so forth.

1185
01:34:57,687 --> 01:34:58,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And anyhow...

1186
01:34:59,449 --> 01:35:00,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Some plans came out this week.

1187
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:02,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Some leaked plans or whatever.

1188
01:35:02,372 --> 01:35:07,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Some leaked information came out this week about Penny Arcade's planned diversity hub and lounge.

1189
01:35:08,098 --> 01:35:08,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

1190
01:35:09,059 --> 01:35:09,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1191
01:35:09,379 --> 01:35:09,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not done.

1192
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:10,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1193
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:18,409
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be something that would be in a high-traffic PAX area that would be a resource for PAX attendees to find information related to issues surrounding women.

1194
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:24,675
[SPEAKER_09]: LGBTQ, people of color, disabled people, mental health issues in gaming.

1195
01:35:25,435 --> 01:35:35,265
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be a resource for industry professionals and fans to interface in a setting focused on diversity, receive diversity training, learn more about diversity, and meet people from diverse communities.

1196
01:35:35,805 --> 01:35:38,308
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, this was all mocked on Twitter in an instance.

1197
01:35:38,808 --> 01:35:42,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Hashtag diversity lounge drinks, things of that nature.

1198
01:35:44,773 --> 01:35:49,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, some folks kind of saying like, wow, they are literally shoving all of this in the corner.

1199
01:35:51,155 --> 01:35:51,775
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

1200
01:35:51,815 --> 01:35:53,476
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of mixed feedback going on this.

1201
01:35:53,776 --> 01:35:58,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't know if this is what PAX will actually end up implementing or whatever.

1202
01:35:58,578 --> 01:36:00,458
[SPEAKER_09]: But PAX East is coming up before we know it.

1203
01:36:01,419 --> 01:36:03,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I made a decision not to go to PAX East.

1204
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:05,800
[SPEAKER_09]: That's rooted mostly in finance.

1205
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,681
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was a small part of that where I was just like, you know what?

1206
01:36:10,054 --> 01:36:10,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Pax does a lot of panels.

1207
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:11,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not...

1208
01:36:37,728 --> 01:36:38,429
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1209
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:25,082
[SPEAKER_09]: but what about something that builds awareness to maybe one of these causes as a booth that's out there on the show floor you know what about some great gaming charities that could be out there on the show floor really getting their information out there to maybe some of the people that need to hear it most it is a little weird to hear that they want to like kind of put it in its own room I don't know any thoughts on this from you guys here in studio or Loki on phone

1210
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:26,521
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1211
01:37:45,093 --> 01:37:49,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's too little too late and if they're really going about it the wrong way.

1212
01:37:49,476 --> 01:37:52,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see the public booth.

1213
01:37:52,798 --> 01:37:56,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see something right available at every corner.

1214
01:37:57,081 --> 01:37:58,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's where you can get your information.

1215
01:37:59,503 --> 01:38:09,149
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole thing reminds me of The Office when Michael would try to have a diversity day and stuff and it just goes horribly wrong.

1216
01:38:09,169 --> 01:38:11,891
[SPEAKER_07]: They completely offend everybody in the process.

1217
01:38:12,651 --> 01:38:13,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like that.

1218
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:18,700
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a part of me, I gotta be honest, there's a part of me that's like, you know what, they don't...

1219
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:25,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe this is a controversial thing I'm about to say, so feel free to present your viewpoint respectfully if you think I'm wrong.

1220
01:38:25,493 --> 01:38:27,454
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just kind of like, you know, there's a part of me that thinks, you know what?

1221
01:38:27,754 --> 01:38:29,635
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't really need to even do this.

1222
01:38:30,175 --> 01:38:36,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Just don't go out of your way to be all like, yay, we're going to have diversity day and hold hands.

1223
01:38:36,498 --> 01:38:43,580
[SPEAKER_09]: How about you apologize for what you said and mean it and just show through your actions in the future?

1224
01:38:43,881 --> 01:38:44,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1225
01:38:44,561 --> 01:38:45,701
[SPEAKER_09]: That would mean so much more.

1226
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:47,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that would be too difficult, Rob.

1227
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:50,142
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the honest thing at the end of the day.

1228
01:38:50,242 --> 01:38:51,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need a room.

1229
01:38:51,743 --> 01:38:55,726
[SPEAKER_09]: I just need your actions to show that you care.

1230
01:38:58,087 --> 01:38:59,108
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's enough for me.

1231
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:05,151
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, if they do this, they don't have to change their behavior.

1232
01:39:06,352 --> 01:39:08,033
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making their token effort.

1233
01:39:08,093 --> 01:39:09,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what bugs me about it.

1234
01:39:09,974 --> 01:39:15,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Ranma wants to remind us in chat at live.vognetwork.com, it was a leaked memo, things might change.

1235
01:39:15,156 --> 01:39:16,137
[SPEAKER_09]: That's absolutely right.

1236
01:39:16,777 --> 01:39:21,059
[SPEAKER_09]: SSG100Matt says, tinfoil hat time, I wonder if they leaked it on purpose to see the reaction.

1237
01:39:21,919 --> 01:39:24,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Queen Simia says, it's tokenism, I think.

1238
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:27,502
[SPEAKER_09]: See, we're not totally sexist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynist.

1239
01:39:27,762 --> 01:39:29,603
[SPEAKER_09]: We put a room just for them over there.

1240
01:39:30,523 --> 01:39:31,684
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I'm just like, you know what?

1241
01:39:31,744 --> 01:39:37,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you just show through your actions you're not that way and then just have a gaming convention and we're good.

1242
01:39:38,448 --> 01:39:51,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be fair, most corporations, especially a lot of the ones that you are going to have on the floor at your convention, have diversity training as part of their corporate training.

1243
01:39:52,575 --> 01:39:54,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how this goes, right?

1244
01:39:54,076 --> 01:39:54,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

1245
01:39:55,096 --> 01:39:56,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working, I worked for...

1246
01:39:58,138 --> 01:40:22,255
[SPEAKER_02]: what was the money store for like 10 years and we had freaking diversity training damn near every year especially if you're in customer service but yeah it's it's just it's I I'm at a loss because I want to say five different words at one time to describe it and none of them want to come to the fore so I'm just gonna say it's fuckery and leave it at that

1247
01:40:24,006 --> 01:40:25,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, any final thoughts on this?

1248
01:40:25,846 --> 01:40:27,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I had exactly the same thought.

1249
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:43,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I had exactly the same point as you in that this seems exceedingly unnecessary when it's not born out of... The big story at the last PAX was not this born out of confrontation on the show floor or something between attendees.

1250
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:49,571
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the fucking founder that was making stupid comments.

1251
01:40:49,611 --> 01:40:52,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't it also outside, just on the internet, not even...

1252
01:40:53,312 --> 01:41:03,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember if it happened a day of the show or shortly after or something like that, but it's like, one, he literally pulled a sorry not sorry on stage, basically.

1253
01:41:04,597 --> 01:41:07,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't remember that portion of it.

1254
01:41:07,178 --> 01:41:12,340
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my impression of it anyway, is that, you know, oh, I said sorry for this once, but I'm really not sorry.

1255
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry I got caught.

1256
01:41:13,948 --> 01:41:15,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is, I don't know, anyway.

1257
01:41:16,089 --> 01:41:19,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Or my favorite thing, I'm sorry my words offended you.

1258
01:41:20,671 --> 01:41:24,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means I'm not sorry for what I said, I'm just sorry that you called me on it.

1259
01:41:25,054 --> 01:41:27,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's your problem, not mine.

1260
01:41:27,735 --> 01:41:29,536
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems foolish, it seems unnecessary.

1261
01:41:29,856 --> 01:41:36,239
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely is putting the problem, quotey fingers, into a corner.

1262
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:37,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1263
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:38,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, whatever.

1264
01:41:40,203 --> 01:41:42,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

1265
01:41:42,526 --> 01:41:48,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to a time when gaming was just... It didn't have all this fuckery, as Jamie put it.

1266
01:41:48,453 --> 01:41:50,736
[SPEAKER_09]: It also didn't have all this diversity, but that's another topic.

1267
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:51,877
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1268
01:41:52,338 --> 01:41:55,682
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because everybody in video games was Japanese.

1269
01:41:56,661 --> 01:41:58,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1270
01:42:17,535 --> 01:42:20,037
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1271
01:42:40,336 --> 01:42:48,599
[SPEAKER_02]: which we got it over here with one of the Namco Museum games as the Genji and Heike clan.

1272
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:53,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And over there it was the Genji and Heike tale of the demon's demise.

1273
01:42:54,782 --> 01:42:57,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a side-scrolling action game that came out by Namco.

1274
01:42:57,983 --> 01:43:03,525
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an arcade game in 1986 and it ran on the Namco System 86 hardware.

1275
01:43:04,006 --> 01:43:06,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, we got it over here as the Namco Museum Vol. 4.

1276
01:43:07,608 --> 01:43:09,571
[SPEAKER_02]: or it was The Sea, which I have it.

1277
01:43:09,591 --> 01:43:11,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game's actually kind of a neat little game.

1278
01:43:12,074 --> 01:43:22,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like it from an artistic point of view because the game sort of plays like you're on a Yamatoid type landscape.

1279
01:43:22,169 --> 01:43:23,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like

1280
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:32,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like it's trying to emulate some of the ancient artwork of Japan pre the popularity of the woodblock stuff that a lot of people are used to.

1281
01:43:34,628 --> 01:43:39,092
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as you go through the game, you have different types of action.

1282
01:43:39,112 --> 01:43:40,633
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the small mode, which is standard.

1283
01:43:40,773 --> 01:43:43,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Big mode, with large characters and...

1284
01:43:45,657 --> 01:43:52,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Boss Fights, and then you have a playing mode, which is overhead.

1285
01:43:52,882 --> 01:44:01,808
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a torii, which are used to transport you to a different stage, and most stages are featured in the side mode or playing mode.

1286
01:44:02,729 --> 01:44:06,671
[SPEAKER_02]: There are multiple torii that can be entered that will take to different routes on the map.

1287
01:44:06,751 --> 01:44:09,693
[SPEAKER_02]: In big mode, there's only one, and it's at the end of the stage.

1288
01:44:11,114 --> 01:44:25,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are playing a historical samurai named Taira no Kagekiyo, which is basically, he died in the battle of Dan no Ura at the end of the Genpei War.

1289
01:44:26,277 --> 01:44:32,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was resurrected in this to fight Minamoto no Yoshitsune, I've got a lot of Japanese in this,

1290
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:42,543
[SPEAKER_02]: and Saito Musashi Bulbenke over the Imperial Regalia of Japan, which is the only way to beat Minamoto no Yoritomo.

1291
01:44:43,604 --> 01:44:59,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got a lot of different elements of Japanese history and mythology in it, including the Sanzu River, which separates the current life from the afterlife, sort of like the river Styx in Greek mythology.

1292
01:45:00,251 --> 01:45:09,235
[SPEAKER_02]: and different mythological characters like Emo who or Emadayo who is the king of the god of the underworld and Amaterasu who is the sun goddess.

1293
01:45:09,935 --> 01:45:11,556
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been many different versions of it.

1294
01:45:11,616 --> 01:45:13,077
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1988 we had the Sharp X68000 home computer.

1295
01:45:17,839 --> 01:45:43,228
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was very very much like the arcade version we have a PC Engine version that came out on March 16th 1990 and the PC Engine version has been released on the Wii's Virtual Console as I said earlier it was released in the US on Namco Museum Volume 4 as the Genji and Heike clans which is probably about the closest

1296
01:45:45,638 --> 01:45:49,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say translation to the name, but we could have gotten over here.

1297
01:45:50,684 --> 01:45:55,709
[SPEAKER_02]: There also was an interactive board game that was based off this that used a Famicom cartridge for play.

1298
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:57,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was called... Sounds weird.

1299
01:45:57,791 --> 01:46:00,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Genpei Toumaiden Computer Board Game.

1300
01:46:00,254 --> 01:46:01,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out on October 21st.

1301
01:46:01,275 --> 01:46:02,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like the Pac-Man board game?

1302
01:46:02,997 --> 01:46:04,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no freaking clue.

1303
01:46:04,419 --> 01:46:05,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to find this.

1304
01:46:05,159 --> 01:46:06,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd really like to see it.

1305
01:46:06,821 --> 01:46:15,148
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also a sequel called Genpei Toma Den Kanno Ki that came out April 7, 1992 exclusively for the PC Engine.

1306
01:46:16,008 --> 01:46:25,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did have an American release that was called Samurai Ghost for TurboGrafx-16 and it is the only one of the games that had been released outside Japan before Namco Museum Vol. 4.

1307
01:46:28,518 --> 01:46:31,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Kagekiyo has shown up in other games done by Namco.

1308
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:44,565
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a playable character in the WonderSwan color game Namco Super Wars and in Namco Cross Capcom, which he teamed up with Mitsurugi from the Soul series and Tarosuke from Shadowland.

1309
01:46:45,766 --> 01:47:00,385
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of the other characters have appeared in it and our most recent one was of course Tyra has been in Namco High as one of the dateable characters which I'm probably going to play him next.

1310
01:47:01,185 --> 01:47:05,547
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of the game music was actually remixed for Ridge Racer 5.

1311
01:47:05,687 --> 01:47:06,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

1312
01:47:06,667 --> 01:47:07,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

1313
01:47:09,008 --> 01:47:10,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a fun game.

1314
01:47:10,569 --> 01:47:12,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're watching it right now.

1315
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:14,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see the shape of the clouds?

1316
01:47:15,631 --> 01:47:21,854
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the biggest thing that indicated that art style to me and then when I went and found it actually confirmed, I was like, yes, I recognize the art style.

1317
01:47:21,934 --> 01:47:23,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta be honest, I have never seen this game before.

1318
01:47:24,174 --> 01:47:24,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.

1319
01:47:24,495 --> 01:47:24,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Never.

1320
01:47:25,715 --> 01:47:29,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was in some Namco collections, I just do not remember it at all.

1321
01:47:29,337 --> 01:47:33,940
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would like at some point, I'm more than happy to bring over the sea from my Namco collection.

1322
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:35,520
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun game.

1323
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:36,701
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is fun.

1324
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:39,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have a billion other classics I gotta play too.

1325
01:47:40,463 --> 01:47:41,904
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting platformer.

1326
01:47:42,044 --> 01:47:47,307
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the imagery in this has reminded me of an old arcade game called Sengoku that I played a handful of times.

1327
01:47:47,687 --> 01:47:53,050
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's just because Japanese classic warrior mythology and not so mythology.

1328
01:47:53,790 --> 01:48:16,332
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially with the way that the imagery is presented, the way that you have, even the dialogue is presented in game as corner, top to bottom, left to right, as traditional Japanese artwork would have had a poem or something written on it.

1329
01:48:17,212 --> 01:48:20,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, very kanji heavy too, I noticed.

1330
01:48:20,394 --> 01:48:27,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, you know, the first one I played was, you know, the English version that came out on PlayStation.

1331
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:29,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it's a good game.

1332
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:30,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good game.

1333
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:40,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Very solid, and I also just laughed my ass off at any of Tyra's scenes that I've seen on Tumblr so far, so I have to play Tyra's next.

1334
01:48:40,899 --> 01:48:41,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, there it is.

1335
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:42,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Your classic game of the week.

1336
01:48:42,362 --> 01:48:43,243
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the title one more time?

1337
01:48:44,165 --> 01:48:46,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It was... I just closed the window.

1338
01:48:47,531 --> 01:48:48,011
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't remember.

1339
01:48:48,031 --> 01:48:49,093
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Genpei Tomoden.

1340
01:48:49,434 --> 01:48:50,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Genpei Tomoden.

1341
01:48:50,255 --> 01:48:50,616
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.

1342
01:48:50,756 --> 01:48:50,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1343
01:48:51,457 --> 01:48:53,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Your classic game of the week.

1344
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:57,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably all of the correct pronunciation you're going to get out of me today.

1345
01:48:58,504 --> 01:49:02,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio coming up here on this pre-holiday edition of the show.

1346
01:49:03,207 --> 01:49:06,490
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got Rapid Fire News, a special Fugle Question of the Week tonight.

1347
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:09,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason will be reading it, we'll get into that a little later.

1348
01:49:10,053 --> 01:49:13,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And some news about Xbox One and plenty more when we come back.

1349
01:49:13,996 --> 01:49:15,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's still there on the phone, right?

1350
01:49:16,838 --> 01:49:17,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm here.

1351
01:49:17,378 --> 01:49:19,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have to check on you once in a while because I can't look at you.

1352
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they find your sister?

1353
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:21,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1354
01:49:22,185 --> 01:49:22,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

1355
01:49:23,026 --> 01:49:23,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

1356
01:49:24,006 --> 01:49:30,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not... She was working out in her goat pasture, so who knows?

1357
01:49:31,151 --> 01:49:32,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want a goat.

1358
01:49:32,451 --> 01:49:32,892
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't.

1359
01:49:32,912 --> 01:49:33,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Goats are cute.

1360
01:49:33,652 --> 01:49:34,173
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't.

1361
01:49:34,533 --> 01:49:34,873
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1362
01:49:35,253 --> 01:49:36,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I hope everything's all right with that.

1363
01:49:36,834 --> 01:49:44,299
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got plenty more Loki on the phone and plenty more folks here in studio when we come back right after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1364
01:49:51,044 --> 01:50:02,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, December the 22nd of 2013, with episode number 532 of our show in progress.

1365
01:50:03,112 --> 01:50:10,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And just in case we forget to mention it at the end of the show, I just want to wish all y'all happy holidays out there, no matter what it is you celebrate.

1366
01:50:10,496 --> 01:50:12,658
[SPEAKER_09]: You might already be done with the holidays, like Jamie is.

1367
01:50:14,059 --> 01:50:16,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Not technically done, because I live in an interfaith family.

1368
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:19,282
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true, as many people do in this day and age.

1369
01:50:19,762 --> 01:50:29,670
[SPEAKER_09]: But whatever it is you celebrate, Christmas, I'm sure many, many, many of you Festivus, Kwanzaa And the blessed solstice since it just passed Solstice was last night, right?

1370
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:48,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, Yule celebration Whatever it is y'all celebrate, have a good time And I still want a goat And thanks to all of you who have supported us through Here We Are, yet another holiday season together So thank you everybody And trust me, you don't want a goat

1371
01:50:50,475 --> 01:50:53,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want a goat so we don't have to mow the lawn ever.

1372
01:50:53,698 --> 01:50:54,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're cute.

1373
01:50:54,358 --> 01:50:55,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at their eyes.

1374
01:50:55,159 --> 01:50:56,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Their eyes are adorable.

1375
01:50:56,379 --> 01:50:57,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, that was my thought.

1376
01:50:57,820 --> 01:51:00,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Our backyard's pretty overgrown.

1377
01:51:00,082 --> 01:51:01,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, hey, just bring him over.

1378
01:51:01,483 --> 01:51:03,544
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's not that easy.

1379
01:51:04,064 --> 01:51:07,867
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the in-laws, if you have one goat, it's fine.

1380
01:51:07,927 --> 01:51:10,048
[SPEAKER_02]: They sort of turn into a dog-type pet.

1381
01:51:10,349 --> 01:51:12,130
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have two goats, they turn into assholes.

1382
01:51:12,570 --> 01:51:13,611
[SPEAKER_02]: They start plotting against you.

1383
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:16,812
[SPEAKER_07]: She has like six, and I think they had more.

1384
01:51:17,152 --> 01:51:20,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's like six or seven now that she has.

1385
01:51:20,115 --> 01:51:20,855
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ridiculous.

1386
01:51:20,935 --> 01:51:21,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Goats!

1387
01:51:21,776 --> 01:51:22,476
[SPEAKER_09]: They're so cute.

1388
01:51:22,496 --> 01:51:24,498
[SPEAKER_09]: But your sister is a veterinarian, right?

1389
01:51:25,259 --> 01:51:33,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, she does lab work at a vet tech place, but she keeps her goats at a friend of my mom's house.

1390
01:51:34,125 --> 01:51:37,528
[SPEAKER_07]: He has farm land, and so she has a pasture over there.

1391
01:51:38,526 --> 01:51:39,067
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

1392
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:43,689
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of farming in my family too, believe it or not.

1393
01:51:44,410 --> 01:51:51,134
[SPEAKER_09]: My uncle, I don't know how much I should really say about this, but my uncle is a big-time pig farmer.

1394
01:51:51,174 --> 01:51:57,018
[SPEAKER_09]: He was actually president of some big pig-related thing when swine flu broke out.

1395
01:51:57,218 --> 01:52:01,461
[SPEAKER_09]: So they interviewed him on the news and he was literally there on the... I think I talked about this when swine flu first broke.

1396
01:52:01,801 --> 01:52:03,582
[SPEAKER_09]: He was literally the guy there on the news saying...

1397
01:52:04,042 --> 01:52:13,595
[SPEAKER_09]: don't call it swine flu and you can eat as much bacon as you want it's fine you know please don't stop buying bacon because you know they're pig farmers so yeah that's that's my uncle

1398
01:52:15,476 --> 01:52:18,758
[SPEAKER_07]: All they have to say is that swine flu makes the bacon taste even better.

1399
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,081
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the family I grew up in right there.

1400
01:52:23,782 --> 01:52:29,066
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think my other uncle on my mom's side is like a rodeo guy, but I don't even know.

1401
01:52:29,186 --> 01:52:30,307
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not super close.

1402
01:52:30,487 --> 01:52:35,150
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a kid and used to go to Dothan, Alabama, and they had a little farm.

1403
01:52:36,571 --> 01:52:40,894
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually lived on the farm for like two years, so I spent two summers there, legit.

1404
01:52:41,294 --> 01:52:43,316
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had two goats and they were both named Sam.

1405
01:52:44,673 --> 01:53:08,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Both of the goats, we're named Sam Some comments in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com Fifth dream, reminding us it's Christmas Eve, Eve, Eve That is something my sister used to say on the 23rd She'd always say, it's Christmas Eve, Eve So today would be Christmas Eve, Eve, Eve Let's see, Redertainment in chat at live.vognetwork.com says Celebrate the holidays, including the new holiday December 20th, the day gay marriage came to Utah

1406
01:53:09,246 --> 01:53:36,350
[SPEAKER_02]: congratulations another state on marriage equality that's amazing and as I told you earlier today in the trying to pass a stay on it the court rejected the stay so go get hitched happy to hear it if you're ready for it if you want to don't get hitched just because you can that's like what Britney Spears does however it would be completely fair if you wanted to get really drunk and elope

1407
01:53:36,670 --> 01:53:37,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, start us off, rapid fire news

1408
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:03,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so this week we got another update for Grand Theft Auto Online.

1409
01:54:03,864 --> 01:54:07,185
[SPEAKER_07]: They added some capture-to-flag type gameplay modes.

1410
01:54:07,905 --> 01:54:09,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, with their own kind of spin to it.

1411
01:54:10,106 --> 01:54:13,467
[SPEAKER_07]: They have Raid, which is kind of like a standard capture-to-flag.

1412
01:54:13,567 --> 01:54:19,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they have bases that you can hold and packages you have to seize and stuff.

1413
01:54:19,988 --> 01:54:29,491
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also Contend, which I guess is centered around a single vehicle that you capture and have to bring back to your base.

1414
01:54:30,089 --> 01:54:58,560
[SPEAKER_07]: so fun stuff and of course the content creator stuff came out last week as well so been trying to make some stuff with that that was kind of cool Dynasty Warriors 8 Extreme Legends coming to consoles at least Sony consoles in spring 2014 of course Extreme Legends for Playstation 3 and Extreme Legends the Complete Edition for Playstation 4 and Vita

1415
01:54:59,882 --> 01:55:01,103
[SPEAKER_07]: All bases covered there.

1416
01:55:02,844 --> 01:55:13,009
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the games I forgot to mention that I played this week, a tiny little bit of, of course, just a tiny little bit, I must stress that, Cookie Clicker got a Christmas update.

1417
01:55:13,129 --> 01:55:23,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Now there's reindeer cookies that you can click on and a crazy looking Cthulhu-esque Santa and all other

1418
01:55:24,858 --> 01:55:27,479
[SPEAKER_07]: and all sorts of power-ups and stuff you can get in there as well.

1419
01:55:27,499 --> 01:55:31,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Christmas tree ornaments and all that fun stuff.

1420
01:55:31,321 --> 01:55:36,064
[SPEAKER_07]: So check it out if you've left your cookies clicking all by themselves for a while.

1421
01:55:37,184 --> 01:55:42,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And the knock-off on the iPhone cookie clicker also has Santa cookies right now.

1422
01:55:43,428 --> 01:55:48,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So just saying, with special chocolate milk mode.

1423
01:55:48,130 --> 01:55:51,132
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're playing the cheap knock-off on iPhone, there's something for you there too.

1424
01:55:51,272 --> 01:55:51,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1425
01:55:52,076 --> 01:55:54,457
[SPEAKER_07]: you have orange juice right now as my milk

1426
01:56:12,285 --> 01:56:18,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on to some other topics The game that I kind of thought NES Remix might be more like Super Mario Bros.

1427
01:56:18,567 --> 01:56:21,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Crossover But it's not Super Mario Bros.

1428
01:56:21,447 --> 01:56:27,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Crossover has a brand new 3.1 version that is out And this brings the Lost Levels into Super Mario Bros.

1429
01:56:27,989 --> 01:56:30,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Crossover You know, like the Japanese Super Mario Bros.

1430
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:35,751
[SPEAKER_09]: 2 Lost Levels So yeah, now Lost Levels will have 52 levels there with it 348 levels in the game now

1431
01:56:39,752 --> 01:56:45,735
[SPEAKER_09]: They did not change the physics, however, for Mario and Luigi, so it's not necessarily the true version, but eh, there you go.

1432
01:56:46,456 --> 01:56:48,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Whole lots of new levels there for Super Mario Bros.

1433
01:56:48,637 --> 01:56:49,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Crossover 3.1.

1434
01:56:49,517 --> 01:56:53,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played this game in a while, but it was a lot of fun the times I did check it out.

1435
01:56:54,019 --> 01:56:55,620
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, wasn't that developed here locally?

1436
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:56,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't we find that out?

1437
01:56:56,521 --> 01:56:57,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the guy who did it's in Sacramento?

1438
01:56:58,362 --> 01:56:59,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he is.

1439
01:56:59,322 --> 01:57:00,423
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta find him and get him on the show.

1440
01:57:01,983 --> 01:57:05,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Konami releasing a new version of Contra, but guess what?

1441
01:57:05,945 --> 01:57:06,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only in China.

1442
01:57:07,466 --> 01:57:08,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1443
01:57:30,612 --> 01:57:32,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, oh, hey, PC game?

1444
01:57:32,173 --> 01:57:32,754
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be pretty cool.

1445
01:57:57,068 --> 01:58:17,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe coming soon to Steam for $1.99 Speaking of Steam and things you can buy on it Typing of the Dead Overkill is half off on Steam Or at least it was during the holiday sale I don't know if that's still going But there's also a brand new DLC pack You know they've been releasing a lot of these And we keep covering it every week I don't know, this might be the last one But we have to...

1446
01:58:18,203 --> 01:58:26,688
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to mention this one because this Trump... They had Shakespeare, they had Football Manager, but this one, this is the best, you guys.

1447
01:58:26,888 --> 01:58:29,569
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the filth DLC pack.

1448
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:31,510
[SPEAKER_09]: You can now type lines like...

1449
01:58:40,796 --> 01:58:48,204
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can put in those terms into Typing of the Dead Overkill as you blast zombies to cocks.

1450
01:58:48,825 --> 01:58:50,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So check that out.

1451
01:58:50,606 --> 01:58:53,209
[SPEAKER_02]: That might sell the game for me because I like...

1452
01:58:55,171 --> 01:58:55,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1453
01:58:55,551 --> 01:58:57,373
[SPEAKER_09]: This means we need... You like cocks?

1454
01:58:57,433 --> 01:58:58,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you're saying?

1455
01:58:58,715 --> 01:58:59,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

1456
01:58:59,295 --> 01:59:03,419
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to do another Let's Play with extra for narrating.

1457
01:59:03,479 --> 01:59:05,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's going to have to be a thing there.

1458
01:59:05,181 --> 01:59:06,682
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll get that.

1459
01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:09,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe instead of Horde House this week, we'll have extra for narrating.

1460
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:11,427
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be a cunning linguist.

1461
01:59:11,747 --> 01:59:14,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it looks like right now it's only $14.99 and then the DLC is...

1462
01:59:17,096 --> 01:59:17,597
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

1463
01:59:34,477 --> 02:00:02,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Skullgirls Encore has a typing of the Skullgirls mode totally inspired by the typing of the dead you will type an on-screen word to do your super attacks if you type it correctly your attack will do 1.5 more damage than usual if right but not perfect it's regular damage and incorrect will have a 10% reduction on the damage it doesn't work online or in tournament mode so typing of Skullgirls

1464
02:00:02,894 --> 02:00:10,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, for anyone who loves to play old PlayStation games on your mobile, you can now play the original Tomb Raider and it's 99 cents.

1465
02:00:11,803 --> 02:00:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is compatible with iOS 7.0 later only for iOS.

1466
02:00:19,110 --> 02:00:23,594
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, I would only care if I could play the second one where I could make her explode or break her neck.

1467
02:00:24,562 --> 02:00:40,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, last but not least, and this is really just more good that the video game community is doing, Microsoft has been putting it out there for the Zoo Tycoon community to actually do something to raise money for endangered species.

1468
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:46,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Each month, Microsoft is launching a Zoo Tycoon Community Challenge to help raise money to help these animals.

1469
02:00:47,713 --> 02:00:52,514
[SPEAKER_02]: and when the challenge's goal has been reached, Microsoft will donate $10,000 to the chosen non-profit.

1470
02:00:53,114 --> 02:00:57,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Players will get updates on how the money is spent with reports from Microsoft.

1471
02:00:58,995 --> 02:01:01,176
[SPEAKER_02]: December 31st, this one was released.

1472
02:01:01,196 --> 02:01:04,436
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,000 rhinos into the wild in Zoo Tycoon and they will donate $10,000.

1473
02:01:04,476 --> 02:01:06,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Adopt 1,000 Komodo dragons in Zoo Tycoon and another $10,000.

1474
02:01:06,237 --> 02:01:09,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Release 1,000 Sumatran tigers and that's what they are.

1475
02:01:14,638 --> 02:01:17,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So hey, you know, they're doing something good.

1476
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:19,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Kudos to them.

1477
02:01:19,501 --> 02:01:21,322
[SPEAKER_09]: We like to hear about gamers doing good.

1478
02:01:21,342 --> 02:01:22,662
[SPEAKER_02]: We like the fuzzy animals.

1479
02:01:22,922 --> 02:01:26,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming companies getting people involved and everything.

1480
02:01:26,684 --> 02:01:27,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Komodo dragons.

1481
02:01:27,985 --> 02:01:28,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Good stuff.

1482
02:01:29,225 --> 02:01:30,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Entertainment says let's play cocks.

1483
02:01:32,407 --> 02:01:33,468
[SPEAKER_09]: He's talking about chickens, of course.

1484
02:01:34,148 --> 02:01:39,030
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get into a segment we do here on OLR called the Fugle Question of the Week.

1485
02:01:40,391 --> 02:01:41,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wrong music.

1486
02:01:41,392 --> 02:01:41,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1487
02:01:43,491 --> 02:01:44,134
[SPEAKER_09]: 180, pull back.

1488
02:01:44,978 --> 02:01:45,762
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1489
02:01:45,782 --> 02:01:46,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Question of the week.

1490
02:01:52,182 --> 02:02:04,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, every week we ask a question on our Facebook communities, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus community at Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio until they, you know, pull our page because they think it's not really us or something.

1491
02:02:05,016 --> 02:02:14,505
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, we actually, we flipped the script a little bit this week because it has been a really slow news week and I guess we could have asked about the YouTube, I guess we could have asked about something else, but...

1492
02:02:15,166 --> 02:02:15,707
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1493
02:02:15,827 --> 02:02:22,174
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed like a great excuse for us to do another installment of a segment here on OLR we haven't done in an awfully long time.

1494
02:02:22,234 --> 02:02:25,798
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a special holiday edition of Ask Orange Lounge.

1495
02:02:28,221 --> 02:02:29,322
[SPEAKER_09]: For real this time.

1496
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:32,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

1497
02:02:33,261 --> 02:02:34,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Some stupid question.

1498
02:02:34,901 --> 02:02:36,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, will we find out this week?

1499
02:02:36,562 --> 02:02:45,486
[SPEAKER_09]: On Orange Lounge Radio, we pulled Facebook and Google, and thank God we're still on Google, but we might not be much longer if they keep up this fuckery.

1500
02:02:47,106 --> 02:02:48,849
[SPEAKER_09]: It timed well.

1501
02:02:49,009 --> 02:02:54,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I should, honest to God, be on Whose Line Is It Anyway because I make that shit up on the spot, right?

1502
02:02:54,517 --> 02:02:55,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I miss my calling.

1503
02:02:55,739 --> 02:02:56,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Wayne Brady.

1504
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:57,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Get down with Aisha.

1505
02:02:57,321 --> 02:02:58,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm coming for you.

1506
02:02:58,643 --> 02:02:58,984
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1507
02:02:59,444 --> 02:03:00,185
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Wayne Brady.

1508
02:03:00,225 --> 02:03:00,846
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Aisha.

1509
02:03:01,307 --> 02:03:02,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Wayne Brady's one of the stars.

1510
02:03:02,909 --> 02:03:03,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1511
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:11,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason is going to be fielding our Fugle questions this week because some of our listeners are asking us questions.

1512
02:03:11,845 --> 02:03:14,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we doing every question tonight or are you just picking some of your favorites?

1513
02:03:15,147 --> 02:03:17,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll jump around a little bit and see how many we go for time.

1514
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:19,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Pick your favorites for time purposes.

1515
02:03:19,331 --> 02:03:20,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't drag this out too long.

1516
02:03:20,491 --> 02:03:22,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Tech 2030 starts us off with a ringer.

1517
02:03:23,093 --> 02:03:23,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing off limits?

1518
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:26,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm going to get crazy with this one.

1519
02:03:27,036 --> 02:03:27,777
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your favorite color?

1520
02:03:28,758 --> 02:03:29,038
Laughter

1521
02:03:29,878 --> 02:03:34,820
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite color is dark green, sometimes dark purple, depending on my mood.

1522
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:35,980
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

1523
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:38,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Black, because it depends on your version of color theory.

1524
02:03:38,641 --> 02:03:40,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either all of the colors or none of the colors.

1525
02:03:41,262 --> 02:03:41,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

1526
02:03:43,003 --> 02:03:46,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly enough, because of the show, I did a lot of orange stuff, so orange.

1527
02:03:47,364 --> 02:03:47,964
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1528
02:03:48,905 --> 02:03:50,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost bought an orange bike.

1529
02:03:50,839 --> 02:03:52,280
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1530
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:17,200
[SPEAKER_09]: What about my answer?

1531
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:19,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Jason, what's your answer?

1532
02:04:19,461 --> 02:04:25,022
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, without going too crazy with it, what's funny is that I actually don't really have a favorite color anymore.

1533
02:04:25,242 --> 02:04:26,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Growing up, it was green.

1534
02:04:26,562 --> 02:04:29,043
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of started to change to blue in the last couple of years.

1535
02:04:29,983 --> 02:04:32,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really identify a favorite color anymore.

1536
02:04:32,364 --> 02:04:33,044
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of weird.

1537
02:04:33,204 --> 02:04:37,345
[SPEAKER_08]: But green was the biggest portion of my youth for an incredibly long time.

1538
02:04:37,385 --> 02:04:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know I had green hair once?

1539
02:04:39,561 --> 02:05:05,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not think I've seen pictures so I will go with I was in college in Alabama definitely did not see pictures so I was probably about 20 years old and had the top you know how people now are like doing their hair two different colors not the ombre thing but the underside one color the underside stayed brown the top was forest green manic panic which I don't even think you can get that color anymore fifth dream I love this comment in the chat room at live.vognover.com fifth dream says let me answer let me answer I have no answer

1540
02:05:06,794 --> 02:05:08,296
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what Jason just did.

1541
02:05:09,177 --> 02:05:10,598
[SPEAKER_09]: But Jason, I was going to say this.

1542
02:05:10,638 --> 02:05:15,902
[SPEAKER_09]: You say you may not have particularly a favorite color, but don't you like when you go shopping for clothes or something, you're kind of drawn to one color?

1543
02:05:16,042 --> 02:05:20,746
[SPEAKER_09]: My friends make fun of me because a lot of my wardrobe is all earth colors, like brown.

1544
02:05:21,267 --> 02:05:22,248
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of true.

1545
02:05:22,488 --> 02:05:23,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I wear a lot of brown and green.

1546
02:05:23,669 --> 02:05:25,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I wear a lot of brown and black.

1547
02:05:25,290 --> 02:05:26,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I wear earth colors.

1548
02:05:26,091 --> 02:05:27,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't go shopping for clothes.

1549
02:05:28,453 --> 02:05:28,553
[SPEAKER_08]: PJ

1550
02:05:56,054 --> 02:05:59,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Biggest letdown title or game-related news of the year?

1551
02:06:01,178 --> 02:06:04,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Biggest letdown title or game-related news of the year?

1552
02:06:04,701 --> 02:06:10,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, I'd really have to look at some of the stories from this year to remember.

1553
02:06:10,386 --> 02:06:11,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what let me down.

1554
02:06:12,828 --> 02:06:13,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1555
02:06:13,629 --> 02:06:13,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Go for it.

1556
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:16,852
[SPEAKER_02]: When my Mass Effect 3 data pad stopped working so I couldn't stay at 100%.

1557
02:06:16,892 --> 02:06:16,992
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1558
02:06:17,012 --> 02:06:17,232
[SPEAKER_02]: True story.

1559
02:06:21,542 --> 02:06:23,564
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1560
02:06:43,984 --> 02:06:59,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm tempted to go through for the easy answer and say Xbox's original policies, but to be fair, they did change it and everything's cool now and the new consoles are doing just fine, so I can't really hate on that too much.

1561
02:07:00,093 --> 02:07:01,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say this.

1562
02:07:02,474 --> 02:07:08,378
[SPEAKER_09]: The biggest disappointment for me this year is third-party publishers openly pooping on the Wii U.

1563
02:07:09,338 --> 02:07:12,583
[SPEAKER_09]: EA's attitude towards the Wii U is my biggest disappointment this year.

1564
02:07:13,144 --> 02:07:14,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be my honest to God answer.

1565
02:07:15,503 --> 02:07:16,023
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good answer.

1566
02:07:18,085 --> 02:07:26,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly don't have an answer to that question just because my involvement, lack of, precludes me from that this year.

1567
02:07:26,970 --> 02:07:28,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Not in the new consoles.

1568
02:07:28,411 --> 02:07:29,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Get up to speed.

1569
02:07:29,972 --> 02:07:31,073
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got the controllers, though.

1570
02:07:31,093 --> 02:07:31,733
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got the controllers.

1571
02:07:32,534 --> 02:07:34,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm contributing in other ways right now.

1572
02:07:34,135 --> 02:07:35,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Another question.

1573
02:07:35,316 --> 02:07:35,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting there.

1574
02:07:36,096 --> 02:07:41,099
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Bat says, if there were a VOG slash OLR con, who would you want as the keynote speaker?

1575
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:41,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

1576
02:07:45,888 --> 02:07:46,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Me.

1577
02:07:46,728 --> 02:07:48,469
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1578
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:52,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I would want Jason Enos to be one of the speakers.

1579
02:07:52,812 --> 02:07:53,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I miss him.

1580
02:07:53,972 --> 02:08:05,098
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if necessarily the keynote, but I just think as far as DDR community, which remember this show started as a music game community show, which was in large part to DDR.

1581
02:08:05,278 --> 02:08:09,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we directly have Jason to thank for that kind of happening in the US in the first place.

1582
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:12,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So I sort of think we owe that debt.

1583
02:08:13,622 --> 02:08:15,383
[SPEAKER_09]: If nothing else, to him.

1584
02:08:15,483 --> 02:08:19,184
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would hope if there is a con, we can convince him to come say hello.

1585
02:08:20,865 --> 02:08:21,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Keynote speaker.

1586
02:08:24,327 --> 02:08:29,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the guy that plays Sekata Sanchiro to be our keynote speaker and to do it in character.

1587
02:08:31,728 --> 02:08:34,209
[SPEAKER_09]: The President of Pinkberry

1588
02:08:56,445 --> 02:09:01,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, not the co-founder guy that got arrested for all that fucked up stuff or got to court.

1589
02:09:01,749 --> 02:09:02,990
[SPEAKER_09]: He did some really fucked up stuff.

1590
02:09:03,030 --> 02:09:03,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Not him.

1591
02:09:03,610 --> 02:09:03,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Not him.

1592
02:09:04,010 --> 02:09:04,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Not him.

1593
02:09:04,611 --> 02:09:04,851
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1594
02:09:04,911 --> 02:09:05,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Not him.

1595
02:09:05,592 --> 02:09:05,892
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1596
02:09:06,452 --> 02:09:08,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, I don't know if you have an answer, but if not, another question.

1597
02:09:09,775 --> 02:09:10,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Me?

1598
02:09:10,315 --> 02:09:10,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the voice.

1599
02:09:11,156 --> 02:09:12,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1600
02:09:12,437 --> 02:09:14,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason would be the voice that would announce all the speakers.

1601
02:09:14,738 --> 02:09:16,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I would definitely introduce the keynote speaker.

1602
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:17,060
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that?

1603
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:18,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

1604
02:09:18,361 --> 02:09:21,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Redertainment says a keynote address from Rob's mom.

1605
02:09:21,864 --> 02:09:23,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Bobby Blackwolf should give a speech.

1606
02:09:23,945 --> 02:09:25,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Bobby.

1607
02:09:26,146 --> 02:09:31,987
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's going to be a keynote speaker, shouldn't Bobby Blackwolf open OLRCon?

1608
02:09:32,148 --> 02:09:32,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yes.

1609
02:09:32,908 --> 02:09:34,588
[SPEAKER_02]: With commentary by your mom.

1610
02:09:36,709 --> 02:09:37,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, who's that guy up there?

1611
02:09:38,069 --> 02:09:39,150
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the definitive answer.

1612
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:40,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby and my mother.

1613
02:09:40,230 --> 02:09:44,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And Travis Donovan, too, to be fair.

1614
02:09:44,671 --> 02:09:51,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the name came up, Hunter R. would like to ask, Dearest Orange Lounge, is Pinkberry one of those make-your-own-frozen-yogurt places?

1615
02:09:52,114 --> 02:09:52,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even better.

1616
02:09:53,891 --> 02:09:54,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Better flavor.

1617
02:09:54,712 --> 02:09:56,653
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't make it your own.

1618
02:09:56,713 --> 02:10:05,701
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of traditional like Baskin Robbins behind the counter style, but the ingredients are fresh and good and beautiful.

1619
02:10:05,921 --> 02:10:10,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not paying us, so I hate that we keep giving them free advertising, but it is really good.

1620
02:10:10,885 --> 02:10:12,567
[SPEAKER_02]: But they friended us both on Twitter.

1621
02:10:12,967 --> 02:10:13,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, did they?

1622
02:10:13,627 --> 02:10:13,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1623
02:10:32,573 --> 02:10:35,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Soft Serb yogurts that you can get from anywhere.

1624
02:10:35,935 --> 02:10:36,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1625
02:10:36,395 --> 02:10:39,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is pretty low calorie unless you get like peanut butter or something.

1626
02:10:39,356 --> 02:10:41,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get a mini size which is perfect.

1627
02:10:41,937 --> 02:10:45,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can get it in a cone if you're feeling like having a fat day like I do a lot.

1628
02:10:46,439 --> 02:10:46,739
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1629
02:10:47,139 --> 02:10:49,800
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's nothing else to add to that then another question.

1630
02:10:50,905 --> 02:10:52,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we get Loki's answer?

1631
02:10:53,646 --> 02:10:54,786
[SPEAKER_09]: On what makes Pinkberry different?

1632
02:10:54,806 --> 02:10:55,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there's much you can add to that.

1633
02:10:55,907 --> 02:10:56,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fair enough.

1634
02:10:56,467 --> 02:10:57,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, good point.

1635
02:10:58,128 --> 02:11:03,349
[SPEAKER_08]: We will then end with the one that I completely lost sight of, and it's in here somewhere.

1636
02:11:03,429 --> 02:11:09,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Fifth Dream asks, What is the one game each of the hostings has been too ignored and should be played by everyone?

1637
02:11:09,171 --> 02:11:13,053
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, is there a little-known game you would force everyone to play if you could?

1638
02:11:14,233 --> 02:11:14,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

1639
02:11:15,694 --> 02:11:16,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I have really picked the winners.

1640
02:11:19,361 --> 02:11:40,563
[SPEAKER_09]: these are questions I wanted more warning on one game I would make everybody play if I could looking at the shelf of games over there I'm not in my vault so I really can't say I'll go for the easy cop out answer but it's so true because I need people to understand why we love the Guardian Legend

1641
02:11:40,891 --> 02:11:43,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, well, that was what I was going to say, but I knew you'd pick it too.

1642
02:11:44,433 --> 02:11:45,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, sure.

1643
02:11:45,693 --> 02:11:46,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, is there a game you'd make?

1644
02:11:47,054 --> 02:11:47,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, no.

1645
02:11:47,614 --> 02:11:49,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming to me.

1646
02:11:49,995 --> 02:11:51,136
[SPEAKER_09]: It has four letters.

1647
02:11:51,216 --> 02:11:53,217
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts with grand and ends with five.

1648
02:11:53,237 --> 02:11:54,377
[SPEAKER_09]: It's little known.

1649
02:11:55,398 --> 02:11:56,498
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not little known.

1650
02:11:56,898 --> 02:12:00,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And no, I would say Earth Defense Force 2017 or 2025.

1651
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:01,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Excite Truck.

1652
02:12:05,172 --> 02:12:06,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, Excite Truck.

1653
02:12:06,433 --> 02:12:07,854
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually a very worthy answer.

1654
02:12:08,695 --> 02:12:11,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks in chat, Red Entertainment, saying Mass Effect.

1655
02:12:11,337 --> 02:12:12,438
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not Little Known.

1656
02:12:12,658 --> 02:12:14,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that would be Shane's answer anyway.

1657
02:12:14,219 --> 02:12:16,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane's not here, so fuck it.

1658
02:12:16,401 --> 02:12:19,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Katamari sprang to mind for me pretty much immediately.

1659
02:12:19,943 --> 02:12:22,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's just above the cusp of Little Known.

1660
02:12:22,925 --> 02:12:25,107
[SPEAKER_08]: It had a pretty reasonable bout of success.

1661
02:12:25,127 --> 02:12:32,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, if you think about it, we probably have some 17 and 18 year olds that listen to this show that were probably kind of young when that game first came out.

1662
02:12:32,653 --> 02:12:33,433
[SPEAKER_09]: They might have missed it.

1663
02:12:33,894 --> 02:12:34,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1664
02:12:34,735 --> 02:12:36,118
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting older by the year.

1665
02:12:38,081 --> 02:12:47,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I rather think that I would have said Fantasy Zone because it is one of my favorite little shooter games of all time.

1666
02:12:47,127 --> 02:12:49,629
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my second favorite video game.

1667
02:12:50,670 --> 02:12:57,294
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is fairly well known in the classic gaming community because it's a big Sega title.

1668
02:12:57,354 --> 02:12:58,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been out forever.

1669
02:13:00,757 --> 02:13:05,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am going to go... Fuck it, I'll just go with Fantasy Zone.

1670
02:13:06,165 --> 02:13:30,338
[SPEAKER_09]: there is a part of me that wants to go like super duper old school and say everybody like you know because some of y'all missed the Atari 2600 and I would say kangaroo you all need to experience the frustration but yet awesome that comes with playing sword quest any of them air world earth or what was no air world didn't come out here what was the first one that came out I think it was earth world was the first I remember they were all they all kind of blurred together for me but that first sword quest game

1671
02:13:30,894 --> 02:13:36,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I will tell you, as far as old school Game Boy games, that not many people would think of Revenge of the Gator.

1672
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good game.

1673
02:13:39,751 --> 02:13:40,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason?

1674
02:13:41,472 --> 02:13:44,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually would say Mother 3.

1675
02:13:46,076 --> 02:13:56,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely think Earthbound was little known, and playing the whole series is worth it, but Mother 3 is a fantastic game.

1676
02:13:56,244 --> 02:14:00,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually not finished it myself, but I've seen the entirety of the game beginning to end.

1677
02:14:01,288 --> 02:14:22,882
[SPEAKER_08]: that game is just straight up fun like it's it's battle system has the charm of Mario RPG great writing great music the story is a bit against against the grain against the cuff it's it's quite fun like seek out this game if you even know what Earthbound is obviously it's technically Earthbound 2 it is the same in the storyline

1678
02:14:23,542 --> 02:14:24,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, wait, hold on.

1679
02:14:24,684 --> 02:14:29,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we wrap, I just wanted to say I had to look it up and it was Earthworld.

1680
02:14:29,750 --> 02:14:30,370
[SPEAKER_09]: It was going to bug me.

1681
02:14:30,451 --> 02:14:33,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Sword Quest Earthworld was the first one and Fireworld was out too.

1682
02:14:33,234 --> 02:14:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that the one where they had the contest?

1683
02:14:35,857 --> 02:14:39,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you would win all of this stuff but they never finished the series?

1684
02:14:41,023 --> 02:14:45,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And just for the old school OLR people, I also have to throw out there BurgerTime.

1685
02:14:45,545 --> 02:14:46,505
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to play BurgerTime.

1686
02:14:46,826 --> 02:14:47,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I would agree with that.

1687
02:14:47,626 --> 02:14:49,767
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a fun, silly classic.

1688
02:14:49,787 --> 02:14:50,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Why, it is.

1689
02:14:51,087 --> 02:15:01,872
[SPEAKER_08]: The hotel that I usually stay at in San Francisco has a little set-top arcade, a flat-top arcade, multi-main type thing.

1690
02:15:02,732 --> 02:15:06,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And I always plop down and play BurgerTime on it if I'm not doing anything else.

1691
02:15:06,394 --> 02:15:07,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

1692
02:15:07,634 --> 02:15:10,078
[SPEAKER_08]: We will end with... Yay, one more.

1693
02:15:10,138 --> 02:15:11,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Another question, another question.

1694
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:16,648
[SPEAKER_08]: We will end with William Murderface asking, which game releases are all of you looking forward to in 2014?

1695
02:15:16,809 --> 02:15:20,715
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the first big thing on your radar for 2014?

1696
02:15:22,948 --> 02:15:27,590
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever the next Mass Effect is because I kind of really don't care about much else.

1697
02:15:27,730 --> 02:15:29,331
[SPEAKER_08]: One was announced, wasn't it?

1698
02:15:29,651 --> 02:15:32,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Not exactly a core game but something related to it?

1699
02:15:32,633 --> 02:15:35,974
[SPEAKER_11]: It's outside the trilogy story.

1700
02:15:36,014 --> 02:15:37,235
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a new thing.

1701
02:15:37,515 --> 02:15:50,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the universe so much that there's still this hopeful little spark inside of me that hasn't been completely stomped on by the writing team that hopes that there might be something a little bit less human-centric out

1702
02:15:52,422 --> 02:16:01,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm keeping my fingers crossed if I'm going to be disappointed let me be disappointed let me be heartbroken but I still want to see what it is

1703
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:21,331
[SPEAKER_09]: believe it or not, Destiny which might surprise you because I don't usually talk about first person shooters but I'm really excited to check that game out and I'm hoping Nintendo gets Smash Brothers out this next year because I'm really looking forward to that as well Loki, what are you most looking forward to in 2014?

1704
02:16:21,371 --> 02:16:33,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to check out No Man's Sky because that looks pretty sweet and then I don't know there's not a whole ton I'm actually looking forward to so far

1705
02:16:34,095 --> 02:16:49,285
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be nice if Sunset Overdrive came out, because that looked like a really interesting trailer, but then again, so did, what was it, Fuse, I think, was the one, yeah, that was by Insomniac that ended up sucking, so I don't know.

1706
02:16:49,305 --> 02:16:51,927
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to see.

1707
02:16:52,147 --> 02:16:55,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's just going to be a lot of stuff that we haven't seen announced yet, but it's going to be pretty good.

1708
02:16:55,890 --> 02:17:03,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping, too, that there'll be, like, something announced at E3 that we just don't know of yet, and I think that is also my answer.

1709
02:17:04,727 --> 02:17:05,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Kelly Mantle and Courtney Act

1710
02:17:22,425 --> 02:17:41,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Colton the Act is going to is almost a sure win for the top three that by the way that's that's what Courtney Act is Australian so her name is really Colton the Act Colton the Act which you gotta love that come on that's a great jacket but I think she's I think she's too good for the show I know that sounds really horrible but she's

1711
02:17:41,523 --> 02:17:43,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, she's like huge in Australia already.

1712
02:17:43,747 --> 02:17:44,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's just kind of weird.

1713
02:17:44,728 --> 02:17:45,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1714
02:17:45,249 --> 02:17:53,642
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also, I think Kelly Mantle, even though she had her own logo special a couple years ago and also might be too big for the show, I think she's going to do very well too.

1715
02:17:53,683 --> 02:17:55,826
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like to bend and I like to cram based on the videos.

1716
02:17:56,647 --> 02:17:58,388
[SPEAKER_08]: That concludes Orange Drag Radio.

1717
02:17:59,009 --> 02:18:01,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for your questions.

1718
02:18:01,130 --> 02:18:10,858
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you that actually know, if you actually know what the Reading is Fundamental podcast is, there might be like two people out there listening, that is going to come back this next year, so I'll say that much.

1719
02:18:12,619 --> 02:18:14,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Google it, or look it up on iTunes.

1720
02:18:14,741 --> 02:18:16,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

1721
02:18:16,922 --> 02:18:18,283
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got more gaming news to get to.

1722
02:18:18,363 --> 02:18:18,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1723
02:18:19,704 --> 02:18:25,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so the first set of indie games coming to Xbox One are going to be

1724
02:18:27,181 --> 02:18:27,441
[SPEAKER_07]: March 2014.

1725
02:18:27,541 --> 02:18:34,386
[SPEAKER_07]: This is part of that ID at Xbox program that they have there.

1726
02:18:36,188 --> 02:18:41,952
[SPEAKER_07]: This includes stuff from Halfbrick Studios, Double Fine, Crytek, and Vladimir.

1727
02:18:42,673 --> 02:18:47,757
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's nice that they're finally going to start having some decent indie games on there.

1728
02:18:50,679 --> 02:18:53,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything in particular that you personally are looking forward to?

1729
02:18:54,597 --> 02:18:55,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, because I haven't really seen.

1730
02:18:55,978 --> 02:19:01,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of it's just going to be ports of stuff that we're seeing already are coming to the PlayStation 4 and stuff.

1731
02:19:03,402 --> 02:19:07,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really heard of any standout indie games.

1732
02:19:07,405 --> 02:19:16,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from, even though I've purchased it on pretty much every platform, Minecraft would be interesting to see what they do with Minecraft on the next-gen platforms.

1733
02:19:18,354 --> 02:19:18,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1734
02:19:19,595 --> 02:19:22,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm curious to see how Minecraft is on the next-gen platforms, too.

1735
02:19:22,316 --> 02:19:26,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking it'll be unlimited-sized worlds again, like it is on PC.

1736
02:19:26,517 --> 02:19:29,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll just be more like PC, but with some of the console enhancements.

1737
02:19:29,659 --> 02:19:30,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that'll be pretty cool.

1738
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:41,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, there was a Killer Instinct tournament that happened, and it caused a lot of news to spread around the internet about Wildfire, about the Xbox One, and some DRM checks, because everybody's like...

1739
02:19:42,944 --> 02:19:46,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Did the DRM magically come back to the Xbox One?

1740
02:19:46,465 --> 02:19:58,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what happened is there was actually this clip going on of a Killer Instinct tournament, and what happens partway through this tournament is that the Xbox One comes up to the dashboard and says, Do you own this gamer app?

1741
02:19:58,990 --> 02:20:00,250
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have the disc, insert it now.

1742
02:20:00,290 --> 02:20:02,471
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's no disc, make sure you're signed into Xbox Live.

1743
02:20:02,751 --> 02:20:05,732
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have the rights for playing it, you'll need to buy it at the Xbox Store.

1744
02:20:06,092 --> 02:20:10,234
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody was like, Oh my God, the Xbox One's doing check-ins, da-da-da-da-da.

1745
02:20:10,954 --> 02:20:17,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Well now, Bobby talked about this on his show a little bit tonight as well, and kind of gives some insight to this, so I'm going to just totally bite off what he said.

1746
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:25,906
[SPEAKER_09]: But basically, it wasn't that the Xbox was necessarily doing an online check-in, because if you think about it, I mean logically think about it.

1747
02:20:26,747 --> 02:20:31,850
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have already been connected once in the past 24 hours Why would it suddenly disconnect during the tournament?

1748
02:20:32,170 --> 02:20:49,820
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem was that somebody was playing the game on a system that wasn't theirs They were playing it on a different system And if you think about it, Xbox and even PlayStation kind of already do that today So this isn't necessarily something new It just happened in the middle of the game

1749
02:20:50,840 --> 02:21:11,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, not that I'm necessarily defending what's happening here, because that is really weird that it would have allowed the game to launch in the first place, and that it stops the game in progress or what have you, that's a little bit weird, and that there ought to be a little bit of give when you're going to go over to friends' houses and play games or do these tournaments or what have you, but, you know...

1750
02:21:12,068 --> 02:21:26,110
[SPEAKER_09]: if you're gonna play these games make sure they're on the Xbox you bought them on or these things might happen you can't just go around and take your digital game and download it on all these other different consoles it isn't gonna work that way it doesn't work that way on the 360

1751
02:21:28,289 --> 02:21:31,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf chimes in and says their 4G dropped.

1752
02:21:31,372 --> 02:21:32,293
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happened.

1753
02:21:32,753 --> 02:21:35,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was checking on the internet, checking on the internet, and then it dropped.

1754
02:21:36,116 --> 02:21:41,981
[SPEAKER_09]: This happens on my 360 games today, actually, because I had to get my console replaced because of the red ring.

1755
02:21:42,502 --> 02:21:51,009
[SPEAKER_09]: And even though I transferred my licenses, for some reason, whenever I play an older game, like I go into Geometry Wars, let's say, that was like the first arcade game I bought on Xbox 360.

1756
02:21:51,790 --> 02:22:13,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I see the demo title screen for like two seconds and then all of a sudden it flips to the retail screen because what it's doing it's checking the internet making sure I really own it and then it will update my demo copy of the game with oh Green Sky is trying to play it he bought the game here it is so this already happens on the 360 it's just kind of weird

1757
02:22:13,633 --> 02:22:20,919
[SPEAKER_09]: and Bobby's telling me that the reason why it's still checking is that if I do the license transfer, you still have to delete and re-download the game.

1758
02:22:21,199 --> 02:22:21,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Good lord.

1759
02:22:21,940 --> 02:22:23,401
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of games, Bobby.

1760
02:22:23,421 --> 02:22:24,242
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like 50 games.

1761
02:22:24,962 --> 02:22:26,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather just be online, honestly.

1762
02:22:27,104 --> 02:22:30,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And how often am I playing my old 360 games anymore?

1763
02:22:30,627 --> 02:22:31,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Once every few months.

1764
02:22:31,548 --> 02:22:31,968
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1765
02:22:33,929 --> 02:22:34,950
[SPEAKER_09]: So just bottom line...

1766
02:22:36,431 --> 02:23:01,180
[SPEAKER_09]: keep the digital rights rules in the back of your head because it's going to be the same on 360 and these systems and no, they did not suddenly insert in all these rules that they explicitly said they weren't going to do so be careful in jumping to conclusions gaming journalists I'm watching you face alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1767
02:23:01,556 --> 02:23:04,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been having a discussion about aliens.

1768
02:23:05,058 --> 02:23:05,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1769
02:23:05,679 --> 02:23:05,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1770
02:23:06,580 --> 02:23:07,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they real?

1771
02:23:08,301 --> 02:23:08,661
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1772
02:23:11,083 --> 02:23:12,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I brought up Namco, hi.

1773
02:23:12,724 --> 02:23:13,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're wrong.

1774
02:23:13,925 --> 02:23:14,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1775
02:23:14,405 --> 02:23:15,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're wrong.

1776
02:23:15,546 --> 02:23:16,206
[SPEAKER_09]: There's aliens.

1777
02:23:16,326 --> 02:23:17,227
[SPEAKER_09]: We just don't know them yet.

1778
02:23:17,707 --> 02:23:18,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Trek is real.

1779
02:23:18,688 --> 02:23:21,410
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I guarantee you if they showed up, we'd try to fuck them.

1780
02:23:23,851 --> 02:23:24,252
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1781
02:23:25,773 --> 02:23:26,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1782
02:23:26,573 --> 02:23:28,054
[SPEAKER_02]: If fandom is to be believed.

1783
02:23:28,775 --> 02:23:28,955
Okay.

1784
02:23:29,395 --> 02:23:31,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody would ship them in 30 seconds.

1785
02:23:31,999 --> 02:23:34,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, anything can be shipped.

1786
02:23:34,582 --> 02:23:35,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, trust me.

1787
02:23:35,423 --> 02:23:35,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1788
02:23:35,984 --> 02:23:37,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the ship from Galaga.

1789
02:23:38,648 --> 02:23:39,909
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that for transition?

1790
02:23:40,829 --> 02:24:08,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco High I've been playing it and it's fucking weird it's a dating sim it's more like a visual novel really less a dating sim although if you really want to just romance somebody all you have to do is pick them and only them and do all of their scenes and you're guaranteed cute little romances but you have certain characters that you can romance like Mr. Driller or Lolo from Klonoa

1791
02:24:08,864 --> 02:24:10,465
[SPEAKER_02]: or the Galaga ship.

1792
02:24:10,986 --> 02:24:11,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is awesome?

1793
02:24:13,227 --> 02:24:15,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Galaga refers to Galaga in the third person.

1794
02:24:15,689 --> 02:24:16,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Galaga is amazing.

1795
02:24:17,170 --> 02:24:18,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Galaga says greetings, humans.

1796
02:24:20,392 --> 02:24:24,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, when I played it, I got the deluxe set.

1797
02:24:24,655 --> 02:24:33,741
[SPEAKER_02]: You can unlock the characters for $1.95 individually if you want to get past the... Ew, no, I wouldn't want a fucking Asari.

1798
02:24:33,801 --> 02:24:34,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuck.

1799
02:24:34,402 --> 02:24:34,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

1800
02:24:39,253 --> 02:24:42,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to talk about Homestuck, I mean Namco Highstuck.

1801
02:24:44,096 --> 02:25:03,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, you start off the game, you've got all of your Namco characters, you can also pay for premium characters for $1.95 a pop, $4.95 in sets of three, or $14.95 for the whole set, which is actually what I did, and I got the soundtrack, because I did the pre-order thing.

1802
02:25:04,349 --> 02:25:06,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have 18 dateable characters.

1803
02:25:06,671 --> 02:25:08,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I mentioned Homestuck.

1804
02:25:08,713 --> 02:25:10,154
[SPEAKER_02]: There are three Homestuck characters in it.

1805
02:25:10,734 --> 02:25:14,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Therese, who I dated first because she's awesome.

1806
02:25:15,017 --> 02:25:17,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have Dave Sprite, who made me sad.

1807
02:25:17,979 --> 02:25:19,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And James, who was freaking weird.

1808
02:25:20,161 --> 02:25:24,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, I think the next one I did was...

1809
02:25:27,646 --> 02:25:33,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Donko, the drum from Taiko no Tatsujin, who starts off on her cell phone in detention.

1810
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:35,771
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like the total Valley Girl type character.

1811
02:25:36,512 --> 02:25:41,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did Richard Miller from Time Crisis, who was kind of weird.

1812
02:25:41,995 --> 02:25:44,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's really just bizarre in this game.

1813
02:25:45,117 --> 02:26:09,209
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're all bizarre in an incredibly entertaining way and like Pac-Man comes out and gives you advice but the advice is always be true to yourself although sometimes the advice is maybe you shouldn't be true to yourself and like the principal is Dig Dug and the detention teacher is King from Tekken and the only sound he ever makes is a roar and then he yells at you

1814
02:26:10,309 --> 02:26:15,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really out there and super funny and I think the whole thing was well done.

1815
02:26:16,096 --> 02:26:27,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a lot of these games, there's people who may not get all the games these characters came from like Albatross and Hitomi and Amazonia.

1816
02:26:29,192 --> 02:26:35,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, Fifth Dream posted a picture of Galaga talking to the cousin.

1817
02:26:35,702 --> 02:26:41,451
[SPEAKER_02]: You play the cousin of the Prince of All Cosmos who gets thrown in detention because he rolled up the school into a giant Katamari.

1818
02:26:43,165 --> 02:26:43,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just funny.

1819
02:26:43,705 --> 02:26:47,666
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to fight evil Namco Hai at one point and they're all robots.

1820
02:26:49,366 --> 02:26:51,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So I didn't realize this game was actually already out.

1821
02:26:51,567 --> 02:26:53,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's an HTML5 game.

1822
02:26:53,247 --> 02:27:11,270
[SPEAKER_02]: The HTML5 was done by a group called DateNaito and I've actually emailed them to ask them what their licensing costs are for their engine because I'm trying to do a webcomic in Flash but I would like to be able to do a visual novel style and have it be accessible for people on iOS.

1823
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:15,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but yeah, it's, it's, it's cute.

1824
02:27:15,293 --> 02:27:21,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody wants to see other screen caps from it, you can go to my Tumblr, uh, kurotsubasa.tumblr.com.

1825
02:27:22,060 --> 02:27:24,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I might repost some stuff on the OLR, um, Tumblr.

1826
02:27:25,703 --> 02:27:25,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1827
02:27:26,604 --> 02:27:26,865
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1828
02:27:27,786 --> 02:27:28,847
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's fucking cute.

1829
02:27:28,867 --> 02:27:29,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Namco dating sim.

1830
02:27:30,128 --> 02:27:30,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1831
02:27:30,949 --> 02:27:33,171
[SPEAKER_09]: We're, we're awkward.

1832
02:27:33,932 --> 02:27:36,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of dating sim, but really more visual novel.

1833
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:37,260
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1834
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:39,021
[SPEAKER_09]: A good waste of time.

1835
02:27:39,621 --> 02:27:39,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1836
02:27:39,861 --> 02:27:40,801
[SPEAKER_09]: A waste of time in a good way.

1837
02:27:40,841 --> 02:27:47,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I can sit there for like 30 minutes and go, oh, and it usually actually only takes me that long because I'm doing screen caps because I'm like, what the fuck did they just say?

1838
02:27:49,384 --> 02:27:49,784
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1839
02:27:50,584 --> 02:27:51,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

1840
02:27:51,864 --> 02:27:54,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, I don't know if your story is on a dating sim, but.

1841
02:27:56,826 --> 02:27:58,066
[SPEAKER_07]: No, thank goodness.

1842
02:27:59,107 --> 02:28:00,147
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's talking about the.

1843
02:28:00,822 --> 02:28:23,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Steam Machine Teardowns because just recently the 300 people that made it into the hardware beta received their prototype Steam Machines and of course iFixit somehow got one as part of their Teardown pages that they do and they found out that there's a ton of expensive stuff in there including an NVIDIA GTX 780 also a Core i5 4570 running at 3.6 GHz

1844
02:28:30,274 --> 02:28:36,597
[SPEAKER_07]: and pricing everything out, it looks like that that machine runs roughly about $1,300.

1845
02:28:38,098 --> 02:28:40,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So a pretty powerful little PC.

1846
02:28:42,781 --> 02:28:43,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I want one.

1847
02:28:43,901 --> 02:28:44,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, me too.

1848
02:28:46,523 --> 02:28:48,504
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to sell a $1,500 TV-connected device.

1849
02:28:48,524 --> 02:28:48,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I just...

1850
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:00,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't know who the audience is for those high-end machines.

1851
02:29:01,223 --> 02:29:05,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the low-end ones have more potential to do more business, but I don't know.

1852
02:29:05,126 --> 02:29:05,846
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot less games?

1853
02:29:06,907 --> 02:29:08,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not necessarily.

1854
02:29:08,148 --> 02:29:11,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of those Steam games don't take much, especially the indie stuff.

1855
02:29:11,550 --> 02:29:17,355
[SPEAKER_08]: This whole thing, every time I hear... I'm really, really into it.

1856
02:29:18,236 --> 02:29:22,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I mentioned in the intro last week that SteamOS was out for hobbyists and system builders.

1857
02:29:22,999 --> 02:29:24,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking forward to it.

1858
02:29:24,339 --> 02:29:29,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to dip my toes in and see if there's something that I can do with it and see what they come up with.

1859
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:30,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very interested in this.

1860
02:29:30,741 --> 02:29:36,862
[SPEAKER_08]: But the hardware portion of it, sans the controller, doesn't make a lick of sense to me.

1861
02:29:37,402 --> 02:29:40,143
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't plug computers into our TVs.

1862
02:29:41,263 --> 02:29:49,484
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that actually plug computers into their TVs are incredibly few in the larger community.

1863
02:29:52,385 --> 02:30:00,527
[SPEAKER_08]: The things that get plugged into TVs are small, tiny little... Crap, I've completely forgotten the word.

1864
02:30:01,888 --> 02:30:04,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Home entertainment system devices.

1865
02:30:05,629 --> 02:30:11,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just... I'm insanely interested at the same time I don't understand it.

1866
02:30:13,471 --> 02:30:16,012
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a very interesting 2014 for Valve.

1867
02:30:16,252 --> 02:30:17,192
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about all I can say.

1868
02:30:17,954 --> 02:30:45,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm more interested in the front end, how everything's going to work because mainly I would love to have I'm not necessarily going to buy a $1300 PC but I'd like to be able to build a PC and have that front end experience that you get with a console nowadays with the integration with Netflix and the different apps and stuff that you can put on there and have it work pretty seamless would be nice like Steam Big Picture Mode works great

1869
02:30:46,201 --> 02:30:49,354
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be nice if there was non-gaming apps.

1870
02:30:49,495 --> 02:30:51,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know they sell software and stuff.

1871
02:30:51,161 --> 02:30:52,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about like, you know.

1872
02:30:52,950 --> 02:30:56,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Skype, Netflix, Hulu, that kind of stuff.

1873
02:30:56,673 --> 02:31:10,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and like I was talking about with the PS4 controller I'm very close to turning Steam onto big picture mode by default so that I can just grab my controller, turn it on because it's Bluetooth paired and go to it.

1874
02:31:10,965 --> 02:31:13,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a nice interface and there's going to be a lot of benefits to it.

1875
02:31:14,088 --> 02:31:16,390
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the machine itself that confounds me.

1876
02:31:19,228 --> 02:31:19,628
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1877
02:31:21,049 --> 02:31:22,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

1878
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:23,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, it's me anyways, isn't it?

1879
02:31:23,351 --> 02:31:23,871
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1880
02:31:24,732 --> 02:31:26,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, wait, let me read a quick comment from our chat.

1881
02:31:27,013 --> 02:31:27,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1882
02:31:27,634 --> 02:31:34,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft at live.vognetwork.com says, Remember, people, the beta build of the Steam machine is exclusive to the beta, and it's not one model of the Steam machine.

1883
02:31:34,618 --> 02:31:41,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, we mentioned that's a high-end system and that there's low-end systems as well, and maybe that's more the audience for it.

1884
02:31:41,183 --> 02:31:46,406
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's going to be interesting to see how these things do put up against the console.

1885
02:31:46,686 --> 02:31:48,688
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't bring down those costs that much.

1886
02:31:49,588 --> 02:31:55,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you may spend more on the front end buying the console, but you can't argue those deals, man.

1887
02:31:56,874 --> 02:31:57,254
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1888
02:31:57,514 --> 02:31:58,254
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very true.

1889
02:31:58,274 --> 02:31:59,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, now we'll move on.

1890
02:31:59,215 --> 02:31:59,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason.

1891
02:31:59,876 --> 02:32:00,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1892
02:32:00,876 --> 02:32:05,199
[SPEAKER_08]: X-Men and the Simpsons Arcade have suddenly disappeared from the PlayStation Network.

1893
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:17,388
[SPEAKER_08]: They are still available on Xbox Live Arcade and doubly so considering that they are also available on the last chance on Marvel Games sale that Xbox Live is currently running right now.

1894
02:32:18,028 --> 02:32:19,269
[SPEAKER_08]: No official word.

1895
02:32:21,050 --> 02:32:23,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Polygon has reached out to Konami to figure out why this has happened.

1896
02:32:24,552 --> 02:32:32,376
[SPEAKER_08]: But no changes in price on Xbox Live Arcade, but outright removed from Sony's PlayStation Network listings.

1897
02:32:32,796 --> 02:32:34,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Licensing, maybe.

1898
02:32:35,278 --> 02:32:37,399
[SPEAKER_08]: It remains to be seen that it's so console-specific.

1899
02:32:37,959 --> 02:32:42,185
[SPEAKER_09]: It could also be that the holidays are delaying activity on Xbox Live.

1900
02:32:42,265 --> 02:32:45,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be interested to see if that's still the case in two weeks.

1901
02:32:45,329 --> 02:32:48,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Delistings do not require human intervention.

1902
02:32:48,453 --> 02:32:50,176
[SPEAKER_08]: If they wanted something delisted, it's gone.

1903
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:57,003
[SPEAKER_08]: either that or legal marketing whoever deals with this at Konami just plain fucked up.

1904
02:32:57,763 --> 02:32:58,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

1905
02:32:58,764 --> 02:32:59,524
[SPEAKER_08]: You delist it.

1906
02:32:59,744 --> 02:33:02,225
[SPEAKER_08]: You either schedule a delisting or you take it down.

1907
02:33:02,265 --> 02:33:04,666
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no ifs, ands, or buts about this.

1908
02:33:05,827 --> 02:33:09,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just thinking back to the Skullgirl stuff last week and it seemed like it was staggered on the two.

1909
02:33:10,730 --> 02:33:15,952
[SPEAKER_08]: That had a contractual end though so they wouldn't do it before then and everybody was aware that that was actually going to happen.

1910
02:33:16,132 --> 02:33:19,334
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just straight delisting for a game that games that

1911
02:33:19,614 --> 02:33:20,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably don't even really need it.

1912
02:33:21,115 --> 02:33:24,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and Simpsons was a PlayStation Plus free game for a while.

1913
02:33:24,197 --> 02:33:26,019
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I got it, which I find interesting.

1914
02:33:27,960 --> 02:33:31,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, sadly, not going to be able to get that anymore.

1915
02:33:31,643 --> 02:33:35,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if it's still on their servers, though, so if I delete the game from my drive, can I actually get the game back?

1916
02:33:35,846 --> 02:33:37,427
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, oh shit, I think I did delete it.

1917
02:33:37,487 --> 02:33:38,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if I can get it back.

1918
02:33:39,008 --> 02:33:39,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

1919
02:33:40,069 --> 02:33:40,689
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, take it away.

1920
02:34:06,843 --> 02:34:08,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this one was to me.

1921
02:34:08,984 --> 02:34:14,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Jamie, I was offended on your behalf for the email bashing you guys for voicing your opinion on the VGX show.

1922
02:34:14,547 --> 02:34:21,070
[SPEAKER_02]: What benefit do people get from writing into talk shows to bash commentators for their thoughts?

1923
02:34:22,330 --> 02:34:23,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't really offended.

1924
02:34:24,551 --> 02:34:27,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Reagan's policies didn't actually destroy the economy.

1925
02:34:27,733 --> 02:34:29,233
[SPEAKER_02]: They saved it from the gas lines at the Carter.

1926
02:34:29,393 --> 02:34:32,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it set the pace for the thing we have now.

1927
02:34:32,995 --> 02:34:34,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Too much politics.

1928
02:34:34,855 --> 02:34:36,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Syntax error.

1929
02:34:36,556 --> 02:34:36,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Ready.

1930
02:34:38,376 --> 02:34:40,676
[SPEAKER_02]: He also built the foundation for the prosperity we saw in the 90s.

1931
02:34:40,736 --> 02:34:44,357
[SPEAKER_02]: It took Clinton and Bush number two to really ruin the economy, and Nickelback doesn't completely suck.

1932
02:34:44,397 --> 02:34:45,217
[SPEAKER_02]: They only kind of suck.

1933
02:34:46,317 --> 02:34:48,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the great show, Labrat Y2K.

1934
02:34:50,478 --> 02:34:54,279
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a laundry list of internet insult memes right there.

1935
02:34:55,299 --> 02:34:59,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I could argue the politics behind that with some hard numbers, but I will not.

1936
02:35:01,162 --> 02:35:02,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Got one from...

1937
02:35:04,702 --> 02:35:15,209
[SPEAKER_02]: CK Ender Hey OLR, I'll start by saying I've been a loyal podcast listener for about two years and I hope you'll keep doing what you're doing as you guys are an integral part of my Monday afternoons.

1938
02:35:15,630 --> 02:35:21,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I won't be criticized too harshly on grammar, but something I heard on the show this past weekend 12-15-13 stuck with me.

1939
02:35:22,134 --> 02:35:26,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that this topic is too political to read on the show, but I felt like I had to write this.

1940
02:35:26,437 --> 02:35:33,181
[SPEAKER_02]: When you folks mentioned the NSA is spying on our MMOs, I felt like there is a bit of misinformation on the lack of information you've been provided with.

1941
02:35:35,143 --> 02:35:37,664
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a more global reach to what they are doing.

1942
02:35:37,804 --> 02:35:42,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not only to listen for communications of any terrorist activities or things of that nature.

1943
02:35:42,766 --> 02:35:51,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a known fact that in 2011, North Korea formed several farms for well gold, which it was selling the proceeds of funding their nuclear weapons program.

1944
02:35:51,611 --> 02:35:52,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was that too.

1945
02:35:57,349 --> 02:36:04,635
[SPEAKER_02]: The practice is comparable to diamond trafficking from Africa to fund warlords or the opium trades in the Middle East funding any of the terrorist groups there.

1946
02:36:05,136 --> 02:36:19,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm not employed by the NSA or any government agency for that matter, but it's been speculated that what they are doing is making purchases from these gold sellers and tracking the funds in an effort to shut down the operations and thus limiting the funds of our national adversaries.

1947
02:36:20,449 --> 02:36:27,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, people may think it's a waste of taxpayers' money to have people sit around and play WoW, but frankly, if it can help financially disarm a nuclear program, then why not?

1948
02:36:28,154 --> 02:36:29,155
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very good point.

1949
02:36:29,936 --> 02:36:34,679
[SPEAKER_02]: The age we live in is not only an age of physical conflict, but wars are fought in cyberspace as well.

1950
02:36:35,059 --> 02:36:40,823
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that this is just coming to open news does not mean it's not something that has been going on for ages.

1951
02:36:41,163 --> 02:36:42,984
[SPEAKER_02]: The example I cited earlier is not the only one.

1952
02:36:43,104 --> 02:36:49,829
[SPEAKER_02]: China has been using prisons to farm gold for sellers in several MMOs, while being, of course, the predominant one due to its population.

1953
02:36:50,509 --> 02:36:59,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once a player purchases from any gold seller, it opens them up for identity fraud, thus providing further resources such as additional funds, social security numbers, ID, and things of that sort.

1954
02:37:00,612 --> 02:37:05,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And as tensions grow tighter in international affairs, it's reasonable that the government looks into this.

1955
02:37:05,573 --> 02:37:07,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of all the folks who buy gold on a daily basis.

1956
02:37:07,954 --> 02:37:16,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Players may feel they're getting ahead in a video game, but they may also be unknowingly funding nuclear warfare, foreign governments, and any other number of illicit trades or activities.

1957
02:37:16,516 --> 02:37:22,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I stop here for a minute, just real quick, just because I have to say this, because as a big time MMO player and all this, this really bugs me.

1958
02:37:22,818 --> 02:37:24,938
[SPEAKER_09]: People need to stop buying gold online.

1959
02:37:25,219 --> 02:37:32,761
[SPEAKER_09]: People need to realize what, and I don't necessarily think every time they're buying gold, they're necessarily funding all of this.

1960
02:37:32,901 --> 02:37:40,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to discredit the emailer's opinion, because I think it's a very well thought out point, and I think this emailer brings up some good points that are completely valid.

1961
02:37:41,244 --> 02:37:46,347
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just think we need, as MMO players, to stop buying gold in the first place.

1962
02:37:46,407 --> 02:37:50,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Because not only is it necessarily funding this stuff, but it's funding the theft of accounts.

1963
02:37:50,950 --> 02:37:55,613
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funding these companies that will do anything to get the gold in-game, including compromise accounts.

1964
02:37:55,914 --> 02:37:58,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're usually putting your own self at risk.

1965
02:37:58,515 --> 02:38:02,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not buy third-party currency in these games.

1966
02:38:02,318 --> 02:38:04,540
[SPEAKER_09]: You are part of the problem if you're doing that.

1967
02:38:05,140 --> 02:38:06,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it not worth it.

1968
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:21,641
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm saying.

1969
02:38:21,721 --> 02:38:23,162
[SPEAKER_09]: We all have to take that responsibility.

1970
02:38:23,182 --> 02:38:23,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it not worth it.

1971
02:38:23,603 --> 02:38:24,924
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm right, I believe it was abandoned.

1972
02:38:25,324 --> 02:38:26,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Educate other players.

1973
02:38:27,146 --> 02:38:29,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let me get back into... Where was I?

1974
02:38:29,147 --> 02:38:29,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1975
02:38:31,890 --> 02:38:37,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So to say at the NSA there are a bunch of spies spying on Americans, as some people have, is not entirely accurate.

1976
02:38:37,374 --> 02:38:47,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I wouldn't say they are looking on the average player who can leak information or communicate with terrorist cells, but to limit the financial gain of any group or nation who wishes to fund themselves in this nature.

1977
02:38:47,483 --> 02:38:48,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good point.

1978
02:38:48,784 --> 02:38:49,024
[SPEAKER_02]: But I...

1979
02:38:51,733 --> 02:38:58,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think, however, that the attempts to do so in the past have been as successful as they were probably hoping it would be.

1980
02:38:59,637 --> 02:39:01,218
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my thought, but I'll continue.

1981
02:39:01,478 --> 02:39:09,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe if there was a little less transparency, there'd be more people kind of quick to believe that if they could see this value that you're pointing out.

1982
02:39:10,043 --> 02:39:16,687
[SPEAKER_09]: But to be fair, I mean, we're kind of making assumptions to agree with this emailer too.

1983
02:39:16,907 --> 02:39:18,788
[SPEAKER_09]: There's assumptions all around, right?

1984
02:39:18,808 --> 02:39:18,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1985
02:39:19,308 --> 02:39:21,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read the next part.

1986
02:39:21,989 --> 02:39:26,591
[SPEAKER_02]: As for the right to do this, a thing that happened shortly after 9-11 called the Patriot Act.

1987
02:39:27,572 --> 02:39:28,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a whole other can of worms.

1988
02:39:28,992 --> 02:39:31,633
[SPEAKER_02]: The bill passed with very little contest from anyone, praised by millions.

1989
02:39:32,073 --> 02:39:34,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Those who spoke out against it were chastised and berated.

1990
02:39:34,855 --> 02:39:38,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It essentially gave the NSA power to do whatever they wish in the defense of terrorism.

1991
02:39:43,238 --> 02:39:52,309
[SPEAKER_02]: While I do not know where the hosts of the show stand on that topic in particular, we sit here 12 years later chastising the NSA for doing something the nation encouraged them to do in the first place.

1992
02:39:52,789 --> 02:40:00,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself was completely against that because it seemed like a big knee-jerk reaction as many people in this country are apt to do.

1993
02:40:01,713 --> 02:40:20,716
[SPEAKER_02]: while I don't have a problem with surveillance as long as there is transparency that the surveillance is happening I'm perfectly fine with that I would have no problem with CCTV all over the place because honestly the only people who should be worried about having their stuff tracked are people who have something to hide

1994
02:40:21,278 --> 02:40:25,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Not all, I mean, not to, again, not to get too political, but just something to think about.

1995
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:28,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Not all surveillance is necessarily bad.

1996
02:40:28,641 --> 02:40:29,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's an example.

1997
02:40:30,082 --> 02:40:32,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it when the mall parking lot has surveillance.

1998
02:40:32,903 --> 02:40:35,164
[SPEAKER_09]: So that if something happens to my car, it's on tape.

1999
02:40:35,184 --> 02:40:36,104
[SPEAKER_02]: You have it on tape.

2000
02:40:37,605 --> 02:40:46,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what about for those hotels that have CCTV and caught, you know, murders happening or, you know, people being attacked.

2001
02:40:46,229 --> 02:40:49,530
[SPEAKER_02]: What about that whole, what's that called, the knockout game thing?

2002
02:40:51,141 --> 02:40:57,890
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know when you're going to the mall, maybe the criminals are too dumb to remember, but you know you're probably going to be on film.

2003
02:40:58,190 --> 02:41:03,377
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's when that privacy, that reasonable expectation for privacy is breached that people get pissed off.

2004
02:41:03,658 --> 02:41:08,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think a lot of people assumed that the cybering they were doing in MMO games was private.

2005
02:41:11,041 --> 02:41:13,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, honestly, and I'm just going to say this right now.

2006
02:41:14,244 --> 02:41:21,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem with having my dirty laundry out there because, honestly, the fuck they don't care.

2007
02:41:21,372 --> 02:41:22,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's get started, girl.

2008
02:41:22,913 --> 02:41:23,334
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

2009
02:41:23,914 --> 02:41:24,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you know what I mean.

2010
02:41:25,776 --> 02:41:28,759
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if they have my...

2011
02:41:29,620 --> 02:41:31,261
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2012
02:41:51,832 --> 02:41:52,533
[SPEAKER_02]: and send me back.

2013
02:41:52,773 --> 02:41:53,814
[SPEAKER_02]: That's seriously how it went.

2014
02:41:54,054 --> 02:41:56,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ran away from home a couple of times because fuck that place.

2015
02:41:57,438 --> 02:41:59,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, this email got a lot.

2016
02:41:59,379 --> 02:41:59,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2017
02:42:00,280 --> 02:42:02,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care who knows that.

2018
02:42:03,143 --> 02:42:03,964
[SPEAKER_09]: It's part of who you are now.

2019
02:42:04,084 --> 02:42:05,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's got something.

2020
02:42:05,706 --> 02:42:07,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me the awesome person I am today.

2021
02:42:08,588 --> 02:42:13,290
[SPEAKER_02]: In closing, I do love the show and appreciate that you give everyone a voice and remain subjective.

2022
02:42:13,730 --> 02:42:17,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I will happily continue to listen so long as the show continues to be open-minded.

2023
02:42:17,432 --> 02:42:20,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide me with hours of video game news and overall entertainment.

2024
02:42:20,233 --> 02:42:22,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, CK Ender.

2025
02:42:23,134 --> 02:42:25,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record, I was not a troublemaker in school.

2026
02:42:25,935 --> 02:42:29,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I got in one fight that anyone saw that had a witness.

2027
02:42:30,296 --> 02:42:31,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you say your mama got scared?

2028
02:42:33,744 --> 02:42:34,865
[SPEAKER_02]: By me having one fight?

2029
02:42:35,786 --> 02:42:37,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I know what you mean now.

2030
02:42:37,288 --> 02:42:39,530
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't Fresh Prince.

2031
02:42:39,690 --> 02:42:42,313
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I didn't have lots of visits to the principal's office.

2032
02:42:42,373 --> 02:42:44,094
[SPEAKER_02]: My problems were strictly at home.

2033
02:42:44,955 --> 02:42:52,502
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was this one girl who was just irritating the shit out of me, throwing... Because I was the, you know, the gothy, geeky...

2034
02:42:53,163 --> 02:42:54,084
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2035
02:43:18,641 --> 02:43:23,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, to go back to the email, I just will say I have an open mind with that email.

2036
02:43:23,484 --> 02:43:26,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to suck up, but just, you know, at the end there, I do have an open mind to that email.

2037
02:43:26,646 --> 02:43:28,327
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was a well-presented perspective.

2038
02:43:29,148 --> 02:43:29,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2039
02:43:30,089 --> 02:43:43,577
[SPEAKER_08]: It paints a very good alternative to something that has been a truth for the last decade and not just the, oh God, NSA spying that every governmental black box is being shoved into in the last year.

2040
02:43:43,637 --> 02:43:47,140
[SPEAKER_09]: It paints a good devil's advocate perspective we weren't able to do last week.

2041
02:43:48,261 --> 02:44:00,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say though, we do have some chat comments of course over at live.vognetwork.com Let's see, what was the comment about MM2K in chat says, okay, that's World of Warcraft but what about their Xbox Live spying?

2042
02:44:00,331 --> 02:44:01,332
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the justification?

2043
02:44:02,943 --> 02:44:26,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Dungeon Buster says if it involves telecommunications you can always assume that there will be someone out there trying to find a way to tap it NSA's had its wrist slapped as far back as the 70s there was congressional outrage and then nothing happened until the next scandal this is not their first rodeo Ranma says they've been doing this for years and now people are acting out about it fuck out of here so interesting perspectives all over let's move on to the next email though for time's sake

2044
02:44:28,372 --> 02:44:30,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was actually the end of that email regardless.

2045
02:44:30,613 --> 02:44:32,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you for the well-thought-out email.

2046
02:44:32,575 --> 02:44:33,095
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two left.

2047
02:44:33,155 --> 02:44:35,176
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is still UT, but it's not long.

2048
02:44:35,857 --> 02:44:36,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guys.

2049
02:44:36,777 --> 02:44:38,338
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all... Good job editing, first off.

2050
02:44:38,719 --> 02:44:38,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2051
02:44:38,939 --> 02:44:41,601
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, count me among the people who actually like Nickelback.

2052
02:44:42,021 --> 02:44:46,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the greatest band in the world, but they're enjoyable enough and don't deserve nearly the level of crap they get.

2053
02:44:46,364 --> 02:44:47,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Next email.

2054
02:44:47,444 --> 02:44:48,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

2055
02:44:48,285 --> 02:44:48,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

2056
02:44:48,805 --> 02:44:49,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

2057
02:44:49,225 --> 02:44:49,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

2058
02:44:50,547 --> 02:44:56,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, while the show is mostly enjoyable, I have to bring up the continued ignoring of all the other services while looking at the feed of Gabe Newell.

2059
02:44:57,374 --> 02:44:57,794
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2060
02:44:57,954 --> 02:45:01,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like Steam, so I'm using what I like, so whatever.

2061
02:45:02,259 --> 02:45:11,429
[SPEAKER_02]: While I don't ask that you ignore Steam sales, they're clearly exciting for Steam's user base, but the way you and most other games media go on, people would be forgiven for thinking that Steam...

2062
02:45:11,889 --> 02:45:13,750
[SPEAKER_02]: was all that mattered in the PC space.

2063
02:45:13,890 --> 02:45:26,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, you guys are ignoring the massive GOG holiday sales where over 600 plus titles going up to half off are the massive 48-hour free Fallout giveaway they did.

2064
02:45:26,978 --> 02:45:28,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know about it until you just said that.

2065
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:31,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I took advantage of that.

2066
02:45:32,161 --> 02:45:33,182
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that, Loki?

2067
02:45:33,722 --> 02:45:34,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I took advantage of that.

2068
02:45:34,823 --> 02:45:35,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't you tell me?

2069
02:45:37,981 --> 02:45:41,324
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also sales on Indie Game Stand, Humble Store, and Desura.

2070
02:45:41,764 --> 02:45:49,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, the only time you guys have ever mentioned anything other than a Steam sale was not on Steam sale, was basically developers trying to drum up support for getting greenlit.

2071
02:45:50,154 --> 02:46:11,682
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way there was one that Catastrophic Moggy linked me to that I can't remember it was a UK site that takes international funds but had a Doctor Who game on there that I was very close to getting but I cannot for the life of me remember the URL now I just want to say though you mentioned Humble or the emailer mentioned Humble Store and we cover almost every single Humble bundle that comes out because they're always such great deals and they give Steam keys yeah

2072
02:46:12,302 --> 02:46:27,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll mention that the last Steam sale, or maybe the one before last, I was mentioning a lot about Amazon had better deals and even I think Gamefly was doing some deals and stuff that were better than what was on the Steam store.

2073
02:46:28,161 --> 02:46:30,124
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of alternatives out there.

2074
02:46:31,735 --> 02:46:38,479
[SPEAKER_09]: And just a blanket statement that the reason why Steam tends to get the most coverage is Steam is the most prolific.

2075
02:46:39,039 --> 02:46:46,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And not to belittle what the other stores are doing, but keep in mind that Steam is trying to do things that are beyond the storefront.

2076
02:46:46,885 --> 02:46:48,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love good old games.

2077
02:46:49,266 --> 02:46:52,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's great that there's a method set up for some of those classics.

2078
02:46:53,189 --> 02:46:54,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I love my classics.

2079
02:46:54,470 --> 02:46:55,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I love good old games.

2080
02:46:55,611 --> 02:47:00,734
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm glad to hear they're having sales and a lot of that stuff is available.

2081
02:47:01,234 --> 02:47:06,979
[SPEAKER_09]: But keep in mind that Steam also is pushing things forward with the trading card thing.

2082
02:47:07,379 --> 02:47:08,761
[SPEAKER_09]: With the family sharing.

2083
02:47:09,101 --> 02:47:10,722
[SPEAKER_09]: With the operating system.

2084
02:47:10,782 --> 02:47:21,011
[SPEAKER_09]: And even though you might not necessarily be a fan of any of that, you can't deny that these are things that are pushing stores in general in another direction.

2085
02:47:21,451 --> 02:47:24,253
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why they tend to dominate the coverage.

2086
02:47:24,734 --> 02:47:26,775
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit of a two-edged sword.

2087
02:47:27,416 --> 02:47:28,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know what he's getting at.

2088
02:47:29,197 --> 02:47:37,860
[SPEAKER_08]: You make a very fair point in the sense that there is a lot of non-monetary news like Steam Machine announcement and everything else that's been happening.

2089
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:44,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Steam does a ton of new things that are making landslide, that are making waves in the news.

2090
02:47:44,883 --> 02:47:56,387
[SPEAKER_08]: That said, I said just myself today, I picked up Electronic Super Joy for $1.50 and You Don't Know Jack for $5 and we do off the cuff these games that we got for dirt cheap from Steam.

2091
02:47:57,387 --> 02:48:00,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Way more often than any other vendor out there.

2092
02:48:00,249 --> 02:48:03,290
[SPEAKER_08]: So I 100% agree with his point.

2093
02:48:04,351 --> 02:48:14,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I interject the fact that news is important too, but I completely agree that we definitely do bias Steam for our look at our deals, look at our steals kind of thing.

2094
02:48:15,126 --> 02:48:15,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Three comments.

2095
02:48:16,548 --> 02:48:20,251
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, we've mentioned GOG in the past.

2096
02:48:20,291 --> 02:48:22,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind he does have a deep dislike towards Steam.

2097
02:48:23,214 --> 02:48:29,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad from PodCulture says, 75% of my Steam stuff comes from the humble bundles and the rest from huge sales they have.

2098
02:48:29,501 --> 02:48:30,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And FifthDream says, Indie Royale.

2099
02:48:32,113 --> 02:48:33,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think I bought one of their bundles once.

2100
02:48:33,914 --> 02:48:34,314
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.

2101
02:48:34,775 --> 02:48:36,756
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, not to belittle the email.

2102
02:48:37,176 --> 02:48:40,478
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fair point that don't all sales deserve equal coverage.

2103
02:48:40,618 --> 02:48:49,284
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this show sometimes, and this has come up on another topic, tends to be a reflection of what gamers are talking about.

2104
02:48:49,504 --> 02:48:52,446
[SPEAKER_09]: And Steam, you know, look at whatever gaming blogs are out there.

2105
02:48:52,846 --> 02:48:55,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Steam does typically dominate that coverage.

2106
02:48:55,848 --> 02:49:25,537
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm all for, you know what, if there's this great indie thing going on and you guys email in about it or tweet us or get it to our attention I'm all about getting this stuff exposure, absolutely we have no problem mentioning any of this, it just happens to be whatever we've kind of and honestly, there's just sometimes I pull up Steam just to peruse their you know, library, find something completely bizarre and go that's freaking weird, like that what was that game, Loki, the ballpoint shooter

2107
02:49:27,491 --> 02:49:30,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, let's see, that was... Because I bought it.

2108
02:49:31,633 --> 02:49:33,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to look it up now because I don't remember.

2109
02:49:33,693 --> 02:49:37,094
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, uh, Ballpoint, Ballpoint Universe Infinite.

2110
02:49:37,494 --> 02:49:37,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2111
02:49:37,594 --> 02:49:40,996
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was one of, like, some green light game that looked pretty cool.

2112
02:49:41,236 --> 02:49:44,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a neat concept, so it was like, two bucks, click.

2113
02:49:44,757 --> 02:49:46,197
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had that lovely wallet.

2114
02:49:46,217 --> 02:49:46,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Loki.

2115
02:49:47,978 --> 02:49:48,438
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

2116
02:49:48,994 --> 02:49:50,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I have used it all up yesterday.

2117
02:49:53,577 --> 02:49:59,301
[SPEAKER_02]: To continue with the email, which is nearly done, again, I feel the need to reiterate that I don't have anything against people who like Steam.

2118
02:49:59,461 --> 02:50:06,546
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the media blackout on anything that isn't Steam only serves to undermine what should be an open platform, essentially turning it into a Valve console.

2119
02:50:07,486 --> 02:50:15,772
[SPEAKER_02]: While I hope you guys don't take this as offensive, and I rarely do, though I imagine people are already shit-talking me in your chat.

2120
02:50:17,463 --> 02:50:19,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Only a little bit, but not really.

2121
02:50:19,785 --> 02:50:20,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say shit.

2122
02:50:21,106 --> 02:50:21,766
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wouldn't either.

2123
02:50:21,806 --> 02:50:23,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say I put around the line of a juicy fart.

2124
02:50:25,348 --> 02:50:25,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

2125
02:50:26,709 --> 02:50:30,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have zero problem with Raw Steel UT personally.

2126
02:50:30,732 --> 02:50:34,234
[SPEAKER_09]: When points are presented succinctly like this?

2127
02:50:34,254 --> 02:50:36,576
[SPEAKER_02]: He makes good points that may not always be popular.

2128
02:50:36,776 --> 02:50:44,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and I'm all for hearing the points that may not be popular when they're presented in a tactful manner.

2129
02:50:45,043 --> 02:50:46,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it has to go.

2130
02:50:46,805 --> 02:50:50,147
[SPEAKER_09]: When it's fuck you, you fucking fuck, I'm not going to hear it, but he doesn't do that.

2131
02:50:51,168 --> 02:51:02,677
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and see, I have no problem with information being presented to me that may be kind of the opposite of what I think, as long as it's presented in an intellectually and fact-based manner.

2132
02:51:02,737 --> 02:51:04,519
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of two emails tonight that have done that.

2133
02:51:04,939 --> 02:51:05,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, and I love it.

2134
02:51:06,100 --> 02:51:06,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I freaking love it.

2135
02:51:07,561 --> 02:51:13,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's why I actually look at progressive Republican websites.

2136
02:51:13,269 --> 02:51:14,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I told you that.

2137
02:51:14,791 --> 02:51:17,555
[SPEAKER_02]: To look for the conservative point of view.

2138
02:51:17,715 --> 02:51:19,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I listen to conservative talk radio.

2139
02:51:19,157 --> 02:51:20,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Done from an intelligent manner.

2140
02:51:23,082 --> 02:51:27,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, what I hear isn't always intelligent, but some of it's pretty good.

2141
02:51:30,828 --> 02:51:32,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Just know that I still enjoy your show.

2142
02:51:33,069 --> 02:51:34,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just asking for a teeny bit more fairness.

2143
02:51:35,271 --> 02:51:36,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Regards, Rostel UT.

2144
02:51:36,432 --> 02:51:36,852
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

2145
02:51:37,473 --> 02:51:38,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love me some Lady Gaga.

2146
02:51:38,794 --> 02:51:40,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a huge fan of Beyonce, though.

2147
02:51:41,936 --> 02:51:43,117
[SPEAKER_02]: You are entitled to that opinion.

2148
02:51:43,157 --> 02:51:44,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, his music tastes are redeemed a little bit, at least.

2149
02:51:45,859 --> 02:51:47,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like calling Beyonce bejesus.

2150
02:51:48,140 --> 02:51:48,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, beezus.

2151
02:51:50,222 --> 02:51:51,783
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because that was Beezus and Ramona.

2152
02:51:56,387 --> 02:51:57,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't go there.

2153
02:51:57,569 --> 02:51:58,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to call her bejesus.

2154
02:51:58,530 --> 02:52:00,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were my books growing up.

2155
02:52:00,132 --> 02:52:02,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if we were going to do the J with the Y sounds, it's bejesus.

2156
02:52:04,213 --> 02:52:04,673
[SPEAKER_09]: More emails?

2157
02:52:04,914 --> 02:52:05,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2158
02:52:05,274 --> 02:52:05,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Last one.

2159
02:52:05,874 --> 02:52:06,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Last one.

2160
02:52:06,375 --> 02:52:06,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

2161
02:52:07,295 --> 02:52:08,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, OLR.

2162
02:52:08,416 --> 02:52:09,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

2163
02:52:09,416 --> 02:52:10,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

2164
02:52:10,597 --> 02:52:16,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sending you a very last minute email this week with a timely theme with a question and a response to my own question.

2165
02:52:16,741 --> 02:52:17,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

2166
02:52:18,202 --> 02:52:19,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here we go.

2167
02:52:19,803 --> 02:52:20,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Ellipse.

2168
02:52:21,144 --> 02:52:33,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that the Steam Winter Sale is underway until 1-3-14, what five games per person response that are on sale you think everyone should buy provided that they don't already have said games and that they actually afford to buy them?

2169
02:52:33,752 --> 02:52:36,413
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to appreciate the irony of this email.

2170
02:52:36,434 --> 02:52:38,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Juxtaposition wins.

2171
02:52:38,315 --> 02:52:39,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking do.

2172
02:52:39,255 --> 02:52:39,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking do.

2173
02:52:39,835 --> 02:52:45,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Ross Steele, even though you're sitting there rolling your eyes to the back of your head right now, you have to appreciate the irony.

2174
02:52:45,539 --> 02:52:50,481
[SPEAKER_02]: There are three letters on Ross Steele UT's forehead right now, and it's S-M-H.

2175
02:52:51,002 --> 02:52:52,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

2176
02:52:53,849 --> 02:52:56,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I will go ahead and read our readers.

2177
02:52:56,831 --> 02:52:57,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's Spazinator, by the way.

2178
02:52:57,912 --> 02:52:58,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2179
02:52:58,972 --> 02:52:59,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Ragenator now.

2180
02:53:00,393 --> 02:53:02,694
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I recommend the following games in no particular order.

2181
02:53:03,195 --> 02:53:10,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Flat Out, Magic 2014 Special Edition, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, Strike Suit Zero Mega Bundle, and Pinball FX Two Tables.

2182
02:53:10,999 --> 02:53:11,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Any or all of them.

2183
02:53:12,580 --> 02:53:13,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Any and all of them.

2184
02:53:14,341 --> 02:53:14,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Rob.

2185
02:53:14,962 --> 02:53:15,322
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say?

2186
02:53:15,702 --> 02:53:19,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Civ V, Spelunky, Rogue Legacy...

2187
02:53:25,476 --> 02:53:28,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Hexagon, Path of Exile in the free-to-play section

2188
02:53:43,547 --> 02:53:49,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably going to go with the Stanley Parable because it's on sale right now.

2189
02:53:50,133 --> 02:53:52,094
[SPEAKER_02]: The Angry Video Game Nerd game.

2190
02:53:52,615 --> 02:53:56,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty fun little platformer, especially if you're a fan of his reviews.

2191
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:00,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also go with DuckTales.

2192
02:54:00,942 --> 02:54:01,342
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on sale.

2193
02:54:03,272 --> 02:54:08,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I already have it, I'm just saying for people who don't have it right now, it's on sale, so go get it.

2194
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:11,721
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was I playing?

2195
02:54:14,965 --> 02:54:19,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Bioshock Infinite, which I haven't started yet, but I'm still excited about playing it.

2196
02:54:20,370 --> 02:54:33,979
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'd actually say Dragon Age Origins because it's five bucks now for the whatever great version is and I have me some elves to play as.

2197
02:54:35,580 --> 02:54:42,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, I don't know if he can think of five Steam games or after the email before any PC platform games that are worth checking out right now?

2198
02:54:44,145 --> 02:54:48,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I would probably go with that stuff because depending on what you have already I

2199
02:54:49,721 --> 02:55:19,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Borderlands 2 if you don't have that already Bioshock Infinite probably oh let's see Skyrim I mean if you don't have Skyrim good point Just Cause 2 only when it goes on the flash sale because it is only 7 it's funny it was on sale for more than it is now on sale for so but just because of the multiplayer mod

2200
02:55:20,338 --> 02:55:24,841
[SPEAKER_07]: and I guess maybe Surgeon Simulator 2013.

2201
02:55:26,942 --> 02:55:27,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason?

2202
02:55:28,863 --> 02:55:35,667
[SPEAKER_08]: My overlap is pretty funny, but You Don't Know Jack, Starbound, Rogue Legacy, Just Cause 2, and Papers, Please.

2203
02:55:36,367 --> 02:55:38,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I need to check out Papers, Please myself.

2204
02:55:39,449 --> 02:55:45,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Tech2030 in chat says, even though people don't call it a real using Cody Fingers game, I'm going to say Gone Home.

2205
02:55:45,872 --> 02:55:46,713
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another good pick.

2206
02:55:47,193 --> 02:55:48,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I need to start that.

2207
02:55:48,914 --> 02:55:49,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2208
02:55:49,608 --> 02:55:53,369
[SPEAKER_02]: But if anybody out there doesn't have the Stanley Parable, freaking get it.

2209
02:55:54,169 --> 02:55:55,370
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on my list of things to check out.

2210
02:55:55,450 --> 02:55:56,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I have it.

2211
02:55:56,250 --> 02:55:57,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought it in the last sale.

2212
02:55:57,471 --> 02:55:58,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just things to check out during this week.

2213
02:55:58,911 --> 02:56:00,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember if I actually picked it up or not.

2214
02:56:00,672 --> 02:56:01,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I want to.

2215
02:56:01,392 --> 02:56:02,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I want to check it out.

2216
02:56:02,392 --> 02:56:03,172
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 11 bucks right now.

2217
02:56:03,472 --> 02:56:05,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft suggesting Dust and Elysian Tale.

2218
02:56:06,353 --> 02:56:10,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And some folks in chat commenting, Loki, are you wrapping a present in the background?

2219
02:56:10,555 --> 02:56:11,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we can hear it.

2220
02:56:12,162 --> 02:56:12,682
[SPEAKER_09]: My wife is.

2221
02:56:13,122 --> 02:56:13,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

2222
02:56:14,023 --> 02:56:14,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Nelly.

2223
02:56:14,983 --> 02:56:16,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Merry Christmas to whoever.

2224
02:56:16,704 --> 02:56:20,486
[SPEAKER_09]: You might just want to mute yourself locally on Skype like you when you're not talking just so we don't hear the rapping.

2225
02:56:20,506 --> 02:56:21,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

2226
02:56:21,126 --> 02:56:21,606
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

2227
02:56:22,847 --> 02:56:25,548
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes some getting used to when you do it in person for so long.

2228
02:56:26,007 --> 02:56:26,327
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2229
02:56:27,689 --> 02:56:28,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Where else are we at?

2230
02:56:29,450 --> 02:56:30,511
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for that email, right?

2231
02:56:31,232 --> 02:56:31,892
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the last email.

2232
02:56:31,912 --> 02:56:32,513
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for emails.

2233
02:56:32,853 --> 02:56:36,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future.

2234
02:56:36,577 --> 02:56:41,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully we'll get some nice – like I would love to see two emails that counter each other back to back.

2235
02:56:41,161 --> 02:56:42,522
[SPEAKER_09]: We need more of that in future weeks.

2236
02:56:42,882 --> 02:56:43,863
[SPEAKER_09]: That's always hilarious.

2237
02:56:43,883 --> 02:56:44,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are my favorite.

2238
02:56:45,324 --> 02:57:09,850
[SPEAKER_09]: some other just some more comments from chat and this is just PC gaming in general really William Murderface saying don't forget Guild Wars 2 if you're looking for a different MMO experience I think they're running a promotion right now I got an email from them that might be directly through ArenaNet for that Cial says Reprisal is a good populist clone that's still being worked on did I say Actdeft's Dust and Elysian Tale if I didn't then I said it again I guess all right

2239
02:57:10,450 --> 02:57:10,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Divekick.

2240
02:57:11,150 --> 02:57:13,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also say Duke Nukem.

2241
02:57:14,051 --> 02:57:17,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember Duke Nukem 3D, I think, was down to two bucks, like the old school one.

2242
02:57:17,752 --> 02:57:19,113
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have multiplayer and beta now.

2243
02:57:19,253 --> 02:57:20,953
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be in the flash sale at 2am.

2244
02:57:21,133 --> 02:57:22,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I'll be up checking.

2245
02:57:23,174 --> 02:57:28,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week, because we're mad, even though it's the holidays.

2246
02:57:28,415 --> 02:57:29,876
[SPEAKER_09]: The holidays bring out the worst in us.

2247
02:57:46,209 --> 02:57:47,670
[SPEAKER_11]: F you, Rob, because Crivello.

2248
02:57:49,271 --> 02:58:08,181
[SPEAKER_02]: No, right now my voice is kind of going out, and I have stuff I have to do this week, and also I'm a little bit jealous that my computer hasn't been upgraded when Dan's was, but I understand our friend that was helping us out has become quite ill, and it's going around, so just feel better soon.

2249
02:58:09,702 --> 02:58:10,322
[SPEAKER_02]: See you, George.

2250
02:58:11,383 --> 02:58:15,025
[SPEAKER_02]: You're awesome for doing this for us, and thank you for helping us pick out bits for our computers.

2251
02:58:15,305 --> 02:58:15,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Feel better, George.

2252
02:58:16,627 --> 02:58:18,349
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some little banter on Twitter now and again.

2253
02:58:19,250 --> 02:58:23,996
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I'm going to have like 50 bajillion USB ports on the front of my computer or something like that.

2254
02:58:24,056 --> 02:58:24,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2255
02:58:25,598 --> 02:58:26,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go next.

2256
02:58:26,259 --> 02:58:29,983
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week goes to... I think I pulled a muscle last night while I was sleeping because...

2257
02:58:30,584 --> 02:58:33,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I was super drunk last night!

2258
02:58:51,892 --> 02:59:00,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't have a hangover today, and Alan did, so I will say thank you to whatever is out there watching over me for not giving me a hangover today.

2259
02:59:00,137 --> 02:59:01,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless your hydration and your liver.

2260
02:59:01,638 --> 02:59:02,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, try to teach me a lesson.

2261
02:59:02,839 --> 02:59:05,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I did have a bottle of water before I left the place.

2262
02:59:05,780 --> 02:59:06,501
[SPEAKER_09]: That was probably smart.

2263
02:59:06,621 --> 02:59:10,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell everybody this, just a piece of advice.

2264
02:59:10,803 --> 02:59:18,488
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a B50 complex and drink a glass of water before you're going to have a night of frivolous drinking, frivol-o-drinking too, Mm-hmm.

2265
02:59:19,108 --> 02:59:24,017
[SPEAKER_02]: You are less likely to have a hangover and also invest in ginger pills because they do help with nausea.

2266
02:59:28,332 --> 02:59:56,600
[SPEAKER_09]: S2100 Matt in chat says we gotta get Grandpa on OLR actually it's funny you bring that up we are he offered yesterday to do a live show from San Francisco at his place and I actually think that's something we could swing because ironically enough Jason's in San Francisco right now so we just down the street for him so I'm thinking around the time that Loki's gonna be out because the baby's here that might be a good time for Jamie and I to get in the car go to San Francisco we might actually do that as long as I haven't started my job

2267
02:59:57,710 --> 02:59:58,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

2268
02:59:59,271 --> 03:00:06,233
[SPEAKER_09]: It is actually a possibility in OLR Roadshow because if we're in San Francisco, we might be able to get some really great guests in studio.

2269
03:00:06,253 --> 03:00:07,533
[SPEAKER_02]: We know who else is going to be there.

2270
03:00:08,613 --> 03:00:09,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I know.

2271
03:00:09,674 --> 03:00:12,914
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's on the list.

2272
03:00:12,954 --> 03:00:13,795
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I'm going to say.

2273
03:00:15,295 --> 03:00:15,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your turn.

2274
03:00:16,956 --> 03:00:23,237
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I guess F you to my mouth because it's still a little bit sore from surgery.

2275
03:00:24,098 --> 03:00:24,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you eat real food?

2276
03:00:24,798 --> 03:00:25,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I can eat food now.

2277
03:00:27,637 --> 03:00:30,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, glad to hear you're getting better though Jason

2278
03:00:31,087 --> 03:00:40,011
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to the stupid cough I still can't quite kick and has also seemed to want to be more prolific despite cough drops in the last 30 minutes, hours, something like that.

2279
03:00:40,371 --> 03:00:44,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure all this talking is not exactly helping it terribly well, but you know, whatever.

2280
03:00:46,074 --> 03:00:51,756
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to money, again, just kind of in general, but more specifically, GE Financial.

2281
03:00:52,017 --> 03:00:58,920
[SPEAKER_08]: They're dumb and the fact that they make it so hard for me to be able to actually see bills and manage finances...

2282
03:00:59,820 --> 03:01:00,701
[SPEAKER_08]: You're making it hard.

2283
03:01:01,401 --> 03:01:05,364
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going against the ability for utilities to actually make things easier.

2284
03:01:05,465 --> 03:01:07,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Credit, you know, debt planning, that kind of stuff.

2285
03:01:08,007 --> 03:01:09,508
[SPEAKER_08]: GE Financial, FU.

2286
03:01:09,668 --> 03:01:10,849
[SPEAKER_08]: FU.

2287
03:01:10,989 --> 03:01:13,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, awkward moments in public.

2288
03:01:14,111 --> 03:01:18,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at the post office and there were customers that decided to get into...

2289
03:01:19,395 --> 03:01:22,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Not literally, but verbal fisticuffs with each other.

2290
03:01:22,536 --> 03:01:30,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was insanely awkward, and I had to make sure that I didn't want to jump in and try to pacify it, because I would not have pacified it.

2291
03:01:30,500 --> 03:01:33,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't have done anything, but I would not have pacified it.

2292
03:01:33,601 --> 03:01:34,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I just would have gotten involved.

2293
03:01:36,663 --> 03:01:43,789
[SPEAKER_08]: There is inevitably a mental illness that spearheaded a large portion of this, which is unfortunate.

2294
03:01:44,250 --> 03:01:45,911
[SPEAKER_08]: But the moment itself, F you.

2295
03:01:47,913 --> 03:01:48,413
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2296
03:01:50,035 --> 03:01:53,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us start to wrap up the show here with just a couple more stories.

2297
03:01:53,437 --> 03:01:55,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2298
03:01:55,859 --> 03:02:00,163
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, you can still call 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2299
03:02:00,183 --> 03:02:01,424
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not there just yet.

2300
03:02:01,464 --> 03:02:03,126
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a couple more stories for you guys first.

2301
03:02:03,186 --> 03:02:03,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

2302
03:02:04,281 --> 03:02:31,703
[SPEAKER_07]: yes and since we talked about the VGX over the last few weeks the final numbers are in they had 1.1 million views which exceeded their expectations and they said there was a lot of great feedback that came out of it and sure there's people calling for the date and time of my suicide and this is Jeff Keeley but there were people who also said very constructive things about the show and um

2303
03:02:32,967 --> 03:02:37,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like that it was a success and they're planning on doing it next year as well.

2304
03:02:38,468 --> 03:02:40,949
[SPEAKER_07]: They said people from 109 countries tuned in.

2305
03:02:42,149 --> 03:02:49,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Average viewer spending 32 minutes watching it, which is funny because it's about the time I watched it, about 30 minutes.

2306
03:02:52,131 --> 03:02:54,231
[SPEAKER_09]: So you were Joe Average in that case?

2307
03:02:55,292 --> 03:02:55,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess so.

2308
03:02:55,912 --> 03:02:57,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that your cat?

2309
03:02:58,322 --> 03:02:59,123
[SPEAKER_07]: That is my cat.

2310
03:02:59,183 --> 03:03:03,189
[SPEAKER_07]: She just got let out of because she was getting into all the rapping stuff.

2311
03:03:03,209 --> 03:03:04,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be the locker in the middle bedroom.

2312
03:03:05,152 --> 03:03:08,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And she comes out and does her cry and stuff.

2313
03:03:09,699 --> 03:03:09,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Aww.

2314
03:03:11,181 --> 03:03:13,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she's a douchebag sometimes.

2315
03:03:14,545 --> 03:03:21,950
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like the VGX was really well rated so it probably is coming back next year despite anything we might have said that week it aired.

2316
03:03:22,730 --> 03:03:25,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe without Joel McHale this time would be my guess.

2317
03:03:26,513 --> 03:03:31,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Or more like the version that was on TV which was totally edited and different but we'll see.

2318
03:03:31,676 --> 03:03:42,283
[SPEAKER_07]: They should do like a Aisha Tyler or something like that because she's actually kind of into games and stuff and you know I think that would be pretty good and maybe you know

2319
03:03:42,759 --> 03:03:44,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe give some comedy lessons to Jeff there.

2320
03:04:12,341 --> 03:04:14,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they actually made a documentary about this.

2321
03:04:14,222 --> 03:04:17,664
[SPEAKER_09]: And I seem to remember talking about this on a show before, that this documentary was in progress.

2322
03:04:18,085 --> 03:04:24,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the Canadian film production company, Fuel Industries, actually is going to this landfill to try to find all the cartridges.

2323
03:04:25,049 --> 03:04:27,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, you're going to find a bunch of melted plastic.

2324
03:04:27,090 --> 03:04:28,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, whatever.

2325
03:04:28,551 --> 03:04:38,037
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, this whole thing is going to happen from this film company, and they're actually going to release a documentary on Xbox on 2014.

2326
03:04:38,077 --> 03:04:38,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2327
03:04:39,438 --> 03:04:40,818
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you like documentaries?

2328
03:05:09,366 --> 03:05:11,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, I actually watch quite a number of them.

2329
03:05:11,728 --> 03:05:18,032
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, yesterday I watched a whole series about the medieval attitude towards marriage, birth, and death.

2330
03:05:20,233 --> 03:05:24,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the change of the Anglican Reformation.

2331
03:05:25,697 --> 03:05:28,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Would they call that Romney documentary the biggest loser?

2332
03:05:30,493 --> 03:05:30,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, stop.

2333
03:05:31,034 --> 03:05:34,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just called Red Entertainment said we didn't find shit in the documentary where we don't find shit.

2334
03:05:35,139 --> 03:05:37,902
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably will find some shit, but not the shit you're looking for.

2335
03:05:37,922 --> 03:05:39,725
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be like when Geraldo opened that tomb.

2336
03:05:39,845 --> 03:05:41,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking that.

2337
03:05:42,949 --> 03:05:44,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking that.

2338
03:05:44,551 --> 03:05:45,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, nothing.

2339
03:05:46,454 --> 03:05:46,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2340
03:05:49,756 --> 03:05:51,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.

2341
03:05:51,557 --> 03:05:55,120
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a big bomb and everyone's going to be like, yay, bomb.

2342
03:05:56,100 --> 03:05:58,582
[SPEAKER_09]: That is it for the news.

2343
03:05:59,383 --> 03:06:06,347
[SPEAKER_09]: We are about to go to the Skype line, but since I do have to free up the Skype line for the night, this is the part of the show where we're going to say goodbye to Loki.

2344
03:06:07,488 --> 03:06:09,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, thanks for being here on the show tonight.

2345
03:06:10,110 --> 03:06:10,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a problem.

2346
03:06:11,391 --> 03:06:15,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any final... Well, first I should ask, do you have any quick last minute stories for our listeners or...

2347
03:06:16,021 --> 03:06:16,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one small one.

2348
03:06:16,901 --> 03:06:18,762
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Grand Theft Auto 5 related.

2349
03:06:18,822 --> 03:06:23,884
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be... Actually, it was kind of leaked out that there's going to be some Christmas DLC.

2350
03:06:24,204 --> 03:06:36,848
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already started patching it in, and if you happen to be playing Grand Theft Auto Online, if you look up at the sky, you'll notice that some light snow is falling, and pretty soon that light snow is going to turn into heavy snow as we get towards Christmas.

2351
03:06:37,469 --> 03:06:44,231
[SPEAKER_07]: So, full snow in Los Santos, and there's going to be some...

2352
03:06:45,216 --> 03:06:45,836
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not really.

2353
03:06:45,856 --> 03:06:47,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Just have a good holiday, everyone.

2354
03:07:04,096 --> 03:07:04,376
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2355
03:07:04,636 --> 03:07:08,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thanks for being here tonight, Loki, and take care of yourself and best of luck.

2356
03:07:08,198 --> 03:07:09,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And rub your wife's feet.

2357
03:07:09,839 --> 03:07:10,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2358
03:07:10,299 --> 03:07:10,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Rub your wife's feet.

2359
03:07:10,920 --> 03:07:11,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I already am.

2360
03:07:11,300 --> 03:07:11,940
[SPEAKER_07]: She's sitting right here.

2361
03:07:12,321 --> 03:07:12,661
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2362
03:07:13,101 --> 03:07:13,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Nellie.

2363
03:07:13,621 --> 03:07:14,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye, Nellie.

2364
03:07:14,202 --> 03:07:14,382
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2365
03:07:14,402 --> 03:07:14,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye, you guys.

2366
03:07:14,902 --> 03:07:15,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

2367
03:07:15,802 --> 03:07:16,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2368
03:07:16,183 --> 03:07:17,443
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2369
03:07:17,543 --> 03:07:19,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, I don't know if he'll pop in chat.

2370
03:07:19,064 --> 03:07:20,785
[SPEAKER_09]: He might show up in chat a little later in the show.

2371
03:07:20,825 --> 03:07:21,165
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

2372
03:07:21,566 --> 03:07:22,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was already in chat.

2373
03:07:22,906 --> 03:07:23,127
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2374
03:07:23,167 --> 03:07:25,888
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the meantime, Jamie's going to answer this call.

2375
03:07:26,248 --> 03:07:26,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I am?

2376
03:07:26,648 --> 03:07:28,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because Alan just brought dinner.

2377
03:07:28,790 --> 03:07:29,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I want dinner.

2378
03:07:29,470 --> 03:07:30,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So sorry about it.

2379
03:07:31,491 --> 03:07:32,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is OLR.

2380
03:07:32,872 --> 03:07:33,312
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

2381
03:07:34,993 --> 03:07:35,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

2382
03:07:36,094 --> 03:07:36,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Actdeft.

2383
03:07:37,675 --> 03:07:39,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for visiting my village.

2384
03:07:39,476 --> 03:07:40,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you still love Animal Crossing.

2385
03:07:42,037 --> 03:07:43,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I still play it on occasion.

2386
03:07:44,259 --> 03:07:52,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as much as I did a few months ago, but I may pick it up again to do the rest of the stuff I haven't done.

2387
03:07:52,724 --> 03:07:55,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought Big Dan into making a tent in my village.

2388
03:07:56,621 --> 03:07:57,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I saw it.

2389
03:07:57,381 --> 03:07:58,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the tent.

2390
03:07:58,662 --> 03:08:02,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And I left Dan a present, too.

2391
03:08:02,164 --> 03:08:03,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a letter and a present.

2392
03:08:04,885 --> 03:08:05,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's up tonight?

2393
03:08:06,666 --> 03:08:11,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a little follow-up to the email RossDLUT sent.

2394
03:08:13,170 --> 03:08:22,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, there's a lot of sites that sell or do bundles, sell games for cheap.

2395
03:08:24,124 --> 03:08:26,908
[SPEAKER_01]: PRM, Steam Activated, and all that stuff.

2396
03:08:28,990 --> 03:08:40,505
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a few mentioned in chat, like Indie Royale, that sell bundles for games that are recently developed or recently released.

2397
03:08:41,323 --> 03:08:48,969
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty cool games and they're activated on Steam and they have also Viscera-activated games and DRM-free.

2398
03:08:50,050 --> 03:09:00,239
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also another page I mentioned in chat earlier, Indiegala, that also sells DRM-free games.

2399
03:09:00,519 --> 03:09:04,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now they have Euro Truck Simulator 2.

2400
03:09:08,747 --> 03:09:12,155
[SPEAKER_01]: They are free and steam activated for like pretty cheap like

2401
03:09:12,796 --> 03:09:13,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm

2402
03:09:43,237 --> 03:09:43,677
[SPEAKER_01]: How so?

2403
03:09:44,758 --> 03:09:50,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is it that gaming websites in general tend to focus more on Steam than anything else?

2404
03:09:53,123 --> 03:09:54,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically because it's the most popular.

2405
03:09:55,704 --> 03:10:00,707
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really popular out there and there's millions maybe that use Steam.

2406
03:10:02,448 --> 03:10:04,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And even that's pretty much that started it all.

2407
03:10:05,630 --> 03:10:07,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically popularity.

2408
03:10:09,136 --> 03:10:24,550
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many sites that cover deals and stuff that we all know, CheapAssGamer, and they hold their Twitter feed, and they post about deals and stuff from...

2409
03:10:24,890 --> 03:10:34,035
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of places, not only Steam, like Amazon, Green Man Gaming, that's also a pretty good site for deals, even cheaper than Steam and Amazon.

2410
03:10:35,736 --> 03:10:46,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Brave New World expansion for Civilization V for cheaper than Steam has it, so it's a pretty great site too, and they also sell DRM-free stuff.

2411
03:10:49,265 --> 03:10:51,607
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, it's all popularity.

2412
03:10:53,389 --> 03:11:05,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, since all the games that are sold on all those sites are activated in Steam, so basically it's like, you already have it, so why not?

2413
03:11:07,146 --> 03:11:07,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

2414
03:11:08,307 --> 03:11:10,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I think also all the extra stuff Steam has to do.

2415
03:11:10,928 --> 03:11:14,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, building the achievements and the friend talks and everything, that's kind of smart too.

2416
03:11:15,211 --> 03:11:23,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I realize like Desura has some of that and some of the other competitors, but I think that goes a long way too in making Steam a little more than just a store.

2417
03:11:24,432 --> 03:11:34,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I'm, you know, I understand that we should kind of, you know, tip a hat to everybody that's got a really great sale going on, although I don't think we could ever possibly cover every great sale in gaming.

2418
03:11:35,162 --> 03:11:37,284
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it is why people tend to focus on Steam.

2419
03:11:38,124 --> 03:11:40,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So, anyway, Actdeft, before we let you go, any other thoughts?

2420
03:11:43,077 --> 03:11:47,042
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another site that I recently discovered that's called Groupies.

2421
03:11:47,923 --> 03:11:58,054
[SPEAKER_01]: G-R-O-U-P-E-W-E-S.com That also sells not only games, they also sell music.

2422
03:11:58,835 --> 03:12:00,618
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have pretty good, great bundles.

2423
03:12:01,079 --> 03:12:03,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another one to check out.

2424
03:12:03,422 --> 03:12:07,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't they also host the MAGFest donation slash award drive?

2425
03:12:07,408 --> 03:12:09,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2426
03:12:09,391 --> 03:12:12,275
[SPEAKER_01]: They did the MAGFest bundle and I bought that.

2427
03:12:12,575 --> 03:12:13,637
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty great bundle.

2428
03:12:13,976 --> 03:12:16,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, it's always a great time.

2429
03:12:17,579 --> 03:12:23,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Every day is a good day for consumers because there's always so many new fantastic things.

2430
03:12:25,205 --> 03:12:29,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of them specialize in ways that may align with your interests more.

2431
03:12:29,569 --> 03:12:31,271
[SPEAKER_08]: So seek them out and support them.

2432
03:12:31,571 --> 03:12:32,872
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it boils down to.

2433
03:12:34,778 --> 03:12:36,699
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

2434
03:12:36,719 --> 03:12:37,639
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you so much for the call.

2435
03:12:38,540 --> 03:12:38,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2436
03:12:38,920 --> 03:12:39,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy holidays.

2437
03:12:39,781 --> 03:12:40,421
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care.

2438
03:12:40,721 --> 03:12:41,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy holidays.

2439
03:12:41,301 --> 03:12:43,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2440
03:12:43,322 --> 03:12:46,764
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2441
03:12:47,424 --> 03:12:50,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try to pull up the Twitter here real quick while I'm in between bites of my dinner.

2442
03:12:51,486 --> 03:12:52,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but we do have another call coming in.

2443
03:12:53,047 --> 03:12:54,468
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Jason, you ready to answer this one?

2444
03:12:54,488 --> 03:12:55,148
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready to answer this.

2445
03:12:55,208 --> 03:12:55,809
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, you ready?

2446
03:12:56,269 --> 03:12:57,329
[SPEAKER_09]: You fill that host role.

2447
03:12:57,530 --> 03:12:58,170
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here we go.

2448
03:12:58,370 --> 03:13:02,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Another call on the line while I chow down on some sweet and sour chicken over here.

2449
03:13:02,572 --> 03:13:03,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I will do so.

2450
03:13:03,352 --> 03:13:03,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, caller.

2451
03:13:03,972 --> 03:13:04,373
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your name?

2452
03:13:04,433 --> 03:13:05,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Who are you calling from?

2453
03:13:05,393 --> 03:13:06,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are you calling from?

2454
03:13:06,713 --> 03:13:07,774
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Ranma from Brooklyn.

2455
03:13:07,814 --> 03:13:08,094
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

2456
03:13:08,114 --> 03:13:10,374
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ranma from that place on the opposite side of the U.S.

2457
03:13:10,874 --> 03:13:11,535
[SPEAKER_10]: I sent you a card.

2458
03:13:12,715 --> 03:13:13,195
[SPEAKER_10]: You got what?

2459
03:13:13,775 --> 03:13:14,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I sent you a card.

2460
03:13:15,276 --> 03:13:15,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

2461
03:13:16,116 --> 03:13:17,837
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be getting your gift tomorrow.

2462
03:13:21,474 --> 03:13:28,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Appropriate for the Christmas spirit, the holiday spirit, the non-dominational spirit, denominational as well.

2463
03:13:29,197 --> 03:13:30,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Words are hard.

2464
03:13:30,398 --> 03:13:33,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people like to be dominated.

2465
03:13:34,539 --> 03:13:35,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Robby, tell us something.

2466
03:13:36,420 --> 03:13:37,040
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Romna?

2467
03:13:37,881 --> 03:13:40,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, a couple of things I want to cover.

2468
03:13:40,542 --> 03:13:41,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting the hell up on out of here.

2469
03:13:41,922 --> 03:13:46,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the whole PAX Diversity Lounge thing, I'm not happy.

2470
03:13:48,393 --> 03:13:54,066
[SPEAKER_08]: This does not come as any bit of a surprise but what's your take on it in addition to what we covered previously?

2471
03:13:55,132 --> 03:14:08,323
[SPEAKER_05]: As someone who's gone to cons for years and also staffs conventions as well, this whole diversity lounge thing, I just feel it's not the responsibility of the convention to have these lounges set up.

2472
03:14:09,103 --> 03:14:13,166
[SPEAKER_05]: If this should be done, let somebody else come in and handle it.

2473
03:14:13,246 --> 03:14:15,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the con have someone to monitor.

2474
03:14:16,629 --> 03:14:17,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just it.

2475
03:14:17,830 --> 03:14:20,392
[SPEAKER_05]: They shouldn't be dictating how things should go.

2476
03:14:20,672 --> 03:14:20,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Because...

2477
03:14:21,853 --> 03:14:25,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I just see nothing but bad juju coming out of this.

2478
03:14:25,717 --> 03:14:30,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially considering the source of the drama is the con organizers themselves.

2479
03:14:31,462 --> 03:14:37,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I personally, I give them more or less a pass because I'm very understanding about various things.

2480
03:14:37,227 --> 03:14:41,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people feel that I shouldn't, but it's my thought train.

2481
03:14:41,291 --> 03:14:42,732
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my logic that, you know.

2482
03:14:46,002 --> 03:14:51,705
[SPEAKER_08]: But you are of the opinion that this is something that should exist, just executed slightly differently.

2483
03:14:52,686 --> 03:14:57,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I don't know if you noticed, but there's been a lot of crazy shit going on with conventions.

2484
03:14:57,189 --> 03:15:04,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, there was one con where a girl was sexually assaulted, and the convention just dropped the entire ball about that.

2485
03:15:05,054 --> 03:15:06,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, they sucked.

2486
03:15:06,915 --> 03:15:08,656
[SPEAKER_12]: I read that and was so pissed off.

2487
03:15:09,257 --> 03:15:13,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and there are con staffers I speak to that run other conventions...

2488
03:15:14,815 --> 03:15:21,683
[SPEAKER_05]: about a third of them say that the con's not at fault here and that really started a shitstorm but that's for another time

2489
03:15:22,574 --> 03:15:25,837
[SPEAKER_08]: And this isn't even just a convention thing in the strictest sense.

2490
03:15:25,997 --> 03:15:44,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, that's where the biggest news and availability comes out because this is a massive group of people and things of this nature can, unfortunately, get caught in not even the noise but also the news and that these little things have to really bubble up to become a big deal.

2491
03:15:44,212 --> 03:15:44,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I...

2492
03:15:46,735 --> 03:15:57,956
[SPEAKER_08]: is this something I've never been to a con that has something like that there will be panels but has there ever been a fixed presence in any con you've been to to address these issues

2493
03:15:59,111 --> 03:15:59,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at all.

2494
03:16:00,271 --> 03:16:05,673
[SPEAKER_05]: The closest I've been to a convention where we had something like this was Otakon years ago.

2495
03:16:06,214 --> 03:16:09,975
[SPEAKER_05]: We had what was called the Black Cosplayers Social Thread.

2496
03:16:10,175 --> 03:16:13,856
[SPEAKER_05]: The point of this was for a bunch of black cosplayers to get together and hang out.

2497
03:16:13,876 --> 03:16:16,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, we don't see each other.

2498
03:16:16,337 --> 03:16:22,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But we kept saying, it's for everyone to join, but it's just for us to get together and hang out, you know, because we don't see each other.

2499
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:27,341
[SPEAKER_05]: That was going good for a couple of years until somebody got offended and started the...

2500
03:16:28,061 --> 03:16:35,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of surprised that there was another list of minorities, although I obviously get a fair amount of the reference in that last group that you just mentioned.

2501
03:16:52,225 --> 03:16:56,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was supposed to be a joke to prove that everybody was being ridiculous about it.

2502
03:16:57,229 --> 03:17:00,511
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more like just to get together and have a good time.

2503
03:17:00,531 --> 03:17:03,213
[SPEAKER_05]: This was something that we were planning more or less.

2504
03:17:03,273 --> 03:17:10,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if the con itself had gotten involved, it probably would have gotten a hell of a lot worse before all this even happened.

2505
03:17:11,659 --> 03:17:15,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Yours had a theme but not an exclusion, not a restriction.

2506
03:17:15,772 --> 03:17:16,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

2507
03:17:16,293 --> 03:17:23,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the whole diversity, I see the similarities, but I just see still it's going to cause a problem.

2508
03:17:26,242 --> 03:17:28,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I said on a friend's Facebook.

2509
03:17:29,885 --> 03:17:31,086
[SPEAKER_05]: They're diversifying everything.

2510
03:17:31,266 --> 03:17:40,215
[SPEAKER_05]: That means us folk, we're going to be at the back of the convention center on dial-up while everybody else is going to be at the front of the convention center on shitty Wi-Fi.

2511
03:17:42,348 --> 03:18:05,593
[SPEAKER_08]: uh despite despite the difference in mediums still makes a pretty uh pretty significant difference and yeah it's a it's a as we said it's only creating a prejudice zone because that whatever people feel that they'll be there you know it will only be these individuals there in the first place in large part anything else on your mind

2512
03:18:07,173 --> 03:18:08,395
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more things.

2513
03:18:08,475 --> 03:18:13,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to agree with DarkSakura about the whole DDR and exercise thing because I did that for a while.

2514
03:18:13,483 --> 03:18:16,408
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR, four times a day, took vitamins.

2515
03:18:16,428 --> 03:18:18,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up dropping like 20 pounds, so I dislocated my knee.

2516
03:18:19,801 --> 03:18:31,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, when I first, the first DDR that Dan ever bought me, the first one I physically owned that wasn't a burn was Second Mix on Dreamcast.

2517
03:18:32,065 --> 03:18:45,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And over that summer, since my birthday in April, I dropped something like 10 to 15 pounds and completely, I had had some torn tendons in my foot from college in Alabama and completely healed my foot.

2518
03:18:46,289 --> 03:18:46,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

2519
03:18:47,270 --> 03:18:52,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, there is such a thing as overdoing and pushing yourself a bit too hard.

2520
03:18:55,015 --> 03:18:57,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I think with any exercise, one needs to be careful.

2521
03:18:57,757 --> 03:18:59,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly, as it was in your case, too.

2522
03:19:00,198 --> 03:19:04,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I dislocated my knee for other reasons, but... So, DDR is safe!

2523
03:19:05,382 --> 03:19:06,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

2524
03:19:06,923 --> 03:19:08,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I banged my head on the monitor once.

2525
03:19:09,224 --> 03:19:09,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sorry.

2526
03:19:09,705 --> 03:19:10,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean to overstep you.

2527
03:19:10,745 --> 03:19:11,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2528
03:19:11,566 --> 03:19:11,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

2529
03:19:12,130 --> 03:19:12,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, you.

2530
03:19:13,270 --> 03:19:13,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2531
03:19:13,991 --> 03:19:17,772
[SPEAKER_05]: When I got out of the hospital, my first thought was, well, fuck, can I play DDR again?

2532
03:19:17,792 --> 03:19:19,513
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the first thing that came to mind.

2533
03:19:20,193 --> 03:19:20,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2534
03:19:21,014 --> 03:19:30,457
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one time, and Rob, I think you were there, when I got dizzy playing, at the time I was on sevens, and I slipped forward and hit my head on the machine.

2535
03:19:30,858 --> 03:19:31,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I was there.

2536
03:19:32,018 --> 03:19:34,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got up and finished it.

2537
03:19:34,099 --> 03:19:35,119
[SPEAKER_09]: That was scary, though.

2538
03:19:35,640 --> 03:19:37,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this big red welt on my forehead.

2539
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:38,621
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty fun, though.

2540
03:19:38,721 --> 03:19:38,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2541
03:19:39,441 --> 03:19:43,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can look back at it and laugh now, and I wasn't scared because I was focused on playing.

2542
03:19:43,944 --> 03:19:45,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But everyone else was like, oh, my God.

2543
03:19:46,046 --> 03:19:47,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, scary.

2544
03:19:47,787 --> 03:19:52,530
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can probably take one more call and then wrap up for the night.

2545
03:19:52,550 --> 03:19:53,290
[SPEAKER_09]: But thanks for calling.

2546
03:19:53,670 --> 03:19:55,492
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, before I go, I'm just going to say this.

2547
03:19:56,612 --> 03:20:02,436
[SPEAKER_05]: For allowing Anime Jam Session on VOG, for helping us out and all the good stuff, I have here a shot of...

2548
03:20:04,277 --> 03:20:04,838
[SPEAKER_05]: of Sake.

2549
03:20:04,858 --> 03:20:09,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say on behalf of Anime Jam Session to OLR, thanks for everything.

2550
03:20:09,260 --> 03:20:11,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy holidays and happy new year.

2551
03:20:11,261 --> 03:20:13,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I've got a glass of water.

2552
03:20:13,642 --> 03:20:16,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason has a Pepsi Wild Cherry and DarkSakura has her iPhone.

2553
03:20:16,864 --> 03:20:17,825
[SPEAKER_09]: We're toasting right now.

2554
03:20:17,885 --> 03:20:18,305
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2555
03:20:18,385 --> 03:20:18,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Toast.

2556
03:20:18,665 --> 03:20:22,267
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to send Jamie a picture of the sake that I took a shot out of.

2557
03:20:22,407 --> 03:20:22,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2558
03:20:22,988 --> 03:20:23,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2559
03:20:23,408 --> 03:20:23,628
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2560
03:20:23,668 --> 03:20:24,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

2561
03:20:24,168 --> 03:20:24,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one.

2562
03:20:25,129 --> 03:20:25,489
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

2563
03:20:25,649 --> 03:20:25,929
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2564
03:20:25,969 --> 03:20:26,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2565
03:20:27,350 --> 03:20:29,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I am done shoving Chinese food down my throat.

2566
03:20:29,811 --> 03:20:31,231
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really good, just saying.

2567
03:20:31,251 --> 03:20:31,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled good.

2568
03:20:31,971 --> 03:20:32,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

2569
03:20:32,991 --> 03:20:34,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel so rude eating in front of you guys.

2570
03:20:34,472 --> 03:20:38,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, you offered, and I said no, and then I realized all I had today was a salad and some cheese.

2571
03:20:38,913 --> 03:20:40,233
[SPEAKER_09]: You realized the mistake you made.

2572
03:20:40,293 --> 03:20:40,953
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

2573
03:20:41,033 --> 03:20:43,234
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just I couldn't see anything that wasn't sugary.

2574
03:20:43,454 --> 03:20:44,214
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2575
03:20:44,274 --> 03:20:47,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Since I am done eating, I will take this last call.

2576
03:20:47,595 --> 03:20:48,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Sausage Radio.

2577
03:20:48,515 --> 03:20:48,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2578
03:20:49,415 --> 03:20:50,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is Brad from PodCulture.

2579
03:20:50,855 --> 03:20:52,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Brad from PodCulture.

2580
03:20:52,536 --> 03:20:53,076
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

2581
03:20:53,667 --> 03:20:58,691
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura talking about my avatar there Alright, settle down so Brad can get his thought out What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2582
03:21:17,465 --> 03:21:28,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, y'all don't talk too much about mobile games, but I had to call in and tell you about a mobile game that's kind of become crack for Christina and I here of late.

2583
03:21:29,395 --> 03:21:32,738
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Doctor Who Legacy, and it's on iOS and Android.

2584
03:21:33,278 --> 03:21:34,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you told me about that.

2585
03:21:34,859 --> 03:21:36,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to find this.

2586
03:21:36,681 --> 03:21:41,845
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much a bejeweled clone, but they got all kinds of little unlocks and...

2587
03:21:42,571 --> 03:21:46,393
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can unlock different characters and costumes and levels and all that kind of crap.

2588
03:21:46,753 --> 03:21:52,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just something that makes it like crack.

2589
03:21:53,077 --> 03:21:54,217
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't stop playing it.

2590
03:21:54,478 --> 03:21:55,198
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Doctor.

2591
03:21:56,279 --> 03:22:00,781
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's interesting, though, is that usually those Doctor Who games don't really get very good reviews.

2592
03:22:00,821 --> 03:22:02,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, weren't there some on, like, the DS or whatever?

2593
03:22:03,282 --> 03:22:05,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, there was one on DS.

2594
03:22:05,324 --> 03:22:06,484
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Top Trumps game.

2595
03:22:06,664 --> 03:22:08,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Top Trumps, and that was all right.

2596
03:22:09,086 --> 03:22:10,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone sent it to me.

2597
03:22:11,803 --> 03:22:15,384
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one that was on PSN that was kind of bad.

2598
03:22:16,204 --> 03:22:18,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the Eternity Clock or something, I think, of what it was.

2599
03:22:18,685 --> 03:22:20,706
[SPEAKER_00]: The rules weren't so great.

2600
03:22:20,746 --> 03:22:25,187
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one, if you like Bejeweled or those kind of games, and you like Doctor Who, it's perfect.

2601
03:22:26,148 --> 03:22:28,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the Mazes of Time game somewhere.

2602
03:22:29,609 --> 03:22:32,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was kind of a neat little partner puzzle-solving game.

2603
03:22:33,370 --> 03:22:35,191
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, the controls were god-awful.

2604
03:22:35,491 --> 03:22:36,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't stand it.

2605
03:22:36,556 --> 03:22:40,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mind it that much, and someone had gifted it to me.

2606
03:22:41,340 --> 03:22:44,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really enjoyed it, but I didn't play very far at it.

2607
03:22:45,303 --> 03:22:47,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, this has Clara, so I'm definitely downloading it.

2608
03:22:47,525 --> 03:22:59,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, and right now they have an advent calendar type of thing where they release a code a day or a different level a day all throughout the holidays, and the one that came out today was for Sarah Jane.

2609
03:23:00,515 --> 03:23:01,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Sarah Jane!

2610
03:23:01,355 --> 03:23:01,996
[SPEAKER_02]: She's my favorite.

2611
03:23:02,557 --> 03:23:03,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's neat.

2612
03:23:03,737 --> 03:23:04,497
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free game.

2613
03:23:05,218 --> 03:23:11,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there are, of course, in-app purchases where you can buy crystals and crap to level up a little faster.

2614
03:23:11,139 --> 03:23:12,479
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to pay a cent for it.

2615
03:23:13,059 --> 03:23:22,561
[SPEAKER_00]: And the developer's been really good at communication because I've had a couple of issues where I've had to email them twice and they've responded really fast within hours.

2616
03:23:23,602 --> 03:23:24,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's cool.

2617
03:23:24,622 --> 03:23:25,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I'm actually downloading it now.

2618
03:23:26,722 --> 03:23:28,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

2619
03:23:28,683 --> 03:23:30,283
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth checking out, especially for free.

2620
03:23:31,158 --> 03:23:36,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm fairly addicted to Bejeweled on my phone, so maybe this will fill in my addiction.

2621
03:23:37,644 --> 03:23:46,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't mind at all talking about mobile phone games here on the show, and especially one that I kind of think would be of interest to nerds out there.

2622
03:23:46,712 --> 03:23:52,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's probably a lot of people out there that not only like video games, but like their Doctor Who as well, so...

2623
03:23:53,257 --> 03:23:59,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just wanted to call in and mention that in case folks hadn't heard about it and check it out.

2624
03:23:59,379 --> 03:24:00,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have to ask.

2625
03:24:01,039 --> 03:24:01,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2626
03:24:01,459 --> 03:24:02,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch Day of the Doctor?

2627
03:24:03,580 --> 03:24:05,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I went to the theater and saw it.

2628
03:24:05,620 --> 03:24:08,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get the sniffles at the end?

2629
03:24:10,182 --> 03:24:16,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little disappointed that we didn't see the whole... You talking about with John Hurt?

2630
03:24:16,723 --> 03:24:17,424
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

2631
03:24:17,724 --> 03:24:18,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about with Curator.

2632
03:24:19,557 --> 03:24:20,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Night of the Doctor

2633
03:24:34,984 --> 03:24:36,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was pretty good, too, because I love Paul McGann.

2634
03:24:37,086 --> 03:24:41,068
[SPEAKER_09]: On a scale of 1 to 10, how excited are you for the Christmas episode?

2635
03:24:42,009 --> 03:24:45,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, anything that brings me more Clara is a pin.

2636
03:24:46,331 --> 03:24:47,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that gets rid of Matt Smith.

2637
03:24:47,933 --> 03:24:53,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hey, there's a reason we named the cat Clara.

2638
03:24:53,416 --> 03:24:59,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like Matt Smith's Doctor, but I love David Tennant, but nobody tops Tom Baker.

2639
03:24:59,498 --> 03:25:02,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even really watch the show, but Peter Capaldi looks very interesting.

2640
03:25:02,959 --> 03:25:04,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's going to be a great Doctor.

2641
03:25:05,300 --> 03:25:10,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, he's going to be great, and the little cameo he had in the anniversary special was awesome.

2642
03:25:10,702 --> 03:25:11,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, that was great.

2643
03:25:12,442 --> 03:25:16,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad, before we let you go, do you want to give a quick plug for this week's Pod Culture coming up tomorrow on VOG?

2644
03:25:17,704 --> 03:25:20,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just the second half of our...

2645
03:25:23,959 --> 03:25:24,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

2646
03:25:44,654 --> 03:25:47,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, I can't wait to hear it because I love me some guilty pleasure movies.

2647
03:25:47,655 --> 03:25:54,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, of course, lots of great shows all about television and movies throughout the world on Mondays here at the Voice Geeks Network.

2648
03:25:54,497 --> 03:26:03,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Critical Myth at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern, British Invaders at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, and Pod Culture with Brad right here at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

2649
03:26:03,880 --> 03:26:06,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad, thanks so much for the call and keep on gaming.

2650
03:26:06,341 --> 03:26:07,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, later guys.

2651
03:26:07,561 --> 03:26:07,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

2652
03:26:08,564 --> 03:26:09,905
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2653
03:26:32,722 --> 03:26:33,343
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have seen her.

2654
03:26:33,483 --> 03:26:36,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Grandpa was over here yesterday and I brought her out to say hi.

2655
03:26:36,546 --> 03:26:37,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, she was not happy.

2656
03:26:38,127 --> 03:26:38,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.

2657
03:26:38,428 --> 03:26:38,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Not happy.

2658
03:26:39,449 --> 03:26:44,574
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have a midnight home and Little Miss has been quite the affection whore today.

2659
03:26:45,335 --> 03:26:49,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've got the picture in my email of Ranma's sake.

2660
03:26:50,059 --> 03:26:50,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah?

2661
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:52,442
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't do shots of sake.

2662
03:26:52,502 --> 03:26:53,663
[SPEAKER_02]: You heat it and you sip it.

2663
03:26:53,843 --> 03:26:54,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2664
03:26:56,065 --> 03:26:57,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taking forever to load.

2665
03:27:17,444 --> 03:27:34,373
[SPEAKER_09]: But his tweet said, gonna have to disagree with OLR, Sky, DarkSakura There were, are, a lot of military service members on WoW, many with clearances Don't worry, I still love you guys I saw that too Yeah, I can't think that we would have come out here and said, oh, military people don't play WoW

2666
03:27:34,833 --> 03:27:55,731
[SPEAKER_09]: but maybe we had said something along the lines of you know that there isn't sensitive or sensitive people or something in there and that is a good counterpoint that hell yeah there's a lot of service members that play WoW and a lot of MMOs I mean every MMO I've ever played I meet service people in there I think it's a great way for them to have some fun and let off some steam and keep in touch

2667
03:27:58,933 --> 03:28:04,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for reminding me to say thank you to all of our service people, especially those that are having to spend the holidays overseas right now.

2668
03:28:04,997 --> 03:28:05,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your service.

2669
03:28:06,378 --> 03:28:09,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's probably several that listen to this program, so thank you all.

2670
03:28:11,001 --> 03:28:20,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me go to a tweet from Dave Falcon, who tweeted us saying, The Smithsonian Museum of American Art started collecting video games as pieces of art for museum display.

2671
03:28:20,547 --> 03:28:25,691
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool, and he links us to a story from ABC7 News, and I'm trying to bring it up here.

2672
03:28:26,592 --> 03:28:38,994
[SPEAKER_09]: the Smithsonian American Art Museum is collecting video games for its permanent collection as part of an ongoing commitment to study and preserve such games as an artistic medium now I thought that the Smithsonian already had a room for this

2673
03:28:41,460 --> 03:28:43,341
[SPEAKER_09]: or maybe I'm confusing it with another museum.

2674
03:28:43,962 --> 03:28:44,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's MoMA.

2675
03:28:45,422 --> 03:28:46,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it could be.

2676
03:28:46,143 --> 03:28:52,206
[SPEAKER_09]: I might be, but I swear somebody showed me like a room, and I thought it was a Smithsonian, but maybe not.

2677
03:28:52,607 --> 03:28:59,110
[SPEAKER_09]: But regardless, they've acquired the 2009 game Flower and the Halo 2600.

2678
03:29:00,491 --> 03:29:26,561
[SPEAKER_09]: which was the Halo hack that was done or actually it wasn't really a hack it was like a homebrew game that was done a few years ago it's kind of a neat little choice for inclusion but I think that's very cool to show like a new game for an old console is pretty cool like that a lot so yeah hey I think that's great to preserve that stuff as art I think it's just a matter of time before we have like a video game hall of fame the Metreon tried to do something like that but then they went kaput

2679
03:29:26,966 --> 03:29:34,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Well remember too though there was that touring gallery that was a video game art and I've got a couple books actually at home.

2680
03:29:36,170 --> 03:29:41,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Tetsuya says the Smithsonian had that exhibit so I guess this is more of a permanent installation there so that's pretty cool.

2681
03:29:42,233 --> 03:29:42,433
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2682
03:29:42,473 --> 03:29:43,334
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going to do it, though.

2683
03:29:43,354 --> 03:29:46,416
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to wrap up the show because we're almost to 1 a.m.

2684
03:29:46,456 --> 03:29:47,016
[SPEAKER_09]: on the East Coast.

2685
03:29:47,036 --> 03:29:47,917
[SPEAKER_09]: So we really have to wrap up.

2686
03:29:48,257 --> 03:29:49,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So sorry to the tweets I didn't get to.

2687
03:29:49,758 --> 03:29:53,300
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you have something for next week, please consider sending us an email, a tweet, or what have you.

2688
03:29:53,701 --> 03:29:56,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orange.radio.com or twitter.com slash OLR.

2689
03:29:57,323 --> 03:30:00,125
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is that time for us to go around and wrap up for the night.

2690
03:30:01,205 --> 03:30:03,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, thank you as always for being here throughout the month.

2691
03:30:04,107 --> 03:30:06,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Glad we could have you participate with some stories tonight.

2692
03:30:06,649 --> 03:30:07,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope you had a good time.

2693
03:30:07,489 --> 03:30:08,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the first, won't be the last.

2694
03:30:09,110 --> 03:30:09,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Won't be the last.

2695
03:30:09,831 --> 03:30:10,271
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you.

2696
03:30:10,331 --> 03:30:14,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And it sounds like, by the way, I don't want to give too much away, but I've been doing some texting.

2697
03:30:14,794 --> 03:30:18,957
[SPEAKER_09]: The OLR show in San Francisco, it's going to happen sooner rather than later.

2698
03:30:19,257 --> 03:30:21,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that will be one convenient Sunday for me.

2699
03:30:21,618 --> 03:30:23,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it will be a Sunday when you're here.

2700
03:30:23,780 --> 03:30:28,002
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a weekend targeted, and I've been talking to Grandpa, so I think it's going to happen.

2701
03:30:28,382 --> 03:30:30,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will give you guys more details next week.

2702
03:30:30,264 --> 03:30:32,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I could give you guys a tour of my office while we're there.

2703
03:30:32,625 --> 03:30:33,165
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2704
03:30:51,235 --> 03:30:55,558
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 people either as guests or including the hosts.

2705
03:30:56,398 --> 03:31:01,280
[SPEAKER_08]: We could probably host it in my office too because we have ways of making this happen.

2706
03:31:01,560 --> 03:31:02,261
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll think of something.

2707
03:31:02,701 --> 03:31:04,082
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have fun for a week.

2708
03:31:04,162 --> 03:31:04,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Ideas.

2709
03:31:06,923 --> 03:31:10,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind, Loki's not going to be available that week, so we can't have too much fun without him.

2710
03:31:10,685 --> 03:31:11,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't have too much fun without him.

2711
03:31:11,865 --> 03:31:17,227
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also possibilities for bringing him on Skype and having his video on there, too.

2712
03:31:17,327 --> 03:31:17,787
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

2713
03:31:17,847 --> 03:31:19,288
[SPEAKER_08]: These are not impossibilities.

2714
03:31:19,428 --> 03:31:19,868
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

2715
03:31:20,008 --> 03:31:20,288
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2716
03:31:20,709 --> 03:31:23,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf wants to say, can I come?

2717
03:31:23,189 --> 03:31:23,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course you can.

2718
03:31:23,810 --> 03:31:24,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course you can.

2719
03:31:24,490 --> 03:31:30,732
[SPEAKER_09]: But don't you want to try to convince Dark Sakura to come to DragonCon and Loki to come to DragonCon so we can have an OLR DragonCon show?

2720
03:31:30,752 --> 03:31:31,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that would be even better.

2721
03:31:32,213 --> 03:31:32,493
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2722
03:31:33,514 --> 03:31:34,315
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

2723
03:31:34,775 --> 03:31:35,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait.

2724
03:31:35,155 --> 03:31:36,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, I got to get your final thought.

2725
03:31:36,276 --> 03:31:37,117
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your final thought for the night?

2726
03:31:37,137 --> 03:31:37,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid cough.

2727
03:31:37,977 --> 03:31:38,998
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2728
03:31:39,358 --> 03:31:42,340
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is thank you, Alan, for getting Chinese food.

2729
03:31:42,560 --> 03:31:43,341
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really good.

2730
03:31:43,501 --> 03:31:45,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, usually that place is kind of so-so, but tonight was really good.

2731
03:31:45,943 --> 03:31:48,825
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to tell Alan about you guys' present that I got you.

2732
03:31:48,945 --> 03:31:49,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I ran in there during the break.

2733
03:31:50,286 --> 03:31:58,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I'm hoping that Loki and Jason's presents arrive very soon because I thought they were cool.

2734
03:32:00,273 --> 03:32:01,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Your final thought tonight, miss?

2735
03:32:01,253 --> 03:32:02,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I want rotisserie chicken for dinner.

2736
03:32:03,094 --> 03:32:04,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go to Walmart and buy a chicken.

2737
03:32:04,815 --> 03:32:05,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Yummy.

2738
03:32:06,516 --> 03:32:06,876
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2739
03:32:07,176 --> 03:32:08,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had the rotisserie chickens at freaking Walmart?

2740
03:32:09,617 --> 03:32:10,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Not at Walmart.

2741
03:32:10,277 --> 03:32:11,238
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fucking amazing.

2742
03:32:11,518 --> 03:32:11,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

2743
03:32:11,978 --> 03:32:12,578
[SPEAKER_09]: From Walmart?

2744
03:32:12,919 --> 03:32:13,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2745
03:32:13,819 --> 03:32:17,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're the same ones that they're almost just like the ones from Costco.

2746
03:32:18,281 --> 03:32:18,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.

2747
03:32:18,842 --> 03:32:21,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have thought maybe like Boston Market or something.

2748
03:32:21,303 --> 03:32:21,623
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.

2749
03:32:22,103 --> 03:32:24,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2750
03:32:24,744 --> 03:32:26,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great holiday, you guys.

2751
03:32:26,664 --> 03:32:31,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever it is you celebrate, we will be back here to do it all again for the last show of the year.

2752
03:32:31,286 --> 03:32:35,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know we're going to be talking games of the year, stories of the year.

2753
03:32:35,507 --> 03:32:37,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, we got to have ourselves one of those shows.

2754
03:32:37,907 --> 03:32:40,128
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot can happen in seven days, y'all.

2755
03:32:40,648 --> 03:32:45,109
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll check in with the gaming news in seven more days here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2756
03:32:45,169 --> 03:32:46,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great week, everybody.

2757
03:32:46,450 --> 03:32:47,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that seven days?

2758
03:32:47,850 --> 03:32:48,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven days.

2759
03:32:49,271 --> 03:32:50,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven days.

2760
03:32:50,171 --> 03:32:50,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night, everybody.

2761
03:32:51,482 --> 03:32:52,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.

2762
03:33:21,469 --> 03:33:22,189
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next week.
