With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, we're gonna take it a little bit easier. Christmas is right around the corner and we're all getting presents from Nintendo, Rockstar, LucasArts, and Oretail. Help us unwrap all the goodness contained within this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this December the 22nd, 2013, episode number 532.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and gamer etc. etc. with my co-hosts. Say hello for stuff to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm wearing my Charlie the Unicorn shirt tonight.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Shun the non-believer!

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, you see what it says on the back?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What is it? It's the magical amulet. I don't remember that one.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The vortex out of his back?

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's the magical amulet, Charlie!

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's literally been like two years since I've been on YouTube.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I just watched it Friday because Julian likes Charlie the Unicorn.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Julian, by the way, is a six-year-old. Seven-year-old?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Six. Six and a half.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And you're welcome, Becky, if you're listening.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, how are things going for you?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Actually, I am pretty happy today. I am officially down one whole jean size since I started my exercise and fitness program.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You have been on quite the little weight loss quest and you've been very successful in that.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, the numbers on the scale don't matter to me as much as the inches I've gone down.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sure, it's one thing to see the numbers on the scale, it's another to put on a pair of pants that used to not fit and then they do.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, because I'm also doing a lot of weight lifting.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And the first thing that happens when you lift weights is you actually do gain weight.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But muscle burns more, it boosts your metabolism more. I have to eat a lot more, which is great because I love to eat.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Who doesn't?

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I actually had to increase my caloric intake by 200 calories.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Who doesn't? You know, my work holiday party went out for spaghetti and I was like, I can't think of a better food this time of year. Spaghetti is the best.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, anyway, I actually just weighed in today and I have lost 21 pounds since the beginning of October.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Congrats.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And I have lost roughly about two to three inches all around.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Great.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And I'm down a jean size and I'm going to start doing DDR once a week again.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So you were posting in the VOG forums about this stuff trying to get others to join you or whatever, right?

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have an account on Nerd Fitness and I linked my account on the VOG forums, but I would actually, because people coming on the new year really think I'm going to do it this time.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And then they go, no. Well, I am here to be everybody's life coach.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I actually want to do something with everybody.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't worry. Jamie will fix it.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Work harder. Lift more. Eat less.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I actually really would like to encourage and the whole reason I'm not doing this for the weight or anything, even though that was part of it, what I'm doing this for is because I actually feel a lot better.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have a lot more energy. I don't have as bad fatigue problems as I used to. I don't get sick as often.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Since this is a video game show and you mentioned that you wanted to pick up a DDR habit again once a week, do you believe that the extra gaming and the exercise, the fitness gaming and all that, do you believe that that really can help a person turn around?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I do. And I'm going to tell you why DDR, I think, is better. Because I've been studying, most of the time I do weightlifting, right?

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But there's another thing that they talk about that's called high intensity interval training, which is pretty much what DDR kind of is.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Of course, if you don't know what DDR is, Dance Dance Revolution, that game with the arrows and the floor mat.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The whole point is to push your hardest limit for like a minute and then you spend two minutes doing it at a more normal pace.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So in this case, it would be starting off with a nine footer, doing two medium or easy songs.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But it would still be important that you're still kind of like walking in between your songs and kind of keeping it going.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The other point is that if you are the one playing the game and you have a three or four song game, your first one is going to be your hard one.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Your next three are going to be your cooldowns. You do another game, hard one, three cooldowns.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So that way you're getting your heart rate up for that high interval and then you're relaxing because the human body is meant to function.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We're not meant to run and do long distance and do endurance things. We're meant to GTFO when there's an animal trying to bite us in the ass.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So we're built for fight or flight. So playing DDR, and I was thinking about this, it was like this light bulb moment.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Playing DDR is high interval and high intensity interval training.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You do, you know, you play five games of DDR, you've done 25 minutes of exercise, roughly.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
DDR itself is kind of on its way out though.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But there's still everywhere.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I know we have a lot of longtime Bimani fans that it pains to hear that, but let's be real y'all.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's not what it used to be. So, I mean, you just plan on playing the old versions or, you know, there's, yeah, you're right.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There's still arcade machines in many places.

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I mean, you can play the old versions at home. You know, I'm actually planning on modding a new dance pad again.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But I mean, I'd like to get to the arcade and get friends together and try to recapture some of the old fun, you know.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But I think in, in general, it's finding your exercise where you enjoy it.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because, I mean, the reason why I like lifting weights is I like feeling stronger.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I like being five foot two and being able to lift an 80 pound weight over my head.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's just, and my goal is by my birthday of lifting 120 pounds.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because soon that'll be a person that you can lift over your head and throw.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Exactly. I mean, I can get an 80 pound weight over my head. It's still work.

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But my goal is that by my birthday in April, I want to be deadlifting 120 pounds.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You should be able to pick up Julian at this point, right?

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We went to the park. I babysat him on Friday.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I got to move on. Hurry, hurry.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But I carried him over my head and was like throwing him into the sand pit and everything.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And I was in it, but it actually occurred to me.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You are named after the Bionic Woman after all.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This kid has gotten lighter to me because I have gotten stronger.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Nice. All right.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I didn't mean to go off on it.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No, that's okay. I don't really have much of a kickoff topic tonight. So this is fun.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We can have a little extended hellos with everybody.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But we do want to move on and introduce our other co-host who's been sitting there patiently waiting to be introduced.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Joining us via Skype tonight, everybody, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, I'm at home.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hey, how you doing, Loki?

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm doing fine.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You were too lazy to come to the show tonight.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You were going to stay home and gain weight.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, I'm just kidding. Of course I'm kidding.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Guys, Loki's going to be joining us over Skype for the next few weeks.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And, Loki, do you want to elaborate on our special little arrangement?

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, yeah. It's basically my wife.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We're getting very close to the end of her pregnancy.

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And so because third pregnancies can happen a lot quicker than the previous ones, I have to be ready to go.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So it's easier if I'm at home versus 15 minutes away to be able to get to wherever I need to go.

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I mean, not that I will probably have to do that, but you just have to be prepared.

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Right, yeah. You never know. I mean, when the baby's coming, the baby's coming.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You may have to leave mid-show and then we'll just deal with it. It is what it is.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You might end up having to deliver.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, I was joking with you before we went live tonight. I was kind of hoping a little bit that,

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
oh, maybe you would get a Christmas baby or a New Year's baby or have that baby in the newspaper.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
First baby born in 2014 and that whole type of thing. And you were like, no.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's probably not going to happen. She's due at the end of January, but he's measuring two weeks ahead.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And I think Josh was born at 37 weeks. So it's probably going to be the first or second week in January.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think she's saying maybe two more weeks and he'll be born.

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, you're being an awful, as they say in chat room. Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And you can join us and chat if you are listening live at live.vognetwork.com.

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Travis Donovan, our buddy from Under Sedation Live, kicking off Loki Baby Watch 2013, dun-dun-dun.

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Although act-def corrects him and says it could be 2014. So 2013 to 2014.

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And we already have the name picked out, although I can't say what it is yet.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But the middle name does kind of tie into a video game.

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
A video game I don't play, but it's still a video game.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Interesting.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
She asked me, she's all, so how should we spell that? And so I spelled it out very specifically to be like the video game.

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So StriderHearYou is the middle name.

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room, I love this. Alan Alchemy says Nellie Control, that's the wife of course, Nellie Control, Loki now.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The baby is here. LOLJK, I needed you to get off Skype. I can't handle your Nintendo rants when they're happening where I can hear them.

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now go get me Chipotle.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Odds of that happening?

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Pretty slim.

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She's out of the house until 8 o'clock. That's usually, she goes to her mom's house and takes Josh with her.

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have at least a couple hours with them gone.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There you go. So the thing is though, of course, I think part of the charm of Orange Lounge Radio and the way we've done things for the past,

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you know, what year are we on now? 12? Is next year year 12? I lost count. I've literally lost count.

125
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
June it will be 12.

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, next year. 2014 is year 12. So we've been on the air about 12 years and I think part of the charm of the show and part of what makes our show a little different is the fact that we're all in the same room, usually.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And, you know, I realize there's 11 billion other podcasts that tape over Skype and do a great job over Skype.

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Shit, my other show, Hoard House, done over Skype and we have a great time over there.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But, you know, when it comes down to, alright, well, are we going to force everybody to be in the same room and make Loki take a month off from the show?

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Or are we going to have him on Skype? I choose having him on Skype.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So we'll deal with the Skype thing and have a little bit of a different chemistry over the next few weeks while we wait for Loki baby number 2 to be on the way.

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I had kitty cam going but we had to shut off because of bandwidth reasons. She's sleeping anyway, so.

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, there was kitty cam earlier. We might do some type of cam in the coming weeks.

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm hoping there's going to be a new cable modem in studio in the coming weeks and then we can look at maybe pumping out a little more with the bandwidth.

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But since we had some drops from live listeners in the past couple weeks, I gotta watch what's going in and out, so.

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Alright, but yeah, so Loki will be joining us over Skype but it'll still be the same old same old, him doing his stories and talking about his gaming week in a moment.

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But first, I have to introduce here in studio, he hasn't gone anywhere, well he wasn't here last week, but he's been spending the majority of the holidays here with us at Orange Songs Radio.

138
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Say hello to the voice of the show, Mr. Jason. VX Jason XV XYZ Element OP.

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I made it.

140
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You made it.

141
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I finally made it back.

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
How you doing?

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I am doing so much better than this time last week.

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well you had that same plague that knocked a lot of us out.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, it was the Saturday prior to the show, no, that's impossible, I would have missed Sunday.

146
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Saturday was the worst of the two.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Sunday I actually felt okay, but considering that we're jam-packed around this table when all four of us are here, I said, you know, whatever.

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm ancillary and as much as I want to contribute, I'll pass because my voice was notably worse as well.

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm surprised.

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can kindly hear it in last week's intro.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Now that I've told you that, go back and listen to last week's intro and you'll hear it. You probably didn't notice.

152
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I pushed really hard to make sure it was clean the whole time, but the whole rest of the day, just my voice disappeared and that was that.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You know, I was sick on last week's show. I'm pretty sure I voiced that openly during the show last week.

154
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And what the weird thing is though, I was really sick like Friday, Saturday, and then I was feeling a lot better Sunday and I'm like, finally, I'm on the other side of this.

155
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But come Monday, oh my God, snacks.

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's almost like I had two colds or something because then Monday, Tuesday, I felt like crap and I feel great again.

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I actually wound up, it's funny because I actually wanted to watch the show, but many of the live chatters may have noticed that I also didn't participate.

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And that would be because I wound up being on the phone for 10 hours with a customer.

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I was on the phone from six in the evening until four in the morning or something like that.

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It was kind of a crazy night.

161
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But it wasn't like your angry customer.

162
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No, not even a little bit.

163
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And as I got off the phone, he was also lauding my efforts, which, you know, when you're on that almost euphoric high of, this issue's finally over.

164
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And the fact that any customer can thank you profusely, it's a wonderful feeling.

165
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So, you know, I mentioned this on a previous episode of the show, but you've been hard at work on our latest endeavor into putting the shows on YouTube.

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have been trying to expand our audience a little more. And once again, thank you for that.

167
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And you've been doing, I noticed you've been doing a little more and I realize there's a lot going on with YouTube, especially with gaming.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And we'll get into that a little later in the news. And I'm sure y'all know what I'm talking about.

169
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But for the time being, we're just, you know, we're still putting our videos on YouTube, just like, you know, we have been.

170
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And you've been, I notice every week you turn it up a little bit. You have something new to put in there every week.

171
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I decided to take this on because I wanted more than just a static image. And I also really have been wanting to pick up these skills.

172
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So what better way than putting these two together? I haven't gotten terribly crazy.

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Last week's 531's edits were, I did a silly little thing with the cover art for the intro.

174
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The gaming week has been there for the last two or three episodes. The classic game of the week, rather.

175
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The video that we played in studio has been on stream for the past three episodes, I think.

176
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The two newer things that I did this time are that when we were having, when you three were having this discussion about me last week,

177
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I put a little heart, put a little heart in the empty space in the top right hand side.

178
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Little easter eggs. Just fun, tiny little thing. Left it up there for about ten seconds.

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But what I'm also doing is I'm also putting the fortune cookie, a little clip of the fortune cookie of the week as the end of the video.

180
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
While the outro is playing, I put a clip of the fortune cookie message of the day there so that we can start linking and have that reference for visitors as well.

181
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Let me explain what that is real quick because we have to remember there's a large base there.

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The podcast listeners are like, what's a fortune cookie? Remember, we have a huge audience that isn't here live.

183
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I mention it sometimes.

184
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, not huge. Let's not kid ourselves.

185
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We have one sizable person who tells us the podcast.

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
There's a good chunk of listeners who are just on the podcast.

187
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And so what happens is that because we're part of a live radio network, VOG network, we're still kind of on air, so to speak, even when the show is done.

188
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So usually we sign out a little bit with, okay, so we're going to pull the plug now and go back to the music feed.

189
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But here's our last little goodbye.

190
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And so our fortune cookie message is always kind of like our sign off message at the end of the night.

191
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And Jamie, for years and years, because we've been doing this for years.

192
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I used to actually make up a fortune cookie message.

193
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's right. You used to, yeah, I think back in the days of OLR, you used to have like a little saying.

194
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And then it became a little more like, I guess, what you see on the Daily Show and the moment is end and all that.

195
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And when we were on all games and now that we're here on VOG, you just kind of would sign off with that.

196
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So, yeah, I think my first one was love is like wearing your pants on your face.

197
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It can make you a butthead.

198
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Still so relevant to the day.

199
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I know, right? Some things, some advice never changes.

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So you know what the best literal fortune I've ever seen was, was when Melody had great things will happen when you.

201
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, yeah, she got that cookie once it was like not finished.

202
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Dan's got the best one, too.

203
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Every man has his enemies.

204
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I got an X rated one once because there used to be this restaurant up in Chico because I went to school for three years up in Chico, California, which was an interesting time in my life to say the place, say the least.

205
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But they have they have the best Mongolian barbecue place up there, the best I've ever had to this day.

206
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And I hope they're still good, but I will I'll give a shout out because at least 10 years ago Hula's was the bomb up in Chico.

207
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know if we have any listeners up there in Chico, but if you do, if we if we do shout out and that place is the bomb and they used to.

208
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
They don't anymore. But 10 years ago, you asked for the special fortunes or the pink fortunes and they would bring you the X rated cookies.

209
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And they would be things that say like, you know, double your pleasure, double your fun, fuck twins.

210
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Or once I got one that says, doesn't this cookie look like a cunt?

211
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You know, like, sorry, explicit tag.

212
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But this one time we were with a big group of people, like 12 people, we were all eating the fortunes.

213
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We had the special ones. Everybody's giggling. And they were like, what'd you get? What'd you get?

214
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And then when they came to me, they're like, Rob, what's your fortune say? What's your fortune say?

215
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And I'm like, I can't tell you because you know what? You have to eat the cookie or the fortune doesn't come true.

216
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So I, you know, taking my sweet ass time eating the cookie, enjoying every bite, really exaggerating it.

217
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Finally, I get to opening my fortune and reading it out loud. The fortune said, go fuck yourself.

218
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And everybody at the table is like scream laughing because all that effort, I know all that.

219
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And of course, if I don't, you know, eat the cookie first, it won't come true.

220
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So that was, that was the best fortune I ever got was the one that was a cookie.

221
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You told me to go fuck myself. All right. Anyhow.

222
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Travis says, Rob, prove you on the right to use the C word.

223
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How am I supposed to prove that?

224
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You know, you know who, by the way?

225
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If you're offended by my use of that, sorry, but a cookie said it first.

226
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh, I'm not supposed to say cookie. I'm sorry.

227
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No one ever, no one has ever said that word as great as Bette Midler.

228
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
They called me all kinds of horrible things. It started with a C and ended with content.

229
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Me no like cookie.

230
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So anyway, now that we've earned our explicit tag.

231
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes.

232
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
While I'm at it, vagina balls anus.

233
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Okay. Wow. All right. It is a show about-

234
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Happy holidays.

235
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Believe it or not, it's a show about video games. So we are going to talk about video games.

236
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I actually don't really have much of a kickoff topic tonight, which is probably for the best.

237
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I have one.

238
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What?

239
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I hate you.

240
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why do you hate me?

241
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You're telling me about Frivolo.

242
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh, the wine?

243
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You and you and Victoria.

244
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
God damn it. I drank a whole bottle of that shit.

245
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And then I went and bought two more today.

246
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So Victoria's wine addiction, Jamie's wine addiction is the kickoff topic for tonight.

247
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There you go. She's got a problem.

248
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
No, I was-

249
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes, this is an intervention.

250
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
No, you can't have my Frivolo.

251
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Your Frivolo is affecting your life negatively in the following ways.

252
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I was just going to ask kind of just generally, like, what are your guys' plans for the holiday week?

253
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And, you know, are you going to be able to get a lot of gaming in or what?

254
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I know I'll probably be playing a lot of games throughout this week because I don't do a whole, whole lot for the holidays.

255
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And, you know, I have a huge-

256
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But would you say you don't have a whole, whole, whole lot?

257
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Get the fuck out of my house.

258
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Cool. He left his computer.

259
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Bye. Yeah. Scram. That's what I thought.

260
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
All right. Anyway.

261
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Jamie, do you have anything going on this week? Games you're going to be catching up on or anything?

262
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Well, I've been playing some Skullgirls, so I might play a little bit more of that.

263
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But Dan and I both took advantage of Steam Sales and got the Angry Video Game Nerd game.

264
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay.

265
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So that's on probably my list of new stuff to play.

266
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I got to vote for the next game so I can get my card.

267
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I voted already. I got my snow globe. You can't have it.

268
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I definitely have the Stanley parable I need to catch up on. I bought that in the last sale.

269
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That game is the fucking shit.

270
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah. No, I know. I've heard a lot-

271
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I love the Stanley parable.

272
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

273
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Jason, anything you're going to plan on catching up on during the week? When do you go back to Colorado?

274
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I- February.

275
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, shit.

276
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We're going to have you-

277
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That game's completely serious.

278
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
We're going to have you well past the holidays, aren't we?

279
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah.

280
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Alrighty.

281
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We'll be here to shoe in the new year.

282
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Nice.

283
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And then some.

284
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Mm-hmm.

285
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Any gaming that you plan to catch up on?

286
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh.

287
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Not really.

288
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Not really?

289
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There's no TV in the apartment.

290
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We have a set up at the office and I could do that, but nothing- there will be games, but no specific plans.

291
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Okay.

292
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Loki, what about you? I know you're waiting for the baby, but-

293
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Um. I don't know. Maybe more Grand Theft Auto. I was supposed to play this weekend because they had like some multiplayer event, but didn't do anything there.

294
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And I've been playing buy things on Steam sale the game, so yeah, there's that.

295
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Alrighty. So it sounds like everybody's just building up their backlog further of games to tackle in the new year.

296
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Every sale. Every sale.

297
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I came so close to getting a PlayStation 4 this week, you guys. And then finally I was just like, alright, but really, what are you gonna play on it?

298
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So I have to wait until there's a couple more games on it and then I'll buy it. But I was thinking I'd have that to play over the holidays, but looks like that didn't end up happening.

299
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
For the record, the community choice game is The Walking Dead.

300
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes. Good pick.

301
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's the last one that won.

302
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I voted for Duke Nukem for the next sale because I won-

303
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Me too. Ditto.

304
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I won it when it's too cheap.

305
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Got it.

306
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I know. I want it to be- Well, vote for it for me.

307
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I own it too, but I still voted for it because hell yes.

308
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I want that multiplayer.

309
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
They have a multiplayer beta right now on it.

310
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Ooh, the multiplayer's in beta?

311
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah, multiplayer's in beta, so you can actually play multiplayer if you want.

312
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Nice. Excited about that.

313
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
SSG100Matt in chat says, I actually bought La Lulana today. I missed that. I didn't see that.

314
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, I bought that today too.

315
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That's a buck.

316
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Damn it.

317
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It was like a buck. Two bucks.

318
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I missed it.

319
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I think I bought it for a Thanksgiving sale.

320
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It'll probably show up on a daily sale.

321
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, easily. Of course. Absolutely.

322
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Put it in your wish list so you get notified next time.

323
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I get a lot of meal about that.

324
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Anyway, all right. Let's get into- I mean, we're kind of already talking about it a little bit.

325
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and specifically what video games have you been playing this week?

326
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What have you been into? What's been going on in your gaming world?

327
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Dark Sakura.

328
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Well, let's see. I bought La Lulana today. I've been playing- I actually got back into Final Fantasy XIV,

329
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
but I completely forgot what the fuck I was doing.

330
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
However, I did find I had another story quest to do, so that means I'll have to do my job quest for another few levels.

331
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
With that new patch now, it's like everything's changed.

332
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Because now you can do a daily dungeon to get XP, you can do guild tests to get XP,

333
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you can do the guild levs now give a reasonable amount of XP, but you can do those as regular quests.

334
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The patch really changed a lot, and almost all of it's for the better.

335
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Well, I've played for a little bit, but for some reason I was getting kind of stupidly motion sick.

336
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And I really am trying not to play too much more until my computer upgrade's finished.

337
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Because Dan decided to bust out our friend, the credit card, and buy new cases, new CPUs, new processors,

338
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
new motherboards, USB adapters, and he's buying me a new sound card as well,

339
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
so that the rest of our computers catch up to our bitchin' graphics cards.

340
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Seriously, it's like you have a graphics card that can handle a horde of 20,000, and a processor that can handle 10.

341
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So, yeah. Tired of my games choking up, so we've been sort of taking it, uh, you know.

342
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I've copied over so many things, and I know Steam Cloud will back up my saves, but I still want to, you know,

343
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
like I've got all my Mass Effect stuff. I'm going to have to manually re-patch my Mass Effect 3 for the high res stuff,

344
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
because I don't want to have to go through the, I mean, I've got all the textures and everything saved,

345
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and good thing I know how to do that. But, like, if I'm going through all of this effort to upgrade my computer,

346
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I want everything that I play to still look awesome. So, um, that's really had me sort of slow down on some of my gaming.

347
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm really jealous that you got a computer upgrade, though, because that's something I want, too.

348
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, but my computer's like four or five years old.

349
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah. Well, mine's getting there, too. I bought mine when I was with my ex, so that was like five years ago.

350
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Good fries. Dan founds, just talk to us later.

351
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Well, Alan did a really cool thing where online, he used some website, and maybe he can say it in chat,

352
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
but it's like a build your own PC site where you put in the components you want, and it shows you what stores have it for the cheapest price,

353
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
like how much your computer would cost overall. I think it's like build a PC or build a PC or something,

354
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
he'll say it in chat here in a minute, but he has like a computer for me saved on that site.

355
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Well, I'll tell you what we often do like at Fry's, and I know Fry's isn't everywhere,

356
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
but we have a little app called Shop Savvy that is for iPhone, Android, everything,

357
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
where you scan the barcode on whatever component it is that you want, and since Fry's has to price match,

358
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
that's their policy, you can use the Shop Savvy app and have them check it,

359
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and so they'll still give you whatever the lowest price you find on it is, so you don't have to really go much of anywhere else.

360
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Wow, nice.

361
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, it's Shop Savvy, everybody use it. I bought my copy of Battle Royale, instead of paying 20 bucks at Best Buy,

362
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I paid 10 bucks. I bought my Mass Effect 3 for 30 bucks when it was still going for 50 something on the PC, so I'm just saying.

363
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
PCPartPicker.com.

364
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That is the website, thank you. Mako said it and then Alan confirmed it there. PCPartPicker, that is the site.

365
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But other than that, I've been playing Animal Crossing and playing Zelda.

366
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Awesome.

367
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I can't get past the stupid fucking worm shit in the second fucking level, god damn it.

368
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You'll get there.

369
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Well, it's like, and the same thing happened in The Link to the Past to me, when I was 14, 15 something,

370
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and so it took me two hours to beat it on that one, and I don't want it to take me that long because,

371
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
damn it, it's the 2010 era, and I have no patience. I want my gratification, give it to me.

372
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So, I turned off the game and drank half a bottle of wine.

373
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Works for me. Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

374
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Did Loki walk away? Loki? Loki, are you on mute?

375
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Have that, just a sec.

376
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Babies coming, everybody, show's over.

377
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The wonders of doing a show on Skype. Alright, Jason, why don't I just go to you while we wait for Loki?

378
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I just bought the You Don't Know Jack classic pack for $5.

379
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Did you really?

380
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Did you act deaf? I seriously did.

381
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And I can play none of them until I figure out how to work out a Windows box for my deluge of games that I cannot play natively.

382
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Speaking of Windows and not being able to play natively, not exactly gaming, but I got a new-to-me laptop this week that is a Retina MacBook Pro.

383
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's kind of amazing. It's very funny when websites and programs, graphics are,

384
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
you can really start to tell when they cheaped out on saving the graphics because you look at the text, it's beautiful.

385
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You look at everything else, it's terrible and smudgy. It's really hilarious.

386
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I am enjoying this laptop so far. And it's so much lighter. Oh my god, I can't even put into words even though I just did.

387
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I played a bit more Papers, Please this week.

388
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I've heard a lot of great things about that game.

389
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It is insanely fun.

390
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's like on my list.

391
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:06,000
For something, it's so frustrating and you definitely get the demerit, the violation kind of being on edge if you got a violation or not.

392
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
But it's for whatever reason really really fun and I just cleared it for the first time.

393
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I have a screenshot up on Steam. I need to go back and start doing it via other methods.

394
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I won't say which ending I got or which other ones because they are all incredibly meaningful so I'm just going to skip that outright.

395
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
If you're my friend on Steam, go look it up. You'll figure it out.

396
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I... Code Man sent me Surgeon Simulator as a gift and that game is... I've been wanting to play it since I've seen videos.

397
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I am hilariously bad at it and I think everybody is.

398
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I think everybody is pretty much.

399
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's so much fun.

400
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And I picked up Electronic Super Joy for $1.50. Still need to play it.

401
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So anyways, the real meaning for one is this week I bought an Xbox One and PS4 controller.

402
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I have not... I have not bought the systems. They are here in my hands right now.

403
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
They are here in studio. He brought them in here and he said, look what I bought.

404
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And he handed me the PlayStation 4 controller.

405
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Where's the consoles?

406
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And I was like, you bought...

407
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I just bought controllers.

408
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm like, you bought both consoles? He's like, no, just the controllers.

409
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm like, you're so weird, Jason.

410
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I... For some reason I thought that I heard both controllers work natively with computers.

411
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That's not the case.

412
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
As I also recently learned, and I posted this picture to Twitter, the Xbox One controller uses Wi-Fi.

413
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And for that reason alone, computers, like game controllers via Wi-Fi on a computer are not a thing by default.

414
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That said, the PS4 controller works over USB and Bluetooth.

415
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
When I first got it, I tried using Steam's big picture and playing games.

416
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It was being fussy. It wasn't working.

417
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Rogue Legacy control scheme was really, really fucked up.

418
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I wanted to have a second swing of it last night when preparing a little bit for the show.

419
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And I managed to bind everything in Steam big picture mode, which then affected Rogue Legacy.

420
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Nice.

421
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And so I was playing Rogue Legacy for like two hours last night with a controller and it worked incredibly well.

422
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Big picture mode is good times.

423
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I think when I finally do get a new computer, I'll use the old one on the TV.

424
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It'll be fun.

425
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It works exceedingly well in lieu of the Steam machine controller.

426
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Uh, BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying to you, Jason, they said they would work eventually.

427
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah, they'll be, well, on Windows eventually.

428
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And then somebody will do a third-party one for the Mac.

429
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah, it'll happen next year. A bit disappointing that I can't use it already.

430
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's interesting. The Xbox One controller has the right heft.

431
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And the PS4's triggers, L2 and R2, don't feel quite right.

432
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
But when I actually, and that was my initial reaction.

433
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
When I actually sat down and played the game, it didn't make a difference.

434
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
They both worked, tactile, responsive, felt right.

435
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The Xbox One's D-pad is so much better.

436
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Even better than the Xbox 360 pro controller.

437
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yes, yes, a hundred times yes.

438
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The Xbox One controller is so clicky in like the best way though.

439
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Maybe I just have fat thumbs.

440
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But when I do like, let's say I'm doing a Hoduken move on the little control pad there.

441
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
My thumb like bumps the other thumb stick.

442
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's the only little problem I have.

443
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Interesting.

444
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Maybe I just have big thumbs.

445
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You know what they say about guys with big thumbs.

446
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah, big gloves.

447
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Thank you for beating me to it.

448
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I saw, so yeah, the PS4 controller is working well.

449
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I really do look forward to trying out the Xbox One controller.

450
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'd like to put both of them to use.

451
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Funny story, I actually did this exact same thing with the original Xbox.

452
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I didn't like the S controllers.

453
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And so I went out and bought the original full size fatty Xbox controller for myself.

454
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Those wired 360 controllers though made bomb, and still do, like PC controllers.

455
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That's exactly why I bought these.

456
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That's what I'm using.

457
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They are the best game pad you can get.

458
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Me too.

459
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm very happy with this PS4 controller so far.

460
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Much more than my Logitech something something something.

461
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm going to the chat room live.vognetware.com.

462
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Tigerclaw with another theory.

463
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Jason basically bought those controllers so he can get a handle on how they feel and practice using them when he gets either of the consoles.

464
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's okay, I'm still going to suck at all the games.

465
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Especially if I play it against other people that actually own it.

466
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But I appreciate console game pads and I'm happy with them.

467
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Alright, so.

468
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I like that you can push the little touchpad.

469
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, I don't know how many people know this, but the touchpad is actually a button.

470
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The touchpad doesn't work on a computer, but the fact that it is a button and can be depressed does actually work.

471
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It may work on a computer someday.

472
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah, eventually. Out of the box.

473
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Saw a new game that will be out next year that is in the show roll so I'll leave it for later.

474
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I would have screamed loudly in enthusiasm had there not been another housemate in the apartment that I'm staying in.

475
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And also in an apartment.

476
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You would have shrieked.

477
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I would have. I would have nerd shrieked, nerdgazamed, and nerd other expletives that I will leave for your imagination.

478
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Alright. On that note, I think Loki's back. Hi, Loki.

479
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Sorry about that. Yeah, my mom called me.

480
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
That's alright. She never calls you when you're here.

481
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
No, she doesn't. She can't find my sister, but not my problem right now.

482
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Alright. Well, I hope they find her. Did they check behind the couch?

483
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Maybe.

484
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Alright, how was your gaming week, Loki?

485
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I played a little bit of Just Cause multiplayer.

486
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Actually, now that it's launched officially, I checked out some of the servers on there.

487
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I picked just a random one and playing it a little bit.

488
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So it's pretty fun. They had all their weapons and purchasables free.

489
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So that was kind of neat.

490
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And then I played a little bit of Saints Row IV.

491
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I mentioned before that I had bought the season pass for DLC when it was on sale.

492
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And so I got a chance to finally play through Enter the Dominatrix, which was, as expected, incredibly short.

493
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And unfortunately, the whole joke that they were trying to go with it, the whole mockumentary thing, just wasn't very funny.

494
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And thank god they didn't ever release Enter the Dominatrix as a full game because it would have been fucking terrible.

495
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And in fact, the whole thing, there was only one time that I laughed in it, which was at the very end of the game where you friend these raptors.

496
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And so you're riding the raptors out of the simulation while they're singing this song of their people, which is Walk the Dinosaur.

497
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So that was kind of funny, but the rest of it just wasn't funny at all.

498
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
That's unfortunate to hear it's not that funny, because I associate Saints Row with one of the funniest games I've played.

499
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
They tried to do some stuff that's supposed to be funny.

500
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Some of the cutscenes were animatics and literally some dude holding an action figure and doing something.

501
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't know, I guess that was supposed to be funny, but it just wasn't funny.

502
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's like they were trying too hard.

503
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Fair enough.

504
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And then... I bought lots of things.

505
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I really wasn't going to spend a ton of money on the seam sale, but...

506
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That's what they all say, Loki. That's what they all say.

507
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So let's see what I picked up here.

508
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The orange box, because surprisingly enough I didn't have that.

509
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Noidulove 2 Devolution, which is kind of like a sprite-based shooter.

510
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Retrograde, which is kind of a space shooter slash rhythm game.

511
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The whole game plays backwards, so you basically have to move where bullets came from, and it goes with the music.

512
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Then there's Ballpoint Universe Infinite, which is a hand-drawn game.

513
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And Blockland, which is very much like Minecraft, but it actually looks like Legos.

514
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So that's kind of neat, and they have a whole deathmatch thing with that as well.

515
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Final Fantasy VII, and then of course Cody got me the Stanley Parable, so that was pretty sweet.

516
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And then today I had to pick up La Mulana because it's down to like a buck or something.

517
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Can't believe I missed it. So upset.

518
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You can always catch the Yesterday sales, though. They repost them.

519
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Wasn't that a Flash sale?

520
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I don't know.

521
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It was a Flash sale, yeah.

522
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It'll come up again. I'm not worried about it.

523
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So yeah, pretty much that.

524
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And then I don't think I actually played any Grand Theft Auto Online.

525
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
They've been doing some mass bandings. Thankfully I didn't get caught up in that.

526
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So that's it. Just trying to get through the DLC stuff for Saints Row IV since my save got pretty much eradicated.

527
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And so I've been kind of running through that real fast.

528
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And I still haven't unlocked the Christmas DLC because that's later on in the game.

529
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So once I get to that, I'll talk about that.

530
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
At least hopefully that has the potential to be a little bit funnier than this last one.

531
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Alrighty.

532
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Getting into my gaming week.

533
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Talking about some games I've played before and I've talked about before.

534
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
More Final Fantasy XIV.

535
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Loving the new patch.

536
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Being able to level up an alternate job class much better than just fate partying to death.

537
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So that's amazing. I love it.

538
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And thank you to Generous Listeners.

539
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
By the way, I know some folks have mentioned Codeman got them games.

540
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Codeman got me a game too.

541
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
X-Link was kind enough to get me a game too.

542
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So I just want to thank the listeners.

543
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You guys really don't have to. Thank you so much.

544
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Speaking of Generous Listener, did you see in chat what Dark Tetsuya said?

545
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Dark Tetsuya says, Rob, if you want it, you can have my Steam key.

546
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Oh my god, what a nice... Yes, yes, I want it.

547
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Thank you. That's amazing. Thank you so much.

548
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I can pay you in doggy coins.

549
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Or is it Doge? I don't know. How do you say the D-O-G-E?

550
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Dog.

551
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Is it just dog coins?

552
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Dog.

553
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I say doggy.

554
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's dog.

555
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Okay, I have not gotten into... Okay, Tangent Train, choo choo choo.

556
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I have not really gotten into any of this virtual currency crap.

557
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Like I've heard of Bitcoin and I know people are into it.

558
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But then like, okay, so you know Matt that was on the show a couple weeks ago?

559
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Like we're friends, he's on Facebook and he made all these posts about doggy coin.

560
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And you know that meme, it is a really funny meme.

561
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You know the, wow, such impress, many excite, wow.

562
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You know that whole thing.

563
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And so I just started going link, link, link and I read all this stuff on it.

564
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And suddenly I'm like mining coins and getting all this stuff.

565
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So I have doggy coins.

566
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So I can pay you...

567
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I call it doge.

568
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I can pay you for La Milana and doggy coins if you want Dark Tetsuya.

569
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Just get a wallet for it.

570
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So anyway, sorry, that was like a totally random tangent.

571
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But that was taking up like, that was insomnia night.

572
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Much insomnia.

573
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Such clicking links.

574
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Wow.

575
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I call it doge.

576
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Doge?

577
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah.

578
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I think doggy.

579
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Is there a correct way to pronounce it?

580
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That's what I want to know.

581
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
My understanding of it is that it's born out of Homestar Runner.

582
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And I don't know why letters were, why like the word, the spelling D-O-G-E was introduced.

583
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But Homestar Runner was making fun of, was making fun of people calling each other dog.

584
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So he kind of drawed out dog and spelled it D-O-G-E, presumably like a animation caption.

585
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I need to go see the episode.

586
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But...

587
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Sorry, I just...

588
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Just to read the things going through from several people.

589
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah.

590
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Doge Lounge Radio, such audio, many commentary, very podcast.

591
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You have to, such audio, many commentary, very podcast.

592
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
There were, Buzzfeed put a bunch of those up, by the way, about different political things.

593
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Well, Buzzfeed likes to jack everything.

594
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah, but I thought, I left my ass off.

595
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Have you seen, there's a great Tumblr.

596
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's Buzzfeed without GIFs.

597
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So it's just, it's just the writing.

598
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So you can see how fucking awful it is.

599
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Anyway, anyway, sorry.

600
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Total train to rail met.

601
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Let's go back to my games.

602
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
What?

603
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Choo choo.

604
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Thank you to the generous listeners that somehow that turned into doggy coin.

605
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So thank you to the generous listeners.

606
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Stuff I've been playing in the meantime though.

607
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Still Zelda.

608
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I got into Minecraft again randomly this week on Xbox and it was...

609
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Very pixel.

610
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It was...

611
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Much pic.

612
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Creepy crawlers.

613
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Wow.

614
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So like Black Wolf made a one-off comment on it while we were playing Final Fantasy 14

615
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
because he won't admit it y'all, but Bobby Black Wolf got addicted to Final Fantasy 14

616
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
in the past week and has had my help in clearing some of the early game stuff.

617
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But he brought up Minecraft randomly and I was like, I'm going to go play Minecraft on

618
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
360, which had been the first time I touched it in a long time.

619
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And then that exact same day they released Minecraft for the PlayStation 3.

620
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And so I was like, I kind of want to get it, but like, Rob, you couldn't even finish your

621
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
house in Minecraft PC.

622
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Why would you get Minecraft PlayStation 3?

623
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I don't know.

624
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I just, I have to have it.

625
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Loki, did you see, did you see Minecraft on PS3?

626
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I didn't really, because I was going to buy it, but then they basically said it's exactly

627
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
the same as the Xbox 360 one.

628
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So I was like, eh, I don't really need it.

629
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Interesting.

630
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't know.

631
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I might.

632
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Like if it was, you know, like the maps were bigger or there's more features or something

633
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
maybe, but I guess that's all for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one.

634
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But trophies, Loki trophies.

635
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I wonder if it'll have cross-buy or if you buy it on PlayStation 3, you get it on PlayStation

636
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
4.

637
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But the trophies are exactly the same as the last one.

638
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I mean, I don't know.

639
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Cross-buy would be really interesting because wouldn't that make like the first portable

640
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
version of Minecraft?

641
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Other than Minecraft portable?

642
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
iPhone, iPhone, iPod.

643
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh, I forgot that existed.

644
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Okay.

645
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Nevermind.

646
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Well, it would be the first, the first tactile and like for, for as many buttons as that,

647
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
as that game has the potential of using and whatnot, that would make a Vita would be a

648
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
good potential.

649
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You know, it would be a lot of fun on the Vita.

650
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So I'm looking, I mean, I know that's something they're making, not even just real play.

651
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Technically it's supposed to have controller support.

652
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I mean, the portable version, I mean, they had a version with controller support for

653
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
the, uh, was it Sony Ericsson Play?

654
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Cause, cause everybody's going to be playing it on that.

655
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
All right.

656
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Anyway, let me get to the game.

657
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I really wanted to talk about it cause that was all a bunch of old stuff.

658
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Let me talk about the new game this week.

659
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And a lot of people talking about this game and I've been playing an awful lot of this

660
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
game as well.

661
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Um, so we're going to talk about Nintendo direct in a little bit and some of the stuff

662
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
that they announced this week.

663
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Cause Nintendo kind of was the big newsmaker this week because they actually did a direct

664
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
with some new news.

665
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And one of the games that they, they teased during this Nintendo direct was yes.

666
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,000
New news, uh, was this surprise NES remix, a brand new game that they put out on the

667
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
um, eShop for $15.

668
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And of course the minute I saw the trailer, I was like, such retro games, many pixels.

669
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Wow.

670
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And I bought it.

671
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Right.

672
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So I had to just go immediately to the store and buy it.

673
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Um, because you know, it tickled my retro bond and I love, that sounds kind of dirty

674
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
actually, but I, you know, I just love those retro games and collections.

675
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So I went immediately to the shop and bought it.

676
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Did you have a retro boner?

677
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I might have a little bit actually.

678
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So, you know, and it was, it was, it was a very Beyonce thing cause they get, it said

679
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
it's on the eShop right now, which was really spectacular when you consider that they went

680
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
to the VGX thing the week before and decided to talk about it.

681
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Said nothing about it.

682
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Said nothing about it.

683
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It was like, we got cranky Kong and that's all I'm going to tell you, Jeff Keeley.

684
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And they do, they do a Nintendo direct days later with like actual news.

685
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Fantastic.

686
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Didn't we say that was exactly what was going to happen though?

687
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That they were going to give, give another outlet nothing and still rely on their own

688
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
outlets for doing this?

689
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Um, I don't know if we really had said that, but I was kind of surprised that like, I mean

690
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
one week, Jason, it was one week later, they knew all this other stuff and they purposely

691
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
held onto it for their own direct for whatever reason.

692
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
They have a captive audience and they're going to keep, they're, they're going to make that

693
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
their point.

694
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah.

695
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So, okay.

696
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I want to talk about NES remix though, because I bought the game and I'm sure a lot of you

697
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
guys have seen this.

698
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Many people have been comparing it to WarioWare, which it's kind of an iffy comparison to me

699
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
because WarioWare is very fast paced and the eight bit levels and things in that were very,

700
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
uh, you know, it was like push button dodge, you know, it was like one quick little thing

701
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
because that's how WarioWare was.

702
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Whereas NES remix is more little bite sized samples.

703
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It's like, it's like the Halloween bag full of the mini Snickers bars and full of the mini.

704
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's fun sized.

705
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yes.

706
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It's like one of those fun sized Halloween bags.

707
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
They're not micro games, but they're just enough of a taste of some of the retro games.

708
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Right?

709
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Although I have never put one of those things in my mouth and said, wow, I'm having fun.

710
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
But here's the problem with NES remix that I have is that because it's a bag of all the little

711
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
mini candies, unfortunately some of the games they included are like the Hershey's dark

712
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
chocolates where it's like, I don't want that shit.

713
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Hey, those are the best.

714
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Well, they're all yours.

715
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
If you, if you enjoy golf wrecking crew, urban champion, those little candy bars are all

716
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
you girl.

717
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Enjoy.

718
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But I'm going to guess there's probably not a lot of fans out there of some of the games

719
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
that they included in the collection, which all right.

720
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
All right.

721
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
All right.

722
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
That's the one thing that kind of, you know, cause you start with, I think six games and

723
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
then you unlock others and some of them you go, Oh yay.

724
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I got Legend of Zelda.

725
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yay.

726
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yay.

727
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's a great one.

728
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And then it's like, Oh, I got golf.

729
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Well, I won't be playing that one.

730
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I mean, really who likes NES golf anymore?

731
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You know, it's a, there's a million better golf simulations out there now.

732
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Maybe at the time it was a fun game for, you know, golf fans, but now it's, it's, it's

733
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
like a, it's painful to go back and play, I think is, is part of the issue.

734
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So, um, and, uh, you're playing little portions of these games.

735
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So maybe it's like, get from point A to B and it's like, Loki.

736
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
All right over there.

737
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Easy.

738
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
All right.

739
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't know.

740
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Maybe, maybe they, I'm hoping they found a sister or whatever that was.

741
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
All right.

742
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Anyway, so that was the GPS bell.

743
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Oh, we found her.

744
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Many rings, such distracting.

745
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Um, so you, you, what was the one I was playing right before the show started?

746
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It was three super Mario brothers levels and it was break or break the block that has the vine in it.

747
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And it was the levels really quick, but find the hidden vine block.

748
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But some of them, you know, some of them are hidden over piranha plants and things where you might die.

749
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So I, you know, it has a little bit of challenge.

750
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So the little bite-sized games, it actually works because I think the way a lot of us approach retro games is that we don't necessarily want to play these retro games start to finish.

751
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Especially, it's the way many people feel about like Ice Climber or Clu Clu Land.

752
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
They don't really need to play those games start to finish.

753
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
In the case of Ice Climber, you just need to play like 15 seconds of the game to remember like, oh yeah, I remember Ice Climber.

754
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Fuck, I hate the physics in this game.

755
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Right?

756
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That's kind of enough to remind you of the game and that's good enough.

757
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So there's that to get out of it.

758
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The remix stages, some of them are actually really cool.

759
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Like there's one where you play Super Luigi Brothers or whatever where you run World 1-2 and it's backwards.

760
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And some stages where the camera will consistently zoom in on your character or zoom out Mario Brothers, like original Mario Brothers levels that scroll.

761
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Even though the original Mario Brothers, not Super Mario Brothers, but the original Mario Brothers was a static screen.

762
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So they do some neat things.

763
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And in playing those levels, I really realized like, wow, Virtual Console really pisses me off.

764
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Because you see them doing all these neat little things with the retro games.

765
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Like even in like some of the Mario Brothers stages or Super Mario Brothers stages, they add like little sunset backgrounds and some neat little things.

766
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It kind of really makes you go like...

767
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Very anger, much rage?

768
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yes! Why won't they take this effort with Virtual Console?

769
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It's basically the same kind of changes from Mario 1, 2, and 3 NES to Super Mario All-Stars 1, 2, and 3.

770
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm going to be honest...

771
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
More functional maybe, but similar.

772
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The more I played NES Remix, the more frustrated I got with just everything.

773
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And I know that's going to sound like the weirdest review in the world, but I'm just being honest you guys.

774
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
As a gamer fan, as a retro game fan, the longer I played NES Remix, the more angry I got at Nintendo.

775
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And part of it was that all the games that are included in NES Remix are just games that are available on the eShop.

776
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So the whole thing is just, you know, in some ways ads for the games that are on Virtual Console.

777
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Yeah! Did you like the part where you can actually link to the part in the eShop where you can purchase all those games?

778
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yes, because it's so adorable, because you hit the button and a little Zelda screen that comes up that says,

779
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Buy something, will ya? Oh, that's so cute!

780
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But it's not to buy extra levels in NES Remix, it's to take you to the eShop to buy the Virtual Console games.

781
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I don't know.

782
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
NES Remix left me feeling very conflicted.

783
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I liked a lot of the things they tried to do with it, but as the game went on, my patience for some of the NES classics,

784
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,000
using the term loosely in the Hershey's Dark Chocolate games, if you will, were starting to wear thin on me a little bit.

785
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And I don't know, I only am playing it now to see what the different Remix levels are,

786
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
but when I unlock a Remix level that's like, Play golf and get a hole in two in the rain!

787
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm like, Go fuck yourself! I don't feel like playing that.

788
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Luckily you can skip stages and stuff, but I don't know.

789
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I thought when I originally saw the headline for that, I was like,

790
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Oh look, they're doing a legitimate version of Super Mario Brothers Crossover.

791
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But then it was like WarioWare.

792
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But I don't know, it's a little more than WarioWare to me.

793
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Because WarioWare again is hitting one button or doing one thing.

794
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The NES Remix is more bite-sized chunks.

795
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But it kind of serves as a big advertisement for Virtual Console, I don't know.

796
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Go look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

797
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, Does NES Remix do leaderboards or anything?

798
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
No. But it does have Miiverse integration,

799
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
and when you see posts from either strangers or your friends,

800
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
it will show what their time was when they made the post.

801
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So I don't know why there's not leaderboards in there,

802
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
because they obviously are tracking the times.

803
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Because it would look really terrible if you bought that game and you're like,

804
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Hey, I'm gonna go buy one of these Virtual Console games.

805
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
What, no, leaderboard for this game? What the hell?

806
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
BlackWolf says, The main thing you need to know is that Retro Game Challenge for DS is awesome and it's the same people.

807
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
That's a very good point. It is the same people that made Retro Game Challenge for the DS.

808
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I would have rather just had that on the Wii U,

809
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
or like a new version of that on the Wii U with like new games or Super Nintendo games or something.

810
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I would love that. But that's not what it is.

811
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So I don't know. My feedback on NES Remix is mixed.

812
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It's truly a mixed review.

813
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Like if you really like retro NES games and you're willing to stomach some of it,

814
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
and $15 doesn't seem too high of a price for you,

815
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
then I say go ahead and go for it.

816
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
But just realize when you play it, you're gonna get a little disappointed

817
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
that you've spent money on other Virtual Console titles,

818
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and yet NES Remix does more in some of its bite-sized chunks that Virtual Console refuses.

819
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I think that's the best word to use. Nintendo refuses to do with Virtual Console.

820
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
They refuse to innovate it.

821
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Because I'm left to believe that it's not that they can't, it's not that they won't.

822
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
They refuse because NES Remix shows that they can do more with it.

823
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Is that any different from any other publishers, consoles, classic game revivals?

824
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Well, sure. Like Capcom Arcade Cabinet's pretty cool.

825
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
You can do multiplayer online, and you can do the replays that save,

826
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and the top high scores, you can look at the little playthroughs,

827
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and you have the HD graphics filters, and that's all pretty cool.

828
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And that's just the first collection that came off the top of my head.

829
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Because I haven't played a revival set in a very long time,

830
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
but I'm thinking back to like PS2, like the Midway arcade classics,

831
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
and all that kind of stuff, the various Namco collections.

832
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
But that was on the PlayStation 2, where a lot of this integration isn't exactly possible.

833
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Mostly network-based, and friends, and community, and all that kind of stuff.

834
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Modern consoles that do have that information? Okay, I agree. That makes sense.

835
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Jason, you saw me playing NES Remix for a little bit.

836
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I know you didn't get to touch it yourself, but certainly you're familiar with the Nintendo classics.

837
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
What if you wanted to touch it, Rob?

838
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'll go get the tablet now, and he can play.

839
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Which, by the way, also interesting to note, tablet does nothing.

840
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It's just a second screen, like many Wii U games of late. Just an interesting observation.

841
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
But anyway, Jason, you were watching me play. Any thoughts from watching?

842
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I know you didn't get to touch, but just...

843
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I live for those kind of games.

844
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I was backseat gaming the whole time Rob was playing.

845
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's like, you could have just dodged it.

846
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
He was playing classic Mario Brothers, with the three layers,

847
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and you have to hit the block with an enemy on it to flip the turtle upside down,

848
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
hit the monkey red demon things twice, all that kind of stuff.

849
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And I was like, you could have just gone up a level temporarily in order to dodge that fireball.

850
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I was backseat gaming the whole freaking time.

851
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I live for that kind of game.

852
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
If I had a Wii U, I would get that in a heartbeat.

853
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It was very fun. It was very fun looking.

854
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It looked like it controlled well.

855
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That is with regard to how the game played originally.

856
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It was not improved, which is kind of a good thing,

857
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
because it was meant to be something specific.

858
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It was the most prominent parts of all of the games that you played,

859
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
which is exactly the same for every single hole in golf,

860
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
but the bits of Zelda where you pick up the Triforce,

861
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
dodging enemies to go get the magic sword, the white sword that you picked up,

862
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
it looked commendable.

863
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It looked really fun, and not only the games by themselves,

864
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
but those remixed levels looked outstandingly fun.

865
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I likened it to Dance Master mode in DDR since Extreme US,

866
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
just subtle little variations on existing content to come up with something brand new.

867
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
It looked fun. I would not mind playing that.

868
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
You'd pay $15 for it?

869
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
That's really hard to say right now.

870
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I definitely would to try it out.

871
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Would I feel like it was still worth it afterwards? I have no idea.

872
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I didn't touch it. I just watched, but it looked fun.

873
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Alright, fair enough.

874
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Show where every gamer has a voice. What do you guys think about NES Remix?

875
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Tell us in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com,

876
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
or if you've played the game, maybe you disagree with some of the things I've said.

877
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Maybe you're overwhelmingly positive or overwhelmingly negative.

878
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Some of the websites out there ran very negative reviews of the game this week.

879
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I'd like to try it.

880
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And I want to say again, I'm leaving it with a mixed review,

881
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
because there was elements of what Jason's saying that I liked too.

882
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Again, I think some of these games are best experienced in bite sizes,

883
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
but I don't know. There is some inherent frustration that came from this game as well.

884
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
It is what it is. Take it or leave it.

885
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Anyway, we need to move on with the show and get into some of the other news.

886
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Let me talk quickly about housekeeping.

887
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
We will be here next week. We aren't planning on taking time off for the holidays,

888
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
just because Sunday's fall on pretty good days this year,

889
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
where we can do shows uninterrupted.

890
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So we will be here next week.

891
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

892
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

893
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
We're on Google Plus as well, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

894
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Even if they're being bastards.

895
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah, we'll get into that later.

896
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I also want to give a plug for this real quick,

897
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
because I think tomorrow is the last day that you can nominate for...

898
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
No, I think it's today, actually. It's the last day you can nominate for the Stitcher Awards.

899
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So maybe this won't do anything for our podcast listeners,

900
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
but for our live listeners would love it if you would head on over to the Stitcher website

901
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
and nominate us for Best Games and Hobbies Podcast.

902
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Would really, really appreciate that.

903
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And your nominations go a long way in helping us get recognized.

904
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And remember, we don't...

905
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I mean, it's not that like we're sitting here going,

906
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
we deserve to get all these awards.

907
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
No, we just realized that as an independently produced show,

908
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
the exposure that comes with even getting nominated is invaluable.

909
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You know, that's more what we're going for.

910
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Help us be exposed.

911
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Yeah, help us expose ourselves all over the internet.

912
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Would really appreciate that.

913
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
All right, and then I know some other vlog shows definitely worthy of nominations.

914
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Some of you guys have been like nominating Bobby one day and us one day. That's cool.

915
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I know Understation Live wants to do Most Original,

916
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
and I think that's perfect for them. It's great. I hope they get that.

917
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And certainly, you know, there's other TV and entertainment categories

918
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
where, you know, critical myth, pod culture, British invaders will all be great choices and so on.

919
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So there you go.

920
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And yes, SSG100Matt says nominate and give all the vlog shows a nice review on Stitcher.

921
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Yes, and thank you. SSG100Matt, I saw your review on Stitcher this week,

922
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
and thank you. That was great.

923
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So those reviews really, really help.

924
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
So I really appreciate it.

925
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And thanks to everybody at Stitcher and everywhere that's listening to podcasts for supporting the show.

926
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Really appreciate it.

927
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I hope you're having a good time listening and participating with our show.

928
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Let's get into some news.

929
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Loki's going to start us off.

930
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Okay, so this was kind of unexpected when they were talking about games coming out during the whole Nintendo Direct.

931
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
It's a new Zelda game.

932
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Not exactly the Zelda game you might have been looking forward to, but it's a new one.

933
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And it's being dubbed right now Hyrule Warriors.

934
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's basically a spinoff of the Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors series.

935
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And it's just like that.

936
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:05,000
But now set in Hyrule, you play Link, and it's got all the different enemies and stuff from the series.

937
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And the same kind of gameplay you expect from a Dynasty Warriors game.

938
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So it's supposed to come out sometime in 2014 for the Wii U.

939
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
What do you think about this?

940
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I think it looks neat.

941
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I think it would be a little bit more successful if it was compared to Monster Hunter.

942
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Because some of the screenshots, especially where they were going up against some of the boss monsters and stuff.

943
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It reminded me a little bit of Monster Hunter.

944
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So I don't know, it looks neat.

945
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
More than one Zelda game in a year is always good.

946
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Yet another thing VGX was snubbed for from Nintendo.

947
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
We were just talking about it.

948
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I think it's interesting that we have another game where Nintendo is allowed a third party one of their big franchises.

949
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I mean, granted, it's a spinoff game and not a main game.

950
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
We know Team Ninja and Metroid, and some people liked it, some people didn't.

951
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
But it was an interesting experiment.

952
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So I think it's very interesting that we have Zelda as a big one.

953
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:16,000
To let Koei Tecmo do a Dynasty Warriors type of game with that is a pretty big deal.

954
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com reminding us that Hyrule Warriors is the working title.

955
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It could have a different title later.

956
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Who knows, maybe they'll give it a Legend of Zelda and a subtitle.

957
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Because if you think about it, things like Phantom Hourglass were kind of not really Zelda games.

958
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
But they were still in that canon.

959
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
But they played very differently, so we'll see.

960
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:46,000
SSG100Matt says if Nintendo was really smart, they would have other Nintendo characters as unlockables or DLC heroes to play with.

961
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Well, I wonder if some of the characters from Dynasty Warriors wouldn't show up.

962
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
It would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

963
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Dark Soccer, I don't know if you've seen a lot about this game.

964
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Dan and I talked about it.

965
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yeah, do you have interest in it?

966
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Not really.

967
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I mean, but we were talking about Nintendo having this history of doing spin-offs with the Legend of Zelda series and marketing it out.

968
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Like how there were the licenses given for the 3DO and all that in the background.

969
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And we were talking about Phantom Hourglass and the Lynx crossbow training.

970
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
It's another cash grab, really.

971
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Well, you remember, this isn't the first time they've done a crossover with Tecmo Koei either.

972
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I think they had, was it Romance of the Three Kingdoms with Pokemon?

973
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Or it was Nebunaga's Ambition, one of those.

974
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That's right, I forgot about that. You're right.

975
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Tech2030 in our chatroom says Nintendo Warriors would have been a much better game.

976
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Maybe something a little more inclusive of other characters.

977
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I don't know, I think there's a lot of people that are going to buy it on Zelda alone.

978
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
If I was going to do one, I would pick one of the Fire Emblem franchises.

979
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Since you've got more characters to choose from, and I believe that the play style is similar.

980
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But then again, they just say, oh, it's another Fire Emblem game.

981
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Right. I'd be curious to see what happens with that game.

982
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Tech2030 actually mentioned Marth.

983
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Alright, well something else that came out of Nintendo Direct, another game announcement.

984
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It is Dr. Luigi! Because of course it is the year Luigi, is it not?

985
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
So Dr. Luigi will be kind of the last big hurrah for Luigi in the year of Luigi.

986
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It will be hitting the Wii U eShop on December 31st.

987
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And as you can probably guess, Dr. Luigi, it's Dr. Mario, but starring Luigi.

988
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Now it is being done for the Wii U.

989
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It will have an online mode, which means you can go head to head with two player.

990
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Which you don't hear very often when Nintendo games, that's pretty exciting.

991
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Dr. Luigi will play very similar to the classic NES game.

992
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
However, there will be a new twist.

993
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Operation L is a new mode in the game.

994
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And it will feature L-shaped blocks of the two capsules fused together with three matching color blocks within the block.

995
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
So you have to match four colors together, but it's still a little easier than the original Dr. Mario.

996
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So it will be very interesting to see how that all plays out.

997
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
You know, I have to admit, when I first heard about this, I was like, oh cool, that will be a lot of fun to play.

998
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And then I thought, didn't they do this on the Wii? And they did.

999
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I don't know if you guys remember, but they actually released Dr. Mario on the Wii, and it was almost like the same thing.

1000
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I mean, it didn't have the Operation L, that's a new thing.

1001
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But it had the two player online mode, and I think I remember back then talking about it going,

1002
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
oh yay, finally a Wii game by Nintendo that's like head to head online, that's really exciting.

1003
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And I think most people bought Dr. Mario, played it for a day, online against like one friend, and then probably never touched it again.

1004
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
So I can't help but wonder if Dr. Luigi is going to meet a similar fate.

1005
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Granted, if they get their money, they don't care if you play it for one day or a hundred days.

1006
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But, what do you guys think about Dr. Luigi?

1007
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I don't have a Wii U.

1008
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah.

1009
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So, just come over here and play it.

1010
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Is that a system seller for you, Dr. Luigi?

1011
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
No. If Dan and I were going to have bought a system, it would be for WinWicker HD.

1012
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And we clearly haven't bought one yet, so it's not a seller, honestly.

1013
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,000
If I really, really wanted to play Dr. Mario, I'd hook up my NES. That's it.

1014
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Fair enough. Jason, any interest in this?

1015
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I was pretty terrible at Dr. Mario.

1016
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,000
It's a game and it's continuing a trend of something that Nintendo's been wanting to do topically.

1017
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It's cute, cool, probably wouldn't buy it.

1018
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
No, I have to say I was really good at Dr. Mario.

1019
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I'd get up to like level 30 something.

1020
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I seem to remember always fast forwarding myself to like level 15 or level 20 or something like that.

1021
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And always dying incredibly quickly and being very frustrated and not playing the game again.

1022
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:53,000
That's why you have to start at the beginning. If you start from the beginning and build up, you acclimatize to the speed.

1023
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It was one of those things where I didn't want to start from scratch and I wanted to make it actually difficult, but I would always make it too difficult.

1024
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And I never found that a happy medium.

1025
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I'm also talking like years and years and years ago, so I really don't remember how it all wound up playing out.

1026
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:16,000
But maybe if I'm looking for something to pad up a library with, but yeah, no particular interest in jumping on this real quick.

1027
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Loki, is this a system seller for you?

1028
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh, totally. No, I mean, seriously, Luigi's a terrible doctor, right?

1029
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Shoving L-shaped pills down someone's throat, it's just a choking hazard.

1030
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I can't help but feel like games like this and NES Remix were really rushed just to try and beef up Nintendo's offerings on the eShop for better or for worse.

1031
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I mean, I guess I really can't complain. As much as I might have been a little bit critical of NES Remix earlier, there were good things about it too.

1032
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And even this, I might see some negative, but I think it's very exciting that we have an online classic game.

1033
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I mean, everything I've bitched about wanting on Virtual Console, Dr. Luigi does kind of deliver, so I'm excited to see that.

1034
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So, I mean, if Nintendo were to rush games like this every couple months or whatever, I wouldn't be mad.

1035
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I'd like to see more of this type of stuff, especially with some of the classics. I think it would be pretty cool.

1036
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I agree with Fifth Dream, by the way. I can't play Dr. Mario. I'm too good at it and games go on for hours.

1037
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
This is true.

1038
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Jeez.

1039
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:35,000
No, no, no. This is true. If you're good at Dr. Mario, you have to jinx yourself. You cannot start the game and just play through it and be done. It doesn't happen.

1040
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
That's my problem with Civilization V. I'm just too good at it and suddenly it's 4 AM in the morning.

1041
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Rob, I've had 3 hour game session of Dr. Mario.

1042
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Alright, alright. I'm trying to think of a game recently that I've done something like that with.

1043
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Do you remember Every Extend Extra Extreme?

1044
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yes.

1045
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But I'm such a horror.

1046
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I've had your copy forever.

1047
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm such a horror for Q Entertainment. Well, they had it on an Xbox 360 and I remember I could play that game.

1048
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I mean, you just keep creating the explosions and do it on the beach. You can keep that game going for hours as well.

1049
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Now, remember when I was super drunk at my birthday and I played Lumines and got to level 25 while I was super, super drunk?

1050
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And I had to actually kill myself so that I could drink my beer?

1051
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That was fun.

1052
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
BlackWolf in our chat room says, humble brag.

1053
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I apparently am better at puzzle games when I'm really drunk, by the way.

1054
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It gets you in a state of zen. Alright.

1055
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I was in a state of I'm on my 8th beverage.

1056
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Well, Dark Soccer, I know you're sober, but maybe you can read the next story for us anyway.

1057
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Yeah, maybe I could do that.

1058
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:49,000
So, there is, for all the people who are super hyper pissed off at YouTube, like just about everybody,

1059
01:06:49,000 --> 01:07:00,000
there is a wiki set up so that you can find basically what's going to let you do a Let's Play and monetize it.

1060
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Maybe, and it does not allow.

1061
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So, it's a wiki page called Who Let's Play and you can go check out the information there.

1062
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:20,000
There is a quote saying that right now the issue is with music and developers are, you know, basically have licensed music non-exclusively.

1063
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So, that means you might be able to, you know, show a game and the game developer will be fine with it,

1064
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
but the person who created the music has licensed it out to multiple people and not be so cool with it.

1065
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:42,000
But the wiki page is useful out there for, you know, knowing what you can and can't do, if in doubt you can check.

1066
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And there's a second wiki that's for, and it says in quotes, known bad actors who are basically, I guess,

1067
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
it says something about music resellers, so I'm not really sure about that.

1068
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:07,000
But there, you know, it's basically labeling out who you can trust, who you can't trust, and what you're going to be able to do as far as that content.

1069
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Just to clarify though, it will not stop YouTube necessarily from holding up your videos.

1070
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And the reason why I point that out.

1071
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
They're dicks.

1072
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Well, yes, and I know Loki's going to explain a little more what's going on in a minute here,

1073
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,000
but just what's going on with me personally right now on my own channel, my video, my struggle,

1074
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
is that the other day I posted a video playing Final Fantasy XIV.

1075
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I don't even remember what we were doing in it.

1076
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Oh, yeah, it was the last night of the 2.0 patch.

1077
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
So we were just running around talking.

1078
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It was almost like a little mini podcast.

1079
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
It was a lot of fun.

1080
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
And you can check that out on my channel at Rob Roberts Plays.

1081
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
If you're a Final Fantasy XIV fan, we had a lot of fun with that.

1082
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And YouTube flagged it saying, and it wasn't, it was one of those weird things where it wasn't a copyright claim.

1083
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It didn't say that somebody had claimed the copyright.

1084
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
It just said, we don't believe that this is your content.

1085
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
You need to prove to us that it's your content if you want to monetize it.

1086
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Now, I don't have dreams of making thousands of dollars off YouTube videos,

1087
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:07,000
but if I could get one of my videos to go viral and maybe pay for some new microphones for OLR, that would be awesome.

1088
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
You know, that's my deal with it.

1089
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So I was a little pissed off to see that YouTube flagged the video for literally no reason than they just, they want me to prove I own it.

1090
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Well, the game was Final Fantasy XIV.

1091
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I believe that's listed on this wiki, or if it's not, it should be, because on Square's website, it says,

1092
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
you can post this on our partner's site, which includes YouTube, and you can make the monetization.

1093
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Because it was a huge deal.

1094
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
At first, they said no monetization, and they reversed their policy.

1095
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
That was a big deal a few months ago when the game first came out.

1096
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So it kind of pissed me off that YouTube flagged it for literally no reason.

1097
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And now the views that I am getting, which of course I'm going to get the most views before the patch is out, I didn't get monetization on.

1098
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Now, alright, so maybe I lost a quarter, but it's the principle of the thing.

1099
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And I'm a small time channel, but what about the big time channels that this happened with?

1100
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,000
So that just, I'm just saying, even though this wiki is out there, it's not going to stop this crap from happening.

1101
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Anyway, let me let Loki, because I know Loki has some more things to elaborate on this with.

1102
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I was just going to say though, it's good that someone's taking the time to at least put the information out there.

1103
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's good to know where people stand and to be able to easily educate yourself before you get into the Let's Play business.

1104
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And that it's a wiki, people can update it too. So it is the community.

1105
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Yes. Loki.

1106
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Alright, so YouTube, of course, making a comment regarding this whole fiasco, I guess, and pretty much just sticking by their content ID system.

1107
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And they had helpful tips, of course, that's great.

1108
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:55,000
So they basically said, last week we expanded the system to scan more channels, including those affiliated with multi-channel networks.

1109
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
As a result, some channels, including many gaming channels, saw claims appear against their videos from audio or video copyright holders.

1110
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Keep in mind, one video may contain multiple copyrighted works, and any of which can potentially result in a claim.

1111
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Online rights are often resold to companies like music labels and aggregators.

1112
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
While you might not recognize the owner, this doesn't necessarily mean their claim is invalid.

1113
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:33,000
And know that we love what you do. We've worked hard to design the content ID and other tools to give everyone from individual creators to media companies the opportunity to make great videos and money.

1114
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Yeah, that didn't really help, except for the fact that it's monetizing people's videos that really fall under fair use, and the whole thing where you're having a robot do a human's job.

1115
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Yeah, it's a big ol' mess.

1116
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But to kind of help a little with that, there is a brand new non-profit resource that's kind of based off that whole who lets play.

1117
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And what they're doing is allowing, I guess, some support for people that may have been flagged by the content ID system.

1118
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And their brand new website knows the website will have some standard legal language that will be available to everyone to use and educate them on these legal minefields in a simple and clear way.

1119
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:39,000
We also like to create some badges, much like Creative Commons does, that go along with licensed materials which developers can use to advertise on what legal grounds they stand on advertising that their music is safe to use.

1120
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:53,000
So basically just kind of going along the lines of that who lets play wiki resource, but expanding it from not just game content, but to music resources and stuff like that.

1121
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Because there were some people that were actually getting their videos flagged because they had purchased music libraries, and they were using some of this music that they licensed in their videos, and now those are being flagged by the original music owner and stuff like that.

1122
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Now am I correct in thinking that because it says it has online legal resources and language, they'll have templates that I can actually use in contesting my videos?

1123
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Yeah, I think so.

1124
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Nice.

1125
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:32,000
So next time we get an episode of Orange Lounge Radio flagged as, we don't believe you own this content, I can paste language in there that will get that turned over as opposed to denied, which happened this past week.

1126
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Told by YouTube, we do not own the show.

1127
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Yeah, pretty much.

1128
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Anyway.

1129
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Alright, and then last but not least, there was also this issue with some of the music from Terry Cavanagh's VVV.

1130
01:13:51,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It was being claimed by some company called TuneCore, and the whole situation with that I guess is that TuneCore as well as InMusic, they are partnered I guess.

1131
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:29,000
He maybe had his music going through InMusic, and what TuneCore has done is actually helped with the monetization and getting these videos that have their music monetized if it's not the original artist and stuff, and also getting them onto different platforms including iTunes and stuff like that.

1132
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:56,000
The problem is though, they're I guess going to only whitelist, I guess now they're going to only whitelist those tracks for the original author, but for example if the creator of VVV wants to allow other people to use their gameplay footage in Let's Play videos and stuff, they're not going to authorize, or TuneCore's not going to authorize them to make money off those videos.

1133
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:05,000
They're basically going to collect all the money from it and give only a portion of it to the original copyright owner. So it's kind of a mess there as well.

1134
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So why on earth would I want to sign up for this TuneCore thing in the first place?

1135
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I don't know.

1136
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:18,000
What's the benefit? Why did the VVV guys sign up for this in the first place? Maybe he thought he was going to get protected and instead...

1137
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I think it was more of like just maybe to get the soundtracks up on different music networks out there, iTunes, and wherever else that's being played through and maybe get monetization from that, but he probably never thought that it would come back to bite him on YouTube.

1138
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:54,000
The role of a publisher in this scenario, exactly like Loki just said, is that you turn your materials into one source and they go quite literally everywhere, still offering you the control of where you actually want them to be.

1139
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Amazon MP3, iTunes, Spotify, RDO, Pandora, CD Baby, etc.

1140
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Thank you, I get it now. Bobby's clarifying in chat as well. TuneCore gets you on Spotify, iTunes, etc. They're one of the easier music distribution companies. I see, I get it.

1141
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:23,000
An artist friend of mine that lives near back home showed me some of the analytics that they get and it's really impressive. They have a per network breakdown of where they've been making money.

1142
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:32,000
So much so that not only is there iTunes revenue, but there's iTunes match revenue, which is its own independent source of where you can actually make money.

1143
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:46,000
The problem is that these companies have a stranglehold of sales and reproduction and performance practically everywhere on the internet because they are a digital distribution source.

1144
01:16:49,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I understand the benefit and until, it's so hard as an individual to work with every single one of those outlets, so I understand the middleman in this particular scenario for now.

1145
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Things might change as if services actually get to a point where they give the individual artist or group what have you like more thorough control easier or people just want to make like do it all individually so they own all the terms and do not have these conflicts.

1146
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:27,000
People are going to start learning and that might be something that has to happen now and it's only, you know, it's only easier every single day to put your music somewhere on your own.

1147
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:38,000
To put your music on a network somewhere on your own. That said, these services exist for a reason. They solve a lot of problems for people that are out there to get their name out there and reap the benefit of it.

1148
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Well, all I know is that this YouTube stuff is growing thin on the community as a whole real quick.

1149
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And I know there's some people out there that are like, well, people are going to just keep going to YouTube because it's, you know, the only place for it.

1150
01:17:51,000 --> 01:18:02,000
But when some competitors start coming out and start doing it better, I'm sure, I'm sure somebody at Twitch TV is thinking right now, how can we turn this into a situation that's better for ourselves and our market share?

1151
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:15,000
If you don't think people will abandon ship in mass when something better comes along, MySpace would like to welcome you back. Please, Justin Timberlake owns us now. Please, come on back. MySpace, we're cool.

1152
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I do very easily think that people will go somewhere better, but as far as you, but as far as like YouTube going away is not going to happen.

1153
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Well, MySpace didn't go away.

1154
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
That's up for debate.

1155
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Friendster's still around.

1156
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Is that actually the case?

1157
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Yes, I think. I think it's like, it's big in Asia, I think.

1158
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And then Orkut's big in Brazil.

1159
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Will a better network exist?

1160
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Yes, absolutely. But the benefit of YouTube is that millions of eyeballs are there.

1161
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Well, and plus, you know, for better or worse, YouTube has at least if nothing else, all the archive stuff. They've got so much stuff on there.

1162
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:02,000
But I think as far as like gamers moving, I think the gaming community may absolutely move somewhere else, especially if a targeted gaming YouTube comes out.

1163
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:08,000
But then the question is who would advertise on it? Because keep in mind, that's what this is all about is advertiser and who you see advertiser dollars.

1164
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Every single one of the publishers.

1165
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
If Twitch TV can exist, a gaming YouTube can exist as well.

1166
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I absolutely agree with that aspect. Things somebody can make can build a better service and they will.

1167
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
If PornTube exists.

1168
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Well, the other thing too is, you know, I'm surprised that like, you know, a company like TuneCore in music or whatever doesn't have a way, I'm sure they did on purpose, but doesn't have a way to like say,

1169
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:44,000
okay, I don't want you to worry about monetizing music on YouTube. You know, I only want it on iTunes and, you know, wherever Stitcher or wherever it's going.

1170
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:53,000
You know, so if, you know, they could somehow get around it that way. But of course, now that they know that they can make money off of, you know, flagging these things.

1171
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Of course, now they're not going to have that loophole in there.

1172
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And TuneCore wants to make their money too, right?

1173
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh, yeah.

1174
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
This is how they do it.

1175
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:09,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase shadow.

1176
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:16,000
All right, let's move on. I'm sure lots of lots of other thoughts on this. We might get some emails on it the next week, but for now, let's move on with the show.

1177
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Jason, this is not the classic game of the week, but think back to 1993 with me.

1178
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:34,000
DOS was the preeminent IBM operating system. Windows 95 was still being built, I guess, early days of AOL.

1179
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
My 386, my 386 SX16 was the bomb.

1180
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Playing Doom.

1181
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
We still had these things called floppy disks, because nuts to optical media.

1182
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Calling into BBSs to play The Pit.

1183
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So was I.

1184
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And don't copy that floppy.

1185
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And a wonderful little game from LucasArts called X-Wing was released.

1186
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:05,000
The first in a series of three games that pretty much set the standard for space dogfights.

1187
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And bolstered by Wing Commander and plenty of other games at the time.

1188
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:21,000
If you miss those days, like I do, 2014 is going to be an amazing year because of the announcement of Star Wars Attack Squadrons.

1189
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Area 52, in conjunction with Disney and LucasArts, are going to publish a up to 16 person multiplayer space battles game under the name Star Wars Attack Squadrons.

1190
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Please, please, please go to starwars.com slash attack squadrons and sign up for the beta now.

1191
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Because this game is going to be out in, they're saying currently, the first half of next year.

1192
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
It is going to be amazing.

1193
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Even though Star Wars Old Republic got its space flight off rails and actually starting battles, there is room for a dedicated game of this caliber.

1194
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I can't wait. I have nothing else, I have plenty of other things to say.

1195
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Oculus Rift would make this amazing. I need to go get a flight stick joystick.

1196
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
This game is going to be outstanding.

1197
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Considering that it is actually going to have, the only games confirmed, sorry, the only ships confirmed right now are the X-Wing and the TIE Fighter.

1198
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:32,000
But invariably they are going to build that out so that the rebels have X, A, Y, and B-Wings, possibly also the Z-95 Headhunter from X-Wing and TIE Fighter, X-Wing versus TIE Fighter and all that.

1199
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And then invariably the Imperial side will have at least the TIE Fighter, TIE Interceptor, TIE Bomber, and we'll see what else they come up with.

1200
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I can't wait. Period.

1201
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You're very excited, I can't wait.

1202
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:59,000
TIE Fighter, X-Wing versus TIE Fighter is like, you know, I played so many games as a kid, mostly demos, but TIE Fighter was that game that I got through on my own.

1203
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And maybe cheated a little bit because the cheat codes were right in the menu and that game was fucking impossible if you didn't have invulnerability and infinite missiles.

1204
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:16,000
But anyways, I had so much fun with that game, and then they released the CD-ROM version and they had the four bonus campaign missions.

1205
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I just, everything that was built about that game had the right look, I am so happy to see this news again.

1206
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Everybody, you know, people have wanted a game like this for a while, LucasArts closing down didn't do any favors,

1207
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Old Republic, I don't want to be attached to an MMO just to, you know, dogfight in space.

1208
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
This is good news, I cannot wait to see what happens with it.

1209
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Bochikawa on chat at live.vognetwork.com says, wow fun stuff, so glad they're revisiting this.

1210
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Dungeonbuster says, I didn't care much for X-Wing versus TIE Fighter though because it didn't have a single player campaign.

1211
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
What?

1212
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:02,000
It did, it had a single player campaign, it had a story, you had to examine ships and take out defense platforms and escort the emperor.

1213
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
There was very much a campaign.

1214
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Alright, well I hope these renaissance type games do well and lead way to other things.

1215
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I wasn't super into the Star Wars games, I know some people were.

1216
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Shame on you.

1217
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Well I like Super Star Wars on Super Nintendo, that was the Star Wars game I enjoyed.

1218
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,000
But I did love the old Wing Commander games, like Wing Commander 1 and 2, good stuff.

1219
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I don't think I ever actually owned Wing Commander, which is why it's not as prominent in my brain.

1220
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I played at least 3 and 4, possibly 1 or 2, I don't remember, but there has been nothing like those games in over a decade now.

1221
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
So this is just straight up good news.

1222
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Alright, Dark Saga, what do you have for us?

1223
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I've got some stuff. How about Hearthstone?

1224
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:57,000
People have been looking forward to it and Blizzard has been kind of pimping it, however the open beta has been delayed.

1225
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:04,000
And it looks like it's going to be done next month, so they're holding it off.

1226
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It sounds like they're doing some more testing before they do it and they said they don't want to rush it.

1227
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Don't want to rush it. Make it slower.

1228
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:25,000
But they did say that the invites for the closed beta have already gone out and if you don't have it, check your spam folder.

1229
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
For those who signed up for it.

1230
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Which, by the way, it's about freaking time this open beta gets here.

1231
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I realize it's been delayed again, but Hearthstone is a beta. I don't know why it's still in beta.

1232
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:50,000
The game is fully functional. Yes, there's still some balance issues to be worked out, but the longer it goes on, the more I stop caring about this game.

1233
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Because it's like, I don't need to see another freaking beta key giveaway.

1234
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Who is not in this game now that doesn't want to be in it?

1235
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
It's like a Google product. You're really still not in the beta and you want it?

1236
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I don't know. I've never quite liked card games, but it looks fun and I would not mind.

1237
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I'm sure somebody in chat has an extra key here. I think Grandpa from Horde House has one. We can get you.

1238
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Also, they're saying opt-ins for the closed beta end on January 7th. You can opt in on battle.net.

1239
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Because they need to just take the freaking game live already. It's a little ridiculous.

1240
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I don't know. Again, it's like a Google product that stays in beta forever and it's past the joke.

1241
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Tech2030 in chat asking, Hearthstone is going to be free to play, right? Yes.

1242
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:44,000
If you want to buy new decks though, that's where the money is from the decks and so forth.

1243
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1244
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Although, I think this will probably be a pretty quick segment, being what week it is.

1245
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
But let's check in anyway. Loki?

1246
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
You get a whole bunch of coal. There's nothing.

1247
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Nothing. Is there anything coming out right after the holidays?

1248
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Do we have any? Because I remember last year, we got some pretty big stuff right after the holidays.

1249
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Ni No Kuni was just two weeks after the holidays. Is there anything in 2014 looking like that?

1250
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Honestly, the next thing in 2014 is going to be January 10th and that's just a disc release of We Fit You.

1251
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And that's it. The new stuff doesn't come until literally the last week of January.

1252
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
So it's going to be a whole lot of nothing for a few weeks now.

1253
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
If they added a G and an H, that would be We Fight You.

1254
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan. There is some news this week because Christmas is very different in Japan.

1255
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So right after you chat down on some Christmas cake, you can go out on December 26th and check out Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters.

1256
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
They are coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

1257
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
What can I do for you?

1258
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
They are getting it in Japan a little bit before We Are.

1259
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,000
But PlayStation 3 is region-free, so some of you guys might be importing that.

1260
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
You can also check out Ampersand or And.

1261
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
The title is like an ampersand.

1262
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:16,000
And then Sora no Muko de Sakimasu yoni in regular and limited edition.

1263
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Oh, a cutesy game.

1264
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Yeah, it looks like, you know, Happy Let's See, but that is the title of the game.

1265
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It's like an ampersand.

1266
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
So I don't know if that's like a, is that an anime that I don't know of?

1267
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I don't think so.

1268
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I don't know, but it's cute girls fighting and that whole thing, you know.

1269
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Looks like she's like walking around with a surrender flag or something.

1270
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It's kind of weird.

1271
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I don't know.

1272
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It's an adventure game.

1273
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
It's from Five PB is putting that out in Japan.

1274
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Checking out some of the other consoles on the Xbox 360.

1275
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Nada, nothing this week.

1276
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
On the PlayStation Vita, the Ampersand game is there too,

1277
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
as well as the X and X-2 HD remasters are there as well.

1278
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And there's also, I believe, a special box set with the PlayStation Vita

1279
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
and the X and X-2 all coming together.

1280
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
So that is on the PlayStation Vita.

1281
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
On the Wii U this week, nothing.

1282
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
But there is an accessory for Wii Karaoke U coming out on December 31st,

1283
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
a little mini speaker system.

1284
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,000
On the 3DS, A Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Worlds makes its way to Japan this week.

1285
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
That was one that we got first.

1286
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And they are getting that extra little console bundle that we got here as well.

1287
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
In fact, I want to see, does it look the exact same?

1288
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I'm kind of curious, because I actually haven't seen what the Japanese one looks like.

1289
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Yes, it is the exact same bundle we got here, except the box art is way better.

1290
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I like that box art way better.

1291
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
But it's that same 3DS, except of course it is a Japanese 3DS,

1292
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
because, you know, they're region locked and stuff.

1293
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
And lastly on the PSP this week,

1294
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Julik Nightmare in regular and limited edition,

1295
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,000
as well as Sengoku Hime 4 comes out this week on the PSP.

1296
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
There you go. How about the UK Dark Soccer?

1297
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
There's one thing on the list.

1298
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And it actually says December 25th.

1299
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 on everything.

1300
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
And yeah, it's listing everything practically.

1301
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Even the Spectrum. No, I'm kidding.

1302
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
No, it's not the Spectrum.

1303
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
It's coming out to finally dust off my 2600.

1304
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
It's on the MSX.

1305
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
You know, I've actually been chatting off and on with Catastrophic Moggy.

1306
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And he was telling me not too long ago about playing Strider on the Spectrum.

1307
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Nice.

1308
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
And I was like,

1309
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Hey Dan, you wanna play Strider on the Spectrum?

1310
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
And Dan's like,

1311
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
No.

1312
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's one of those things that probably sounds more fun than it really is.

1313
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
You know what I want?

1314
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Rose colored retro glasses.

1315
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
What I would love to get for my house.

1316
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
What?

1317
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Is a Duo RX.

1318
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
So that we can use an arcade card.

1319
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Or have a converter that we can use an arcade card with on our Duo.

1320
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Because we can't play his version of Strider for the PC Engine.

1321
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Without using an arcade card.

1322
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And of course the pen sets are different.

1323
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
So.

1324
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Anyway.

1325
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Alright.

1326
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Just a couple more news stories for you guys.

1327
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
And the classic game of the week.

1328
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Loki.

1329
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Alright.

1330
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
So, you know, of course everyone wants to know

1331
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
What was the most played game in 2013?

1332
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
And Raptor has the answer for that.

1333
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
They broke down the top five games.

1334
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Of course number one being my personal favorite.

1335
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Grand Theft Auto 5.

1336
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Surprise.

1337
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Followed by Call of Duty Ghosts.

1338
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
On Xbox 360.

1339
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And actually Grand Theft Auto 5 on 360 was number one.

1340
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Battlefield 4 on PC.

1341
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Dota 2 on PC.

1342
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And last but not least.

1343
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Final Fantasy XIV Online and Realm Reborn on PC.

1344
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Wow.

1345
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I didn't realize Realm Reborn was that high.

1346
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
But I'm also surprised that World of Warcraft, League of Legends.

1347
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Where are those games?

1348
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Well, they're all older.

1349
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,000
It's actually the most played that was based on a 30 day launch window.

1350
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
So actually the most played PC game of 2013 was League of Legends.

1351
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Aha.

1352
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Okay.

1353
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Alright.

1354
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Now it makes sense.

1355
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Got it.

1356
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I was like, surely League of Legends.

1357
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I mean, I know Dota 2 is very popular.

1358
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
So is League of Legends.

1359
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Alright.

1360
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
That makes a lot more sense.

1361
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
And still don't understand the point of using Raptor anymore.

1362
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Like, it was one of those things where it was cute at first.

1363
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
But now, why bother?

1364
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
What's Raptor's...

1365
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
What's the benefit of Raptor?

1366
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Let's log back into Xbox 360 Voice then.

1367
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Well, the whole thing is just like...

1368
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
E-peen.

1369
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
You know, like achievements.

1370
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Yeah, pretty much.

1371
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
You know, it just kind of like, oh, dammit.

1372
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
You know, Rob's outperforming me in this game.

1373
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I have to go play this game some more.

1374
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
That's basically it.

1375
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It's up to the minute E-peen.

1376
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
24 hour, 7 day, a week E-peen.

1377
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
It's cross network leaderboards.

1378
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Yeah.

1379
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Alright.

1380
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Yeah.

1381
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I'm not sure about the Raptor account.

1382
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I'm pretty sure.

1383
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It probably tracks my 360 progress.

1384
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
But, you know.

1385
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
When's the last time you turned that thing on?

1386
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
This week when I played Minecraft.

1387
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Oh, we were talking about that, weren't we?

1388
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Yeah.

1389
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Weren't you paying attention?

1390
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Sorry.

1391
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I was actually taking notes for the video.

1392
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
What did you say?

1393
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
That's my legal excuse here.

1394
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Minecraft.

1395
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Mine all the things.

1396
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
You know what?

1397
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Okay.

1398
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I have to say something else funny.

1399
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Side note.

1400
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Julian, when I picked him up from school on Friday, he said,

1401
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
can I play Minecraft at your house?

1402
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
And I said no.

1403
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Because I've uninstalled it.

1404
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I remember when you hated Minecraft, but you finally came around.

1405
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Like, that was some progress in 2013.

1406
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You finally came around to lukewarm on Minecraft.

1407
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I enjoy it.

1408
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I just removed it so that when I do my system stuff, I just cleaned everything off.

1409
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
She needed room for porn, porn, porn, porn.

1410
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
No.

1411
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I needed room for my fucking Steam games.

1412
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
God.

1413
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And then also, I was going to say, the most played Xbox 360 game.

1414
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Of course, total play time.

1415
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Call of Duty Black Ops 2, followed by Grand Theft Auto 5, and then Minecraft.

1416
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I thought it was interesting.

1417
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Oh, there you go.

1418
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
The fact that Grand Theft Auto 5 could jump up that high in gameplay hours for the last,

1419
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
what, two and a half months of the year, compared to everything else.

1420
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Not surprising, but kind of crazy.

1421
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Yeah, a little crazy that it's only out for a third of the year, if that, and tops the charts.

1422
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
But at the same time, not really.

1423
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Not really.

1424
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
All right.

1425
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
So many people freaking playing that game.

1426
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:14,000
This was an interesting development this week, and you know, there's been a lot of controversy,

1427
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000
and some of it we've talked about here on OLR, some of it we haven't, around Penny Arcade Expo.

1428
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:26,000
And I don't really know how to condense this into, but if you somehow don't know the controversy with Penny Arcade Expo,

1429
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
let me just put it this way.

1430
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:33,000
The guys behind it have a tendency to put their foot in their mouths every time.

1431
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,000
And just when you think they might have learned something, or they stick their foot right back in their mouth with some other comment.

1432
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,000
So that's really turned some people, rubbed some people the wrong way with Penny Arcade Expo,

1433
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
and there's definitely a call where they need to do the right thing, and they need to get the message out there,

1434
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:57,000
and they need to be a little more accepting of all types of gaming cultures and so forth.

1435
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,000
And anyhow, some plans came out this week, some leaked plans or whatever,

1436
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:08,000
some leaked information came out this week about Penny Arcade's planned diversity hub and lounge.

1437
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Oh God.

1438
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Hold on, I'm not done.

1439
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I know.

1440
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
This is going to be something that would be in a high traffic PAX area,

1441
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,000
that would be a resource for PAX attendees to find information related to issues surrounding women,

1442
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:25,000
LGBTQ, people of color, disabled people, mental health issues in gaming.

1443
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
It would be a resource for industry professionals and fans to interface in a setting focused on diversity,

1444
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
receive diversity training, learn more about diversity, and meet people from diverse communities.

1445
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And of course this was all mocked on Twitter in an instant.

1446
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Hashtag diversity lounge drinks, things of that nature.

1447
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Basically some folks kind of saying like, wow, they are literally shoving all of this in the corner.

1448
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
So I don't know, a lot of mixed feedback going on this,

1449
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,000
and we don't know if this is what PAX will actually end up implementing or whatever,

1450
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
but PAX East is coming up before we know it.

1451
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I made a decision not to go to PAX East that's rooted mostly in finance,

1452
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
but there was a small part of that where I was just like, you know what,

1453
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I don't know if I can continue to support some of this fuckery as much as I would love to see.

1454
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I know a lot of the oil army does go out to PAX East, just kind of one of those.

1455
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I just feel like I suspend the money on having a better experience at Dragon Con

1456
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
or going to some other convention.

1457
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I don't know, that's where I'm at personally, and this doesn't really exactly change my mind.

1458
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I have to admit when I read something like this, I'm just like, all right, look,

1459
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
PAX does a lot of panels.

1460
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Why not do some more panels?

1461
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,000
To be fair, they've done a pretty good job having a lot of diversity in panels and so forth.

1462
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:49,000
They have some of that speaking, and a lot of those groups I just named there

1463
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,000
tend to usually get a panel at PAX, and I think that's pretty cool.

1464
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,000
But on the other hand, I'm also like, why does it necessarily need to be a room?

1465
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I'm not saying that something like this has to take up the entire show floor,

1466
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,000
but what about something that builds awareness to maybe one of these causes

1467
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
as a booth that's out there on the show floor?

1468
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
What about some great gaming charities that could be out there on the show floor

1469
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
and really getting their information out there to maybe some of the people that need to hear it most?

1470
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
It is a little weird to hear that they want to put it in its own room.

1471
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I don't know. Any thoughts on this from you guys here in the studio or Loki on the phone?

1472
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
It's like they're throwing the bone out there to people and then shoving it in the corner.

1473
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I mean, really, it is exactly like that.

1474
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Not to mention that the guys keep having a tendency to repeatedly shove their foot in their mouth

1475
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
so deep that they're shitting toenails.

1476
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:49,000
So I don't know if it's too little, too late, and if they're really going about it the wrong way.

1477
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I would like to see the public booth. I would like to see something right available at every corner.

1478
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Here's where you can get your information.

1479
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:07,000
The whole thing reminds me of the office when Michael would try to have a diversity day and stuff,

1480
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,000
and it just goes horribly wrong, like they completely offend everybody in the process.

1481
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
It's kind of like that.

1482
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
There's a part of me, I've got to be honest, there's a part of me that's like, you know what,

1483
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:25,000
they don't, and maybe this is a controversial thing I'm about to say, so feel free to present your viewpoint respectfully if you think I'm wrong.

1484
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:30,000
But I'm just kind of like, you know, there's a part of me that thinks, you know what, they don't really need to even do this.

1485
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Just don't go out of your way to be all like, yay, we're going to have diversity day and hold hands.

1486
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:44,000
How about you apologize for what you said and mean it and just show through your actions in the future.

1487
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
That would mean so much more.

1488
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Because that would be too difficult, Rob.

1489
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I mean, that's the honest thing at the end of the day.

1490
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I don't need a room. I just need your actions to show that you care.

1491
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
And that's enough for me.

1492
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
But then if they do this, they don't have to change their behavior.

1493
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
They're making their token effort.

1494
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
And that's what bugs me about it.

1495
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Now, Rama wants to remind us in chat at live.vognetwork.com, it was a leaked memo, things might change.

1496
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
That's absolutely right.

1497
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,000
SHG100Matt says, tinfoil hat time, I wonder if they leaked it on purpose to see the reaction.

1498
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Queen Simia says, it's tokenism, I think.

1499
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
See, we're not totally sexist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynist.

1500
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
We put a room just for them over there.

1501
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
That's where I'm just like, you know what, why don't you just show through your actions you're not that way.

1502
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
And then just have a gaming convention and we're good.

1503
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:47,000
And to be fair, most corporations, especially a lot of the ones that you are going to have on the floor at your convention,

1504
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,000
have diversity training as part of their corporate training.

1505
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
You know how this goes, right?

1506
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1507
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I've been working, I worked for what was the money store for like ten years.

1508
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And we had freaking diversity training damn near every year.

1509
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Especially if you're in customer service.

1510
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:17,000
But yeah, it's just, it's, I'm at a loss because I want to say five different words at one time to describe it

1511
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
and none of them want to come to the floor.

1512
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:24,000
So I'm just going to say it's fuckery and leave it at that.

1513
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Jason, any final thoughts on this?

1514
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I had exactly the same thought, I had exactly the same point as you in that this seems exceedingly unnecessary

1515
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:41,000
when it's not born out of, the big story at the last PAX was not this born out of confrontation on the show floor

1516
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
or something between attendees.

1517
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Attendees.

1518
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:49,000
It was the fucking founder that was making stupid comments.

1519
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Wasn't it also like outside, just on the internet, not even, I don't remember if it happened a day of the show

1520
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:03,000
or shortly after or something like that, but it's like, one, he literally pulled a sorry not sorry on stage.

1521
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Basically.

1522
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Oh, I remember that portion of it.

1523
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:12,000
That was my impression of it anyway, is that you know, I said sorry for this once but I'm really not sorry.

1524
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I'm sorry I got caught.

1525
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Yeah, anyway.

1526
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Or my favorite thing, I'm sorry my words offended you.

1527
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Which means I'm not sorry for what I said, I'm just sorry that you called me on it.

1528
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Yeah, it's your problem, not mine.

1529
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
It seems foolish, it seems unnecessary.

1530
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:38,000
It definitely is putting the problem in the problem, quotey fingers, into a corner, whatever.

1531
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Yeah, whatever.

1532
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Alright, let's move on.

1533
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Let's go to a time when gaming was just, it didn't have all this fuckery as Jamie put it.

1534
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
It also didn't have all this diversity, but that's another topic.

1535
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
You know what?

1536
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
That's because everybody in video games was Japanese.

1537
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Not everybody.

1538
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Unless the game was pretty certain.

1539
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:07,000
But anyway, all that talk aside, it's the classic game of the week when maybe we were just younger and naive

1540
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
and that's really what it is, y'all.

1541
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1542
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Dark Sakura's gonna jump into the gaming vault and find a classic game that she thinks,

1543
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
hey, you kids should be playing this game this week and if you're not, I can't even with you.

1544
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Alright, here it is, Dark Sakura.

1545
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
What is the classic game of the week?

1546
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I will explain it a little bit.

1547
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I have been playing, I forgot to mention at the start of the show, a shit ton of Namco High.

1548
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
I've beaten it with like five characters.

1549
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Well, not really beaten it because it's more like a visual novel, but anyway.

1550
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
One of the games I've chosen has a character that is in Namco High.

1551
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I picked Genpei Touma Den, which we got it over here with one of the Namco Museum games as the Genji and Heike Clan.

1552
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:55,000
And over there, it was the Genji and Heike tale of the demon's demise.

1553
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
It's a side-scrolling action game that came out by Namco.

1554
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:04,000
It was an arcade game in 1986 and it ran on the Namco System 86 hardware.

1555
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And like I said, we got it over here as the Namco Museum Volume 4.

1556
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Or it was The Sea, which I have it.

1557
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
And the game is actually kind of a neat little game.

1558
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:22,000
And I like it from an artistic point of view because the game sort of plays like you're on a Yamatoe type landscape.

1559
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:33,000
So it looks almost like it's trying to emulate some of the ancient artwork of Japan pre the popularity of the woodblock stuff that a lot of people are used to.

1560
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:39,000
So as you go through the game, you have different types of action.

1561
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:47,000
You have the small mode, which is standard, big mode with large characters and big boss fights.

1562
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
And then you have a plane mode, which is overhead.

1563
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:58,000
You have a torii, which are used to transport you to a different stage.

1564
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
And most stages are featured in the side mode or plane mode.

1565
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
There are multiple torii that can be entered that will take to different routes on the map.

1566
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
In big mode, there's only one.

1567
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
And it's at the end of the stage.

1568
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:26,000
So you are playing a historical samurai named Taira no Kagekiyo, which is basically he died in the Battle of Dan no Ura at the end of the Genpei War.

1569
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And he was resurrected in this to fight Minamoto no Yoshitsune.

1570
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I've got a lot of Japanese in this.

1571
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And Saito Musashi Bo Benkei over the Imperial Regalia of Japan, which is the only way to beat Minamoto no Yoritomo.

1572
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:51,000
So it's got a lot of different elements of Japanese history and mythology in it, including the Sanzu River,

1573
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:59,000
which separates the current life from the afterlife, sort of like the river sticks in Greek mythology.

1574
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:09,000
And different mythological characters like Emo, or Emodio, who is the king of the god of the underworld, and Amaterasu, who is the sun goddess.

1575
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
There have been many different versions of it.

1576
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,000
In 1988, we had the Sharp X68000 home computer.

1577
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:21,000
And it was very, very much like the arcade version.

1578
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:26,000
We have a PC Engine version that came out on March 16th, 1990.

1579
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And the PC Engine version has been released on the Wii's Virtual Console.

1580
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:40,000
As I said earlier, it was released in the US on Namco Museum Volume 4 as the Genji and Heike clans.

1581
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Which is probably about the closest, I'd say, translation to the name that we could have gotten over here.

1582
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:56,000
There also was an interactive board game that was based off this that used a Famicom cartridge for play.

1583
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Sounds weird.

1584
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
It was called Genpei Tomiden Computer Board Game.

1585
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
It's not like the Pac-Man board game?

1586
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I have no freaking clue. I'd have to find this. I'd really like to see it.

1587
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:15,000
There was also a sequel called Genpei Tomiden Kan no Ki that came out April 7th, 1992, exclusively for the PC Engine.

1588
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:20,000
But it did have an American release that was called Samurai Ghost for TurboGrafx-16.

1589
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And it is the only one of the games that had been released outside Japan before Namco Museum Volume 4.

1590
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Kagekiyo has shown up in other games done by Namco.

1591
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
He was a playable character in the WonderSwan color game Namco Super Wars.

1592
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:44,000
And in Namco Cross-Capcom, which he teamed up with Mitsurugi from the Souls series and Tarosuke from Shadowland.

1593
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And some of the other characters have appeared in it.

1594
01:46:48,000 --> 01:47:00,000
And our most recent one was, of course, Tyra has been in Namco High as one of the dateable characters, which I'm probably going to play him next.

1595
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,000
And some of the game music was actually remixed for Ridge Racer 5.

1596
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Oh cool.

1597
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
So there you go.

1598
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And it's a fun game. I mean, you're watching it right now.

1599
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
And you see the shape of the clouds.

1600
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
That was the biggest thing that indicated that art style to me.

1601
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
And then when I went and found it actually confirmed, I was like, yes, I recognize art style.

1602
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I got to be honest, I have never seen this game before. Never.

1603
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
And I know it was in some Namco collections. I do not remember it at all.

1604
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Well, if you would like at some point, I'm more than happy to bring over the sea from my Namco collection.

1605
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
It's a fun game. It really is fun.

1606
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Well, I just have a billion other classics I got to play to.

1607
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
It's a very interesting platformer.

1608
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,000
A lot of the imagery in this has reminded me of an old arcade game called Sengoku that I played a handful of times.

1609
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:52,000
But I think that's just because Japanese classic warrior mythology.

1610
01:47:52,000 --> 01:48:09,000
And especially with the way that the imagery is presented, the way that you have, even the dialogue is presented in game as corner top to bottom, left to right.

1611
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:16,000
As traditional Japanese artwork would have had a poem or something written on it.

1612
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Very Kanji heavy too, I noticed.

1613
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:27,000
So, of course, the first one I played was the English version that came out on PlayStation.

1614
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:32,000
But it's a good game. It's a really good game. Very solid.

1615
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:39,000
And I also just laughed my ass off at any of Tyra's scenes that I've seen on Tumblr so far.

1616
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
So I have to play Tyra's next.

1617
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
All right. There it is. Your classic game of the week. What was the title one more time?

1618
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
It was... I just closed the window.

1619
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
You don't remember.

1620
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It was Genpei Tomiden.

1621
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Genpei Tomiden. There it is. All right. Your classic game of the week.

1622
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
And that's probably all of the correct pronunciation you're going to get out of me today.

1623
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,000
All right. We've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio coming up here on this pre-holiday edition of the show.

1624
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
We've got rapid fire news.

1625
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Special Fugu question of the week tonight.

1626
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Jason will be reading it. We'll get into that a little later.

1627
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And some news about Xbox One.

1628
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
And plenty more when we come back. Loki's still there on the phone, right?

1629
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Yes, I'm here.

1630
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I just have to check on you once in a while because I can't look at you.

1631
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Did they find your sister?

1632
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Not yet.

1633
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Oh, God.

1634
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Well, it's not... She was working out in, like, her goat pasture. So, who knows?

1635
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I don't want a goat.

1636
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
No, you don't.

1637
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Goats are cute.

1638
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
No, you don't.

1639
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
All right. Well, I hope everything's all right with that.

1640
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:44,000
So, we've got plenty more Loki on the phone and plenty more folks here in studio when we come back right after this break with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1641
01:49:44,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio, live on this Sunday evening, December the 22nd of 2013, with episode number 532 of our show in progress.

1642
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:08,000
And just in case we forget to mention it at the end of the show, I just want to wish all y'all happy holidays out there.

1643
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
No matter what it is you celebrate.

1644
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
You might already be done with the holidays like Jamie is.

1645
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Not technically done because I live in an interfaith family.

1646
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
That's true, as many people do in this day and age.

1647
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Yes.

1648
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:25,000
But whatever it is you celebrate, Christmas, I'm sure many, many, many of you, Festivus, Kwanzaa...

1649
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
And the blessed solstice since it just passed.

1650
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Solstice was last night, right?

1651
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Yep. Yule celebration.

1652
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Whatever it is y'all celebrate, have a good time.

1653
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
And, you know...

1654
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
And I still want a goat.

1655
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:47,000
And a thanks to all of you who have supported us, you know, through Here We Are, yet another holiday season together. So thank you, everybody.

1656
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
And trust me, you don't want a goat.

1657
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Thank you, Logan.

1658
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I do want a goat so we don't have to mow the lawn ever. And they're cute. Look at their eyes. Their eyes are adorable.

1659
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Hey, that was my thought. You know, our backyard's pretty overgrown. I'm like, hey, just bring him over. But yeah, it's not that easy.

1660
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:14,000
According to the in-laws, if you have one goat, it's fine. They sort of turn into, like, a dog-type pet. But if you have two goats, they turn into assholes. They start plotting against you.

1661
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:21,000
She has, like, six. And I think they had more. So I think it's, like, six or seven now that she has. It's ridiculous.

1662
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Goats! They're so cute.

1663
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
But your sister is a veterinarian, right? Or vet tech?

1664
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:38,000
She does lab work at a vet tech place, but she keeps her goats at, like, a friend of my mom's house. He has, like, farm land, and so she has, like, a pasture over there.

1665
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:50,000
That's pretty cool. You know, there's a lot of farming in my family, too, believe it or not. My uncle, I don't know how much I should really say about this, but my uncle is, like, a big-time pig farmer.

1666
01:51:50,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Like, big-time. Like, he was actually, like, president of some big pig-related thing when swine flu broke out. So they interviewed him on the news, and he was, like, literally there on the- I think I talked about this with swine flu first of all.

1667
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:11,000
He was literally the guy there on the news saying, don't call it swine flu, and you can eat as much bacon as you want. It's fine. You know, please don't stop buying bacon, because, you know, they're pig farmers.

1668
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,000
So, yeah, that's my uncle.

1669
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
All you have to say was just swine flu makes the bacon taste even better.

1670
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:30,000
That's the family I grew up in right there. And then I think my other uncle on my mom's side is, like, a rodeo guy, but I don't even- we're not super close.

1671
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:46,000
When I was a kid and used to go to Dothan, Alabama, and they had a little farm. We actually lived on the farm for, like, two years, so I spent two summers there, legit. But they had two goats, and they were both named Sam. Both of the goats were named Sam.

1672
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Some comments in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com. Fifth Dream reminding us it's Christmas Eve, Eve, Eve. That is something my sister used to say on the 23rd. She'd always say, it's Christmas Eve, Eve. So, today would be Christmas Eve, Eve, Eve.

1673
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Let's see, Retertainment in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, celebrate the holidays, including the new holiday, December 20th, the day gay marriage came to Utah. Congratulations, another state on marriage equality. That's amazing.

1674
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:23,000
And, as I told you earlier today, in the trying to pass a stay on it, the court rejected the stay. So, go get hitched.

1675
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Happy to hear it. If you're ready for it.

1676
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
If you want to.

1677
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
If you want to. Don't get hitched just because you can. That's like what Britney Spears does.

1678
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Yeah. However, it would be completely fair if you wanted to get really drunk and elope.

1679
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Yeah. Go to have a nice Utah wedding. There you go. All right. Well, congrats to Utah. Congrats to all the newlyweds, no matter what type of couple you're in these days.

1680
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Just happy to hear all this good news everywhere.

1681
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:59,000
All right. We're going to get into some good news and maybe some bad news with some gaming rapid fire topics here. Loki, start us off rapid fire news.

1682
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:09,000
All right. So, this week we got another update for Grand Theft Auto Online. They added some capture to flag type gameplay modes. Of course, with their own kind of spin to it.

1683
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:19,000
They have Raid, which is kind of like a standard capture to flag. Then they have, you know, bases that you can hold and packages you have to seize and stuff.

1684
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:29,000
And then also, content, which I guess is centered around a single vehicle that you capture and have to bring back to your base.

1685
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:39,000
So, fun stuff. And then of course, the content creator stuff came out last week as well. So, you know, been trying to make some stuff with that. That was kind of cool.

1686
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Dynasty Warriors 8 Extreme Legends coming to consoles, at least Sony consoles, in Spring 2014.

1687
01:54:50,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Of course, Extreme Legends for PlayStation 3 and Extreme Legends The Complete Edition for PlayStation 4 and Vita. So, all bases covered there.

1688
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And, oh yeah, one of the games I forgot to mention that I played this week, a tiny little bit of, of course, just a tiny little bit. Must stress that.

1689
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Cookie Clicker got a Christmas update. So, now there's reindeer cookies that you can click on and a crazy looking Cthulhu-esque Santa.

1690
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And all other sorts of power-ups and stuff you can get in there as well. Christmas tree ornaments and all that fun stuff.

1691
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:36,000
So, check it out if, you know, you've left your cookies clicking all by themselves for a while.

1692
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:44,000
And the knock-off on the iPhone Cookie Clicker also has Santa cookies right now. So, just saying.

1693
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:52,000
With special chocolate milk mode. So, if you're playing the cheap knock-off on iPhone, there's something for you there too. Just saying.

1694
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Yeah, orange juice right now as my milk.

1695
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I, there's, I don't know if you've played the iPhone knock-off one, but like there's milk that slowly rises that will increase your multiplier.

1696
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:11,000
So, that's why they have like the chocolate milk because it makes your multiplayer like 50 times and all this crazy stuff. So, that's pretty awesome.

1697
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Alright, well, moving on to some other topics. The game that I kind of thought NES Remakes might be more like, Super Mario Brothers Crossover, but it's not.

1698
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Super Mario Brothers Crossover has a brand new 3.1 version that is out. And this brings the lost levels into Super Mario Brothers Crossover.

1699
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:36,000
You know, like the Japanese Super Mario Brothers 2 lost levels. So, yeah, now lost levels will have 52 levels there with it.

1700
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:44,000
348 levels in the game now. They did not change the physics, however, for Mario and Luigi, so it's not necessarily the true version.

1701
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:53,000
But, eh, there you go. Whole lots of new levels there for Super Mario Brothers Crossover 3.1. I haven't played this game in a while, but it was a lot of fun the times I did check it out.

1702
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And I think, wasn't that developed here locally? Didn't we find that out? Like the guy who did it in Sacramento?

1703
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Yeah, he is.

1704
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
We gotta find him and get him on the show.

1705
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Also, Konami releasing a new version of Contra. But guess what? It's only in China. At least it is for now. I don't know.

1706
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
But, yeah, Contra Evolution is available in China. It's something for Google, Android or iOS.

1707
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Konami, excuse me, I think you get this free here on those systems, but in China it's like a full release as opposed to a little version here.

1708
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I don't know. I haven't checked this game out on iOS, but it's there and it's just the classic Contra game that you had on either the arcade or the NES, but the graphics are a little bit more improved there.

1709
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:44,000
But, yeah, you probably won't do very well with it if it's Contra on a tablet, but hey, you can at least check that out.

1710
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Yeah, as I say that video, they have the Contra Evolution Revolution or whatever that's got PC and Arcade listed on there. I was like, oh hey, PC game? That'd be pretty cool.

1711
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Maybe coming soon to Steam for $1.99.

1712
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Yeah.

1713
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Speaking of Steam and things you can buy on it, Typing of the Dead Overkill is half off on Steam, or at least it was during the holiday sale. I don't know if that's still going.

1714
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:17,000
But there's also a brand new DLC pack. You know they've been releasing a lot of these and we keep covering it every week. I don't know. This might be the last one.

1715
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:30,000
But we have to mention this one because this Trump, they had Shakespeare, they had Football Manager, but this one, this is the best, you guys. It's the Filth DLC pack.

1716
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:39,000
You can now type lines like man meat, furious penis, studded cock ring, always were a cunning linguist.

1717
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:50,000
So you can put in those terms into Typing of the Dead Overkill as you blast zombies to cocks. So check that out.

1718
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,000
That might sell the game for me because I like, um, yeah.

1719
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
This means we need, you like cocks? Is that what you're saying?

1720
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Not really.

1721
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:09,000
We need to do another Let's Play with extra for narrating. I think that's going to have to be a thing there. So we'll get that. Maybe instead of Horde House this week we'll have extra for narrating the Filthy Pack.

1722
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
This would be a cunning linguist.

1723
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Yeah, it looks like right now it's only $14.99 and then the DLC is $2.99. So it's only 25% off.

1724
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Wait for it to come down to $9.99. It'll come down to $9.99. Wait for it.

1725
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Alright, Dark Sakura.

1726
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Well this doesn't really have anything to do with cock. Maybe lots of vagina.

1727
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Skullgirls Encore has a Typing of the Skullgirls mode. Totally inspired by the Typing of the Dead.

1728
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:51,000
You will type an onscreen word to do your super attacks. If you type it correctly your attack will do 1.5 more damage than usual.

1729
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:57,000
If right but not perfect it's regular damage and incorrect will have a 10% reduction on the damage.

1730
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,000
It doesn't work online or in tournament mode. So Typing of the Skullgirls.

1731
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Also for anyone who loves to play old Playstation games on your mobile you can now play the original Tomb Raider and it's $9.99.

1732
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:17,000
And it is compatible with iOS 7.0 later only for iOS.

1733
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:24,000
You know what, I would only care if I could play the second one where I could make her explode or break her neck.

1734
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:30,000
And then last but not least, and this is really just more good that the video game community is doing.

1735
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Microsoft has been putting it out there for the zoo tycoon community to actually do something to raise money for endangered species.

1736
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Each month Microsoft is launching a zoo tycoon community challenge to help raise money to help these animals.

1737
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:52,000
And when the challenge's goal has been reached Microsoft will donate $10,000 to the chosen non-profit.

1738
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Players will get updates on how the money is spent with reports from Microsoft.

1739
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:05,000
So like December 31st this one was released 1000 rhinos into the wild in zoo tycoon and they will donate $10,000.

1740
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Adopt 1000 Komodo dragons in zoo tycoon and another $10,000.

1741
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Release 1000 Sumatran tigers and that's what they are.

1742
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:19,000
So hey, you know, they're doing something good. Kudos to them.

1743
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
We like to hear about gamers doing good.

1744
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
We like the fuzzy animals.

1745
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Gaming companies getting people involved and everything.

1746
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
I like Komodo dragons.

1747
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Good stuff.

1748
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Red Entertainment says let's play Cocks.

1749
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
He's talking about chickens of course.

1750
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Alright, let's get into a segment we do here on OLR called the Foogle Question of the Week.

1751
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Wait, wrong music.

1752
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
180, pull back.

1753
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
There we go.

1754
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Foogle Question of the Week.

1755
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Alright, every week we ask a question on our Facebook communities.

1756
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus community at Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1757
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Until they, you know, pull our page because they think it's not really us or something.

1758
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:10,000
But anyway, we actually flipped the script a little bit this week because it has been a really slow news week.

1759
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
And I guess we could have asked about the YouTube.

1760
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I guess we could have asked about something else.

1761
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,000
But you know what?

1762
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:22,000
It seemed like a great excuse for us to do another installment of a segment here on OLR we haven't done in an awfully long time.

1763
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:25,000
It's a special holiday edition of Ask Orange Lounge.

1764
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
For real this time.

1765
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1766
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Well, will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1767
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
We pulled Facebook and Google and thank God we're still on Google.

1768
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
But we might not be much longer if they keep up this fuckery.

1769
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Alright.

1770
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Good times Will.

1771
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I should honest to God be on Whose Line Is It Anyway?

1772
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Because I make that shit up on the spot, right?

1773
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I miss my calling.

1774
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Wayne Brady.

1775
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Get down with Aisha.

1776
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
I'm coming for you.

1777
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Alright.

1778
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
It's not Wayne Brady.

1779
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
It's like, well.

1780
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Wayne Brady's one of the stars.

1781
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Alright, anyway.

1782
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Jason is going to be fielding our FUGL questions this week.

1783
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Because some of our listeners are asking us questions.

1784
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Are we doing every question tonight?

1785
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Or are you just picking some of your favorites?

1786
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I'll jump around a little bit and see how many we go for time.

1787
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Pick your favorites.

1788
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Yeah, for time purposes.

1789
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Don't drag this out too long.

1790
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Tech 2030 starts us off with a ringer.

1791
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Alright.

1792
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Nothing off limits.

1793
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Okay, I'm gonna get crazy with this one.

1794
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Alright.

1795
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
What's your favorite color?

1796
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
My favorite color is dark green.

1797
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Sometimes dark purple.

1798
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Depending on my mood.

1799
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Black.

1800
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Because it depends on your version of color theory.

1801
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
It's either all of the colors or none of the colors.

1802
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Loki.

1803
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Sadly enough, because of this show, I did a lot of orange stuff.

1804
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
So, orange.

1805
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
There you go.

1806
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I almost bought an orange bike.

1807
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:55,000
You know, I always find it, like, one of our super fans who is really wonderful.

1808
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Misty.

1809
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
If she's out there, I don't see her in chat.

1810
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
She might be, she's probably on a train somewhere.

1811
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
But, hi Misty, if you're out there listening, I always love that she'll see something orange

1812
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
and she'll, like, text me a picture of it or something.

1813
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
She's like, I had to buy it.

1814
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
I just think it's great.

1815
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Anyway.

1816
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
So, yeah.

1817
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Your favorite color should be orange, Tech 2030.

1818
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
But if not, then, you know, green, black.

1819
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Alright.

1820
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
What about my answer?

1821
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Okay, Jason, what's your answer?

1822
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
What about your answer?

1823
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:25,000
You know, without going too crazy with it, what's funny is that I actually don't really have a favorite color anymore.

1824
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Growing up, it was green.

1825
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
It kind of started to change to blue in the last couple of years.

1826
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I don't really identify a favorite color anymore.

1827
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
It's kind of weird.

1828
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:37,000
But green was the biggest portion of my youth for an incredibly long time.

1829
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Do you know I had green hair once?

1830
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I do not think I've seen pictures, so I will go with you.

1831
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I was in college in Alabama.

1832
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Definitely did not see pictures.

1833
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,000
So I was probably about 20 years old and had the top.

1834
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,000
You know how people now are, like, doing their hair two different colors?

1835
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Not the ombre thing, but the underside one color.

1836
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
The underside stayed brown.

1837
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
The top was forest green, manic panic, which I don't even think you can get that color anymore.

1838
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Fifth Dream.

1839
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I love this comment at the chat room at live.vaudeville.com.

1840
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Fifth Dream says, let me answer.

1841
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Let me answer.

1842
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
I have no answer.

1843
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
That's what Jason just did.

1844
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
But, Jason, I was going to say this.

1845
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Don't you have, you say you may not have particularly a favorite color, but don't you, like, when you go shopping for clothes or something, you're kind of, like, drawn to one color.

1846
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Like, my friends make fun of me because a lot of my wardrobe is, like, all earth colors, like, brown and, like, I really, and it's kind of true.

1847
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Like, I wear a lot of brown and green.

1848
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
I wear a lot of brown and black.

1849
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I wear earth colors.

1850
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I don't go shopping for clothes.

1851
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I buy funny t-shirts off the internet.

1852
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
That's just a lot.

1853
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I go shopping for jeans and that's about it.

1854
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:44,000
I do go thrifting pretty regularly and if I'm going to look for something to modify, I tend to look for colors that aren't going to be completely outdated in five years.

1855
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Alright.

1856
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:50,000
My favorite color will be whatever color shoes I wind up getting because I really do need to go shopping.

1857
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I'm just going on way too long for a freaking color.

1858
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Ask another question.

1859
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Another question.

1860
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:01,000
P.J. would like to ask, biggest let down title or game related news of the year?

1861
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Biggest let down title or game related news of the year.

1862
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Oh, I'd really have to look at, like, some of the stories from this year to remember.

1863
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I know what let me down.

1864
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Sorry.

1865
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Go for it.

1866
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:19,000
When my Mass Effect 3 data pad stopped working so I couldn't stay at 100%.

1867
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
True.

1868
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
True story.

1869
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Because I still, I just uninstalled that thing after having it on my phone for a year.

1870
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Loki, can you think of anything, a big disappointment or a big gaming news disappointment for this year?

1871
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Saints Row IV.

1872
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Ooh.

1873
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Why did I know he was going to go there?

1874
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
I just knew he was going to go there.

1875
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I have to stew on this one a little longer.

1876
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I can't think of anything off the top of my head.

1877
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Maybe, I intended to go through for the easy answer and say Xbox's original policies.

1878
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:56,000
But, you know, to be fair, they did change it and everything's cool now and the new consoles are doing just fine.

1879
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
So, I can't really hate on that too much.

1880
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Maybe the biggest, I'm going to say this.

1881
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:08,000
The biggest disappointment for me this year is third party publishers openly pooping on the Wii U.

1882
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,000
EA's attitude towards the Wii U is my biggest disappointment this year.

1883
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I think that would be my honest to god answer.

1884
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
That's a good answer.

1885
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I honestly don't have an answer to that question just because my involvement, lack of, precludes me from that this year.

1886
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Not in the new consoles.

1887
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Get up to speed.

1888
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
You've got the controllers though, you've got the controllers.

1889
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Yes, I'm contributing in other ways right now.

1890
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Another question!

1891
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Another question!

1892
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I'm getting there.

1893
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:41,000
SSJ100mat says, if there were a VoG slash OLRCon, who would you want as the keynote speaker?

1894
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Ooh.

1895
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Me.

1896
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
No.

1897
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I would want, I would want Jason Enos to be one of the speakers.

1898
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Yeah, I miss him.

1899
02:07:54,000 --> 02:08:00,000
I don't know if necessarily the keynote, but I just think as far, you know, we have a lot, as far as DDR Community,

1900
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:05,000
which remember, this show started as a music game community show, which was in large part to DDR,

1901
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I think we directly have Jason to thank for that kind of happening in the US in the first place.

1902
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:15,000
So I sort of think we owe that debt, if nothing else, to him.

1903
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:20,000
So I would hope if there is a con, we can convince him to come say hello.

1904
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Keynote speaker?

1905
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I want the guy that plays Seika to Sanshiro to be our keynote speaker and to do it in character.

1906
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Um, I want Sid Meier to come give the keynote because I'm a horror for civilization and covert action and many of the things he's done.

1907
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Stop rolling your eyes, Dark Sakura, stop it!

1908
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I wasn't rolling my eyes, I was looking up.

1909
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Uh, Loki, you have an answer?

1910
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Um, I have no idea.

1911
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Um, the president of Pinkberry.

1912
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Yeah!

1913
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Wait, not the co, not the co-founder guy that got arrested for all that fucked up stuff, or got Togori, he did some really fucked up stuff.

1914
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Not him, not him.

1915
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Not him.

1916
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Alright, not him.

1917
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Alright, uh, Jason, I don't know if you have an answer, but if not, another question.

1918
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Uh, me? I'm the voice.

1919
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Yeah, actually, Jason would be the voice that would announce all the speakers.

1920
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I would definitely introduce the keynote speaker, how's that?

1921
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Oh, sorry, Redertainment says a keynote address from Rob's mom. I think Bobby Blackwolf should give a speech.

1922
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Yes, Bobby.

1923
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Shouldn't, if there's gonna be a keynote speaker, shouldn't Bobby Blackwolf open OLRCon?

1924
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Hell yes.

1925
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
With commentary by your mom.

1926
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Alright.

1927
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Rob, who's that guy up there?

1928
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
There's the definitive answer, Bobby and my mother.

1929
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Alright.

1930
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
And Travis Donovan, too, to be fair.

1931
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Alright.

1932
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Because the name came up, Hunter R. would like to ask,

1933
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Dearest Orange Lounge, is Pinkberry one of those make-your-own-frozen-yogurt places?

1934
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
It's even better.

1935
02:09:53,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Better flavor, you don't make it your own, it's kind of traditional, like Baskin-Robbins, behind-the-counter style,

1936
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
but the ingredients are delectable.

1937
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Fresh, and good, and beautiful.

1938
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:10,000
And they're not paying us, so I hate that we keep giving them free advertising, but it is really good.

1939
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
But they friended us both on Twitter.

1940
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Oh, did they?

1941
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Yeah.

1942
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Their base flavor is more tart than your standard yogurt, it's not vanilla, so it's more Greek yogurt style,

1943
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:26,000
and I know that might sound a little weird, but trust me, the frozen yogurt is like real fucking good.

1944
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:35,000
However, their chocolate is one of the lowest sugar soft-serve yogurts that you can get from anywhere.

1945
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Yeah, and it is pretty low calorie, unless you get like peanut butter or something.

1946
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And you can get a mini size, which is perfect.

1947
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Or you can get it in a cone, if you're feeling like having a fat day, like I do a lot.

1948
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:50,000
All right, if there's nothing else to add to that, then another question.

1949
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Did we get Loki's answer?

1950
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
On what makes Pinkberry different? I don't think there's much you can add to that.

1951
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Fair enough, yeah, good point.

1952
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:02,000
We will then end with the one that I completely lost sight of, and it's in here somewhere.

1953
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Fifth Dream asks, what is the one game each of the host things has been too ignored and should be played by everyone?

1954
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,000
In other words, is there a little known game you would force everyone to play if you could?

1955
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Oh shit.

1956
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I have really picked the winners.

1957
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,000
These are questions I wanted more warning on.

1958
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,000
One game I would make everybody play if I could.

1959
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Looking at the shelf of games over there.

1960
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
I'm not in my vault, so I really can't say.

1961
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I'll go for the easy cop-out answer, but it's so true, because I need people to understand why we love the Guardian legend.

1962
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Yes, well that was what I was going to say, but I knew you'd pick it too.

1963
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Sure, sure. Loki, is there a game you'd make every- oh wait, no, I'll wait.

1964
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
It's coming to me. It has four letters.

1965
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
It starts with grand and ends with five.

1966
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
It's little known.

1967
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:01,000
It's not little known, and no, I would say Earth Defense Forest.

1968
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
That's what I was thinking.

1969
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Or Excite Truck.

1970
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Oh yes, Excite Truck.

1971
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
It's actually a very worthy answer.

1972
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Some folks in chat were entertainment saying Mass Effect.

1973
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
But it's not little known.

1974
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Yeah, that would be Shane's answer anyway.

1975
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Shane's not here, so fuck it.

1976
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Katamari sprang to mind for me pretty much immediately, but I think that's just above the cusp of little known.

1977
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
It had a pretty reasonable bout of success.

1978
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Believe it or not, if you think about it, we probably have some 17 and 18 year olds that listen to this show that were probably kind of young when that game first came out.

1979
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
They might have missed it.

1980
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
We're getting older by the year.

1981
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I rather think that I would have said Fantasy Zone, because it is one of my favorite little shooter games of all time.

1982
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
It is my second favorite video game.

1983
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:55,000
But it is fairly well known in the classic gaming community.

1984
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:59,000
It's a big SEGA title. It's been out forever.

1985
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:05,000
So I am going to go with Fantasy Zone.

1986
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:09,000
There is a part of me that wants to go super duper old school and say everybody.

1987
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Some of y'all missed the Atari 2600.

1988
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Kangaroo!

1989
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:19,000
You all need to experience the frustration but yet awesome that comes with playing Sword Quest.

1990
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Any of them.

1991
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Airworld didn't come out here. What was the first one that came out?

1992
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
I think Earthworld was the first?

1993
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
They all kind of blurred together for me.

1994
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
That first Sword Quest game?

1995
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:37,000
I will tell you, as far as old school Game Boy games that not many people would think of, Revenge of the Gator.

1996
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Oh yeah, I love Revenge of the Gator.

1997
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
That was a good game.

1998
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
I actually would say Mother 3.

1999
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:49,000
I definitely think Earthbound was little known.

2000
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
And playing the whole series is worth it.

2001
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
But Mother 3 is a fantastic game.

2002
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:01,000
I've actually not finished it myself but I've seen the entirety of the game beginning to end.

2003
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
That game is just straight up fun.

2004
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,000
It's battle system has the charm of Mario RPG.

2005
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Great writing, great music.

2006
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:14,000
The story is a bit against the grain, against the cuff.

2007
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
It's quite fun.

2008
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Seek out this game if you even know what Earthbound is.

2009
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Obviously it's technically Earthbound 2.

2010
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
It's the same in the storyline.

2011
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Wait, hold on. Before we wrap, I just wanted to say I had to look it up and it was Earthworld.

2012
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,000
It was going to bug me. Sword Quest Earthworld was the first one and Fireworld was out too.

2013
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Wasn't that the one where they had the contest?

2014
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Where you would win all of this stuff but they never finished the series?

2015
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,000
And just for the old school O.L.R. people, I also have to throw out there Burger Time.

2016
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
You have to play Burger Time.

2017
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I would agree with that. That was a fun, silly classic.

2018
02:14:50,000 --> 02:15:02,000
The hotel that I usually stay at in San Francisco has a little set top arcade, flat top arcade, multi-main type thing.

2019
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:07,000
And I always plop down and play Burger Time on it if I'm not doing anything else.

2020
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:18,000
We will end with William Murderface asking which game releases are all of you looking forward to in 2014?

2021
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,000
What is the first big thing on your radar for 2014?

2022
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Whatever the next Mass Effect is. Because I kind of really don't care about much else.

2023
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Not exactly a core game but something related to it?

2024
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:37,000
It's outside the trilogy story. It's like a new thing.

2025
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:45,000
And I love the universe so much that there's still this hopeful little spark inside of me that hasn't been completely stomped on by the writing team.

2026
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:51,000
That hopes that there might be something a little bit less human centric out.

2027
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I'm keeping my fingers crossed. If I'm going to be disappointed, let me be disappointed. Let me be heartbroken.

2028
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:01,000
But I still want to see what it is.

2029
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Believe it or not, Destiny, which might surprise you because I don't usually talk about first person shooters, but I'm really excited to check that game out.

2030
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:19,000
And I'm hoping Nintendo gets Smash Brothers out this next year because I'm really looking forward to that as well.

2031
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Loki, what are you most looking forward to in 2014?

2032
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,000
I want to check out No Man's Sky because that looks pretty sweet.

2033
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:33,000
And then, I don't know. There's not a whole ton I'm actually looking forward to so far.

2034
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:39,000
It would be nice if Sunset Overdrive came out because that looked like a really interesting trailer.

2035
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:44,000
But then again, so did Fuse, I think.

2036
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:50,000
The one by Insomniac that ended up sucking, so I don't know.

2037
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:56,000
We'll have to see. I think there's just going to be a lot of stuff that we haven't seen announced yet that's going to be pretty good.

2038
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I'm hoping too that there'll be something announced at E3 that we just don't know of yet.

2039
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:04,000
And I think that is also my answer.

2040
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
You wanted me to ask you the Rupaul's Drag Race question, didn't you?

2041
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
There's a Drag Race question?

2042
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Locopoco asks, who are you rooting for in Season 6?

2043
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:19,000
So far, just based off the videos themselves and nothing else, I think Ben De La Creme is my favorite.

2044
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:22,000
His picks were Kelly Mantel and Courtney Act.

2045
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:28,000
I think Colton the Act is almost a sure win for the top three.

2046
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:34,000
By the way, Courtney Act is Australian, so her name is really Colton the Act.

2047
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,000
You've got to love that. Come on, that's a great drag name.

2048
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I think she's too good for the show. I know that sounds really horrible, but she's huge in Australia already.

2049
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
It's just kind of weird, I don't know.

2050
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I think Kelly Mantel, even though she had her own logo special a couple years ago and also might be too big for the show,

2051
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I think she's going to do very well too, but I like Ben De La Creme based off the videos.

2052
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:01,000
That concludes Orange Drag Radio. Thank you all for your questions.

2053
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:06,000
For those of you that actually know, if you actually know what the Reading is Fundamental podcast is,

2054
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:11,000
there might be like two people out there listening, that is going to come back this next year, so I'll say that much.

2055
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Google it or look it up on iTunes.

2056
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,000
All right, let's move on. We've got more gaming news to get to. Loki.

2057
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:28,000
All right, so the first set of indie games coming to Xbox One are going to be hitting March 2014.

2058
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:35,000
This is part of that ID at Xbox program that they have there.

2059
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:42,000
This includes stuff from Halfbrick Studios, Double Fine, Crytek, and Vladimir.

2060
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:48,000
So that's nice that they're finally going to start having some decent indie games on there.

2061
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Anything in particular that you personally are looking forward to?

2062
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Not really, because I haven't really seen, I think a lot of it's just going to be ports of stuff that we're seeing already are coming to the PlayStation 4 and stuff.

2063
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:11,000
I haven't really heard of any standout indie games, aside from, even though I've purchased it on pretty much every platform,

2064
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Minecraft would be interesting to see what they do with Minecraft on the next-gen platforms.

2065
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:22,000
All right. Yeah, I'm curious to see how Minecraft is on the next-gen platforms, too.

2066
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I'm thinking it'll be unlimited-sized worlds again, like it is on PC.

2067
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:31,000
It'll just be more like PC, but with some of the console enhancements. I think that'll be pretty cool.

2068
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:41,000
All right. Well, there was a Killer Instinct tournament that happened, and it caused a lot of news to spread around the internet about Wildfire, about the Xbox One, and some DRM checks.

2069
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Because everybody's like, did the DRM magically come back to the Xbox One?

2070
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Because what happened is there was actually this clip going on of a Killer Instinct tournament.

2071
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:59,000
And what happens partway through this tournament is that the Xbox One comes up to the dashboard and says, do you own this gamer app?

2072
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:03,000
If you have the disc, insert it now. If there's no disc, make sure you're signed into Xbox Live.

2073
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
If you don't have the rights for playing it, you'll need to buy it at the Xbox Store.

2074
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
So everybody was like, oh my God, the Xbox One's doing check-ins, and da-da-da-da-da.

2075
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Well now, Bobby talked about this on his show a little bit tonight as well, and kind of gave some insight to this, so I'm going to just totally bite off what he said.

2076
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:26,000
But basically, it wasn't that the Xbox was necessarily doing an online check-in, because if you think about it, I mean, logically, think about it.

2077
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:32,000
It would have already been connected once in the past 24 hours. Why would it suddenly disconnect during the tournament?

2078
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:38,000
The problem was that somebody was playing the game on a system that wasn't theirs. They were playing it on a different system.

2079
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:47,000
And if you think about it, Xbox and even PlayStation kind of already do that today, so this isn't necessarily something new.

2080
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,000
It just happened in the middle of the game.

2081
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Now, not that I'm necessarily defending what's happening here, because that is really weird that it would have allowed the game to launch in the first place,

2082
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:02,000
and that it stops the game in progress or what have you. That's a little bit weird.

2083
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:09,000
And that there ought to be a little bit of give when you're going to go over to friends' houses and play games or do these tournaments or what have you.

2084
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:18,000
But, you know, if you're going to play these games, make sure they're on the Xbox you bought them on, or these things might happen.

2085
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:24,000
You can't just go around and take your digital game and download it on all these other different consoles. It isn't going to work that way.

2086
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,000
It doesn't work that way on the 360.

2087
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Bobby Blackwolf chimes in and says their 4G dropped. That's what happened.

2088
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,000
So it was, you know, checking on the internet, checking on the internet, and then it dropped.

2089
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:42,000
This happens on my 360 games today, actually, because I had to get my console replaced because of the red ring.

2090
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:51,000
And even though I transferred my licenses, for some reason, whenever I play an older game, like I go into Geometry Wars, let's say, that was like the first arcade game I bought on Xbox 360.

2091
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I go into Geometry Wars, I see the demo title screen for like two seconds, and then all of a sudden it flips to the retail screen.

2092
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Because what it's doing, it's checking the internet, making sure I really own it, and then it will update my demo copy of the game with,

2093
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Oh, Green Sky's trying to play it. He bought the game. Here it is.

2094
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,000
So this already happens on the 360. It's just kind of weird.

2095
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:21,000
And Bobby's telling me that the reason why it's still checking is that if I do the license transfer, you still have to delete and redownload the game.

2096
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Good lord. It's a lot of games, Bobby. It's like 50 games. I'd rather just be online, honestly.

2097
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:32,000
And how often am I playing my old 360 games anymore? Once every few months. That's it.

2098
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:42,000
So just bottom line, keep the digital rights rules in the back of your head, because it's going to be the same on 360 and these systems.

2099
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:50,000
And no, they did not suddenly insert in all these rules that they explicitly said they weren't going to do.

2100
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:59,000
So be careful in jumping to conclusions. Gaming journalists, I'm watching you face.

2101
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:04,000
All right. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? I've been having a discussion about aliens.

2102
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Really? Yes. Are they real? No.

2103
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:17,000
So I brought up Namco. Hi. You're wrong. I think you're wrong. There's aliens. We just don't know them yet.

2104
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Star Trek is real. No, but I guarantee you, if they showed up, we'd try to fuck them.

2105
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:32,000
What? If fandom is to be believed, somebody would ship them in 30 seconds. Real.

2106
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Anything can be shipped. I know. Trust me. I know. Especially the ship from Galaga.

2107
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:44,000
How's that for transition? Yeah. Namco. Hi. I've been playing it and it's fucking weird.

2108
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I it's a dating sim. It's more like a visual novel, really less, you know, a dating sim.

2109
02:23:51,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Although if you really want to just romance somebody, all you have to do is pick them and only them and do all of their scenes and you're guaranteed cute little romances.

2110
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:13,000
But you have certain characters that you can romance, like Mr. Driller or Lolo from Klonoa or the Galaga ship, who is awesome.

2111
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Galaga refers to Galaga in the third person. Galaga is amazing. Galaga says greetings, humans.

2112
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Of course, when I played it, I got the deluxe set. You can unlock the characters for $1.95 individually if you want to get past the.

2113
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:41,000
And you know, I wouldn't want to fucking a sorry. Yeah. I mean, I was trying to talk about Homestuck.

2114
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:47,000
I mean, Namco. Hi. Stuck. So anyway, you start off the game.

2115
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:57,000
You can you know, you've got all of your Namco characters. You can also pay for premium characters for $1.95 a pop, $4.95 in sets of three or $14.95 for the whole set,

2116
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:04,000
which is actually what I did. And I got like the soundtrack and because I did the preorder thing.

2117
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:10,000
So I have 18 dateable characters. And like I said, I mentioned Homestuck. There are three Homestuck characters in it.

2118
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:17,000
You have Terezi, who I dated first because she's awesome. And then you have Dave Sprite, who made me sad.

2119
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:27,000
And James, who was freaking weird. And then after that, I think the next one I did was.

2120
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Donko, the drum from Taiko No Tatsujin, who starts off on her cell phone in detention.

2121
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:41,000
She's like the total valley girl type character. And then I did Richard Miller from Time Crisis, who was kind of weird.

2122
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Everyone's really just bizarre in this game, but they're all bizarre in an incredibly entertaining way.

2123
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:54,000
And like Pac-Man comes out and gives you advice. But the advice is always be true to yourself.

2124
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Although sometimes the advice is maybe you shouldn't be true to yourself. And like the principal is Dig Dug.

2125
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:08,000
And the the detention teacher is King from Tekken. And the only sound he ever makes is a roar.

2126
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:13,000
And then he yells at you. It's it's really out there and super funny.

2127
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:20,000
And I think the whole thing was well done. And, you know, and for a lot of these games, there's people who may not get all the games.

2128
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:29,000
You know, these characters came from, like Albatross and Hitomi and Amazonia.

2129
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:35,000
And yes, Fifth Dream posted a picture of Galaga talking to the cousin.

2130
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:42,000
You play the cousin of the prince of all cosmos who gets thrown in detention because he rolled up the school into a giant katamari.

2131
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:48,000
It's it's just funny. You have to like fight evil Namco high at one point. And they're all robots.

2132
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:51,000
And so I didn't realize this game was actually already out.

2133
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Yeah, it's an HTML five game, which the HTML five was done by a group called Date Naito.

2134
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:04,000
And I've actually emailed them to ask them what their licensing costs are for their engine, because I'm trying to do a web comic in Flash.

2135
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:11,000
But I would like to be able to do a visual novel style and have it be accessible for people on iOS.

2136
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:18,000
So, but yeah, it's it's it's cute. And if anybody wants to see other screen caps from it, you can go to my Tumblr.

2137
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Kurotobasa.tumblr.com. I might repost some stuff on the OLR Tumblr.

2138
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:30,000
So, all right. It's it's fucking Namco dating sim. Good times.

2139
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:36,000
We're well, it's we're sort of sort of dating sim, but really more visual novel.

2140
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:40,000
All right. A good waste of time. Yeah. Waste of time in a good way.

2141
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:49,000
I can sit there for like 30 minutes ago. Oh, and usually actually only takes me that long because I'm doing screen caps because I'm like, what the fuck did they just say?

2142
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:54,000
All right. Moving on. Loki, I don't know if your story's on a dating sim, but.

2143
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:09,000
No, thank goodness. No, I was talking about the steam machine teardowns, because, you know, just recently the 300 people that made it into the hardware beta received their prototype steam machines.

2144
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:17,000
And of course, you know, iFixit somehow got one as part of their teardown pages that they do.

2145
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:23,000
And they found out that there's a ton of expensive stuff in there, including a Nvidia GTX 780.

2146
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Also a Core i5 4570 running at 3.6 gigahertz and pricing everything out.

2147
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:37,000
It looks like that that machine runs roughly about $1300.

2148
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:45,000
So a pretty powerful little PC. I want one. Yeah, me too.

2149
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:53,000
They're going to sell a $1500 TV connected device.

2150
02:28:53,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I just. That does seem. I just don't know who the audience is for those high end machines.

2151
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I think the low end ones have more potential to do more business, but I don't know games.

2152
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Not necessarily. Some of the steam games don't take much, especially the indie stuff.

2153
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:18,000
I just this whole thing. Every time I hear like I'm I'm really, really into it.

2154
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:24,000
I mentioned in the intro last week that SteamOS was out for hobbyists and system builders. I'm looking forward to it.

2155
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I'm going to dip my toes in and see if there's something that I can do with it and see what they come up with.

2156
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I'm very interested in this, but the hardware portion of it, sans the controller, doesn't make a lick of sense to me.

2157
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:52,000
We don't plug computers into our TVs. The people that actually plug computers into their TVs are incredibly few in the in the in the larger, you know, in the in the larger community.

2158
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:59,000
The things that get plugged into TVs are small, tiny little crap.

2159
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I've completely forgotten the word home entertainment system, you know, demographics.

2160
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:10,000
And I just yeah, I just I'm insanely interested at the same time.

2161
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:16,000
I don't understand it. And it's it's going to be a very interesting 2014 for Valve.

2162
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:40,000
But that's about all I can say. Well, I'm more interested in kind of the front end, how everything's going to work, because mainly, you know, I would love to have I mean, I'm not necessarily going to buy a thirteen hundred dollar PC, but I'd like to be able to build a PC and have kind of that front end experience that you get with like a console nowadays with, you know, the integration with Netflix and the different apps and stuff that you can put on there and, you know, and have it work.

2163
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Pretty seamless would be nice, you know, like Steam big picture mode works great. It would be nice if there is non gaming apps.

2164
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:56,000
I mean, I know they sell software and stuff. I'm talking about like, you know, Skype and Netflix, Hulu, that kind of stuff.

2165
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Yeah. Yeah. And like I was talking about with the PS4 controller, I'm very close to turning Steam on to big picture mode by default so that I can just grab my controller, you know, turn it on because it's Bluetooth paired and go to it.

2166
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:19,000
It's a nice interface and there's going to be a lot of benefits to it. It's just the machine itself that confounds me.

2167
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:23,000
All right. Jason, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

2168
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:27,000
That's right. Well, wait, let me let me sorry. Let me read a quick comment from a chat. Sorry.

2169
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:34,000
actdeftatlive.vognetwork.com says, Remember, people, the beta build of the Steam machine is exclusive to the beta and it's not one model of the Steam machine.

2170
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Well, yeah, we mentioned that's a high end system and that, you know, there's low end systems as well. And maybe that's more of the audience for it.

2171
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:46,000
But it's going to be interesting to see how these things, you know, do put up against the console.

2172
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:56,000
They can't bring down those costs that much. And I mean, well, you know, you may spend more on the front end buying the console, but you can't argue those deals, man.

2173
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,000
We'll see. This is very true. All right. Now we'll move on. Jason. All right.

2174
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:05,000
X-Men and The Simpsons Arcade have suddenly disappeared from the PlayStation Network.

2175
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:17,000
They are still available on Xbox Live Arcade and doubly so, considering that they are also available on the Last Chance on Marvel game sale that Xbox Live is currently running right now.

2176
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:24,000
No official word. The polygon has reached out to Konami to figure out why this has happened.

2177
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:32,000
But no changes in price on Xbox Live, Xbox Live Arcade, but outright removed from Sony's PlayStation Network listings.

2178
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Licensing, maybe it remains to be seen that it's so console specific.

2179
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:44,000
It could also be that the holidays are delaying activity on Xbox Live. I would be interested to see if that's still the case in two weeks.

2180
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:50,000
D-listings do not require human intervention. If they wanted something delisted, it's gone.

2181
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Either that or, you know, legal, marketing, whoever deals with this at Konami just plain fucked up.

2182
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Maybe.

2183
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:05,000
You delist it. You either schedule a delisting or you take it down. There is no ifs, ands, or buts about this.

2184
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:10,000
I'm just taking you back to the Skullgirls stuff last week and it seemed like it was staggered on the two and...

2185
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:16,000
That had a contractual end though, so they wouldn't do it before then and everybody was aware that that was actually going to happen.

2186
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:21,000
This is just straight delisting for a game that... games that probably don't even really need it.

2187
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Well, and Simpsons was a PlayStation Plus free game for a while. That's how I got it, which I find interesting.

2188
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Yeah.

2189
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Alright, well, sadly, not going to be able to get that anymore.

2190
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I wonder if it's still on their servers though, so if I delete the game from my drive, can I actually get the game back?

2191
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
In fact, oh shit, I think I did delete it. I wonder if I can get it back. Uh oh.

2192
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Might be gone forever.

2193
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Never know what you lose until it's gone.

2194
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I guess so.

2195
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Alright, well, we appreciate all the emails we get every week and we try not to lose those.

2196
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:52,000
And yes, it's the same theme song for the Mailbag.

2197
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the Mailbag head first. Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

2198
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
They left this goo in here.

2199
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Maybe you'll be asking us things or maybe you'll be telling us things. It's the Mailbag segment.

2200
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Dark Soccer, take it away.

2201
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Um, oh, this one was to me.

2202
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Dear Jamie, I was offended on your behalf for the email bashing you guys for voicing your opinion on the VGX show.

2203
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:21,000
What benefit do people get from writing into talk shows to bash commentators for their thoughts?

2204
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
I wasn't really offended.

2205
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Oh, and Reagan's policies didn't actually destroy the economy. They saved it from the gas lines of the Carter.

2206
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Yeah, but it set the pace for the thing we have now.

2207
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Too much politics. Syntax error. Ready.

2208
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:43,000
He also built the foundation for the prosperity. We saw in the 90s it took Clinton and Bush number two to really ruin the economy.

2209
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
And Nickelback doesn't completely suck. They only kind of suck.

2210
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Thanks to the great show lab rat Y2K.

2211
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,000
That was a laundry list of internet insult memes right there.

2212
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:00,000
I could argue the politics behind that with some hard numbers, but I will not.

2213
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Got one from CK Ender.

2214
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Hey, OLR. I'll start by saying I've been a loyal podcast listener for about two years and I hope you'll keep doing what you're doing as you guys are an integral part of my Monday afternoons.

2215
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Hopefully I won't be criticized too harshly on grammar, but something I heard on the show this past weekend, 12, 15, 13, stuck with me.

2216
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:26,000
I understand that this topic is too political to read on the show, but I felt like I had to write this.

2217
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:33,000
When you folks mentioned the NSA is spying on our MMOs, I felt like there is a bit of misinformation on the lack of information you've been provided with.

2218
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:42,000
There's a more global reach to what they are doing. It's not only to listen for communications of any terrorist activities or things of that nature.

2219
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:51,000
It's a known fact that in 2011, North Korea formed several farms for Walgold, which it was selling the proceeds of funding their nuclear weapons program.

2220
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Yeah, there was that too.

2221
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:05,000
The practice is comparable to diamond trafficking from Africa to fund warlords or the opium trades in the Middle East funding any of the terrorist groups there.

2222
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Now I'm not employed by the NSA or any government agency for that matter, but it's been speculated that what they are doing is making purchases from these gold sellers and tracking the funds in an effort to shut down the operations and thus limiting the funds of our national adversaries.

2223
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Sure, people may think it's a waste of taxpayers monies to have people sit around and play well, but frankly, if it can help financially disarm a nuclear program, then why not?

2224
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
That's a very good point.

2225
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
The age we live in is not only an age of physical conflict, but wars are fought in cyberspace as well.

2226
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:41,000
The fact that this is just coming to open news does not mean it's not something that has been going on for ages.

2227
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:50,000
The example I cited earlier is not the only one. China has been using prisons to farm gold for sellers and several MMOs, while being, of course, the predominant one due to its population.

2228
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Now once a player purchases from any gold seller, it opens them up for identity fraud, thus providing further resources such as additional funds, social security numbers, ID, and things of that sort.

2229
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:07,000
And as tensions grow tighter in international affairs, it's reasonable that the government looks into this. Think of all the folks who buy gold on a daily basis.

2230
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Players may feel they're getting ahead in a video game, but they may also be unknowingly funding nuclear warfare, foreign governments, and any other number of illicit trades or activities.

2231
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Can I stop here for a minute just real quick, just because I have to say this, because as a big time MMO player and all this, this really bugs me.

2232
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:32,000
People need to stop buying gold online. People need to realize what, and I don't necessarily think every time they're buying gold they're necessarily funding all of this.

2233
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Not to discredit the emailer's opinion, because I think it's a very well thought out point, and I think this emailer brings up some good points that are completely valid.

2234
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:50,000
But I just think we need, as MMO players, to stop buying gold in the first place, because not only is it necessarily funding this stuff, but it's funding the theft of accounts.

2235
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:58,000
It's funding these companies that will do anything to get the gold in game, including compromised accounts, and you're usually putting your own self at risk.

2236
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:04,000
Do not buy third party currency in these games. You are part of the problem if you're doing that.

2237
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I had to get that off my chest because it's a huge pet peeve of mine.

2238
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:18,000
I'm with you on that one too, but I do have to say that the gold farming scheme from North Korea ended up not being a very big contributor to their programs.

2239
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Make it not worth it. That's what I'm saying. We all have to take that responsibility. Make it not worth it.

2240
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:29,000
If I'm right, I believe it was abandoned, so the information went. Anyway, let me get back into, where was I?

2241
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:37,000
So to say, at the NSA there are a bunch of spies spying on Americans, as some people have, is not entirely accurate.

2242
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:47,000
So with that, I wouldn't say they are looking on the average player who could leak information or communicate with terrorist cells, but to limit the financial gain of any group or nation who wishes to fund themselves in this nature.

2243
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:59,000
And that's a good point. But I don't think, however, that the attempts to do so in the past have been as successful as they were probably hoping it would be.

2244
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
That's my thought, but I'll continue.

2245
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Maybe if there was a little less transparency, there'd be more people kind of quick to believe that if they could see this value that you're pointing out.

2246
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:18,000
But to be fair, I mean, we're kind of making assumptions to agree with this emailer, too. There's assumptions all around, right?

2247
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Well, let me read the next part.

2248
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:28,000
As for the right to do this, a thing that happened shortly after 9-11 called the Patriot Act. Oh, that's a whole other can of worms.

2249
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:34,000
The bill passed with very little contest from anyone praised by millions. Those who spoke out against it were chastised and berated.

2250
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:42,000
It essentially gave the NSA, I'm going to insert a word because I think it was left out, power to do whatever they wish in the defense of terrorism.

2251
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:52,000
While I do not know where the hosts of the show stand on that topic in particular, we sit here 12 years later chastising the NSA for doing something the nation encouraged them to do in the first place.

2252
02:39:52,000 --> 02:40:01,000
I myself was completely against that because it was it seemed like a big knee jerk reaction, as many people in this country are apt to do.

2253
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:10,000
While I don't have a problem with surveillance, as long as there is transparency that the surveillance is happening, I'm perfectly fine with that.

2254
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:21,000
I would have no problem with CCTV all over the place, because honestly, the only people who should be worried about having their stuff tracked are people who have something to hide.

2255
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Not all I mean, not to again, not to get too political, but just something to think about. Not all surveillance is necessarily bad.

2256
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Here's an example. I like it when the mall parking lot has surveillance, so that if something happens to my car, you have it on tape.

2257
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Or what about for those hotels that have CCTV and caught, you know, murders happening or, you know, people being attacked? What about that whole, what's that called the knockout game thing?

2258
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:58,000
But when, but anyway, but you know, when you're going to the mall, maybe the criminals are too dumb to remember, but you know, you're probably going to be on film.

2259
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:03,000
But it's when that privacy, that reasonable expectation for privacy is breached that people get pissed off.

2260
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:08,000
And I think a lot of people assumed that the cybering they were doing in MMO games was private.

2261
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Well, honestly, and I'm just going to say this right now. I have no problem with having my dirty laundry out there, because honestly, the fuck they didn't care.

2262
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Well, let's get started, girl.

2263
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:32,000
No, no, no. I don't think you know what I mean. You know, if, if they have my juvie record from when I was in high school.

2264
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
You were in juvie? You're hardcore.

2265
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Yes, I was.

2266
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,000
I didn't know that.

2267
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Yes, I was.

2268
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Because my mom was not able to handle me because I was a big fucking brat and a lot smarter than she was.

2269
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Okay.

2270
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
End of story. I mean, that's how it is.

2271
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
She will freely admit she couldn't handle me.

2272
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:51,000
And so I went, I was a perfect little angel and they're like, what the fuck she's doing here?

2273
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:54,000
And send me back. That's seriously how it went.

2274
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
And I ran away from home a couple of times, cause fuck that place.

2275
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
In closing,

2276
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
The cmail got a lot. All right.

2277
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
I don't care who knows that.

2278
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
It's part of who you are now.

2279
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Everybody's got something.

2280
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
It made me the awesome person I am today.

2281
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:13,000
So in closing, I do love the show and appreciate that you give everyone a voice and remain subjective.

2282
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I will happily continue to listen so long as the show continues to be open minded.

2283
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Provide me with hours of video game news and overall entertainment.

2284
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Thank you so much.

2285
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
CK, CK Ender.

2286
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:26,000
And for the record, I was not a troublemaker in school.

2287
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:30,000
I got in one fight that anyone saw that had a witness.

2288
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Would you say your mama got scared?

2289
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
By me having one fight?

2290
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Oh, no, I know what you mean now.

2291
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
No, it wasn't Fresh Prince.

2292
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:42,000
No, and I didn't have lots of visits to the principal's office.

2293
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
My problems were strictly at home.

2294
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:49,000
But there was this one girl who was just irritating the shit out of me.

2295
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Throwing, cause I was the, you know, the gothy geeky girl that no one liked.

2296
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:59,000
I mean, until I just made myself a complete nuisance and made friends with everybody because I could and joined every club.

2297
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
It was my revenge.

2298
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:05,000
But finally one day she like pushed me in the hall and I turned around and punched her in the face.

2299
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Like hard.

2300
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
I think I cracked her cheekbone actually.

2301
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:14,000
But she wouldn't tell anybody that happened and one of the janitors saw it and they had been seeing it happen.

2302
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:18,000
And they're like, good for you. I'm not telling anybody what happened.

2303
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Well, to go back to the email, I just will say I have an open mind with that email.

2304
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Not to suck up, but just, you know, at the end there, I do have an open mind at the email.

2305
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
I think it was a well presented perspective.

2306
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Thank you.

2307
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:35,000
It paints a very good alternative to something that has been a truth for the last decade.

2308
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:43,000
And not just the oh god NSA spying that every governmental black box is being shoved into in the last year.

2309
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:47,000
It paints a good devil's advocate perspective we weren't able to do last week.

2310
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:52,000
I will say though, we do have some chat comments of course over at live.vognetwork.com

2311
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Let's see, what was the comment about?

2312
02:43:55,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Ah, mm2k in chat says, okay, that's World of Warcraft, but what about their Xbox Live spying?

2313
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
What's the justification?

2314
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Dungeon Buster says, if it involves telecommunications, you can always assume that there will be someone out there trying to find a way to tap it.

2315
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
NSA has had its wrists slapped as far back as the 70s.

2316
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:15,000
There was congressional outrage and then nothing happened until the next scandal.

2317
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
This is not their first rodeo.

2318
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Rama says they've been doing this for years and now people are acting out about it.

2319
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Fuck out of here.

2320
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Interesting perspectives all over.

2321
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Let's move on to the next email though for time's sake.

2322
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Well, that was actually the end of that email regardless.

2323
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
So thank you for the well thought out email.

2324
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:36,000
We have two left. One of them is still UT, but it's not long.

2325
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Hey guys, first of all...

2326
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Good job editing first off.

2327
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:42,000
First off, count me among the people who actually like Nickelback.

2328
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Not the greatest band in the world, but they're enjoyable enough and don't deserve nearly the level of crap they get.

2329
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Next email.

2330
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Shut up.

2331
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

2332
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Shut up.

2333
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:57,000
While the show is mostly enjoyable, I have to bring up the continued ignoring of all the other services while looking at the feed of Gabe Neal.

2334
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:02,000
You know what? I actually like Steam, so I'm using what I like, so whatever.

2335
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:07,000
While I don't ask that you ignore Steam sales, they're clearly exciting for Steam's user base.

2336
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:14,000
But the way you and most other games media go on, people would be forgiven for thinking that Steam was all that mattered in the PC space.

2337
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Meanwhile, you guys are ignoring the massive GOG holiday sales, where over 600 plus titles going up to half off are the massive 48 hour free Fallout giveaway they did.

2338
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
There are also...

2339
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
I didn't know about it until you just said that.

2340
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
There are also sales on...

2341
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:32,000
I took advantage of that.

2342
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,000
What's that? Loki?

2343
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
I took advantage of that.

2344
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Why didn't you tell me?

2345
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
It's fine.

2346
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:41,000
There are also sales on Indie Game Stand, Humble Store, and Desura.

2347
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Recently, the only time you guys have ever mentioned anything other than a Steam sale was not on Steam sale, was basically developers trying to drum up support for getting greenlit.

2348
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:58,000
By the way, there was one that CatastrophicMoggie linked me to, that I can't remember, it was a UK site that takes international funds, but had a Doctor Who game on there.

2349
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:02,000
That I was very close to getting, but I cannot for the life of me remember the URL now.

2350
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:10,000
I just want to say though, you mentioned Humble, or the emailer mentioned Humble Store, and we cover almost every single Humble Bundle that comes out, because they're always such great deals.

2351
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:11,000
And they give Steam keys.

2352
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Yeah.

2353
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:30,000
And I'll mention that the last Steam sale, or maybe the one before last, I was mentioning a lot about Amazon had better deals, and even I think Gamefly was doing some deals and stuff that were better than what was on the Steam store, and there's a lot of alternatives out there.

2354
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:46,000
I'm sure there's more to come, but just a blanket statement, the reason why Steam tends to get the most coverage is Steam is the most prolific, and not to belittle what the other stores are doing, but keep in mind that Steam is trying to do things that are beyond the storefront.

2355
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:54,000
And I love good old games. I think it's great that there's a method set up for some of those classics. I love my classics.

2356
02:46:54,000 --> 02:47:10,000
I love good old games, and I'm glad to hear they're having sales and a lot of that stuff is available, but keep in mind that Steam also is pushing things forward with the trading card thing, with the family sharing, with the operating system.

2357
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:24,000
And even though you might not necessarily be a fan of any of that, you can't deny that these are things that are pushing stores in general in another direction. That's why they tend to dominate the coverage.

2358
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:38,000
It's a little bit of a two-edged sword, and I know what he's getting at. You make a very fair point in the sense that there is a lot of non-monetary news like Steam Machine announcement and everything else that's been happened.

2359
02:47:38,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Yes, Steam does a ton of new things that are making waves in the news. That said, I said just myself today, I picked up Electronic Super Joy for $1.50 and You Don't Know Jack for $5, and we do off-the-cuff these games that we got for dirt cheap from Steam way more often than any other vendor out there.

2360
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:15,000
So I 100% agree with his point. I interject the fact that news is important too, but I completely agree that we definitely do bias Steam for our look at our deals, look at our steels kind of thing.

2361
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Three comments. SSJ100Matt says, we've mentioned GOG in the past. Keep in mind he does have a deep dislike towards Steam.

2362
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, 75% of my Steam stuff comes from the humble bundles and the rest from huge sales they have. And Fifth Dream says, Indie Royale.

2363
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Yeah, I think I bought one of their bundles once. But anyway, not to belittle the email, it's a fair point that don't all sales deserve equal coverage.

2364
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:52,000
And I think this show sometimes, and this has come up on another topic, tends to be a reflection of what gamers are talking about. And Steam, look at whatever gaming blogs are out there.

2365
02:48:53,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Steam does typically dominate that coverage. But I'm all for, you know what, if there's this great indie thing going on and you guys email in about it or tweet us or get it to our attention, I'm all about getting this stuff exposure. Absolutely.

2366
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:19,000
We have no problem mentioning any of this. It just happens to be whatever we've kind of... And honestly, there's just sometimes I pull up Steam just to peruse their, you know, library, find something completely bizarre.

2367
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:26,000
And go, that's freaking weird. Like that... What was that game, Loki, the ballpoint shooter?

2368
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Let's see, that was... Because I bought it. Look it up now because I don't remember. It was ballpoint, ballpoint universe infinite. It was one of like some green light game that looked pretty cool.

2369
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:51,000
It was just a neat concept. So it was like two bucks click. You know, I had that lovely wallet. Thank you, Loki. You're welcome. I have used it all up yesterday.

2370
02:49:52,000 --> 02:50:07,000
To continue with the email, which is nearly done. Again, I feel the need to reiterate that I don't have anything against people who like Steam. However, the media blackout on anything that isn't Steam only serves to undermine what should be an open platform, essentially turning it into a Valve console.

2371
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Well, I hope you guys don't take this as offensive. And I rarely do. No. Though I imagine people are already shit talking me in your chat.

2372
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Only a little bit, but not really. I wouldn't say shit. No, I wouldn't either. I put it around the line of a juicy fart. I'm kidding. I actually have zero problem with RawsteelUT personally.

2373
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:45,000
When points are presented succinctly like this. He makes good points that may not always be popular. Yes. And I'm all for hearing the points that may not be popular when they're presented in a tactful manner.

2374
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Yes. It has to go to tact. When it's fuck you, you fucking fuck, I'm not going to hear it. But he doesn't do that. No. And see, I have no problem with information being presented to me that may be kind of the opposite of what I think.

2375
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:07,000
As long as it's presented in an intellectually and fact-based manner. And that's kind of two emails tonight that have done that. I know. And I love it. I freaking love it.

2376
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:23,000
I mean, that's why I actually look at progressive Republican websites. I don't know if I told you that. To look for the conservative point of view. I listen to conservative talk radio. Done from an intelligent manner. So, anyway.

2377
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Unfortunately, what I hear isn't always intelligent, but some of it's pretty good. But anyway.

2378
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Just know that I still enjoy your show. I'm just asking for a teeny bit more fairness. Regards, Ross till UT. P.S. I also love me some Lady Gaga. I'm not a huge fan of Beyonce, though. You were entitled to that opinion.

2379
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Okay, his music tastes are redeemed a little bit, at least. I just like calling Beyonce, Bejesus. Yeah. Bejesus. No, because that was Bejesus and Ramona. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

2380
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:17,000
So, I can't go there. I have to call her Bejesus. Those were my books growing up. Or if we were going to do the J with the Y sounds as Bejesus. More emails? Yes. Last one. Last one. I think. Hi, OLR. Hi. Hi. I'm sending you a very last minute email this week with a timely theme with a question and response to my own question. Really?

2381
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Now, here we go. Ellipse. Now that the Steam Winter Sale is underway until 1-3-14, what five games per person response that are on sale you think everyone should buy provided that they don't already have said games and that they actually afford to buy them?

2382
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:45,000
You have to appreciate the irony of this email. I fucking do. I fucking do. Even Ross Steele, even though you're sitting there rolling your eyes to the back of your head right now, you have to appreciate the irony.

2383
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:59,000
There are three letters on Ross Steele, UT's forehead right now, and it's S-M-H. All right. Anyhow. Okay. Well, I will go ahead and read our readers in a spazzinator, by the way. Yes. A rage-inator now.

2384
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:13,000
For me, I recommend the following games in no particular order. Flat Out, Magic 2014 Special Edition, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, Strike Suit Zero Mega Bundle, and Pinball FX2 Tables. Any or all of them. Any and all of them.

2385
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:27,000
I don't know, Rob. What do you say? Civ V, Spelunky, Rogue Legacy, Super Hexagon. Really?

2386
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Which I haven't talked a lot about on this show, but that fucking thing is addicting as hell. And Path of Exile in the free-to-play section.

2387
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:57,000
I'm probably going to go with The Stanley Parable, because it's on sale right now. The Angry Video Game Nerd game. It's a pretty fun little platformer, especially if you're a fan of his reviews.

2388
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:09,000
I will also go with DuckTales. It's on sale. Even though I already have it, I'm just saying that for people who don't have it right now, it's on sale, so go get it.

2389
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:34,000
What else was I playing? Bioshock Infinite, which I haven't started yet, but I'm still excited about playing it. I'd actually say Dragon Age Origins, because it's five bucks now for whatever the great version is. I have me some elves to play as.

2390
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Loki, I don't know if you can think of five Steam games, or after the email before, any PC platform games that are worth checking out right now?

2391
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:54,000
I would probably go with... It's tough, because depending on what you have already. Borderlands 2, if you don't have that already. Bioshock Infinite.

2392
02:54:54,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Probably... Let's see... Skyrim, if you don't have Skyrim. Just Cause 2. Only when it goes on the flash sale, because it's only... It's funny, it was on sale for more than it is now on sale for.

2393
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:25,000
But just because of the multiplayer mod. I guess maybe Surgeon Simulator 2013.

2394
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Jason?

2395
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:35,000
My overlap is pretty funny, but You Don't Know Jack, Starbound, Rogue Legacy, Just Cause 2, and Papers, Please.

2396
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Oh, I need to check out Papers, Please myself. Also, Tech2030 in chat says, even though people don't call it a real using quotey fingers game, I'm gonna say Gone Home. That's another good pick.

2397
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Yeah, I need to start that.

2398
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Alright.

2399
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
If anybody out there doesn't have the Stanley parable, freakin' get it.

2400
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:58,000
It's on my list of things to check out. I have it. I bought it in the last sale. Just things to check out during this week.

2401
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
I don't remember if I actually picked it up or not. I know I want to. I know I want to check it out.

2402
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:03,000
It's eleven bucks right now.

2403
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:11,000
ActDeaf suggesting Dust and Elysian Tail. And some folks in chat commenting, Loki, are you wrapping a present in the background? Because we can hear it.

2404
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:13,000
My wife is.

2405
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Hi, Nelly!

2406
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Merry Christmas to whoever. You might just want to mute yourself locally on Skype, Loki, when you're not talking just so we don't hear the wrapping.

2407
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:22,000
That's alright.

2408
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
It takes some getting used to when you do it in person for so long.

2409
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Alright, where else are we at? That's it for that email, right?

2410
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,000
That was the last email.

2411
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:41,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future. And hopefully we'll get some nice, like I would love to see two emails that counter each other back to back.

2412
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
We need more of that in future weeks. That's always hilarious. Those are my favorite.

2413
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:48,000
Some other, just some more comments from chat. And this is just PC gaming in general, really.

2414
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:54,000
William Murderface saying, don't forget Guild Wars 2 if you're looking for a different MMO experience. I think they're running a promotion right now.

2415
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:58,000
I got an email from them. That might be directly through ArenaNet for that.

2416
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Cial says Reprisal is a good populist clone that's still being worked on. Did I say Act F's Dust and Elysian Tail? If I didn't, then I said it again, I guess.

2417
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Alright.

2418
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Divekick.

2419
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:18,000
I'd also say Duke Nukem, remember Duke Nukem 3D I think was down to 2 bucks, like the old school one. And we have multiplayer in beta now.

2420
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
It might be in the flash sale at 2 am. I know I'll be up checking.

2421
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week. Because we're mad, even though it's the holidays. The holidays bring out the worst in us.

2422
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
F you Rob, because frivolous.

2423
02:57:48,000 --> 02:58:00,000
No, right now my voice is kind of going out and I have stuff I have to do this week. And also I'm a little bit jealous that my computer hasn't been upgraded when Vans was.

2424
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:08,000
But I understand our friend that was helping us out has become quite ill and it's going around. So just feel better soon.

2425
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Soon George.

2426
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:14,000
You're awesome for doing this for us and thank you for helping us pick out bits of our computers.

2427
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Feel better George. We have some little banter on Twitter now and again.

2428
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:23,000
By the way, I'm going to have like 50 bajillion USB ports on the front of my computer or something like that.

2429
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Nice. I'll go next. My FU of the week goes to, I think I pulled a muscle last night while I was sleeping because I was super drunk last night.

2430
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Some of y'all are going to think I have a problem. I'm always responsible. I wasn't driving or anything. I was indulging because of the holidays.

2431
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:47,000
But yeah, I was out with grandpa last night from Wardhouse. That's all I have to tell you. All right.

2432
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:53,000
And yeah, I think because of that I slept really weird, but I didn't have a hangover today and Alan did.

2433
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:59,000
So I will say thank you to whatever is out there watching over me for not giving me a hangover.

2434
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Bless your hydration and your liver.

2435
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Yeah, trying to teach me a lesson. Yeah, I did have a bottle of water before I left the place. That was probably smart.

2436
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:09,000
I will tell everybody this just a piece a piece of advice.

2437
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:24,000
If you take a B 50 complex and drink a glass of water before you're going to have a night of frivolous drinking for the low drinking to you are less likely to have a hangover and also invest in ginger pills because they do help with nausea.

2438
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
About a B 52 complex.

2439
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:32,000
SGA 100 Matt in chat says we got to get grandpa an OLR. Actually, it's funny you bring that up.

2440
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:39,000
We are he offered yesterday to do a live show from San Francisco at his place.

2441
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:44,000
And I actually think that's something we could swing because ironically enough, Jason's in San Francisco right now.

2442
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:50,000
So we just down the street for him. So I'm thinking around the time that Loki's gonna be out because the baby's here.

2443
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:56,000
That might be a good time for Jamie and I to get in the car go to San Francisco. We might actually do that as long as I haven't started my job.

2444
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:02,000
So we'll see what we it is actually a possibility in our roadshow because we're in San Francisco.

2445
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:07,000
We might be able to get some really great guests in studio who else is going to be there.

2446
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:13,000
Yeah, no, I know. Yeah, so it's on the list. That's all I'm going to say.

2447
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
Loki, your turn.

2448
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:23,000
All right. I guess F you to my mouth because it's still a little bit sore from surgery.

2449
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
It's almost done. I can eat food now.

2450
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
All right. Glad to hear you're getting better though.

2451
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Jason, if you did a stupid cough, I still can't quite kick and has also seemed to want to be more prolific despite cough drops in the last 30 minutes, hours, something like that.

2452
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:44,000
I'm sure all this talking is not exactly helping it terribly well, but you know, whatever.

2453
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:51,000
F you to money again, just kind of in general, but more specifically, F you to GE Financial.

2454
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:58,000
They're dumb and the fact that they make it so hard for me to be able to actually see bills and manage finances.

2455
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:04,000
You're making it hard. You're going against the ability for utilities to actually make things easier.

2456
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:09,000
Credit, you know, debt planning, that kind of stuff. GE Financial, F you.

2457
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Lastly, awkward moments in public. I was at the post office and there were customers that decided to get into not literally, but verbal fisticuffs with each other.

2458
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:29,000
And it was insanely awkward and I had to make sure that I didn't want to jump in and try to pacify it because I would not have pacified it.

2459
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:34,000
I wouldn't have done anything, but I would not have pacified it. I just would have gotten involved.

2460
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:46,000
There is inevitably a mental illness that spearheaded a large portion of this, which is unfortunate, but the moment itself, F you.

2461
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:55,000
Alright, let us start to wrap up the show here with just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2462
03:01:55,000 --> 03:02:01,000
And yes, you can still call 1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, but we're not there just yet.

2463
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:03,000
We have a couple more stories for you guys first. Loki.

2464
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:09,000
Yes, and since we talked about the VGX over the last few weeks, the final numbers are in.

2465
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:18,000
They had 1.1 million views, which exceeded their expectations, and they said there was a lot of great feedback that came out of it.

2466
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:30,000
And sure, there's people calling for the date and time of my suicide, and this is Jeff Kiely, but there were people who also said very constructive things about the show.

2467
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:37,000
So it sounds like it was a success and they're planning on doing it next year as well.

2468
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:49,000
People from 109 countries tuned in, average viewer spending 32 minutes watching it, which is funny because it's about the time I watched it, about 30 minutes.

2469
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:54,000
So you were Joe average in that case?

2470
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:56,000
I guess so.

2471
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:58,000
Is that your cat?

2472
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:08,000
That is my cat. She just got let out of, because she was getting into all the rapping stuff, so we had the locker in the middle bedroom, and she comes out and does her cry and stuff.

2473
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Aww.

2474
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
Yeah, she's a douchebag sometimes.

2475
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:21,000
So it sounds like the VGX was really well rated, so it probably is coming back next year, despite anything we might have said that week aired.

2476
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:25,000
Maybe without Joel McHale this time, would be my guess.

2477
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:31,000
Yeah, or more like the version that was on TV, which was totally edited and different, but we'll see.

2478
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:41,000
They should do Ayesha Tyler or something like that, because she's actually kind of into games and stuff, and I think that would be pretty good.

2479
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:45,000
Maybe give some comedy lessons to Jeff there.

2480
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:50,000
I'd love to see Ayesha Tyler involved with that, that would be fun. We'll see.

2481
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:55,000
Alright, lastly but not leastly, a story on the Atari 2600.

2482
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:08,000
Well, okay, it's not really like the console, there's nothing new happening with the console, but there's a documentary being made about the game industry crash of 1983, which really took out the Atari 2600.

2483
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
And then, of course, they buried all the cartridges in the desert.

2484
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:17,000
Well, they actually made a documentary about this, and I seem to remember talking about this on a show before, that this documentary was in progress.

2485
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:27,000
Well, the Canadian film production company Fuel Industries actually is going to this landfill to try to find all the cartridges, although you're going to find a bunch of melted plastic.

2486
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:38,000
But anyway, this whole thing is going to happen from this film company, and they're actually going to release a documentary on Xbox on 2014.

2487
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:42,000
This is through the new media company that Microsoft has, Lightbox.

2488
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:48,000
So this is one of those, I guess, maybe Xbox exclusive programs things to kind of compete with Netflix.

2489
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:59,000
I mean, Netflix does exclusive documentaries, they're really heavily promoting their Mitt Romney documentary they're going to be doing about how they were there when it's on camera when he found out he lost the election.

2490
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:01,000
So that's going to be in a new documentary on Netflix.

2491
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:05,000
So this is kind of like, you know, Xbox is beefing up with its own gaming documentary.

2492
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,000
So I think that's cool.

2493
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:09,000
Do you like documentaries?

2494
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:11,000
I do. I actually watch quite a number of them.

2495
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:18,000
In fact, yesterday I watched a whole series about the medieval attitude towards marriage, birth, and death.

2496
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:24,000
And with the change of the Anglican Reformation.

2497
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:29,000
Would they call that Romney documentary The Biggest Loser?

2498
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:31,000
Oh, stop. It's just called-

2499
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:34,000
Redertainment said we didn't find shit, the documentary where we don't find shit.

2500
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
You probably will find some shit, but not the shit you're looking for.

2501
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:39,000
It would be like when Geraldo opened that tomb.

2502
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:41,000
I was just thinking that.

2503
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:43,000
I was just thinking that.

2504
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:45,000
Look, nothing.

2505
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Yeah.

2506
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:49,000
So, oh well.

2507
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:51,000
Alright.

2508
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
It's going to be a big bomb and everyone's going to be like, yay bomb.

2509
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:58,000
Uh, that is, that is it for the news.

2510
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:06,000
We are about to go to the Skype line, but since I do have to free up the Skype line for the night, this is the part of the show where we're going to say goodbye to Loki.

2511
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
Loki, thanks for being here on the show tonight.

2512
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:11,000
Not a problem.

2513
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Do you have any final, well first I should ask, do you have any quick last minute stories for our listeners?

2514
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
Just one small one. It's Grand Theft Auto 5 related.

2515
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:23,000
There's going to be, actually it was kind of leaked out that there's going to be some Christmas DLC.

2516
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:36,000
They've already started patching it in and if you happen to be playing Grand Theft Auto online, if you look up at the sky, you'll notice that some light snow is falling and pretty soon that light snow is going to turn into heavy snow as we get towards Christmas.

2517
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:47,000
So, full snow in Los Santos and there's going to be some like Santa costume thing that you can get for your characters.

2518
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:49,000
Alright.

2519
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:56,000
Loki, thanks for being on the show tonight. Have a wonderful holiday. Have fun with Christmas with Josh and Nellie and all that.

2520
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
And do you have any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?

2521
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:03,000
No, not really. Just have a good holiday everyone.

2522
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:08,000
Alright, well thanks for being here tonight Loki and take care of yourself and best of luck.

2523
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:10,000
And rub your wife's feet.

2524
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:12,000
Yes, rub your wife's feet.

2525
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
Alright, bye Nellie. Bye you guys, take care.

2526
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:17,000
Bye.

2527
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:21,000
Loki, I don't know if he'll pop in chat. He might show up in chat a little later in the show. We'll see.

2528
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:23,000
I thought he was already in chat.

2529
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
Alright, but in the meantime, Jamie's going to answer this call.

2530
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:28,000
I am?

2531
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
Yes, because Alan just brought dinner. I want dinner. So, sorry about it.

2532
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
Hey, this is OLR. What's up?

2533
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:36,000
Hey, this is Act Theft.

2534
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:41,000
Hi, Act Theft. Thank you for visiting my village. I'm glad you still love Animal Crossing.

2535
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:52,000
Well, I still play it on occasion. Not as much as I did a few months ago, but I may pick it up again to do the rest of the stuff I haven't done.

2536
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
I brought Dan into making a tent in my village.

2537
03:07:56,000 --> 03:08:03,000
Yeah, I saw it. I saw the tent and I left Dan a present too. Well, a letter and a present.

2538
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:05,000
So, what's up tonight?

2539
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Well, a little follow-up to the email Ross Tillyute sent. Basically, there's a lot of sites that sell or do bundles, sells games for sheep.

2540
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:40,000
DRM, Steam activated and all that stuff. There was a few mentioned in chat, like Indie Royale that sell bundles for games that are recently developed or recently released.

2541
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:49,000
They're pretty cool games and they're activated on Steam and they have also Viscera activated games and DRM free.

2542
03:08:49,000 --> 03:09:00,000
There's also another page I mentioned in chat earlier, Indie Gala, that also sells DRM free games.

2543
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:14,000
I think right now they have Euro Truck Simulator 2, DRM free and Steam activated for pretty cheap. I think less than $5.

2544
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:18,000
That's pretty cool. Do you also mind putting links in the chat room too?

2545
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:20,000
Yeah, I will.

2546
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Let me ask you, I'm back. Hi, I'm eating but I'm going to pop in with questions once in a while.

2547
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:32,000
Let me ask you this question Actif, since you seem pretty prolific on the sales that are going on and you're a thrifty gamer, let's say.

2548
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:39,000
Kind of going back to that email that came in, why do you think everybody's up Steam's ass?

2549
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
How so?

2550
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:51,000
Why is it that gaming websites in general tend to focus more on Steam than anything else?

2551
03:09:52,000 --> 03:10:01,000
Basically because it's the most popular. It's really popular out there and there's millions maybe that use Steam.

2552
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:08,000
And even that's pretty much the start of it all. So it's basically popularity.

2553
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:14,000
There are many sites that cover deals and stuff that we all know cheap as gamers.

2554
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Well I hold their Twitter feed and they post about deals and stuff from a lot of places, not only Steam.

2555
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:34,000
Like Amazon, Green Man Gaming that sells a pretty good site for deals, even cheaper than Steam and Amazon.

2556
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:41,000
I got the Brave New World expansion for Civilization V for cheaper than Steam has it.

2557
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:46,000
So it's a pretty great site too and they also sell DRM-free stuff.

2558
03:10:49,000 --> 03:11:00,000
But basically it's all popularity and really since all the games that are sold on all those sites activate in Steam.

2559
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:05,000
So basically it's like you already have it, so why not?

2560
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:14,000
Fair enough. I think also all the extra stuff Steam has to do, building the achievements and the friend talks, that's kind of smart too.

2561
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:23,000
I mean I realize like Tesura has some of that and some of the other competitors, but I think that goes a long way too in making Steam a little more than just a store.

2562
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:34,000
Not that I'm, you know, I understand that we should kind of tip a hat to everybody that's got a really great sale going on, although I don't think we could ever possibly cover every great sale in gaming.

2563
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
But I think it is why people tend to focus on Steam.

2564
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,000
So anyway, Act F before we let you go, any other thoughts?

2565
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:52,000
There's another site that I recently discovered that's called Groopies. G-R-O-U-P-E-E-S dot com.

2566
03:11:53,000 --> 03:12:00,000
That also sells not only games, they also sell music and they have pretty good, great bundles.

2567
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:02,000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2568
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:07,000
Didn't they also host the Magfest donation slash award drive?

2569
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:13,000
Yeah, they did the Magfest bundle and I bought that. It's a pretty great bundle.

2570
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:23,000
Yeah, I mean it's always a great time, you know, every day is a good day for consumers because there's always so many new, fantastic things.

2571
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:31,000
And some of them specialize in ways that may align with your interests more, so seek them out and support them.

2572
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:33,000
Indeed.

2573
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:37,000
Alright Act F, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call.

2574
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:39,000
Thank you. Have a nice.

2575
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:41,000
Alright, take care. Happy Holidays. Bye.

2576
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:46,000
1877 Game O-L-R, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2577
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:50,000
I'm going to try to pull up the Twitter here real quick while I'm in between bites of my dinner.

2578
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:52,000
Oh, but we do have another call coming in.

2579
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:54,000
So Jason, you ready to answer this one?

2580
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
Alright, you ready? You fill that host role.

2581
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:02,000
Alright, here we go, another call on the line while I chow down on some sweet and sour chicken over here.

2582
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:06,000
Also, hello caller. What's your name? Who are you calling from? Where are you calling from?

2583
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:08,000
It's Ron from Brooklyn, man. What's up?

2584
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:10,000
Ronchon!

2585
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:12,000
I sent you a card.

2586
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:14,000
You got what?

2587
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:16,000
I sent you a card.

2588
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
Awesome. You'll be getting your gift tomorrow.

2589
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:26,000
Appropriate for the Christmas spirit. The holiday spirit. The non-dominational spirit.

2590
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:30,000
Denominational. Denominational as well. Words are hard.

2591
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:32,000
Some people like to be dominated.

2592
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:34,000
Let's see, um...

2593
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:36,000
Robby, can you tell us something?

2594
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:38,000
What's up, Ramna?

2595
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:42,000
Okay. Couple of things I want to cover. I'm getting the hell up on out of here.

2596
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:47,000
Now, the whole packs diversity lounge thing, I'm not happy with.

2597
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:54,000
This does not come as any bit of a surprise, but what's your take on it in addition to what we covered previously?

2598
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:59,000
Oh, someone that's gone to cons for years and also staffs conventions as well.

2599
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:08,000
This whole diversity lounge thing, I just feel it's not the responsibility of the convention to have these lounges set up.

2600
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:15,000
If this should be done, let somebody else come in and handle it. Let the con have someone to monitor.

2601
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:20,000
And that's just it. They shouldn't be, like, dictating how things should go.

2602
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:25,000
Because I just see nothing but bad juju coming out of this.

2603
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:30,000
Especially considering the source of the drama is the con organizers themselves.

2604
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:36,000
Yeah, I personally, I give them more or less a pass, because I'm very understanding about various things.

2605
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:42,000
Some people feel that I shouldn't, but it's my thought train, it's my logic, that, you know.

2606
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:51,000
But you are of the opinion that this is something that should exist, just executed slightly differently?

2607
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:57,000
Yeah, because I don't know if you noticed, there's been a lot of crazy shit going on with conventions.

2608
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:04,000
I mean, there was one con where a girl was sexually assaulted and the convention just dropped the entire ball about that.

2609
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:08,000
Oh, they sucked. I read that and was so pissed off.

2610
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:13,000
Yes, and there are con staffers I speak to that run other conventions.

2611
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:21,000
About a third of them say that the con's not at fault here, and that really started a shitstorm, but that's for another time.

2612
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:25,000
And this isn't even just a convention thing in the strictest sense.

2613
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:32,000
Obviously that's where the biggest news and availability comes out, because this is a massive group of people,

2614
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:40,000
and things of this nature can, unfortunately, get caught in the, not even the noise, but also the news,

2615
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:44,000
and that these little things have to really, you know, like, bubble up to become a big deal.

2616
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:51,000
Is this something... I've never been to a con that has something like that.

2617
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:53,000
Neither have I.

2618
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:58,000
But has there ever been a fixed presence in any con you've been to to address these issues?

2619
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:05,000
Not at all. The closest I've been to a convention where we had something like this was Otacon years ago.

2620
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:09,000
We have what was called the black cosplayers social thread.

2621
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:15,000
The point of this was for a bunch of black cosplayers to get together and hang out and say, we don't see each other.

2622
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:22,000
But we kept saying, it's for everyone to join, but it's just for us to get together and hang out, you know, because we don't see each other.

2623
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:29,000
That was going good for a couple of years, so somebody got offended and started the Asian social thread,

2624
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:38,000
and Mexican this, this, and that, until someone came along and started the Aryan Nation social thread, and it shut everything down.

2625
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:51,000
I'm kind of surprised that you went, that there was another list of minorities, although I obviously get a fair amount of the reference in that last group that you just mentioned.

2626
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:56,000
Yeah, it was supposed to be a joke to prove that everybody was being ridiculous about it.

2627
03:16:56,000 --> 03:17:02,000
It was more like just to get together and have a good time. This was something that we were planning more or less.

2628
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:10,000
Now, if the con itself had gotten involved, it probably would have gotten a hell of a lot worse before all this even happened.

2629
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:14,000
Yours had a theme, but not an exclusion, not a restriction.

2630
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:23,000
Right. Now, the whole diversity, I see the similarities, but I just see still it's going to cause a problem.

2631
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:40,000
It's like I said on a friend's Facebook. They're diversifying everything. That means, us folk, we're going to be at the back of the convention center on dial-up, while everybody else is going to be at the front of the convention center on shitty Wi-Fi.

2632
03:17:40,000 --> 03:18:02,000
Despite the difference in mediums, still makes a pretty significant difference. And yeah, as we said, it's only creating a prejudice zone, because whatever people feel that they'll be there, it will only be these individuals there in the first place in large part.

2633
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
Anything else on your mind?

2634
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:18,000
A couple more things. I want to agree with Doc Sacher about the whole DDR and exercise thing, because I did that for a while. DDR four times a day, took vitamins, I ended up dropping like 20 pounds, so I dislocated my knee.

2635
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:45,000
Yeah. Well, the first DDR that Dan ever bought me, the first one I physically owned that wasn't a burn, was Second Mix on Dreamcast. And over that summer, since my birthday in April, I dropped something like 10 to 15 pounds, and I had had some torn tendons in my foot from college in Alabama, and completely healed my foot.

2636
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:59,000
Gotcha. So, I mean, there is such a thing as overdoing and pushing yourself a bit too hard. I think with any exercise, one needs to be careful. Clearly, as it was in your case, too.

2637
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:10,000
Well, I dislocated my knee for other reasons, but... So, DDR is safe. Yeah, yeah. I banged my head on the monitor once. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to overstep you.

2638
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:12,000
I'm sorry. Go ahead, you.

2639
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:19,000
Okay. When I got out of the hospital, my first thought was, well, fuck, can I play DDR again? That was my first thing that came to mind.

2640
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:30,000
Yep. There was one time, and Rob, I think you were there, when I got dizzy playing at the time I was on sevens, and I slipped forward and hit my head on the machine.

2641
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:32,000
I think I was there.

2642
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:34,000
And then I got up and finished it.

2643
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:36,000
That was scary, though.

2644
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:45,000
There was this big red welt on my forehead. That was pretty fun, though. I mean, I can look back at it and laugh now, and I wasn't scared because I was focused on playing, but everyone else was like, oh my god.

2645
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:53,000
Yeah, scary. Alright, well, Rama, we're gonna let you go so we can probably take one more call and then wrap up for the night, but thanks for calling.

2646
03:19:53,000 --> 03:20:04,000
Alright, before I go, I'm just gonna say this. For allowing Anime Jam Session on VOG, for helping us out, and all the good stuff, I have here a shot of sake.

2647
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:10,000
I just want to say, on behalf of Anime Jam Session, the OLR, thanks for everything, happy holidays, and happy new year.

2648
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:18,000
Well, we've got a glass of water, Jason has a Pepsi Wild Cherry, and Dark Sakura has her iPhone, and we're toasting right now. There you go.

2649
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:22,000
And I'm gonna send Jamie a picture of the sake that I took a shot out of.

2650
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:24,000
Alright, take care, buddy. Have a good one.

2651
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:26,000
You too. Alright, bye.

2652
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:30,000
Well, I am done shoving Chinese food down my throat. It was really good, just saying.

2653
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:33,000
It smelled good. I'm sorry. I feel so rude eating it.

2654
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:38,000
You offered any of this. Well, no, you offered, and I said no, and then I realized all I had today was a salad and some cheese.

2655
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:40,000
You realized the mistake you made. Sorry.

2656
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:43,000
It was just I couldn't see anything that wasn't sugary.

2657
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:48,000
Alright, since I am done eating, I will take this last call. Hi, you're on Orange Munch Radio. Who's this?

2658
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:50,000
Hey, this is Brad from Pod Culture.

2659
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:52,000
Hey, this is Brad from Pod Culture. How you doing?

2660
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:54,000
Ah, Pichiken, man. Pichiken.

2661
03:20:55,000 --> 03:21:02,000
Kitty. Long time, no talk, but I know you've still been going on VOG and a lot of great episodes lately, so...

2662
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:05,000
It's not that long, dude. It's only been a few months.

2663
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:07,000
Kitty. It's still a while.

2664
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:13,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dark Sakura talking about my avatar there.

2665
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:16,000
Alright, settle down so Brad can get his thought out. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2666
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:28,000
Well, y'all don't talk too much about mobile games, but I had to call in and tell you about a mobile game that's kind of become crack for Christina and I here of late.

2667
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:32,000
It's Doctor Who Legacy, and it's on iOS and Android.

2668
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:35,000
Yeah, you told me about that. I need to find this.

2669
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:53,000
It's pretty much a bejeweled clone, but they got all kinds of little unlocks and, you know, you can unlock different characters and costumes and levels and all that kind of crap, and there's just something that makes it like crack. You can't stop playing it.

2670
03:21:54,000 --> 03:21:55,000
It's the Doctor.

2671
03:21:56,000 --> 03:22:02,000
You know what's interesting, though, is that usually those Doctor Who games don't really get very good reviews. Like, weren't there someone like the DS or whatever?

2672
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:04,000
Yeah, well, there was one.

2673
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:06,000
There was the Top Trumps game.

2674
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:08,000
Yeah, Top Trumps, and that was alright.

2675
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:10,000
Someone had sent it to me.

2676
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:18,000
There was one on PSN that was kind of bad, like in the eternity clock or something, I think, of what it was.

2677
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:25,000
The rules weren't so great, but this one, you know, if you like Bejeweled or those kind of games and you like Doctor Who, it's perfect.

2678
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:32,000
I had the Mazes of Time game somewhere, and that was kind of a neat little partner puzzle-solving game.

2679
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:36,000
That one, the controls were god-awful. I couldn't stand it.

2680
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:44,000
I didn't mind it that much, and someone had gifted it to me, so I really enjoyed it, but I didn't play very far at it.

2681
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:47,000
Ooh, this has Clara, so I'm definitely downloading it.

2682
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:59,000
Oh yeah, and right now they have an advent calendar type of thing where they release a code a day or a different level a day all throughout the holidays, and the one that came out today was for Sarah Jane.

2683
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:02,000
I love Sarah Jane! She's my favorite.

2684
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:12,000
Yeah, and it's neat. It's a free game, although there are of course in-app purchases where you can buy crystals and crap to level up a little faster, but you don't have to pay a cent for it.

2685
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:22,000
And the developer's been really good at communication, because I've had a couple of issues where I've had to email them twice, and they've responded really fast, within hours.

2686
03:23:23,000 --> 03:23:26,000
Well that's cool. Yeah, well I'm actually downloading it now.

2687
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:30,000
Yeah, it's a lot of fun. It's worth checking out, especially for free.

2688
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:36,000
And I'm fairly addicted to Bejeweled on my phone, so maybe this will fill in my addiction.

2689
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:46,000
Well, I don't mind at all talking about mobile phone games here on the show, and especially one that I kind of think would be of interest to nerds out there.

2690
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:52,000
I think there's probably a lot of people out there that not only like video games, but like their Doctor Who as well.

2691
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:58,000
Yeah, I just wanted to call in and mention that in case folks hadn't heard about it, and check it out. It's fun.

2692
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:02,000
I do have to ask. Did you watch Day of the Doctor?

2693
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:05,000
Oh yeah, I went to the theater and saw it.

2694
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:08,000
Did you get the sniffles at the end?

2695
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:16,000
I was a little disappointed that we didn't see the whole... you talking about with John Hurt?

2696
03:24:17,000 --> 03:24:19,000
No, no, no, no. I'm talking about with Curator.

2697
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:24,000
Oh, that. That was a neat touch.

2698
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:28,000
I had to dry my eyes. And if nobody knows what we're talking about, go watch it.

2699
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:33,000
Oh, I even say better than that, Night of the Doctor.

2700
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:36,000
Yeah, that was pretty good too, because I love Paul McGann.

2701
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:40,000
On a scale of 1 to 10, how excited are you for the Christmas episode?

2702
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:45,000
Oh, well, anything that brings me more Clara is a 10.

2703
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:48,000
Anything that gets rid of Matt Smith. I mean...

2704
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:50,000
Hey, Matt's awesome.

2705
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:53,000
Hey, there's a reason we named the cat Clara.

2706
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:59,000
I don't like Matt Smith's doctor, but I love David Tennant, but nobody tops Tom Baker.

2707
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:03,000
I don't even really watch the show, but Peter Capaldi looks very interesting.

2708
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:05,000
Oh, he's going to be a great doctor.

2709
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:10,000
Oh yeah, he's going to be great, and the little cameo he had in the anniversary special was awesome.

2710
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:12,000
Oh yeah, that was great.

2711
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:17,000
Brad, before we let you go, do you want to give a quick plug for this week's Pod Culture coming up tomorrow on VOG?

2712
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:27,000
Well, it's just the second half of our Case of the Missing Geek series that we did, because Christina was out of town.

2713
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:33,000
We generally do something to make some kind of smart-ass connection between what's going on in the show.

2714
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:40,000
But yeah, we're just talking about TV, and Glenn has his guilty pleasure movies that...

2715
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:44,000
Yeah, this one's... it's bad.

2716
03:25:44,000 --> 03:25:47,000
Oh, I can't wait to hear it, because I love me some guilty pleasure movies.

2717
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:54,000
Alright, of course, lots of great shows all about television and movies throughout the world on Mondays here at the Voice Geeks Network.

2718
03:25:55,000 --> 03:26:03,000
Critical Myth at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern, British Invaders at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, and Pod Culture with Brad right here at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

2719
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:06,000
Brad, thanks so much for the call, and keep on gaming.

2720
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:08,000
Alright, later guys.

2721
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:14,000
Alright, that is going to do it for the Skype line tonight. We're running pretty long tonight, but isn't that always the case here at OLR?

2722
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:16,000
We just never shut up here at OLR.

2723
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:18,000
Kitty!

2724
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:20,000
Alright, Kitty's gone, I'm sorry.

2725
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:22,000
That's okay, I have a midnight home.

2726
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:25,000
If you blow enough kisses, Sanrio might come out, we'll see. Just kidding, she hates people.

2727
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:27,000
She'll run away.

2728
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:30,000
She hates people, I'm sorry. Go take it personally with her.

2729
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:32,000
I know, I have cats sad enough.

2730
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:37,000
You should have seen her, Grandpa was over here yesterday and I brought her out to say hi. Oh, she was not happy.

2731
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:44,000
No, I have a midnight home, and Little Miss has been quite the affection whore today.

2732
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:49,000
Oh, I've got the picture in my email of Ranma's sake.

2733
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:51,000
Oh yeah?

2734
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:54,000
But you don't do shots of sake, you heat it and you sip it.

2735
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:57,000
It's taking forever to load.

2736
03:26:58,000 --> 03:27:06,000
Alright, well I'm looking at the Twitters, and a few of the things were things that I had already talked about,

2737
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:09,000
or that one of us had talked about earlier in the show with some of the news links.

2738
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:14,000
I do want to mention a tweet that came in earlier this week from Red the Haze, and I have to remember,

2739
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:18,000
I don't remember the context of this, but his tweet said,

2740
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:21,000
Gonna have to disagree with OLR Sky Dark Sakura.

2741
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:26,000
There were, are, a lot of military service members on WoW, many with clearances.

2742
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:28,000
Don't worry, I still love you guys.

2743
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:30,000
I saw that too.

2744
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:32,000
Yeah, I can't think that we would have come out here and said,

2745
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:38,000
Oh, military people don't play WoW, but maybe we had said something along the lines of, you know,

2746
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:41,000
that there isn't sensitive or sensitive people or something in there,

2747
03:27:42,000 --> 03:27:45,000
and that is a good counterpoint that, hell yeah, there's a lot of service members that play WoW,

2748
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:50,000
and a lot of MMOs. I mean, every MMO I've ever played, I meet service people in there.

2749
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:54,000
I think it's a great way for them to have some fun and let off some steam,

2750
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:57,000
and keep in touch with people as well.

2751
03:27:57,000 --> 03:28:01,000
So, thank you for reminding me to say thank you to all of our service people,

2752
03:28:02,000 --> 03:28:04,000
especially those that are having to spend the holidays overseas right now.

2753
03:28:05,000 --> 03:28:06,000
Thank you for your service.

2754
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:09,000
I think there's probably several that listen to this program, so thank you all.

2755
03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:13,000
Let me go to a tweet from Dave Falcon, who tweeted us saying,

2756
03:28:14,000 --> 03:28:20,000
The Smithsonian Museum of American Art started collecting video games as pieces of art for museum display.

2757
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:23,000
That's pretty cool, and he links us to a story from ABC7 News,

2758
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:25,000
and I'm trying to bring it up here.

2759
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:29,000
The Smithsonian American Art Museum is collecting video games for its permanent collection

2760
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:34,000
as part of an ongoing commitment to study and preserve such games as an artistic medium.

2761
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:39,000
Now, I thought that the Smithsonian already had a room for this.

2762
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:44,000
Or maybe I'm confusing it with another museum. Maybe it's MoMA.

2763
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:46,000
Maybe it could be.

2764
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:52,000
I swear somebody showed me a room, and I thought it was the Smithsonian, but maybe not.

2765
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:59,000
But regardless, they've acquired the 2009 game Flower, and the Halo 2600,

2766
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:04,000
which was the Halo hack that was done, or actually it wasn't really a hack,

2767
03:29:05,000 --> 03:29:07,000
it was like a homebrew game that was done a few years ago.

2768
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:09,000
It's kind of a neat little choice for inclusion,

2769
03:29:10,000 --> 03:29:14,000
but I think that's very cool to show a new game for an old console is pretty cool.

2770
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:16,000
I like that a lot.

2771
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:20,000
So yeah, hey, I think that's great to preserve that stuff as art.

2772
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:23,000
I think it's just a matter of time before we have a video game hall of fame.

2773
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:26,000
The Metreon tried to do something like that, but then they went kapoop.

2774
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:32,000
Well, remember too, though, there was that touring gallery that was a video game art,

2775
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:34,000
and I've got a couple books, actually, at home.

2776
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:38,000
Darth Tetsuya says the Smithsonian had that exhibit,

2777
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:41,000
so I guess this is more of a permanent installation there, so that's pretty cool.

2778
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:43,000
Alright, that is going to do it, though.

2779
03:29:44,000 --> 03:29:46,000
We've got to wrap up the show, because we're almost to 1am on the East Coast,

2780
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:49,000
so we really have to wrap up, so sorry to the tweets I didn't get to,

2781
03:29:50,000 --> 03:29:53,000
but if you have something for next week, please consider sending us an email, a tweet, or what have you.

2782
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:57,000
Mailbag at orangesoliderator.com or twitter.com slash OLR.

2783
03:29:58,000 --> 03:30:00,000
But it is that time for us to go around and wrap up for the night.

2784
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:03,000
Jason, thank you as always for being here throughout the month.

2785
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:05,000
As always.

2786
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:07,000
Glad we could have you participate with some stories tonight. Hope you had a good time.

2787
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:09,000
Not the first, won't be the last.

2788
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:11,000
Won't be the last, we'll see you, and it sounds like, by the way,

2789
03:30:12,000 --> 03:30:14,000
I don't want to give too much away, but I've been doing some texting.

2790
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:19,000
The OLR show in San Francisco, it's going to happen sooner rather than later.

2791
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:21,000
It's going to be one convenient Sunday for me.

2792
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:25,000
Yeah, and it will be a Sunday when you're here, so we have a weekend targeted,

2793
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:28,000
and I've been talking to Grandpa, so I think it's going to happen,

2794
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:30,000
so I will give you guys more details next week.

2795
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:32,000
I could give you guys a tour of my office while we're there.

2796
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:34,000
That would be fun. I think it would have a good time.

2797
03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:38,000
I look really, like there's some gaming people in San Francisco I think would really love to come to the show.

2798
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:41,000
I think we could really have a little party. That would be fun.

2799
03:30:42,000 --> 03:30:43,000
Poor Grandpa. We're going to take over his place for a night.

2800
03:30:44,000 --> 03:30:46,000
I probably shouldn't speculate so openly like this,

2801
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:55,000
but if there's a healthy number of people, like ten people either as guests or including the hosts,

2802
03:30:56,000 --> 03:31:01,000
we could probably host it in my office too, because we have ways of making this happen.

2803
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:04,000
We'll think of something. We'll have fun for a week.

2804
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:06,000
Ideas are a babbling.

2805
03:31:07,000 --> 03:31:10,000
Keep in mind Loki's not going to be available that week, so we can't have too much fun without him.

2806
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:12,000
We can't have too much fun without him.

2807
03:31:12,000 --> 03:31:16,000
There's also possibilities for bringing him on Skype and having his video on there too.

2808
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:18,000
That's true.

2809
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:20,000
These are not impossibilities.

2810
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:23,000
We'll see. Bobby Blackwolf wants to say, can I come? Of course you can.

2811
03:31:24,000 --> 03:31:25,000
Of course you can.

2812
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:30,000
Don't you want to try to convince Dark Sakura to come to Dragon Con and Loki to come to Dragon Con so we can have an OLR Dragon Con show?

2813
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:32,000
That would be even better.

2814
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:37,000
Alright, Dark Sakura. Oh wait, Jason, I've got to get your final thought. What's your final thought for the night?

2815
03:31:38,000 --> 03:31:39,000
Stupid cough.

2816
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:45,000
My final thought is, thank you Alan for getting Chinese food. It was really good. Usually that place is kind of so-so, but tonight was really good.

2817
03:31:46,000 --> 03:31:48,000
You need to tell Alan about you guys' present that I got you.

2818
03:31:49,000 --> 03:31:50,000
I did. I ran in there during the break.

2819
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:58,000
I'm hoping that Loki and Jason's presents arrive very soon, because I thought they were cool.

2820
03:32:00,000 --> 03:32:01,000
Your final thought tonight, miss?

2821
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:04,000
I want rotisserie chicken for dinner. I'm going to go to Walmart and buy a chicken.

2822
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:06,000
Yummy. Alright.

2823
03:32:06,000 --> 03:32:08,000
Dude, have you had the rotisserie chickens at freakin' Walmart?

2824
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:10,000
Uh, not at Walmart.

2825
03:32:11,000 --> 03:32:12,000
They're fucking amazing.

2826
03:32:13,000 --> 03:32:14,000
Really? From Walmart?

2827
03:32:15,000 --> 03:32:18,000
Yes. Because they're the same ones that, they're almost just like the ones from Costco. So good.

2828
03:32:19,000 --> 03:32:21,000
I would have thought maybe like Boston Market or something, but anyway.

2829
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:27,000
Alright, that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Have a great holiday, you guys. Whatever it is you celebrate.

2830
03:32:28,000 --> 03:32:35,000
We will be back here to do it all again for the last show of the year, so you know we're going to be talking games of the year, stories of the year, yep.

2831
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:40,000
We gotta have ourselves one of those shows, but a lot can happen in seven days, y'all.

2832
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:46,000
So we'll check in with the gaming news in seven more days here at Orange Lounge Radio. Have a great week, everybody.

2833
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:48,000
Is that seven days?

2834
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:51,000
Seven days. Seven days. Good night, everybody.

2835
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:54,000
