9577	12519	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
14219	18902	We're officially on the road to the holiday season and the lovable Third Street Saints are joining in the festivities with new DLC.
19162	23964	Also tonight, GamerX founder Matt Kahn joins us to talk about his Kickstarter for a Snatcher-inspired adventure game.
24144	27526	Your questions, comments, calls on the show where every video gamer has a voice.
28046	29007	Orange Lounge.
31909	36050	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice.
36130	37871	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
37911	38811	I just said that.
38911	44993	I know you did and I'm saying it again live on this December 1st, 2013, episode number 529.
45513	47633	Welcome to the show.
47653	55295	We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, and who knows what else with my co-host Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
55315	57556	Does that mean he said it dead and now he's undead?
58376	60117	He said it out of turn is what he said.
60237	60577	Fired!
61357	61937	It's fine, alright.
62097	62938	Blah.
63018	63538	How are you doing?
63558	64919	DarkSakura, we missed you last week.
64939	65419	Welcome back.
65639	68781	I wish I was here last week because it was fucking loud.
68961	69281	Yeah?
69742	73143	We went to this place called The Yard House, which we were discussing before.
74264	76665	Not like super fancy pants, but a little fancy.
77065	79787	I ate something incredibly non-kosher and it was delicious.
80487	82749	It was a surf and turf burger without the bun.
82889	84429	Well, and happy Hanukkah, Jamie.
84449	85770	Happy Hanukkah to me!
86451	89032	It is the fifth night I will be lighting my candles when I return home.
89252	92454	How did, uh, Hanukkah's giving, Hanukkah's giving or whatever Thanksgiving-ka?
92554	94396	Thanksgiving-ka, yeah, so how did Thanksgiving-ka treat you?
94416	103642	It was fucking loud too Um, okay, well we went, we went to, uh, have Thanksgiving dinner at, um, you remember Dan's buddy Adam, right?
103722	112388	Mm-hmm Uh, we went over there and there were the kids and Dan's cousins and brought the kids too And there was a bunch of people and fucking sports ball I hate sports ball
113008	114310	I hate sports ball.
114390	115231	Unless it's DDR.
115251	121839	And I say it with extra southern accent because all I heard about yesterday was Alabama Auburn, no one Kerr.
122219	124121	But you do love Tecmo Bowl, right?
124141	125323	Yeah, I guess.
125463	127846	There's some sports ball you can tolerate, I know that.
127866	128306	Yeah, some.
128567	130449	I used to date a rugby player and that was pretty awesome.
132689	136252	Also say hello as well to... Loki is here in studio.
136672	137633	How you doing, Techmaster Loki?
137794	138674	Doing fine.
138855	141437	Trying to figure out where these phantom stain spots came from.
141557	145101	It looks like something dripped on my pizza sauce.
145601	146582	It's not pizza sauce.
146702	147823	It's grease.
147984	150346	Well, it must be for the breadsticks, but they're not that greasy.
150586	152487	I mean, they are greasy, but they're not that greasy.
153047	155069	I didn't notice any grease dripping off of them.
155229	160552	So one of Loki's, you know, Loki always brings an interesting dining selection to the show.
160632	161772	And, you know, it's sometimes fast.
162173	166955	It's become a bit of a betting game amongst the live OLR listeners, what he brings to the show.
167015	169056	So tonight he brought his, he goes to the pizza place.
169076	169817	He doesn't get pizza.
169857	172758	He gets just a mass of breadsticks.
172919	174139	They are really good breadsticks.
174179	177561	So I will say if you have round table pizza in your area and you've had the breadsticks, they are really good.
178001	178562	I'm not going to lie.
179262	181063	It's probably oil or something.
181863	182083	Yeah.
182603	182863	Anyway.
183163	183823	It's cheese.
184184	184904	Cheese or something.
185264	185844	It's cheesy.
185964	188585	It keeps Loki cheesy, y'all.
189025	189965	It's not easy.
190525	195147	Also joining us in studio, I know you heard him a minute ago, and he is back this week.
195187	197848	Say hello to the voice of the show, Jason.
198068	198368	It's me.
198628	198928	Again.
199048	199428	Yet again.
199648	200369	Yeah, how you doing, Jason?
200509	200829	Doing good.
201089	201289	Yeah?
201990	202710	Been a good couple of days.
202750	203531	Been a good four-day weekend.
203571	204811	Did you have a good Thanksgiving as well?
204831	206472	I know you're... I did Friendsgiving.
206973	207093	Good.
207113	210795	Coworkers of mine invited me over, and there was about 20 of us.
211556	214918	Anybody that follows me on Twitter may have seen this story that I started to come up with.
215198	223123	A Twitter, Apple, Google, and GitHub employee sat around the table, and I don't really have a joke to fill into the end of that, but I'm sure there's one in there somewhere.
223283	224364	Some Silicon Valley...
225384	226724	Friendsgiving is a lot of fun
247109	249490	So, I'm... I heard you got super drunk.
249671	254453	I'm a little... Well, you must read my Twitter because I wrote some really stupid stuff last night while I was... No, no, no, no.
255014	256514	Grandpa posted it on Facebook.
256634	256855	Okay.
256935	260096	Well, you know me and my alcohol tolerance of which I have none, right?
260116	261037	Because I usually don't drink.
261077	262318	I'm usually the sober one.
262418	266260	But visiting Grandpa in the city, we were able to take cabs and all that stuff.
267480	268981	I had seven drinks last night.
271338	272980	and yeah, it was a lot of fun.
273380	278626	I'm good, I'm good, but I am feeling a little bit like if I'm dragging a little bit today, I blame that.
279066	281468	I blame Friendsgiving with drinks.
282109	282570	Good times.
283030	284031	Is that the new Zynga game?
285372	286333	Friendsgiving with drinks?
286413	287695	Possibly, possibly.
288055	289416	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
311758	319444	That actually has nothing to do with conventions, but it is kind of neat because it's inspired by an old, you know, we love old classic video games here at OLR.
319464	323167	Show of hands, who remembers the old video game Snatcher?
324195	324776	Who has Snatcher?
342550	344732	If he's going to be, I have to ask him about GamerX.
345152	346514	I want to know about GamerX too.
346614	348155	So we got to ask some of those questions.
348475	356022	So we will get to those questions and your questions live in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com in about 20 minutes or so.
356102	358624	But first, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that.
358664	360345	But I do want to get to a kickoff topic as well.
360385	363588	This one's a little bit more of a serious note.
363628	366931	This is housekeeping of sorts, IDK, what you want to call it.
366951	369413	But we got to talk a little bit about last week.
371821	373102	I thought we had a great show last week.
373142	374622	We had a lot of fun here on the show last week.
374642	375383	I wasn't here.
375443	376403	How could it be awesome?
376443	378404	Well, it wasn't our best ever, I'll be honest.
379665	381125	DarkSakura, it couldn't have been our best.
381145	382546	You need me to balance it out, huh?
382746	392730	But we did get feedback from multiple sources on last week's show that maybe felt that some of the discussion we had last week might have been a little bit off.
393310	400153	And so it is the show where every gamer has a voice, so I want to entertain some of this feedback and I want to kind of respond to it a little bit.
400793	401554	Uh, respectfully.
402475	408759	Um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna call this one out because it was publicly posted to our Facebook and by calling out I just mean I'm selecting it to read it on air.
408799	409800	Not like, I'm calling you out!
410120	410620	Back racks!
410640	411121	Three o'clock!
411241	411381	No.
411941	413402	Uh, because I do appreciate the feedback.
413442	414863	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
414883	416404	So I want to read this post that came to our Facebook.
416424	424950	It's from Carla O, is the name on Facebook, and it says, uh, I think I might stop listening to the show if it becomes PlayStation-centric, which it's starting to seem that way.
424970	425691	Uh,
426671	427391	That was the comment.
427411	434333	I was really trying to think, like, what in last week's show might have given the impression that we were PlayStation-centric?
434353	436434	And I was really thinking about it, and I was like, you know what?
437514	444856	In gaming culture as of late anyway, things have definitely seemed to be tilting in PlayStation's favor as a whole.
444916	448657	And I'm looking at the big picture here, and I'm trying to think, why is that?
448697	452258	Well, that's because Microsoft has been playing a little bit of a game of...
453078	455020	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
476200	477281	Every Gamer Has a Voice
501520	503422	And this is definitely a way I kind of feel in general.
504262	507865	If we go back to 2006, the roles were almost reversed.
508306	512869	I mean, coming out of E3 that year, Sony was the laughing stock of the entire gaming industry.
513270	518654	Giant enemy crabs, $599 US dollars, $599, like we all remember that, right?
519174	526740	And I know I've made this comparison on the show before, is that we're almost sitting in a place now where we're looking at like the complete flip of that.
527541	528081	and so on.
551067	560781	We believe that gamers should be able to once they buy the disc, the purchase is there.
561762	567270	He did that systematic dismantling at E3 of everything the internet didn't like about Microsoft.
568491	573614	and so that was an attack we haven't seen the likes of in a long time.
573854	576016	So that made things very interesting.
576276	576696	But anyway.
576816	578217	We don't even have to go back that far.
578277	582319	We just have to go back two weeks ago where you cancelled your PS4 pre-order.
583800	587021	True, but I don't necessarily blame Sony for that.
587181	593822	I just necessarily blame, and I think this is the boat we're all in right now of, we're just not ready for this next generation of game yet.
593902	595763	And it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.
596123	598083	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
598403	605705	And for me, personally, I look at what the PlayStation 4 has and what the Xbox One has and I say, eh, nothing there for me yet.
606768	610330	Dan and I swore off system and phone launches.
610690	615513	I'm getting my 5S at the end of the year instead of right when it came out.
616133	619796	We're probably getting our PS4 in February.
620436	625659	And we've pretty much decided that just because more stuff that we want to do is out on it and it fits in better with the things that we want to do.
626019	626559	End of story.
627020	632923	To tell you what train that I'm on, I'm on the TurboDuo train, 16-bit forever, hue cards, heck yeah.
634645	637428	So anyway, I wrote kind of a response along those lines.
637568	639390	Carla wrote back and I do want to read this here.
639790	643374	It says, but most of the negative criticism is focused on two out of those consoles.
643734	649421	I can understand everyone has their favorite console, but if the show focuses on all gaming platforms, it should reflect that in the show content.
649941	655265	Lately, there has been a ton of negativity thrown at one console, and that is pretty much what I hear in every other podcast.
655385	660328	OLR was the exception, but not as of late, which makes me sad because I enjoy this show more than most.
660448	661288	Thanks for the reply.
661669	662049	And you know what?
662089	663950	Thank you for engaging in respectful dialogue.
664430	669214	I really love these types of conversations as opposed to what you used to see in the old YouTube comments.
669594	671395	Fuck you, you fucking fuck, right?
672175	674757	So I really appreciate kind of the respectful dialogue there.
674777	675398	Okay.
676418	684700	As far as it goes, I can see where maybe last week, maybe kicking the Xbox the day after they launched maybe wasn't the most tactful thing to do.
685600	689241	But it's also kind of a realist view of where some people's heads are at.
689821	693822	And I say this in general, and I'm going to come back to this theme a little bit later on tonight.
694502	697243	I do like to think that we are fair to everybody.
697343	699304	There's going to be good days for gaming companies.
699344	701124	There's going to be bad days for gaming companies.
701644	705065	And we're part of that voice out there on the internet that talks about that.
705545	719101	and you know just like let's take Nintendo for an example we've talked a lot of Sony we've talked a lot of Microsoft we haven't talked a lot of Nintendo Nintendo absolutely has had their good days and their bad days and we've talked about you know we try to razz them both on this show for example bad days the swap note disabling what
721082	748852	that was you know and that just feeds into the whole Nintendo you do not understand online that whole thing right but then on the good side of Nintendo dude Nintendo released two game of the year contenders on the same day in the new Mario 3D world and Zelda Link Between Worlds that's a very good thing I mean those are game of the year contenders granted it's going to be a rough ride at the top when you've got Bioshock Infinite and Last of Us also this year but let's not neglect that those are two rock solid games that came out on the same day that's good news
749412	753836	So, you know, and I could think of cases for Sony and Microsoft as well.
755157	762903	I do want to encourage the listeners, you know, continue to, if you feel like your voice is not being represented, by all means, speak up.
763184	764505	We want to hear where you're coming from.
764565	771971	If you think that, you know, maybe we're neglecting something about the Xbox One that needs to be brought to the forelight, please continue.
772051	773391	Bring it up on the show.
773531	776112	I don't think we've ever said to somebody, you know what?
776492	777773	You're wrong in your opinion.
777793	779113	I like to think we haven't said that.
779373	786255	Maybe we sometimes riff on each other and yell at each other a little bit and maybe have said that, but we don't really want to tell people they're wrong.
786395	786595	Right?
786855	787175	Am I right?
788456	788756	Yes.
789116	792637	Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about Mass Effect, but... You know what?
792857	793297	Shut up.
793597	794057	You go to hell.
794077	794717	You're wrong.
794937	795518	You're wrong.
795838	797178	You can't deny a fact.
797218	798038	You are wrong on.
798298	799639	You cannot deny a fact.
801999	810421	Alright, but anyway, I might be dragging this out way too much, but I just want to say, guys, again, we're here to present some other perspectives.
810501	812762	And sometimes that's our perspective and sometimes that's your perspective.
812802	820864	And one thing I want to challenge our listeners to do, I don't think I got my thought out on this, is that, you know, sometimes in gaming we tend to live in this bubble.
822404	824325	and it's the way you see it.
824405	827107	And I'm not saying this particular listener is that way.
827127	827967	I'm not saying you.
828007	833370	I'm just saying in general, gamers, gaming, look at comments on websites and tell me you don't think this about some people.
833811	838573	Some gamers tend to live in their little bubble and they can't really see outside that bubble.
839073	841735	How could somebody possibly want an Xbox One?
841995	847098	How could somebody possibly want to spend $100 extra on this system with this device you don't need?
847118	847198	Well...
850037	851038	Look outside that bubble.
851138	852719	Maybe there's a reason.
852819	853880	Maybe there's that game.
853900	866071	And I'll tell you for me personally, next year is going to suck for my wallet because I'm going to have to buckle and get a PlayStation 4 when they release Final Fantasy XIV, the Elder Scrolls beta, the new Infamous looks really good.
866351	867672	You know, there's a lot of stuff on PlayStation.
867712	869554	Then on Xbox 360, guess what?
869594	873537	When they release a new Halo, when they release Quantum Break, I got to pick up an Xbox 360.
875439	877741	When they release all that, I gotta get an Xbox One as well.
877761	879161	So my wallet's gonna be hurting next year.
879201	881483	I'm just waiting for those games.
882123	882363	Alright.
883424	900255	I do want to introduce our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com and I'm trying to look at what some of the chatters are saying here.
900578	901939	We've been discussing physics.
903459	905641	So on task, apparently.
905961	909883	I'm seeing talk about gigantic monitors and whatever is going on there.
910023	915105	Because I said that I should be on NEC's payroll and someone asked if they still exist.
915405	916486	And then we started talking about their...
916846	917967	They made printers and stuff, right?
917987	926532	Yeah, but they made these great flat-screen CRT monitors that were perfect for doing color matching.
927153	929214	I mean, it was almost like a print match.
929234	930015	It was so great.
930175	932736	And, of course, you can't really get a CRT monitor anymore.
934037	937098	Um, let's see, SJ100Matt says, I remember the beginning of Last Generation.
937178	940319	OLR was accused of being anti-Sony, as a lot of internet was.
940800	943000	Uh, Brad says, uh, talk about what you know.
943060	947102	We bought the PlayStation 4 versus the Xbox One, so that is what we can talk about.
947462	950163	And you're right, we can talk about our particular reasons and so forth.
950823	959347	Um, and then, let's see, some folks in chat, some various people talking about kind of the whole Microsoft and what happened recently with some of the bans they were doing, which we're gonna get into a little later in the show.
960087	962728	Um, Loki, I, I, you know, again, you
963348	963989	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
983516	988778	I gotta say that sweet, sweet PlayStation 4 is a great value for this holiday at a retail price of $399.
988958	993079	You can find it... Okay, I just don't want to do that.
994099	995440	Because I'm not on their payroll.
995680	997140	I really wish I was.
997420	1002862	You don't understand how much that would be so awesome to have actual pay.
1004723	1004983	No, but...
1006909	1008350	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1029088	1030329	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1047746	1051870	Yeah, if you don't say anything, people are going to expect the worst, so that's kind of what it is.
1053872	1065322	Microsoft did it at the beginning of the Xbox 360 launch, kept playing down how many systems were affected by the Red Ring of Death or whatever, and people didn't believe them.
1065402	1070607	Yeah, I don't believe you that a small percentage of them are being affected by it when I've had six.
1070687	1070987	It's just...
1072528	1098347	It was ridiculous, so, I don't know, I think I'm harder than everybody And if I'm not, then I need to try harder You are, to be fair, you are pretty hard on everybody You said hard on Shut up, but, you know, it is kind of part of the reason I also see, you know, granted we had a lot of feedback to last week's show in that regard But I also get other feedback that's like, I live for Loki rants I am here for Loki rants, what pissed Loki off this week, I've gotta have a rant
1098687	1100829	So, you know, there's that on both sides.
1100849	1101750	Oh, there's been things.
1101870	1102611	Let's put it that way.
1103071	1105694	Well, we'll see what we're going to get to tonight in tonight's show.
1105734	1106995	But, again, I just wanted to respond.
1107275	1112140	And even though I only read one comment there because it was something public on Facebook, I just wanted to say there was other, like, chatter.
1112480	1119186	So, you know, I hope, you know, again, if you feel like there's a point that wasn't addressed, please, by all means, email the show, mailbag at orangeontrade.com.
1119206	1121849	You can post on Facebook as well, Twitter, and all that.
1122429	1124052	DarkSakura, you were out last week.
1124113	1125616	What have you been gaming on the past couple weeks?
1133350	1139936	Final Fantasy XIV, which every time I've logged on, no one's been on, so whatever Really?
1139956	1154589	Because I'm on a lot Well, it's during the day and you people have jobs I started my job, my contract work, so I'm very happy Actually, this is going to be a story, so maybe this will take the 10 minutes
1156130	1157912	Dan's birthday was Friday, on Black Friday.
1158192	1160835	And we were like, last week we need to do something really nice for Dan.
1160855	1163697	So I was trying to get people who wanted to get in to buy Dan a present with me.
1164178	1167561	And he had said, up and down, I don't want a download copy of Zelda.
1167681	1171585	I want the physical copy, so I'm not going to get the package, blah, blah, blah.
1172246	1172506	So...
1173687	1187035	Me and Becky and our cousin-in-law Hannah and George and Amanda all got together and we got the money together to order Dan a red 3DS XL and I bought him Zelda.
1187335	1188176	I went out and bought it.
1188976	1194780	Turns out, while I'm sitting in the bank trying to get my business bank account set up so that it can work...
1195720	1197222	Dan says, look what I bought.
1197603	1200727	Picture, gold, you know, 3DS.
1201348	1203651	And so I call him, I go, you are so stupid.
1204252	1208739	And this guy is like sitting next to me playing like Bejeweled on his phone and he's laughing his ass off.
1210561	1210862	Because...
1212163	1235619	and so anyway it ended up you know they just gave the monies for Dan to pay back what he paid on the thing and we kept a physical copy he gave the e-copy to George and I kind of thought like maybe you were gonna do something where you bought the Zelda one and then like you sold the code to somebody else who really wanted it or so I just kind of thought that's how things would go but I I like the way you guys did it for the record bones it actually was me because I was using Becky me in a subjective content and
1236619	1256469	context so you never end with you never use I as a subject I mean as a object there's a grammar throwdown going on in our chat room anyway don't you dare step to me in my grammar alright moving on come on I will conjugate you to death
1258411	1271703	Anyway, so as it turned out, George ended up picking up Fire Emblem for Dan, because Dan loves his Fire Emblem, and Dan's been playing... Crap.
1272263	1272844	I just forgot it.
1273024	1273945	Oh, Ace Attorney.
1274806	1278609	He's been really into it and hasn't been sleeping because he's doing the damn cases.
1280291	1280851	Also...
1284011	1284932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1305294	1327624	as far as other things I'm playing still playing the Stanley Parable off and on just so you know because there's so many different endings for it but I don't want it to get stale so I'm playing it a bit at a time I bought a game called the Shiva which is about a rabbi and it's it's a kind of a horror story from what it looks like or an investigative story so like a mystery and
1328084	1329467	So it looked interesting to me and it was cheap.
1330028	1334235	And then I bought some other game called 9.3M or something.
1334495	1335076	I don't know.
1335096	1335857	It was cheap too.
1336699	1336799	And...
1339212	1349915	I've just been trying to get through what's in my Steam library and I've got a few more things on my list so we'll see what happens but my goal is to play a different game every week that's in my Steam library.
1352015	1355976	That's a lofty goal because those Steam libraries build up quick.
1356617	1361558	Well, I've got enough games to play a different game every week for the next 10 years so I think I'll be good.
1361778	1362759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1378454	1395886	Matt Kahn is the founder of GamerX and he is behind a new Kickstarter for Read Only Memories, a new cyberpunk adventure.
1396267	1402311	So we're going to ask him about, you know, what's going on with GamerX and what's going on with this new game and how awesome is Snatcher and so forth.
1403011	1404092	And I believe Matt is there.
1404152	1404793	Matt, you on the line?
1405413	1405753	I am.
1405853	1406894	Hey, how you guys doing?
1406994	1407534	I'm great.
1407574	1408574	Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.
1408614	1409495	Matt, great to have you here.
1409915	1411656	Yeah, I'm super excited to be on the show.
1412216	1414017	I've really wanted to come on for a while.
1414337	1414937	Thank you.
1415137	1421000	Well, gosh, we should have had you on last time you had a Kickstarter to promote because I gave a lot of money to that Kickstarter.
1422220	1422600	Yay!
1422620	1425041	No, it was totally worth it.
1425121	1426822	And thank you for...
1427142	1428183	for putting that together.
1428284	1431007	And I know you have a whole team behind you and they all deserve kudos.
1431888	1435492	GamerX, I had a fantastic time at GamerX and that was a great experience.
1436093	1439517	And yeah, I can't wait for GamerX too.
1440178	1440698	Awesome.
1440758	1441880	I'm really excited to...
1443081	1444523	to have GamerX2 happening.
1444743	1458261	When we didn't get the original GamerX, we weren't sure if there would be the outcry for a second one, but people seem to have a really good time, so we're doing a second one and we're really excited about it.
1458817	1459538	Awesome, awesome.
1459718	1464021	If you guys have questions for Matt, you can join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
1464422	1474530	I got some questions of my own here, and I'm sure some of us here in studio also have questions for him, but I will be throwing in some of your questions as well as we talk about GamerX and your latest Kickstarter and so forth.
1475291	1477092	Let me ask you a couple things about GamerX.
1477412	1480055	So there is a GamerX 2, that is happening this year, right?
1480075	1480395	Yeah.
1480976	1481676	or this next year, 2014.
1483659	1488605	And I noticed one of the things I noticed right away, you're like, the new venue is three times as big as the old one, right?
1489218	1503103	Yeah, so people seem to really like the con last year, but I think that a lot of our first-time jitters showed off a little bit in that we definitely overbooked the hotel.
1503823	1512746	It was really crowded, and we don't want people to feel, especially with a crowd like we have, we don't want people to feel like it's claustrophobic or
1513486	1515607	We want it to feel super comfortable and super homey.
1516848	1528293	By going to the Intercontinental, not only are we choosing a spot that's really easy for people who live in the Bay Area to get to because it's right off BART and all the major muni lines, but also it's so much bigger.
1528333	1541179	It's three times the size that even if we grow even double the size of attendees, we'll have more than enough space to make sure they're all good and have a place to hang out and chill.
1541704	1544525	What would you say from this whole experience, start to finish?
1544585	1544845	What was...
1569329	1579127	what was the biggest lesson you learned that you could pass on to somebody else who's thinking about maybe starting something of their own in their town or something for whatever the cause is
1580711	1604657	You know, I think that, you know, we didn't, we, I don't know, because the thing that I feel like I've learned the most is that, you know, we went into GamerX, or the original one, without having, you know, any real convention experience behind us, and so we really overestimated the amount of, you know, major sponsors that were going to come in, and we spent a lot more money
1606036	1608077	and so on.
1608097	1621424	We were able to have a really awesome convention but we spent more money than we made which is okay but when you're running off, we don't have any venture capitalists or anything, going into the red is kind of a scary thing.
1622565	1632390	I wish I had done better budgeting and also been a little bit more realistic with the fact that because it was our first year, I think a lot of companies were scared to come on as
1635471	1642216	and also, we got a lot of people who were just kind of like, they were too afraid to kind of touch an LGBT thing.
1642996	1644097	It didn't really fit their brand.
1644978	1646298	Interesting.
1646459	1647319	Yeah.
1647659	1654984	Well now, okay, so unfortunately I know our own DarkSakura did not get to go to GamerX, neither did Loki, but DarkSakura's trying to make it at least this year, I'm hoping.
1655344	1655765	I hope so.
1655805	1657786	You gotta come do a panel with me, I had a ton of fun.
1658587	1662369	But, our buddy here in studio, Jason, actually went to GamerX.
1662669	1662970	I did.
1663050	1664871	And you are a straight male who went to GamerX.
1665131	1665691	Very much him.
1665991	1667052	Were you persecuted?
1667392	1672794	Because some of the comments you read on the internet are like, I was scared and offended.
1672894	1674154	No, not even a little bit.
1674194	1686639	I mean, the short version of this is that I was having a discussion about a month ago about the finer points, prejudices, and all this stuff, and I just kind of looked up and I said, screw the labels, be awesome to people.
1687039	1687960	That was the quick summary.
1688240	1688540	Absolutely.
1689260	1691662	I had a hell of a good time.
1691842	1693664	I was around plenty of people that I knew.
1694384	1695886	I met a couple people involved.
1696926	1702551	The guy that was doing visuals during the performances on Friday and Saturday night, I wound up having a conversation with him.
1703191	1707515	I took over the booth for my coworker so he could go out and get some lunch.
1707575	1708756	I was talking to people for 30-45 minutes.
1708796	1708936	It was...
1711057	1713118	as good as all the rest of the cons that I've been to.
1713278	1716939	Better, because it was even more... I go to anime cons, they're okay.
1717159	1720860	It was more gaming-centric and tech-centric to an extent, and I had fun with it.
1721240	1721580	Awesome.
1721680	1722840	Well, fun's what it's all about, right?
1723440	1730882	Looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, DKPopMan says, I want to go to a con, and Codeman says, I wish I could go to these cons.
1731462	1734863	Unfortunately, I know these guys don't live out here on the West Coast, so it's a little more of an investment.
1735443	1738864	Rama says, a lot of straight people go to YaoiCon, so...
1739484	1740145	Yes, they do.
1740545	1740906	All right.
1742367	1743228	So let's see.
1743308	1754598	I know you're really excited about Gamer X, Matt, but I know you also have this Kickstarter going on right now for this game ROM or Read Only Memories, which is a cyberpunk adventure.
1754978	1756360	Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?
1756920	1757540	Yeah, sure.
1757680	1760861	So at GamerX, we had a really great time.
1760941	1768724	And at the end of the GamerX, we had our kind of dead dog, like, hey, tell us what you hated or tell us your ideas.
1769464	1775206	And the thing that kept coming up in the question and answer was people were wondering when we were going to do a game.
1775266	1776587	They really liked our mascots.
1777607	1787435	and it got us to thinking about the fact that we have some really cool mascots and one of my big things is I don't believe in complaining.
1788636	1793521	I feel like I could go out and no disrespect to people that do do this but I could
1795362	1796984	Thank you for watching!
1811184	1814027	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1828400	1837648	and I think if it does well and we can show that to people, I think that we can kind of show the gaming world that see that there is an audience for it, it's not that hard to do.
1838769	1845114	If we could do it without any experience and just kind of starting from scratch, then you guys should be able to do it too.
1845394	1848337	And more selfishly, we want to make a game.
1848477	1849398	Who doesn't want to make a game?
1850779	1851099	I love that.
1851119	1860205	Well, yeah, I remember one of the very popular panels at GamerX was when one of the game designers got up there and said, all right, everybody, we're going to make a game right now.
1860245	1861126	You're all game designers.
1861146	1870412	And I thought that was a really awesome approach to it because I honestly looked at that and I went, oh, my God, I wish I thought to do that for podcasting because I'm so about getting more people to podcast in independent voices.
1870792	1872713	Why did – oh, that was such a good idea.
1872733	1874474	And I thought that was so awesome.
1874514	1875615	So, yeah, make games.
1876035	1876976	You should do that next year.
1877897	1878857	I darn well might, Matt.
1879898	1880218	and more.
1904440	1905381	Sorry, Luke McCampbell.
1906262	1916850	And they actually built a system where we actually, me and the people who are non-technical, who are writing the story for the game, we're actually writing out all the story stuff in Twine.
1916991	1923056	And they actually built an engine, a tool that will actually translate the Twine script into Unity.
1923776	1951932	so that way and then so you know once the game comes out we're actually going to put that tool up and that's going to become available for people to you know like use and like other people to like use so hopefully it'll be easier for people who make Twine games to make visual Twine games that is a fantastic benefit to this Kickstarter that I want to make sure we call out here and kind of highlight is that you know if this is successful and you're able to put all that together that can be huge for other people wanting to do this right?
1952572	1953112	Yeah, yeah.
1953473	1959737	I mean, it's one of those things where, like, we, I think that there's a lot of people who want to be able to make games like this.
1960837	1963279	And, like, I have no idea how to program.
1963299	1964379	Like, I can't program at all.
1964880	1976307	And the guys who are making the programming of the game on our end, like, they're pretty much building out these systems so that way they can go, here we go, here's the, like, they're basically making an RPG maker.
1976807	2000454	you know like basic system for me so I can just go in and change the text you know add in what characters I want to have in what places so that way they don't even like I don't even need their help to make the game happen and once we have that there like you know I feel like there's so many great stories that should be told that I think Twine's great but it'd be cool to be able to show some of those stories in a more visual way.
2000973	2013622	Well, obviously, when you talk about the visual and the presentation of the game, there's many references in your Kickstarter, on the Facebook and so forth, to the gaming classic Snatcher, which I know we here at OLR are very familiar with.
2014382	2016444	We love Hideo Kojima and the things he's done.
2017004	2019686	And you talk about this in the Kickstarter and so forth.
2019806	2028452	What is it about that particular game that basically makes it the framework or inspiration or whatever you want to call it to tell your own story that you're writing?
2028472	2028632	Yeah.
2030238	2033560	I mean, well, Snatcher's definitely in my top five games of all time.
2034641	2044888	And looking at, you know, those top five games, Snatcher seemed like the one that would be, you know, just from a more realistic perspective of, like, what could we actually build with a small team?
2045368	2052113	And, you know, a point-and-click adventure is something that we're like, okay, that's something that we could definitely do and not overreach.
2053233	2058357	But it was also something where the setting of it, which is, you know,
2058897	2059678	Deep in the Future.
2059798	2063640	In Snatcher, it's 50 years in the future, so it's in the same vein.
2063680	2064760	We're 50 years in the future.
2066761	2081729	We can look at the way that the dynamics of queer culture have changed in that back in the 20s, back in the 30s, if you had a kid and he was dating an Irish kid or an Irish girl or whatever, you'd be like, oh, you can't date those Irish.
2081749	2082690	You can't date the Polish.
2083350	2086791	All that shit that by the 60s or 70s, no one even cared about that.
2086891	2091052	And then in the 60s and 70s, you couldn't date out of your own race and things like that.
2091172	2094252	And then people kind of – those people died off.
2094692	2100193	And now people are upset about people being trans or genderqueer or being gay or lesbian.
2100253	2104794	And I think as people get over the gay and lesbian thing, they'll start getting over the trans and genderqueer thing.
2105214	2106475	And I think that by 2064, hopefully –
2108995	2124487	Most characters in the game will have kind of gotten over a lot of those things and so you'll see a lot more gay and lesbian and queer and trans characters that are in positions of power or positions where they're not on a different social class as they're like...
2125288	2125508	and so on.
2149116	2153280	They're not just there because they're queer, and they're not going to be just good people because they're queer.
2154301	2155802	Was that possibly a hint to the plot?
2155922	2161327	Because I picked up on, I know this is in the future, and you've got robots in this game, and you just said, I don't want my daughter to date a robot.
2161347	2162087	Is that a little hint there?
2162107	2163408	Yeah, so there's a couple...
2165270	2168012	So there's a couple things that we want to introduce in the game.
2168492	2172955	There's definitely going to be people who are going to be cybernetic.
2173056	2180741	There's these devices called ROMs, and these ROMs can be... We've only shown off how Turing looks, but ROMs can be really any size.
2180761	2183283	They can be like a wristband, they can be whatever.
2184344	2186025	Because in the future, we're not going to really...
2186565	2187005	and so on.
2213823	2219785	Man, on the internet, there's all these people who... It's a better life than the real world.
2219905	2220646	That's very true.
2220906	2221626	That is very true.
2221646	2224707	It's going to be interesting to explore that.
2225288	2231510	One of the things that I really want to explore with the game is... I come originally from the tech world, and I saw how...
2234211	2234491	and so on.
2250136	2268424	and you know like I think we're already kind of starting to see it but it'll be interesting to kind of be able to talk about that and actually have a little bit of experience of like knowing some of the people who are actually like kind of putting these processes into place now and knowing kind of what they dream the future to be and and
2269264	2270445	DarkSakura, you have something to throw in?
2289815	2297685	I was just saying, I was thinking about a little bit of Shadowrun without the extra fantasy elements that Shadowrun throws in.
2298586	2300808	I was actually getting a big hint of Rifts too.
2301649	2303832	I don't know if you ever did any tabletop RPGs.
2305598	2307699	I've played a little bit of Shadowrun.
2308219	2313701	It's definitely something where we want to keep it very close to that cyberpunk niche.
2313721	2326645	You're going to see a lot of things that are... If you watch Blade Runner, Snatcher, Rise of the Dragon, anything that is cyberpunk-y, we're going to try to keep that as much as possible.
2327546	2328026	While...
2328766	2329487	and so on and so forth.
2352710	2364762	and it'll be interesting to see but also apply kind of a lot of that cyberpunk CRT monitor FM sounds you know like make it feel very 80s and a little backwards at times too
2366076	2369999	Once again, the Kickstarter is for a game, ROM, Read Only Memories.
2370019	2376283	If you want to check that out, unfortunately, Kickstarter doesn't really have short URLs, so I would encourage you to just search for that, Read Only Memories.
2377064	2382107	You can also back this, and some of the rewards include just for $6, it looks like.
2382487	2388271	So for $6, we'll get you the unlock code for the full version when it's released on OUYA or Mac and PC.
2388951	2395236	Some of the other rewards, $20, this is the one that I actually personally did, where you can get your name, company, or website in the credits,
2395976	2399481	I wanted to give a little OrangeLawnsRadio.com love in the game.
2399721	2400482	Alright, I gotta ask.
2400502	2401003	Why the OUYA?
2402424	2405307	Oh, so, well, the cool thing is that they're going to double our money.
2405847	2406367	Oh, okay.
2406668	2407068	Makes sense.
2407528	2418598	Basically, you know, all that we have to do is that when we launch the game, we're going to release it on Mac and PC, and if we hit a stretch goal, also Linux, and then also OUYA at the same time.
2418618	2420439	So we're going to release on all four of those platforms.
2420780	2421060	That's right.
2421080	2427986	I forgot that they opened that up to where you can also publish on PC to be qualified for their, you know, fun of the games or whatever they call the thing.
2428426	2433671	Yeah, so we're going to release that game, and we're going to release it on Steam and PC and Mac and OUYA all at the same time.
2434112	2453090	And then in the six months between when we release it on those systems and then we release it on iOS and Android, we'll spend those six months making sure that we fix any bugs that may have been in the original releases, making it suitable for touchscreen interfaces, making improvements specifically for mobile.
2453570	2478489	so like in actuality it's you know like it'd be cool if we could release it all at the same time but we can actually use that time to make it better and yeah I mean like it's free money and it's something where like I'm a big fan of the idea of the OUYA like I like the Android platform I like the idea of people can create anything and put it up there I mean I know they've made a lot of PR mistakes and I know that they're not like beloved by everyone and
2479293	2487482	We knew that it wasn't going to be the best PR decision to do it, but I still believe it's a good idea.
2487862	2497552	I think that's the kind of system that our game would actually be perfect for, where a long-term story-based adventure game doesn't really exist on that system.
2499314	2500975	I think that that might be something that people would be into.
2501836	2509840	I want to get to some of the chat room questions that we have too because we have a few questions in chat and I have a couple of other questions I want to ask though.
2510260	2513642	One of them here about the music in the game because I definitely noticed this.
2513662	2520265	You have some artists who agreed to help out with the game, Aethernaut, Vert, some names that people ought to know.
2521205	2522786	What kind of soundtrack do you try to make with this game?
2523713	2540212	Um, you know, so one of the things that was really cool about Snatcher was that, although, like, it was a very, very simple game, like it was just text, you know, select text, select text, menus, um, it had really, really awesome visuals, but more importantly, because it ran on Sega CD, it had really amazing music, um...
2540952	2544295	and it was, you know, the music was way out of proportion for the visuals.
2545036	2552523	And in the same way, like, we want to have very kind of simple, kind of very, like, 80s, 16-bit visuals, but we want really, like, awesome music.
2552963	2562072	And so music has been one of the things that we wanted to focus on from the beginning is, you know, getting really awesome artists who want to come and be involved with the game and
2563212	2569075	We actually just released yesterday on our Kickstarter update a style sheet of some of the songs that really influence us.
2570355	2577378	Some of those include games from these PC-88, the UNO field stage, and Shin Megami Tensei IV.
2577878	2586581	Just all these FM synthy, it's kind of hard to explain, but if you check out the list, we have just some of the music that inspires us.
2588442	2603929	Aethernaut and Vert and 2Mellow and all these people that we're working with, they just really dug the vibe and I think a lot of them were big fans of Snatcher growing up and they were really into the idea of giving it a try to making something cyberpunk-y.
2604619	2630600	Alright, I got one more question for you and then we're going to go to some of our chat questions at live.vognetwork.com It's not too late to get your question in if you have a question for Matt Kahn with GamerX and Read Only Memories Matt, I ask this of everybody who comes on this show to pitch a Kickstarter so I'm going to ask you as well The funding you're trying to raise for this $62,064 which is kind of a funny number but what do you need that money for?
2630700	2632222	Where is that money going to ultimately go?
2632842	2633062	Sure.
2633202	2634724	So a couple of things.
2634764	2637425	So we're working with a team of seven people.
2638866	2640307	Myself, I'm producing the game.
2640408	2642609	We have John James, who's our lead artist.
2643750	2645511	We have – I'm sorry.
2645551	2646932	Let me actually make sure I don't get anyone's names wrong.
2647272	2648693	Luke McCampbell and –
2649754	2678712	Ted Danola, they're programming the games Ted Danola is he used to work at Zynga and Puppy Punch Productions and he's like super duper legit and he's leading up the programming side of things and so we've only started really getting this programmed over the last couple months and things have been ramping up super quickly with him and then we have Tumelo and we have Fred and we have all these other people who are working on the music and especially with people like Aethonaut and Vert like
2679412	2684654	I could get them to give us a good deal on music, but I'd rather that they get paid a fair amount for their work.
2686314	2690175	I want to make sure that everyone gets a fair amount to work on this game.
2690735	2699478	Between all those people, and then we also have Shams, who's our CFO, mid-boss, and who's going to be doing all the fulfillment and stuff, it's a lot of work.
2700078	2702619	The money is mostly going into paying those people.
2703059	2705060	Then there's also the Unity fees.
2706720	2709803	The actual distribution fees of getting those games out there.
2710223	2712504	And then just paying for it.
2712524	2713525	I want to have more music.
2713585	2715747	I want to have more artists come on board.
2716107	2718449	And I want to make sure they get treated right.
2718729	2720310	And I do notice you have some stretch goals.
2720530	2729737	Hopefully, if you can get there, provide an actual soundtrack, OST, if you've backed up a certain level, a Linux port, and possibly an art book at different stretch goal levels.
2730077	2732559	But we are looking at 11 days to go.
2732599	2733399	And you've got about 20K to go.
2734560	2739542	So you're on track, but every little bit helps, especially meeting those stretch goals.
2740102	2746165	If you guys are listening here at vognetwork.com or on the podcast feed or on Stitcher, I definitely encourage you guys to check this out.
2746685	2748766	You can keep tabs on Matt's projects.
2749246	2751747	Gamerconnect.com would probably be the best place to send them.
2751807	2754168	I'm not sure where your hub is for all this.
2754528	2784098	yeah well I mean we're actually making a bunch of changes right now because like you know we now that we're not just doing GamerX we're now kind of reforming as mid-boss in a way so now we have a game and we have the convention we're working really hard on GamerConnect.com to get it up to like being something really awesome but it's just really tough because like it's basically we're trying to emulate a lot of features that Facebook has and it's just hard with one person you know programming it to keep it up um
2784358	2811770	but we actually just released a new news feed today and we really want it to be a place where if you're a queer geek you can go and talk about games and relax and we just need to put more work into it and make sure that it runs fast and looks good part of that is we don't really have the money yet to hire people to do that so if you go to GamerConnect it has all of our projects GamerX2 is next July and you can get your tickets now
2813090	2841592	and also one of the cool things about Read Only Memories is you can actually get tickets for GamerX2 in the rewards for the Kickstarter and so for the $79 level that's only $9 more than a regular 3 day ticket and then for that you get 3 copies of the game you get the beanie, you get the stickers and you get a ticket to the con and that money gets doubled for us because of Ouya so you're helping us out too so it's a good deal
2842092	2842332	Awesome.
2842352	2845795	Well, Matt, I hope we're not taking up too much of your time, but I do want to get some chat questions, if you don't mind.
2845835	2847316	Just a couple of questions here.
2847376	2853140	DungeonBuster in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, asking, will ROM have action sequences like in Snatcher?
2853540	2856822	As good as Snatcher is, I think it could have stood well enough without them.
2857103	2859844	And if you do have them, will there be an option to skip them?
2861005	2864469	Yeah, so I don't want there to be action sequences.
2866331	2872437	I didn't mind the action sequences in Snatcher.
2872457	2873979	I actually thought that they were okay.
2875561	2879645	If you've ever played Policenauts, which is sort of like the spiritual sequel in a way to Snatcher...
2881896	2884238	I did not enjoy the action sequences in that.
2884278	2889362	With Snatcher, they had the grid format.
2889923	2893166	They totally ditched it for Policenauts, and they just expected you had a light gun.
2894567	2897850	So it was impossible to play as an emulation or without the gun.
2897870	2898891	Yeah.
2899571	2906754	And then with Rise of the Dragon, it just has the worst, awful, just disgusting arcade elements you've ever seen in your life.
2907654	2917758	It's got this really cool gameplay, and then you go into the arcade elements, and your character, when he jumps, he jumps like 30 feet in the air, and it's disgusting.
2918438	2921259	If you play it, you would be sick to your stomach.
2923220	2939981	So that being said, we also don't have a ton of experience with... This is a pretty new team, and we have two really awesome programmers, but I've seen what we're doing with the dialogue and inventory and how we're working on that, and I feel like...
2941323	2944604	I don't want to shoehorn anything in that isn't going to feel natural to the game.
2946185	2953127	If there is going to be minigames, it would probably be more around like, hey, you need to move these wires around to unlock this puzzle.
2953847	2960729	So I would think that it would be more around puzzle stuff and things that aren't time-based or whatever.
2961729	2970512	Because I've usually found that in adventure games, action scenes, while they're fun and they kind of keep you on your toes, can be really, really frustrating.
2971652	2988642	and not very fun because it can be a blockade to progress the story too which I can totally see that element of it like how many times of like forget it I can't get past this one thing in the game forget it I'm out I'm out and then you know you would miss the story so I totally hear you on that
2989963	2991124	One more question here from chat.
2991144	3001774	This is a question about GamerX from SSJ100 Matt in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com asks, I understand this is still very new, but what do you see as the future of GamerX?
3001895	3002896	What is the next step?
3003036	3005758	Because this is a great idea that I could see growing even more.
3006799	3009402	Yeah, I mean, the whole plan for GamerX
3011494	3016077	We recently appointed a new president whose name is Tony and they are awesome.
3017858	3027324	And the idea for GamerX is like when we first created it and when I first created SFGamers, I wanted there to be a safe space for other gay and queer gamers like myself.
3027985	3033909	And I kind of used the word gamer because I kind of always kind of thought that was a really super inclusive word.
3035249	3062359	but the more I've kind of met people I've realized that the name is kind of in a way it can be a little off-putting to straight people who want to come and people who want to come who aren't necessarily gay identifying and I don't want the con to be something where people feel uncomfortable going because of the name or even because of the vibe I want the vibe just to be a place where anyone, no matter whether they be genderqueer or straight or a furry or an ally or
3062699	3064981	Trans, or Bai, or just a woman.
3065401	3082793	Anyone who maybe feels like they aren't culturally accepted by the mainstream gaming media to be able to come and feel like they're on an equal level playing field where people aren't going to judge you because of some preconceived notions of like, oh, well, you're a girl, so you can't play games, or you're gay, you can't play games, or whatever.
3082893	3088157	I mean, I think you look at players like Scarlet, who almost just won the world championships for StarCraft.
3089918	3095484	and, you know, who's a trans woman and it's like, obviously, women and queer people can play games.
3096125	3104594	You know, I want it to be a place where everyone's treated with respect but I want it to also be a place where, like, if you're a straight person, like, I'm sick of people being like, oh, I can't go to this because it's a gay event.
3104674	3105775	I'm like, no, it's like,
3106596	3108038	It's not really like that.
3108078	3122513	It's more like almost – and I even hesitate to compare it to this but like an LGBT film festival where it's like you might see some films that have queer content in them or you might have conversations that talk about some gay stuff.
3123014	3127138	But like for the most part, it's a gaming convention and I think that you'll find that most gamers –
3128079	3130481	care more about games than anything else in their life.
3130761	3138747	But that being said, the gays and the queers of us also deserve to be able to feel comfortable and be able to flirt with one another in a safe environment.
3139959	3144701	An interesting response here from Queen Simeon, our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, there's that.
3145021	3150363	And I thought personally, if I attended GamerX as a straight cis woman, I'd be invading a safe space.
3150503	3152323	I don't think that's the case at all.
3153004	3154204	No, no.
3154304	3163527	I mean, like, you know, we actually had Anita Sarkeesian was there and we had a ton of really awesome women who came and were just, you know, regular cis, not regular, just, you know, cis women.
3163807	3164448	Yeah.
3164788	3166508	And, you know, they actually really enjoyed it.
3166568	3168229	And like, I feel like
3168909	3187904	It's something where it's kind of almost comparable to a gay club where it's like a lot of cis women go to gay clubs in San Francisco because they know that they'll be in a safe space where they know that they'll be treated with respect and they're not going to be groped on or hit on unnecessarily and just be able to dance and have fun.
3188464	3189205	In the same way, it's
3191527	3199972	I think we as gamers, and by that I mean queer gamers, we don't want other people to not come.
3200152	3202814	I think that we want people to acknowledge who we are.
3203655	3211480	I think the more that people acknowledge that we are an existing group and that we're just like you and everyone else, that's really, really important.
3212360	3222470	because I don't subscribe to that whole idea of we're making GamerX to make a seclusionary event and you should only go to GamerX and don't go to PAX or don't go to E3 because that's silly.
3222810	3229457	People can go to as many conferences as they want or can afford to go to and this is just a different experience.
3229597	3231158	We're trying to create something that's
3234381	3235502	Not really out there right now.
3235522	3244069	Yeah, you know, I gotta say, Matt, as somebody who, you know, for a period in my late teens and early 20s, I literally thought I was the only gay nerd.
3244249	3247352	Like, I thought I was the only gay nerd on the whole damn planet.
3247792	3254017	So to now, you know, maybe now I'm in my mid-30s, but to see something like this happen was really amazing, Matt.
3254097	3258020	And I gotta thank you and your team for doing this because I'm like, oh my god.
3258140	3260062	And I'm speaking from experience here, you guys.
3260502	3285929	like to be that 18 or 19 year old who is thinking that like I am the only gay nerd on the entire planet to be to be shown like no you're not you're the only gay nerd in the village but but no you're not and to have to kind of have that celebration not just like look other gay nerds but a celebration of all things nerd is just I it meant a lot to me personally and I was so happy to see it happen
3286569	3287230	Thank you.
3287250	3289273	That's kind of my whole goal with it.
3289353	3290554	I think back to my...
3291950	3321000	16 year old gay nerdy self and like how much of the time I would either hang out with gay people and I would like have to hide being a nerdy or I would hang out with nerdy people and have to hide being gay and I felt like I was living a lesser life than my true self and I feel like if people can look at GamerX and see there's thousands of other queer geeks out there just like them hopefully they won't feel like they're alone they feel like you know the whole point of creating GamerConnect was so that way people can you know can connect with their community and find other people in their community and like
3321780	3328065	I remember being in college and finding GayGamer.net and being like, this is what I've been looking for my entire life.
3329786	3334050	I felt like if I can help other people find that, that's my calling in a way.
3335030	3336291	Jamie, you have one more thought here?
3336511	3338013	It wasn't a very big thing.
3338553	3340715	I was actually just wondering how the asexual turnout is.
3341929	3344831	Um, you know, we, so we don't obviously ask people at the door.
3345091	3347272	Well, I mean, I was just wondering if there was representation.
3347692	3348052	Oh, yeah.
3348133	3354536	I mean, so the thing is that, like, uh, we try to accommodate, like, everything in terms of, um, like, panels.
3354556	3370745	Like, I don't remember exactly what panels we had last year off the top of my head, but I know that we had panels that, that, um, I know for sure that we had panels that were submitted about, like, you know, being asexual and being in the community and, you know, as someone who, I dated someone who was asexual, um,
3371886	3378250	I obviously don't think that there's any lifestyle that isn't valid, but I totally understand and I want that.
3378510	3386856	I think a lot of people have a lot of ignorance about people who are asexual and I think that more education along those lines would be great.
3387656	3399444	Although I can't speak to the attendance of it at that level, I would love to see more panels by people who either identify as asexual or want to talk about asexual ideas, especially as they pertain to gaming at GamerX too.
3399504	3400785	I think that would be super duper awesome.
3401505	3430090	it's funny I actually did have an idea for a panel you better write that down asexuality and shipping why it's a nightmare so yeah you know GamerX definitely a celebration of diversity and I think it's only going to be a bigger celebration in this next year Matt I wish you the best of luck with GamerX too and your team as well I know Tony is leading it now and it will be fabulous with the group that you helped assemble last year I know it
3430610	3452232	and of course with this game Read Only Memories A New Cyberpunk Adventure please check it out on Kickstarter take a look at the video and let's see if we can't help Matt raise that $20,000 more they need to get it to happen Matt before I get any last plugs from you and let you go I do have to ask you about one other topic that's completely different like you were not prepared to talk about this you ready?
3452632	3453292	Yeah, I got it.
3453412	3453773	All right.
3453933	3456394	Okay, I'm going to bring it because here's the thing.
3456794	3460835	Now, DarkSakura, she doesn't watch a lot of reality television.
3460955	3461396	No, I don't.
3461536	3467498	But there is a show in Britain about Britain's worst driver, and they adapted it in Canada.
3467938	3469819	And you love yourself some Canada's worst driver.
3469919	3471420	I love Canada's worst driver.
3471460	3478963	Did you know that Matt, and this is on Wiki, so I know it's true, Matt was a contestant on America's worst driver.
3479183	3479643	Really?
3479663	3479743	Yeah.
3480083	3482366	and Matt, am I correct?
3482467	3485471	Now, spoiler alert, Matt, you won the whole damn thing, didn't you?
3485831	3487634	Yeah, I am America's worst driver.
3490012	3495276	Now, I haven't watched the American one just because I heard that it was like way too Americanized.
3495736	3497978	Because the Canadian one is just awesome.
3498358	3501621	It's like we teach you how to do stunt driving and you have to do all this.
3501941	3502601	It's very polite.
3502782	3505303	Yeah, well, it is really... Well, I don't know.
3505323	3509406	There's this one girl who's kind of freaking out on... They're doing Worst Driver Ever this season.
3510067	3511828	But what was it like for you?
3511848	3513690	I mean, was it embarrassing to be on it?
3513790	3515571	Or did you learn something from it?
3516812	3518233	No, the thing is that like...
3518393	3522314	You know, at this point, I don't really care what the Travel Channel does to me.
3522814	3524554	I mean, so the whole thing was all scripted.
3524954	3525354	Oh, yeah.
3525654	3534656	So, like, each city that we went to, they would be like, okay, so the rules were, there was eight, okay, so all scripted is maybe not exactly correct.
3534816	3536237	So there's eight cities that they would go to.
3536697	3542418	And in each of the cities, they said, okay, so there's going to be four contestants, and the worst driver in the city would have their car destroyed.
3542438	3542778	Uh-huh.
3543038	3548584	However, those contestants would then be brought back for the finale where seven out of those eight teams would win brand new cars.
3549385	3554510	So basically they're telling you to lose so that way you'd have a seven out of eight chance to win a new car.
3555757	3564748	So in each of the cities, it's super fake because all eight episodes, everyone's trying to do the worst thing possible.
3565609	3575101	And I was just able to win in San Francisco because I had a really crappy car, and so I was willing to basically total it on the show either way.
3576512	3578312	So I was just totally breaking all the rules.
3578352	3580753	I was driving down Lombard Street and crashing into shit.
3581893	3582853	And I was having a blast.
3582893	3587634	If you watched the first episode, the first episode in the finale, the first episode I'm having so much fun.
3587794	3589575	I'm actually like I'm never tripping at all.
3589935	3591175	I'm just like, yeah, this is great.
3591555	3592415	I'm having fun.
3592915	3599117	And then in the finale, then it was like actually a real contest where they would have like elimination style challenges.
3599737	3600017	Yeah.
3600817	3604642	It's something where they never let you watch the other people compete and they don't have any times.
3605022	3606484	They just be like, yeah, you won or lost.
3606905	3616096	And someone during my SF things actually carried a stopwatch in their pocket and the time that they got was completely different than the thing they had in their pocket.
3616116	3619420	Which meant that they were like, yeah, this whole show is fixed.
3620382	3627848	Anyways, fixed or not, in the finale, I watched as there's eight teams, and I'm super confident.
3627888	3630330	I'm just like, yeah, I'm not a bad driver.
3630350	3631632	There's no way I'm going to lose to all these people.
3632132	3635675	I watched it go from eight teams to seven teams to six teams to five teams.
3636176	3639699	I watched my expression, and I was wearing demon horns in the first episode.
3639859	3641701	I'm super fun and having fun.
3641721	3644263	By the time there's three teams left, I'm like, shit.
3644363	3645204	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3667305	3668747	It's just pretty obvious.
3668807	3676037	It's two little shithead kids versus this really sweet older women.
3676117	3677218	Not older, but you know.
3677819	3681384	There are people who didn't deserve to lose versus two brats.
3681944	3682065	And
3683666	3687868	It was just, you know, I think I knew that like storyline wise we were going to lose.
3688048	3700912	I was panicking and I wasn't driving well and I lost and then they were like, oh, we're going to, the Robosaurus is going to destroy the new car of the person who lost and then so destroyed the car that I would have gotten.
3701072	3702752	Did they have Robosaurus in Canada?
3702913	3706113	No, this is completely different than the Canadian version.
3706994	3712615	In the Canadian version, they basically pick eight drivers from around the different provinces who can't drive for a different reason.
3713295	3714776	And then they actually go through driver rehab.
3715836	3720177	And if you get voted off, that means you actually were a good driver when you graduated rehab.
3720557	3723218	If you win the whole thing, that means you are the worst driver.
3723998	3726139	You get a trophy of crashed car parts.
3726559	3729061	Yeah, so we didn't get any training or anything.
3729242	3734186	We just had the first episode, and then they were like, come back for the finale, and they never gave us any training.
3734206	3735307	They just were like, eh.
3735767	3738870	It just seems like the only similarity is the name then.
3739291	3740151	Maybe, maybe.
3740231	3748379	Well, I know it has nothing to do with video games, but knowing that DarkSakura loves her Canada's Worst, I had to ask you about that.
3748679	3750060	And I even see some comments in the chat room.
3750080	3752783	Codeman says, I've never watched this, but it sounds awesome.
3753463	3756147	It was cancelled after one season.
3756407	3757889	It was the worst show.
3757949	3758710	It was so bad.
3758730	3760812	I knew while we were filming it it was going to be cancelled.
3762294	3763175	It was so bad.
3763555	3765357	I love that you have a great sense of humor about it though.
3765377	3771064	I just wonder if they had kept the original format if it would have lasted because it's on its 8th season in Canada now.
3771144	3771745	We'll never know.
3772345	3773146	I bet you they would have.
3773266	3778151	I mean, the thing is that when they were filming it, I could tell it was going to be really bad, and then I found out the time slot.
3778171	3779793	It was like Saturdays at 10 p.m.
3780554	3781234	Travel Channel.
3781314	3783617	I was like, man, they have no confidence in this show.
3784958	3788742	See, I've actually learned stuff watching the Canadian version, and I know Canadian road signs now.
3790279	3791259	Are they that different?
3791439	3792880	There's some that are different.
3793100	3794560	Alright, Matt, we gotta let you go.
3794861	3796581	Thank you so much for having a good sense of humor about that.
3796941	3797922	And seriously, I mean it.
3798022	3801703	I am so looking forward to GamerX 2 and everything your whole team's putting on.
3801803	3803944	And best of luck with read-only memories.
3804044	3804604	I hope you make it.
3805323	3806404	Thank you so much for having me on.
3806484	3807665	I'd love to chat more.
3808926	3810287	Please check out Read Only Memories.
3810347	3813809	We still have tickets to GamerX2 on there that are super cheap.
3814330	3818172	If you back it on there, then we are going to basically double your money.
3818272	3820494	You're going to make a really awesome game on top of it.
3820874	3821135	Awesome.
3821155	3830268	Well, best of luck to you guys, and yes, let's keep in touch, and I will see you at least at GamerX2, if not a heck of a lot sooner, because I'm in San Francisco all the time.
3830949	3834053	Yeah, we'll get some really nice ethnic food.
3834073	3836556	We'll go get some Peruvian food down in...
3838760	3841762	and then you can watch me have seven drinks like I did last night and make a fool out of myself.
3843463	3845364	Alright, Matt, buddy, take care and good luck.
3845744	3846664	Alright, man, have a great day.
3846724	3847405	Alright, take care.
3849086	3849906	Alright, that was great.
3849926	3850266	I like him.
3850526	3851147	Yeah, he's fun.
3851327	3851707	He's fun.
3852067	3852407	Alright.
3852768	3854749	I'm trying to convince Dan to let me buy the $80 package.
3854769	3854869	Nice.
3857190	3858291	Dan, money.
3858311	3859032	Dan, package.
3860053	3860734	Well, no.
3860774	3861795	It's Hanukkah, for God's sake.
3861815	3864717	Well, it is, but he already bought me games.
3864898	3867300	So somebody give me 80 bucks.
3867560	3867780	All right.
3868161	3869022	It'll go to a good cause.
3869082	3869642	It'll go to me.
3870223	3871464	I know that went on a little long.
3871504	3873846	Sorry, I think I ate more show than we intended to, but Matt was a lot of fun.
3873886	3875228	I had to ask him about the worst driver thing.
3875268	3875588	I had to.
3876429	3878651	Live.VogNetwork.com if you want to keep commenting.
3878671	3880453	You forgot to ask him what he was playing.
3881193	3881713	I did.
3882353	3883014	Shame.
3883914	3884794	What's more important, though?
3885074	3887395	The where's the money going question or the what are you playing question?
3887415	3889895	I think the more important one was the worst driver.
3890136	3891836	That was the most important question.
3891876	3892136	All right.
3892516	3892796	I'm sorry.
3892816	3893456	That was awesome.
3893476	3897358	And now I know that I'm glad I didn't watch the American.
3897418	3899858	Because I thought about going back to find it.
3899898	3901159	Because you know me.
3901219	3902959	I've seen every... I know.
3903299	3904820	Except for the last two episodes.
3904860	3905620	You come in here all the time.
3905700	3906260	I hate TV.
3906280	3907000	I never watch TV.
3907020	3907880	But Canada's the worst driver.
3907900	3908081	Oh, my God.
3908101	3909021	It's because I watch it on YouTube.
3909041	3909501	All right.
3910482	3911323	We gotta get back to games.
3913306	3918635	To register for participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase adult.
3919596	3923322	Quickly, let's try to get through the rest of our gaming weeks and then some of the news as well.
3923362	3923563	Loki.
3924756	3926297	So this week I played a few things.
3926697	3932659	I've been meaning to play Fallout New Vegas since last Steam sale.
3934080	3937041	And so I finally got around to playing it and I did not like it.
3937621	3941683	And I was so disappointed because I really had high hopes for that game and
3942703	3944824	I don't know if I want to spend the effort to do that right now.
3960192	3984121	um but anyways I just I just didn't like the the setting I didn't like the story because I didn't understand what the hell was going on and I just didn't like the way it played there's no fucking sprint for one at least I couldn't find it um so it was just I don't know it bugged me it just rubbed me the wrong way I guess and so I don't know if I'm gonna continue on with it
3985580	3989142	That said, I also played Minecraft this week.
3990123	3998067	Just for a little bit, I went ahead and updated my version I had on PC to get the latest thing because they just put an update out not too long ago.
3998087	3999408	It's like 1.7.2 now.
4000168	4001009	I didn't realize that.
4001049	4003350	I need to check it out too.
4003430	4005071	Yeah, it's changed.
4005091	4009253	Holy shit, the biomes now are really intricate.
4009313	4013676	I reloaded our seed that we had and it's fucking terrible now.
4014777	4015397	Thanks for watching!
4035872	4052491	and then they also have the ones where you can spawn these like really um I don't know what they call it like uh basically exaggerated versions of the different biomes and stuff um almost like extreme or something and it looks really um unique very tall mountains and stuff um
4054424	4057587	I still haven't gotten around to setting up the multiplayer server, so I don't know about that yet.
4059169	4063393	Then also... I'm hoping for a VOG Minecraft server comeback in 2014.
4063453	4063873	I'm hoping.
4064114	4065535	I have all the information to do it.
4065555	4066256	I just haven't gotten around to it.
4066276	4069459	There's no more Team Fortress 2 server, so maybe I can redirect the money.
4069599	4070980	We have... Well, no.
4071160	4076586	No, we have... Gally has offered us his server, so... No hate against Team Fortress 2, by the way.
4076626	4077306	I still love Team Fortress 2.
4077366	4078968	It just wasn't really being used anymore.
4079068	4107423	yeah so um next game Gatling has a server up but see that's the thing is getting people like on it because it was a ghost town like most of the time um and that's kind of the problem with anything that we do like even like Team Fortress 2 and stuff it's a ghost town most of the time so um I don't know and even like creative mode gets boring after a while it's like survival at least there's something you like if you're playing on your own there's stuff that you can be doing whereas it's like if you go into you know creative mode it's like
4107623	4108424	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4129563	4140493	Um, and then Steam Sale, like, I've been looking at stuff, I almost bought a lot of things, but the only thing I bought, um, is just the Season Pass for Saints Row 4.
4140553	4149401	Now, I know I said I wasn't gonna do that, but it was on sale, you know, 66% off, and I feel that the price of that is, is definitely worth what they're giving me.
4150081	4154544	Although what it gave me instead of really shitty DLC was a thing that broke my game.
4154844	4158407	And so now I had to uninstall it and I have to reinstall it and see if that fixes it.
4158647	4162269	I thought at first, oh, it's because I have mods that I made and put in there and stuff like that.
4162610	4164611	Well, I took all those out and it still didn't fucking work.
4164711	4168414	So I'm a little disappointed that it broke the whole game.
4168554	4170135	So we'll see if I reload it.
4170315	4176119	Maybe it'll fix itself and I can start slowly loading the mods in and see if that works again.
4176219	4177059	But I'm just...
4178460	4179420	It just, it's annoying.
4179861	4180081	Sure.
4180301	4180881	To say the least.
4181041	4194385	And then, a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 5, did a, got in the back of a train and got five stars and was sniping people with, you know, my sniper rifle and stuff as Trevor, so that was kind of fun.
4194405	4195806	I'm sorry, I have to bring this up.
4195826	4199707	You mentioned Steam sale and DarkSakura, because it was like, oh, six o'clock, new Flash sales.
4200007	4201588	So she just loaded it up on her iPad.
4201908	4202868	Shut up, don't judge me.
4202928	4205409	Literally at the same time, we both pointed and went, Deadpool.
4205429	4205689	Yeah.
4206529	4208070	I don't care how shitty this game is.
4208310	4209651	I don't care how shitty it is.
4210452	4212973	I'm getting the fucking Deadpool game because fuck is Deadpool.
4213593	4215094	And I'm a consumer whore.
4215334	4216035	It's one of those nights.
4217215	4219016	I was trying to get Bobby to buy Saints Row.
4219036	4219597	They had it down at $19.
4219637	4222058	So I was like, okay.
4222538	4224940	But yeah, so I've been good.
4225040	4227221	I've been thinking like, okay, I'm going to buy these games.
4227241	4228982	Like I almost bought Fallout 3.
4229162	4232004	Almost bought... What was it?
4232404	4239106	Far Cry 3, Almost Bought, Rise of the Triad, because that was down to like $5.09.
4239926	4246328	Still might, I don't know, but I'm looking at my library of games I have and I'm like, I haven't played most of this stuff.
4246628	4248549	If I buy these, I'm not going to play them either.
4248589	4251390	You need to make a resolution of yourself like DarkSakura did.
4252130	4253091	I'm going to play one a week.
4253271	4255252	I'm not playing one a week.
4255312	4256433	Okay, that's not going to happen.
4256533	4256853	That's true.
4257433	4259475	The wife is expecting a new baby soon.
4259755	4260755	Oh, that doesn't mean it.
4260795	4261876	Well, yeah.
4261916	4263777	But that means more than you might think right now, Loki.
4265078	4265358	All right.
4265398	4271342	But like Bioshock, for example, Bioshock Infinite came down to about $7 on Gamefly.
4271622	4273563	I was like, you know, I should just buy it for that.
4273583	4276305	But I'm like, no, I fucking played through it on Xbox 360 online.
4277185	4278746	Am I really going to play through the game again?
4278946	4279166	No.
4279287	4283710	Why am I cluttering my fucking account with these games I'm never going to play?
4284510	4285731	So that's kind of where I'm at.
4288667	4316886	but there is a nice gap between now and when more games are coming out so I do have time to catch up I do want to play more Grand Theft Auto 5 but my wife has been wanting to watch Hulu and she doesn't like the Playstation 3 controller because if you set it on the couch the right way or not the right way it accidentally taps one of those analog sticks and fast forwards and she throws a fit and I'm like fine so I don't want to play my 360 character to get it up to where my PS3 character is but
4317849	4319362	I may just have to go PS3 I guess.
4320765	4321986	DLC Quest DLC Quest DLC Quest
4350222	4352903	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4375714	4402047	and I'm in the middle of that right now the game is not really particularly difficult and at its core you've really played a game like this a thousand times because since the coin is you know the coins that used to get the quote-unquote DLC are just you know things you pick up in game we've all played that game where it's like now you have to get this item to go unlock this door now you need to get this item to get past this but you know it's we've all played a game like that before it's a very very common formula in games
4402367	4405770	I'm not razzing this game for that because, again, it's a budget game.
4405810	4406191	It's an indie game.
4406211	4406991	It's also pretty old, too.
4407251	4408613	Yeah, it has been out a little while.
4408873	4413937	And you have to remember it's more a commentary, and it does have a funny little script to it.
4414258	4416019	And I did LOL a few times.
4416179	4425248	So, you know, for $1 or even $3 or whatever they're asking for it normally, it's a fine little evening jaunt through DLC Quest.
4425308	4426609	So check that one out.
4427450	4434577	I also checked out a game called Spelunky, which I'd been wanting to check out for a long time, and then finally when it hit, what, four bucks or whatever it was, I was like, done.
4435498	4436980	I like this game an awful lot.
4437120	4440664	I am fucking terrible at it, but I find that I'm learning more and more.
4440744	4442726	I'm gonna tell you what I love most about Spelunky.
4442986	4445188	I am a whore for roguelike games.
4445609	4448432	You know, the roguelike games, like back to the old school rogue and...
4449052	4451515	You know, Rogue Legacy even is like a roguelike game, obviously.
4452135	4456779	Spelunky's kind of like that too, and you find more layers of the game as you progress.
4456799	4458361	Like, oh, I've never seen this item before.
4458421	4459042	What does this do?
4459462	4462224	Oh, you know, all the levels are randomly generated.
4463686	4472254	It's fun, and one thing I love a lot about it is it really reminds me of a classic PC game, but kind of done in modern context.
4472834	4473835	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4489685	4516997	but there are like challenge boards where one you know you'll have a certain level set that you can only play once per day and you go as far as you can and once you're done you're done there's a whole community around this game like live streams of people doing that and so forth so I enjoyed Spelunky I think I got it at a steal I think the game is worth whatever they're asking for normally like $15 or what have you right so Spelunky I will probably be talking about this game more in future weeks we have a little more time the last game I picked up
4518254	4521436	Gone Home I bought for $5 and it was on sale.
4522097	4523718	And I will tell you this.
4524018	4529541	I started Gone Home at about probably 9 o'clock on Friday night.
4529661	4531743	I just kind of said, all right, I need to check out this game finally.
4531783	4532503	I started playing it.
4533123	4540028	I did not get up out of my chair except maybe to use the restroom and get water until I beat the game at about 1 a.m.
4540488	4542790	So I played this thing from start to finish.
4543030	4544611	I was really into it.
4545171	4549553	I will say this, and this is probably a common thing you're going to hear about Gone Home.
4550293	4557657	It's not really a game, but it's definitely an interactive story.
4558317	4563140	I feel like it's best described, this is how I felt about it, it's like a first person movie.
4563920	4566181	Imagine you control the movie.
4566901	4569022	That's kind of what this game felt like to me.
4569763	4569843	Um...
4570683	4594907	at its core it's not i could probably i'm not going to but i could probably spoil the whole damn thing for you in three sentences like the whole game i'm not going to do that because that would be a dick thing to do and i think watching the layers of it unfold it's not so much the punchline quote unquote like i could tell you those those three sentences that would ruin the game for you but at the same time i think it's about how we get to that
4595567	4604790	and all those really kind of unsettling things and the way things are presented in the game that really made this game a very special experience.
4605391	4613814	I'm just going to say it's not for everybody because some people are going to play this and be like, wait a minute, this is not the game I was expecting at all.
4614634	4636776	so you got to be prepared that it's going to be a little bit more of a story that slowly unravels and there's really not like challenge to it per se uh there's no like there's no monster that's going to jump out from behind the curtain and eat you to death although you might get that impression from you know what you see about the game and so forth it's actually very much not like that at all my one
4638234	4650877	issue with the game is that because I think it was trying to present itself one way and then kind of end up being another sort of story, I feel like there were things in a context that weren't fully explored.
4650937	4656619	I'm being vague on purpose because I don't want to ruin this for you, but I felt there were certain things that didn't really get explored enough.
4657059	4659620	When the game ended, I did feel resolution.
4659660	4660820	I felt satisfaction.
4660880	4663541	I felt like, wow, that was a good movie I just watched.
4663861	4667282	I felt that when I finished the game, except I was like,
4667722	4668222	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4692074	4694295	I think the game normally is like what, 10 or 15?
4695376	4706841	I just want to caution you, although I felt it was good and you would pay 10 or 15 for a movie, some people may not feel the value when it's only going to take you three to four hours to beat, if that.
4706881	4708742	Some of you will probably fly through it faster than me.
4709182	4737360	I'm very OCD with the games and looking at every little corner which actually pays off in this game immensely I just want to kind of warn you that now there are some things they do to try to enhance the value like there's a director's commentary mode you can play through and so forth to try and encourage a second play and so on but I just want to warn you if you're expecting like oh I'm going to buy this game and it's going to give me hundreds of hours of satisfaction think of it more like a movie because that's kind of what it is it's more like an interactive movie but
4738783	4744646	I sort of really love... How do I put my finger on this?
4746727	4752310	I just kind of love what I think this game may have started.
4752790	4754811	That was incredibly distinct and clear.
4755623	4756144	I know, right?
4756844	4768493	I feel like this is going to be the first, or maybe not even the first, because I can think of other games I've played like this, but I think this is going to be a definitely notable, and you're seeing it getting Game of the Year nods and so forth and so on.
4768913	4777340	I think this is going to be one of those games where we look back and we go, you know, this is the point that this art form really started to take off.
4778814	4779074	DarkSakura.com
4798647	4801189	I'll encourage you, don't go out there and spoil it for yourself.
4801350	4806495	Because again, it could be spoiled for you in three sentences, and there's some real dickheads that spoil it in comments and so forth.
4806856	4810039	I really think it's best experienced getting in there and doing it.
4811181	4812642	Jason, quickly, your gaming week.
4813423	4813543	Um...
4814344	4822732	Pretty light week because Monday through Wednesday we're spent wrapping up everything at work and then I've been around doing a lot of different things.
4823733	4830479	My sale haul was that I picked up a two-pack of Divekick and I needed to figure out what to do with the second copy.
4831320	4836725	I picked up Splunky as well, Final Fantasy VII, the Bioshock triple pack, and Counter-Strike Go...
4838251	4843313	Still not entirely sure why, because I've never been good at that game or anything of the sort, but I have it.
4844074	4850177	And Ragenator has thanked me numerous times, both in chat, and then he mentioned it when he called into Bobby's show.
4851137	4852638	Bobby Blackwolf, 6 p.m.
4852718	4854399	Pacific on the VOG Network.
4854419	4854539	5 p.m.
4854559	4854899	Pacific.
4855719	4857800	6pm the times when you're used to.
4858200	4858640	So close.
4860101	4862842	As he sat on his call, I picked up the Saints Row pack for him.
4862922	4863722	He was talking about it.
4863802	4864842	He wanted some stuff to play.
4865463	4867783	It was dirt cheap and it is a lot of content.
4867884	4868904	I really enjoyed Saints Row 3.
4869704	4871445	So I threw the pack his way.
4872325	4878209	Um, I've, because I've been moving around so much this week, I've actually gotten kind of back into the mobile swing of things again.
4878749	4882992	I picked up Sonic Dash, which is just an endless runner, time-killing kind of game.
4883412	4887835	Um, I've been very addicted to QuizUp in the last week or two, and me and Rob played around with that the other night.
4887855	4888595	That's a fun little iPhone game.
4888635	4889896	That is a fun little iPhone game.
4889916	4890297	Very fun.
4890337	4891898	It's very, very well curated.
4891998	4893999	Which means in 60 days we'll no longer be playing it.
4894079	4895160	That's what happens to iPhone games.
4895740	4896861	And then there was the other...
4897741	4898481	Was it just those two?
4898561	4907125	I feel like there was a third game that I've been playing phone or iPad rather often, but probably just QuizUp and Sonic Dash.
4907525	4910526	The Usual Suspects, a little bit of Rogue Legacy, a little bit of FTL.
4911487	4919030	FTL randoms were abysmally terrible and I just got destroyed before I even hit the third sector.
4919270	4926973	A couple more power-ups in Rogue Legacy, still plowing through that, trying to get further, pick up more equipment, pieces of equipment and upgrades and all that.
4927133	4929334	Thanks for watching!
4949842	4970166	and so um and i've kind of been able to watch like oh how was it received this week and so forth so i kind of made a decision on how we're going to kind of treat the youtube thing going forward um so this is how it's going to work is that um we will post the episodes to youtube obviously they will not be videos they're just going to be audio for archive purposes uh we will post the shows to youtube but we're going to post them on a one week delay
4970746	4972087	and you might be thinking like, what?
4972127	4972787	Why would you do that?
4973248	4981833	Well, because I love the idea of like YouTube for like the archive purposes and so forth and kind of being able to go find your favorite parts of the show and so forth and all that.
4982313	4984374	But I'm going to just keep it real with you guys.
4986095	4988537	We want the hits at orangeentrader.com and vognetwork.com.
4990178	4993139	YouTube is great for discovery and so forth and branching out to that audience.
4993599	5007006	But it really helps us in being able to sell the show as media and help with events and so forth if we can get the hits with OrangeLoungeRadio.com and so forth.
5007066	5013509	So the podcast and Stitcher and TuneIn and those sorts of apps that tap into the official podcast feed...
5013909	5017452	Those are the ways we sort of prefer that people listen to the show.
5017512	5020754	So those are the ones that we're going to support with the immediate Sunday night uploads.
5021474	5024837	But we will continue to support YouTube on the delay.
5025597	5037145	I will say this, though, just so that if you're like a YouTube dedicated person, I don't want you to get upset because definitely we're exploring what are other ways we can actually get involved with actual video on YouTube.
5037185	5039106	I know I've been doing that a lot through my own channel.
5039167	5040387	Plug, plug, Rob Roberts Plays.
5040708	5041088	Plug, plug.
5041849	5051799	and I'm sure there will be more stuff to come in the future so stay tuned for things that aren't just audio archives of the show and hopefully some more interactive content over on the YouTube
5052765	5055547	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
5055567	5058748	We're going to try to move through it quickly because we're already an hour and 20 minutes into the show.
5059048	5060109	But we'll try to get through this quickly.
5060569	5062330	Loki, why don't you start us off with some news tonight?
5062771	5073416	Alright, so as we mentioned last week, there have been some people using Playroom on the PlayStation 4 as a means to kind of broadcast themselves.
5073917	5076438	Almost like a talk show format or whatever.
5076998	5078819	And some people have been abusing that to...
5080040	5087206	Broadcast themselves doing pornographic things, which I'm personally fine with, but apparently Twitch isn't.
5087706	5098054	So because of that, Twitch has momentarily removed the Playroom content from the directory, because they say the majority of it was non-gaming related content.
5098925	5100165	Thank you for watching!
5115090	5119373	Um, this is, I mean, there was a part of me that was like, oh, that's so frustrating.
5119413	5122015	I mean, it's not that I'm like sitting here going, oh, Twitch shouldn't have done that.
5122075	5125778	I mean, they kind of had to because people were, you know, abusing it or whatever.
5126238	5131962	But I was just like, damn, it really sucks that there wasn't a way to really kind of manage that.
5132222	5134004	And I don't know what you could do.
5134244	5137466	I mean, it's the whole infamous TTP joke we make everywhere.
5137586	5141968	Here on Orange Lounge Radio where you put a new peripheral out there and what's the time to penis?
5142308	5145869	How long before somebody puts their dick in it or shows their dick on it or so forth?
5146329	5147150	Or draws a dick.
5147290	5147690	Exactly.
5148210	5153672	As we found with this, it wasn't very long at all and that's why it's gotten pulled and so forth.
5153692	5156313	There were some really disgusting things that were going on on Playroom.
5156734	5158254	I'm not just talking about showing body parts.
5158274	5159735	There were some really disgusting things happening.
5159855	5160315	Yeah, I saw them.
5160795	5173403	So, yeah, well, so I understand completely why they pulled it, but damn it, because there was some great potential there for people to start their own homegrown broadcasts and get voices out there and so forth.
5173803	5183749	I guess you could still do that on Ustream, so I would encourage you, if you were one of those people that was like, shit, I could have used Playroom to start my podcast or to start my video show.
5184389	5186571	Don't let that discourage you completely.
5186651	5188793	You could feasibly still do Ustream.
5188833	5190994	It's going to be a little harder to build an audience, but you know what?
5191975	5192996	You got to start somewhere.
5193536	5196479	Or you could probably get drivers for the camera eventually.
5197380	5199281	Yeah, that'll happen too.
5199301	5204625	I think that has a special adapter for it, though, or a special proprietary plug or something.
5204645	5206367	But you know they'll come out with something.
5206407	5210110	I mean, they did it with the Kinect and stuff so that...
5210610	5216435	And honestly, it doesn't probably cost too much to get, you know, some sort of webcam.
5216495	5220698	And a lot of computers have webcams built into them or even laptops and stuff.
5220718	5228063	So, you know, I wouldn't say... If you can afford a, you know, PlayStation 4, you probably could afford a, you know, a webcam if you really wanted to do that.
5228344	5228484	Yeah.
5229024	5233087	So, yeah, and I'm all for more voices, more broadcasting getting out there.
5233147	5234768	So just, you know, kind of on a side note, but...
5235754	5236935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5252592	5255293	So there's been some changes with Miiverse that happened this past week.
5255953	5258574	And obviously this is to support this whole consolidation.
5259234	5261354	Some new display options in the community list.
5261675	5263575	You can display more communities at once.
5263635	5270337	There's also going to be communities based on categories like Wii U software, Virtual Console, and assumably 3DS and so on.
5270877	5278219	Your profile will no longer display the total number of yas you've given, which was basically how many inches your Nintendo e-peen was.
5278599	5279619	It was right there on your profile.
5279639	5281560	Like how many people have clicked like on my posts?
5282000	5284861	That's not there anymore, so there's no more competition, I suppose.
5285201	5287462	You can still see your yas on individual posts.
5289143	5292104	Also, the default display setting in the community.
5292164	5296086	When you entered the community before, you would see everybody's posts.
5296526	5301408	Now it defaults to only showing you posts from people who've actually played the game.
5302108	5316308	you can take that out and look at every post if you want to but I kind of understand that change I do, you want the discussion to be people who have actually played the game it's unfortunate for the people who might be popping in there to ask would I like this game
5317409	5318189	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5335575	5338838	Nobody's really doing that, and it is kind of neat, like when it works.
5339518	5348805	Anyway, one other thing that is neat to be a part of, if you're lucky enough to be there, you might actually get a free Wii U console if you end up on the right Southwest Airlines flight.
5349005	5350887	Yeah, a Southwest Airlines flight.
5351367	5353749	Apparently Nintendo and Southwest Airlines partnered up.
5354109	5357792	Nintendo is like the official video game company of Southwest Airlines.
5357832	5364197	There's gaming lounges in some of the heavy traffic Southwest airports, which would be what, like Las Vegas, I imagine has got to have something.
5365097	5391854	and they're giving away games and so forth and Flight 1883 which went from New Orleans to Dallas Love Field last week they gave over 100 passengers a brand new Wii U console so it's just kind of different ways to I mean we might be sitting here looking at that going that's kind of weird but it's just different it's just different ways to market you know Sony's doing something about PS4 on Facebook so one of those reblog campaigns they gave away two of them at the Sharks game last night
5392503	5392603	Oh.
5393184	5395707	So, you know, and I'm sure an Xbox.
5395807	5399551	They went to some YouTubers' houses and were giving them Xbox.
5399571	5402014	Some of their vocal critics were giving them Xbox Ones.
5402034	5402614	That was interesting.
5402634	5403636	Francis was the one that saw them.
5403656	5405518	Apparently, they're not listening to our show.
5406979	5407560	I know, right?
5407820	5409702	That was the only reason you were so mad, Loki.
5409722	5410603	You were just trying to get a free one.
5410623	5411464	I'm not mad at all.
5412265	5415127	Like I said, I'm not going to turn down free, but you know.
5416008	5424473	Anyway, so yeah, fly more Southwest, I suppose, if you want to possibly win a free Wii U. That's a good excuse to go Southwest as your airline.
5425073	5428496	The most entertaining flights I've ever had were Southwest flights.
5429156	5429537	That's true.
5429557	5430838	Let's just go to Disneyland a bunch.
5430998	5442390	Well, see, again, we're not commercially endorsed, but I do have to give JetBlue a shout out because I do love those TVs because I flew cross-country and watched five hours of SpongeBob SquarePants.
5442970	5444452	Best flight I ever took to New York City.
5444472	5445413	Oh, that sounds awful.
5446594	5447174	For the record.
5447214	5447994	Haters gonna hate.
5448195	5448695	For the record.
5448755	5448975	What?
5450235	5450915	Crap, what was it?
5450955	5451736	It wasn't Delta.
5451876	5454616	It was something when I flew to Alabama.
5455477	5456917	Seriously, the worst thing ever.
5457017	5457957	It was American.
5457977	5458578	US Air, I'm sure.
5458998	5459398	American.
5459418	5460298	American Airlines.
5461078	5461318	Awful.
5462119	5463219	All right, what do you have for us, DarkSakura?
5464534	5465315	Have some crap.
5466295	5467556	Because this is a bunch of crap.
5468116	5471759	So, once again, Shenmue 3 ain't happening.
5472639	5476161	That whole trademark application?
5476602	5477122	Fake!
5477983	5479884	Sega's like, uh, no?
5480444	5482185	Didn't we tell you this for the last ten years?
5482746	5483046	No!
5484387	5489490	Now, I think there's a silver lining to this we'll get into later in the show, but... There's another fake, too.
5489550	5490070	Oh, go ahead.
5490310	5490931	For Fallout 4.
5492734	5494916	Well, it's going to happen eventually.
5494936	5496577	We all know what's going to happen.
5496597	5500240	But the one that's up right now has a fake trailer and everything.
5500300	5502842	No.
5502862	5508326	There's been a ton of this with Blizzard-related products, too, of fake trademarks.
5508386	5515911	I think the lesson we all need to learn from these various fake trademark stories, stop running with articles on TradeFia.
5515931	5516432	Just stop.
5517272	5519975	But trademarks don't mean anything anymore.
5520715	5523698	Trademarks, patents, probably something else too.
5523778	5524718	IMDB pages.
5525039	5525339	Stop.
5525379	5525859	Yeah, stop.
5526039	5526360	All of it.
5526680	5527521	Not news sources.
5527961	5529702	These are no longer credible news sources.
5529822	5530043	Done.
5530103	5532204	You're saying 4chan's not a reliable news source?
5533505	5540611	I hate to offend, but in places I think to go for gaming news, that's not really at the top of the list.
5540951	5545015	Biting gaming commentary, perhaps, but not for gaming news.
5546363	5566187	For the record, Spongebob is the devil Whatever, hater He's not the devil, he's too dumb to be the devil Alright I seriously tried to watch an episode of that and I thought I could feel my brain melting It was awful It's just fucking Ren and Stimpy under the sea, that's all it is Ren and Stimpy was cool Do you hate Adventure Time too?
5566347	5570348	No, I love Adventure Time I don't get you, because I love Adventure Time too
5570908	5597337	but I heard the game is not so great a friend told me that the game is like it's only fun if you have like multiplayer but like a single player it's the the why are we in the dungeon I don't know or whatever that game is called I've heard it's great for multiplayer but for single players I almost picked it up yeah yeah if we find it on sale we should do a multiplayer I found a used copy well tell me just tell me which system you guys get it on and I'll bug my d3 rep to give me a copy because he loves me so
5597617	5599318	How about you get three copies?
5599518	5600838	Yeah, I don't think that's going to work.
5601499	5601839	Or four.
5601899	5602539	Jason wants one too.
5602919	5603219	All right.
5603579	5605620	Let's travel around the world and check out release dates.
5606280	5608001	There might not be a lot, but we'll try anyway.
5608041	5608621	Release dates.
5609002	5610902	This is easy because I already memorized this one.
5611002	5613003	There's only one game coming out this week, and that's Gran Turismo 6.
5613403	5614064	And it's on Friday.
5614484	5614704	Nice.
5615484	5616004	On PlayStation 3.
5616645	5617165	Lots of cars.
5618405	5620766	Pretty big game.
5621186	5622587	We don't have to wait three years.
5624239	5626402	Alright, and so it will actually be happening.
5626442	5630168	Now, how can we prove to Bobby Blackwolf that the game will actually be coming out?
5630448	5632571	Because he doesn't think Gran Turismo 5 ever happened.
5633506	5634567	This is actually happening.
5634707	5635627	It hasn't been delayed.
5635767	5642650	They announced it was coming out, you know, quarter four 2013 and we're in quarter four 2013.
5642710	5643251	No delays.
5643351	5644951	So we're all good.
5645412	5650614	So what we need to do is we need everybody to go to like, you know, your local game store, wherever it is.
5650634	5655336	And when you see Gran Turismo 6 sitting on the shelf, you need to take a picture of it and put it on Twitter.
5655656	5657857	Hashtag believe me, Bobby.
5659798	5661339	And you can drive in the moon.
5663030	5663671	Get the fuck out.
5663711	5664492	You can drive on the moon?
5664512	5665213	You can drive on the moon.
5667435	5668316	Is it Moon Patrol?
5668736	5673021	No, they have a moon... You have a moon lander that you can drive, and there's actual achievements for driving on the moon.
5673361	5677465	If you could have aliens and Bill Clinton in a hot tub at the end of Cruisin' World, then, you know...
5680368	5682289	All right, going to Japan.
5682909	5685150	You have a little more to look forward to this week.
5685410	5688351	Gran Turismo 6 is there as well, but there's some other games as well.
5688691	5691652	Metal Gear Rising Revengeance gets a special edition on the PlayStation 3.
5692812	5696133	Daikokai Jidai Online Gran Atlus is released this week.
5696673	5700094	Kaihou Shoujuu Sin in regular and limited edition also this week.
5700534	5703695	And there are Gran Turismo 6 PlayStation 3 bundles this week.
5703795	5706736	So if you're in Japan, you've been holding out on a PlayStation 3 bundle.
5707356	5709258	and maybe this is the game that's going to do it for you.
5709839	5712502	Believe me, Bobby, it's out in Japan this week.
5712582	5713103	So there you go.
5713463	5716487	Also, The Walking Dead comes out in Japan.
5716667	5718929	Is this the... I'm trying to look real quick.
5718969	5721753	Oh, this is the Telltale version, the good one.
5722213	5723074	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5743217	5748780	Also, there's an Xbox 360 Slim with a 320 gig hard drive being released this week.
5749180	5750921	I'm not sure what that's in celebration of.
5751081	5753923	Just an excuse to get another 360 on the shelf, I suppose.
5755084	5757665	On the Vita this week, Batman Arkham Origins is there as well.
5757865	5762287	And there's a new lime green, white, pink, black, and light blue, white Vitas.
5762788	5764369	Those models are making their way out this week.
5764809	5767710	Also, Tearaway, which has been getting really good reviews over here.
5767750	5768731	I haven't played it myself yet.
5769031	5770152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5794651	5796292	and the answer may be never unfortunately.
5796652	5817558	But on the Nintendo 3DS, Bravely Default for the sequel, Geist Crusher, Inazuma 11 Go, Galaxy Big Bang and Galaxy Supernova and some Hello Kitty purses and pouches for your 3DS LL or XL but LL in Japan are released this week because you know you want a My Melody pouch in pink or red.
5817578	5819118	No, I want a Duffy case.
5820058	5821439	Give me a Duffy case for my DS.
5822320	5822762	Stay tuned.
5823023	5824368	Alright, those are the releases in Japan.
5824408	5826214	So a much busier week in Japan than here in the States.
5826254	5826676	How about the UK?
5827068	5827749	A little busier.
5828489	5840881	On the 4th we have Dark Out for PC, on the 5th Space Hulk on iPad, Speedball 2 HD, SteamWorld Dig for Mac and PC, and Bravely Default for the sequel on 3DS.
5841041	5851491	And then on the 6th is Scribblenauts Unlimited for 3DS and Wii U. Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.
5851551	5852272	But first, Loki.
5853635	5858797	I just realized that Just Cause 2 multiplayer is coming back or is coming to Steam.
5858917	5860218	That's fucking awesome.
5860478	5864800	So seriously, buy Just Cause 2 if you haven't already because it's like two bucks.
5866241	5868902	Multiplayer with like a thousand people at a time.
5869362	5871443	You're giving an awful lot of endorsements tonight.
5872944	5881868	Dude, it's a sandbox game with guns and vehicles and stuff and grappling hooks with a thousand people at one time.
5883441	5885288	Come on, that sounds fucking awesome.
5885308	5886492	That's what Grand Theft Auto should have been.
5887074	5888018	Especially with grappling hooks.
5888439	5888680	Anyways.
5891102	5899967	So Microsoft, of course, they're going to be launching the Xbox One in Japan later on in 2014.
5900987	5914415	And to go along with that, they are teaming up with some developers, or Japanese developers to be exact, to offer some games that may be exclusive to the Xbox One platform.
5914775	5916416	And of course, those haven't been revealed yet.
5917156	5944371	but um they will be full Japanese games and not like you know digital games like Panzer Dragoon or something like that and of course uh announcements coming later on about that I'm not sure where they're supposed to announcement or you know announce all that stuff but um soon hopefully since I want to say they're launching in the spring I may be thinking PlayStation 3 but
5946912	5947212	I don't know.
5947292	5947953	That's kind of neat.
5949655	5952397	At least it seems like they're taking it kind of seriously.
5953358	5961165	So maybe kind of a turnaround from what we saw in the 360 where Microsoft really wants to get their foot in Japan, Japanese households.
5961245	5965289	Maybe we'll see something like we saw with Blue Dragon and stuff like that.
5965889	5967671	Maybe something along those lines.
5967771	5976197	I imagine, too, this is timed because the Xbox One is not out in Japan, but perhaps they're going to start, you know, before it's released there in 2014, they're going to really start to get some of this news out here.
5976477	5981881	They're going to leverage Square Enix to give them another Dragon Quest game, maybe Dragon Quest, you know, was it... 11?
5981921	5982441	11 or something.
5982762	5985183	They're going to be on 11 now, because they're probably not going to get 10.
5985464	5986965	Well, never say never.
5987385	5993689	And if Microsoft reverses its policies, Microsoft could get Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, too.
5994390	5996191	It's known that Square Enix wanted to do it for 360.
5996231	5996331	Yeah.
5997932	6012837	and it's just Microsoft's the one that did not but they will not budge on the cross servers thing and I props to Square Enix for not budging on that so it'll be interesting if they can kind of sit together at the table they did it for 11 they can do it for 14 that would be interesting very interesting all right um
6013957	6023499	Also interesting of note news coming out of Japan, Super Mario 3D World, the sales figures are in, and well, unfortunately it doesn't look great.
6024359	6026780	There's some conflicting reports about how much it sold.
6027540	6038883	Media Create says they sold just under 100,000 units of Super Mario 3D World, and Famitsu says it was about 107K, so either way you're looking at about 100,000 sold.
6039263	6041043	Here's the thing to put that into perspective.
6041884	6043244	Mario 3D Land
6044404	6046906	344,000.
6044685	6046906	That's the 3DS one.
6047526	6054750	Super Mario Sunshine, 280,000, which of the modern games, it seems like Sunshine gets dumped on the most.
6054790	6055631	I'm just throwing it out there.
6056591	6059853	Super Mario 64 on the 3DS, the remake, 120,000.
6061414	6063616	still sold more than Super Mario 3D World.
6063696	6068379	Now, I'm not saying this... Are those, like, lifetime sales, or is that just... No, no, first week sales.
6068439	6069399	Those are all first week sales.
6069439	6069960	Oh, no, God.
6070400	6073942	Oh, all those games sold over a million, except for Sunshine, actually didn't, in Japan.
6075223	6078185	Sunshine ended with $789,000 and change.
6078265	6079026	But here's the thing.
6079426	6084549	I don't want this to be like, oh, we're kicking Nintendo while they're down, or the sky is falling, or whatever.
6084649	6087411	But I bring this up because, you know, I...
6088812	6092035	Nintendo ain't going bankrupt, so stop those rumors and that shit.
6092055	6094157	They survived the Virtual Boy, they'll survive this.
6094437	6098441	I was going to mention, the numbers are on VG Charts for North America.
6098481	6098902	Oh, are they?
6098922	6099783	I didn't know they were out yet.
6099983	6101344	Yes, they're always a week behind, but 243,000.
6102225	6102625	Wow, okay.
6102725	6105228	Interesting.
6105588	6108511	So it's not exactly a bust.
6108711	6110773	Europe, did it come out over there in Europe?
6110833	6111954	Let's see here.
6112114	6112635	Europe...
6115241	6116662	I guess it did not come out over there.
6117362	6117583	Yet.
6118123	6118283	Yet.
6118303	6122206	But that's a very interesting silver lining is that it sold twice as many in the U.S.
6122266	6122927	as it did in Japan.
6122967	6123848	That's very interesting.
6124048	6124928	More than twice as many.
6124968	6125349	Hold on.
6125569	6127030	It's giving me weird dates here.
6127110	6127571	Okay.
6127651	6132895	And then, yeah, they're saying 101, 798 is in Japan.
6132915	6136478	I'm going to check Europe again because it's giving me a weird date.
6136578	6136938	Oh, they don't.
6137058	6137719	See, that's it.
6137739	6138839	They don't have last week.
6139900	6141541	They only have up to the 16th.
6142382	6152849	The problem that people are really identifying with this is that for the install base of the Wii, and this is important to say, for the install base that the Wii U has currently, we all know the Wii U is struggling a little bit, it's no secret.
6153209	6155911	So for the install base that the Wii U has, those numbers aren't bad.
6156672	6162476	But the problem is the game was expected to push more Wii U sales, and we're not seeing that really happen in Japan yet.
6163536	6185582	Again, I think it's a little too early to say the sky is falling completely, but I think there are a lot of us that are rooting for Nintendo and really hope they can turn it around, but it's gonna... I really wish they had had a second game like this to really kick... I mean, they certainly have it on the 3DS, but I wish they had another game to kind of kick out the gate this winter with this to really get people talking.
6185602	6190463	I guess you could say Zelda Wind Waker, but again, just something kind of new.
6190603	6190963	I don't know.
6191223	6191483	I just...
6193005	6196252	to really push those Wii U units because I definitely don't want to see Nintendo fail.
6196372	6196893	None of us do.
6197674	6198316	Well, that's the thing.
6198336	6203325	I'm curious to see what they're selling as far as Wii U systems because...
6205770	6211674	It's good that they sold those games, but I'm sure that they have more than 200,000 Wii U systems out there.
6212495	6216418	And I'd just be curious to see how that's actually translating to new sales.
6217279	6217719	You know what?
6217759	6231931	A very interesting point in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com made by Dungeon Buster, who says Lightning Returns also sold considerably less in its release window in Japan when compared to Final Fantasy XIII too, which was lower in opening sales than Final Fantasy XIII.
6232691	6236814	It just sounds like the sales were soft for titles in general in Japan.
6237154	6239596	And Legends, I'll link between worlds, 294,000.
6239816	6244599	And that's like, you know, that's through the 23rd.
6244639	6245940	That's day one sales.
6247061	6248602	I'm not surprised that that game's amazing.
6250684	6255187	And SJ100Matt says the game came out at a bad time with all the new consoles coming out now.
6256067	6256688	Not Japan, though.
6257508	6260250	Remember, Japan didn't have a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One until next year.
6260310	6260490	But...
6261691	6263933	Xbox One, no, but it was still imminent for the PlayStation 4.
6264013	6267717	Well, Nintendo's kind of competing against themselves in a way in Japan right now with 3DS.
6267757	6275844	I mean, sure, Sony's trying to up the presence with the Vita, and it's somewhat working, but Nintendo's biggest enemy in a way is the 3DS.
6276865	6277565	Gaming on the go.
6277625	6280448	Don't underestimate how huge gaming on the go is over there.
6280528	6285132	I mean, obviously, considering all the devices that you kids are all distracting yourselves with right now.
6286086	6287207	I have no idea what you're talking about.
6288127	6288427	Clearly.
6290008	6293590	Well, not this week, but to your credit, you don't have Animal Crossing right now.
6294010	6295010	It's in my purse.
6295991	6297772	And I have Zelda plugged in right now, actually.
6297792	6300733	I... No.
6301093	6301273	Yeah.
6301594	6301854	Go ahead.
6301954	6302574	I should log in.
6303334	6303715	You should.
6303955	6304515	Should open the gate.
6305455	6329466	I definitely agree with that point that it's trending mobile and when you're trying to hold on to the same issue with PC desktops and everything else these older inflexible, yeah they may have more features but you cannot play them anywhere else without difficulty you're right, mobile is the up and comer and it will be biting sales out from a lot of other things
6330766	6356819	Alright, well we'll see, I mean again, week one, let's see how this game does through the holiday season, we'll see But it could be very interesting to see what this is gonna have Nintendo doing in 2014 But you know what, it's not over, it ain't over Alright, let's move on, you know what, let's move back to a classic time when we didn't fucking stress on how well a game sold Because we didn't find out for like three months, because we got all our news from magazines
6357133	6358842	I wonder what's up with Jason's monkey hat
6361377	6362097	DarkSakura, which pick tonight?
6362137	6365278	I picked Marble Madness just because I had that stupid level 2 music stuck in my head.
6390245	6395050	How have you never picked this game before?
6395090	6395370	It's so good.
6395410	6400214	Because I was never a super fan of Marble Madness because it pisses me off!
6401175	6404779	Sorry, very loud dongs from Marble Madness.
6404799	6405079	Sorry guys.
6406059	6408622	The best music was the level 2 music for the record.
6409743	6415348	At any rate, it was designed by Mark Kearney and it came out in 1984.
6415389	6416189	It was an arcade game.
6417270	6420794	It was one of the most innovative games when it came out.
6420894	6428161	It used the Atari System 1 hardware and programmed in C. One of the first games to be programmed in C on that hardware.
6429383	6432185	It was also the first to use true stereo sound.
6432706	6435569	Previous ones used simulated stereo or mono.
6436490	6441695	So this one basically, in fact, I'm actually just going to pull this quote right here.
6442316	6450385	It was, the designer drew inspiration from many golf racing games and MC Escher, which we can totally see where that came from.
6451125	6459848	So basically the way you play Marble Madness is you are a little marble and you work your marble through mazes of different kind.
6461368	6469351	But you use a trackball, although home versions used different controllers with directional pads, which is probably why I hated playing it on the NES.
6470701	6474106	Um, so yeah, you have a different, you know, you can do practice.
6474166	6474887	Each one has a theme.
6474907	6484118	There's even like a backwards level where, uh, you go up instead of, uh, uh, you know, the usual down the course, uh, type of method.
6485200	6488304	Uh, the other thing with this one too is that, um,
6490518	6495361	It was just a really freaking bizarre and neat game for its time.
6495481	6501005	I mean, what was, I'm trying to think of what the word I'm trying to think of for the perspective.
6502166	6502706	Isometric.
6502746	6503547	Thank you, isometric.
6504908	6506308	It uses an isometric perspective.
6506909	6508110	You're looking at it on a diagonal.
6508150	6511552	It simulates a feeling of three dimensions very nicely.
6511792	6519817	Sorry, I'm just watching this awesome badass playing it here on YouTube, and he's in that upside-down level right now, and I'm just remembering what a mindfuck that level was.
6520057	6524820	Because, like, gravity goes the other way, and you don't know how bad that messes with you until you play it.
6526498	6530482	I mean, the whole game was just such a neat game.
6531202	6533925	And on top of that, this is an arcade when he's doing it with a trackball.
6533945	6537268	You have to play this game with a trackball if you want to play it with any kind of accuracy.
6538008	6543413	I do believe I actually have this on Atari 5200, I want to say, because we've got a trackball.
6545334	6550499	Anyway, moving back into some of the background on the game.
6550859	6560268	Actually, the guy who was working on this was supposed to be doing a video game version of Thriller, Michael Jackson's Thriller, and it was cancelled, so they moved into Marble Madness.
6560869	6567515	This particular one, at its time, was using a 19-inch CRT monitor and a Motorola 68010 central processing unit.
6570597	6575341	And it just basically was pretty tech-heavy for its time.
6575381	6576742	I mean, it was at the edge.
6577702	6582466	So as far as other... And there's actually... There are whole...
6584884	6587085	Just different kinds of programming tricks that went into this game.
6588126	6592629	It did shadows to control anti-aliasing.
6592869	6595350	It did light ray tracing.
6595410	6600073	I mean, the technology behind this game, it's a programming marvel for its time, I mean, to be honest.
6600794	6607758	There's actually, I believe, a whole site full of nothing but concept sketches that went behind this and the programming direction.
6608198	6608779	Really neat stuff.
6609899	6612282	So it was a big commercial success.
6612682	6617928	There were 4,000 cabinets sold and it was its highest earning game in arcades at the time.
6618128	6620530	But then it fell after seven weeks.
6622873	6624955	And really it was because it's such a short game.
6625335	6627538	And people just got frustrated to hell.
6630197	6657322	um really the lot of thing is that because it took such a high level of skill to play that's what made it really just an attractive game to have an attractive game to play so with that too there were other versions and a potential sequel and I will go ahead and put this out there I think that Super Monkey Ball was definitely influenced by this game
6658722	6664806	So as far as other versions, there was a Tiger Electronics handheld LCD game, which I had.
6665567	6668269	And Rare released the Nintendo version.
6670991	6672091	They were all very simple.
6672171	6675474	They weren't as great, clearly, as the arcade one.
6676815	6683960	Other versions that came out were the Amiga, Game Boy, Sega Mega Drive, the Spectrum, PC, and GBA versions.
6684841	6686202	Marvel Madness 2
6701484	6705326	It was in development by Kearney's partner for the first one, Bob Flanagan.
6707488	6718436	But it was supposed to expand, have invisibility, flight modes, pinball games set in between the levels, and three-player isometric racing.
6719436	6721698	But it just didn't happen.
6722098	6728042	There were prototypes that were out for location testing, but you know what it was going against at the time?
6729404	6744659	Street Fighter 2 and that was also in testing at the time so yeah so they went off of that and went to Guardians of the Hood instead which is a beat-em-up game but there are the prototypes exist and you can find I'm sure you can find ROMs of them so
6746020	6748642	I would love to see what people think about it.
6748763	6754567	But as far as, I mean, there were some spiritual successors too.
6754647	6758110	I said Super Monkey Ball kind of doing the successor thing.
6758691	6765016	There was Archer McLean's Mercury, Switch Ball, Never Ball, Marble Blast Gold.
6765537	6767358	That's on Linux and Mac OS and Windows.
6767378	6768039	It came out in 2003.
6769400	6771742	Ballance, and I'm saying that because there's two L's in it.
6773582	6775103	Just all kinds of different ones.
6776343	6777304	But nothing is the original.
6777784	6780265	Nothing will piss you off and make you hit the machine.
6781565	6784986	Nothing will make you love a trackball and respect the trackball.
6785106	6786387	Oh, fuck yeah.
6786507	6788847	This game is damn near impossible without a trackball.
6789088	6790288	I mean, that's just how it is.
6791028	6792209	So, yeah, Marble Madness.
6792629	6795230	But you have to play the level 2 music for me because it's the best.
6795270	6796630	I've just played it like five times.
6796650	6797470	Yeah, but I was talking.
6797530	6799071	You had so much to say about the game.
6803015	6804975	This is seriously like my favorite music.
6805095	6805836	Are you happy now?
6806336	6812877	I'll tell you the other thing I really like about this is that it reminds me of Wendy, what's her name, that did the Tron music.
6813277	6814057	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6814097	6816998	Because I've always loved that synth style.
6817258	6817738	FM synth.
6818578	6819118	Exactly.
6819298	6820339	I love it so much.
6821599	6822999	Why can't I remember her last name now?
6824799	6827160	Wendy, does it start with an O?
6830058	6852485	Wendy Carlos Wendy Carlos, okay It's C-O It's an arched letter It made me think a lot of Wendy Carlos' music Well, I mean, it came out two years after Tron So I could definitely see there being influence in the music And even that grid style If you notice the colors in some of the levels in that style I see some Tron influence, so
6853146	6869752	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Marble Madness, definitely a classic, and you can certainly find that in collections, like I think that Midway game I had on the PS3 for a little bit had that in it, but again, you know, thumbstick versus trackball, not the same, sorry to say.
6870410	6873151	There's another successor that she didn't mention.
6873611	6885333	I'm pretty sure I even called into OLR about this like five years ago because a buddy of mine had a copy of this and I've never played it since and I really want to called Kororinpa Marble Mania.
6886193	6897496	We exclusive, you play the game, I think it was Mario Galaxy or Mario Galaxy 2 when your character jumps on like a big bowling ball and goes down a track.
6898056	6904964	What the game tells you to do is take the Wiimote and put the bottom in the palm of your hand and treat it like an arcade stand of joystick kind of thing.
6905585	6909149	Kororimpa uses that control method exactly.
6909890	6911151	I forgot about Kororimpa.
6911171	6912473	It's surprisingly fun.
6912533	6914195	I actually have that game.
6914235	6917078	It is totally a Marble Madness biting, but it's great.
6917598	6918459	and DarkSakura.
6935815	6939057	Anyway, there's plenty more Orange Laundry to come.
6939077	6941619	I hope you all brought your sleeping bags because it's going all night tonight.
6941679	6949763	No, we will try to tear through the news in the second half quickly so we can get to your calls, your emails, the FUs of the week, FUBU Question of the Week, and so much more.
6949803	6951865	When we come back, plenty more Orange Laundry to come.
6952265	6952865	Stay tuned.
6952885	6953806	We'll be back right after this.
6960290	6972667	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday night December the 1st of 2013 I cannot believe it is already December and we're almost to 2014 Episode number 529 of our show I cannot believe we have done 529 episodes of this show
6976912	6977132	Fantasian
7002429	7003070	Oh yeah, Fantasia.
7003090	7006993	You were saying something about where's that Xbox One game Fantasia that was supposed to be out?
7007354	7009115	I was actually wondering that exact same thing the other day.
7009135	7010637	It got delayed to 2014.
7011057	7013039	Fantasia, the music evolved from Harmonix.
7014100	7015161	I was like, when did that happen?
7015561	7016622	Just kind of out of the blue, I guess.
7017919	7021742	Yeah, I haven't seen anything from Microsoft on that.
7021862	7027466	Of course, a lot of their first party titles... Well, I should say only one of their first party titles actually got delayed as well.
7027566	7028366	Oh, really?
7028847	7030948	Well, it was Kinect Sports.
7031809	7032469	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7032589	7032949	That's right.
7032989	7034611	But weren't they doing like a demo thing?
7034651	7035831	They have a demo thing going on right now.
7035851	7038113	Yeah, like what Nintendo did with the Wii Sports remake.
7038553	7040114	But yeah, that's been delayed.
7040274	7043777	I think it was delayed just because there's a big gap in titles coming out.
7044297	7045238	Like I said, you know...
7046844	7057717	After this week, you know what, next week is a couple, is a Vita game and a PlayStation 3 title that's been delayed forever, Painkiller.
7057817	7061642	You know what, do what DarkSakura's doing, do one game a week to help get caught up on your backlog.
7061922	7063404	Yep, at least, you know, look at them.
7064997	7066138	PrettyBox This Is It
7088137	7092900	Yes, in fact, I was just checking to see if they had them online, but it hasn't been updated yet.
7093420	7094761	Try Tuesday.
7095281	7102586	Yeah, there's going to be some more stuff being added to PlayStation Plus for December, including Borderlands 2 and Grid 2.
7103146	7104247	Those will be coming as well.
7106989	7128984	and then on let's see here oh and Dyad is also going to be coming to play free as well I remember hearing about the game but I don't remember what it is exactly but it's supposed to be good and then I think that was the one that was supposed to be sort of like like Geometry Wars maybe
7131899	7135881	I'm trying to look it up real quick because it sounds familiar to me too.
7138802	7141603	It's a tunnel racing puzzle shooting game is what they call it.
7142003	7143864	Okay, well then it's nothing like Geometry Wars.
7144524	7145465	It sounds cool though.
7145485	7146145	I like that description.
7146165	7146765	I'll check that out.
7147426	7155329	Then for Vita, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transform for the Vita and Urban Trial Freestyle.
7157591	7158171	Pretty awesome.
7158531	7159592	So that's coming out.
7159972	7169375	And then to be fair, I think on the Xbox front, I know Gears of War is going to be one of the free games.
7169415	7174257	I don't remember the Xbox Live Arcade title that's also with that, though.
7175858	7178659	But yeah, Gears of War 1 coming.
7181400	7181760	And then...
7183399	7210223	Saints Row 4 getting some DLC pretty soon actually I think next week or on the 11th and they're gonna have to save Santa Claus from the simulation so how the Saints save Christmas and it will come with of course as I predicted a Christmas themed dubstep gun and then a bunch of other you know things reindeer jingle bells jingle bells jingle bells
7212248	7212768	Pretty much.
7213409	7219832	Yeah, it's part of the Season Pass or $6.99 if you wait until December.
7220332	7225475	I will have you know, though, if you do buy the Season Pass, I think right now it's on sale for 66% off.
7225875	7233539	It's like $5 right now or, you know, on Steam, so it might be worth picking that up if you're curious, I guess.
7233999	7235200	Okay, Jason, I got it.
7235240	7235560	You ready?
7235600	7235880	You ready?
7236540	7239782	Come, they told me, pum.
7239842	7240963	Wub, wub, wub, pum.
7244408	7244648	Huh?
7244788	7245349	You like that?
7245430	7245770	That was good.
7245790	7246812	I'm going to put out an album.
7246952	7247453	Swear to God.
7248395	7248976	Wub wub wub.
7248996	7249958	Wub wub wub.
7250379	7250960	Wub wub wub.
7250980	7251100	Oh, God.
7256767	7260630	And then some great news, and definitely coming very soon.
7261050	7266794	In December, we will see the final PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto game coming to mobile.
7267495	7273118	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas getting an improved, I believe, slightly HD version.
7274379	7278442	That'll be coming out not sure when, but sometime this month.
7279163	7282625	Supposed to be on iOS and Android and Windows Mobile.
7283226	7285287	Of course, limited devices are going to be able to run that, but
7285447	7286067	Fuck, man.
7286207	7293269	San Andreas is like one of the best PlayStation 2 era Grand Theft Auto games and that's just all sorts of awesome.
7293469	7302692	Now, I hope that that means now that they have all these sort of HD-ified Grand Theft Auto games that we get some sort of triple pack for like Xbox Live Arcade or something like that.
7303072	7304052	That would be amazing.
7305373	7305553	Oh, yeah.
7325270	7326971	Hatsune Miku Project Diva Dingo
7350066	7351226	Awesome.
7351267	7362051	The game will take place after Persona 4, the Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold, and Tetsuya Komuro and Daisuke Asakura and some other musicians will be doing the background music for the game.
7362431	7371834	Some of the games in the game will include Pursuing My True Self, Heaven, Reach Out to the Truth, Time to Make History, and True Story, which were all songs that were in Persona 4 and Persona 4 Golden.
7372334	7373395	So, awesome.
7373415	7374895	Now the song list is starting to take shape.
7375035	7375176	So...
7376676	7377877	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7400074	7402956	Where Shane Alinko is mind blown.
7403676	7406057	Something gaming is happening in Wichita, go figure.
7406417	7410380	But yeah, Wichita game developer's name is Davis Sickman Jr.
7411740	7419424	He's raising some money with a Kickstarter to try to revive the Jumpman games for iPhone, iPad, Android, PC, Mac, and Ouya.
7420905	7422146	So that's pretty cool.
7422186	7427068	Jumpman, of course, originally created by Randy Glover for the Atari and the old school PCs and Commodore 64.
7428569	7434713	Jumpman Forever Nothing ever works out 2049 What if they did a crossover game that was Doodle Jumpman?
7456839	7458100	There's potential, you never know.
7458300	7463343	Alright, you know there's a lot of potential in the awesome game Typing of the Dead Overkill.
7463863	7465584	Heck yes, this game is a lot of fun.
7465624	7471027	I played it again with, speaking of Shane in Wichita, played this online this past week.
7471427	7476130	And the one thing we didn't get to do unfortunately was try the brand new DLC that was released this week.
7476510	7478751	The Shakespeare DLC pack.
7479291	7484214	That's right, for $3 you can get all the typing in the game changed to lines as Shakespeare.
7484614	7494127	To Thine O's Self, Quintessence of Dust, and Bellows Mender So you can actually type shit here Do we get the line about the bunghole from Hamlet?
7494568	7497051	Anything is possible, DarkSakura You know what a bunghole is, right?
7498853	7499154	For real
7500111	7500892	DarkSakura
7515251	7515611	Dang it.
7516012	7518034	I was actually looking at the email.
7519335	7523819	Well, there is a website now open for the Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary.
7524359	7525900	So you can go look at it.
7526021	7530424	I'm sure you can just hunt it down by looking up Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary site.
7530785	7534628	But it has some teasing on there too.
7534688	7535329	What could it be?
7535669	7536109	We don't know.
7537631	7538491	Moving forward...
7542661	7549927	Atlas is basically free to look at any of Sega's old IPs, any of their dormant ones.
7550527	7556232	So you know that could be Panzer Dragoon, that could be Jet Set Radio, that could be Shenmue.
7559134	7559895	So who knows?
7560495	7561496	Or it could just be Streets of Rage.
7562197	7565319	By the way, there's that silver lining I mentioned earlier about Shenmue.
7566220	7569903	They should make a spin-off game where the main character is a cow and they call it Shenmue.
7570835	7572077	and more.
7573258	7573518	Okay.
7574940	7581086	So, and then, now this, I actually sat and watched freaking footage for almost two hours watching this thing today.
7581887	7585170	And this one, I'm going to go ahead and just give the link to this.
7585190	7586532	This is on shoryuken.com.
7588794	7589875	Ultra Street Fighter 4...
7592878	7595540	is at Super Arcade in Walnut, California.
7596341	7599724	And it is basically location testing.
7601005	7606549	But there is a two-hour just play of some of the different characters that are in it.
7606589	7611793	We have T-Hawk, we have Rolento, we have Elena, Makoto, and Poison.
7612513	7619879	I was actually very happily surprised at just how much more balanced some of the gameplay seems in it.
7620639	7624343	Um, but you can, uh, watch, uh, the footage.
7624363	7627185	Uh, there's a link following from Shoryuken.com, so go look at it.
7630308	7630668	Alright.
7631248	7631549	Awesome.
7632089	7637734	Lots of, uh, I would, I would think this would be a dead period for gaming news, but we still got a lot of good stuff going on out there.
7638234	7641057	Let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.
7641077	7641217	Okay.
7648764	7652729	You take Facebook and you take Google+, and you slam those words together, you get FOOGLE!
7652869	7663560	And it's our FOOGLE question of the week, posted on both our communities, over at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and our Google Plus community at Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
7663981	7666744	Or you know what, if you put Orange Lounge Radio on Google, you'll find it.
7667064	7667525	It comes right up.
7667945	7668786	Anyway, um...
7670147	7687803	I'm only going to be able to read a couple I'm trying to buy us back some time since our interview went long but with great reason it was a great interview but I'm going to try to buy back some time here so I'm not going to read a lot of answers but I really want to encourage you to read because there were some great answers to this so here it is earlier this week one popular web blog for Apple fans made the claim
7688903	7698847	While the previous game console generation was all about motion controls, it's clear that the new machines will use second screen functionality and apps as major weapons of war.
7704549	7709591	Now that all the AAA players are on the field, what do you feel was the majority theme of the last generation?
7709971	7711772	What might the theme of the next generation be?
7712092	7716974	More motion, second screens, VR, AR, more 3D, and so on.
7717194	7722036	And a fact you guys may not have known, this question today coming from Jason actually invented this question.
7722336	7724757	Jason, do you want to elaborate on this at all before I read some of the answers?
7725057	7726078	Um, just...
7727019	7732425	Nothing terribly to elaborate on, I just don't think that second screen is going to wind up making any sort of significant dent.
7732806	7742778	I think the apps are getting better and they're going to exist, but as far as that being this year's motion, that's not going to be nearly all it's cracked up to be.
7743439	7743639	All right.
7743879	7745380	Well, let's look at some of the answers again.
7745400	7746701	I've really got to abbreviate this tonight.
7746781	7757448	Please, please, please go read the responses in full because there's some great ones, including this one on Google Plus from Colin M who says, Last gen felt like the Me Too generation.
7757968	7761731	The Wii introduced motion controls and Sony was like, Me Too with the six axis.
7762111	7764192	Microsoft at least tried something new with the Kinect.
7764652	7768435	I think that I just got to say, I really like that answer.
7768815	7774337	because, I mean, for real, because, I mean, I'm not having to read the second half yet, but I was like, you know what?
7774697	7775777	Damn, if that ain't right.
7775957	7780219	It does feel like everybody was kind of stealing the good ideas from each other.
7780259	7783720	Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, that's just competition, but you, like...
7785620	7794604	I couldn't go back to even the PlayStation 1 and Sega's Saturn era and talk about that was a Me Too generation.
7794624	7795245	It really wasn't.
7795365	7795985	Optical media.
7796265	7801247	Yeah, but that's... Ooh, a new format which is leagues above and better of all the cartridges ever.
7801447	7811872	That's not Me Too in the way that that E3 a couple years ago when they debuted the Kinect and the Sony move, you were sitting there going, wow, they're just after Nintendo's weave, aren't they?
7812612	7814273	So, you know, it's very interesting.
7814313	7816554	Anyway, let me read the rest of Colin's answer here on Google+.
7817015	7820216	I think the defining feature of this new gen will be social interaction.
7820737	7826180	Both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have activity feeds a la Facebook to show you what your friends are doing.
7826560	7828581	Even the Wii U has that plaza of sorts.
7828942	7831463	Then they're sharing videos of the games and live streaming.
7831523	7836806	Seamless multiplayer experiences such as Watch Dogs will blur the line between single player and multiplayer gaming.
7837186	7839748	This next gen will be all about other people.
7840228	7841569	Jason, you made a motion.
7841789	7842189	I agree.
7842289	7842749	Yes, sir.
7842889	7859558	That's exactly what my prediction for this generation is going to be, is that last year was better graphics, denser media, mostly, and motion controls, yes, and except in the case of Wii, mostly, cementing the online marketplace and online interactivity.
7860398	7878108	I have a very strong feeling that this generation, also in PC land, is going to be not just developing a title, updating it, and moving on, but it's going to be more socially geared with your friends, but also gaming communities.
7879088	7882490	Do you know how much new Borderlands 2 content there is?
7882870	7886052	Do you know how much new Diablo content there is?
7887713	7894037	All of these games are geared with the capability of tacking new content on continuously.
7894498	7897640	In my opinion, microtransactions be damned.
7898400	7905529	3D makes my head hurt, motion control frustrates me, it makes me break a sweat, and I'm almost positive VR would make me throw up.
7905569	7906410	So let's stick to buttons.
7916341	7937240	gripping and movie quality storylines and gameplay that pushes the limits of what we have already seen or felt so far as for second screen bring it on I love how well the Vita and PS3 play together can't wait to get my PS4 love my Wii U and the new PlayStation app they added is a great step in the right direction for Sony so instead of mobiles attempt to take over consoles let's make a baby and all get along
7938757	7940199	So that is Travis' prediction.
7940379	7941100	Let's make a baby.
7941900	7942641	And I'll get along.
7943482	7943742	Love it.
7944403	7947606	Those answers from Google+, but there's about six other answers there if you want to check that out.
7947686	7949328	We can call it the X4U.
7951510	7953813	Going to Facebook.
7954414	7955775	Let's read some answers here on Facebook.
7955815	7959459	You know, I might be being partial here, but I really like this answer from Extafirm.
7959979	7960780	our buddy from Horde House.
7961220	7963702	Extrover over on Facebook says, Let's make a baby, right?
7984441	7990804	Let's read another answer here from Ricardo V who says, I don't think the last generation was about motion controls.
7991224	7994065	Maybe the marketing makes it look that way because it was the new thing.
7994485	7997927	But at the end, I think it was more about giving a cinematic feel to games.
7998367	8002169	Lots of scripted events, animations of characters with the environment as you played, etc.
8002549	8007051	Clear examples of that are games like Uncharted, The Last of Us, and Bioshock Infinite.
8007911	8018520	I still don't have a new console but I think we started seeing what the new gen is about in the previous gen integration of indie games into the consoles multitasking and cloud and digital content
8019867	8020347	Good answer.
8020407	8021428	I like that too.
8021508	8035918	And certainly, even though I think you saw it a little bit with PlayStation 2, just that when you talk about cinematic feel, certainly the budgets are starting to get up there where it's like you're making three movies when you make a video game just with what goes into it.
8035958	8039501	So I definitely think that took off, especially those games you cited there.
8040561	8043222	Let's do one more answer from Facebook.
8043242	8045363	I'm going to do this one from Andy R who said,
8062148	8065570	We're playing the game online could change or enhance the gameplay experience.
8066090	8070313	Now with games like Watch Dogs or Destiny, the theme seems to be continuing.
8087583	8093950	We're going to get back into some long-form news, but if you have more thoughts on this topic, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is a great place to send it to.
8094410	8094670	Loki.
8095711	8105902	I was going to say also, yeah, I definitely don't think motion control is... I think the problem with motion control, and this is even going to be something going into next year with Kinect and stuff, is just... It's a gimmick.
8106142	8108745	It's just like, remember when they had the vision camera?
8109085	8109425	Yeah.
8110967	8116552	It's a gimmick that sold more copies of Wii Sports than any other video game in history.
8116572	8118173	No, I'm not saying that we did it wrong.
8118454	8121557	We had the right idea because their whole console is based on that in the beginning.
8122157	8124760	And, you know, that was fine and that worked.
8125260	8128903	I'm talking about the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
8129444	8129984	It did not work.
8130024	8130605	It was a fad.
8130745	8134408	And I honestly think... Did you just make a pro Nintendo statement versus the other two?
8134428	8134469	No.
8135169	8135929	I've always said that.
8137270	8137710	I'm just saying.
8137730	8138170	It's just funny.
8155917	8159278	I just don't think it's something that we're going to see implemented well into games.
8159678	8164339	You may get a couple games that implement it well, but aside from that, just look what they've done with Kinect.
8164459	8166260	It's voice commands for shit.
8166520	8171041	Or it's FIFA detecting that you're cursing so they can flag you.
8171201	8172521	Why the fuck would you want that?
8173021	8174582	I just don't know why anyone would want that.
8174602	8175722	I don't know.
8176212	8183800	Anyways, okay, so let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One since I mentioned Kinect.
8184581	8194972	You may remember last week we talked a little bit about how the Xbox One had some issues with some of the consoles that, hey, there was disk drive sounding like it was shredding the disk.
8195893	8197075	At least that's what it sounded like.
8197815	8205241	And it was an issue and I said, you know, they really should come out and address the issue and figure out a way to appease customers and stuff like that.
8205261	8205862	So that's what they did.
8205962	8209465	They went ahead and said, you know what, they're going to replace the console.
8209525	8215069	What's kind of great about it is if you call in and say, hey, you know, my console's all fucked up.
8215670	8219072	What they're going to do is give you a free digital version of one of the Xbox One launch titles.
8219092	8223936	So either Forza, Rise of the Rome, Dead Rising 3, or Zoo Tycoon.
8224637	8224737	Um...
8225297	8230964	and you get to keep your console until the replacement console arrives and you send the replacement console back.
8231845	8245160	So I thought that's a pretty decent way to make up for those drive issues and I haven't heard too much more about it this week so I'm assuming that it was indeed a very small number of consoles that were affected by it.
8246441	8248763	Well, thank God that it's not so widespread.
8249444	8251366	I think that they learned their lesson the last time.
8252587	8254568	They do not want to make that mistake again.
8255589	8256010	No kidding.
8256770	8258532	Well, this could get very interesting.
8258872	8262295	Could EA be working on an open world Star Wars game?
8262715	8271162	Some recent job listings apparently point to this, which of course makes me raise an eyebrow and go, but I thought they already had a Star Wars MMO called The Old Republic.
8271923	8286812	but perhaps something new to tie in with the new games or maybe not even necessarily an MMO but an animation director being hired for EA Canada for quote a major new next gen open world action game in a beloved sci-fi property.
8287252	8288293	Sounds like Battlefront to me.
8288894	8289454	Yeah, maybe?
8289634	8290675	Hmm.
8290715	8300040	There's also an executive producer position and a lead combat designer position, which apparently was also linked to a Star Wars property because a recruiter said something on Twitter.
8300140	8300460	I don't know.
8300860	8311845	But anyway, apparently this goes back to when Avalanche Studios was working with LucasArts, or almost signed up with LucasArts to do an open world Star Wars game around 2007.
8311885	8311925	Oh.
8313306	8315088	Oh my god, that would have been so amazing.
8315308	8317030	And then, you guys remember Star Wars 1313?
8317090	8323555	That was something that was supposed to be... Disney Candid, if you didn't know, Disney closed developer, that halted the game.
8323656	8326598	Could that be the game that's being picked up and continued?
8326678	8327279	Question mark.
8327319	8327699	Who knows?
8328320	8331903	EA, of course, has the exclusive rights to develop and continue the Star Wars games.
8332203	8332303	So...
8333544	8338489	Something will happen by December 2015 when the new Star Wars movie comes out.
8338549	8339329	Guaranteed.
8339429	8343813	You know, Avalanche is the company behind Just Cause, which makes it very exciting.
8343993	8347796	And they also have the new Mad Max game coming out, so that could be very awesome.
8348077	8349738	I liked the trailer for that.
8350322	8370610	They know how to make a good multiplayer game Or new open world game So it's December 2013 now So you got two years to make it happen Sounds like they already got started So we'll see what happens Don't make me feel older Just think about how old we're gonna be When the new Star Wars movie finally comes out Or the Warcraft movie Do you know what is next year?
8371230	8375372	My 20th high school reunion Oh my gosh, wow Are you gonna go?
8376293	8379774	If someone gives me $400 for the plane ticket, yeah I'm gonna try to
8381186	8385588	My 10-year reunion was practically just downtown where I go all the time.
8385788	8386208	Didn't go.
8386548	8388849	Yeah, well, you're not from another state, rad.
8388909	8389909	I'm not, but I'm just saying.
8391290	8393190	My 10-year reunion was crap.
8393210	8394531	I don't think we had one for mine.
8394591	8395371	If we did, I didn't care.
8395551	8398712	Most people I want to keep in touch with, I still talk to on Facebook.
8398772	8399553	It was garbage.
8399573	8402874	Yeah, I actually keep up with some of those people now on Facebook.
8402974	8404254	And I'm like, you have kids.
8404675	8405295	I have a cat.
8406515	8407536	I love my cat.
8408377	8410218	High school was such a bad time.
8410458	8411739	In some ways it was good, in some ways it was bad.
8411779	8414762	I want to make it sound like poor me because we all had bad experiences, I'm sure.
8415662	8421607	But there's just some people from high school I would really love to go my entire life and just never see again.
8421647	8424069	I would be very happy with that.
8424514	8425656	I can sympathize with that.
8425696	8428780	I just want to bring Dan and have Dan.
8430062	8433968	And then like leave early like I did for Homecoming my senior year.
8433988	8436071	I was like, bye.
8436111	8436812	This place sucks.
8437073	8438034	Hey, don't I have a story to do?
8438094	8438435	Yes, you do.
8439502	8442265	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8459860	8464464	Actually, what he said is that, and this is a quote, I've been at Blizzard Entertainment for almost six years.
8464904	8471549	It has been epic, and I have made many friends around the world, and I've learned so much, but I have a great opportunity for something new and exciting.
8471989	8473511	Sadly, it is time to move on.
8473951	8475412	He's also going to Oculus...
8476733	8477913	No, we don't know.
8478153	8479174	There's a lot of tinfoil.
8479334	8483295	I mean, being on Horde House, I talk to a lot of Warcraft people.
8483655	8490136	There's some tinfoil hats in the community that he possibly went to Riot Games, maker of League of Legends, also in LA.
8490456	8495537	This is based on a total conspiracy theory about who he follows on Twitter, which is interesting.
8496438	8501679	But I mean, if he quit Warcraft to go to League of Legends, he'd just be like everybody else.
8502299	8511703	Yeah But I'm bummed Which is strange considering that Blizzard's new one is coming out Yeah, but the funny part is that it's not funny I know, alright Well, you know what?
8511863	8525668	People go and, you know, people moving from company to company usually isn't news But the thing about World of Warcraft, man Quasi-related question to that comment Do those conspiracy theories come from people in California or outside of California?
8526559	8527059	All over.
8527139	8528380	They come from the internet.
8528480	8545727	Well, it's a meaningful question to me because my coworkers, those that have lived in the Bay Area, you know, the better part of their lives, have a lot of friends at a lot of companies, either personally or professionally, including our competitors and everything else.
8546067	8548288	And, you know, yeah.
8549148	8550309	GitHub has competitors?
8550369	8551009	I didn't know that.
8551069	8552410	I kind of thought they did their own thing.
8553310	8553911	Very much no.
8554972	8558254	The detail is, the depth is infinite.
8559315	8563978	It's, you know, everybody has the this is better, this is worse, has the confrontational aspect of it.
8564058	8566260	And sure, that exists at a professional level as well.
8566761	8572065	But it's not, maybe I shouldn't rip back the veil, but it's not like...
8572945	8576850	Death threats and at odds ends with each other.
8576950	8585381	I mean, we just had a charity dodgeball game where our best friends at competing companies came out for a good cause as well.
8586322	8589286	Whenever we throw drink-ups, people from all of these companies come out.
8589386	8589867	It's not...
8591068	8595571	Yeah, professionally, it's competition, but that's healthy.
8595851	8598993	And the people that make it up are good people.
8599173	8606618	You know, for the short time that I interned at a local TV news station, because I was going to be just like Ron Burgundy one day, and here I am.
8607499	8617385	But I interned at a local TV station, and they would, about once every three months, there would be a big get-together of all the local news people from all, like NBC, CBS, all of them would just go have dinner.
8617405	8620007	It's not like they all hated each other.
8620347	8628896	because a lot of times, and especially look at your own local TV news, they trade people all the time and people go to jobs at other companies and it just, you know, something happens.
8629167	8631708	Yeah, this is industry.
8631748	8638612	This is why there's conventions, professional conventions, where all of these same people talk, discuss, and meet all the rest of these people.
8639413	8645856	And it's also why you don't truly have companies that just bicker back and forth in the same industry and are just at odds ends with people.
8645956	8647557	It's interesting.
8647797	8650679	It's interesting insight for me to have now as well.
8651619	8652920	Let's move on with some more stories, Loki.
8680362	8687267	Anyway, so there was a report that was done showing all the different games he played and stuff.
8687987	8697114	And unfortunately, even though with that profile and everything, it just didn't tie with the games at all.
8697734	8701758	He played video games often both solo, home, and online.
8702119	8704802	They can be described as both violent and non-violent.
8705382	8714912	One person described the shooter as spending the majority of his time playing non-violent video games all day, with one of his favorites at one point being Super Mario Bros.
8714932	8715913	There you go, Super Mario Bros.
8715953	8717055	causes mass murder.
8718196	8722719	Well, there was a... I'll let you finish because I'm about to drag a bit.
8723139	8725441	It's the shadow people that live on top of the cliff in the galaxy.
8725461	8726462	I'm about to drag a bit.
8726562	8742234	In conclusion, what we do know is the shooter had significant mental health issues while not affecting the criminality of the shooter's mental state for their crimes or his criminal responsibility for them did affect his ability to live a normal life and interact with others.
8742954	8768424	whom we should have been close with and um you know video games did not play a part in that so um yeah and it's funny as even though after that came out of course the NRA issued a statement blaming still um or actually no I'm sorry that this is referring back to the um the original thing where the NRA blamed it of course no traction on that um
8770499	8773052	No Retraction from the NRA about being wrong or anything
8775047	8803876	as they usually are I was looking at Twitter this week as I usually do during the day and I saw a link and I made the mistake of clicking on it even though I saw the name Kotaku in the URL and my eyes rolled so far to the back of my head I could see my fucking brain because they ran a story about how the Sandy Hook shooter his favorite game was Dance Dance Revolution and this guy played DDR all the time and da da da da da and all I could really think of I was just like Kotaku please shut the fuck up
8804756	8807158	Please, please shut up.
8808218	8808959	I saw these links.
8808999	8809859	I didn't read the article.
8809920	8813022	Surely they were making it tongue-in-cheek and making the same point that we are.
8813182	8819766	Which I'm just sitting here going, why are you perpetuating this whole – I mean it's kind of irresponsible.
8819806	8821167	It's clearly clickbait.
8821527	8834156	It's clearly this whole – and I'm not even saying this because I played DDR for years and years because unlike what you do when you run a story like this, I don't give this shit any credit at all.
8835036	8835476	Mental health
8859380	8859920	There's that too.
8860621	8861521	But that's speculation.
8862541	8865743	You know, I mean, it's just like... But with the state of... I hate to go into the politics of it.
8865883	8866223	I know.
8866583	8869464	But we don't give enough attention to mental health.
8870965	8872026	And background checks.
8872086	8873826	There's definitely a lot of stigma with that.
8874287	8876648	And we have to break down those walls a lot.
8876688	8882310	And I would agree with you there that, you know, clearly he had issues that weren't being addressed.
8882930	8883230	I don't know.
8883270	8886492	Trying to beat those nine-footers might frustrate someone into... No, I'm serious.
8887552	8892694	But yeah, so anyway, I'm just saying the ban on that website continues.
8892894	8898737	And, you know, shame on me for being dumb enough to click a link like that.
8898757	8900997	But I was just like, no, no, they could.
8901178	8902078	Oh, my God.
8902685	8904986	Every so often you have to confirm that yes, they're stupid.
8905126	8911150	Yeah, it's just kind of one of those like, Lord, get a... Anyhow, let's see.
8911350	8917793	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com SSJ100Matt says, basically this report answered no questions.
8920074	8920535	Let's see.
8920555	8923376	The Peggle Pervert.
8923816	8926318	The Peggle Pervert says, see how I chat.
8927278	8927739	Oh, Lord.
8927799	8928179	All right.
8929279	8929920	Let's move on.
8930440	8931060	More stories.
8931280	8932101	And I will go next.
8932261	8932942	D&D Devil Worshippers
8951300	8955483	Rob, you are not worshipping the devil, are you, Rob?
8955503	8956324	Is that what you're doing?
8956344	8957424	That's what they said on Oprah, Rob.
8957464	8958325	I love your mom.
8958665	8961087	Rob, don't play Dungeons and Dragons.
8962068	8962428	Rob.
8963929	8964570	That's what it was like.
8965090	8968032	They said on the 700 Club that that game leads to devil.
8968052	8971575	My parents didn't even watch that shit, so I don't even know how they got on board.
8972415	8974216	Or when they started caring if I worshipped Satan or not.
8974236	8977379	Did you hear that the guy that started the Trinity Broadcasting Network died?
8977899	8978380	No, I didn't.
8978661	8980123	Yeah, he died yesterday.
8981005	8982607	That Fast and Furious dude, too.
8983248	8986674	Yeah, I was going to say, all I heard about on Facebook was the guy from Fast and the Furious.
8986694	8988377	Yeah, but that guy died, too, and no one cared.
8988878	8989379	Well, because...
8991505	8994948	I'm not even going to finish my thought or I'm going to be a bad person.
8994988	8998451	So I'm just going to bite my tongue and talk about the PlayStation 4.
9000532	9001153	Yay!
9001733	9003214	Well, here's the thing about the PlayStation 4.
9003254	9004155	It may not last long.
9004776	9005476	Hold on, hold on.
9005496	9006137	I'm not trolling.
9006437	9006977	Here's the thing.
9007698	9008358	There was a comment.
9009379	9035312	From Sony UK boss Fergal Gara Because of course the PlayStation just launched in the UK this week So there's a lot of stuff in the media over there this week And Fergal Gara made a very interesting comment saying I think there's reasons to believe that the next cycle might be shorter in markets such as the UK It's probably a sign of the times and how much has changed in seven years But I think the willingness and the appetite to pick up new technology fast has probably changed quite a bit
9035672	9039095	So all this coming down to, will the PS4 be a 10 year life cycle?
9039175	9039675	Maybe not.
9039935	9040456	Horseshit.
9042457	9042738	Please.
9043298	9045520	And this is going back to the question of the week.
9046421	9048722	And this is a question I've had in my mind for a very long time.
9049123	9055488	As far as a new console, a new technology, and an overhaul, what the hell else are they going to do?
9057129	9072910	The visual aspect and quality of video games has improved dramatically, and considering that unless everybody box on 4K and rolls that into a new technology, there's no visual dramatic changes that they can make in the next five years.
9072950	9081060	Jason, I want to say yes, but when I was 12 years old and saw Super Nintendo Mode 7 for the first time, I was like, it's so fucking real.
9081380	9083082	It'll never get more real than that.
9083543	9084404	Oh, my God.
9084424	9085585	So cool.
9085605	9088248	But that is a terrible comparison.
9088268	9088569	Yeah.
9089743	9092244	Fuck you too!
9092284	9095684	The quality standard is cinema slash real life.
9096605	9098545	It's one step closer to the holodeck, Jason.
9098725	9099825	That's what we always say on the show.
9099965	9102186	Every console is one step closer to the holodeck.
9102206	9103886	But that would be a different technology.
9103926	9106667	That's not just a graphical improvement, which is what I'm claiming right now.
9106947	9114649	But there's nothing that can take that mantle in the next generation to make the PS4's lifecycle be less than four or five years.
9114669	9116469	Microsoft Lightroom, Jason.
9116869	9120271	It's going to holodeck your walls.
9121451	9129815	The difference would be moving from a... I don't really think you can use the holodeck as a graphical comparison.
9130476	9131116	This is what I'm saying.
9131316	9132257	One step closer, Jamie.
9132317	9134238	We're not going to be at the holodeck the next generation.
9134258	9136038	It would be awesome if we were.
9137039	9139900	A more apt comparison would be... Shut up.
9141741	9145263	Would be leaving your monitor for a holographic interface.
9147199	9148560	Well, that's what they have in the Hunger Games.
9152141	9153562	That was the correct reaction.
9154722	9156603	The end game can only be one thing.
9156623	9157884	I hope I didn't break the mic.
9158324	9161045	Listen, the end game can only be one thing.
9161785	9165247	And that's where the boobies become real and you can put your penis in it.
9165347	9168948	That is really the end game that anyone can expect.
9169028	9171209	Because where do you need to go beyond that?
9171449	9172210	Nowhere.
9172250	9172890	You don't need to go anywhere.
9172910	9174491	Not everybody is interested in that.
9174551	9174951	Thank you.
9176027	9178009	I understand that, but that's going to be the end game.
9179270	9180891	I want fluffy kitties.
9181311	9183213	I want to be able to pet the kitties in the game.
9183653	9185394	As do I, but I'm just saying.
9185434	9186235	There will be a switch.
9186255	9187076	There will be pussy.
9188637	9191959	There will be a switch, just like on the old Atari 2600 game select.
9192019	9193641	There will be boobie and kitty.
9193961	9194862	And then, of course, you know, no pants.
9195362	9195862	And ferret mode.
9198757	9199197	Moving on.
9201118	9201458	All right.
9202359	9205720	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, one step closer to the edge and it's about to break.
9206040	9207261	Just like this show.
9208482	9211463	We've been one step to the edge since episode three, okay?
9211603	9212504	And I wasn't even here.
9213964	9214765	DarkSakura.
9215005	9216145	I was sleeping in a closet.
9216225	9217166	Read a story, damn it.
9217386	9218046	You know what, Rob?
9219067	9219627	Pet the pussy.
9221848	9222848	I was just reading chat room.
9222948	9223629	Come here, Sanrio.
9223669	9224769	She came out for a little bit.
9224789	9225470	I was surprised.
9226750	9227691	DarkSakura said to pet you.
9228482	9240537	Now this is one thing that is super cool, if we can get away from the bullshittery of, you know, fake reporting and all the gun violence and pussies.
9240557	9241518	Everybody.
9241558	9241999	Everybody.
9242401	9245121	Those two last statements do go well together.
9245321	9245722	You know what?
9245742	9246082	Whatever.
9246782	9253923	I was trying to tie it in, but I'm so flustered right now because of the Cyber Monday event for Rosetta Stone ad that's on this page.
9254663	9255423	No, seriously.
9255983	9269646	There are a team of neuroscientists at the University of Pennsylvania and Friedberg University that are using video games where people go through virtual towns, basically just delivering... Oh, you know what?
9269666	9271246	It sounds like they're using fucking Animal Crossing.
9272326	9293128	but I mean they're going around and delivering stuff in these locations in the game but they're looking at how the brain encodes spatial information to form I guess location tags for memories and basically there's actually a mental technique I don't know if anyone's ever heard of something called the mind palace
9294729	9314137	basically where for you to remember certain information you visualize rooms in a palace and it's mapping it's using spatial mapping to instead trigger a memory and it sounds like this is sort of what they're doing but they're also using this more as a study for epilepsy
9315117	9315958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9335916	9345141	And I know for me in particular, and I know I haven't been overly verbal on this, but at the end of January I was diagnosed with autism.
9346221	9349923	I'm not going to go repeat myself a bajillion times and kill people.
9350103	9351044	No, that doesn't happen.
9352004	9363313	Um, the whole thing too is that it's actually been how I remember a lot of stuff is by remembering visually what, where I was, what I did.
9363633	9372420	I couldn't remember the name of this one shop for the record until I was standing at Ikea facing the direction that the shop was in and then I remembered the name of it, for example.
9373061	9376984	You know, so it's, it's definitely got a bit of a
9378638	9379359	A definite interest.
9379379	9392377	I mean, we're talking about that Mind Palace technique having been a mental memory building tool that's been in existence since before the current era.
9392537	9394039	It's been in existence for...
9395400	9396161	Thanks for watching!
9412208	9413028	Games doing good.
9413068	9417569	I appreciate a story like that after the fuckery we had a couple stories ago.
9418509	9419389	There's another thing, too.
9420489	9423390	I'm just going to read this because it is kind of technical, but I'm going to quote it.
9424910	9434812	It says, During navigation, neurons in the hippocampus and neighboring regions can often represent the patient's virtual location within the town, kind of like a brain GPS device.
9435372	9441273	These so-called play cells are perhaps the most striking example of a neuron that encodes an abstract cognitive representation.
9441653	9448518	So basically where they're visualizing themselves in their game environment is where their mind is visualizing the data that they're researching too.
9449038	9456483	So again, there's a tie between how we think what we remember and how we access our memories.
9456523	9457984	I think it's fantastic that they're doing this.
9458024	9458804	And hi, Sanrio.
9459965	9460225	Kitty.
9460645	9461706	No, she's in the living room.
9462438	9462858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9477074	9479957	Yeah, and I think that some... No, there was only one.
9480657	9481598	So I'll read it.
9482379	9484240	Hello, Olari-ees.
9485521	9489004	I have a fairly decent income, and the purchase of both systems really hit my savings hard.
9489785	9494729	I can see why most everyone will only get one of either the PS4 or the Xbox One.
9495329	9500594	I think they are both solid and with good games, but I like the games on the Xbox One a little better.
9500994	9503837	I think I can sum up my comparison of the systems with an analogy.
9504497	9508360	The PlayStation is like someone handing out candy to everyone in the form of a roll of Mentos.
9508800	9512143	The Xbox is like someone grabbing handfuls of candy and throwing them into a crowd.
9512423	9513103	So it's like Mardi Gras.
9513924	9515245	Enjoy and remember to brush your teeth.
9515405	9515785	Rababa.
9517547	9517907	Yes, sir.
9517927	9518668	I will brush my teeth.
9519188	9519869	I love Rababa.
9521450	9525473	I wish I could have been in the situation where I could buy both consoles this year.
9525573	9528675	If I wasn't in debt after my last Disneyland trip, I would.
9528835	9530977	I'd like to be in the position where I can just go to Disneyland.
9532262	9533143	Soon, soon.
9534384	9535805	All right.
9535865	9540128	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to make some crazy analogies on the show in the future.
9540548	9541169	It would be awesome.
9542069	9543691	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
9544171	9551477	Now is the part of the show where we get a little bit angry, even though, you know, there's been a lot of happy stuff tonight.
9552457	9557161	We have to balance that with some anger and rawr because FUs of the week.
9573291	9579932	I am actually not very angry today, except for, I mean, the usual stuff.
9580813	9581953	So yeah, I guess I'm pretty angry.
9582173	9582573	Not really.
9583033	9584433	I'm angry on behalf of Becky.
9585074	9593695	I'm very glad that I did not get hired where she is employed at, and I cannot go into more detail because I was advised of a lot in confidence.
9594436	9595656	But, um, fuck that place.
9595716	9596296	Fuck it a lot.
9598685	9599626	Um, if that's it.
9599646	9617701	Oh, and also, fuck Bitchface Vicky, who was my ex-boss, who sold the company to the current place, for, um, and I heard about this, so again, not something I can prove and just nail her ass to the wall about, but for apparently bad-mouthing me to the current owner of the company, because she couldn't handle it.
9618582	9619823	She thinks I was trying to ruin her business.
9620043	9622806	You know what, if I was trying to ruin your business, it would have been gone before you sold it.
9624127	9625327	You didn't change your passwords.
9625547	9625967	Duh.
9626387	9627868	All right, Loki.
9628668	9631048	Thank you, Rob, for not playing Grand Theft Auto V yet.
9631789	9633669	It's only $39.99 on Amazon.
9634389	9634809	Really?
9635189	9635929	On PS3?
9635949	9636450	On PS3.
9639270	9644511	F you to Loki for trying to get me to spend more money when I already spent too much on goddamn Steam sales.
9644571	9646031	But at least all the Steam games are really good.
9646332	9647172	I can't be too upset.
9648072	9648312	Jason.
9649983	9668854	I was going to say that I'm happy little bunny this week, and that's mostly true, but amusingly and perhaps not at all surprisingly enough to last week's FU, I'm having a weird snafu with the parking garage that I'm in right now, and people are being very silly and blaming me for something...
9670455	9677920	I'm sure there's a dresser or something at the end of my parking spot and people are telling me to move the extra three inches in.
9678520	9681122	That dresser is not ours.
9681322	9683383	It's not part of our unit.
9683584	9687226	So I need to figure out whose it is so I can actually pull in the whole way to the parking lot.
9689324	9689544	Alright.
9689584	9696789	Which, you know, San Francisco-type parking, you can understand how being even that much further away from your normal spot would be detrimental, admittedly.
9697630	9698691	Parking in San Francisco?
9699111	9699571	Oh my god.
9699891	9700252	Terror.
9700852	9701212	Terror.
9701272	9701433	Yes.
9702613	9702914	Alright.
9703134	9703934	F you to terror.
9704755	9705996	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
9706456	9706696	Loki.
9706976	9710479	Speaking of terror, Lindsay Lohan...
9713104	9737400	Segue of the year goes to Lindsay Lohan is now allegedly suing Rockstar Games over GTA 5 because there is, you know, the whole game takes place in like a Hollywood environment and there's, you know, different celebrities and stuff that you run into and, you know, they act very cliche like some of these celebrities might.
9737760	9741723	But she thinks that one of those characters is directly based off of her
9743405	9744185	Good luck with that.
9744766	9747207	Because, um... No.
9747967	9748127	No.
9748228	9750249	Don't we have, like, laws for parody?
9750329	9765997	It's absolutely parody, and there's not a character that's just exactly... It's all of the different, you know, female celebrities that are... On the flip side, how much do we actually believe that Lindsay Lohan would be suing a frickin' video game?
9766037	9766777	I mean, really?
9766797	9766917	Really?
9769964	9771325	Besides that, parody is protected.
9771445	9775246	I just want to make sure this news isn't coming from Kotaku, is it?
9775266	9776706	Because it sounds like the type of story they'd write.
9776726	9778607	I don't know if it's better or worse.
9780188	9780788	Oh, never mind.
9781008	9782428	It's coming from TMZ.
9783229	9783989	Oh, God.
9785489	9786650	Oh, God.
9786670	9790451	Well, it's just probably why everyone doubted the... It's about the same level.
9790671	9792192	...death reporting yesterday, too.
9792212	9792772	Yeah, yeah.
9793912	9794973	So, all right.
9794993	9798594	Well, if TMZ reported it, Loki, it must be true, so...
9799167	9808497	Yes, she's claiming that, I love that, I'm going to direct quote this because of their wording, claiming that video game honchos jacked her image without her permission.
9809518	9810900	Who uses honcho anymore?
9811060	9813903	Apparently, somebody does.
9815084	9816766	Some TMZ staffer.
9818712	9819973	Well, whatever to that.
9820313	9823474	Good luck, Lindsay Lohan, and good luck, TMZ.
9823514	9824735	You're both going to need it.
9825555	9828476	Also, good luck to all of you that were awaiting this new console.
9828516	9831297	This actually sounded really awesome, and I was looking forward to this.
9831377	9842502	I was hoping to maybe pick one up at some point, but it's going to have to wait until next year because the Retron 5 console, or the Retro N, I think Retron's a better name, but Retro N or whatever, the Retro N5 console is...
9842782	9843863	Faulty Pins Discovered in Some Packaged Units
9869105	9873910	Well, at least they're doing the right thing and pulling it and fixing the problem as opposed to selling some crap units.
9874470	9878854	So, unfortunately, if you were hoping to get one on its release date, December 10th, too bad.
9879134	9879435	You won't.
9880616	9880856	All right.
9882097	9882437	There it is.
9882517	9887082	That's it for the news we had in our show role tonight, but we are going to open up the sky blind.
9887122	9888803	We're actually kind of on schedule, too, now.
9888903	9891666	Yeah, we made up the time there in Part B. Are you okay, Alan?
9893012	9893752	Oh, I thought he fell.
9893792	9894353	I thought he tripped.
9894373	9895433	Didn't it sound like he tripped in there?
9895453	9895994	A little bit.
9896034	9896334	I don't know.
9896354	9897014	I was like, oh, my God.
9897715	9899115	I'm going to have to call 911 mid-show.
9899195	9899456	All right.
9899476	9903958	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number, or you can call us on Skype.
9904178	9911442	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, is the place to give us a call if you want to be on the show to talk about whatever we talked about tonight or maybe something that we missed.
9911482	9911842	Who knows?
9912243	9921868	But while we wait for the calls to come in, Loki, I'll quickly call on you for any last-minute stories, and I'll go to our Twitter as well for any Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
9922248	9930994	I just wanted to mention again, you know, because I do like Just Cause and because the multiplayer, seriously, the videos in the multiplayer look fucking crazy.
9931455	9936418	So if you're interested, Just Cause 2, it's like $2.99 right now on Steam.
9936759	9937639	Totally worth it.
9937979	9941042	And then if you want to get into the Just Cause multiplayer beta...
9941782	9943163	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9967967	9968668	Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9979517	9980198	I'm good.
9980518	9981719	How about you good, sir?
9982119	9986643	I'm great, and I'm realizing with all the conventions you go to, I think I need to send you some of my balls.
9987423	9988064	Exactly.
9988104	9991607	I would use some of your balls and spread the love around.
9992367	9993468	Spread my balls all over.
9993488	9994128	That sounds like fun.
9994149	9996270	We'll just take Rob's balls and throw them at everyone.
9996630	9998192	To be fair, they're not actually my balls.
9998212	9999012	They're Grandpa's balls.
9999593	10000033	Yeah.
10000073	10001774	He gave them all to me.
10002715	10010260	I just want you to know, you should be thankful that Mako isn't listening right now because she'll be squeeing over the fact that she gets to play with your balls.
10013081	10014662	Hopefully she'll hear it on the podcast feed.
10014682	10016463	Well, it's a good thing they're not sweaty balls.
10018104	10030248	If you missed the first part of the show, Grandpa Matt from Horde House got a bunch of little hacky sacks with the VOG logo and website URL printed on them as giveaways for BlizzCon.
10030268	10037930	Well, he only gave about half of them away, so now we're going to pass them on to other VOG hosts and so forth to hand them out at later conventions.
10037990	10041111	So when we talk about our balls, they are balls!
10041826	10042526	They're kind of squishy.
10043187	10043827	They're fun to play with.
10043887	10045468	And our balls have balls.
10045708	10048209	Anyhow, I'm sure you didn't call in just to talk about balls.
10048709	10049530	What is on your mind?
10049770	10051010	That's what you... Sorry.
10051931	10056413	How do you know I didn't call... Well, surprise me.
10056513	10057653	Then let's talk balls.
10059269	10062692	No, no, no, did not come to talk balls.
10062712	10066135	A couple of things I want to talk about from tonight's discussion.
10067476	10071940	Now, I understand that OLR is a place where every person has their voice.
10072300	10079766	Now, in response to that one person who wrote in about how you guys are being biased towards one console.
10080167	10080527	Yes.
10081868	10084230	Shit happens.
10084270	10084851	Shit happens.
10085421	10095530	Yeah, I mean, on our podcast, we talk about different things, but sometimes we get on one topic or one company for a while, and it's like, well, that's what everybody is talking about.
10095810	10102616	Just because we're talking about it as well, that does not mean what we're saying is the same as everybody else.
10103637	10106700	Right, and I do want to remind you, it wasn't just one person.
10106740	10108041	I only read one thing on the air.
10108662	10110624	Yeah, and one thing is that
10112156	10114098	Everyone gets their turn in the barrel.
10114218	10119062	So, for that point, for a while, it was Xbox One's turn to be in the barrel.
10119803	10121885	That's how the news goes.
10122926	10124607	Yeah, I think that's very true.
10125007	10127369	The same thing happens in politics, right?
10127610	10133535	Sometimes it's the red team, or sometimes it's the blue team, or sometimes it's all of them, honestly.
10134055	10139300	So, it just kind of depends on what the public eye is watching.
10140031	10149136	Yes, like, for example, when Heroes of Cosplay was on TV, all the blogs, all the podcasts, all everybody was talking about was Heroes of Cosplay.
10149437	10157261	And then we're talking about it, but we're like, yeah, we watch it only because I'm drinking when I'm watching it and I'm giving my personal spin on it.
10157321	10161404	So it's a lot more entertaining as comparing to what everybody else is saying about the show.
10161764	10166425	Yeah, I saw that there was some, because you know, everything's got to have an internet petition these days.
10166445	10171726	And there's some internet petition going around to make it fairly represent cosplay.
10171766	10174247	And I was kind of like, well, then it wouldn't really be.
10174287	10175827	I mean, it's TV, right?
10176267	10182208	And funny enough, I don't know if you heard the interview with Matt, but we were joking at the end there about his time on the America's Worst Driver.
10182248	10184029	And it was TV.
10184289	10185029	It was a TV show.
10185849	10191494	The fact that you brought up there as a petition, I wanted to put my headset down and just start falling over with laughter.
10192575	10200502	How well you try to put a positive spin on cosplay, as soon as it hits TV, it's nothing but drama, drama, drama, drama, drama.
10200782	10203244	And people are complaining about how it's going to wreck the community.
10203304	10204625	No, we just brought everybody together.
10205146	10209690	You know what, if somebody did a reality show about Orange Lounge Radio, there'd be drama.
10209810	10211251	Oh my god, the shit-talking.
10212112	10212772	Right?
10212832	10218438	Because that's what TV does and that's what would happen even though, you know what, we all get along mostly.
10218958	10220660	No, for real.
10221000	10222622	We all get along great when it comes to time to do the show.
10222642	10224043	I wouldn't be able to run for president.
10224924	10226746	Do we have our disagreements behind the scenes?
10226866	10229028	Sure, once in a while, but they're disagreements among friends.
10229048	10229628	No, we don't.
10229768	10230629	If you don't, shut up.
10230649	10231850	What are you talking about?
10232051	10232891	You don't know shit.
10233592	10234393	I'm totally judging you.
10235353	10247119	No, in all seriousness, any argument we have behind the scenes, I think if any friendship goes forever with no disagreements, that's almost boring.
10249300	10255943	Also, on the same token, when you're arguing, it kind of brings the friendship stronger because you got points of view that you bring it to the table.
10256163	10256503	Yeah.
10257304	10260005	And then when you're tired of arguing, you look at Jamie like,
10260845	10262326	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10286759	10287280	Exactly.
10287460	10293084	And Rob, even though you said you're the only gay nerd in your town, I feel you.
10293224	10295826	I felt like I was the only black nerd in my town.
10295866	10298227	I'm like, I'm the only one that's renting anime.
10298668	10299288	Is it just me?
10301209	10302530	It's definitely not just you.
10302550	10303471	I know.
10303491	10305332	I figured that out about a couple of years later.
10305352	10306973	I'm like, I'm not the only one.
10311057	10312938	I feel better about myself now.
10331651	10332151	True that.
10333352	10333592	All right.
10333612	10334552	Well, take care, Ranma.
10334572	10335333	Thanks so much for the call.
10335353	10335813	It was a good one.
10336433	10337234	Hey, no problem.
10337354	10343556	And by the way, just because I have a GameStop Power-Up Rewards card, that doesn't mean you get to fully judge me.
10345097	10345557	Oh, snap.
10345757	10346157	All right.
10347378	10348378	No judgment happening here.
10348638	10351580	Ranchan, you know what I am totally not doing right now?
10352440	10354361	Not judging me, but I will say this.
10354381	10355541	No, I'm not not judging you.
10355641	10356702	I'm just not judging you.
10359253	10360714	Let me just say this and I'll get out of here.
10360734	10361934	Like I said, I'm Bobby Show.
10362674	10372678	When you guys find out that I actually paid for a membership for the Power Pro Rewards, y'all can come to my house, kick my ass, take all my consoles, and leave.
10372878	10375039	At that point, I no longer deserve to be a gamer.
10376400	10378561	I'll hold you to that because I want some new consoles.
10379982	10382204	Maybe that's why I called in to put it on public record.
10382284	10382964	Sounds good.
10383364	10383945	Take care, buddy.
10384045	10385826	Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here at VOG.
10385866	10386166	Listen.
10386926	10387467	Got that right.
10387607	10387827	All right.
10387847	10388227	Take care, buddy.
10388808	10390008	All right.
10390128	10390449	Bye.
10390469	10393550	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10393590	10395852	But we do have another call coming in, so let's get to it.
10395892	10396852	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10396872	10397193	Who's this?
10398253	10398814	Hey, what's up, guys?
10398834	10399474	This is Kai Judo.
10399714	10400335	Hey, Kai Judo.
10400355	10400955	What's on your mind, buddy?
10401940	10409877	and you know, you always say this is the show where every gamer has a voice and I just want to voice my opinion on this whole supposed console war do it
10410825	10417071	Yeah, me, okay, it can be said that I'm more on the side of PlayStation 4, like, I'll admit that, like, right away.
10417671	10422355	But it's not so much where it's, you know, for me, it's not really Sony versus Microsoft.
10422395	10424798	It's really their policies that really piss me off.
10424838	10427620	I feel that, you know, I've been gaming for a long time.
10427640	10429642	I mean, since the early 80s, I've been gaming.
10430343	10434006	And I just see a trend happening that I don't like in gaming, which...
10434907	10451394	you know I'm actually prevents me from playing a lot of games these days just for the simple fact that a lot of stuff is becoming I call it pay-as-you-play with all this microtransaction shit Microsoft is pushing that all this crap about you know where you know where you can lend your games and who you can lend it to the crappy
10452964	10457711	The freaking codes that they give you so that you can't sell your game at GameStop.
10457751	10458592	Not that I do that.
10458653	10460636	Usually I like to just buy games brand new anyway.
10460816	10461357	Online pass?
10461397	10462879	Is that what you're talking about?
10462899	10463460	Yeah, online pass.
10464001	10466445	I just hate the fact that it seems like...
10469063	10475028	If you're the type of person where you trade your games or you might not have internet access or whatever, it just seems like they're cutting those people out.
10475068	10478490	I'm like, there's still people out there that don't have all these luxuries.
10479371	10483594	For you to just cut those people out, it really just rubs me the wrong way.
10483634	10486537	I've been anti-Microsoft for the longest time now.
10486557	10492341	I haven't even checked into Xbox Live in I don't know how many days, I think, since this past summer.
10492401	10497085	I'm doing my own type of little boycott that you could call it again.
10497125	10498386	Not just Microsoft, but I mean...
10499292	10503917	A lot of the different game developers and companies that they do things that I don't necessarily agree with.
10504358	10505980	I mean, the list is huge.
10506000	10507621	There's so many things that's going on right now.
10519935	10523797	Most of them that enacted the online pass have since sunsetted it.
10523837	10525558	I think there's only a couple stragglers out there.
10526058	10531060	And to Microsoft's credit, they never enacted the online pass on their first party games.
10531520	10536943	Now, we would have all raked them over the coals if they had because they were already charging a fee for Xbox Live.
10536983	10538864	So that's neither here nor there.
10538984	10541645	But I guess my point I'm trying to make with this is...
10542265	10554532	When a company comes out and says, you know what, we were wrong, we made the wrong decision, which I think Microsoft kind of did since E3, is that not what you want?
10554752	10559334	Or what can the gaming companies do to win your fandom back?
10560975	10567219	Just, I mean, you know, just pretty much, I would say, as far as when it comes to...
10568607	10572210	lending your games out, trading your games.
10572650	10576033	Like I said, people like to go into GameStop and sell them, whatever.
10576053	10583139	As far as that type of stuff goes, don't try to put all these policies to get extra money out of people that do that.
10583339	10586261	Let people do what they've been doing for years.
10586722	10587622	Don't interfere with that.
10588083	10591846	Sell your game for $59.99 once the person buys it.
10592426	10594708	That should be your income right there.
10594748	10598171	You shouldn't charge people again to trade something in or
10598732	10600314	Whatever the other crap that you're doing out there.
10600614	10603157	Let me buy my shit and own my shit.
10603277	10605500	When I pay 60 bucks for your game, I own that game.
10606581	10606781	Right.
10606901	10609604	And especially with, like I said, with these microtransactions.
10609624	10614830	I mean, everybody's pretty much getting their hands dirty into something.
10614850	10615871	Like even Steam.
10616131	10619095	I would even go out to Steam and say that a few things that they're doing.
10620132	10621254	I don't necessarily agree with this.
10621494	10626139	I don't know if you guys are aware of this, but they have this new thing now where it's the early access.
10626439	10627180	Have you guys seen this?
10627420	10627941	Yes, I have.
10628041	10630864	In fact, I actually have a game with early access.
10631064	10632686	Yeah, I bought into that too.
10632706	10634989	I actually have two games that are early access.
10635329	10638493	They pretty much, from what I can see, they look like they're completed games.
10639173	10640415	But when you look at it, you're like...
10641704	10642724	What the hell is going on now?
10642744	10647006	We're actually paying now for incomplete games.
10647186	10648306	These are like alpha games.
10648326	10649947	They're not even in beta.
10650107	10651267	Hello, Minecraft.
10651707	10655589	You know what's interesting, though, about that, Kaijudo, is I think Kickstarter showed that there was a market for that.
10656542	10656942	Yeah, true.
10682637	10683798	I sort of said, you know what?
10683978	10687240	I think it really depends how much they're going to charge for a game.
10687580	10694525	And I still kind of stand by that because I would have been totally fine with Microsoft's new policies if they were only charging $20, $30 for the game.
10694885	10697867	Was that what was going to bring the price down from the $60 limit?
10697907	10699789	Which, let's be real, is still a little high.
10700389	10709475	One of the perks of Steam and one of the reasons why people use Steam, Steam sale and being able to buy games for literally a dollar.
10709975	10712237	I bought DLC Quest for a dollar.
10712918	10717405	And so it's kind of one of those, alright, so it's a digital copy and I'll never be able to sell it back.
10717525	10718527	It cost me a dollar.
10719228	10720651	And I'm like totally okay with that.
10721707	10728669	Yeah, I just finished getting all the DLC that I needed for Skyrim and also picking up Morrowind on Steam.
10728689	10730429	So, you know, I like Steam for that.
10730529	10738211	But I mean, like I said, it just looks like, to me, I just don't like the direction that things seem to be going.
10738491	10742772	And the reason why I'm so anti-Microsoft is just for the simple fact that
10743479	10759726	Inside me even though I'm pretty sure that um, you know, I'm a little man here and may never be affected But for me, it's like I feel okay Microsoft is kind of leading this charge if I could find some way to what to you know, not not really the not really to
10762014	10779168	Not really to make people go my way or see things my way, but if I could find some way to just pretty much let them know that we don't agree with this or whatever, maybe they'll start to change their policies like they did with the Xbox One, how they reverted everything back.
10779829	10790022	and I'm just hoping that if more people hop on that and more people get on Microsoft and all the other people that are doing these types of things then maybe we'll be able to get some balance.
10790423	10792666	I just want some balance in the gaming world.
10792686	10793507	It doesn't seem like it's that.
10793547	10795710	It just seems like pretty soon they're just going to
10796724	10811109	you know they're just gonna walk all over the little man and there isn't much that can be done unless unless us as gamers you know we stop with all this console war crap and we see things for what they are you know we tell them hey you know we don't like we don't like micro transactions or you know maybe you can fix it
10812249	10814091	Stuff like that.
10814131	10822660	Let me get this out before we let you go because I think this is important to say because you know there's going to be people sitting at home or in the office listening to this podcast right now that is thinking this guy is crazy.
10822800	10823981	This guy needs to let it go.
10824321	10826283	This guy has too much hatred.
10827445	10829226	You know there's people sitting there thinking that right now, right?
10829306	10830488	Oh yeah, of course.
10830568	10831789	I come across it all the time.
10831949	10836573	Sure, but I think there's a good comment in the chat room that kind of plays into both sides of this here.
10836613	10837534	And I think this is important.
10837554	10844540	This is from Chris109 in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying, Yeah, but the damage has been done and it takes time for the wound to heal.
10845201	10856791	And I think in a way, whether you personally listening to the show think Kaijudo is overreacting or not, I can certainly think, you know, I've gone to a place and I've got bad service or a company did something to really irritate me.
10856931	10859333	And it was a while before I tried that company again.
10859753	10860293	You know what I mean?
10860633	10868675	But I did go back at some point and either I learned why I stopped doing it in the first place or I was like, all right, things are better.
10868775	10869515	Things have changed.
10869555	10870795	You know, I'm happier now.
10871115	10885538	Do you think, Kaijudo, that maybe that's what's going to happen is that if Microsoft is a little more transparent in some of these policies and kind of gets that community that they've lost, that tapped into the community, if they can get some of that back, that maybe we can heal these wounds?
10886679	10888859	Well, you know, me personally,
10891242	10893684	Don't get me wrong, I've already made my decision.
10893824	10896186	My boycott is going to stick.
10896246	10900109	I have to do what I have to do for myself, basically.
10900309	10910037	For me, I don't want to live in that type of gaming world, so the games that I choose to purchase, the companies that I choose to invest in, they don't do any of that right now.
10910057	10911738	That's what I'm doing for myself.
10912339	10918204	Like I said, I'm not out here to try and make people see things my way, but I just want people to be aware
10918874	10923177	that, you know, the gaming world as it is now is pretty screwed up.
10923677	10926079	And I'm just saying that people need to be aware of that.
10926659	10927960	Stop with the console world stuff.
10928120	10932463	It's not about Xbox versus PlayStation 3 for some of us out there.
10932483	10936686	For some of us, it's more about, hey, you know, don't cut the little man out.
10937307	10941590	You know, remember what gaming was about originally.
10941950	10943751	You know, it was originally about fun.
10943791	10945993	I mean, of course, you have companies who, you know, they got to make money.
10946473	10947954	You know, everybody says it all the time, but I mean...
10948723	10952026	It was always fun, you know, trading with your friends and all this stuff.
10952066	10957290	And now it's just becoming way, way too political and way too, like, out of hand with all this crap.
10958010	10958691	So that's what I'm saying.
10958811	10959051	All right.
10959071	10960893	Well, I think you make a good point at the end of the day.
10960993	10965056	It's just, you know what, play the games because there's a lot of good stuff out there right now.
10965316	10969359	So, Kaijudo, thank you for the call and for the perspective that could be challenging for some.
10969399	10969920	I appreciate it.
10970861	10971081	All right.
10971141	10971321	All right.
10971361	10971761	Take care, buddy.
10973002	10977203	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10977303	10977803	Interesting.
10977943	10986005	I just, you know, I have to admit, I'm kind of like, I don't, I mean, for me, it's like when Microsoft releases that game, I'm going to have to play.
10986285	10988225	I have to kind of let that past go.
10988605	10993906	But I can understand, too, the whole like, you know, when I really feel like I've been pissed off.
10994026	10996547	I'm not about to throw 500 bucks at a company anytime soon.
10996607	10998227	It's very, very tricky.
10998387	10998747	Very tricky.
10998767	11002368	Better be pissed off without the system or buy it and get pissed on.
11003169	11003489	Who knows?
11003549	11005451	All right, let's see if we get any other calls.
11005972	11008374	I'll keep the lines open for a little bit here while we do some Twitter topics.
11008394	11012178	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11012278	11016803	Actdeft says in the chat room, Kaijudo may hate Microsoft, but at least he's not being a dick about it.
11017324	11018144	He was very professional.
11018245	11018905	Very reasonable.
11018945	11021027	He said, this is why, this is my point.
11021568	11023710	Whether you think I'm crazy or not, this is how it is.
11025051	11027772	Thought that was a very well-composed call.
11028772	11029712	Let's see, going to Twitter.
11032053	11032873	Oops, sorry.
11033953	11036613	A more professional host would have had Twitter open already, but I didn't.
11037794	11040034	Let's see if I can get to some of the app messages here.
11040094	11040774	All right, here we go.
11041755	11043795	SSJ100Matt tweets us at twitter.com.
11044695	11048896	The community at Overclocked Remixed released a Sonic CD remix album.
11049456	11054741	I love that he slipped that in there.
11054841	11055322	And better.
11056183	11058645	Speaking of gaming wars that will never end, there you go.
11058725	11059466	That's a classic one.
11059686	11060227	But check that out.
11060307	11063029	SonicCD.ocremix.org You know what?
11063249	11067133	No matter which one you prefer, it sounds like there'll be a remix album for you.
11067533	11068334	And let's go have drinks.
11069855	11077601	Spazinator wants to know, we talk Steam sale here at OLR, is it quote, yay Steam sale, or quote, goddammit a Steam sale?
11078741	11079742	It's a little bit of both.
11079762	11081663	A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B.
11090729	11119450	I think that's what it is for me it's like yay maybe this game I've really wanted to play but I just I wasn't really convinced until it drops in price like I get excited for that but then like where I get pissed off is that oh I bought that and five other games that I wasn't expecting to buy there's something that's actually kind of a kick in the nuts with Steam and that's you put stuff on the wish list and if it's generally on sale they email you but I don't think I've seen any emails from my wish list stuff for these for the autumn sales or winter sales what the hell am I saying
11123253	11124133	The sale for no reason.
11124153	11124774	Oh, it is autumn sale.
11124914	11126415	Yeah, it's autumn sale.
11127135	11128116	There'll be a winter sale later.
11128236	11131979	That's for Christmas-y time.
11132019	11134520	1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11135061	11140064	While I get a few more tweets in here, Marcus Boy saying, I have a feeling tonight's OLR is going to be awesome.
11141085	11142586	Well, it was because you plugged it.
11142866	11143647	So I appreciate it.
11144147	11144988	It was a good show tonight.
11145008	11145628	We're having fun.
11145808	11146529	You having fun, Jason?
11146649	11147029	Absolutely.
11147089	11148090	Worth the drive from San Francisco?
11148110	11148230	Always.
11150191	11154635	Next time we have an interviewee in San Francisco, I'm going to have you chauffeur him up here.
11154735	11160960	I can do that, or I can provide better quality to the individual with my microphone set up and everything else.
11161080	11162301	All right, we'll figure it out.
11162361	11164343	Flexibility is wonderful.
11164383	11168527	You're going to be our man on the street running up and down the Bay Area where all our guests usually are.
11168547	11170048	Just don't put me in Oakland and I'll be happy.
11171328	11172629	We'll have extra for Handle Oakland.
11172649	11176830	That's where he lives.
11178111	11178631	He can handle it.
11180212	11183453	1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11184873	11186154	What the hell is this tweet?
11186194	11193476	I've got to read this tweet because the tweet goes to some health company and it says, I was a patient at OLR.
11194176	11196637	I had the best care when I had my appendectomy.
11196737	11197138	Thank you.
11197198	11197938	Happy holidays.
11200284	11206946	Thank God this poor woman wasn't in the presence of Loki playing Surgeon Simulator or her appendectomy may not have gone so well.
11207066	11207566	Right, Loki?
11208707	11210227	How the hell did we get that tweet?
11210367	11210767	Spam.
11210807	11214228	I guess probably OLR is some other surgery company or something.
11214528	11215489	Laparoscopic.
11217449	11218009	Removing appendix.
11218029	11220070	No, I'm thinking of the OLR.
11220610	11223711	Laparoscopic is when they... No, no, that means the L was for laparoscopic.
11224721	11226303	Oh, maybe the OLR.
11226523	11227063	Yeah, who knows?
11227363	11227684	Who knows?
11227724	11228124	Something?
11228604	11229585	I fucking don't know.
11229705	11233028	If it was spam, then I just gave a plug to something here on air.
11233108	11234188	Spam, spam, spam, spam.
11234248	11243315	I just went to that account and their second most recent, retweet in this case, but their second most recent post is retweeting a spaceship blunt.
11245357	11245537	Wow.
11245557	11245617	Wow.
11246900	11250102	and they retweet a lot of picture stuff.
11250402	11250762	Love it.
11251563	11252543	Love it, love it, love it.
11253744	11254824	Let's see some other tweets.
11254864	11259167	Flaco Jones reminding us that the Bioshock triple pack is only $15 at Amazon.
11260147	11261348	Damn you, Flaco Jones.
11262128	11262568	Damn you.
11262649	11263129	Got it.
11263809	11264570	A long time ago.
11265450	11265930	I guess that's it.
11266110	11267371	Oh, one more call.
11267551	11271913	One call coming in at the fucking buzzer when I was about to close it down.
11271974	11272374	But here we go.
11272434	11272814	One more call.
11273114	11274015	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
11274035	11274335	Who's this?
11275250	11276791	Hey, this is Rageinator.
11276851	11278032	Hey, Rage, we see you.
11278473	11278813	Hi.
11278873	11279253	We see you.
11279293	11280034	How you doing, Rageinator?
11280254	11283097	You need to turn down your computer, unless that's the only way you hear us.
11283257	11283877	Just a little bit.
11283977	11284458	What's up, buddy?
11286319	11292765	Well, I wanted to give, or make a somewhat serious call this week.
11293005	11294586	You don't make serious calls.
11295847	11298990	Well, now, all I have
11300437	11319886	Truth be told, I always have heard the topic as I was dealing with my cat at the time, but I believe the three of you, or, well, four of you were talking about someone, again, linking mental illness in video games to violence.
11320646	11324268	And, you know, and now,
11327270	11332053	I'm going to open up here a little bit and talk about something that I generally don't talk about.
11333653	11336095	I'm mentally ill myself.
11339596	11354204	Back in 1998, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, which is also known as PTSD, also known as shell shock.
11357347	11374830	and as a result between those two diagnoses I generally have a hard time wriggling emotions and sometimes my behavior as a result can be a little bit off.
11375470	11384872	It can be construed as odd or unusual to someone that may not have to deal with mental illness.
11386547	11404211	That being said, just because someone's mentally ill, regardless of whether they play video games or not, that does not mean they're going to go Norman Bates on someone's ass or go Texas Chainsaw Massacre on someone.
11404571	11405632	No one said what they did.
11406532	11411153	Well, I don't think we did, but I think the media sometimes gives that protection.
11411653	11415014	Well, I'm just saying that's what the general public
11416269	11428175	You know, that's what the general perception is in society is that if someone has mental illness, that's... That's what we talk about when we talk about the stigma of mental health.
11428495	11429256	That's what's out there.
11429276	11431417	And thank you for opening up about that, Raginator.
11431477	11433218	That's brave of you to say on the show.
11433598	11434479	And I'm going to say this.
11434659	11438661	The reality is there's a lot of people like you out there.
11438821	11439901	And it's funny.
11440042	11443984	Even though I'm talking about earlier in the show, I feel like the only gay nerd...
11444864	11446985	I bet you're not the only nerd.
11447305	11450445	Pardon me, but you must be a bit of a nerd if you listen to the show.
11450485	11456847	You're probably by far not the only nerd that suffers from the types of conditions that you're talking about that you just brought up.
11458727	11465109	I think mental illness is much more common than sometimes the media and the mass perception often gives it credit for.
11465569	11468870	But there's also so many variant varieties.
11469531	11475013	And for example, some people who have certain disorders don't consider it to be a mental illness.
11475053	11477914	For example, yeah, I may be autistic.
11477974	11479235	I don't consider myself mentally ill.
11480615	11488859	You know, if I had... Well, in a way, and just to kind of, you know, because like people get sick, not mental illness, but physical illness.
11489499	11493521	Is a person with diabetes necessarily consider themselves sick?
11494953	11496654	I mean, they're managing, you know what I mean?
11496674	11498994	And that's kind of what happened, right?
11499434	11506876	There's a difference because, well, I mean, the better comparison... And I'm not belittling diabetes by any means.
11506896	11508537	My grandma had it and suffered from it and so forth.
11508557	11517519	But I'm just saying, you start to kind of, you know, treat it and it doesn't... You conduct your day-to-day life managing it.
11517619	11519000	The difference would be in...
11520740	11521100	Outro Music
11536025	11560319	um that being said I think what they're not also considering is that some of these people who have gone back um were uh had much more severe forms of socio uh disorders had there wasn't one of them actually diagnosed schizophrenic which means they hallucinate schizophrenic is not multiple personality disorder there are two different things
11560899	11565204	Some people have complete reactions based on trauma.
11566004	11580119	I know people with PTSD, and I'm talking about the post-war variety, who a car backfires and they're running for cover.
11580500	11582081	That's the type of person I would not want with a gun.
11582842	11583342	for example.
11583862	11590904	That's somebody who I wouldn't want to have access to weapons because I've seen that instant look for panic, look for defense.
11591904	11593065	Sometimes there is that.
11593465	11608869	But the average person dealing with depression or dealing with... I just want to be careful with the broad generalizations because you also would not be the one to say who shouldn't... A professional does this, not you.
11608909	11609969	But my point was...
11610489	11612550	Real quick, Regineer, sorry, I'll let her finish and Regineer will get back to you.
11612831	11629900	My point on that was saying that if a person is going to have a tendency to go into a defensive mode or to go into some sort of memory regression, you want to watch, but you don't know who everybody is.
11630300	11631941	That's why there has to be better screening.
11633123	11634183	That was my point, sorry.
11634404	11634944	No, no worries.
11635004	11637065	Ragenator, go ahead and get your thought out and then I have a question for you.
11637825	11657514	Also, one thing to consider is that regardless of what diagnosis that someone has, be it PTSD or schizophrenia or this, that, or the other, some questions that should be asked is, are they in some form of treatment?
11657714	11658034	Are they
11658547	11683190	seeking one-on-one counseling, are they seeing psychiatrists getting medications, are they taking their medications as prescribed, you know, and they're usually taking this pill or this pill at the right, you know, levels, you know, dosages every day consistently at the right time, so on and so forth, and I mean, you know,
11683900	11700610	If they're not seeking treatments, not taking their medications as prescribed, if they're abusing street drugs or alcohol, then yeah, their behavior is going to get far, far worse.
11700931	11712718	Plus, if you also, one thing to consider is, on top of that, more often than not, the mentally ill
11714160	11718401	is the victim of crimes relative to the perpetrator.
11722642	11741367	If, let's say, hypothetically speaking, I don't know Sacramento at all, so I don't know what areas of town, or the good sides of town, where the homeless tend to be, so on and so forth, but if you can think of what area that
11742708	11768557	the homeless and the mentally ill tend to congregate and you happen to be on the street after no good chances are you're going to probably if you want an easy mark you're going to probably go after the people that won't put up much of a fight which probably will be the mentally ill you know so once they're very well you'll hear about
11769150	11775336	The guy with schizophrenia that pushed some woman off of a training platform and that woman gets killed.
11775436	11779380	But they're the exception to the rule, not the rule itself.
11780881	11792553	And chances are, they're that person that didn't take their medication or was doing alcohol or drugs a few hours earlier.
11793573	11795595	or multiple whatever, so.
11815715	11820038	How do you think, Ragenator, maybe you don't have an answer for this, but I want to try and ask it anyway.
11820558	11823461	Ragenator, how do you think video games help you?
11825302	11844135	Well, in the times that I'm stressed out or depressed, let's say I'm feeling a severe depression symptoms or there's some kind of stimulus outside that's really agitating me,
11844941	11845681	one way or another.
11848822	11859105	I use video games as my primary coping mechanism to deal with the symptoms.
11861446	11869969	At least prior to my PS3 being stolen, I would either play Flower or Super Stardust HD.
11872037	11874618	Now, obviously, Flower is a very relaxing game.
11876398	11894343	But, regardless of the game, I'll focus in on that game for a while, and for all intents and purposes, while I'm playing that game, the rest of the world and my own thoughts don't exist.
11895004	11900185	I'm just focusing on completing the level, beating the level, beating the AI, doing whatever.
11901449	11907910	and after a while, things go back to normal and I use air quotes.
11909371	11911591	Well, normal for me, you know.
11911611	11912471	Sure, sure.
11913671	11928174	And, you know, once in a great while that doesn't work 100% of the time, once in a great while it's so bad that I do need to be hospitalized, case in point, February 3rd,
11928764	11929785	I'm sorry to hear that.
11950447	11955573	Well, thank you for sharing some very deeply personal stuff with us.
11956193	11956714	Sure, no problem.
11972751	11973652	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11994046	11999028	Walk a mile in somebody else's shoes because at least at the end of the day, if nothing else, you have their shoes.
11999608	12001409	You have their shoes and you're a mile away.
12001749	12002009	All right.
12002730	12007452	But that was, you know, thank you for giving some incentive for education as well.
12007652	12008172	Appreciate it.
12008192	12008512	Sure, no problem.
12009012	12009793	All right, Ragenator.
12010013	12012134	I got to end it up and end up the show.
12012674	12012994	Thank you.
12013074	12013634	But thank you, buddy.
12013834	12014274	Have a good one.
12014415	12015015	Sure, no problem.
12015135	12015795	Have a nice night.
12015995	12016455	All right, you too.
12017256	12019717	Props to Ragenator, says ActF in our chat room.
12019737	12020157	There we go.
12020857	12021217	All right.
12022538	12022738	Whew.
12024113	12025614	And to think, I almost didn't take that call.
12026395	12028417	Because we were on our way out of here.
12028517	12029818	But now we are definitely on our way out of here.
12029838	12031600	Your fingers were hovering over the Alt-F4 just by time.
12031620	12032941	I know, I was like, am I going to take it?
12032981	12033462	Am I going to take it?
12033482	12034483	All right, we're going to take it.
12034923	12037105	And it was a really, really insightful call.
12037606	12038727	Heavy stuff on tonight's show.
12038767	12041590	My God, we covered a lot of good stuff tonight.
12041690	12042831	This was a damn good show.
12042911	12044432	This was one for the Emmys.
12044793	12048216	I don't know if they give Emmys to podcasts, but if they did, I'd be submitting this one.
12048716	12050797	I have one last fun, silly thing.
12050957	12051998	Okay, good, good, please.
12052058	12054899	Has anybody ever actually made it to the bottom of the Steam sale page?
12055099	12055319	Yeah.
12055659	12057040	And you've seen the fact that it's upside down?
12057160	12057420	Yeah.
12057440	12058881	You notice the fact that it says spring?
12059241	12059861	Yeah, yeah, no, I did.
12059901	12060482	Instead of autumn.
12060962	12065384	And if you actually use that navigation, your experience will be temporarily upside down as well.
12065784	12066884	On some pages, not all.
12067325	12074148	You go all the way to the bottom, you hit featured items, you get the featured item pages where autumn is on bottom and everything is upside down.
12074188	12076549	You scroll to the top, spring sale is oriented right side up.
12076869	12078450	Incredibly silly, but hilarious.
12079490	12081912	And I figure most people just scroll down until they see a game.
12082472	12087395	As soon as the game stops being listed by... Click the button, didn't get a Steam card, didn't care.
12088395	12088775	Exactly.
12089056	12089336	All right.
12090076	12094258	Well, and then for Australia, since they're all upside down and it's spring there, that's...
12095379	12095819	It's a joke.
12095899	12096960	It's a joke, people.
12097220	12108787	Our chat system at work, we have a plug-in for it, so anybody that's even visiting, anybody that's located as in the southern hemisphere, we rotate their avatars upside down.
12108867	12109488	That's amazing.
12109508	12110268	I love it.
12110528	12111489	It's called the Aussies plug-in.
12111889	12112229	All right.
12113290	12116192	Jason, since you do have the mic, I want to thank you for being here on the show yet again.
12116332	12116713	Always.
12116913	12121036	I know you're going to be a familiar face while you're in town over the next month, but it's great to have you here.
12121676	12126820	And I guess I'll ask you if you have any final thoughts before we see you next week.
12129422	12133345	I'll be continuing to say this because we're not even here yet, but have a mighty fine holiday season.
12133965	12137508	Well, it already started, if you think about it, with the Thanksgiving already.
12137528	12137968	So there you go.
12138340	12144903	and schools are going to start letting out real fast here and new systems and all the fancy, exciting hullabaloo.
12146544	12147525	Loki, your final thought tonight.
12148665	12153588	So they're giving away some codes for Ms.
12153648	12157450	Explosion Man and the Maw and Aqua and stuff at McDonald's.
12158310	12158590	Really?
12159111	12161872	It's part of a promotion with Xbox One and stuff.
12161932	12163253	Chicken McNuggets all week long.
12163533	12164813	This is why you're bad.
12166014	12167455	It's like when Taco Bell was giving away the PS4s.
12168568	12170591	I did like... Oh, never mind.
12171832	12173494	I have a couple final thoughts here real quick.
12174295	12181783	One, it looks like some of you chatters are having a spirited debate right now, so don't forget, like Ranma and I were talking about earlier, go have a drink at the end of the day.
12182484	12182985	I know you will.
12183765	12202713	and then my other final thought is I neglected to plug this earlier in the show because I was trying to speed along with everything else but I do want to mention it's kind of an additional housekeeping thing and I'll remind you guys at the top of the show next week there is a new raffle at vognetwork.com and if you would like to enter to win a $20 gift card
12204113	12210134	for your choice, either Xbox Live, Nintendo Network, Steam, PlayStation Network, or iTunes.
12210194	12210955	I think those are the five.
12210975	12211755	You get to win your choice.
12212315	12214736	Check out all the details, vognetwork.com slash raffle.
12214796	12215976	All you have to do, participate.
12216036	12219037	And by listening to OLR, you've participated and have a chance to win.
12219397	12224178	So check that all out, and congratulations to Fifth Dream, who won the very first VOG Network raffle.
12224258	12227559	We gave away cards against humanity, and he got it.
12228099	12228799	So, good job.
12229219	12231359	Just the single game or the big box?
12231499	12233740	Not the big, but the starter set thing
12233800	12234621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
12251906	12253766	You're gonna be just like Gina Davis.
12254707	12257387	She was that actress from Thelma and Louise who ended up taking a bar tree.
12258447	12260308	Okay.
12260588	12262568	I have a hunting bow that I'd like to learn how to shoot.
12262848	12264969	You'll be like Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games.
12265429	12267829	That movie was so fucking long.
12267989	12271070	It was just like so long.
12271130	12273851	I'm shocked that that wasn't the first thing you said.
12273891	12274291	I know, right?
12274591	12275511	I need to borrow your books.
12276524	12281882	they're on a Kindle unfortunately but maybe if you ask Alan really nicely about your eyelashes he'll let you borrow it for a week so you can read them
12283630	12286131	I just will put it on my table then.
12286171	12287171	I like physical books.
12288112	12289393	Fair enough.
12290033	12296556	Also, because I always like to say this is the end of the show, I really want to thank you guys for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and participating with the show this week.
12296596	12304561	Whether you were here live at vognetword.com or you listened on the podcast feed or Stitcher or YouTube or whatever, we just want to thank you for sticking with it all the way to the end of the show.
12304901	12308363	There were some tough topics tonight and a lot of variety of stuff and here you are.
12308403	12309523	You made it all the way through the show.
12309563	12310784	We really appreciate your support.
12311718	12317570	I loved the chat room by the way because I love intelligent debate and oh my god they were giving it to me and I never get that from my mother.
12319914	12321475	You look like you're about ready to smoke a cigarette.
12321615	12322316	That was a good debate.
12323457	12324377	Not that I'm endorsing smoking.
12324777	12329320	For the record, I find mental stimulation a lot more encouraging.
12329541	12333303	A lot more of a turn-on than... Well, alrighty then.
12333343	12334083	You know what I mean.
12334964	12337446	I find it to be a lot more satisfying than other things.
12337646	12344270	If you found yourself stimulated by tonight's Orange Lounge Radio, then we want to invite you guys to please spread the word about the show.
12345931	12347072	What are you laughing about over there?
12347652	12359357	That was, not to waste the segue, but the tonal aspect of doing that, carrying it over from what was going on to your normal outro was phenomenal.
12359417	12359817	Literally.
12359877	12361438	It was very good, and then I broke it.
12361458	12362318	I pat myself on the back.
12362378	12363259	Thank you very much, sir.
12364119	12365500	Alright, okay.
12365580	12365901	That's it.
12365921	12366581	We're on out of here.
12367182	12369664	If you like the show, please tell a friend or five about the show.
12369724	12370545	Help us spread the word.
12370685	12372887	Nice reviews on iTunes, Stitcher Radio.
12373127	12374908	They go a very long way and we really appreciate it.
12375209	12378932	Happy whatever you want-ica over the next few weeks.
12378952	12380193	The thing to say is hug Semiak.
12381074	12381334	Okay.
12381834	12382015	Yeah.
12382215	12382475	Alright.
12383216	12384317	Happy Hanukkah.
12384437	12385758	Whatever it is you want to celebrate.
12385838	12386398	Have a good one.
12386418	12387139	Fifth night tonight.
12387659	12388700	And that's it.
12388720	12389541	We'll see you next week.
12391223	12391543	Bye.
12392950	12393851	Thank you for watching.
12422342	12423663	See you next week.
