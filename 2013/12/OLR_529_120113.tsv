7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	We're officially on the road to the holiday season and the lovable 3rd Street Saints are joining in the festivities with new DLC.
19000	24000	Also tonight, GamerX founder Matt Kahn joins us to talk about his Kickstarter for a Snatcher inspired adventure game.
24000	28000	Your questions, comments, calls on the show where every video gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	38000	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	39000	I just said that.
39000	46000	I know you did and I'm saying it again. Live on this December 1st, 2013, episode number 529.
46000	55000	Welcome to the show. We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gamer lulls, and who knows what else with my co-hosts, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
55000	58000	Does that mean he said it dead and now he's undead?
58000	61000	He said it out of turn is what he said. Fired!
61000	62000	It's fine. Alright.
62000	63000	Blah.
63000	65000	DarkSakura, we missed you last week. Welcome back.
65000	69000	I wish I was here last week because it was fucking loud.
69000	70000	Yeah.
70000	73000	We went to this place called the Yard House which we were discussing before.
73000	77000	Not like super fancy pants but a little fancy.
77000	80000	I ate something incredibly non-kosher and it was delicious.
80000	83000	It was a surf and turf burger without the bun.
83000	84000	Well then happy Hanukkah, Jamie.
84000	86000	Happy Hanukkah to me!
86000	89000	It is the fifth night. I will be lighting my candles when I return home.
89000	92000	How did Hanukkah's giving, Hanukkah's giving or whatever?
92000	93000	Thanksgivica.
93000	94000	Thanksgivica, yeah. So how did Thanksgivica treat you?
94000	96000	It was fucking loud too.
96000	104000	Okay, well we went to have Thanksgiving dinner at, you remember Dan's buddy Adam, right?
104000	111000	We went over there and there were the kids and Dan's cousins and brought the kids too and there was a bunch of little people and fucking sports ball.
111000	112000	I hate sports ball.
112000	113000	I hate sports ball.
113000	114000	Unless it's DVR.
114000	121000	And I say it with extra, extra southern accent because all I heard about yesterday was Alabama Auburn, no one cur.
121000	123000	But you do love Tecmo Bowl, right?
123000	124000	Yeah, I guess.
124000	127000	I thought there was some, there's some sports ball you can tolerate, I know that.
127000	128000	Yeah, some.
128000	130000	I used to date a rugby player and that was pretty awesome.
130000	135000	Alright, also say hello as well to, Loki is here in studio.
135000	136000	Hi.
136000	137000	How you doing Techmaster Loki?
137000	138000	Doing fine.
138000	139000	Yeah?
139000	142000	I'm trying to figure out where these phantom stain spots came from.
142000	144000	It looks like something dripped on my hand.
144000	145000	Pizza sauce.
145000	147000	It's not pizza sauce.
147000	148000	It's grease.
148000	151000	Well it must be for the breadsticks but they're not that greasy.
151000	153000	I mean they are greasy but they're not that greasy.
153000	155000	Like I didn't notice any grease dripping off of them.
155000	162000	So one of Loki's, you know Loki always brings an interesting dining selection to the show and you know it's sometimes fast.
162000	167000	It's become a bit of a betting game amongst the live OLR listeners what he brings to the show.
167000	173000	So tonight he brought his, he goes to the pizza place, he doesn't get pizza he gets just a mass of breadsticks.
173000	175000	They are really good breadsticks so I will say.
175000	178000	If you have round table pizza in your area and you've had the breadsticks they are really good.
178000	179000	I'm not gonna lie.
179000	181000	But yeah it's probably oil or something.
181000	182000	Yeah.
182000	183000	Anyway.
183000	184000	It's cheese.
184000	185000	Cheese or something.
185000	186000	It's cheesy.
186000	188000	It keeps Loki cheesy y'all.
188000	189000	Alright.
189000	190000	It's not easy.
190000	191000	It's being cheesy.
192000	195000	I know you heard him a minute ago and he is back this week.
195000	197000	Say hello to the voice of the show.
197000	198000	Jason.
198000	199000	It's me.
199000	200000	Again.
200000	201000	Yet again.
201000	202000	Yeah how you doing Jason?
202000	203000	Doing good.
203000	204000	Yeah?
204000	205000	Been a good couple of days.
205000	206000	Been a good four day weekend.
206000	207000	Did you have a good Thanksgiving as well?
207000	208000	I did Friendsgiving.
208000	211000	Co-workers of mine invited me over and there was about 20 of us.
211000	215000	Anybody that follows me on Twitter may have seen this story that I started to come up with.
215000	220000	A Twitter, Apple, Google, and GitHub employee sat around the table and I don't really have
220000	223000	a joke to fill in to the end of that but I'm sure there's one in there somewhere.
223000	225000	Some Silicon Valley wag.
225000	227000	Friendsgiving is a lot of fun.
227000	228000	Friendsgiving is very good.
228000	229000	Yeah it was a good time.
229000	232000	I had kind of a late Friends- well not- you know what I did last night?
232000	234000	I went and saw a grandpa from Hoard House.
234000	237000	If you know my other show Hoard House that I do about all things sound like gaming but
237000	238000	never too seriously Wednesdays.
238000	243000	I went and hung out with grandpa last night in what I think is becoming a bit of a post-Thanksgiving
243000	247000	tradition for us where we go, we visit, and then we go out and drink.
247000	248000	So I'm-
248000	249000	I heard you.
249000	250000	Got super drunk.
250000	253560	I'm a little- well you must read my Twitter because I wrote some really stupid stuff last
253560	254560	night while I-
254560	255560	No, no, no, no.
255560	256560	Grandpa posted it on Facebook.
256560	260000	Okay, well you know me and my alcohol tolerance of which I have none, right?
260000	261000	Because I usually don't drink.
261000	265700	I'm usually the sober one but visiting grandpa in the city we were able to take cabs and
265700	267200	all that stuff.
267200	271500	I had seven drinks last night.
271500	273220	And yeah, it was a lot of fun.
273220	274220	I'm good.
274220	275220	I'm good.
275220	279000	But I am feeling a little bit like if I'm dragging a little bit today, I blame that.
279000	281500	I blame Friendsgiving with drinks.
281500	282500	Good times.
282500	283500	All right.
283500	285500	Is that the new Zynga game?
285500	286500	Friendsgiving with drinks?
286500	287500	Possibly.
287500	288500	Possibly.
288500	289500	All right.
289500	290500	We have a busy show tonight.
290500	291820	We have a lot of news to get into as well.
291820	297140	Also joining us a little later on in the show in about 20 minutes, the founder of a convention
297140	302180	I talked a lot about here on Orange Launch Radio because I went and I helped out with
302180	304420	a panel there, GamerX.
304420	308140	Matt Kahn is the founder of GamerX and he is actually going to be on the show tonight
308140	313260	in about 20 minutes to talk about a new Kickstarter that actually has nothing to do with conventions
313260	318700	but it is kind of neat because it's inspired by an old, you know, we love old classic video
318700	320300	games here at OLR.
320300	323940	How many, show of hands, who remembers the old video game Snatcher?
323940	324940	Yep.
324940	326500	Almost every hand in the room went up.
326500	328060	Who has Snatcher?
328060	336860	Well, Matt's latest Kickstarter for his company MidBoss Games is a game that's about a futuristic
336860	339780	San Francisco that is heavily inspired by Snatcher.
339780	342940	So he's going to come on, talk a little bit about that and of course, if he's going to
342940	344980	be, I have to ask him about GamerX.
344980	346620	I want to know about GamerX too.
346620	348500	So we got to ask some of those questions.
348500	353760	So we will get to those questions and your questions live in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
353760	356060	in about 20 minutes or so.
356060	359580	But first, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that, but I do want to get to a kickoff
359580	361620	topic as well.
361620	363940	This one's a little bit more of a serious note.
363940	368200	This is housekeeping of sorts, IDK, what you want to call it, but we got to talk a little
368200	371700	bit about last week.
371700	373060	I thought we had a great show last week.
373060	374660	We had a lot of fun here on the show last week.
374660	375660	Even though you weren't here.
375660	376660	I wasn't here.
376660	377660	How could it be awesome?
377660	378660	Well, it wasn't our best ever.
378660	379660	I'll be honest.
379660	380660	Dark Soccer.
380660	381660	It could have been our best.
381660	382820	You need me to balance it out, huh?
382820	383820	But we did know.
383820	390020	We did get feedback from multiple sources on last week's show that maybe felt that some
390020	393340	of the discussion we had last week might have been a little bit off.
393340	396420	And so it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
396420	399900	So I want to entertain some of this feedback and I want to kind of respond to it a little
399900	403380	bit respectfully.
403380	406700	I'm going to call this one out because it was publicly posted to our Facebook.
406700	408860	And by calling out, I just mean I'm selecting it to read it on there.
408860	411740	Not like, I'm calling you out, black racks, three o'clock.
411740	412740	No.
412740	413740	Because I do appreciate the feedback.
413740	414740	It's a show where every gamer has a voice.
414740	416500	So I want to read this post that came to our Facebook.
416500	418880	It's from Carla O is the name on Facebook.
418880	423620	And it says, I think I might stop listening to the show if it becomes PlayStation centric,
423620	425940	which it's starting to seem that way.
425940	427420	And that was the comment.
427420	432940	I was really trying to think like, what in last week's show might have given the impression
432940	434220	that we were PlayStation centric?
434220	437560	And I was really thinking about it and I was like, you know what?
437560	443660	In gaming culture as of late anyway, things have definitely seemed to be tilting in PlayStation
443660	444660	's favor as a whole.
444660	448820	And I'm like, I'm looking at the big picture here and I'm trying to think, why is that?
448820	454540	Well, that's because Microsoft has been playing a little bit of a game of catch up PR, fixed
454540	457860	mistakes ever since E3, right?
457860	460140	And obviously they launched the Xbox one.
460140	462100	We kicked off last week's show.
462100	464980	Loki had some choice words for the Xbox one.
464980	468100	I felt what Loki was saying and even kind of listening back to it.
468100	472120	I didn't think it was anything that I haven't like seen in other internet places.
472120	477640	I think their voices I'm hearing other places, you know, again, every gamer has a voice.
477640	479480	These are what some gamer voices are saying.
479480	482720	Not everything out there is positive, but I was trying to think, does that, was that
482720	484480	really making us PlayStation centric?
484480	485480	I'm not sure.
485480	486480	So I did respond.
486480	487800	Nobody am on Sony's payroll now.
487800	488800	Stop.
488800	489800	No, you're not.
489800	490800	All right.
490800	493440	But I did respond and I gave an answer basically similar to what I'm telling you guys now.
493440	495420	We try to treat everything fairly.
495420	498560	And one thing I did point out, as I said, I know you probably haven't been listening
498560	501600	to this show, but if you go back to like 2006.
501600	504320	And this is definitely a way I kind of feel in general.
504320	508280	If we go back to 2006, the roles were almost reversed.
508280	513600	I mean, coming out of E3 that year, Sony was the laughing stock of the entire gaming industry.
513600	519760	Giant enemy crabs, 599 US dollars, 599, like we all remember that, right?
519760	523440	And I know I've made this comparison on the show before is that we're almost sitting in
523440	527580	a place now where we're looking at like the complete flip of that.
527580	531480	Microsoft had one of those E3s this year that they've been trying to recover from and
531480	532720	PlayStation.
532720	536920	You know, we had something very interesting happen at E3 this year.
536920	538320	Let's think back, you guys.
538320	543080	This is something we have not seen in a long time in this industry, ever since the ads
543080	546120	in the magazines that say Sega does what Nintendo don't.
546120	551120	We did not see something of the caliber of Jack Trenton getting up on stage and saying,
551120	556960	we believe that gamers should be able to, sorry, I forget his direct quote, but we believe
556960	560720	the gamers should be able to, once they buy the disc, the purchase is there.
560720	566160	Once he did that systematic dismantling at E3 of everything the internet didn't like
566160	568560	about Microsoft.
568560	573920	And so that was an attack we haven't seen the likes of in a long time.
573920	576340	So that made things very interesting.
576340	577340	But anyway.
577340	578340	We don't even have to go back that far.
578340	582040	We just have to go back two weeks ago where you canceled your PS4 pre-order.
582040	584540	True.
584540	587080	But I don't necessarily blame Sony for that.
587080	588240	I just necessarily blame it.
588240	592520	And I think this is the boat we're all in right now of, we're just not ready for this
592520	593960	next generation of game yet.
593960	596000	And it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.
596000	598480	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
598480	603120	And for me personally, I look at what the PlayStation 4 has and at what the Xbox One
603120	605960	has and I say, eh, nothing there for me yet.
605960	610080	Well, Dan and I swore off system and phone launches.
610080	614960	You know, I'm getting my 5S at the end of the year instead of, you know, right when
614960	620500	it came out, we're getting our, probably getting our PS4 in February.
620500	623800	And we've pretty much decided that just because more stuff that we want to do is out on it
623800	625800	and it fits in better with the things that we want to do.
625800	626800	End of story.
626800	627800	Right.
627800	628800	To tell you what train that I'm on.
628800	634680	I'm on the Turbo Duo train, 16 bit forever, HuCards, heck yeah.
634680	637720	So anyway, I wrote kind of a response along those lines.
637720	639800	Karla wrote back and I do want to read this here.
639800	643660	It says, but most of the negative criticism is focused on two out of those consoles.
643660	647180	I can understand everyone has their favorite console, but if the show focuses on all gaming
647180	650140	platforms, it should reflect that in the show content.
650140	653660	Lately there has been a ton of negativity thrown at one console and that is pretty much
653660	655300	what I hear in every other podcast.
655300	659520	OLR was the exception, but not as of late, which makes me sad because I enjoy this show
659520	660520	more than most.
660520	661520	Thanks for the reply.
661520	662520	And you know what?
662520	664060	Thank you for engaging in respectful dialogue.
664060	668080	I really love these types of conversations as opposed to what you used to see in the
668080	669740	old YouTube comments.
669740	672200	Fuck you, you fucking fuck, right?
672200	676420	So I really appreciate kind of the respectful dialogue there.
676420	682020	As far as it goes, I can see where maybe last week, maybe kicking the Xbox the day after
682020	687400	they launched maybe wasn't the most tactful thing to do, but it's also kind of a realist
687400	689880	view of where some people's heads are at.
689880	693160	And I say this in general, and I'm going to come back to this theme a little bit later
693160	694160	on tonight.
694160	697460	I do like to think that we are fair to everybody.
697460	699440	There's going to be good days for gaming companies.
699440	701700	There's going to be bad days for gaming companies.
701700	705660	And we're part of that voice out there on the internet that talks about that.
705660	708020	And you know, just like, let's take Nintendo for an example.
708020	709020	We've talked a lot of Sony.
709020	710020	We've talked a lot of Microsoft.
710020	711020	We haven't talked a lot of Nintendo.
711020	713300	Nintendo absolutely has had their good days and their bad days.
713300	715820	And we've talked about, you know, we try to razz them both on this show.
715820	721260	For example, bad days, the swap note disabling, what?
721260	723620	That was, you know, and that, that just feeds into the whole Nintendo.
723620	726140	You do not understand online, that whole thing, right?
726140	731300	But then on the good side of Nintendo, dude, Nintendo released two game of the year contenders
731300	735980	on the same day in the new Mario 3D world and Zelda link between worlds.
735980	736980	That's a very good thing.
736980	738460	I mean, those are game of the year contenders.
738460	741900	Granted, it's going to be a rough ride to the top when you've got Bioshock Infinite
741900	747060	and Last of Us also this year, but let's not neglect that those are two rock solid games
747060	748380	that came out on the same day.
748380	749380	That's good news.
749380	755020	So, you know, and I could, I could think of cases for Sony and Microsoft as well.
755020	760180	I do want to encourage the listeners, you know, continue to, if you feel like your voice
760180	763220	is not being represented, by all means, speak up.
763220	764560	We want to hear where you're coming from.
764560	769620	If you think that, um, you know, maybe we're neglecting something about the Xbox one that
769620	773160	needs to be brought to the forelight, please bring it up on the show.
773160	777340	You know, I don't think we've ever said to somebody, you know what, you're wrong in your
777340	778340	opinion.
778340	781100	I like to think we haven't said that, you know, maybe, maybe we sometimes riff on each
781100	784260	other and yell at each other a little bit, maybe have said that, but we don't, you know,
784260	786300	we don't really want to tell people they're wrong.
786300	787300	Right.
787300	788300	Am I right?
788300	789300	Oh yeah.
789420	795900	I've been meaning to talk to you about Mass Effect, but you're wrong.
795900	796900	You're wrong.
796900	797900	You're wrong.
797900	798900	You can't deny a fact.
798900	799900	You are wrong on.
799900	800900	You cannot deny a fact.
800900	801900	All right.
801900	805860	But anyway, uh, I, I might be dragging this out way too much, but I just, I just want
805860	811000	to say, guys, again, we're here to present some other perspectives and sometimes that's
811000	812660	our perspective and sometimes that's your perspective.
812660	815420	And one thing I want to challenge our listeners to do, I don't think I got my thought out
815420	822940	on this, is that, you know, sometimes in gaming we tend to live in this bubble and it's the
822940	826740	way, the way you see it and the things, and I'm not saying this particular listener is
826740	827740	that way.
827740	831900	I'm not saying you, I'm just saying in general, gamers, gaming, look at comments on websites
831900	834020	and tell me you don't think this about some people.
834020	839160	Some gamers tend to live in their little bubble and they can't really see outside that bubble.
839160	842080	How could somebody possibly want an Xbox one?
842080	846000	How could somebody possibly want to spend a hundred extra dollars on this system with
846000	850760	this device you don't need and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, well, look outside that
850760	851760	bubble.
851760	853080	Maybe there's a reason.
853080	854080	Maybe there's that game.
854080	857780	And I'll tell you for me personally, next year is going to suck for my wallet because
857780	862360	I'm going to have to buckle and get a PlayStation 4 when they release Final Fantasy 14, the
862360	866400	Elder Scrolls beta, uh, the new infamous looks really good.
866400	869680	You know, there's a lot of stuff on PlayStation then on Xbox 360, guess what?
869680	874000	When they release a new halo, when they release quantum break, I got to pick up an, did I
874000	875000	say 360?
875000	876000	I'm an Xbox one.
876000	877840	When they release all that, I got to get an Xbox one as well.
877840	879200	So my wallet's going to be hurting next year.
879200	881640	I'm just waiting for those games.
881640	882640	All right.
882640	889340	Um, I do want to introduce our chat room live.vognetwork.com, uh, because we do tape live, of course, every
889340	892840	Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network
892840	896400	www.vognetwork.com.
896400	900680	And I'm trying to look at, uh, what some of the chatters are saying here.
900680	903520	We've been discussing physics.
903520	909080	So on, on task, apparently I'm, I'm seeing you talk about gigantic monitors and whatever
909080	914400	is going on there, because I said that I should be on NEC's payroll and someone asked if they
914400	915400	still exist.
915400	918480	And then we started talking about their printers and stuff, right?
918480	923400	But they, they made like these great flat panel, not flat panel, but flat screen CRT
923400	927040	monitors that were perfect for doing color matching.
927040	929240	I mean, it was almost like a print match.
929240	930240	It was so great.
930240	933120	And of course you can't really get a CRT monitor anymore.
933120	934600	Um, let's see.
934600	935600	S2 100.
935600	938720	Matt says, I remember the beginning of last generation, OLR was accused of being anti
938720	939720	Sony.
939720	943440	Well, a lot of internet was, uh, Brad says, uh, talk about what you know, we bought the
943440	945420	PlayStation four versus the Xbox one.
945420	947520	So that is what we can talk about.
947520	948520	And you're right.
948520	950640	We can talk about our particular reasons and so forth.
951320	954680	And then let's see some folks in chat, uh, some various people talking about kind of
954680	957720	the whole Microsoft and what happened recently with some of the bands they were doing, which
957720	959960	we're going to get into a little later in the show.
959960	965480	Um, Loki, I, I, you know, again, you don't have to apologize by any means for what you
965480	969520	said last week, because I got to admit, I think you brought up some points that, you
969520	973560	know, are worth thinking about and why there is some resistance to the Xbox one, but now
973560	978480	they've had a week to kind of simmer on it and black Friday going on and so forth.
978520	983720	Where's your head at now with generally PlayStation four and Xbox one and all of this, I gotta
983720	988320	say that sweet, sweet PlayStation four is a great value for this holiday at a retail
988320	990360	price of $399.
990360	991360	You can find it.
991360	992360	Okay.
992360	995560	I just don't want to do that because I'm not on their payroll.
995560	1001560	I really wish I was, you don't understand how much that would be so awesome to have
1001560	1007320	actual a, um, no, but, um, how do I see it?
1007760	1013760	My point last week was, and I guess it just didn't come through clearly enough, so I will
1013760	1021400	speak more clearly on it, um, that I thought Microsoft should have addressed the way their,
1021400	1024200	you know, defective systems were, um, differently.
1024200	1029160	And sure enough, a few days later, they finally came around and did it correctly.
1029160	1033880	Like I said, address the situation, resolve it with your customers, you know, instead
1033880	1039440	of letting them speculate about what the problem is or how wide of an issue it is and
1039440	1040560	stuff like that.
1040560	1041920	That was my issue.
1041920	1043280	They cleared it up.
1043280	1048640	So I'm, you want gaming companies to stop the smokescreen like, yeah, if you don't say
1048640	1050320	anything, people are going to expect the worst.
1050320	1052160	So that's kind of what it is.
1052160	1057320	You know that Microsoft did it at the beginning of the Xbox, you know, three 16 launch kept
1057320	1061760	playing down, you know, how many systems were affected by the red ring of death or whatever.
1061760	1065360	And, um, you know, and people didn't believe them.
1065360	1066360	Yeah.
1066360	1069360	I don't believe you that a small percentage of them are being affected by it when I've
1069360	1073360	had six, you know, it's just, it was ridiculous.
1073360	1076640	So I don't know, I think I'm a hard on everybody.
1076640	1080240	And if I'm not, then I need to try harder.
1080240	1081240	You are to be fair.
1081240	1082240	You are pretty hard on everybody.
1082240	1084880	Uh, when, when, you know, shut up.
1084880	1088880	But you know, I, it is kind of part of the reason I also see, you know, granted, we had
1088880	1091720	a lot of feedback to last week's show in that regard, but I also get other feedback.
1091720	1094740	That's like, I live for Loki rants.
1094740	1096360	I am here for Loki rants.
1096360	1097440	What pissed Loki off this week?
1097440	1098740	I've got to have a rant.
1098740	1101040	So, you know, there's, there's that on both sides.
1101040	1105520	There's been things, we'll, we'll see what we're going to get to tonight in tonight's
1105520	1106520	show.
1106520	1107520	But, um, again, I just wanted to respond.
1107520	1110200	And even though I only read one comment there, cause it was something public on Facebook.
1110200	1112520	I just wanted to say there was other like chatter.
1112520	1116480	So you know, I hope, you know, again, if you feel like there's a point that wasn't addressed,
1116480	1119240	please by all means, email the show mailbag at orange dontre.com.
1119240	1122360	You can post on Facebook as to, uh, Twitter and all that.
1122360	1124180	Um, let's get into quickly.
1124180	1125960	We're going to have Matt on in about 10 minutes.
1125960	1129960	So we have a little bit of time to do some of our gaming weeks, at least, uh, dark soccer.
1129960	1130960	You were out last week.
1130960	1133160	What have you been gaming on the past couple of weeks?
1133160	1136560	Uh, Final Fantasy 14, which every time I've logged on, no one's been on.
1136560	1137560	So whatever.
1137560	1143120	Um, and, uh, I really, cause I'm on a lot well, it's during the day and you people have
1143120	1144120	jobs.
1144120	1145120	Yeah.
1145120	1147600	I started my job, my contract work.
1147600	1148600	So I'm very happy.
1148600	1153520	Um, yeah, I, uh, I bought, okay, actually, actually this is going to be a story, so maybe
1153520	1156320	this will take the 10 minutes.
1156320	1159960	Dan's birthday was Friday on black Friday and we were like last week we need to do something
1159960	1160960	really nice for Dan.
1160960	1164360	So I was trying to get people who wanted to get in to buy Dan a present with me and he
1164360	1167600	had said up and down, I don't want a download copy of Zelda.
1167600	1172320	I want the physical copy, so I'm not going to get the package, blah, blah, blah.
1172320	1180520	So me and Becky and our cousin-in-law Hannah and George and Amanda all got together and
1180520	1187240	we got the money together to order Dan a red, uh, 3DS XL and I bought him Zelda.
1187240	1189240	I went out and bought it.
1189240	1193600	Turns out while I'm sitting in the bank trying to get my, my, uh, business bank account set
1193600	1200480	up so that, you know, it can work, Dan says, look what I bought, picture gold, you know,
1200480	1201480	3DS.
1201480	1204280	So I call him, I go, you are so stupid.
1204280	1207920	And this guy is like sitting next to me playing like bejeweled on his phone and he's laughing
1207920	1214960	his ass off because, and so anyway, it ended up, you know, they just gave the monies for
1214960	1218800	Dan to pay back what he paid on the thing and we kept the physical copy.
1218800	1224000	He gave the e-copy to George and maybe you were going to do something where you bought
1224000	1227480	the Zelda one and then like you sold the code to somebody else who really wanted it.
1227480	1230320	So I just kind of thought that's how things would go, but I, I liked the way you guys
1230320	1231320	did it.
1231320	1235240	And for the record bones, it actually was me because I was using Becky me in a subjective
1235240	1236240	content.
1236240	1237240	Context.
1237240	1244760	So you never end with, you never use I as a subject.
1244760	1250640	I mean, as a, as a object, it is a grammar throwdown going on in our chat room anyway.
1250640	1253760	Don't you dare step to me in my grammar.
1253760	1255120	All right, moving on.
1255120	1256120	Come on.
1256120	1258120	I will conjugate you to death.
1258120	1263600	Anyway, so, uh, as it turned out, George ended up picking up a Fire Emblem for Dan because
1263600	1272200	Dan loves his Fire Emblem and Dan's been playing, uh, um, uh, crap.
1272200	1273200	I just forgot it.
1273200	1274880	Oh, uh, Ace Attorney.
1274880	1279320	He's been really into it and hasn't been sleeping because he's doing the damn cases.
1279320	1288480	Um, also, um, at any rate, uh, what I've been playing is since he beat Zelda in like four
1288480	1293920	days, I'm playing it now and I just finished, uh, the Eastern palace and I like a lot of
1293920	1297680	the throwbacks to the, um, link to the past.
1297680	1299640	It was, I pretty happy with it.
1299640	1302360	I think it was a worthy purchase and one that we're both enjoying.
1302360	1308640	So, uh, as far as other things, I'm playing, still playing the Stanley parable off and
1308640	1312240	on just so, you know, cause there's so many different endings for it, but I don't want
1312240	1313240	it to get stale.
1313240	1314800	So I'm playing it a bit at a time.
1314800	1322320	I bought a game called the Shiva, um, which is about a rabbi and it's, it's a kind of
1322320	1326560	a, a horror story from what it looks like or an investigative story.
1326560	1328140	So like a mystery.
1328140	1330100	So it looked interesting to me and it was cheap.
1330100	1334320	And then I bought, uh, some other game called 9.3 M or something.
1334320	1335320	I don't know.
1335320	1336800	It was cheap too.
1336800	1342820	And uh, I've just been trying to get through what's in my steam library and you know, I've
1342820	1345400	got a few more things on my list, so we'll see what happens.
1345400	1348880	But my goal is to play a different game every week.
1348880	1352240	That's in my steam library, library, my library.
1352240	1355640	That's that's a lofty goal because you know that, that those steam libraries build up
1355640	1356640	quick.
1356640	1360860	Well, I've got enough games to play a different game every week for the next 10 years.
1360860	1361860	So I think I'll be good.
1361860	1365860	I could do that easily for a year and a half, even just uninstalled alone right now.
1365860	1367100	I could do that for at least a year.
1367100	1372300	I can probably talk about, uh, my own steam library, but I made, I made a dent in the
1372300	1375860	backlog this week and I will get into that in just a little bit.
1375860	1379260	But dark soccer, if you are done with your gaming week, I am, then I think we're going
1379260	1384620	to go ahead and we're going to go over to the phones, uh, and we are going to get our
1384620	1387220	buddy Matt Kahn on the line.
1387220	1393540	Matt Kahn is the founder of GamerX and he is behind a new Kickstarter for Read Only
1393540	1395500	Memories, a new cyberpunk adventure.
1395500	1399020	So we're going to ask him about, you know, what's going on with GamerX and what's going
1399020	1402500	on with this new game and how awesome is Snatcher and so forth.
1402500	1404140	Uh, and I believe Matt is there.
1404140	1405140	Matt, you on the line?
1405140	1406140	I am.
1406140	1407140	Hey, how are you guys doing?
1407140	1408140	I'm great.
1408140	1409140	Welcome to Orange Launch Radio, Matt.
1409140	1410140	Great to have you here.
1410140	1412100	Yeah, I'm super excited to be on the show.
1412100	1414460	I really wanted to come on for a while, so.
1414460	1415460	Thank you.
1415700	1418860	Oh my gosh, we should have had you on last time you had a Kickstarter to promote because
1418860	1424580	I gave a lot of money to that Kickstarter and it was, it was, no, it was totally worth
1424580	1425580	it.
1425580	1429260	I had, and thank you for, for putting that together and I know you have a whole team
1429260	1431340	behind you and they all deserve kudos.
1431340	1436220	Uh, GamerX, I had a fantastic time at GamerX and that was a, that was a great experience
1436220	1439940	and um, yeah, I, I can't wait for GamerX too.
1439940	1440940	Awesome.
1440940	1446780	We're really excited to, uh, to have GamerX too happening, you know, like, uh, we, when
1446780	1451180	we didn't get, you know, the original GamerX, we weren't sure if there would be the, you
1451180	1456380	know, the outcry for a second one, but, uh, people seem to have a really good time, so
1456380	1458700	we're doing a second one and we're really excited about it.
1458700	1459700	Awesome, awesome.
1459700	1464540	If you guys have questions for Matt, you can join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, I
1464540	1467580	got some questions of my own here and I'm sure some of us here in studio also have questions
1467580	1472300	for him, but I will be throwing in some of your questions as well as we talk about, uh,
1472300	1474820	GamerX and, and your latest Kickstarter and so forth.
1474820	1477140	Um, let me ask you a couple of things about GamerX.
1477140	1480500	So, so there is a GamerX too, that is happening this year, right?
1480500	1481500	Yep.
1481500	1485820	Or this next year, 2014, um, and I noticed one of the things I noticed right away, you're
1485820	1489180	like, the new venue is three times as big as the old one, right?
1489180	1490180	Yeah.
1490180	1494420	So, you know, uh, people seem to really like the con last year, um, but I think that, you
1494420	1500020	know, a lot of our, our, you know, um, first time kind of jitters showed off a little bit
1500020	1503220	in that, you know, we, we definitely overbooked the hotel.
1503220	1508860	Like, it was really crowded and, uh, we don't want people to feel, especially, you know,
1508860	1512580	with a, with a crowd like we have, like we don't want people to feel like it's a claustrophobic
1512580	1516220	or, you know, we want it to feel super comfortable and super homey.
1516220	1520620	And, uh, by going to the Intercontinental, uh, not only are we choosing a spot that's
1520620	1523900	really easy for people who live in the Bay Area to get to because it's right off BART
1523900	1528380	and all the major Muni lines, uh, but also it's, you know, it's so much bigger.
1528380	1533540	It's three times the size that, you know, even if we grow, you know, even double the
1533540	1537580	size of attendees, we'll have more than enough space to, uh, you know, make sure they're
1537580	1541820	all good and have a place to, you know, hang out and chill.
1541820	1545580	What would you say besides, uh, you know, cause, cause obviously this whole thing was,
1545580	1549900	was a real adventure for you from the Kickstarter to the execution and, you know, overall and
1549900	1553940	everything I heard about it was, you know, yeah, it was a little bit crowded, but you
1553940	1557740	know what, Oh, what a problem for a first year con to have that there's just too much
1557740	1558740	interest in it.
1558740	1559740	Right.
1559740	1562300	So, you know, most everything I was hearing was, it was really, really positive about
1562300	1565900	the convention and that's how I left, you know, pretty much feeling as well.
1565900	1568400	What would you say from this whole experience start to finish?
1568400	1572820	What was, what was the biggest lesson you learned that you could pass on to somebody
1572820	1578200	else who's thinking about maybe starting something of their own in their town or something for
1578200	1579680	whatever the cause is?
1579680	1586920	Um, you know, I think that, you know, we didn't, we, I don't know, because the thing that I,
1586920	1591960	I feel like I've learned the most is that, uh, you know, we went into gamer X or the
1591960	1596640	original one without having, you know, any real convention experience behind us.
1596640	1601280	And so we really overestimated the amount of, you know, major sponsors that were going
1601280	1602280	to come in.
1602280	1607400	And, uh, we spent a lot more money bringing in in terms of sponsorship.
1607400	1610800	Um, and so we were able to, you know, have a really awesome convention, but we spent
1610800	1615040	more money than we made, um, which is, you know, which is okay, but like when you're
1615040	1618720	running off of like, you know, we don't have any, any venture capitalists or anything,
1618720	1621600	um, you know, going into the red is kind of a scary thing.
1621600	1626560	Um, so I wish I had done better budgeting and also been a little bit more like, I think,
1626560	1631060	realistic with the fact that, uh, you know, because it was our first year, I think a lot
1631060	1635960	of companies were scared to kind of come on as, as, uh, as, um, sponsors.
1635960	1639640	And then also we got a lot of people who were just kind of like, they were too afraid to
1639640	1644400	kind of touch an LGBT thing, um, that it didn't really fit their brand.
1644400	1645400	Interesting.
1645400	1646400	Yeah.
1646400	1647400	Hmm.
1647400	1648440	Well now, okay.
1648440	1652320	So unfortunately I know our own dark soccer did not get to go to gamer X neither did Loki.
1652320	1654560	Um, but dark soccer is trying to make it at least this year.
1654560	1655560	I'm hoping.
1655560	1656560	I hope so.
1656560	1657560	You got it.
1657560	1658560	You got to come do a panel with me.
1658560	1659560	I had a ton of fun.
1659560	1663760	Uh, but, uh, our buddy here in studio, Jason actually went to gamer X and you are a straight
1663760	1664880	male who went to gamer X.
1664920	1665920	I very much am.
1665920	1667640	Were you persecuted?
1667640	1672480	Because some of the comments you read on the internet are like, I was scared in a fit.
1672480	1674160	No, not, not even a little bit.
1674160	1679880	I mean, I, the short version of this is that I was having a discussion about a month ago
1679880	1682800	about like the finer points, prejudices and all this stuff.
1682800	1686800	And I just kind of looked up and I said, screw the labels, be awesome to people.
1686800	1688320	It was the quick summary.
1688320	1691720	And I had a hell of a hell of a good time.
1691720	1694080	I was around plenty of people that I knew.
1694080	1699120	Uh, I met a couple of people involved, the, um, the guy that was doing visuals, uh, during
1699120	1702960	the performances on Friday and Saturday night, I wound up having a conversation with him.
1702960	1707520	I took over the booth for my coworker, uh, so he could go out and get some lunch.
1707520	1709840	I was talking to people for 30, 45 minutes.
1709840	1714960	It was as good as all the rest of the cons that I've been to better because it was even
1714960	1715960	more.
1715960	1716960	I go to anime cons.
1716960	1717960	They're okay.
1717960	1720040	It was more gaming centric and tech centric to an extent.
1720040	1721040	And I had fun with it.
1721040	1722040	Awesome.
1722040	1723040	Well, fun's what it's all about, right?
1723040	1728760	Uh, look at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, uh, DK pop man says, I want to go to a con
1728760	1730640	and a code man says, I wish I could go to these cons.
1730640	1733680	Uh, unfortunately I know these guys don't live out here on the West coast.
1733680	1735040	So it's a little more of an investment.
1735040	1738720	Uh, Rama says a lot of straight people go to yaoi con.
1738720	1740840	So yes, they do.
1740840	1741840	All right.
1741840	1743240	Um, so let's see.
1743240	1747040	I want to, I know you're, I know you're really excited about gamer X map, but I know you
1747040	1750560	also have this Kickstarter going on right now for this game.
1750560	1754400	R O M or read only memories, which is a cyberpunk adventure.
1754400	1756640	Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?
1756640	1757640	Yeah, sure.
1757640	1762280	So, you know, at gamer X, you know, we, we had a really great time and, uh, at the end
1762280	1766240	of the gamer X, we had, you know, our, our kind of, you know, dead dog, like, Hey, tell
1766240	1769640	us if you, what you hated or tell us your ideas.
1769640	1774000	And the thing that kept coming up in the question and answer was like, people were wondering
1774000	1777760	when we were going to do a game, they really liked our mascots.
1777760	1780720	And, um, it got us to thinking about the fact that like, you know, we have some really
1780720	1786680	cool mascots and, um, one of my big like things is like, instead of like, I don't believe
1786680	1787680	in complaining.
1787680	1792480	Um, like I feel like I could go out and, you know, and no disrespect to people that do
1792480	1798360	do this, but like I could, you know, uh, campaign to boycott things or make a video series or
1798360	1802380	do whatever, but I wanted to do something that I thought would, you know, create change
1802380	1806000	and like, so it created, I wanted to create this like safe, uh, space for, you know, queer
1806000	1807000	gamers.
1807000	1810160	And then in the same way, it was like, well, you know, we were in a position where we could
1810160	1816300	harass the EAs and you know, the Nintendos and Sonys and be like, why are there no queer
1816300	1817860	characters in games?
1817860	1821760	But we decided instead of doing that, like, let's just make a game that features gay and
1821760	1826400	lesbian and queer and trans characters in meaningful ways, isn't shoehorned in that
1826400	1828560	isn't like a joke.
1828560	1833000	And I think if we, if it does well and we can show that to people, um, I think that
1833000	1836600	we can kind of show the gaming world that, see like there is an audience for it.
1836600	1837600	It's not that hard to do.
1837600	1841400	Um, you know, like if anyone, if like, if we could do it without any experience and
1841400	1845520	just kind of like kind of starting from scratch, then you guys should be able to do it too.
1845520	1850680	And more selfishly, I mean, we want to make a game, like who doesn't want to make a game?
1850680	1851680	I love that.
1851680	1856400	Well, yeah, I remember one of the, one of the very popular panels at GamerX was when,
1856400	1859080	you know, one of the game designers got up there and said, all right, everybody, we're
1859080	1860320	going to make a game right now.
1860320	1861320	You're all game designers.
1861320	1864280	And I thought, I thought that was a really awesome approach to it because I honestly
1864280	1867660	looked at that and I went, oh my God, I wish I thought to do that for podcasting because
1867660	1870840	I'm so about like getting more people to podcast independent voices.
1870840	1872840	Why did, Oh, that was such a good idea.
1872840	1873840	You know?
1873840	1874840	And I just, I thought that was so awesome.
1874840	1875840	So yeah, make games.
1875840	1877080	You should do that next year.
1877080	1878880	I darn well might, Matt.
1878880	1880440	I might be talking to you off air about that.
1880440	1881440	Yeah.
1881440	1884720	So I mean like one of the cool things is like, I think you're mentioning Anna Antherby's
1884720	1885720	panel, right?
1885720	1886720	Yeah, exactly.
1886720	1887720	Yeah.
1887720	1889760	So, so she did a game workshop where she was teaching everyone how to use Twime, which
1889760	1893240	is a really easy to use system to make adventure games.
1893240	1897840	So one of the cool things is that our engineers who are working on the game, we have two guys
1897840	1906440	who are doing the programming right now, Ted Denola and Luke, sorry, Luke McCampbell.
1906440	1911720	And they're actually, they actually built a system where we actually, me and the people
1911720	1914880	who are non-technical, who are writing the story for the game, we're actually writing
1914880	1917060	out all the story stuff in Twime.
1917060	1922800	And they actually built a engine, a tool that will actually translate the Twime script into
1922800	1923800	Unity.
1923800	1924800	Oh, wow.
1924800	1927760	So that way, and then, so you know, once the game comes out, we're actually going to put
1927760	1932000	that tool up and that's going to become available for people to, you know, like use and like
1932000	1933800	other people to like use.
1933800	1938520	So hopefully it'll be easier for people who make Twime games to make visual Twime games.
1938520	1943560	That is a fantastic benefit to this Kickstarter that I want to make sure we call out here
1943560	1947040	and kind of highlight is that, you know, if, if, if this is successful and you're able
1947040	1952000	to put all that together, that can, that can be huge for other people wanting to do this,
1952000	1953000	right?
1953000	1954000	Yeah.
1954000	1955000	Yeah.
1955000	1957640	I mean, it's one of those things where like we, I think that there's a lot of people who
1957640	1963400	want to be able to make games like this and like, I have no idea how to program, like
1963400	1965080	I can't program at all.
1965080	1970240	And the guys who are making the programming of the game on our end, like they're pretty
1970240	1974160	much building out these systems so that way they're like, they can go, here you go, here's
1974160	1978080	what the, like they're basically making an RPG maker, you know, like basic system for
1978080	1979080	me.
1979080	1982440	So I can just go in and change the text, you know, add in what characters I want to have
1982440	1983440	and what places.
1983440	1987920	So that way they don't even, like I don't even need their help to make the game happen.
1987920	1992720	And once we have that there, like, you know, I feel like there's so many great stories
1992720	1998920	that should be told that I think Twime's great, but it'd be cool to be able to show some of
1998920	2000960	those stories in a more visual way.
2000960	2005280	Well, obviously, you know, when you talk about the visual and the presentation of the game,
2005280	2009680	there's many references in your Kickstarter, on the Facebook and so forth, to the gaming
2009680	2014560	classic Snatcher, which I know we here at OLR are very familiar with, you know, we love
2014560	2016840	Hideo Kojima and, you know, the things he's done.
2016840	2019880	And you talk about this in the Kickstarter and so forth.
2019880	2025820	What is it about that particular game that basically makes it like the framework or inspiration
2025820	2028940	or whatever you want to call it to tell your own story that you're writing?
2028940	2034820	I mean, well, Snatcher's definitely in my top five games of all time.
2034820	2039420	And looking at, you know, those top five games, Snatcher seemed like the one that would be,
2039420	2044140	you know, just from a more realistic perspective of like, what could we actually build with
2044140	2045140	a small team?
2045140	2050020	And, you know, a point and click adventure is something that we're like, okay, like,
2050020	2053340	that's something that we could definitely do and not overreach.
2053340	2059780	But it was also something where the setting of it, which is, you know, deep in the future,
2059780	2064060	in Snatcher it's 50 years in the future, so it's in the same, you know, vein, we're 50
2064060	2066580	years in the future.
2066580	2072420	You know, we can look at the way that the dynamics of queer culture have changed in
2072420	2078260	that, you know, back in the 20s, back in the 30s, if you had a kid and he was dating like
2078260	2081700	an Irish kid or an Irish girl or whatever, you'd be like, oh, you can't date those Irish,
2081700	2082700	you can't date the Polish.
2083060	2087020	It's like all that shit that like, by the 60s or 70s, no one even cared about that.
2087020	2090580	And then in the 60s and 70s, you know, you couldn't date out of your own race and things
2090580	2091580	like that.
2091580	2094780	And then people kind of, you know, like those people died off.
2094780	2099460	And now people are upset about people being trans or genderqueer or being, you know, gay
2099460	2100460	or lesbian.
2100460	2103280	And I think as people get over the gay and lesbian thing, then they'll start getting
2103280	2104780	over the trans and genderqueer thing.
2104780	2111240	And I think that by 2064, hopefully, you know, most characters in the game will have kind
2111240	2113300	of gotten over a lot of those things.
2113300	2117160	And so you'll see a lot more gay and lesbian and queer and trans characters that are in
2117160	2122840	positions of power or positions where they're not, you know, like on a different social
2122840	2127360	class as they're like, you know, comparatives.
2127360	2130840	But there'll still be other like, you know, prejudices, like whether that be people who
2130840	2135360	are against, you know, like I don't want my daughter to marry a robot, you know, they'll
2135360	2139640	definitely be, you know, like prejudices and like those things will always exist.
2139640	2143920	But hopefully, you'll be, especially if you're queer, you'll be able to play this game and
2143920	2149240	identify with gay or trans or queer characters that are in it that, you know, are, they're
2149240	2152240	not like just there because they're queer, and they're not going to be just good people
2152240	2153240	because they're queer.
2153240	2154240	But, you know.
2154240	2156080	Was that possibly a hint to the plot?
2156080	2159160	Because I picked up on, I know this is in the future, and you've got robots in this
2159160	2161360	game, and you just said, I don't want my daughter to date a robot.
2161360	2162360	Is that a little hint there?
2162360	2163360	What might be happening?
2163360	2164360	Yeah.
2164360	2168200	So, you know, there's a couple things that we want to introduce, you know, in the game.
2168200	2172760	There's definitely going to be people who are going to be like cybernetic.
2172760	2176760	You know, there's these devices called ROMs, and these ROMs can be, you know, we've only
2176760	2180840	shown off like how Turing looks, but ROMs can be really any size.
2180840	2184520	They can be, you know, like a wristband, they can be whatever.
2184520	2188040	Because you know, in the future, we're not going to really like need computers to be
2188040	2192800	much faster, and computer chips can be so small, they can really fit into anything.
2192800	2197340	So really, it's about whatever device fits your lifestyle, you know, the best.
2197340	2203900	And so, you may see people who end up becoming, you know, really dependent on those robots.
2203900	2208100	So you're going to see, you know, people who probably will develop relationships with their
2208100	2209100	ROMs.
2209100	2213020	Because, you know, like people even today, like they kind of fall in love with the internet,
2213020	2217380	and they're like, man, on the internet, there's all these people who, you know, like it's
2217380	2220060	a better life than in the real world.
2220060	2221060	That's very true.
2221060	2222060	That is very true.
2222060	2225660	You know, it's going to be interesting to kind of explore that, and one of the things
2225660	2230620	that I really want to explore with the game is, you know, I come originally from the tech
2230620	2237460	world, and I saw kind of how like kind of devious that people were in terms of trying
2237460	2243140	to get into people's privacy, and use that to, you know, do interesting stuff.
2243140	2248540	And I think that in the next 50 years, you'll see, you know, a real like all that privacy
2248540	2250380	will be gone.
2250380	2254060	And you know, like I think we're already kind of starting to see it, but it will be interesting
2254060	2258700	to kind of be able to talk about that, and actually have a little bit of experience of
2258700	2264540	like knowing some of the people who are actually like kind of putting these processes into
2264540	2270220	place now, and knowing kind of what they dream the future to be, and you know, living out
2270220	2271860	that world, and seeing if people like it.
2271860	2274380	Because, you know, there's going to be a lot of advantages to that.
2274380	2278900	Like your ROM will know the size of your clothes, and be like, hey, you need new boxers, and
2278900	2282700	there's probably, you know, H&M's having a sale, let's go right now, yay!
2282700	2283700	Interesting.
2283740	2285940	I like, yeah, the science fiction angle is pretty cool.
2285940	2288140	You've definitely got quite the story unraveling here.
2288140	2289140	I like this.
2289140	2290140	DarkSakura, you have something to throw in?
2290140	2295620	I was just saying, I was thinking about a little bit of a Shadowrun without the, you
2295620	2299260	know, extra fantasy elements that Shadowrun throws in, or I was actually getting a big
2299260	2301540	hit of rifts too.
2301540	2304020	I don't know if you ever did any tabletop RPGs?
2304020	2306900	Yeah, I played a little bit of Shadowrun.
2306900	2310900	So yeah, I mean, it's definitely something where like, you know, we want to kind of keep
2310900	2313600	it very close to that cyberpunk niche.
2313600	2319520	So you're going to see a lot of things that are, you know, like if you watch Blade Runner,
2319520	2324920	Snatcher, Rise of the Dragon, you know, anything that is like cyberpunk-y, like we're going
2324920	2327800	to try to keep that as much as possible.
2327800	2334000	While I think one of the biggest things that's changed is that in the 80s and early 90s when
2334000	2338160	a lot of these cyberpunk things came out, they never could have predicted for what the
2338160	2340320	internet would be.
2340320	2346400	And so in our game, we're going to acknowledge that the internet exists and that data is
2346400	2352920	like this unlimited source of data that can be transmitted anywhere at any time.
2352920	2358880	And it'll be interesting to see, but also apply kind of a lot of that cyberpunk CRT
2358880	2364720	monitor FM sounds, you know, like make it feel very 80s and a little backwards at times
2364720	2365720	too.
2365720	2370080	Once again, the Kickstarter is for a game ROM Read Only Memories.
2370080	2373440	If you want to check that out, unfortunately Kickstarter doesn't really have short URLs,
2373440	2377120	so I would encourage you to just search for that, Read Only Memories.
2377120	2382600	You can also back this and some of the rewards include, just for $6, it looks like, for $6
2382600	2387400	we'll get you the unlock code for the full version when it's released on Ouya or Mac
2387400	2389040	and PC.
2389040	2393280	Some of the other rewards, $20, this is the one that I actually personally did, where
2393280	2396840	you can get your name, company, or website in the credits, because I wanted to give a
2396840	2399360	little OrangeLawnsRadio.com love in the game.
2399360	2402080	Alright, I gotta ask, why the Ouya?
2402080	2405800	Oh, so, well, the cool thing is that they're gonna double our money.
2405800	2406800	Oh, okay.
2406800	2407800	Makes sense.
2407800	2412920	Basically, you know, all that we have to do is that when we launch the game, we're gonna
2412920	2417920	release it on Mac and PC, and if we hit a stretch goal, also Linux, and then also Ouya
2417920	2418920	at the same time.
2418920	2420240	So we're gonna release it on all four of those platforms.
2420240	2424160	That's right, I forgot that they open that up to where you can also publish on PC to
2424160	2428600	be qualified for their, you know, one of the games or whatever they call the thing.
2428840	2432800	So we're gonna release that game, and we're gonna release it on Steam and PC and Mac and
2432800	2434200	Ouya all at the same time.
2434200	2440680	And then, in the six months between when we release it on those systems, and then we release
2440680	2445720	it on iOS and Android, we'll spend those six months making sure that we fix any bugs that
2445720	2450160	may have been in the original releases, you know, making it suitable for touch screen
2450160	2453640	interfaces, you know, making improvements specifically for mobile.
2453640	2458360	So in actuality, it'd be cool if we released it all at the same time, but we can actually
2458360	2461520	use that time to make it better.
2461520	2466080	And yeah, I mean, like, it's free money, and it's something where, like, I'm a big fan
2466080	2470960	of the idea of the Ouya, like, I like the Android platform, I like the idea that people
2470960	2472920	can create anything and put it up there.
2472920	2477320	I mean, I know they've made a lot of PR mistakes, and I know that they're not, like, beloved
2477320	2482080	by everyone, and, you know, we knew that it wasn't gonna be, like, the best PR decision
2482080	2487840	to do it, but, like, there's really, you know, like, I still believe it's a good idea, and
2487880	2491400	I think that this is, like, that's the kind of system that our game would actually be
2491400	2497160	perfect for, where, like, a long-term story-based adventure game doesn't really exist on that
2497160	2501160	system, and, I don't know, I think that that might be something that PEW would be into.
2501160	2503160	That'd be pretty cool.
2503160	2505760	Let me, I wanna get to some of the chat room questions that we have, too, because we have
2505760	2510320	a few questions in chat, and I have a couple other questions I wanna ask, though.
2510320	2513640	One of them here about the music in the game, because I was, I was, I definitely noticed
2514160	2518720	you had some artists who agreed to help out with the game, Aethernaut, Ver, you know,
2518720	2521280	some names that people oughta know.
2521280	2523280	What kind of soundtrack you try to make with this game?
2523280	2528240	You know, so one of the things that was really cool about Snatcher was that, although, like,
2528240	2532200	it was a very, very simple game, like, it was just text, you know, select text, select
2532200	2536640	text, menus, it had really, really awesome visuals, but more importantly, because it
2536640	2542960	ran on Sega CD, it had really amazing music, and it was, you know, the music was way out
2543000	2547120	of proportion for the visuals, and in the same way, like, we wanna have very kind of
2547120	2553040	simple, kind of very, like, 80s, 16-bit visuals, but we want really, like, awesome music, and
2553040	2557200	so music has been one of the things that we wanted to focus on from the beginning, is,
2557200	2561640	you know, getting really awesome artists who want to come on, you know, come and be involved
2561640	2565480	with the game, and, like, you know, we actually just released yesterday on our Kickstarter
2565480	2570040	update, like, a style sheet of some of the songs that really influenced us, so, like,
2570080	2575720	you know, some of those include, like, games from the PC-88, and, like, the UNO field stage,
2575720	2582360	and Shin Megami Tensei IV, just all these, like, kind of, like, FM synth-y, very, like,
2582360	2585640	it's kind of hard to explain, but if you check out the list, we have just some of the music
2585640	2591040	that inspires us, and, um, Athernaut, and Vert, and Too Mellow, and all these people
2591040	2595120	that we're working with, like, they just really dug the vibe, and, you know, I think a lot
2595120	2599400	of them were big fans of Snatcher growing up, and they were really into the idea of,
2599400	2603760	uh, kind of giving it a try to, you know, making something cyberpunk-y.
2603760	2606920	Alright, I got one more question for you, and then we're gonna go to some of our chat
2606920	2610760	questions at live.vognetwork.com. It's not too late to get your question in if you have
2610760	2616720	a question for Matt Kahn, uh, with GamerX, and Read Only Memories. Um, Matt, I ask this
2616720	2621720	of everybody who comes on this show to pitch a Kickstarter, so I'm gonna ask you as well.
2621720	2627920	Um, the funding you're trying to raise for this $62,064, which is kind of a funny number,
2627920	2632120	but, um, what, what do you need that money for? Where is that money gonna ultimately
2632120	2633120	go?
2633120	2637360	Sure. So, um, couple things. So, you know, we, we've, we're working with a team of seven
2637360	2643080	people. Um, myself, I'm producing the game. We have, uh, John James, who's our lead artist.
2643080	2647240	Uh, we have, uh, I'm sorry, let me actually make sure I don't get any of his names wrong.
2647240	2653000	Luca Campbell and, um, Ted Danola, they're programming the games. Uh, Ted Danola is,
2653000	2657320	uh, he used to work at Zynga and Hubby Bunch Productions, and he's, like, was super duper
2657320	2661760	legit, and he's leading up the, the programming side of things. And so, you know, we've only
2661760	2665440	started, you know, really getting this program done in the last couple months, and things
2665440	2671000	have been ramping up super quickly, uh, with him. Um, and then we have, you know, uh, Tumelo,
2671000	2675200	and we have, uh, Fred, and we have, uh, all these other people who are working on the
2675200	2679780	music, and especially with, like, people like Athernaut and Vert, like, I could get
2679780	2683760	them to give us a good deal on music, but I'd rather that, like, they get paid a fair
2683760	2687600	amount for their work. Um, so, you know, we're just making sure, I wanna make sure that everyone
2687600	2691520	gets a fair amount, uh, you know, to work on this game. So between all those people,
2691520	2696240	and then we also have Shams, who's our CFO, mid-boss, and who's gonna be doing all the
2696240	2700880	fulfillment and stuff. Um, it's a lot of work, and, you know, so the money's mostly going
2700880	2707480	into paying, you know, those people. Then there's also the Unity fees, um, the, you
2707480	2711120	know, the actual distribution fees of getting those games out there, and then, you know,
2711120	2715080	uh, just, like, paying for, like, I wanna have more music, I wanna have more artists
2715080	2718780	come on board, and I wanna make sure they get, you know, treated right.
2718780	2722080	And I do notice you have some stretch goals to hopefully, hopefully if you can, uh, get
2722080	2726200	there, provide, uh, an actual soundtrack, OST, if you've backed to a certain level,
2726200	2730460	a Linux port, and possibly an art book at different stretch goal levels. But, uh, we
2730460	2735100	are looking at, uh, 11 days to go, and you've got about 20k to go. So you're, you're on
2735100	2739220	track, so, um, but, but, you know, every little bit helps, especially meeting those stretch
2739220	2743540	goals. Uh, if you guys are listening here at vognetwork.com, uh, or on the podcast feed
2743540	2747540	or on Stitcher, uh, definitely encourage you guys to check this out. Uh, you can keep tabs
2747540	2751660	on, uh, Matt's projects. Uh, gamerconnect.com would probably be the best place to send them.
2751660	2754380	I'm, I'm not sure where, where your hub is for, for all this.
2754380	2758300	Yeah. Well, I mean, we're actually making a bunch of changes right now, because, like,
2758300	2763200	you know, we, now that we're not just doing gamer acts, um, we're now kind of reforming
2763200	2768700	as mid-boss, in a way. So, I mean, now we have a game, and we have the, the, the convention.
2768700	2772780	We're working really hard on gamerconnect.com to get it up to, like, being something really
2772780	2775940	awesome. But it's just really tough, because it, like, it's basically, we're trying to
2775940	2781260	emulate a lot of features that Facebook has, and it's just hard with one person, you know,
2781260	2786540	programming it to keep it up. Um, but we, we actually just released, like, a new newsfeed
2786580	2790900	today, and we really want it to be a place where, like, if you're a queer geek, you can
2790900	2795620	go and talk about games and relax. Um, and, you know, we just need to put more work into
2795620	2800540	it and make sure that, like, it's, runs fast and looks good. And, um, part of that is just
2800540	2804860	we don't really have the money yet to, to hire people to do that. Um, but yeah, so if
2804860	2809220	you go to Gamer Connect, it has, uh, all, all of our projects. Uh, Gamer X 2 is next
2809220	2814340	July. Um, and you can get your tickets now. Um, and also, one of the cool things about
2814380	2820380	Read Only Memories is you can actually get tickets for Gamer X 2, uh, in the, the rewards,
2820380	2821700	um, for the Kickstarter.
2821700	2822140	Nice.
2822140	2827940	And, um, so, like, the, for the $79 level, that's only $9 more than a regular three-day
2827940	2832780	ticket. Um, and then for that, you get, you know, three copies of the game, you get the
2832780	2837540	beanie, you get the stickers, and you get a ticket to the con, and that money gets doubled
2837540	2841780	for us because of OUYA, so you're helping us out too. So, it's a good deal.
2841780	2844340	Awesome. Well, Matt, I hope we're not taking up too much of your time, but I do want to
2844340	2846740	get some chat questions, if you don't mind, just a couple quick ones here.
2846740	2847140	Yeah, sure.
2847140	2852460	Uh, DungeonBuster in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, asking, will ROM have action sequences like
2852460	2857100	in Snatcher? As good as Snatcher is, I think it could just stood well enough without them,
2857100	2860580	and if you do have them, will there, will there be an option to skip them?
2860580	2867580	Yeah, so, uh, I don't want there to be action sequences. Um, you know, I did not, so, I
2868500	2873540	didn't mind the action sequences in, um, in Snatcher. I actually thought that they were
2873540	2878660	okay. Uh, I, if you've ever played Policenauts, which is sort of like the spiritual sequel
2878660	2885260	in a way to Snatcher, um, I did not enjoy the action sequences in that. That was too,
2885260	2890620	like, with Snatcher, they had, like, the, um, like the grid format, they totally ditched
2890620	2895500	it for Policenauts, and this expected you had a light gun, um, so it's impossible to
2895500	2901420	play, like, as emulation or without the gun. Um, and then with Rise of the Dragon, it just
2901420	2908220	has the worst, awful, just disgusting arcade elements you've ever seen in your life. Like,
2908220	2912340	it's got this really cool gameplay, and then you go into the arcade elements, and your
2912340	2917140	character, when he jumps, he jumps, like, 30 feet in the air, and it just, it is, like,
2917140	2922140	it's disgusting. Like, if you, like, if you play it, you would be sick to your stomach.
2922140	2926780	Um, so that being said, you know, like, we also don't have, like, a ton of experience
2926780	2931540	with, you know, like, this is a pretty new team, and we have two really awesome programmers,
2931540	2937140	but, um, you know, I've seen what we're doing with the, uh, with the dialogue and inventory
2937140	2942540	and how we're working on that, and I feel like, you know, I don't want to shoehorn anything
2942540	2947340	in that isn't going to feel natural to the game. Um, if there is going to be minigames,
2947340	2952420	it would probably be more around, like, hey, you need to move these wires around to unlock
2952420	2956820	this puzzle. Um, so I would think that it would be more around, like, puzzle stuff,
2956820	2962660	and things, you know, that aren't, like, time-based or, or whatever, um, because I've, I've usually
2962660	2967220	found that in adventure games, uh, action scenes, while they're fun and they kind of
2967220	2972900	keep you on your toes, can be really, really frustrating, um, and not, and, and not very
2972900	2979220	fun, uh, because, um, um, it can be a blockade to progress the story, too, which I, I can
2979220	2982340	totally see that element of it, like, how many times have, like, forget it, I can't
2982340	2985500	get past this one thing in the game, forget it, I'm out, I'm out, and then, you know,
2985500	2990460	you would miss the story, so I, I totally, I totally hear you on that. Um, one more question
2990460	2995300	here from chat, this is a question about GamerX, uh, from SSJ100Matt in the, uh, chat room
2995300	3000300	at live.vognetwork.com asks, um, I understand this is still very new, but what do you see
3000340	3004660	as the future of GamerX, what is the next step, because this is a great idea that I
3004660	3011540	could see growing even more. Yeah, I mean, you know, our, our, the whole plan for GamerX,
3011540	3016980	we recently, you know, appointed a new president, whose, uh, name's Tony, and they are awesome,
3016980	3021980	um, and the, the idea for GamerX is, like, when we first created it, and when I first
3021980	3026740	created SFGamers, I wanted there to be a safe space for other, you know, gay and queer gamers
3026740	3032260	like myself, and I kind of used the word gamer because I kind of always kind of thought
3032260	3035940	that was a really super-inclusive word. Uh, you know, I always, but, you know, the more
3035940	3039740	I've, I've kind of met people, I've realized that the name is kind of, in a way, it can
3039740	3043620	be a little off-putting to straight people who want to come, and, and people who want
3043620	3050060	to come who aren't necessarily gay, uh, identifying, um, and I don't want the con to be something
3050060	3054380	where people feel uncomfortable going because of the name, or even because of the vibe,
3054380	3058540	you know, I want the vibe just to be a place where anyone, no matter whether they be gender
3058540	3065500	queer, or straight, or, you know, a furry, or an ally, or a trans, or bi, or just a woman,
3065500	3070860	anyone who maybe feels like they aren't culturally accepted by, like, the mainstream gaming media
3070860	3075220	to be able to come and feel like they're on an equal-level playing field where people
3075220	3078940	aren't going to judge you because of, you know, some preconceived notions of, like,
3078940	3081980	oh, well, you're a girl, so you can't play games, or you're gay, you can't play games,
3081980	3086380	or whatever, I mean, I think you look at, like, players like Scarlett, who almost just
3086380	3090140	won the world championships for League of, not League of Legends, Starcraft, and, you
3090140	3095100	know, who's a trans woman, and it's like, obviously, women and queer people can play
3095100	3099260	games, um, you know, I want it to be a place where everyone's treated with respect, but
3099260	3102180	I want it to also be a place where, like, if you're a straight person, like, I'm sick
3102180	3105580	of people being like, oh, I can't go to this because it's a gay event, I'm like, no, it's
3105580	3112340	like, it's not really like that, it's more like, um, almost, and I even hesitate to compare
3112340	3116700	it to this, but like an LGBT film festival, where it's like, you know, you might see some
3116700	3121060	films that have queer content in them, or you might have conversations that have, that
3121060	3125220	talk about some gay stuff, but like, for the most part, it's a gaming convention, and I
3125220	3129740	think that you'll find that most gamers, you know, care more about games than anything
3129740	3134140	else in their lives, but that being said, you know, the gays and the queers of us also
3134140	3138180	deserve to be able to feel comfortable and be able to flirt with one another in a safe
3138180	3139180	environment.
3139180	3143780	Um, an interesting response here from Queen Simia in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
3143780	3148820	says there's that, and I thought personally, if I attended GamerX as a straight cis woman,
3148820	3150420	I'd be invading a safe space.
3150420	3152740	I don't, I don't think that's the case at all.
3152740	3158100	No, no, I mean, like, you know, we actually had Anita Sarkeesian was there, and we had
3158100	3162140	a ton of really awesome women who came, who were just, you know, regular cis, you know,
3162140	3167020	just, you know, cis women, and, you know, they actually really enjoyed it, and like,
3167020	3172300	I feel like it's something where, you know, where it's kind of almost comparable to a
3172300	3177160	gay club, where it's like, a lot of cis women go to gay clubs in San Francisco because they
3177160	3181220	know that they'll be in a safe space, where they know that they'll be treated with respect,
3181220	3185420	and, you know, like, they're not going to be, like, groped on or, like, hit on, like,
3185420	3190580	unnecessarily, and just be able to dance and have fun, and in the same way, you know, like,
3190580	3196260	I think it's just, like, we, we, I think we as gamers, and by that I mean, like, queer
3196260	3200100	gamers, like, we don't want other people to not come.
3200100	3203620	I think that we want people to acknowledge who we are.
3203620	3207860	I think it, the more that people acknowledge, hey, that, you know, we are an existing group,
3207860	3211060	and that, you know, we're just like you and everyone else, like, that's really, really
3211060	3215400	important, because, like, I don't subscribe to that whole idea of, like, oh, we're making
3215400	3219620	gamer acts to make an exclusionary event, you know, you should only go to gamer acts
3219660	3223500	and don't go to PAX and don't go to E3, because, like, that's silly, like, people can go to
3223500	3228820	as many conversations as they want, what can I afford to go to, and this is just a different
3228820	3233140	experience that, like, one that, like, we're trying to kind of create, like, something
3233140	3235660	that's not really out there right now.
3235660	3240860	Yeah, you know, I gotta say, Matt, as, as somebody who, you know, for a period in my
3240860	3244940	late teens and early 20s, I literally thought I was the only gay nerd, like, I, I, there
3244940	3248620	was one, I thought I was the only gay nerd on the whole damn planet, so, to now, you
3248620	3252940	know, maybe, maybe now I'm in my mid-30s, but to see something like this happen was,
3252940	3256900	was really amazing, Matt, and I, I gotta thank you and your team for doing this, because
3256900	3261220	I'm, like, oh, my God, and I'm, I'm speaking from experience here, you guys, like, to be
3261220	3264940	that 18 or 19-year-old who is thinking that, like, I am the only gay nerd on the entire
3264940	3268980	planet to be, to be shown, like, no, you're not.
3268980	3271820	You're the only gay nerd in the village.
3271820	3277740	But, but, no, you're not, and to have, to, to kind of have that celebration, not just,
3277740	3283620	like, look, other gay nerds, but a celebration of all things nerd is just, I, it, it meant
3283620	3286380	a lot to me personally, and I was so happy to see it happen, so.
3286380	3287380	Oh, thank you.
3287380	3292300	I mean, like, that's kind of my whole goal with it, is, like, I think back to my 16-year-old
3292300	3296740	gay nerdy self and, like, how much of the time I would either hang out with gay people
3296740	3300580	and I would, like, have to hide being a nerdy, or I would hang out with nerdy people and
3300580	3306380	have to hide being gay, and I felt like I was living a lesser life than my true self,
3306380	3310020	and I feel like if people can look at GamerX and see there's thousands of other queer
3310020	3313940	geeks out there just like them, hopefully they won't feel like they're alone.
3313940	3317820	They feel, you know, the whole point of creating GamerConnect was so that way people can, you
3317820	3321180	know, can connect with their community and find other people in their community, and,
3321180	3325980	like, I remember, like, being in college and finding gaygamer.net and being, like, this
3325980	3331220	is what I've been, like, looking for my entire life, and I, I felt like if I can help other
3331220	3334460	people find that, like, that's, like, my calling in a way.
3334500	3336340	Uh, Jamie, you have one more thought here?
3336340	3338220	Oh, it wasn't a very big thing.
3338220	3341220	I was actually just wondering how the asexual turnout is.
3341220	3344980	Um, you know, we, so we don't obviously ask people at the door.
3344980	3347580	Well, I mean, but I was just wondering if there was representation.
3347580	3352340	Oh, yeah, I mean, so the thing is that, like, we, we try to accommodate, like, everything
3352340	3357420	in terms of, like, panels, like, I, I don't remember exactly what panels we had last year
3357420	3362580	off the top of my head, but I know that we had panels that, that, I know for sure that
3362580	3366140	we had panels that were submitted about, like, you know, it being asexual and being
3366140	3371460	in the community, and, you know, as someone who, I dated someone who was asexual, um,
3371460	3375260	I think that's, you know, like, I, I obviously don't think that there's any lifestyle that
3375260	3379340	isn't valid, but, like, I totally understand, and I want that, I think a lot of people have
3379340	3384180	a lot of ignorance about, um, people who are asexual, and I think that, um, more education
3384180	3388700	along those lines would be great, um, so, uh, although I can't, like, I can't speak
3388700	3392580	to the, to the attendance of it at that level, I would love to see more panels by people
3392580	3397300	who either identify as asexual, who want to talk about asexual, you know, ideas, especially
3397300	3400980	as they pertain to gaming, at GamerX, too, I think that would be super duper awesome.
3400980	3403660	It's, it's funny, I actually did have an idea for a panel.
3403660	3404660	Yeah, bring it on.
3404660	3406660	We better, we better write that down.
3406660	3410660	Asexuality and shipping, why it's a nightmare.
3410660	3415380	Uh, so, yeah, I, you know, GamerX, definitely a celebration of diversity, and I think it's
3415380	3417820	only gonna be a bigger celebration in this next year.
3417940	3423060	Uh, Matt, I wish you the best of luck with GamerX, too, and, uh, and your team, as well.
3423060	3427100	I know, I know, uh, Tony is, is leading it now, and, and, uh, it will, it will be fabulous
3427100	3429700	with the, uh, group that you helped assemble last year.
3429700	3430700	I know it.
3430700	3434500	Uh, and of course, with this game, Read Only Memories, a new cyberpunk adventure, please
3434500	3438300	check it out on Kickstarter, take a look at the video, and, uh, let's see if we can't
3438300	3442020	help, uh, Matt raise that $20,000 more they need to get it to happen.
3442020	3447420	Um, Matt, before I, I get any last plugs from you and let you go, I do have to ask you about
3447420	3451620	one other topic that's completely different, like, you were not prepared to talk about
3451620	3452620	this, you ready?
3452620	3453620	Yeah, I got it.
3453620	3458980	Alright, okay, I'm gonna bring it, because, here's the thing, now, DarkSakura, she doesn't
3458980	3460620	watch a lot of reality television.
3460620	3461620	No, I don't.
3461620	3467980	But, there is a show in Britain about Britain's worst driver, and they adapted it in Canada,
3467980	3470540	and you love you, you love yourself some Canada's worst driver.
3470540	3471540	I love Canada's worst driver.
3471540	3477020	Did you know that Matt, and this is on Wiki, so I know it's true, Matt was a contestant
3477020	3479220	on America's worst driver.
3479220	3480220	Really?
3480220	3485380	And, Matt, am I correct, now, spoiler alert, Matt, you won the whole damn thing, didn't
3485380	3486380	you?
3486380	3488380	Yeah, I am America's worst driver.
3488380	3494060	Oh my, now, I haven't watched the American one just because I heard that it was, like,
3494060	3497820	way too Americanized, because the Canadian one is just awesome.
3497820	3501980	It's like, we teach you how to do stunt driving, and you have to do all this.
3501980	3502980	It's very polite.
3502980	3506340	Yeah, well, it is, it is really, well, I don't know, there's this one girl who's kind of
3506340	3511740	freaking out on, they're doing worst driver ever this season, but what was it like for
3511740	3512740	you?
3512740	3516180	I mean, was it embarrassing to be on it, or did you learn something from it, or?
3516180	3521460	No, well, the thing is that, like, you know, at this point, I don't really care what the
3521460	3522460	challenge channel does to me.
3522460	3525700	I mean, so the whole thing was all scripted.
3525700	3530780	So like, each city that we went to, they would be like, okay, so the rules were, there was
3530780	3535460	eight, well, okay, so all scripted is maybe not exactly correct, so there's eight cities
3535460	3539140	that they would go to, and in each of the cities, they said, okay, so there's going
3539140	3542980	to be four contestants, and the worst driver in the city would have their car destroyed.
3542980	3546860	However, those contestants would then be brought back for the finale, where seven out of those
3546860	3549380	eight teams would win brand new cars.
3549380	3553300	So basically, they're telling you to lose, so that way you'd have a seven out of eight
3553300	3555780	chance to win a new car.
3555780	3562060	So in each of the cities, every single, like, it's super fake, because all eight episodes,
3562060	3567420	the people, everyone's trying to do the worst thing possible, and I was just able to win
3567420	3572060	in San Francisco, because I was trying to, I mean, I had a really crappy car, and so
3572060	3576580	I was willing to, like, basically total it on the show either way.
3576580	3580100	So I was just totally breaking all the rules, I was driving down Lombard Street and crashing
3580100	3582780	into shit, and I was having a blast.
3582780	3586620	If you watch the first episode, the first episode of the finale, first episode, I'm
3586620	3590540	having so much fun, I'm actually, like, I'm never tripping at all, like, I'm just like,
3590540	3595140	yeah, this is great, I'm having fun, and then in the finale, then it was, like, actually
3595140	3600900	a real contest, where they would have, like, elimination-style challenges.
3600900	3603780	It's something where they never let you watch the other people compete, and they don't have
3603780	3604780	any, like, times.
3604780	3610380	They have to be like, yeah, you won or lost, and someone during my SF thing actually carried
3610380	3614940	a stopwatch in their pocket, and the time that they got was completely different than
3614940	3618780	the thing they had in their pocket, which meant that they were like, yeah, this whole
3618780	3619780	show's fixed.
3620020	3626660	Anyways, as fixed or not, in the finale, I watched as, you know, as there's eight teams,
3626660	3630020	and I'm, like, super confident, and I'm just like, yeah, like, you know, I'm not a bad
3630020	3633060	driver, there's no way I'm gonna lose all these people, and I watched it go from eight
3633060	3637260	teams to seven teams to six teams to five teams, and, you know, watching my expression
3637260	3641300	and, like, I was wearing demon horns in the first episode, like, super fun, and, like,
3641300	3644660	having fun, and then by the time there's, like, three teams left, I'm like, shit, I'm
3644660	3645660	literally gonna lose.
3645660	3649020	I'm gonna lose not just my car, but, like, everyone else is gonna walk away with a brand
3649060	3653660	new car, which, before, they were like, oh, yeah, you can just take the value of the car,
3653660	3657860	so I was like, I'm gonna walk out of here with nothing, and then I got to two teams,
3657860	3661540	and I was like, oh, my God, and if you watch in the last scene where it's, like, me versus
3661540	3665620	the other team, like, me and my partner are freaking out, because I think we already know
3665620	3670260	that we're gonna lose, like, it's just pretty obvious it's, like, two, like, little shithead
3670260	3676060	kids versus, like, this, like, really, really, like, sweet, like, you know, like, older women,
3676060	3680460	not, like, older, but, like, you know, there are people who didn't deserve to lose versus,
3680460	3687020	like, two brats, and it was just, you know, I think I knew that, like, storyline-wise
3687020	3692700	we were gonna lose, I was panicking, and I wasn't driving well, and I lost, and then
3692700	3697220	they were like, oh, we're gonna, the Robosaurus is gonna destroy the new car, the person who
3697220	3701140	lost, and then, so, destroyed the car that I would have gotten.
3701140	3702700	Did they have Robosaurus in Canada?
3702700	3705980	No, this is completely different than the Canadian version.
3706420	3710220	Yeah, in the Canadian version, they basically pick, like, eight drivers from around the
3710220	3713900	different provinces who can't drive for a different reason, and then they actually go
3713900	3718700	through driver rehab, and if you get voted off, that means you actually were a good driver
3718700	3720560	when you graduated rehab.
3720560	3724020	If you win the whole thing, that means you are the worst driver.
3724020	3726300	You get, like, a trophy of crashed car parts.
3726300	3729860	Yeah, so we didn't get, we didn't get any training or anything, like, we just had the
3729860	3732460	first episode, and then they were like, come back to the finale, and they never gave us
3732460	3736100	any, like, training, they just were like, eh.
3736100	3739100	It just seems like the only similarity is the name, then.
3739100	3740100	Yeah, maybe, maybe.
3740100	3745460	Well, I had to, I had to bring, I know it has nothing to do with video games, but knowing
3745460	3748760	that Dark Soccer loves her, Canada is the worst, I had to ask you about that, and I
3748760	3751980	even see some comments in the chatroom, Code Man says, I've never watched this, but it
3751980	3755540	sounds awesome, Dungeon Buster says, it was cancelled after one season, yes, cancelled
3755540	3756540	after one season.
3756540	3759740	Dungeon Buster says, it was the worst show, it was so bad, I knew while we were filming
3759740	3763420	it was going to be cancelled, and it was so bad.
3763420	3765300	I love that you have a great sense of humor about it, though.
3765300	3768580	I just wonder if they had kept, like, the original format, if it would have lasted,
3768580	3771180	because, I mean, it's on its eighth season in Canada now.
3771180	3772180	We'll never know.
3772180	3775180	I bet you they would have, I mean, like, the thing is that when they're filming it, I could
3775180	3778980	tell it was going to be really bad, and then I found out the time slot was, like, Saturdays
3778980	3784060	at 10pm, travel channel, I was like, man, they have no confidence in the show.
3784060	3788100	Yeah, see, I've actually learned stuff watching the Canadian version, and I know Canadian
3788100	3789100	road signs now.
3789460	3791180	Are they that different?
3791180	3792180	I didn't realize.
3792180	3793180	There's some that are different.
3793180	3796180	Alright, Matt, we've got to let you go, thank you so much for having a good sense of humor
3796180	3800740	about that, and seriously, I mean it, I am so looking forward to GamerX2 and everything
3800740	3804580	your whole team's putting on, and best of luck with Read Only Memories, I hope you make
3804580	3805580	it.
3805580	3809140	Yeah, thank you so much for having me on, like, I'd love to chat more, and yeah, please
3809140	3813420	check out Read Only Memories, we still have tickets to GamerX2 on there that are, like,
3813420	3817420	super cheap, and if you back it on there, then we actually, we're just going to basically
3817420	3820740	double your money, so you're going to make a really awesome game on top of it.
3820740	3826180	Awesome, well best of luck to you guys, and yes, we'll keep in touch, and I will see you
3826180	3829780	at least at GamerX2, if not a heck of a lot sooner, because I'm in San Francisco, like,
3829780	3830780	all the time, so.
3830780	3835740	Yeah, we'll get some, you know, some really nice ethnic food, we can go get some Peruvian
3835740	3836740	food down in...
3836740	3837740	Awesome.
3837740	3838740	Good.
3838740	3841500	And then you can watch me have seven drinks, like I did last night, make a fool out of
3841500	3842500	myself.
3842500	3843500	Oh, right.
3843500	3845500	Alright, Matt, buddy, take care, and good luck.
3845500	3846500	Alright, man, have a great day.
3846580	3847580	Good.
3847580	3848580	Alright, take care.
3848580	3849580	Stop.
3849580	3850580	Alright, that was great.
3850580	3851580	I like him.
3851580	3852580	Yeah, he's fun.
3852580	3853580	He's fun.
3853580	3854580	Alright.
3854580	3855580	I'm trying to convince Dan to let me buy the $80 package.
3855580	3856580	Nice.
3856580	3857580	Dan, money.
3857580	3858580	Dan, package.
3858580	3859580	It's Hanukkah, for God's sake.
3859580	3866420	Well, it is, but he already bought me games, so.
3866420	3867420	Somebody give me 80 bucks.
3867420	3868420	Alright.
3868420	3869420	It'll go to a good cause.
3869420	3870420	It'll go to me.
3870420	3873100	I know that went on a little long, sorry, I think I ate more show than we intended to,
3873100	3876420	but Matt was a lot of fun, I had to ask him about the worst driver thing I had to.
3877340	3878340	Live.vognetwork.com, if you want to keep commenting.
3878340	3880980	You forgot to ask him what he was playing.
3880980	3881980	I did.
3881980	3882980	Shame.
3882980	3886700	What's more important, though, the where's the money going question or the what are you
3886700	3887700	playing question?
3887700	3890220	I think the more important one was the worst driver.
3890220	3891900	That was, that was the most important question.
3891900	3892900	Alright.
3892900	3898300	I'm sorry, that was awesome, and now I know that I'm glad I didn't watch the American.
3898300	3901540	Because I thought about going back to find it, because, you know, you know me, I've seen
3901540	3904900	every, except for the last two episodes.
3904900	3905900	You come in here all the time.
3906380	3907380	I hate TV.
3907380	3908380	I never watch TV, but Canada's the worst driver.
3908380	3909380	Oh my god.
3909380	3910380	It's cause I watch it on YouTube.
3910380	3911380	Alright.
3911380	3912380	We gotta get back to games.
3912380	3917220	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
3917220	3919220	use the passphrase, adult.
3919220	3922660	Quickly, let's try to get through the rest of our gaming weeks, and then some of the
3922660	3923660	news as well.
3923660	3924660	Loki.
3924660	3926620	So this week I played a few things.
3926620	3934900	I've been meaning to play Fallout New Vegas since last Steam sale, and so I finally got
3934900	3940340	around to playing it, and I did not like it, and I was so disappointed because I really
3940340	3943860	had high hopes for that game, and I just can't get into it.
3943860	3948500	I think it's just the game itself looks really dated, like I'm running it on Ultra, so it's,
3948500	3952180	you know, it doesn't look that pretty to begin with.
3952180	3956220	And I'm sure I could fix some of the stuff with mods, I just haven't gotten around to
3956220	3960460	it, and it's like I don't know if I want to spend the effort to do that right now.
3960460	3964420	But anyways, I just didn't like the setting.
3964460	3969300	I didn't like the story, because I didn't understand what the hell was going on, and
3969300	3971940	I just didn't like the way it played.
3971940	3977780	There's no fucking sprint for one, at least I couldn't find it.
3977780	3982220	So it was just, I don't know, it bugged me, it just rubbed me the wrong way I guess, and
3982220	3985700	so I don't know if I'm going to continue on with it.
3985700	3991460	That said, I also played Minecraft this week, just for a little bit.
3991460	3996420	I went ahead and updated my version I had on PC to get the latest thing, because they
3996420	4000300	just put an update out not too long ago, it's like 1.7.2 now.
4000300	4002060	I didn't realize that, I need to check it out too.
4002060	4009180	Yeah, they've got like, it's changed, like holy shit, the biomes now are really intricate.
4009180	4015180	Like I reloaded our seed that we had, and it's fucking terrible now, let's be honest.
4015180	4020380	I'm like oh my god, well this seed's terrible now, I hate it, I'm like in a fucking swamp.
4020380	4023820	Well what happened to my cool jungle that I was in?
4023820	4028820	So I just went ahead and, I just messed around with that for a little bit, but yeah, it's
4028820	4029820	pretty cool.
4029820	4033740	If you just do the new world seed or whatever, there's this huge fucking mountain that appears
4033740	4035900	right next to you, and that was kind of neat.
4035900	4040460	And then they also have the ones where you can spawn these really, I don't know what
4040460	4046300	they call it, basically exaggerated versions of the different biomes and stuff, almost
4046300	4050020	like extreme or something, and it looks really unique.
4050020	4052140	Very tall mountains and stuff.
4052140	4059340	I haven't gone around to setting up the multiplayer server, so I don't know about that yet.
4059340	4063980	Then also, I'm hoping for a VoG Minecraft server comeback in 2014, I'm hoping.
4063980	4066340	I have all the information to do it, I just haven't gone around to it.
4066340	4069580	There's no more Team Fortress 2 servers, so maybe I can redirect the money.
4069580	4074660	We have, well no, no, we have, Gali has offered us his server, so.
4074660	4078300	No hate against Team Fortress 2 by the way, I still love Team Fortress 2, it wasn't really
4078300	4079300	being used.
4079300	4080300	Yeah.
4080300	4081300	Next game.
4081300	4085340	Gali has a server up, but that's the thing that was getting people on it, because it
4085340	4088900	was a ghost town, most of the time.
4088900	4092220	That's kind of the problem with anything that we do, even Team Fortress 2 and stuff, it's
4092220	4094060	a ghost town most of the time.
4094060	4100740	So I don't know, and even Creative Mode gets boring after a while, survival at least, there's
4100740	4104300	something, if you're playing on your own, there's stuff that you can be doing, whereas
4104300	4108460	it's like, if you go into Creative Mode, it's like, okay, I'm gonna look around at what
4108460	4111900	people made, and what am I gonna build now?
4111900	4114340	Fuck if I know, I don't know.
4114340	4116820	So it's, there's just no happy medium there.
4116820	4121340	Okay, so anyways, enough Minecraft, and actually, it was just because I was installing it on
4121340	4126500	my friend's computer, so, because he has an account, he used to play with us occasionally,
4126500	4130140	and now I built him a PC, so I put it on there for him.
4130180	4135300	And then Steam Sale, I've been looking at stuff, I almost bought a lot of things, but
4135300	4140540	the only thing I bought is just the season pass for Saints Row 4.
4140540	4146020	Now I know I said I wasn't gonna do that, but it was on sale 66% off, and I feel that
4146020	4151020	the price of that is definitely worth what they're giving me, although what it gave me
4151020	4156260	instead of really shitty DLC was a thing that broke my game, and so now I had to uninstall
4156260	4158580	it, and I have to reinstall it and see if that fixes it.
4158620	4161900	I thought at first, oh, it's because I have mods that I made and put in there and stuff
4161900	4165980	like that, well I took all those out and it still didn't fucking work, so I'm a little
4165980	4171100	disappointed that it broke the whole game, so we'll see if I reload it, maybe it'll fix
4171100	4176820	itself and I can start slowly loading the mods in and see if that works again, but I'm
4176820	4181100	just, it's annoying, to say the least.
4181100	4188180	And then LittleBigGrandpaThoughtOfFive did a, got in the back of a train and got five
4188180	4193980	stars and was sniping people with my sniper rifle and stuff as Trevor, so that was kind
4193980	4194980	of fun.
4194980	4198380	I have to bring this up, you mentioned Steam Sale and Dark Soccer, because it was like,
4198380	4203380	oh, 6 o'clock, new Flash sales, so she just loaded it up on her iPad, and literally at
4203380	4206420	the same time we both pointed and went, Deadpool!
4206420	4209980	I don't care how shitty this game is, I don't care how shitty it is.
4210020	4215380	I'm getting the fucking Deadpool game because fuck, it's Deadpool, and I'm a consumer whore.
4215380	4216380	It's one of those nights.
4216380	4222180	Nah, I was trying to get Bobby to buy Saints Row, they had it down at $19, so I was like,
4222180	4223180	okay.
4223180	4227300	But yeah, so I've been good, I've been thinking like, okay, I'm gonna buy these games, like
4227300	4235500	I almost bought Fallout 3, almost bought, what was it, Far Cry 3, almost bought Rise
4235500	4240060	of the Triad, because that was down to like $5.09.
4240060	4244940	Still might, I don't know, but I'm looking at my library of games I have and I'm like,
4244940	4246620	I haven't played most of this stuff.
4246620	4248500	If I buy these, I'm not gonna play them either.
4248500	4252820	You need to make a resolution of yourself like Dark Soccer did, that you'll play one
4252820	4253820	a week.
4253820	4257420	I'm not playing one a week, okay, that's not gonna happen.
4257420	4263380	The wife is expecting a new baby soon, and so that means more than you might think right
4263380	4264380	now, Logan.
4265260	4271620	But like Bioshock, for example, Bioshock Infinite came down to about $7 on Gamefly.
4271620	4275100	I was like, you know, I should just buy it for that, but I'm like, no, I fucking played
4275100	4278900	through it on Xbox 360, am I really gonna play through the game again?
4278900	4279900	No.
4279900	4284540	Why am I cluttering my fucking account with these games I'm never gonna play?
4284540	4288860	So that's kinda where I'm at.
4288860	4293940	But there is a nice gap between now and when more games are coming out, so I do have time
4293980	4294980	to catch up.
4294980	4300020	I do want to play more Grand Theft Auto 5, but my wife has been wanting to watch Hulu,
4300020	4303980	and she doesn't like the Playstation 3 controller, because if you set it on the couch the right
4303980	4308580	way, or not the right way, it accidentally taps one of those analog sticks and fast forwards
4308580	4313100	and she throws a fit, I'm like, ugh, fine, so, you know, and I wanted to play with my
4313100	4319020	360 character to get it up to where my PS3 character is, but I may just have to go PS3,
4319020	4320020	I guess.
4320020	4321020	Alright, anything else?
4321020	4322660	We gotta keep moving here.
4322660	4323660	I can't log in.
4323660	4324660	Aww.
4324660	4325660	Well, the good news is you-
4325660	4326660	I'm still gonna get home.
4326660	4327660	Yeah, you have until, like, 2 AM.
4327660	4329380	Alright, I'm gonna try to quickly go through my gaming week.
4329380	4333300	A lot of the usual suspects, a lot of the same stuff I talked about this week, continuing
4333300	4337940	to progress in Zelda and Mario and so forth, but I also fell victim to the Steam sale,
4337940	4342100	I picked up a few games, I'm gonna try to make this quick, a few games I picked up.
4342100	4344100	DLC Quest, I bought.
4344100	4345620	I did remember what the game I bought was.
4345620	4346620	What's that?
4346620	4347620	Shadowrun.
4347620	4348620	Oh, okay.
4348620	4349620	Oh, what were you talking about earlier?
4349620	4350620	Yeah.
4350620	4351620	DLC Quest.
4351620	4356180	Like, I like DLC Quest as like a commentary, and obviously it's a little bit biting on
4356180	4358740	the state of DLC and so forth.
4358740	4366260	It was a dollar on sale, and that's- it was a fun little adventure game, a little silly,
4366260	4369580	it's not particularly difficult, I beat it in one sitting.
4369580	4375780	There is an expansion, like the freemium isn't free or something like that was the expansion,
4375780	4377780	and I'm in the middle of that right now.
4377780	4382260	The game's not really particularly difficult, and at its core, you've really played a game
4382260	4386940	like this a thousand times, because since the coin is, you know, the coins that you
4386940	4391820	used to get the quote-unquote DLC are just things you pick up in game, we've all played
4391820	4395740	that game where it's like, now you have to get this item to go unlock this door.
4395740	4399540	Now you need to get this item to get past this- you know, we've all played a game like
4399540	4402180	that before, it's a very common formula in games.
4402180	4406140	I'm not razzing this game for that, because again, it's a budget game, it's an indie game.
4406140	4407140	It's also pretty old, too.
4407180	4411620	Yeah, it has been out a little while, and you have to remember it's more a commentary,
4411620	4417180	and it does have a funny little script to it, and I did lol a few times, so you know,
4417180	4420900	for a dollar or even three dollars or whatever they're asking for it normally, it's a fine
4420900	4427060	little evening jaunt through DLC Quest, so check that one out.
4427060	4430940	I also checked out a game called Splunky, which I'd been wanting to check out for a
4430940	4434860	long time, and then finally when it hit, what, four bucks or whatever it was, I was like,
4435380	4440060	I like this game an awful lot, I am fucking terrible at it, but I find that I'm learning
4440060	4441060	more and more.
4441060	4445660	I'm gonna tell you what I love most about Splunky, I am a whore for roguelike games.
4445660	4449480	You know, the roguelike games, like Back to the Old School Rogue, and you know, Rogue
4449480	4454620	Legacy even is like a roguelike game, obviously, Splunky's kinda like that too, and you find
4454620	4458500	more layers of the game as you progress, like, oh, I've never seen this item before, what
4458500	4459500	does this do?
4460140	4466820	You know, all the levels are randomly generated, it's fun, and one thing I love a lot about
4466820	4472740	it is it really reminds me of a classic PC game, but kinda done in modern context.
4472740	4475980	I don't really know how else to put my finger on it, but I just feel like when I'm playing
4475980	4481260	it, I'm playing like an old game on the Commodore 64, but that looks like a game on the PlayStation
4481260	4484060	3 or the modern PC or what have you.
4484060	4489340	So I enjoyed Splunky, I was surprised there's no internet multiplayer, but there's local
4489340	4492860	multiplayer, but there are like challenge boards where one, you know, you'll have a
4492860	4498220	certain level set that you can only play once per day, and you go as far as you can, and
4498220	4499620	once you're done, you're done.
4499620	4502860	There's a whole community around this game, like live streams of people doing that and
4502860	4508300	so forth, so I enjoyed Splunky, I think I got it at a steal, I think the game is worth
4508300	4511420	whatever they're asking for, normally like $15 or what have you, right?
4511420	4514940	So Splunky, I will probably be talking about this game more in future weeks, we have a
4514940	4515940	little more time.
4516300	4523340	Last game I picked up, Gone Home, I bought for $5 and it was on sale, and I will tell
4523340	4529980	you this, I was, I started Gone Home at about probably 9 o'clock on Friday night, I just
4529980	4533860	kind of said, alright, I need to check out this game finally, I started playing it, I
4533860	4538300	did not get up out of my chair, except maybe to use the restroom and get water, until I
4538300	4544540	beat the game at about 1am, so I played this thing from start to finish, I was really into
4544540	4545540	it.
4546140	4550300	I will say this, and this is probably a common thing you're going to hear about Gone Home,
4550300	4559580	it's not really a game, but it's definitely an interactive story, I feel like it's best
4559580	4565500	described, this is how I felt about it, it's like a first person movie, imagine you control
4565500	4573100	the movie, that's kind of what this game felt like to me, at its core, I could probably,
4573140	4576860	I'm not going to, but I could probably spoil the whole damn thing for you in three sentences,
4576860	4580900	like the whole game, I'm not going to do that, because that would be a dick thing to do,
4580900	4587380	and I think watching the layers of it unfold, it's not so much the punchline quote unquote,
4587380	4592020	like I could tell you those three sentences that would ruin the game for you, but at the
4592020	4598580	same time I think it's about how we get to that, and all those really kind of unsettling
4598580	4603460	things and the way things are presented in the game that really made this game a very
4603460	4608100	special experience, I'm just going to say it's not for everybody, because some people
4608100	4613500	are going to play this and be like, wait a minute, this is not the game I was expecting
4613500	4618140	at all, so you got to be prepared that it's going to be a little bit more of a story that
4618140	4625260	slowly unravels, and there's really not like challenge to it per se, there's no monster
4625260	4628460	that's going to jump out from behind the curtain and eat you to death, although you
4628460	4633060	might get that impression from what you see about the game and so forth, it's actually
4633060	4636100	very much not like that at all.
4636100	4644020	My one issue with the game is that because I think it was trying to present itself one
4644020	4648400	way and then kind of end up being another sort of story, I feel like there were things
4648400	4652220	in a context that weren't fully explored, I'm being vague on purpose because I don't
4652220	4655700	want to ruin this for you, but I felt there were certain things that didn't really get
4655700	4657100	explored enough.
4657100	4662060	When the game ended, I did feel resolution, I felt satisfaction, I felt like, wow, that
4662060	4666780	was a good movie I just watched, like I really felt that when I finished the game, except
4666780	4669500	I was like, but what about that subplot?
4669500	4674380	What about this subplot didn't really resolve, I'm not sure if I missed something or something,
4674380	4678540	and I'm trying to think of a non-spoilery way to say this for people who have played
4678540	4680620	the game.
4680620	4684200	The uncle, I'll say that, so if you've played the game you'll notice, but the uncle, I kind
4684200	4688300	of feel like that was left unresolved for me, whereas everything else was fine.
4688300	4695240	So for $5 it was definitely worth it, I think the game normally is like, what, 10 or 15,
4695240	4699740	I just want to caution you, although I felt it was good and you would pay 10 or 15 for
4699740	4705820	a movie, some people may not feel the value when it's only going to take you 3 to 4 hours
4705820	4710220	to beat, if that, some of you will probably fly through it faster than me, I'm very, you
4710220	4714140	know, OCD with the games and looking at every little corner, which actually pays off in
4714140	4717060	this game immensely, I just want to kind of warn you that.
4717060	4720380	Now there are some things they do to try to enhance the value, like there's a director's
4720380	4724220	commentary mode you can play through and so forth to try and encourage a second play and
4724220	4728660	so on, but I just want to warn you, if you're expecting like, oh I'm going to buy this game
4728660	4733460	and it's going to give me hundreds of hours of satisfaction, think of it more like a movie
4733460	4740220	because that's kind of what it is, it's more like an interactive movie, but I sort of,
4740220	4749360	I sort of really love, how do I put my finger on this, I just kind of love what I think
4749360	4756660	this game may have started, for, that was incredibly distinct and clear, I know right,
4756660	4761860	I feel like this is going to be the first, or maybe not even the first, because I can
4761860	4765420	think of other games I've played like this, but I think this is going to be a definitely
4765420	4768900	notable, and you're seeing it getting game of the year nods and so forth and so on, I
4768900	4773540	think this is going to be one of those games where we look back and we go, you know, this
4773540	4778740	is the point that this art form really started to take off.
4778740	4783060	I guess that's the best I can say without like totally ruining things, sorry guys.
4783060	4787900	Alright, anyhow, clear as mud, I know right, right there with you, alright, if you want
4787900	4791100	to talk spoilers we can maybe later, I gotta wait for the six months to be out, has it
4791140	4794860	been out for six months, when it's been out six months I can talk spoilers, because that's
4794860	4800220	the agreed upon moratorium on spoilers right, I'll encourage you don't go out there and
4800220	4803740	spoil it for yourself, because again it could be spoiled for you in three sentences and
4803740	4807380	there's some real dickheads that spoil it in comments and so forth, I really think it's
4807380	4814460	best experience getting in there and doing it, alright, Jason, quickly, your gaming week.
4814460	4819100	Pretty light week because Monday through Wednesday we're spent wrapping up everything at work
4819140	4826140	and then I've been around doing a lot of different things, my sale haul was that I picked up
4826500	4831620	a two pack of Divekick and I need to figure out what to do with the second copy, I picked
4831620	4838540	up Splunky as well, Final Fantasy 7, the Bioshock triple pack and Counter Strike Go, still not
4838540	4842460	entirely sure why because I've never been good at that game or anything of the sort
4842460	4848260	but I have it and Raginator has thanked me numerous times both in chat and then he mentioned
4848260	4855260	it when he called into Bobby's show, Bobby Black Wolf, 6pm Pacific, 5pm Pacific, 6pm
4856340	4861980	the time zone you're used to, so close, as he sat on his call I picked up the Saints
4861980	4866140	Row pack for him, he was talking about it, he wanted some stuff to play, it was dirt
4866140	4871100	cheap and it is a lot of content, I really enjoyed Saints Row 3, so I threw the pack
4871100	4876860	his way, because I've been moving around so much this week I've actually gotten back into
4876860	4881980	the mobile swing of things again, I picked up Sonic Dash which is just an endless runner,
4881980	4886260	time killing kind of game, I've been very addicted to Quiz Up in the last week or two
4886260	4889980	and me and Rob played around with it the other night, that is a fun little iPhone game, very
4889980	4894220	fun, it's very well curated, which means in 60 days we'll no longer be playing it, that's
4894220	4898740	what happens to iPhone games, and then there was the other, was it just those two, I feel
4898740	4905120	like there was a third game that I've been playing, Phone or iPad rather often, but probably
4905120	4909860	just Quiz Up and Sonic Dash, the usual suspects, a little bit of Rogue Legacy, a little bit
4909860	4918060	of FTL, FTL randoms were abysmally terrible and I just got destroyed before I even hit
4918060	4922880	like the third sector, and a couple more power ups in Rogue Legacy, still plowing through
4922880	4926600	that, trying to get further, pick up more equipment, pieces of equipment and upgrades
4926600	4929120	and all that, the usual.
4929120	4933400	Alrighty, let me quickly do some housekeeping and then we'll go into the news for tonight,
4933400	4937040	so as always I do want to encourage you guys to follow us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash
4937040	4941460	Orange Lounge Radio and then we'll also be on Twitter, Twitter.com slash O-L-R, I want
4941460	4945700	to address the YouTube expansion real quick because last week I mentioned I put the show
4945700	4952340	up on YouTube, it took me a little while to do and so, and I've kind of been able to watch
4952340	4955680	like oh how was it received this week and so forth, so I kind of made a decision on
4955680	4959280	how we're going to kind of treat the YouTube thing going forward, so this is how it's going
4959280	4963360	to work is that we will post the episodes to YouTube, obviously there will not be video
4963360	4967680	so there's just going to be audio for archive purposes, we will post the shows to YouTube
4967680	4972120	but we're going to post them on a one week delay and you might be thinking like what,
4972120	4973360	why would you do that?
4973360	4977920	Well because I love the idea of like YouTube for like the archive purposes and so forth
4977920	4982040	and kind of being able to go find your favorite parts of the show and so forth and all that
4982040	4987600	but I'm going to just keep it real with you guys, we want the hits at OrangeOnTrader.com
4987600	4992440	and BogNetwork.com, I mean YouTube is great for discovery and so forth and branching out
4992480	4999480	to that audience but it really helps us in being able to you know get into, sell the
4999920	5006440	show as media and help with events and so forth if we can get the hits with OrangeOnTrader.com
5006440	5012400	and so forth so the podcast and Stitcher and TuneIn and those sorts of apps that tap into
5012400	5017120	the official podcast feed, those are the ways we sort of prefer that people listen to the
5017120	5020260	show so those are the ones that we're going to support with the immediate Sunday night
5020260	5027180	uploads but we will continue to support YouTube on the delay, I will say this though just
5027180	5031840	so that if you're like a YouTube dedicated person I don't want you to get upset because
5031840	5036060	definitely we're exploring what are other ways we can actually get involved with actual
5036060	5039780	video on YouTube, I know I've been doing that a lot through my own channel, plug plug Rob
5039780	5045340	Roberts Plays, plug plug and I'm sure there will be more stuff to come in the future so
5045340	5049680	stay tuned for you know things that aren't just audio archives of the show and hopefully
5049680	5055300	some more interactive content over on the YouTube. Alright let's get into some gaming
5055300	5057800	news, we're going to try to move through it quickly because we're already an hour twenty
5057800	5061400	minutes into the show but we'll try to get through this quickly, Loki why don't you start
5061400	5067280	us off with some news tonight. Alright so as we mentioned last week there have been
5067280	5073800	some people using Playroom on the Playstation 4 as a means to kind of broadcast themselves
5073800	5080520	almost like a talk show format or whatever and some people have been abusing that to
5080520	5086640	broadcast themselves doing pornographic things which I'm personally fine with but apparently
5086640	5094360	Twitch isn't so because of that Twitch has momentarily removed the Playroom content from
5094360	5099360	the directory because they say the majority of it was non-gaming related and they may
5099360	5108320	add it back later on if you know the gameplay stuff is more gaming related later on I guess
5108320	5115800	I don't know so oh well it's all it takes is a few people to run it for everybody. This
5115800	5119680	is I mean there was a part of me that was like oh that's so frustrating I mean it's
5119680	5122720	not that I'm like sitting here going oh Twitch shouldn't have done that I mean they kind
5122720	5128160	of had to because people were you know abusing it or whatever but I was just like damn it
5128160	5133400	really sucks that there wasn't a way to really kind of manage that and I don't know what
5133400	5138520	you could do I mean it's the whole infamous TTP joke we make here on Orange Lawns Radio
5138520	5143240	where you put a new peripheral out there and what's the time to penis how long before somebody
5143240	5148240	puts their dick in it or shows their dick on it or so forth. Or draws a dick. Exactly
5148240	5152800	as we found with this it wasn't very long at all and that's why it's you know gotten
5152800	5156040	pulled and so forth there were some really disgusting things that were going on on Playroom
5156040	5159200	like I'm not I'm not just talking about like showing body parts there's really disgusting
5159200	5164560	things happening. Yeah I saw them. So yeah well so I understand completely why they pulled
5164560	5169760	it but damn it because there was some great potential there for people to start their
5169760	5174800	own homegrown broadcasts and get voices out there and so forth I guess you could still
5174800	5178600	you do that on Ustream so I would encourage you if you were one of those people that was
5178600	5184860	like shit I could have used Playroom to start my podcast or to start my video show don't
5185060	5189180	let that discourage you completely you could feasibly still do Ustream it's gonna be a
5189180	5193780	little harder to build an audience but you know what you gotta start somewhere. Or you
5193780	5198940	could probably get drivers for that camera eventually and. Yeah that'll happen too. I
5198940	5203820	don't know I think that has a special adapter for it though or a special like proprietary
5203820	5208420	plug or something but you know they'll come out with something I mean they did it with
5208420	5212860	you know with the Kinect and stuff so that and honestly it doesn't probably cost too
5212860	5218780	much to get you know some sort of webcam and a lot of computers have webcams built
5218780	5223780	into them or even laptops and stuff so you know I wouldn't say you can afford a you know
5223780	5227740	PlayStation 4 you probably could afford a you know a webcam if you really wanted to
5227740	5232980	do that. Yeah so yeah and I'm all for more voices more broadcasting getting out there
5232980	5238420	so just you know kind of on a side note but damn you people that had to go do nasty shit
5238420	5245980	on Playroom and really ruin it for everybody. Jerks. Alright moving on some changes going
5245980	5250060	on with Miiverse and this has to do with the integration between the 3DS is gonna be coming
5250060	5254540	on board and they're getting Miiverse so there's been some changes with Miiverse that happened
5254540	5259820	this past week and obviously this is to support this whole consolidation. Some new display
5259820	5264220	options in the community list you can display more communities at once there's also gonna
5264220	5269300	be communities based on categories like Wii U software, Virtual Console and assumably
5269300	5275500	3DS and so on. Your profile will no longer display the total number of YAS you've given
5275500	5279580	which was basically how many inches your Nintendo E-peen was was right there on your profile
5279580	5283500	like how many people have clicked like on my post that's not there anymore so there's
5283500	5290100	no more competition I suppose. You can still see your YAS on individual posts. Also the
5290100	5294460	default display setting in the community when you entered the community before you
5294460	5300080	would see everybody's posts. Now it defaults to only showing you posts from people who've
5300080	5305980	actually played the game. You can take that out and look at every post if you want to
5305980	5309980	but I kind of understand that change. I do. You want the discussion to be people who've
5309980	5313860	actually played the game. It's unfortunate for the people who might be popping in there
5313860	5318540	to ask is this you know would I like this game but there's other places on the internet
5318540	5324120	you can go for that really. The Miiverse integration of Mario 3D World is a lot of
5324120	5330180	fun though. I really crack up at some of the stuff I see. Miiverse is so interesting. Just
5330180	5334260	when you think Nintendo really doesn't understand online whatsoever you kind of look at Miiverse
5334260	5340700	and go nobody's really doing that and it is kind of neat like when it works. Anyway one
5340700	5344780	other thing that is neat to be a part of if you're lucky enough to be there you might
5344780	5349060	actually get a free Wii U console if you end up on the right Southwest Airlines flight.
5349060	5353460	Yeah a Southwest Airlines flight. Apparently Nintendo and Southwest Airlines partnered
5353460	5358720	up. Nintendo is like the official video game company of Southwest Airlines. There's gaming
5358720	5363020	lounges in some of the heavy traffic Southwest airports which would be what like Las Vegas
5363020	5369300	I imagine has got to have something and they're giving away games and so forth and Flight
5369300	5375860	1883 which went from New Orleans to Dallas Love Field last week they gave over 100 passengers
5375860	5380020	a brand new Wii U console. So it's just kind of different ways to I mean we might be sitting
5380020	5382980	here looking at that going that's kind of weird but it's just marketing it's just different
5382980	5387940	ways to market you know. Sony's doing something about PS4 on Facebook so yeah one of their
5387940	5393220	those reblog campaigns. Yeah they gave away two of them at the Sharks game last night.
5393220	5398940	So you know and I'm sure an Xbox they they went to some YouTubers houses and were giving
5398940	5403700	them Xbox. Some of their vocal critics were giving them Xbox ones. Francis was the one
5403700	5408260	that saw one. Apparently they're not listening to our show. I know right. That was the only
5408260	5412340	reason you were so mad. Loki you were just trying to get a free one. I'm not mad at all.
5412340	5418420	Like I said I'm not going to turn down free but you know. Anyway so yeah Fly More Southwest
5418420	5423660	I suppose if you want to possibly win a free Wii U. That's a good excuse to go Southwest
5423660	5428060	as your airline. I don't know what. The most entertaining flights I've ever had were Southwest
5428060	5433440	flights. That's true. Let's just go to Disneyland a bunch. Well see I do not not again we're
5433440	5436620	not commercially endorsed but I do have to give JetBlue a shout out because I do love
5436620	5442380	those TVs because I flew cross country and watched five hours of SpongeBob SquarePants.
5442380	5447420	Best flight best flight ever took to New York City. That sounds awful. For the record. Haters
5447420	5452520	gonna hate. For the record. What. Crap what was it. It wasn't Delta. It was something
5452520	5459640	I when I flew to Alabama. Seriously the worst thing ever. It was US air I'm sure. Oh American
5459640	5466480	American Airlines. Awful. All right. What do you have for us. I have some crap because
5466480	5475300	this is a bunch of crap. So once again Shenmue three ain't happening. That whole trademark
5475300	5484400	application. Fake. Sega's like no. Didn't we tell you this for the last ten years. No.
5484400	5488340	Now I think there's a silver lining to this we'll get into later in the show but there's
5488340	5495100	another fake too. Go ahead. For a Fallout 4. Well it's gonna happen eventually. We all
5495100	5499660	know Fallout 4 is going to happen. But the one that's up right now has like a fake trailer
5499660	5505280	and everything and it's no. So and you know there's been a ton of this with Blizzard related
5505280	5509920	products to a fake trademark. So you know I think the lesson we all need to learn from
5509920	5515760	these various fake trademark stories. Stop running with articles. Just stop on trade.
5515760	5522720	Just stop. But trademarks don't mean anything anymore. So trademarks patents stop. Yeah
5522720	5528040	probably something else too. IMDB pages. Stop. Yes stop. All of it. Not news sources. These
5528040	5532120	are no longer credible news sources done. You're saying 4chan's not a reliable news
5532120	5539320	source. I hate to offend but you know I just. In places I think to go for gaming news that's
5539320	5544720	not really at the top of the list. Biting gaming commentary perhaps but not for gaming
5544720	5550640	news. For the record SpongeBob is the devil. Whatever. Hater. He's not the devil he's too
5550640	5556760	dumb to be the devil. Alright. I seriously tried to watch that episode an episode of
5556760	5561240	that and I thought I could feel my brain melting. It was awful. It's just fucking Ren and Simpy
5561240	5565600	under the sea. That's all it is. I mean Ren and Simpy was cool. Do you hate Adventure
5565600	5570160	Time too because that shows. No I love Adventure Time. I don't get you because I love Adventure
5570160	5574280	Time too. But I heard the game is not so great. A friend told me that the game is like it's
5574280	5578520	only fun if you have like multiplayer but like a single player it's the why why are
5578520	5581560	we in the dungeon. I don't know or whatever that game is called. I've heard it's great
5581560	5586760	for multiplayer but for single players. I almost picked it up. Yeah. Yeah. If we find
5586760	5593240	it on sale we should do a multiplayer. I found a used copy. Just tell me which system you
5593240	5598000	guys get it on and I'll bug my D3 rep to give me a copy because he loves me so. How about
5598000	5603480	you get three copies. Yeah I don't think that's gonna work. Or four Jason wants one too. Alright
5603480	5607240	let's travel around the world and check out release dates. There might not be a lot but
5607240	5611120	we'll try anyway. Release dates. This is easy because I already memorized this one. There's
5611120	5615480	only one game coming out this week and that's Gran Turismo 6 and it's on Friday. Nice. On
5615480	5622160	PlayStation 3. Lots of cars. Pretty big. Pretty big game. Yeah. We don't have to wait three
5622160	5628240	years. Alright and so it will actually be happening. Now how can we prove to Bobby Blackwolf
5628240	5632520	that the game will actually be coming out because he doesn't think Gran Turismo 5 ever
5632520	5636600	happened. This is actually happening. It hasn't been delayed. They announced it was coming
5636600	5645440	out you know quarter four 2013 and we're in quarter four 2013 no delays so we're all good.
5645440	5649920	So what we need to do is we need everybody to go to like you know your local game store
5649920	5653760	wherever it is when you see Gran Turismo 6 sitting on the shelf you need to take a picture
5653760	5663120	of it and put it on Twitter. Hashtag believe me Bobby. And and you can drive on the moon.
5663120	5668760	Get the fuck out. You can drive on the moon. You can drive on the moon. Is it moon patrol?
5668760	5672200	No they have a moon you have a moon lander that you can drive and there's actual achievements
5672200	5676060	for driving on the moon. If you can have aliens and Bill Clinton in a hot tub at the end of
5676060	5684560	Cruise and World then you know. Alright going to Japan you have a little more to look forward
5684560	5688840	to this week. Gran Turismo 6 is there as well but there's some other games as well. Metal
5688840	5694300	Gear Rising Revengeance gets a special edition on the PlayStation 3. Daikokai Jidai Online
5694300	5699760	Gran Atlas is released this week. Kaihu Shoujo Sin in regular and limited edition also this
5699760	5705240	week and there are Gran Turismo 6 PlayStation 3 bundles this week so if you're in Japan you've
5705240	5709240	been holding out on a PlayStation 3 and maybe this is the game that's going to do it for you
5709240	5715200	believe me Bobby it's out in Japan this week so there you go. Also the Walking Dead comes out in
5715200	5722120	Japan. Is this the I'm trying to look real quick oh this is the Telltale version the good one not
5722120	5726560	the crappy shooter this is the good Walking Dead comes out in Japan this week I imagine it must
5726600	5730000	finally have been localized and that's why it's just now getting released. Remember if it's
5730000	5735240	survival instinct use your instincts to not buy it. Yes absolutely no this is the good Walking Dead
5735240	5741120	coming out on PlayStation 3 this week in Japan. Going to the Xbox 360 Batman Arkham Origins on
5741120	5749160	360 this week also there's an Xbox 360 slim with a 320 gig hard drive being released this week I'm
5749160	5753880	not sure what that's in celebration of it just an excuse to get another 360 on the shelf I suppose.
5753880	5759960	On the Vita this week Batman Arkham Origins is there as well and there's a new lime green white
5759960	5764840	pink black and light blue white Vita's those those models are making their way out this week. Also
5764840	5768280	tear away which has been getting really good reviews over here I haven't played it myself
5768280	5774520	yet but tear away finally gets its release on the Vita this week in Japan and looking at the Wii U
5774520	5780720	and the 3ds you have Batman Arkham Origins on Wii U also Dragon Quest 10 the which is the Dragon
5780720	5784640	Quest online this must be some type of price reduction oh no it's the Wii U version because
5784640	5789680	it was originally out on Wii so the Wii U version finally makes its entrance to Japan this week and
5789680	5795320	all those of us in America are just sitting here going when do we get a turn and the answer may be
5795320	5800880	never unfortunately but on the Nintendo 3ds bravely default for the sequel Geist Crusher
5800880	5810560	Inazuma 11 Go Galaxy Big Bang and Galaxy Supernova and some Hello Kitty purses and pouches four

5833680	5842120	2 HD steamworld dig for Mac and PC and bravely default for the sequel on 3ds and then on the
5842120	5849160	sixth the Scribblenauts Unlimited for 3ds and Wii U. All right just a few more stories for you guys
5849160	5856920	than the classic game of the week but first Loki. I just realized that Just Cause 2 multiplayer is
5856920	5862560	coming back or is coming to steam that's fucking awesome so seriously buy Just Cause 2 if you
5862560	5868160	haven't already because it's like two bucks multiplayer without but like the thousand people
5868160	5875600	at a time. You're given an awful lot of endorsements tonight. Dude it's a it's a sandbox game with guns
5875600	5883840	and vehicles and stuff and grappling hooks with a thousand people at one time. I mean come on that
5884080	5888640	sounds fucking awesome. Granted that should have been especially with grappling hooks. Anyways
5888640	5900320	so Microsoft of course you know they're gonna be launching the Xbox one in Japan later on in 2014
5900320	5909120	and to go along with that they are teaming up with some developers or Japanese developers to be exact
5909160	5915680	to offer some games that may be exclusive to the Xbox one platform and of course those haven't
5915680	5924280	been revealed yet but they will be full Japanese games and not like you know digital games like
5924280	5931120	Panzer Dragoon or something like that and of course announcements coming later on about that
5931120	5937800	I'm not sure where they're supposed to announcement or you know announce all that stuff but soon
5937800	5944840	hopefully since I want to say they're launching in the spring I may be thinking PlayStation 3 but
5944840	5952680	I don't know that's kind of neat at least they're seems to be taking it kind of seriously you know
5952680	5958760	so maybe kind of a turnaround for what we saw in the 360 Microsoft really wants to get their foot
5958760	5964000	in Japan Japanese households maybe we'll see something like you know we saw with like Blue
5964000	5968920	Dragon and stuff like that you know maybe something along those lines I imagine too this is
5968920	5973280	timed because the Xbox one is not out in Japan but perhaps they're gonna start you know before it's
5973280	5976560	released there in 2014 they're gonna really start to get some of this news out here you know they
5976560	5981160	got there they have leveraged Square Enix to give them another Dragon Quest game maybe Dragon Quest
5981160	5985600	you know was it 11 11 or so maybe on 11 now because they're probably not gonna get 10 well
5985600	5992080	never say never you know and the end if Microsoft reverses its policies Microsoft could get Final
5992080	5998360	Fantasy 14 realm reborn too it's it's known that Square Enix wanted to do it for 360 and it's just
5998360	6001960	Microsoft's the one that did not but they they will not budge on the cross servers thing that
6001960	6006320	and I I props to Square Enix for not budging on that so it'll be interesting if they can kind of
6006320	6010680	sit together at the table they did it for 11 they can do it for 14 that would be interesting very
6010680	6018160	interesting all right um also interesting of note news coming out of Japan Super Mario 3d world the
6018160	6025160	sales figures are in and well unfortunately it doesn't look great there's some conflicting
6025160	6030760	reports about how much it's sold media create says they sold just under a hundred thousand
6030760	6036800	units of Super Mario 3d world and for me too says it was about 107 K so either way you're looking at
6036800	6043920	about a hundred thousand sold here's the thing to put that into perspective Mario 3d land three
6043920	6050080	hundred and forty four thousand that's the 3ds one Super Mario Sunshine two hundred and eighty
6050080	6054880	thousand which you know of the modern games it seems like sunshine gets dumped on the most I
6054880	6062160	just thrown it out there Super Mario 64 on the 3ds the remake hundred and twenty still sold more
6062160	6068000	than Super Mario 3d world now I'm not saying this are those like lifetime sales or is that no first
6068000	6072440	week sales are all first week so oh no god oh all those games sold over a million except for
6072440	6077920	Sunshine actually didn't in Japan sunshine ended with seven hundred and eighty nine thousand and
6077920	6082480	change but here's the thing I don't want this to be like oh we're kicking Nintendo while they're
6082480	6089240	down or the sky is falling or whatever but I bring this up because you know I I you know Nintendo
6089240	6093840	ain't going bankrupt so stop those rumors and that shit survive the virtual boy they'll survive
6093840	6099200	this I was gonna mention the numbers are on VG charts for North America are they I didn't know
6099200	6103840	they were out yes they they're always a week behind but two hundred and forty three thousand
6103840	6111160	Wow okay so interesting not exactly a bust Europe did it come out over there in Europe let's see
6111160	6119560	here Europe mmm I guess it did not come out over there yet yeah that's a very interesting silver
6119560	6123920	lining is that it sold twice as many in the u.s. as it did in Japan that's very interesting it
6123920	6128760	more than twice hold on let's give me weird for dates here okay and then yeah they're saying 101
6128760	6137120	101 798 is in Japan I'm gonna check Europe again because give me a weird date oh they don't see
6137120	6143840	that's it they don't have last week they only have up to the 16th so the the problem that people are
6143840	6148400	really identifying with this is that you know for the install base of the Wii and this is important
6148400	6151880	to say for the install base that the Wii U has currently we all know that we use struggle in a
6151880	6156880	little bit it's no secret so for the install base at the Wii U has those numbers aren't bad but the
6156880	6161360	problem is is the game was expected to push more we use sales and that we're not seeing that really
6161360	6167400	happened in Japan yet again I think it's a little too early to say the sky is falling completely but
6167400	6171440	I think there are a lot of us that are rooting for Nintendo and and really hope they can turn
6171440	6177280	it around but it's gonna I really wish they had had a second game like this to really kick I mean
6177320	6182520	they certainly have it on the 3ds but I wish they had a another game to kind of kick out the gate
6182520	6187920	this winner with this to really get people talking I guess you could say Zelda Wind Waker but again I
6187920	6194640	just something kind of new I don't know I I just to really push those Wii U units because I
6194640	6199480	definitely don't want to see Nintendo fail none of us do well that's the thing is I'm curious to
6199480	6206320	see what they're selling as far as you know we use systems because you know it's good that they
6206320	6211680	sold those games but I'm sure that they have more than 200,000 we you know we use systems out there
6211680	6218040	and I just be curious to see how that's actually translating to new sales you know what a very
6218040	6222440	interesting point in our chat room at live dot vog network comm made by dungeon buster who says
6222440	6227560	lightning returns also sold considerably less than its release window in Japan when compared
6227560	6233440	to Final Fantasy 13 2 which was lower in opening sales than Final Fantasy 13 it just sounds like
6233520	6239320	the sales were soft for titles in general in Japan and that legends all linked between worlds
6239320	6247360	294,000 and that's that's like you know that's through the 23rd that's day one sales yeah not
6247360	6253880	surprised that I games amazing um and SG 100 Matt says the game came out at a bad time with all the
6253880	6259080	new consoles coming out now not Japan though remember Japan didn't have a PlayStation 4 and
6259080	6264120	Xbox one till next year but Xbox one no but it was still imminent for the PlayStation well
6264120	6268100	Nintendo's kind of competing against themselves in a way in Japan right now with 3ds I mean sure
6268100	6273920	Sony's trying to up the presence with a Vita and it's you know it's somewhat working but Nintendo's
6273920	6279560	biggest enemy in a way is a 3ds gaming on the go don't underestimate how huge gaming on the go is
6279560	6284640	over there I mean obviously considering all the devices that you kids are all distracting yourselves
6284640	6293440	with right now clearly well not this week but to your credit you don't have Animal Crossing right
6293440	6301200	now I didn't even consider my purse and I have Zelda plugged in right now actually I know yeah
6301200	6306720	go ahead I should log in you should should open the gate no I I definitely agree with that point
6306720	6312480	that it's trending mobile and when you're trying to hold on to uh you know like the same the same
6312480	6318200	issue with PC desktops and everything else these long these older inflexible yeah they may have
6318200	6324400	more features but you cannot play them anywhere else without difficulty you're right mobile is
6324400	6331800	the up-and-comer and it will be biting sales in out from a lot of other things all right well
6331800	6337240	we'll see I mean again week one let's let's see how this game does through the holiday season we'll
6337240	6343320	see but it could be very interesting to see what this is gonna have Nintendo doing in 2014 but you
6343320	6348480	know what it's not over it ain't over all right uh let's move on you know what let's move back to a
6348480	6354160	classic time when we didn't fucking stress on how well a game sold because we didn't find out for
6354160	6358240	like three months because we got all our news from magazines I want to know what's up with Jason's
6358240	6367080	monkey hat you're talking about on the 3ds right yes well let's let's travel back to a time when
6367080	6371120	we were getting our news from magazines and we were playing classic video games on classic
6371120	6375720	consoles back when the Nintendo that was on the block was the Super Nintendo it's a classic game
6375720	6379960	of the week y'all where dark soccer jumps into the vault picks the game that she thinks hey you
6379960	6385640	should be playing this why cuz it's rad tonight's pick definitely rad dark soccer which picked me
6385640	6390520	I picked marble madness just because I had that stupid level two music stuck in my head doo doo
6390520	6395880	doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo never pick this game before it's so good I
6395920	6404160	was never a superfan of marble madness because it pisses me off sorry very loud dongs from from
6404160	6410200	marble manas sorry guys but the best music was the level two music for the record at any rate
6410200	6418920	it was designed by Mark Kearney and it came out in 1984 it was an arcade game it was being it was
6418920	6423080	one of the most innovative games when it came out it used the Atari system one hardware and
6423080	6430520	programmed in C one of the first games to be programmed in NC on the hardware it was also the
6430520	6439080	first to use true stereo sound previous ones use simulated stereo or mono so this one basically in
6439080	6445040	fact I'm actually just gonna pull this quote right here it was the designer drew inspiration from
6445040	6451880	mini golf racing games and MC Escher which we can totally see where that came from so basically the
6451880	6458800	way you play marble madness is you are a little marble and you work your marble through a mazes
6458800	6466080	of different kind but you use a trackball although home versions used different controllers with
6466080	6472920	directional pads which is probably why I hated playing it on the nest so yeah you have a different
6472920	6478280	you know you can do practice each one has a theme there's even like a backwards level where you go
6478280	6487040	up instead of you know the usual down the course type of method the other thing with this one too
6487040	6497480	is that it was just a really freaking bizarre and neat game for its time I mean what was trying to
6497480	6503480	think of what the word I'm trying to think of for the perspective isometric thank you isometric
6504360	6510200	it uses an isometric perspective you're looking at it on diagonal it simulates a feeling of three
6510200	6515160	dimensions very nicely sorry I'm just watching this awesome bad I know right here on YouTube
6515160	6519560	and he's in that upside-down level right now and I'm just remembering what a mind fuck that level
6519560	6524040	was because like gravity goes the other way you just you don't know how mad bad that messes with
6524040	6531920	you tell you play it oh yeah I mean the whole game was just such a neat game and I mean on top
6532000	6535560	this is an arcade when he's doing it with travel you have to play this game with a trackball if
6535560	6541960	you want to play with any kind of accuracy I do believe actually have this on Atari 5200 I want
6541960	6550200	to say because we've got a trackball anyway um moving back into some of the background on the
6550200	6556040	game actually the guy who was working on this was supposed to be doing a video game version of
6556040	6560920	thriller Michael Jackson's thriller and it was canceled so they moved into Marvel madness this
6560920	6568680	particular one at his time was using a 19 inch CRT monitor and a Motorola 68 0 10 central
6568680	6576560	processing unit and it just basically was pretty tech heavy for its time I mean it was at the edge
6576560	6586160	so as far as other and there's actually there are whole just different has a programming tricks
6586200	6595600	that went in this game it did shadows to control anti aliasing it did a light ray tracing I mean
6595600	6601120	the technology behind this game it's a programming Marvel for its time I mean to be honest there are
6601120	6605200	there's actually I believe the whole site full of nothing but concept sketches that went behind
6605200	6612800	this and the programming direction really neat stuff so it was a big commercial success there
6612800	6618200	were 4,000 cabinets sold and it was its highest-earning game in arcades at the time but
6618200	6626080	then it fell after seven weeks and really it was because it's such a short game but it is still
6626080	6633920	people just got frustrated to hell there really the lot of thing is that because it was it took
6633920	6640680	such a high level of skill to play that's what made it really just an attractive game to have
6640680	6650560	a game to play so with that too there were other versions and a potential sequel and I will go
6650560	6657000	ahead and put this out there I think that super monkey ball was definitely influenced by this
6657000	6664200	game easily so as far as other versions there was a tiger electronics handheld LCD game which
6664200	6672600	I had and rare released the Nintendo version there I mean they were all very simple they you
6672600	6679800	know weren't as great clearly as the arcade one other versions that came out were of Amiga Game
6679800	6687680	Boy Sega Mega Drive the spectrum PC and GBA just all kinds of different versions of course we've
6687680	6692920	seen the rereleases on more modern systems in the various Midway compilations and Williams
6692920	6699560	compilations there was an arcade sequel that was planned in 1991 called marble mad marble madness
6699560	6708600	2 it was in development by Kearney's partner for the first one Bob Flanagan but it just it was
6708600	6716520	supposed to expand have invisibility flight modes pinball games set in between the levels and three
6716520	6725240	player isometric racing but it just didn't happen there were prototypes that were out for location
6725240	6732040	testing but you know what it was going against at the time Street Fighter 2 and that was also in
6732040	6737880	testing at the time so yeah so they went off of that and went to guardians of the hood instead
6737880	6743400	which is a beat-em-up game but there are the prototypes exist and you can find I'm sure you
6743400	6752600	can find ROMs of them so I would love to see what people think about it but as far as I mean that
6752600	6757280	goes there were some spiritual successors to I mean I said you know super monkey ball kind of doing
6757280	6764400	the successor thing there were there was a Archer McLean's Mercury switch ball never ball marble
6764400	6770760	blast gold that's on Linux and Mac OS and Windows it came out in 2003 balance and I'm thinking that
6770760	6778200	because there's two elves in it just a different one so but nothing is the original nothing will
6778200	6784440	piss you off and make you hit nothing will make you love you love a trackball and respect the
6784440	6789800	trackball oh fuck yeah this this game is damn near impossible without a trackball I mean that's just
6789800	6795520	how it is so yeah marble madness but you have to play the level 2 music for me because I just
6795520	6803600	played it like five times yeah but I was talking you had so much to say about the game seriously
6803600	6807840	like my favorite music and are you happy now I'll tell you the other thing I really like about this
6807840	6814000	is that it reminds me of Wendy what's-her-name that did the Tron music oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
6814000	6820920	because I've always loved that synth style just that them since exactly I love it so much so this
6821520	6831240	why can't I remember her last name now Wendy does it start with an O um Wendy Carlos Wendy Carlos
6831240	6840680	okay it's CEO it's an arched letter um yeah it made me think a lot of Wendy Carlos music well
6840680	6844400	I mean it came out two years after Tron so I could definitely see they're being influenced
6844400	6848760	in the music and even that grid style if you notice the colors and some of the levels in
6848760	6855080	that style it I see some Tron influence so all right there it is your classic game of the week
6855080	6860600	marble madness definitely a classic and you can certainly find that in collections like I think
6860600	6866920	that midway game I had on the ps3 for a little bit had that in it but again you know thumbstick
6866920	6873360	versus trackball not the same sorry to say there's another successor that she didn't mention I'm
6873520	6879640	pretty sure I even called into all our about this like five years ago because a buddy of
6879640	6884400	mine had a copy of this and I've never played it since and I really want to called Cora Reimpa
6884400	6894720	marble mania exclusive you play the game I think it was Mario Galaxy or Mario Galaxy 2 when when
6894720	6898880	your character jumps on like a big bowling ball and goes down a track what the game tells you to
6898880	6903320	do is take the wiimote and put the bottom in the palm of your hand and treat it like a you know an
6903320	6910280	arcade stand of joystick kind of thing Cora Reimba uses that control method exactly and I forgot
6910280	6915000	about Cora Reimba risingly fun I actually have that dandy I have that game it is totally a
6915000	6921440	marble madness biting but it's great great I need to play this game again all right well you can if
6921440	6925480	you want it's right I have like a baseball or something like that yeah a lot of different
6925480	6931520	little stuff pickle soccer basketball panda yeah they did and they all like different weight and

6977920	6982840	been a really fun show so far we had Matt Connor on earlier I'm talking about his Kickstarter for
6983600	6989400	read-only memories and gamer acts and that was a really fun interview we were just talking about
6989400	6993320	that during the break how that was a lot of fun and also kind of talking about during the break
6993320	6997760	I know we're getting in one of the stories here it's gonna come up in rapid-fire news but you're
6997760	7001800	also talking a little bit about one of the game did you bring up during the break damn it I had
7001800	7005760	a gym oh yeah Fantasia you were you were saying something about where's that Xbox one game
7005760	7009120	Fantasia that was supposed to be out I was actually wondering that exact same thing the other day I

7025920	7032360	tiles actually got delayed as well no really it well it was a connect sports oh yeah yeah
7032360	7035360	that's right but didn't they get weren't they doing like a demo thing they have a demo thing
7035360	7040840	going on what Nintendo did with the Wii Sports remake but yeah that's been delayed I think it
7040840	7047360	was delayed just because there's a big gap in titles coming out like I said you know after this
7047360	7056760	week you know what week is a couple is a Vita game and a PlayStation 3 title that's been delayed
7056760	7060640	forever painkiller you know what do what dark soccer is doing do one game a week to help get

7110980	7118660	dyad is also gonna be coming to play free as well I haven't died I remember hearing about the game
7118700	7124340	but I don't remember what it is exactly but it's supposed to be good and then I think that was the
7124340	7132580	one that's supposed to be sort of like like geometry Wars maybe I'm trying to look it up
7132580	7139820	real quick because it's one psychedelic racer it sounds familiar to me too it's a tunnel racing
7139820	7144660	puzzle shooting game is what they call it okay well then it's nothing like geometry Wars it
7144660	7149260	sounds cool though I like that description I'll check that out ah then for Vita Sonic and all
7149260	7158620	or Sonic and all-stars racing transform for the Vita and urban trial freestyle pretty awesome so
7158620	7168660	that's coming out and then to be fair I think on the Xbox Friday no it Gears of War is gonna be one
7168660	7174140	of the free games I don't remember the Xbox Live Arcade title that's also with that though
7174140	7187420	but yeah Gears of War one coming and then Saints Row 4 getting some DLC pretty soon actually I
7187420	7194180	think next week or on the 11th and they're gonna have to save Santa Claus from the simulation so
7194180	7200220	how the Saints save Christmas and then we'll come with the course as I predicted a Christmas themed
7200260	7212380	dubstep gun and then a bunch of other you know things reindeer jingle bells jingle so pretty
7212380	7220820	much yeah it's part of the season pass or $6.99 if you wait until December I will have you know
7220820	7226100	though if you do buy the season pass I think right now it's on sale for 66% off it's like
7226100	7233300	five bucks right now or you know on Steam so it might be worth picking up if you're curious I
7233300	7245260	guess okay Jason I got it you ready you ready come they told me pa wub wub wub huh that's good
7245260	7252540	that was good I'm gonna put out an album sort of God wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub
7253260	7262860	and then some great news and definitely coming very soon in December we will see the final
7262860	7269860	PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto game coming to mobile Grand Theft Auto San Andreas getting an
7269860	7277860	improved I believe it like slightly HD version that'll be coming out not sure when but sometime
7277860	7284220	this month supposed to be on iOS and Android and Windows mobile of course limited devices
7284220	7288500	are gonna be able to run it but fuck man San Andreas is like one of the best PlayStation 2
7288500	7294740	era Grand Theft Auto games and that's just all sorts of awesome now I hope that that means now
7294740	7299780	that they have all these sort of HD a fied Grand Theft Auto games that we get some sort of triple
7299780	7306100	pack for like Xbox Live arcade or something like that that would be amazing because it fucking
7306100	7315340	sucks to play those games on using the touchscreen although Grand Theft Auto Vice City in think three
7315340	7320420	did run on the Uya so you may be able to sideload this on the Uya which then you'll have like a
7320420	7330620	PlayStation 2 sort of oh all right moving on some more stories here I know we had a lot of persona
7330620	7335140	news last week because you know they're teasing persona 5 and so forth but who cares about that
7335140	7340220	when there's persona for dancing all night that's right the persona music action game that's the
7340220	7346140	one you're most excited about let's get real it is being developed by Atlas and the co-developer
7346140	7354460	of Hatsune Miku project diva dingo awesome the game will take place after persona for the Ultimax
7354460	7360660	ultra suplex hold and Tetsuya Kimura and Daisuke Asakura and some other musicians will be doing
7360660	7364740	the background music for the game some of the games in the game will include pursuing my true
7364740	7369780	self heaven reach out to the truth time to make history and true story which were all songs that
7369780	7375420	were in persona 4 and persona 4 golden so awesome now the song list is starting to take shape so I
7375420	7380860	know you persona fans and you music game fans are gonna be in heaven with that if you like your
7380860	7388180	classic games like me you're probably excited to hear about this jump man I well ironically one of
7388180	7393100	the games I or the game I did for my very totally because you did that I know right right my first
7393140	7397500	let's remember video we'll get this the game developer apparently resurrecting jump man is
7397500	7405660	located in Wichita where Shane Alinko is mind blown something gaming is happening in Wichita go
7405660	7412260	figure but yeah which I game developers name is Davis sickman jr. now he raised he's raising some
7412260	7418820	money with a Kickstarter to try to revive the jump man games for iPhone iPad Android PC Mac and
7418820	7425140	Ouya so that's pretty cool jump man of course originally created by Randy Glover for the Atari
7425140	7431500	and the old-school PCs and Commodore 64 the initial version had 30 levels and so on and so
7431500	7437980	on so yeah that would be cool there was a jump man resurrection project planned around 2000 when
7437980	7443040	they secured the rights to do sequels but it didn't really come to be I guess there was jump
7443040	7447980	man 2049 but it didn't it didn't really happen but thanks to Kickstarter jump man forever
7447980	7454620	could be a thing nothing ever works out 2049 what if they did a crossover game that was doodle
7454620	7460700	jump man there's there's potential you never know all right you know there's a lot of potential in
7460700	7466100	the awesome game typing of the dead overkill heck yes this game is a lot of fun I played it again
7466100	7473060	with speaking of Shane in Wichita played this online this past week and the one thing we didn't
7473060	7478260	get to do unfortunately was try the brand new DLC that was released this week the Shakespeare DLC
7478260	7485020	pack that's right for $3 you can get all the typing in the game changed to lines as to thine
7485020	7492300	oh self quintessence of dust and bellows mender so you can you can actually type we get the line
7492300	7496620	about the bunghole from Hamlet anything is possible dark soccer you know what a bunghole
7496620	7503980	is right for real no I I have heard it in the Shakespearean context yeah it is the hole on a
7503980	7512220	keg mm-hmm now you know as opposed to the hole on your keg anyway uh-huh that's all I got dark
7512220	7521660	Sakura dang it I was actually looking at the email um well there is a website now open for
7521740	7527300	the Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary so you can go look at it I'm sure you can just hunt it down by
7527300	7534100	going to work you know looking up Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary site but it has some teasing on
7534100	7546860	there too what could it be we don't know moving forward um Atlas is basically free to look at
7546860	7552600	any of Sega's old IPs any of their dormant ones so you know that could be Panzer Dragoon that could
7552600	7562340	be Jet Set Radio that could be Shenmue so who knows or it could just be Streets of Rage by the
7562340	7567620	way there's that silver lining I mentioned earlier yeah Shenmue they should make a spin-off game where
7567620	7577580	the main character is a cow and they call it Shenmue okay so and then now this I actually sat
7577580	7583820	and watch freaking footage from his two hours watching this thing today and this one I'm gonna
7583820	7591140	go ahead and just give the link to this is on shoryuken.com Ultra Street Fighter IV
7591140	7601980	is at Super Arcade in Walnut California and it is basically location testing but there is a two
7601980	7608740	hour just play of some of the different characters that are in it we have T-Hawk we have Rolando we
7608740	7618260	have Elena, Makoto and Poison I was very actually very happily surprised at just how much more
7618260	7625340	balanced some of the gameplay seems in it but you can watch the footage there's link following
7625340	7634740	from shoryuken.com so go look at it all right awesome lots of I would I would think this would
7634740	7638540	be a dead period for gaming news but we still got a lot of good stuff going on out there let's get
7638540	7651140	to the foogle question of the week you take Facebook and you take Google Plus you slam those
7651140	7655660	words together you get boogle and it's our foogle question of the week posted on both our communities
7655660	7660740	over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and our Google Plus community at google.com slash
7660740	7665820	plus orange lounge radio all one word or you know what if you put orange lounge radio on Google
7665820	7671780	you'll find it it comes right up anyway um I'm only gonna be able to read a couple I'm trying to
7671780	7675780	buy us back some time since our interview went long but with great reason it was great interview
7675780	7679620	but I'm gonna try to buy back some time here so I'm not gonna read a lot of answers but I really
7679620	7684060	want to encourage you to read because there were some great answers to this so here it is earlier
7684060	7690340	this week one popular web blog for Apple fans made the claim quote while the previous game console
7690340	7695060	generation was all about motion controls it's clear that the new machines will use second
7695300	7700700	functionality and apps as major weapons of war and that was a quote from the unofficial Apple
7700700	7707460	web blog or tuaw.com now that all the triple-a players are on the field what do you feel was
7707460	7712220	the majority theme of the last generation what might the theme of the next generation be more
7712220	7719560	motion second screens VR AR more 3d and so on and fact you guys may not have known this question
7719560	7723540	today coming from Jason actually invented this question Jason you want to elaborate on this at
7723540	7728860	all before I read some of the answers um just nothing nothing terribly to elaborate on I just
7728860	7733280	don't think that second screen is gonna wind up making any sort of a significant dent I think the
7733280	7738940	apps are getting better and they're going to exist but as far as that being as far as that being this
7738940	7744660	year's motion that's not gonna be nearly all it's cracked up to be all right well let's look at some
7744660	7749100	of the answers again I've really got to abbreviate this tonight please please please go read the
7749100	7753520	responses in focus are some great ones including this one on Google Plus from Colin M who says
7754040	7760480	last-gen felt like the me to generation the we introduced motion controls and Sony was like me
7760480	7765680	too with the six axis Microsoft at least tried something new with the Kinect I think that I just
7765680	7772040	gotta say I really like that answer because I mean for real because I mean I haven't read the second
7772040	7778120	half yet but I was like you know what damn if that ain't right it does feel like everybody was kind
7778120	7782440	of stealing the good ideas from each other not necessarily a bad thing that's just competition
7782440	7790720	but you'd like I I couldn't I couldn't go back to like even the PlayStation one and Sega's you
7790720	7795640	know Saturn Aaron and and talk about like that was a me to generation it really wasn't optical
7795640	7800280	media yeah I mean but that that who a new format which is that's not really above and better of all
7800280	7806320	the cartridges ever that's not me too in the way that that e3 a couple years ago when they debuted
7806320	7810680	the Kinect and the Sony move you're sitting there going wow they're just they're just after
7810680	7815600	Nintendo's weave aren't they so you know is very interesting anyway let me read the rest of Colin's
7815600	7820200	answer here on Google Plus I think the defining feature of this new gen will be social interaction
7820200	7825720	both the Xbox one and PlayStation 4 have activity feeds a la Facebook to show you what your friends
7825720	7830880	are doing even the Wii U has that Plaza of sorts then they're sharing videos of the games and live
7830880	7835400	streaming seamless multiplayer experiences such as watchdogs will blur the line between single
7835400	7841360	player and multiplayer gaming this next gen will be all about other people Jason you made a motion
7841360	7846240	like I agree that sir that's exactly what my prediction for this generation is gonna be is
7846240	7854560	that last year was better graphics denser media mostly and motion controls yes and and except in
7854560	7860440	the case of we mostly cementing the online marketplace and online interactivity there is
7860440	7868920	I have a very strong feeling that this generation also in PC land is going to be not just developing
7868920	7875960	a title updating it and moving on but it's going to be social more socially geared with your friends
7875960	7883080	but also gaming communities do you know how much new Borderlands 2 content that it there is do you
7883080	7889440	know how much new Diablo content there is there's like all of these games are geared with the
7889440	7895760	ability of with the capability of tacking new content on continuously in my opinion micro tracks
7895760	7900680	and microtransactions be damned it's kind of a really good thing because they're going to extend
7900680	7905680	the lives of games and keep changing it in significant ways all right let's go to one more
7905680	7910920	answer from Google Plus from Travis H who says 3d makes my head hurt motion control frustrates
7910920	7915840	me it makes me break a sweat I'm almost positive VR would make me throw up so let's stick to buttons
7915840	7920160	gripping and movie quality storylines and gameplay that pushes the limits of what we have already
7920160	7925840	seen or felt so far as for second screen bring it on I love how well the Vita and ps3 play together
7925840	7930680	can't wait to get my ps4 love my Wii U and the new PlayStation app they added is a great step
7930680	7935680	in the right direction for Sony so instead of mobile's attempt to take over consoles let's
7935680	7942320	make a baby and I'll get along so that is Travis's prediction for you let's make a baby and I'll get
7942320	7947200	along love it those answers from Google Plus but there's about six other answers there if you want
7947200	7955280	to check that out we can call it the X for you going to Facebook let's read some answers here
7955280	7959480	on Facebook you know I I might be being partial here but I really like this answer from extra firm
7959480	7965040	our buddy from courthouse extra over on Facebook says I think smartphone integration is definitely
7965040	7969920	the theme of this console generation whether it's second screen experience or having companion apps
7970000	7974120	for your games I think that's what it's about heck even Nintendo has branched out and made
7974120	7979000	Miiverse available on smartphones I think this is the major companies doing their part to not
7979000	7984620	compete with mobile phones but to show that they can adapt to them let's make a baby right let's
7984620	7990400	read another answer here from Ricardo V who says I don't think the last generation was about motion
7990400	7994960	controls maybe the marketing makes it look that way because it was the new thing but at the end
7994960	8000160	I think it was more about giving a cinematic feel to games lots of scripted events animations of
8000160	8004240	characters with the environment issue played etcetera clear examples of that are games like
8004240	8009840	Uncharted The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite I still don't have a new console but I think we
8009840	8014720	started seeing what the new gen is about in the previous gen integration of indie games into the
8014720	8021600	consoles multitasking and cloud and digital content good answer I like I like that too and
8021600	8027480	certainly even though I think you saw it a little bit with PlayStation 2 just that when you talk
8027480	8031320	about cinematic feel like certainly the budgets are starting to get up there where it's like you
8031320	8035720	are but you're making three movies when you make a video game you know just just with what goes into
8035720	8040880	it so I I definitely think that took off and especially those games you cited there let's do
8040880	8046440	one more answer from Facebook I'm gonna do this one from Andy R who said I think the theme of this
8046440	8051320	generation will be connectivity by that I mean games that might have been mostly single-player
8051360	8056240	games in the past that are now offering incentive to connect to the internet to evolve the game
8056240	8062520	world we saw the beginnings of it with games like Dark Souls or Demon Souls or Journey we're playing
8062520	8067480	the game online could change or enhance the gameplay experience now with games like Watch Dogs
8067480	8073040	or destiny the theme seems to be continuing again those are some of the answers from Facebook and
8073040	8077080	Google Plus please check out all the great diverse answers and it's never too late to add your own
8077080	8081960	as well it's not like we close it down and and we read pretty much everything that's posted at
8081960	8086320	least to ourselves and we like seeing the diverse opinions and see what comes back on the show later
8086320	8090480	that later on we're gonna get back into some long-form news but if you have more thoughts
8090480	8096240	on this topic mailbag at orange laundry comms a great place to send it to Loki I was gonna say
8096240	8100640	also yeah I definitely don't think motion control was I think problem with motion control and this
8100640	8105840	is even gonna be something going into next-gen with connect and stuff is just it's a gimmick
8105840	8114360	it's just like remember when they had the vision camera yeah it's a gimmick that sold more copies
8114360	8119760	of Wii Sports than any other video I'm not saying that we did it wrong we had the right idea because
8119760	8124200	their whole console is based on that in the beginning and you know that was fine and that
8124200	8130960	worked I'm talking about the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 it did not work it was a fad and I
8130960	8135760	honestly think did you just make a pro Nintendo statement versus the other two I've always said
8136480	8142840	just I'm just saying it's just funny anyways um so I think the same to me you said with the second
8142840	8146800	screen stuff is I think it's just a big old gimmick that you know it's definitely something
8146800	8151200	Microsoft's pushing because they want that second screen to be a fucking surface you know so of
8151200	8156720	course they're gonna try to push that or a Windows Phone or some shit I just don't think it's
8156720	8160800	something that we're gonna see implemented well into games you may get a couple games that
8160800	8164760	implement it well but aside from that I mean it's just like what they've done to connect its voice
8164760	8171680	commands for shit or it's FIFA detecting that you're cursing so they can fly you why the fuck
8171680	8180640	would you want that I just don't know why anyone would want that anyways um okay so let's talk a
8180640	8186280	little bit about the Xbox one since I mentioned connect you may remember last week we talked a
8186280	8192080	little bit about how the Xbox one had some issues with some of the consoles that hey there was disk
8192080	8196920	drive sounding like that it was shredding the disk you know at least that's what it sounded like
8196920	8202200	and it was an issue and I said you know they really should come out and address the issue
8202200	8206240	and figure out a way to you know piece customers and so that so that's what they did they went
8206240	8210880	ahead and said you know what they're gonna replace the console what's kind of great about it is if
8210880	8216760	you call in and say hey you know my consoles all fucked up what they're gonna do is give you a free
8216760	8222880	digital version of one the Xbox one launch title so either forza rice in a room dead rising three
8222880	8229560	or zoo tycoon and you get to keep your console until the replacement console arrives and you
8229560	8236120	send the replacement console back so I thought that's a pretty decent way to make up for those
8236120	8241840	drive issues and I haven't heard too much more about it this week so I'm assuming that it was
8241840	8248040	indeed a very small number of consoles that were affected by it well thank God that it's not so
8248040	8253560	widespread because I think that they learned the lesson the last time yeah they think I want to
8253560	8260240	make that mistake again yeah no kidding well this could get very interesting could EA be working on
8260240	8265680	an open-world Star Wars game so what yeah some recent job listings apparently point to this which
8265680	8270320	of course makes me raise an eyebrow and go but I thought they already had a Star Wars MMO called
8270360	8276800	the Old Republic but perhaps something new to tie in with the new games or maybe not even necessarily
8276800	8283320	an MMO but an animation director being hired for EA Canada for quote a major new next-gen
8283320	8288960	open-world action game in a beloved sci-fi property sounds like battle friend to me you
8288960	8293960	maybe hmm there's also an executive producer British position in a lead combat designer
8293960	8299340	position which apparently was also linked to a Star Wars property because a recruiter said
8299380	8305420	something on Twitter I don't know but anyway apparently this goes back to when avalanche
8305420	8311180	studios was working with Lucas are almost signed up with Lucas arts to do an open-world Star Wars
8311180	8318020	game around 2007 oh my god that would have been so amazing and then you guys remember Star Wars 1313
8318020	8322620	that was something that was Disney candidate if you didn't know Disney closed developer that
8322620	8327380	halted the game could that be the game that's being picked up and continued question mark who
8327380	8333100	knows EA of course has the exclusive rights to develop and continue the Star Wars games so I'm
8333100	8339500	sure something will happen by December 2015 when the new Star Wars movie comes out guaranteed you
8339500	8344380	know avalanche is the company behind just cause which may know very exciting and they also have
8344380	8350380	them a new Mad Max game coming out so that oh you very awesome I liked the trailer for that they
8350380	8356580	know how to make a good multiplayer game or new open-world game so it's it's December 2013 now so
8356580	8361780	you got two years to make it happen it sounds like they already got started so we'll see what
8361780	8368100	happens don't make me feel older just think about how old we're gonna be when the new Star Wars movie
8368100	8372700	finally comes out the Warcraft movie you know what is next year huh my 20th high school reunion oh
8372700	8379620	my gosh Wow so are you gonna go if someone gives me $400 for the plane ticket yeah I'm gonna try
8379620	8386740	to my ten-year reunion was practically just downtown where I go all the time didn't go yeah
8386740	8391740	well you're not from another state right I'm not but I'm just saying I just anybody my ten-year
8391740	8396420	reunion was crap I don't think we had one for mine if we did I didn't care most people I want
8396420	8401140	to keep in touch with I'm I still talk to on Facebook it was yeah I actually keep up with
8401140	8406300	those people some of those people now on Facebook and I'm like you have kids I have a cat there
8406580	8411460	would love my cat there is high school was such a bad time in some ways it was good in some ways
8411460	8415780	it's bad I want to make it sound like poor me because we all had bad experiences I'm sure but
8415780	8420940	there's just some people from high school I would really love to go my entire life and just never
8420940	8426140	see again and that would be I would be very happy with that I can sympathize with that I just want
8426140	8433940	to bring Dan and have Dan and then like leave early like I did for homecoming my senior year
8434900	8442220	like bye this place sucks hey don't have a story do you yes you do well how about some wow news is
8442220	8450060	you know we've got oh my god space goats coast to coast I know but I'm not playing it because I
8450060	8456380	promised I wasn't gonna get it but their lead designer sorry the lead system designer Greg
8456380	8462340	Street left Blizzard he said bye I'm gone actually what he said is that and this is a quote I've been
8462380	8466980	at Blizzard Entertainment for almost six years it has been epic and I have made many friends
8466980	8471100	around the world and I've learned so much but I have a great opportunity for something new and
8471100	8477380	exciting sadly it is time to move on he's also going to oculus right now no we don't know there's
8477380	8482500	a lot of now there's a lot of tinfoil I mean being on the Horde house I talked to a lot of
8482500	8487380	Warcraft people there's some tinfoil hats in the community that he possibly went to riot games
8487380	8492860	maker of League of Legends also in LA this is based on a total conspiracy theory about who he
8492860	8499820	follows on Twitter which is interesting um but I but I mean if he quit Warcraft to go to League
8499820	8505340	of Legends he'd just be like everybody else yeah but I'm pumped which is strange blizzards new one
8505340	8511340	is coming now yeah but the funny part is that it's not funny I know all right I just like well you
8511340	8516660	know what people go and you know people moving from company to company usually isn't news but
8516660	8522240	the thing about World of Warcraft man quasi quasi related question to that comment did
8522240	8527020	your conspiracy theories come from people in California or outside of California all over
8527020	8533020	they come from the internet where well it's it's a meaningful question to me because my my
8533020	8538460	co-workers those that have lived in the Bay Area you know the better part of their lives have a
8538460	8544140	lot of friends at a lot of companies either personally or professionally including our
8544140	8550620	competitors and everything else and you know yeah yeah have has competitors I didn't know
8550620	8557580	it kind of thought they did their own thing very much no oh there are the detail is the the depth
8557580	8562540	is infinite it's you know everybody everybody has the this is better this is worse has the
8562540	8569220	confrontational aspect of it and sure that exists at a professional level as well but it's not maybe
8569220	8576420	I shouldn't rip back the veil but it's not like death death threats and and at odds ends with
8576420	8583380	each other I mean we just had a charity dodgeball game where our best friends at competing companies
8583380	8588380	came out for a good cause as well we do whenever we throw drink ups people from all of these
8588380	8595700	companies come out it's not yeah professionally the it's it's competition but that's healthy and
8595700	8601620	the people that make it up are good people you know for the short time that I interned at a
8601620	8607620	local TV news station as I was going to be just like Ron Burgundy one day and here here I am but
8607620	8611580	I interned in a local TV station and they would about once every three months there would be a
8611580	8616980	big get-together of all the local news people from all like NBC CBS all of them would just go
8616980	8622740	have dinner like it's not they all hated each other because a lot of times and especially look
8622740	8627340	at your own local TV news they trade people all the time and people go to jobs to the companies
8627340	8632700	and it just you know something that happens yeah we that this this is industry this is why they're
8632700	8637820	there's conventions professional conventions where all of these same people talk discuss and meet all
8637820	8642900	the rest of these people and it's also why you don't truly have companies that just bicker back
8642900	8647140	and forth in the same industry and are just like at odds ends with people it's I don't know it's
8647140	8652660	interesting it's interesting insight for me to have now as well let's move on with more stories
8652660	8659620	Loki all right so you know one of the first things of course to come out of a tragedy like Sandy
8659620	8667020	Hook was let's blame Pete you know video games because obviously this person had video games
8667020	8672500	played video games clearly video games must have caused it you know because we could also draw that
8672500	8678300	conclusion to food food must cause this because he eats food therefore you know food caused murder
8679260	8686700	anyway so there was a report that was done you know showing all the different games you played
8686700	8695620	and stuff and unfortunately even though you know with that profile everything it just it didn't tie
8695620	8702300	with the games at all it said he played video games often both solo home and online they can
8702300	8708180	be described as both violent and nonviolent one person described the shooter as spending the
8708620	8714220	of his time playing non-violent video games all day with one of his favorites at one point being
8714220	8720420	Super Mario but there you go Super Mario Bros. causes mass murder well there was a let's go I'll
8720420	8725100	let you finish cuz I'm about to drag a bit it's the shadow people that live on top of the cliff
8725100	8731380	and I'm about to drag a bit in conclusion you know what we do know is the shooter had significant
8731380	8735580	mental health issues while now affecting the criminality of the shooters mental state for
8735580	8740900	their crimes or his criminal responsibility for him did affect his ability to live a normal life
8740900	8747780	interact with others whom he should have been close with and you know video games did not play
8747780	8757620	a part in that so yeah and it's funny as even though after that came out of course the NRA
8757620	8764980	issued a statement blaming still are actually no I'm sorry that this is referring back to the the
8764980	8771060	original thing where the NRA blamed it of course no traction on that you know no retraction from
8771060	8778140	the NRA about being wrong or anything as they usually are I was looking at Twitter this week
8778140	8782940	as I usually do during the day and I saw a link and I made the mistake of clicking on it even
8782940	8787980	though I saw the name Kotaku in the URL and my eyes rolled so far to the back of my head I could
8787980	8793660	see my fucking brain because they ran a story about how the Sandy Hook shooter his favorite
8793660	8799100	game was dance dance revolution and this guy played DDR all the time and dah dah dah dah and
8799100	8806860	all I could really think of like I was just like Kotaku please shut the fuck up please please shut
8806860	8811860	up I I saw these links I didn't read the article surely they were making it tongue-in-cheek and
8811860	8817340	making the same point that we are which I'm just sitting here going why are you perpetuating this
8817340	8822860	whole I mean it's it's kind of irresponsible it's clearly clickbait it's clearly this whole
8822860	8827900	let's and I'm not even saying this because I played DDR for years and years because unlike
8827900	8835420	what you do when you run a story like this I don't give this shit any credit at all clearly
8835420	8839740	and even the professionals have now said the video games had nothing to do with it and you
8839740	8845020	know what happened obviously was a huge tragedy let's not forget I mean had just how awful and
8845020	8851500	fucked up what this guy did was people want to blame something for it the unfortunate reality
8851620	8860700	is there may not be anything we can blame but evil mental health there's that too I mean that's I get
8860700	8865500	that speculation you know I mean it's just so with the state of I hate to go into the politics
8865500	8871860	of it you know but we don't give enough attention to mental health I there is no background checks
8871860	8876740	there's definitely a lot of stigma with that and and we we have to break down those walls a lot and
8876740	8883140	I would agree with you there that you know clearly he had issues that weren't being addressed I don't
8883140	8888260	know trying to beat those nine footers might frustrate someone into no I'm serious but yeah
8888260	8897500	so anyway I'm just saying the ban on that website continues and you know shame on me for being dumb
8897500	8903180	enough to click a link like that but I was just like no no they could oh my god every so often
8903300	8907420	you have to confirm that yes they're stupid yeah it's just kind of one of those like Lord get a
8907420	8915420	look anyhow let's see going to our chat room at live dot vog network comm SSJ 100 Matt says
8915420	8925860	basically this report answered no questions let's see a coup the peggle pervert says see how and
8926180	8933980	oh Lord all right uh let's move on more stories and I will go next well you remember also to the
8933980	8940540	people used to blame D&D on making people be devil worshippers yes and Mike when my mom found out I
8940540	8945340	played D&D in high school she like threw a fit because she thought it was devil worship well my
8945340	8949300	grandma did the same thing so when I'd go play D&D at my friend Derek's house I'd be by we're all
8949300	8954740	for our weekly chicken sacrifice Rob right you are not we're seeing them worshipping the devil
8954740	8960500	are you Rob that way you do that's what they said on Oprah Rob Rob do don't play Dungeons & Dragons
8960500	8970300	Rob that's what it was like they said on the 700 Club that watch that shit so I don't even know
8970300	8974620	how they got bored by the way you or when they started caring if I worship did you hear that
8974620	8979780	the guy that started the Trinity Broadcasting Network died no I didn't yeah he died yesterday
8979780	8985100	that Fast and Furious dude too but yeah I was gonna say all I all I heard about on Facebook
8985100	8989340	was the guy from Fast and the Furious yeah but that guy died too and no one cared well because
8989340	8994740	I'm not gonna fit I'm not I'm not even gonna finish my thought or I'm gonna be a bad person
8994740	9002340	so I'm just gonna bite my tongue and talk about the PlayStation 4 hey and well here's the thing
9002340	9007780	about the PlayStation 4 it may not last long hold on hold on I'm not trolling here's the thing there
9007780	9014740	was a comment from Sony UK pop UK boss Fergal Gara because of course the PlayStation just
9014740	9019300	launched in the UK this week there's a lot of stuff in the media over there this week and
9019300	9023900	Fergal Gara made a very interesting comment saying quote I think there's reasons to believe that the
9023900	9029220	next cycle might be shorter in markets such as the UK it's probably a sign of the times and how much
9029220	9032940	has changed in seven years but I think the willingness and the appetite to pick up new
9032940	9037940	technology fast has probably changed quite a bit so all this coming down to will the ps4 be a
9037940	9045100	10-year lifecycle maybe not horseshit please I and this is this is going back to the question
9045100	9050860	of the week and this is a question I've had in my mind for a very long time as far as a new console
9050860	9056820	a new technology a new technology and an overhaul what the hell else are they gonna do the video
9056820	9061300	game the quality the visual aspect and quality of video games has improved dramatically and
9061340	9066980	considering that every you know unless everybody box on 4k and rolls that into a new technology
9066980	9072700	there's no that you know there's no visual dramatic changes that they can make you know in the next
9072700	9078580	five Jason I want to say yes but I when I was 12 years old and saw Super Nintendo mode 7 for the
9078580	9085140	first time I was like it's so fucking real it'll never get more real than that oh my god but so
9085300	9092940	cool but that is a terrible comparison that is fuck you do because no well no the quality
9092940	9099180	standard is cinema slash real life and one step closer to the holodeck Jason that's what we always
9099180	9103860	say on the show every console is one step closer to the but but that would be a different technology
9103860	9107660	that's not just a graphical improvement which is what I'm claiming right now but there's nothing
9107660	9113660	that can take that mantle in the next generation to make the ps4 is timeline a lifecycle be less
9113660	9122060	than for you like or soft lightroom Jason it's gonna holodeck you all listen it the difference
9122060	9129220	would be moving from a you can't I don't really think you can use the holodeck as a graphical
9129220	9132980	comparison because this is what I'm saying one step closer Jamie we're not gonna be at the
9132980	9139780	holodeck the next generation there'll be awesome if we were more apt comparison would be shut up
9139780	9147980	would be leaving your monitor for a holographic interface well that's what they have in the
9147980	9157700	Hunger Games that was the correct reaction the endgame can only be one I didn't break the mic
9157700	9164060	listen the endgame can only be one thing and that's where the boobies become real and you
9164060	9170220	put your penis in it that is really the endgame that anyone can expect because where do you need
9170220	9176580	to go beyond that not nowhere you know everybody is interested in that thank you I understand that
9176580	9182860	but that's gonna be the endgame I want fluffy kitties I want to be able to pet the kitties in
9182860	9188900	the game as do I but I'm just there will be a switch there will be pussy there will there will
9188900	9194220	be a switch just like on the old Atari 2600 game select there will be booby and kitty and then of
9194220	9203620	course you know and ferret mode moving on all right that's the show 100 Matt and chat says
9203620	9209540	one step closer to the edge and it's about to break just like this show we've been one step to
9209540	9215620	the edge since episode three okay and I wasn't even here dark soccer I was I was sleeping in a
9215620	9224940	closet real story damn it you know what Rob pet the pussy she came out for a little bit I was
9224940	9232860	surprised now this is one thing that is super cool if we can get away from the bullshittery
9232860	9242940	of you know fake reporting and all the gun violence and and pussies everybody those two
9242940	9248700	last statements do go well together you have whatever I was trying to tie it in but I'm so
9248700	9253820	flustered right now because of the Cyber Monday event for Rosetta Stone ad that's on this page
9253820	9260420	no seriously um there are a team of neuroscientists at the University of Pennsylvania and Friedberg
9260420	9268180	University that are using video games where people go through virtual towns basically just
9268180	9273100	delivering oh you know they're using fucking Animal Crossing but I mean they're going around
9273100	9277820	and delivering stuff in these in these locations in the game but they're looking at how the brain
9277820	9288500	encodes spatial information to form I guess location tags for memories and basically there's
9288500	9292500	actually a mental technique I don't know if anyone's ever heard of something called the
9292500	9299420	mind palace basically where for you to remember certain information you visualize rooms in a
9299420	9307740	palace and it's mapping it's using spatial mapping to instead trigger a memory and it sounds like
9307740	9315220	that this is sort of what they're doing but they're also using this more as a study for epilepsy which
9315220	9322740	is very interesting they're basically trying to find direct neural evidence that memory that
9322740	9331660	basically memory tags information based on where and when they were formed so that you're you
9331660	9338020	access the memory by remembering that situation and I know for me in particular and I know I
9338020	9344980	haven't been like overly verbal on this but at the end of January I was diagnosed with autism
9344980	9353620	in like not I'm gonna go repeat myself a bajillion times and kill people no that doesn't happen the
9353620	9360540	whole thing too is that it's actually been how I remember a lot of stuff is by remembering visually
9360540	9367300	what where I was what I did I couldn't remember the name of this one shop for the record until I
9367300	9371540	was standing at IKEA facing the direction that the shop was in and then I remembered the name of it
9371540	9380180	for example you know so it's it's definitely got a bit of a definite interest I mean we're talking
9380180	9387420	about that mind palace technique having been a mental memory building tool that's been in
9387420	9396500	existence since before the the current era it's been in existence for centuries for thousands of
9396500	9402980	years so the fact that they're putting using a video game to actually test how the brain maps
9402980	9408500	this information and using this technique in a visual manner is I think it's a pretty neat
9408500	9416260	thing honestly so nice yeah games doing good I appreciate a story like that after the fuckery
9416260	9421220	we had a couple stories ago there's another thing too that they were I'm just gonna read this
9421220	9426180	because it is kind of technical but I'm gonna quote it because it says during navigation neurons
9426260	9431700	in the hippocampus and neighboring regions can often represent the patient's virtual location
9431700	9436900	within the town kind of like a brain GPS device these so-called place cells are perhaps the most
9436900	9442100	striking example of the neuron that encodes an abstract cognitive representation so basically
9442100	9446980	where they're visualizing themselves in their game environment is where their mind is visualizing the
9446980	9454580	data that they're researching too so again it's there's a tie between how we think what we remember
9455060	9458740	and how we access our memories I think it's fantastic that they're doing this and hi scenario
9459860	9464740	kitty no she's in the living room she's getting a little more friendly during the show it's good
9464740	9468980	all right uh anyhow let's move on uh dark sakura is going to open up the mail bag
9470100	9474900	mailbag at orange laundry.com is the place to send emails and I think it was a little bit lonely in
9474900	9479460	there this week but at least there was one right yeah and I think though that some no there was
9479460	9486740	only one uh so I'll read it um hello oh lorry ease um I have a fairly decent income and the
9486740	9492340	purchase of both systems really hit my savings hard I can see why most everyone will only get
9492340	9497780	one of either the ps4 or the xbox one I think they're both solid and with good games but I'd
9497780	9502420	like the games on the xbox xbox went a little better I think I can sum up my comparison of
9502420	9506980	the systems with an analogy the playstation is like someone handing out candy to everyone in
9506980	9511300	the form of a roll of mentos the xbox is like someone grabbing handfuls of candy and throwing
9511300	9519140	them into a crowd um enjoy and remember to brush your teeth robaba yes sir I'll brush my teeth I
9519140	9525140	love robaba I I wish I could have been in the situation where I could buy both consoles this
9525140	9529860	year if I wasn't in debt after my last Disneyland trip I would I'd like to be in the position where
9529860	9537860	I can just go to Disneyland soon soon yeah all right uh mailbag at orange laundry.com if you
9537860	9542740	want to make some crazy analogies on the show in the future it'd be awesome mailbag at orange
9542740	9549860	laundry.com uh now is the part of the show where we get a little bit angry even though you know
9549860	9555380	there's been a lot of happy stuff tonight uh we have to balance that with some anger and rar
9555380	9557140	because FUs of the week
9572980	9579780	I am actually not very angry today except for I mean the usual stuff
9580660	9584340	so yeah I guess I'm pretty angry not really I'm angry on behalf of Becky
9584900	9589700	I'm very glad that I did not get hired where she is employed at and I cannot go into
9590260	9596180	more detail because I was advised of a lot in confidence but um fuck that place fuck it a lot
9598260	9606580	um oh and also fuck bitch face Vicky who was my ex-boss who sold the company to the current place
9606580	9611940	for um and I heard about this so I again not something I can prove and just nail her ass to
9611940	9616660	the wall about but for apparently bad mouthing me to the current owner of the company because
9616660	9620580	she couldn't handle she thinks I was trying to ruin her business you know what if I was trying
9620580	9624580	to ruin your business it would have been gone before you sold it you didn't change your
9624580	9630900	passwords duh all right lucky I figured you're out for not playing Grand Theft Auto 5 yet
9631620	9635700	it's only $39.99 amazon really on ps3
9638980	9642260	FU to Loki for trying to get me to spend more money when I already spent
9642260	9646100	too much on goddamn steam sales but at least all the steam games are really good
9646100	9651540	I can't be too upset uh Jason I was going to say that I'm happy little bunny this
9651540	9657140	week and that's mostly true but uh amusingly and perhaps not at all surprisingly enough
9657140	9664660	to last week's FU uh I'm having a weird snafu with the uh the parking garage that I'm in right
9664660	9673460	now and people are being very silly and blaming me for something I'm sure they there's a dresser
9673460	9677780	something at the end of my parking spot and people are telling me to move the extra three inches in
9678420	9685300	that dresser is not ours it's not part of our unit so um I need to figure out whose it is so
9685300	9690740	I can actually pull in the whole way to the parking lot all right which you know San Francisco
9690740	9695140	type parking you can understand how being even that much further away from your normal spot
9695140	9702900	would be detrimental admittedly parking in San Francisco oh my god terror terror yes all right
9702900	9710340	FU to terror uh just a couple more stories for you guys Loki speaking of terror Lindsey Lohan
9711220	9722020	what segue of the year goes to Lindsey Lohan is now allegedly uh suing Rockstar Games over GTA V
9722020	9728740	because there is you know the whole game takes place in uh like a Hollywood environment there's
9728740	9735460	you know different celebrities and stuff that you run into and you know they act very cliche
9735460	9740820	like some of these celebrities might but she thinks that one of those characters is directly
9740820	9750660	based off of her good luck with that because um no no don't we have like laws for parody and
9750660	9755620	especially if you're a parody public figure not a character that's just exactly her it's it's all
9755620	9763060	of the different you know female celebrities that are on the flip side how much do we actually
9763060	9766660	believe that Lindsey Lohan would be suing a freaking video game I mean really
9769620	9773780	and besides that parody is protected I just want to make sure this news is coming from Kotaku is it
9774900	9778500	because it sounds like the type of story they'd write I don't know if it's better or worse
9780180	9789220	never mind it's coming from TMZ oh god oh god well it's just probably why everyone doubted the
9789300	9795060	it's about the same level death reporting yesterday too yeah yeah so all right well
9795060	9802340	if TMZ reported it Loki it must be true so yes she's claiming that I love that I'm gonna direct
9802340	9807700	quote this because of their wording uh claiming that video game honchos jacked her image without
9807700	9816820	her permission who uses honcho anymore apparently uh somebody does some some TMZ staffer
9817620	9825380	well whatever to that good luck Lindsey Lohan and yeah TMZ you're both gonna need it all right uh
9825380	9829460	also good luck to all of you that were awaiting this new console this actually sounded really
9829460	9833300	awesome and I was looking forward to this I was hoping to maybe pick one up at some point but
9833300	9839300	it's gonna have to wait till next year because the retron 5 console or the retro N I think retron's
9839300	9843940	better name but retro N or whatever the retro N5 console has been delayed to the first quarter of
9843940	9848820	2014 if you did not know what this was this was the this was the system that would play
9848820	9855620	Game Boy Advance games Super Nintendo games Genesis games NES games and Famicom games all
9855620	9860740	in one hence the number five and it had like an HDMI out so it would make it work on newer TVs
9860740	9867860	that's uh pretty awesome and uh it's been delayed because of faulty pins discovered in some packaged
9867860	9872580	units at least they're doing the right thing and pulling it and fixing the problem as opposed to
9872580	9877460	selling some crap units so unfortunately if you were hoping to get one on its release day December
9877460	9885220	10th too bad you won't all right uh there it is that's it for the news we had uh in our show
9885220	9888500	roll tonight but we are going to open up the Skyblind we're actually kind of on schedule too

9993860	9997780	but just take rob's balls and throw them at everyone to be fair they're not actually my

10009460	10015540	with your balls hopefully she'll hear it on the podcast feed well it's a good thing they're not

10044580	10049620	yeah have balls anyhow I'm sure you didn't call in just to talk about balls what is on your mind
10049620	10057860	that's what you sorry how do you know I didn't call well surprise me then let's let's let's talk
10057860	10065460	balls no no no did not come to talk balls couple things I want to talk about from tonight's uh
10065460	10072180	discussion sure now I understand that olr is the place where every person has their voice
10072180	10079060	now in response to that one person who wrote in about how you guys are being biased towards one
10079060	10088260	console yes shit happens these shit happens yeah I mean on our podcast we talk about different
10088260	10094100	things but sometimes we get on one topic or one company for a while and it's like well that's what
10094100	10099780	everybody is talking about just because we're talking about it as well that does not mean what
10099780	10105700	we're saying is the same as everybody else right and I do want to I do want to remind you it wasn't
10105700	10113300	just one person I only read one thing on the air yeah and one thing is that everyone gets to turn
10113300	10120260	in the barrel so for that point for a while it was xbox one's turn to be in the barrel that's
10120260	10125700	that's how that's how the news goes yeah I think I think that's very true um the same thing happens
10125700	10131220	in politics right you know sometimes it's the the red team or sometimes it's the blue team or
10131220	10137140	sometimes it's it's all of them honestly so um you know it just just kind of depends on on what
10137140	10143300	the public eye is person is watching yes like for example when heroes of cosplay was on tv
10144340	10149220	all the blogs all the podcasts that's what everybody was talking about was heroes of cosplay
10149220	10154900	and then we're talking about it but we're like yeah we watch it only because I'm drinking when
10154900	10159780	I'm watching it and I'm giving my personal spin on it so it's a lot more entertaining as comparing to
10159860	10164100	what everybody else is saying about the show yeah I saw that there was some uh because you know
10164100	10167700	everything's got to have an internet petition these days there's some internet petition going
10167700	10173620	around to uh make it fairly represent cosplay and I was kind of like well then it wouldn't
10173620	10178020	really be I mean it's tv right it's it's and it funny enough I don't know if you heard the
10178020	10181380	interview with Matt but we were joking at the end there about his time on the uh America's
10181380	10186740	worst driver and you know it was it was just tv it was tv show all right the fact that you brought
10186740	10191380	up there as a petition I wanted to put my headset down and just start falling over laughter because
10192420	10198580	how well you try to put a personal a positive spin on cosplay as soon as it hits tv it's nothing
10198580	10202740	but drama drama drama drama drama and people are complaining about how it's gonna wreck the
10202740	10206500	community no you just brought everybody together I'm sure you know what if somebody did a reality
10206500	10213140	show about orange lounge radio there'd be oh my god the shit talking right like that because
10213140	10217620	that's what tv does and that's that's what would happen even though you know what we all we all get
10217620	10222260	along mostly when it when it comes to no for real we all get along great when it comes to you know
10222260	10226740	time to do the show the run for president do we do we have our disagreements behind the scenes
10226740	10230900	sure once in a while but they're disagreements among friends don't if you don't shut up what
10230900	10236500	are you talking about you don't know shit I'm totally judging you it no in all seriousness like
10236500	10243060	any argument we have behind the scenes is like like I think if any friendship goes forever with
10243060	10249700	no disagreements it's like that's that's almost boring yeah that sounds right also on the same
10249700	10254500	token when you're arguing it kind of brings the friendship stronger because you got from points
10254500	10259380	of view that you bring it to the table yeah and then when you're tired of arguing you look at
10259380	10264980	Jamie like you want a drink let's have a drink that's right that's right I had seven last night
10265780	10272420	any problem can be solved with liberal amounts of booze uh so you know what I I like that as a um
10272420	10278500	great response to you know just just the the people that felt a little bit like um uh that
10278500	10282900	maybe maybe picked on in their fandom or whatever from last week's show is just like you know hey
10282900	10289140	let's let's let's fight it out then have some drinks exactly and Rob even though you can't
10289140	10294260	you said you're like the only gay nerd in your town I feel you I was the only I felt like I was
10294260	10299460	the only black nerd in my town I'm like I'm the only one that's renting anime is it just me or
10300180	10304980	you know it's definitely not just you I know I figured that out like about a couple of years
10304980	10311300	later I'm like I find another guy I'm pointing I'm like I'm not the only one I feel so I don't
10311300	10316500	I feel better about myself now right right it's it's awesome yeah I know I know and now I now I
10316500	10320900	feel so silly it's like oh I know tons of gay nerds it's awesome but like in the past it was
10320900	10325060	always like god I feel so alone and I don't know anything about fashion and I'm gonna be you know

10396340	10400980	lounge radio who's this hey what's up guys this is Kai Judo hey Kai Judo what's on your mind buddy
10401700	10405620	and uh you know you always say this is the show where every gamer has a voice and um I just want
10405700	10412340	to voice my opinion on this whole uh supposed console war do it um yeah me okay it can it can
10412340	10417780	be said that I'm more on the side of playstation 4 like I'll admit that like right away but it's
10417780	10422980	not so much where it's you know for me it's not really Sony versus Microsoft it's really their
10422980	10427780	policies that really pissed me off I feel that um you know I've been gaming for a long time I mean
10427780	10433700	since the early 80s I've been gaming and I just see a trend happening that I don't like in gaming
10433700	10438180	which you know I'm actually prevents me from playing a lot of games these days just for the
10438180	10442500	simple fact that a lot of stuff is becoming I call it pay as you play with all this micro
10442500	10448260	transaction shit uh Microsoft is pushing that um all this crap about you know where uh you know
10448260	10453620	where you can lend your games and who you can lend it to the crappy uh the the freaking codes
10453620	10458260	that they give you so that uh you know you can't sell your game at a game stop not that I do that
10458260	10464260	like usually I like to just buy games brand new anyway online pass but um yeah yeah I just hate
10464260	10470420	the fact that like it seems like you know um you know if you're the type of person where you trade
10470420	10473860	your games or you might not have internet access or whatever it just seems like they're like
10473860	10477860	cutting those people out like I'm like there's still people out there that don't have all these
10477860	10482180	luxuries you know and like for you you know for you to just cut those people out like it really
10482180	10486500	just rubs me the wrong way so like I've been like anti-microsoft for the longest time now I mean
10486580	10490500	having even checked into xbox live and I don't know how many days I think well since this past
10490500	10495220	summer you know so like you know I'm doing like my own type of little uh boycott that you could
10495220	10500260	call it again certain not you know not just Microsoft but I mean a lot of the different
10500260	10504820	game developers and companies that they do things that I don't necessarily agree with like I mean
10504820	10508660	the list is huge I mean there's so many things that's going on right now let me let me ask let
10508660	10512980	me ask this question because you know because the the online pass thing thankfully we're seeing that
10513060	10518260	go away in a major way most of the companies that enacted it which to be fair Sony was one of them
10518260	10523620	with their first party games most of them that enacted the the online pass have since sunsetted
10523620	10528180	it I think there's only a couple stragglers out there and to Microsoft's credit they they never
10528180	10533860	enacted the online pass on their first party games now we would have all raked them over the coals
10533860	10538180	if they had because they were already charging a fee for xbox live so that you know that's neither
10538180	10543780	here nor there but I guess my point I'm trying to make with this is when a when a company comes
10543780	10548500	out and says you know what we were wrong we made the wrong decision which I think Microsoft kind
10548500	10556500	of did since e3 is that is that not is that not what you want or what what is it what can the
10556500	10564500	gaming companies do to win your fandom back uh just I mean you know just pretty much I would say
10565380	10572260	as far as as far as when it comes to lending your lending your games out trading your games
10572260	10576740	you know like I said people like to go into game stop and sell them whatever as far as that type of
10576740	10582100	stuff goes don't you know don't try to put all these policies to get extra money out of people
10582100	10587140	that do that like let let people do do what they've been doing for years don't interfere
10587140	10592900	with that sell your game for 59.99 as once the person buys it you know that that that should be
10593620	10598900	your income right there you shouldn't charge people again to trade something in or whatever
10598900	10603860	the other crap that you're doing out there let let me buy my shit and own my shit when I pay 60
10603860	10608900	bucks for your game I own that game right and especially with um like I said with these micro
10608900	10614420	transactions I mean everybody everybody everybody's pretty much getting their hands dirty into
10614420	10618660	something like um even steam I would even go out to steam and say that a few things that they're
10618660	10622900	doing I don't necessarily agree with this um I don't know if you guys are aware of this but
10622900	10627860	they have this new thing now where it's um the early access have you guys seen this yes I have
10627860	10633460	in fact I I actually have a game with early access yeah yeah I bought into that too I actually have
10633460	10636980	two games that are early access that you know they pretty much I mean from what I can see they
10636980	10642180	look like they're like completed games but when you look at it you're like what the hell is going
10642180	10647940	on now like we're actually paying now for it incomplete games like like these are like alpha
10647940	10651940	games these are not even they're not even in beta you know a little minecraft you know what's
10651940	10655380	interesting though about that kaijuto is I think kickstarter showed that there was a market for
10655380	10662260	that yeah true so it's it's it it is weird it's weird to think that we are in that place with
10662260	10667380	gaming but I think a lot of it and I've expressed this before and I think it's important to note
10667380	10672260	let's not forget Microsoft realized they made a mistake there and they're they're trying to
10672260	10676340	correct it for better or for worse I think that's important to note but as far as like the steam
10676340	10680660	stuff goes and I remember saying this back when we all thought that this was the way Microsoft
10680660	10685460	was going to go before they reversed I sort of said you know what I think it really depends how
10685460	10689860	much they're going to charge for a game and I still kind of stand by that because I would have
10689860	10694660	been totally fine with Microsoft's new policies if they were only charging 20 30 bucks for the game
10694660	10699060	was that what was going to bring the price down from the 60 limit which let's be real is still a
10699060	10706260	little high one of the perks of steam and one of the reasons why people use steam steam sale and
10706260	10713380	being able to buy games for literally a dollar I bought dlc quest for a dollar and so it's kind of
10713380	10718020	one of those all right so it's a digital copy and I'll never be able to sell it back it cost me a
10718020	10725300	dollar and I'm like totally okay with that yeah I just finished um getting all the dlc that I needed
10725380	10730660	for Skyrim and also picking up Morrowind on steam so you know I like I like steam for that but I
10730660	10736980	mean um like I said it just it just looks like it to me I just don't like the uh the direction
10736980	10742500	that things seem to be going in the the reason why I'm so anti-microsoft is just for the simple fact
10742500	10748740	that inside me even though I'm pretty sure that um you know I'm the little man here it may never
10748740	10753940	be effective but for me it's like I feel okay Microsoft is kind of leading this charge if I
10753940	10762580	could find some way to uh to you know not not really to uh not really to uh um not really to
10762580	10767700	make uh to make people go my way or see things my way but if I could find some way to just uh
10768660	10773060	pretty much let them know that you know we don't agree with this or whatever you know maybe they'll
10773060	10778100	start to uh change the policies like they did with the uh you know with the uh xbox one how they
10778100	10783140	reverted everything back yeah I'm just hoping that and more people hop on that and more people get on
10783140	10787380	Microsoft and all the other people that are doing this type of you know these types of things then
10787380	10792180	maybe we'll be able to uh get some balance you know I just want some balance in the um in the
10792180	10796820	gaming world doesn't seem like it's that it just seems like pretty soon they're just gonna you know
10796820	10801700	they're just gonna walk all over the little man and there isn't much that can be done unless unless
10801700	10806100	us as gamers you know we start with all this console war crap and we see things for what they
10806100	10810100	are you know we tell them hey you know we don't like we don't like microtransactions or you know
10810100	10814580	maybe you can fix it you know stuff like that let me let me get this out let me get this out
10814580	10817620	before we let you go because I think this is important to say because you know there's going
10817620	10821460	to be people sitting at home or in the office listening to this podcast right now that is
10821460	10827380	thinking this guy is crazy this guy needs to let it go this guy has too much hatred for easily you
10827380	10831300	know there's people sitting there thinking that right oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I come across
10831300	10835380	it all the time sure yeah but I think there's a good comment in the chat room that kind of plays
10835380	10838660	into both sides of this here and I think I think this is important this is from Chris109 in the
10838660	10843620	chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying yeah but the damage has been done and it takes time for
10843620	10848900	the wound to heal and I think in a way whether you personally listening to the show think
10848900	10853380	Kaijuto is overreacting or not I can certainly think you know I've gone to a place and I've
10853380	10858020	got bad service or a company did something to really irritate me and it was a while before I
10858020	10865060	tried that company again you know what I mean but I did go back at some point and either I learned
10865060	10869060	why I stopped doing it in the first place or I was like all right things are better things have
10869060	10873700	changed you know I'm happier now do you think Kaijuto that maybe that's what's going to happen
10873700	10879060	is that if Microsoft is a little more transparent in some of these policies and kind of gets that
10879060	10883940	community that they've lost that that tapped into the community if they can get some of that back
10883940	10891460	that maybe we can heal these wounds well you know me me personally I'm not you know don't don't get
10891460	10896900	me wrong like me I've already made my decision I mean my my boycott is gonna stick I mean that
10896900	10902260	you know I have to do what I have to do for myself basically like for me you know I don't want to
10902260	10906180	live in that type of gaming world so the games that I choose to purchase the companies that
10906180	10911060	choose to invest in they don't do any of that right now you know so that's what I'm doing
10911060	10916980	for myself you know like like I said I'm not out here to try and make people see things my way but
10916980	10922660	I just want people to be aware that you know the gaming world as it is now is uh it's pretty
10922660	10927300	screwed up and uh I'm just saying that people need to be aware of that stop with the console
10927300	10932500	world stuff it's not about xbox versus uh playstation 3 for some of us out there for
10932500	10937540	some of us it's more about hey you know don't you know don't cut the little man out you know
10937540	10941780	you know you know remember where gaming or you know remember what gaming was about originally
10941780	10945300	you know it was originally about fun I mean of course you have companies who you know they got
10945300	10949620	to make money you know everybody says it all the time but I mean it was always fun you know
10949620	10952500	trading with your you know trading with your friends and all this stuff and now it's just
10952500	10958340	becoming way way too political and way too like out of hand all this crap so that's what I'm
10958340	10961540	saying all right well I think you make a good point at the end of the day is it's just you
10961540	10965700	know what play play play the games because there's a lot of good stuff out there right now so right
10965700	10969300	cuz you know thank you for the call and for the perspective that could be challenging for some

11282660	11290180	hear us just a little bit what's up buddy um well I wanted to give uh or make a somewhat serious
11290180	11299220	call uh you know this week you know don't make serious calls all right well um now all you have
11299220	11305780	you know I always have heard uh the topic is I was dealing with my cat at the time but uh
11306740	11312420	I believe you know but you I believe like the three of you or well whoever you were talking
11312420	11320980	about uh no someone linking again linking mental illness in video games to violence and uh
11322660	11330420	yes you know you know and now I'm gonna open up here a little bit and talk about something
11330420	11339460	that I generally don't talk about okay I'm mentally ill myself uh and you know I was
11339460	11348580	back in 1998 I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder
11349940	11360180	which is also known as PTSD also known as shell shock okay uh and as a result of between those
11360180	11371620	two diagnoses I generally have a hard time regulating emotions and sometimes my behavior
11372500	11379540	as a result can be a little bit off you know it can be construed as odd or unusual uh
11380420	11388660	to someone they may not have to deal with mental illness now that being said just because someone's
11388660	11395700	mentally ill you know regardless of whether they play video games or not that does not mean
11395700	11404420	they're gonna go Norman Bates on someone's ass no nor go Texas Chainsaw Massacre on someone
11404420	11410340	no one said they did well I think I don't think we did but I think the media sometimes gives that
11410740	11419300	well you know I'm just saying that's what the general you know that's what the general uh
11420020	11425700	perception is in society is that if someone someone has mental illness that's that's what
11425700	11429460	we talk about when we talk about the stigma of mental health that's that's what's out there and
11429460	11433380	thank you for opening up about that Raginator that's that's brave of you to say on the show
11433380	11439060	and I'm going to say this the reality is there's there's a lot of people like you out there and
11439060	11445060	it's funny even though I'm talking about earlier in the show I feel like the only gay nerd I bet
11445060	11449860	you're not the only nerd pardon pardon me but you you must be a bit of a nerd if you listen to the
11449860	11453380	show you're probably you're probably by far not the only nerd that suffers from the types of
11453380	11458420	conditions that you're that you're talking about that you that you just brought up and um you know
11458420	11463140	I think I think mental illness is much more common than sometimes the media and the mass perception
11463780	11471060	often gives it credit for but there's also so many variant uh varieties and for example some people
11471060	11477300	who have certain disorders don't consider it to be a mental illness for example yeah I may be
11477300	11484020	autistic I don't consider myself mentally ill you know yeah if I had well and it in a way and just
11484020	11488180	just to kind of you know because because like people get sick not mental illness but physical
11488180	11495380	illness is a person with diabetes necessarily considered themselves sick not I mean they're
11495380	11500660	managing you know I mean that's kind of what what happened right am I there's a difference because
11500660	11506580	well I mean that the better comparison and I'm not and just I am not belittling diabetes by any
11506580	11511300	mean my grandma had it and suffered from it and so forth but I'm just saying you start to kind of
11511300	11517540	you know treat it and it doesn't like it doesn't you you conduct your day-to-day life managing it
11517540	11523860	the difference would be in autism and type 1 diabetes would be closer to each other
11523860	11529940	PTSD and type 2 diabetes would be closer to each other as a comparison because something happened
11529940	11537700	that caused this it's an onset right whereas me I was born this way right so um that being said
11537700	11541780	I think what they're not also considering is that some of these people who have gone back
11542420	11552980	um were had much more severe forms of socio uh disorders had there wasn't one of them
11552980	11558260	actually diagnosed schizophrenic which means they hallucinate schizophrenic is not multiple
11558260	11564020	personality disorder there are two different things some people have complete reactions
11564020	11572260	based on trauma I know people with PTSD and I'm talking about like the uh the post-war variety
11572260	11580580	you know who you a car backfires and they're running for cover right you know that's the
11580580	11585620	type of person I would not want with a gun for example that's somebody who I wouldn't want to
11585620	11591780	have access to weapons because I've seen that instant look for panic look for defense you know
11591780	11597700	sometimes there is that but when you're you know but the average person dealing with depression or
11597700	11602340	dealing with just that you also I just want to be careful with the broad generalizations because
11602340	11608420	you also would not be the one to say who and who shouldn't exactly a professional does this not you
11608420	11612020	exactly but but my point what real quick raising you're sorry I'll let her finish the region here
11612020	11616900	we'll get back to you my point on that was saying that is that if a person is going to have a
11616900	11625060	tendency to go into a defensive mode or to go into some sort of a memory regression
11626020	11631380	you want to watch you know but you don't know who everybody is that's why there has to be better
11631380	11636100	screening that was my point sorry no no worries rage nator go ahead and get your thought out and
11636100	11642580	then I have a question for you now also one thing to consider is you know you know regardless of
11643380	11652020	what you know diagnosis that someone has be a ptsd or schizophrenia or this or other you know
11652020	11659380	some questions that should be asked is are they in some form of treatment are they seeking one-on-one
11659380	11663940	counseling are they seeing psychiatrists getting medications are they taking their
11664580	11671220	medications as prescribed you know and it's usually taking up this pill or this pill
11671860	11677940	at the right you know levels you know dosages every day consistently at the right time
11678820	11687380	so and so forth and I mean you know if they're not you know they're not seeking you know treatments
11687380	11694420	uh not taking their medications as prescribed if they're abusing street drugs or alcohol
11695300	11701540	then yeah their their behavior is going to get far far worse and plus if
11702500	11708980	they and if you also you know one thing to consider is on top of that
11709780	11717060	ninth or more often than not the mentally ill is the the victim of crimes you know
11717060	11726020	relative to perpetrator if you know you know if let's say uh hydrasically speaking I don't know
11727300	11733140	you know you're Sacramento at all so I don't know what areas of town are the good
11733140	11738180	side sites of town where aren't where the homeless tend to be so and so forth but
11739060	11746580	if you can think of what area area that the homeless and the mentally ill tend to congregate
11746660	11752100	and you happen to be on the street up to no good chances are you're gonna probably
11753780	11757940	if you want an easy mark you're gonna probably go after the people that
11758580	11765620	won't put out much of a fight which probably will be the mentally ill you know so you know
11765620	11772340	what's new great well yeah you'll hear about the guy with schizophrenia that first some woman off
11772340	11778420	of a training platform that woman gets killed but there are the exceptions to the rule not
11778420	11786420	the world itself you know right and chances are there that person that can't take their medication
11786420	11795700	or you know was doing wasn't alcohol alcohol drugs a few hours earlier or multiple whatever so
11795700	11800020	rage nator let me let me ask you this and and and then we we will unfortunately I mean we can
11800020	11802740	make a whole show out of this topic but we do have to wrap up for the night but rage nator let
11802740	11806900	me ask you this because because you did share with us some pretty private information about
11806900	11811940	your life and so forth and there is that stigma out there that you know video games are bad and
11811940	11817860	video games make you uh want to do bad things how do you think rage nator maybe you don't have an
11817860	11822820	answer for this but I want to try and ask it anyway uh rage nator how do you think video games
11822820	11833220	help you uh well in the times that I stressed out you know or depressed you know let's say I'm
11833220	11842180	feeling uh severe depression you know depression symptoms or there's some kind of stimulus outside
11842180	11852020	that's really educating me one way or another uh and I use my video games as my primary
11853380	11864020	coping uh coping mechanism to deal with uh the symptoms uh like uh at least prior to my ps3
11864020	11873060	being uh stolen I would either play flower or super stardust hd and now obviously flower is
11873060	11883460	a very relaxing game yeah very much or but regardless of the game now I'll focus in on that
11883460	11890500	game for a while and for all intents and purposes while playing the game the rest of the world
11890500	11898500	and my own thoughts no don't exist I just focusing on completing the level with being the level being
11898500	11909780	the ai doing whatever and after a while uh things go back to normal and I use air quotes uh well
11909780	11919860	normal for me right now sure sure and you know what's a great well that doesn't work 100 percent
11919860	11926340	of time once a great well is so bad that I do need to be hospitalized case in point uh
11927300	11934740	February 12th uh second of last year I did have to go to hospital for the suicide attempt but
11934740	11944580	sorry to hear that but generally speaking the video games do work no no they help me focus in
11944580	11954820	something else besides the the symptoms so well thank you for um sharing some very deeply personal
11954900	11959140	stuff with us um but you know again to tie it back to something I was talking about at the
11959140	11963540	beginning of the show sometimes it's about getting outside that bubble and there might be people out
11963540	11968420	there that like don't kind of realize it and so maybe now they're thinking about it because you
11968420	11973140	you said something about it here on the show so I really appreciate you opening up and uh how dare
11973140	11976740	I suggest that you aren't capable of making a serious call because it was a very serious call
11976740	11981460	thank you for that perspective don't I feel like a jackass definitely thank you though but I mean
11981460	11986580	and this is one thing that I think everybody has a responsibility to do and that's educate yourself
11987460	11991300	and people don't often think about educating themselves on something that's outside their
11991300	11996580	comfort level their comfort zone walk walk a mile in somebody else's shoes because at least at the
11996580	12001620	end of the day if nothing else you you have their shoes you have their shoes and you're a mile away
12001620	12006980	all right yeah but but that was you know thank thank you for giving some incentive for education
12006980	12012500	as well appreciate it sure all right rage nader I gotta I gotta end it up and end up the show
12012500	12016180	thank you but thank you buddy have a good one sure no problem have a nice night all right you
12016180	12022660	too uh props to rage nader says act deaf in our chat room there we go all right uh whoo
12023860	12028660	and to think I almost didn't take that call because we were on our way out of here but now
12028660	12032820	we are definitely on our fingers we're hovering over the altar just by time I know I was like
12032820	12036340	am I gonna take it am I gonna take all right we're gonna take it so and it was a really really um
12036340	12040980	insightful call heavy stuff on tonight's show my god we covered a lot of good stuff tonight
12040980	12045140	it was a this is a damn good show this was what this was one for the emmys I have I don't know
12045140	12050500	if they give emmys to podcast but if they did I'd be submitting this one I have one last fun silly
12050500	12054340	thing okay good good please has anybody ever actually made it to the bottom of the steam
12054340	12058500	cell page yeah and you've seen the fact that it's upside down yeah you notice the fact that it says
12058500	12063620	spring yeah yeah no instead of autumn and if you actually use that navigation your experience will
12063620	12068100	be temporarily upside down as well on on some pages not all you go all the way to the bottom
12068100	12073460	you hit featured items you get the featured item pages where autumn is on bottom and everything is
12073460	12077860	upside down you scroll to the top spring sale is oriented right side up incredibly silly but
12077860	12082980	hilarious and I figure most people just scroll down until they see a game as soon as the game
12082980	12087300	stopped being listed by yeah I'll have multi-button didn't get steam card didn't care
12088260	12093620	exactly all right uh well and then for Australia since they're all upside down and it's spring
12093620	12100340	there that's that's a joke it's a joke our our chat system at work we have a plug-in for it so
12100340	12107460	anybody that's low even visiting anybody that's uh located as in the southern hemisphere that we
12107460	12112500	rotate their avatars upside down that's amazing I love it it's called the Aussies plug-in all right
12112580	12116260	uh Jason since you do have the mic I want to thank you for being here on the show yet again

12119860	12125860	uh it's great to have you here and um I I guess I'll ask you if you have any final thoughts
12125860	12131940	before we see you next week I'll be continuing to say this because we're not even here yet but

12161780	12167140	chicken mcnuggets all week long this is why you're back it's like when taco bell was giving away the
12167140	12174020	ps4 uh I did like and oh and never mind uh I have a couple final thoughts here real quick and uh
12174020	12178180	one uh it looks like it looks like some of you chatters are having a spirited debate right now
12178180	12181460	so don't don't forget like rama and I were talking about earlier go have a drink at the end of the
12181460	12189380	day I know you will uh and then my other final thought is um I neglected to plug this earlier
12189380	12193860	in the show uh during because I was I was trying to speed along with everything else uh but I do
12193860	12196740	want to mention it's kind of an additional housekeeping thing and I'll remind you guys at
