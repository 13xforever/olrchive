7
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,244
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you playing right now?

8
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:20,668
[SPEAKER_09]: You're playing... Me Plaza, so I can get puzzle pieces since a certain somebody who also has this puzzle completed came in.

9
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:21,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Those puzzles.

10
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:22,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

11
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,912
[SPEAKER_04]: That is kind of like my little crack addiction on the 3DS.

12
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:31,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I'm not playing a 3DS game or whatever, I like to do the little street passing, collecting the puzzles.

13
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:34,718
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's really great for that now is Starbucks.

14
00:01:34,898 --> 00:01:35,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

15
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:37,620
[SPEAKER_09]: I go to at least three different Starbucks a week now.

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get like six people at a time now.

17
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I'm going to steal Alan.

18
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:41,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

19
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:49,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, by the way, just since it's not video, Alan brought some wine in for our celebratory last episode of the year.

20
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:49,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alan.

21
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:51,785
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see Alan in Part B a little later.

22
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Jam Jar is not bad.

23
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:54,739
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, okay.

24
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,741
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not as sweet as Frivolo.

25
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:58,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, listeners.

26
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:00,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this is not great radio, but I have wine.

27
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:01,282
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having wine tasting.

28
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:01,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having wine.

29
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:02,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I am too.

30
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:04,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to sip you here on the wine.

31
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I have wine and coffee.

32
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:08,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that combination.

33
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:12,548
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, but anyway, while we sip away here on some wine, why don't we say hello via Skype?

34
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:14,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Loki, everybody.

35
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:15,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

36
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:16,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Loki, how you doing?

37
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:19,531
[SPEAKER_12]: I was doing good.

38
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:21,199
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:50,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

41
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:52,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

42
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:20,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.

43
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:21,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't blame you.

44
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, have you played any of the 30 games that you've actually bought?

45
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I have.

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was your favorite out of what you played so far?

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,041
[SPEAKER_12]: The Stanley Parable was pretty good.

48
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:32,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

49
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:36,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, did you get the two special endings?

50
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:39,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you go visit the other places?

51
00:03:41,484 --> 00:04:09,615
[SPEAKER_12]: um yeah I got that ending I've got all the endings I think don't spoil y'all I'm about I think four away from beating from all of them but you also get really random ones too so yeah um well Loki the sale is through January 3rd are you gonna try to restrain yourself now or is it still open season you're gonna buy a bunch of stuff well here's the thing I'm right now things to actually buy I really want that's the thing

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, just as said in our chat room just now, because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

[SPEAKER_04]: And Fifth Dream in chat says, new sale is up, Loki, get crackin'.

[SPEAKER_09]: And for anyone who's interested, I'm opening Normandy.

[SPEAKER_04]: And that's your Animal Crossing town, right?

57
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:35,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Has Duke Nukem gone up yet?

58
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:39,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it up for a vote, but I haven't seen it actually on sale yet.

59
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:40,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really want it on sale.

60
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,421
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was part of one of the flash sales, but I don't remember.

61
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:47,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been one of the ones I missed.

62
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:51,001
[SPEAKER_04]: If so, I'm going to be really irked because that's one of the games I wanted to get.

63
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:55,302
[SPEAKER_04]: But Loki, thank you again for the $20 gift card you got me for the holidays.

64
00:04:56,002 --> 00:05:00,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I used that to buy a bunch of trading cards and level myself up to $20.

65
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:06,584
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I crafted that badge for the snow season or whatever, the snow winter sale badge.

66
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:09,285
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got an item in there that I sold for like $0.75.

67
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:11,665
[SPEAKER_04]: So that paid for like five of the cards right there.

68
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:37,707
[SPEAKER_04]: so yeah the items i got were crap so i ended up just selling all of them because it was like oh hey a football manager background yeah totally awesome hey some addicting crap though all that stuff but uh yeah i got some good i've got some good stuff on steam so i'll talk a little more about that later oh i'm looking uh it looks like the flash sale right now stanley parable funny enough you guys talk about that and bioshock infinite which i'm going to talk about a little later because i finally played it this week

69
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:39,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to play that.

70
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:46,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but before we get to that talk, we also have to introduce here with us in studio, say hello to the voice of the show, joining us over the season.

71
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:51,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's been about three months now, or will be by the time you're... Sure feels like it.

72
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:53,036
[SPEAKER_04]: But we love having you here.

73
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:58,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we've always kind of been three people, it's fun to mix things up a little while, and you do great, and you have a great voice.

74
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,521
[SPEAKER_04]: So we always love having here in the studio Jason, everybody.

75
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's me.

76
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:02,582
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

77
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:06,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still in a bit of a rush, and I'm trying to get my heart rate back down.

78
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:10,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason literally walked through the door as we were playing the opening song tonight.

79
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,952
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, maybe a little bit before.

80
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:14,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's your excuse, young man?

81
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:16,016
[SPEAKER_04]: You were in the Bay Area.

82
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:17,458
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your excuse, young man?

83
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,760
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a curfew of 6 p.m.

84
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,421
[SPEAKER_04]: and you got here at 6.02.

85
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:25,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ever be a co-host on Horde House because you will get emails like that.

86
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:41,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a Raiders game versus Broncos in my defense I went to a Raiders game with a co-worker of mine and despite leaving early traffic and everything else I just I timed it perfectly well actually all things considered

87
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:46,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So you did make it here, but I'm sorry you had to suffer through watching the Raiders play.

88
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:48,399
[SPEAKER_02]: That's unfortunate.

89
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:54,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually my first ever game that I've been to in a stadium, football-wise.

90
00:06:56,206 --> 00:07:00,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the Mile High Stadium as a kid, but for a concert, a teenager.

91
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:06,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think I've ever seen a football game, high school, college, anything in a venue before.

92
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:08,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was nice to see.

93
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:13,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good reminder to find out how hectic things are, especially in the Bay Area.

94
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:13,920
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

95
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,800
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really interesting.

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,521
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good being able to get out there and do that again.

97
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,902
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't get shot or shot at?

98
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:20,464
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them, definitely not.

99
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:26,408
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one, well, there's a lot of bangs in the arena, but I don't think it was somebody firing a gun.

100
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

101
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:32,348
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf says, Jason's excuse is identical to mine.

102
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:32,688
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

103
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Football.

104
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:37,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he plays in the football drum line in Atlanta, so, uh, exciting stuff.

105
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:39,377
[SPEAKER_04]: He says he did this show tonight in his uniform.

106
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:40,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how last minute it was.

107
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:42,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, why don't you have a webcam, Bobby?

108
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:43,102
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be hilarious.

109
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:47,044
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you and I have seen our share of high school football games.

110
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:48,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, yes, me and the band.

111
00:07:48,325 --> 00:07:55,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to an Alabama-Auburn game, which anyone from Alabama, any part of the South will know how big the college football thing is.

112
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:56,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I fell asleep.

113
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so bored.

114
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:07,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, going to the chat room as well, live.vognetwork.com Mako asking some questions about Duke Nukem saying, wait, Duke Nukem forever?

115
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:08,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you nuts?

116
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:12,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to clarify, Duke Nukem 3D.

117
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:17,275
[SPEAKER_04]: If I said forever, then I obviously overly misspoke and what a faux pas.

118
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke Nukem 3D is what I'm waiting for.

119
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:23,518
[SPEAKER_09]: That was also my very first convention land game.

120
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:24,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

121
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:27,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Was Duke Nukem 3D when you could do the voice macros and everything.

122
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,540
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.

123
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I've told this story on the show before, but we used to play that in the college dorms, like, over the dial-up.

124
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:35,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, all those little rooms, I mean, dorm rooms are tiny, right?

125
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:37,144
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'd all have our own phone number.

126
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:45,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would play in my room, and then my best friend who lived next door to me would play Duke Nukem in his room, and we would call each other over the phone and do that.

127
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:52,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bros in the dorm loved it, because they would, like, see where I'm at, and then, like, go run and tell him where I'm at, and then they'd run it over.

128
00:08:52,872 --> 00:08:54,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about screen lookers.

129
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:55,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, that's just straight-up shit.

130
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:57,334
[SPEAKER_04]: What a bunch of gossipy bitches.

131
00:08:57,374 --> 00:09:00,635
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think brosy straight guys can be gossipy bitches?

132
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:06,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Get Call of Duty in the mix and we all understand that.

133
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,479
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense, but offense.

134
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I played... Man, what were my early dial-up days?

135
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:14,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a lot of Warcraft 2.

136
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:19,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I played Shadow Warrior once or twice with a friend of mine.

137
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:21,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we had to have played Duke Nukem.

138
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:22,406
[SPEAKER_02]: They're...

139
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Some game of its ilk at the time.

140
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:28,069
[SPEAKER_02]: There was definitely another first-person shooter I played a couple times.

141
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,310
[SPEAKER_02]: For the life of me, I can't remember what it was.

142
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:31,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Duke Nukem.

143
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:36,294
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in the chat room reminding us, I got Duke Nukem 3D when Good Old Games gave it away.

144
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:39,116
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless Good Old Games for giving that away.

145
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:42,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got that too, so I'm very thankful about that.

146
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:50,363
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I also want it on Steam, but I want to get it on sale when it's only like three bucks, is because they have that multiplayer coming, which, you know, the Good Old Games one is great, but

147
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,947
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're trying to add to it for the Steam one, so that's what I'm trying to get in on.

148
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:56,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, clue me in on this.

149
00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:02,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Has Duke Nukem multiplayer on PC not been a thing at all yet?

150
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:07,258
[SPEAKER_02]: In, of course, the modern remakes, DOSBox emulation, that kind of stuff.

151
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you should still be able to land it.

152
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, Loki, do you know?

153
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:14,985
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not easy.

154
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:16,094
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not easy.

155
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:17,495
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not what he used to be.

156
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:17,935
[SPEAKER_12]: I think.

157
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:18,575
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know.

158
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:19,516
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't messed with it.

159
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:22,078
[SPEAKER_09]: This dream says Duke Nukem Gossipy Bitches Edition.

160
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:29,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was going to say that I played a Duke match not long ago, but now that I think about it, that was probably on Xbox 360 after I picked that up.

161
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:30,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

162
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:30,664
[SPEAKER_02]: That was on.

163
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:44,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I guess games of those time were built for like IPX and NetBIOS and all of this other ridiculous out-of-date nonsense that predates, you know, LAN parties in the stable way that they are now.

164
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:46,892
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

165
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:04,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a bit of a slow news week.

166
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:10,569
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a pretty major holiday happen this past week and things that people are celebrating, a lot of people traveling.

167
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was not a lot of gaming news this week.

168
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:19,937
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to what there is in a moment, but this is the time of year where a lot of people talk about what was your top games of the year.

169
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:24,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to start that same conversation here at Orange Lounge Radio, the top video games of 2013.

170
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:29,546
[SPEAKER_04]: But a very important difference, what we're trying to do here, here at Orange Lounge Radio, we want to talk about

171
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:44,893
[SPEAKER_04]: our or as the case may be your favorite games of 2013 meaning there are no right or wrong answers we're not trying to say this is the list and shut the hell up we'll do that later in list list because that is where we do the scientific list and the way things are

172
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:48,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But for this, this is just about, hey, these were my favorite.

173
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:50,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's no right or wrong answers.

174
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:53,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to know, like, what were your favorite games of the year?

175
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:56,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatters, if you want to play along, shout them out in the chat room.

176
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Your one, two, and three.

177
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,281
[SPEAKER_04]: What were your top three games of 2013?

178
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:03,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, guys, they didn't have to be released in 2013.

179
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:09,566
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be any time if it was something you really got into this year because it made 2013 for you.

180
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:09,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

181
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:14,869
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

182
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Fractal, Make Blooms Not War Fractal, Make Blooms Not War

183
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:56,619
[SPEAKER_04]: That is actually a game I got into a little bit when you sent that to me.

184
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I did play a pretty good amount of time one night.

185
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really kind of different puzzle.

186
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,880
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of the old school games of life that were on the Commodore 64.

187
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not talking about the board game version with the wheel and the car with the pegs.

188
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:15,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about like this dot will survive if surrounded by other dots, but not too many.

189
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:18,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just see these really very pretty patterns that bloom from that.

190
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:20,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was almost like that idea, like as a puzzler.

191
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:21,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

192
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:21,923
[SPEAKER_04]: was really cool.

193
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:24,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, especially with the ambient music that plays in the background.

194
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:30,765
[SPEAKER_09]: It's... I'm trying to think of the right way to phrase it.

195
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's it.

196
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:37,306
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is actually from 2010, believe it or not.

197
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:44,867
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was offered as parts of bundles in 2012 and 2013, so it kind of came to more prevalence later.

198
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:47,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you what, I have a different game that did come out this year.

199
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:49,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's Legend of Zelda Late Between Worlds.

200
00:13:50,048 --> 00:13:50,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay.

201
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:52,189
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

202
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:08,657
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, but it still makes me motion sick.

203
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:09,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't use it that often.

204
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:18,084
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually very disorienting, especially when you're... I love the switch in perspective when you jump from a higher plane to a lower plane.

205
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:21,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the camera actually moves with you just a little bit.

206
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:25,669
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, I've been completely enjoying it.

207
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:27,511
[SPEAKER_09]: That game is definitely on my list.

208
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

209
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:29,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

210
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:31,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I want to stick with stuff that came out this year.

211
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:32,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

212
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

213
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:36,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's your number three pick?

214
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:43,641
[SPEAKER_12]: My number three pick is going to be probably... It's kind of a toss-up.

215
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,223
[SPEAKER_12]: It almost sounds like a three-way tie for number three.

216
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:48,404
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a time to talk about honorable mentions later.

217
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:50,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so let's see.

218
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:57,370
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll probably do... I was going to go by how long I played games, but let's do Saints Row 4.

219
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:57,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

220
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because it was...

221
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:06,617
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Saints Row, but it was a little bit of a disappointment just because it seemed like it was kind of rushed.

222
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,438
[SPEAKER_12]: But I still enjoyed it.

223
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:18,102
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just frustrating that I know it, having played all of the entire series, I know how good it could be.

224
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:24,945
[SPEAKER_12]: It's disappointing to see that it didn't quite make it there, mainly to where Saints Row 2 and 3 would have been.

225
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:29,607
[SPEAKER_12]: It had potential, so hopefully the next Saints Row that comes out will be much better, but

226
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:30,944
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still pretty good.

227
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:32,285
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

228
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:36,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And you did talk an awful lot about that game, all the good and the bad.

229
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,852
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't surprise me at all that that is in your top three.

230
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:42,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, I don't know if you were wanting to do this tonight.

231
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:45,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you tend to play a lot more of the phone games, the classics.

232
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:47,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have three games from this year?

233
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:55,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, based off going, like the only way I can really gauge it is going based off the kind of things that I've been talking about a lot, and I think I've come up with a 1, 2, and 3.

234
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:56,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

235
00:15:56,548 --> 00:16:09,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So, number 3, I'm going to give to FTL, Faster Than Light, because I've not had, like, despite how much I complain about that game, if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be playing it.

236
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, it's not particularly puzzly.

237
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:35,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of Twitch action because it's overriding theme more than anything else is management of individuals because the pathfinding, yeah, whatever, the attacking isn't exactly... You can drill down and make things a little bit more difficult and a little bit more complicated and directed, but it's just a good...

238
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:38,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to call it a godsend.

239
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:47,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to pin down, but it's just a satisfying, nearly mindless, but not if you don't want it to be kind of adventure game.

240
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:49,678
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I need to check this game out.

241
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:53,439
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of those games I've always been meaning to check out, especially because it's sort of like a roguelike.

242
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,101
[SPEAKER_04]: But just to be clear, this game was released in September of 2012.

243
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it really doesn't matter.

244
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:03,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, like how many games, and you know, it's so funny.

245
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was it on Twitter posted their top 10?

246
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:08,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Who does Twisted Metal?

247
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:09,166
[SPEAKER_04]: David Jaffe?

248
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:09,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that his name?

249
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:11,728
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy does Twisted Metal.

250
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:12,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

251
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:13,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's him.

252
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:15,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how to pronounce his last name.

253
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:24,156
[SPEAKER_04]: He posted his top 10 of the year, and Sonic Racing, the one that came out last year technically, the one with Danica Packard and all that.

254
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:30,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic All-Stars Adventure Racing, whatever was in his list, and everybody was like, you idiot, that came out in 2012, boo.

255
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,122
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like, okay, but there's so many games.

256
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,984
[SPEAKER_04]: How big is your backlog, people?

257
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:39,286
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still games like Stanley Parable I just said, I need to get around to playing that still.

258
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played less than 25% of my Steam library.

259
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:43,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

260
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:47,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Effect, I did not discover my love for until like four years after the fact.

261
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:48,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, these things happen.

262
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:50,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make very clear.

263
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not trying to come up with like some journalistic, this is the best of the best.

264
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no.

265
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,631
[SPEAKER_04]: These are our gaming years.

266
00:17:57,651 --> 00:18:00,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And FTL definitely ranked up there quite quick.

267
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:01,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played in a couple of weeks.

268
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:02,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to change that.

269
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,213
[SPEAKER_04]: When we get that tweet that's like, why did Jason put a 2012 game on his list?

270
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:06,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ballistic.

271
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:07,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say, weren't you listening?

272
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,014
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

273
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:09,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to all the other words.

274
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:10,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

275
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:14,636
[SPEAKER_04]: But you do remind me I need to check that one out as old as the game may be getting at this point.

276
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:15,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still quite fun.

277
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:16,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Very fun.

278
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:16,657
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

279
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:17,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Very fun.

280
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:18,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess just me's left, right?

281
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:19,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

282
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:19,798
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three pick.

283
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:25,240
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three pick is Super Mario 3D World on the Wii U, which is...

284
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:29,685
[SPEAKER_04]: God, the Mario games are damn near always rock solid games.

285
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:42,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a reason why people eat up anything with Mario in the title because especially when it's the main series games, the platformer games, they are almost always, without fail, some of the best games to come out for the year.

286
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,762
[SPEAKER_04]: A few exceptions here and there.

287
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:47,725
[SPEAKER_04]: but Mario 3D World is by no means an exception.

288
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,226
[SPEAKER_04]: It is one of the best of the year.

289
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:57,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not know how a 3D game was going to go over on the Wii U because it's not in 3D but they made it work out very well.

290
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:04,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the return of the classic styles of Princess Peach and Luigi and so forth from Super Mario 2.

291
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the level design is fantastic and especially later on it just gets better

292
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:11,364
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

293
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:36,708
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

294
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:08,023
[SPEAKER_09]: because that game sort of snuck up on me and I'll tell you how I heard about it.

295
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:10,064
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually through a parody.

296
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:15,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really a parody, but it was a response to an email that the game creator had about it.

297
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:23,868
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he had the narrator narrate the response and the letter about this guy being a major douchebag who emailed about it.

298
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:26,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, why did you say Stanley so many times?

299
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:28,454
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

300
00:20:55,911 --> 00:21:00,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I just sort of, you know, try to do stuff now to spite the narrator and it's so fun.

301
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:03,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Stanley Parable gets my number two.

302
00:21:03,953 --> 00:21:15,776
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have like a little sarcastic antagonist slash protagonist slash do I root for this bad guy or not type character like you had in Portal for sure, I notice you tend to love those types as a lot of people do.

303
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: So that doesn't surprise me at all.

304
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:21,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I like games that are mockeries of other things.

305
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:27,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big fan of satire, and it seems to me that a great deal... I mean, well, hello, I like Homestuck.

306
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:34,005
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, I like anything that is both a satire and homage to a genre.

307
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:41,669
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been having a good time with The Stanley Parable, and I think that it's something that if you haven't played yet, you definitely need to play it.

308
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:47,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in our chatroom saying, playing the Stanley Parable makes me kind of anxious, but it's so good.

309
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:48,228
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is good.

310
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,188
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a great game.

311
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:56,990
[SPEAKER_09]: And that, and I just want to send a message to, we should get the narrator from the Stanley Parable to do a bumper for us.

312
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,011
[SPEAKER_04]: If they would, I would love that.

313
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:01,651
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be amazing for the VOG Network.

314
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:04,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Zones Radio asked me to do a bumper, and I said, well, sure.

315
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:07,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent, excellent.

316
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:08,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's up next?

317
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,394
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Loki?

318
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's your number two pick?

319
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:13,545
[SPEAKER_12]: My number two is going to be Bioshock Infinite.

320
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:23,632
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a great game and had a lot of moments in it where it was just very awe-inspiring, I guess.

321
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:29,196
[SPEAKER_12]: And the ending was very satisfying, I guess.

322
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,598
[SPEAKER_12]: So definitely Bioshock Infinite for number two.

323
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:34,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I like games that have moments.

324
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,222
[SPEAKER_12]: The very beginning, you don't even have to wait that long.

325
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:41,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Within the first two minutes, it's just like,

326
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoa, that's pretty powerful.

327
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I didn't want to get into my gaming week too much.

328
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:52,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to save this for a little later, but I will say I did finally jump in and play Bioshock Infinite for the first time this week.

329
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:57,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I was lucky enough to get it as a gift on Steam, and I was like, all right, it's about freaking time I finally play this game.

330
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:03,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was blown away by the graphics.

331
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:05,275
[SPEAKER_04]: They are so good.

332
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:11,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And the atmosphere of the Columbia is fantastic.

333
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, I played the first Bioshock, and I was like, oh, this is...

334
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:23,409
[SPEAKER_04]: This is alright, and I see why people are into it, you know, the more the story unfolded and so forth, but this one just, not to be crass, but it had me by the balls from the very beginning.

335
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:39,381
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so good, and the way the environment is and all the things to look at and the story behind it, like, DarkSakura, I think if you could handle the first-person shooter, I mean, it's unfortunate, you know, you have the sickness, but I think you'd be really into this, too, because there's so much of the lore.

336
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:40,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have the sickness.

337
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:42,764
[SPEAKER_04]: The lore and the culture with it is just...

338
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:44,784
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know I want to play it.

339
00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:45,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I have it.

340
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:47,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had it for a while.

341
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:49,585
[SPEAKER_09]: So I definitely want to.

342
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:53,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... There's some very uncomfortable things.

343
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:56,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of you guys have probably heard about the controversies in the game and so forth.

344
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,807
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some very uncomfortable things in there about America's history.

345
00:23:58,827 --> 00:23:59,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Alabama.

346
00:23:59,267 --> 00:23:59,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I can deal with it.

347
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:12,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but it's done in a very tasteful way for a story that pushes it forward without it being shocking, if that makes sense.

348
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It is shocking.

349
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,753
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed really realistic to me.

350
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:26,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you've ever looked at any photos from America's history, or even not just America, but other places in the world, it's something that it's very period specific.

351
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:49,627
[SPEAKER_04]: so unfortunately it didn't make my top three probably because I got into it too late in the year but it would definitely be one of my honorable mentions of a late add to my list but anyway Loki not to derail what you were saying but it's just I I had to get that out there that I played it this week and I was just I was I was so in love with it it's it's great okay all right I know do you have anything to add Loki

352
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,003
[SPEAKER_04]: All the DLC was this year

353
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:24,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's actually what I'm basing this off of is that I made a point a couple of episodes ago back when the PS4 was coming out or just after the Xbox One was out, one of the two, close enough together.

354
00:25:24,686 --> 00:25:42,721
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, one of the things that's been really interesting to me is that because online is ubiquitous everywhere, we are truly starting to see video game communities in the video game and not, you know, like fan forums and that kind of stuff that has a very serious disconnect from the game.

355
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:48,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep wanting to say Bioshock because we were going on and on about that and I want to play that too.

356
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:55,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Borderlands is multiplayer and has a lot of work put into it to make sure that the experience of playing together is good.

357
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:05,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention the randomness of the loot and the DLC and the keys that Shift gives out and everything else that's going into that game.

358
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,081
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of video game communities but Borderlands 2...

359
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:19,874
[SPEAKER_02]: is the first one that I know of that's console specific that's putting in a lot of work into maintaining original content and the health of that community at large.

360
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:20,738
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lich King

361
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:45,929
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

362
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:46,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Close.

363
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:49,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn is my number two pick for Game of the Year.

364
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 was one of the most awful MMOs ever made.

365
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:56,992
[SPEAKER_04]: That is no secret.

366
00:26:57,573 --> 00:27:04,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fact that they were able to bring in a new producer who has worked utter magic with this because not only was he able to take...

367
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:06,536
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

368
00:27:24,238 --> 00:27:30,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Back the car into the spot, so to speak, of, oh, but we've got to make sure 1.0 kind of continues into this.

369
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And the things that everybody started at 1.0 have to carry over.

370
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a miracle in gaming that they did with that game.

371
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:38,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It is gorgeous to look at.

372
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:39,808
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun to play.

373
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:44,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is probably going to be one of the best MMOs of this decade.

374
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:48,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you think about it, I mean, World of Warcraft, still have a great love for that community.

375
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,315
[SPEAKER_04]: All love that game.

376
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:55,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I canceled my account this week, I'm sorry to say, because I've been paying for two MMOs.

377
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV, Rome Reborn is where it's at for me right now, and WoW is an eight-year-old game.

378
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:01,227
[SPEAKER_02]: End of an era.

379
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:02,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Running on that engine.

380
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:03,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It is in a way.

381
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:08,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even think the new expansion is going to be enough to make me want to go back.

382
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:36,507
[SPEAKER_04]: it's one of those I'll check it out but we'll see and it's just you know I'm so excited about like a lot of the stuff that's going on in A Realm Reborn right now especially with the latest patch and so forth it's just like I think it is kind of the end of an era just as and to be fair before the angry blizzard mob comes at me with their pitchforks and torches just as I when I left Final Fantasy 11 to go to World of Warcraft that was the end of an era you know this is what's next the pendulum has swung and now we're on the other side

383
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I mention the soundtrack is so flippin' good?

384
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:43,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you get tired of listening to the Chocobo music the whole time.

385
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:56,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have actually been playing Final Fantasy XIV right before this very show tonight, and I was running a Titan Kill, which those of you that have played the game know you have to kill the... I'm not even talking about the level 35 one, I'm talking about the one... See, that's the one I'm on right now.

386
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:57,626
[SPEAKER_04]: The one at level 50?

387
00:28:58,186 --> 00:28:58,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

388
00:28:59,187 --> 00:29:00,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, look up a YouTube of the fight.

389
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:01,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

390
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:03,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And the music is like this rock song that's like...

391
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:29,628
[SPEAKER_04]: that's like death metal that plays in the background and it's like your heart is beating so fast like I know Alan could probably hear me from the other room like every time I got hit with something I shouldn't have it's like fuck motherfucker piece of shit god damn you know it's just like I have Tourette's or something sitting there playing this game but I'm just like that into it and I was playing with a fun group of people uh funny enough um uh Darlena who's one of the hosts over on all games of um

392
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:31,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to mess up the name of this show.

393
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:32,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so embarrassed.

394
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:39,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Kat and Fox, I think she's one of the hosts of that show, I was playing with in a group, and we were having a lot of fun.

395
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And I helped one of their friends get a Titan weapon, or Relic plus one, so that was good.

396
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:53,853
[SPEAKER_12]: That was actually fun with Final Fantasy XI was changing up the music because you could kind of mod it a little bit and add your own tracks and where different songs were.

397
00:29:54,073 --> 00:29:58,014
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had Otherworld from Final Fantasy X as my fight...

398
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

399
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:18,929
[SPEAKER_04]: SSU100 Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, You kept wondering what would be the WoW killer for many years.

400
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you feel that Final Fantasy XIV killed it or did WoW kill itself?

401
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think WoW is dead by a long shot.

402
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:27,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they hemorrhaging subscribers in a way?

403
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:27,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

404
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,313
[SPEAKER_04]: But are they still the biggest MMO four times over?

405
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:31,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

406
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:33,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's still a great community over there.

407
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:35,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be finally tired of the game.

408
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:39,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that regard, yes, WoW is killing itself because it's not...

409
00:30:39,736 --> 00:30:41,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not innovating fast enough.

410
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:19,210
[SPEAKER_04]: and I know Blizzard has a reputation of it will get out there when it's done and when we rush things something like what happened with Diablo 3 will happen and I understand that but you look at something like Hearthstone as well Hearthstone is a great game it is moving too slow why is that game still in beta?

411
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:19,790
[SPEAKER_04]: why?

412
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:44,471
[SPEAKER_04]: are they they're still balancing things really it is moving too slow it is time to open up that beta and just just open launch the damn game is it if you have to still balance some cards is it really that big of an issue because most MMOs out there still need fixing but I mean it's not I think the game's in fine enough shape and it's not even just MMOs Blizzard's entire catalog is balanced once every month basically

413
00:31:44,651 --> 00:32:12,576
[SPEAKER_04]: and this may just be the difference that 10 years makes or whatever where that whole mantra for Blizzard where it's like oh we'll just take time until it's right I'm not saying don't take the time to get it right but I'm saying move a little faster you guys I'm sorry it's just that's the reality they're not moving fast enough I don't think anything's changed in that regard I think they still can take their time because they have three solid IPs that are not they're by no means close to danger

414
00:32:12,856 --> 00:32:15,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fair point, because does it work for Diablo?

415
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:16,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

416
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:16,777
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft?

417
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:17,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

418
00:32:17,177 --> 00:32:17,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearthstone?

419
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:17,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

420
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:21,178
[SPEAKER_02]: A game where you're asking... I actually wasn't counting Hearthstone.

421
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,219
[SPEAKER_02]: You said it yourself.

422
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:23,239
[SPEAKER_02]: WoW is still strong.

423
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,360
[SPEAKER_02]: But between WoW, Diablo, and StarCraft, they are very healthy right now.

424
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strong, but it is losing steam.

425
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:33,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And the difference there is you are asking people to pay a monthly fee for World of Warcraft.

426
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:38,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like... And not only that, but then you nickel and dime them with the server changes, which...

427
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:41,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

428
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:42,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV does it too.

429
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:44,067
[SPEAKER_04]: They make their money or whatever.

430
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:48,511
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just think it's moving too slow.

431
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:51,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you want me to pay for eight months while I wait for an expansion?

432
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:54,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Like no, I'll quit and then maybe if the expansion is good I'll come back at that point.

433
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the reality.

434
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,420
[SPEAKER_02]: By which you mean you will come back for at least a month to find out.

435
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.

436
00:33:00,401 --> 00:33:01,301
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

437
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:01,942
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

438
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:05,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, moving on.

439
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:06,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to number one.

440
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:07,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one!

441
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:09,034
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, numero uno.

442
00:33:09,814 --> 00:33:13,815
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your number one pick for game of the year.

443
00:33:14,595 --> 00:33:15,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Animal Crossing.

444
00:33:16,936 --> 00:33:18,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I not surprised?

445
00:33:18,716 --> 00:33:21,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played this game, like, addictive.

446
00:33:21,797 --> 00:33:22,537
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so crazy.

447
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:25,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I have friends that play with me.

448
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:26,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Actdeft.

449
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:29,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

450
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:59,306
[SPEAKER_09]: and I was thinking about it too that, you know, I've been using it to help Julian with his reading and to bribe him into paying attention to other people but it's got appeal for all ages.

451
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:01,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I really have been enjoying my game.

452
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:04,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I also may have finished my wine before you did.

453
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:06,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Like all of it.

454
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,931
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really good.

455
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:10,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, wine!

456
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your number one pick of the year

457
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,718
[SPEAKER_12]: We wouldn't want you to die.

458
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:42,842
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, it is going to be Grand Theft Auto V. Of course!

459
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:43,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course!

460
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:45,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, what else would it be?

461
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:48,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, it is a great game and I love it.

462
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:51,935
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're still making it better.

463
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:53,297
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

464
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:55,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Grand Theft Auto V. Not a surprise.

465
00:34:55,802 --> 00:35:02,664
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to know more about why Loki picked Grand Theft Auto V as his game of the year, just go back to the previous 15 episodes of the show or so since the game came out.

466
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:05,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I was going to say exactly the same thing.

467
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,005
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

468
00:35:06,665 --> 00:35:09,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, you're number uno, number one.

469
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:16,148
[SPEAKER_02]: If for no other reason than because of the last two weeks, definitely, certainly, completely Rogue Legacy.

470
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:22,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been having, especially with a controller now, like it was always a fun game on the keyboard.

471
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:47,786
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just kind of live for that adventure, random, twitch, roguelike, platformer just all things together, the music and everything else I've been having so much fun with that game throw in a controller, I've been using the PS4 controller religiously like every day since I've started, since I got it and actually got it to work it's been insane amounts of fun and I'm thinking that when it's out on...

472
00:35:49,227 --> 00:36:10,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking when it's out on two systems that I don't have and one system back home that I'll get back to eventually, those being the PS Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, I may buy it again because just to have the console experience from the ground up, not to mention there's some very, very frustrating Mac bugs with Rogue Legacy, but besides the point...

473
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:41,777
[SPEAKER_02]: more specifically I've had a conversation with a friend or two in the last couple of days I kind of want to get a Vita for a number of reasons and that's basically Playstation 1 classics and some of the newer games being able to play them portably just seems like a worthy investment and that's always what it is for me with consoles rather with portables is that when I can play something anywhere I love to be able to do so and Rogue Legacy may tip me into that purchase and so for that very reason that's my number one pick

474
00:36:43,178 --> 00:36:47,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure did.

475
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:48,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great pick.

476
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:49,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

477
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:56,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I was listening to the show on the way up here, of course, and I was listening to you and Bobby talking about it in the handoff, and...

478
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:01,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's... Like anything else, it kind of has that first little hurdle.

479
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:06,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Grinding pays off and this game doesn't stretch it out unreasonably.

480
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:15,232
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's actually... It's coming around a second time because I'm at a point where I like to clear the entirety of the areas.

481
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:23,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted a screenshot to Steam two nights ago or something like that that I finally, for the first time...

482
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:24,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

483
00:37:46,684 --> 00:38:03,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a good place right now it's a good way further than I am that's for sure and it's just managing the upgrades and figuring out how I want to proceed from there and finally taking on the third boss and holding my own for more than like 30 seconds but yeah very fun game and so much fun

484
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:04,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

485
00:38:05,227 --> 00:38:08,270
[SPEAKER_04]: My number one game of the year will probably not come as a huge surprise.

486
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:20,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I mentioned on November 23rd, which was the day that the Xbox One came out, I said, isn't it funny that Nintendo today released two games that are damn near contenders for the game of the year?

487
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:24,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, both those games released ended up in my top three.

488
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:29,768
[SPEAKER_04]: You had Super Mario 3D World at number three, and The Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds, at number one.

489
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:30,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that game...

490
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:33,310
[SPEAKER_04]: is my fucking game of the year.

491
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:38,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think some of this is a little bit personal as well.

492
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:48,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that some big outlets put it in their number one to such controversy, but good for them because it's my number one too.

493
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to tell you, the way that they took...

494
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:56,467
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my top five retro favorites of all time, period.

495
00:38:57,147 --> 00:39:07,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And brought it into not like a remake or even a reimagining, but just another story, a chapter two in that game that you love, but now...

496
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:11,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got all that new technology of the current console.

497
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:19,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the way that it moved seamlessly from Super Nintendo to 3DS is just... It's so right.

498
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:21,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And it feels so great to play.

499
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love some of the changes they made to it.

500
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:28,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of the things were controversial where you rent the weapons now and you can do the dungeons in any order.

501
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:30,674
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's cool.

502
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:32,235
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it makes for a different...

503
00:39:32,695 --> 00:39:35,077
[SPEAKER_04]: and more Mega Man-esque Legend of Zelda, if you will.

504
00:39:35,117 --> 00:39:36,739
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's something a little bit different.

505
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:39,101
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is such a fun adventure to play.

506
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:42,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And I loved every second of it that I've played it.

507
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:49,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a Link to the Past wink for me that I loved.

508
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:54,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, yeah, fantastic game in my game of the year.

509
00:39:54,814 --> 00:39:58,697
[SPEAKER_09]: For the record, you could actually do two of the levels in Link to the Past out of order.

510
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:04,095
[SPEAKER_04]: The Last of Us, Hands Down, My Game of the Year, The Game Speaks for Itself

511
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:33,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Tech2030 says, Tales of Xillia, for sure.

512
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:37,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I clocked in like 50 hours in that game, and I'm about to go back in for a second time.

513
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:43,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see some other number ones here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

514
00:40:45,638 --> 00:40:48,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got mixed in with the number twos here.

515
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:51,920
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a bunch of people that did theirs in bulk at the start of all this.

516
00:40:52,020 --> 00:41:17,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's where I got to SG-100, Matt agrees, Grand Theft Auto 5 Degenerate Johnny says Dark Souls Code Man says Super Mario 3D World and Dark Tetsuya says Super Mario 3D World So there's a sampling of some of the answers there in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Open forum for a minute Honorable mentions, some games that didn't make your top three but they really deserve a shout out here as well Jamie

517
00:41:18,697 --> 00:41:20,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna say the stupid Pokemon.

518
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:27,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because it was the first ones that I actually wanted in a while, and I'm having fun with it so far.

519
00:41:27,324 --> 00:41:27,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cute.

520
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:29,226
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Pokemon.

521
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:30,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I like roller skates.

522
00:41:31,848 --> 00:41:35,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like that every time you accidentally bump into a chair, you sit on it.

523
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,833
[SPEAKER_09]: But other than that, I'm not too frustrated with.

524
00:41:37,993 --> 00:41:39,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also don't like the 50,007 Pikachus.

525
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:40,535
[SPEAKER_09]: 57,000 Pikachus.

526
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:44,699
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted a Pikachu.

527
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,062
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one that people want, so why not give it to them?

528
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:51,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you see nothing but Pikachu for another year.

529
00:41:51,665 --> 00:41:53,387
[SPEAKER_04]: True, and that's all that's in the world trade.

530
00:41:54,047 --> 00:41:57,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you mentioned you were trying to decide between a few games there.

531
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,091
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your honorable mentions?

532
00:41:59,292 --> 00:42:01,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

533
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:03,476
[SPEAKER_09]: I just bought that.

534
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:05,317
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks pretty awesome.

535
00:42:05,337 --> 00:42:09,241
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I bought that too, and then I was like, I have to do Uplay.

536
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:10,782
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot about that.

537
00:42:11,617 --> 00:42:25,975
[SPEAKER_12]: um and then let's see the Stanley Parable probably be another one um oh that's pretty much it Jason because I couldn't find a place for it in the top three and just because it

538
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:28,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another game, Little Inferno

539
00:42:56,548 --> 00:43:12,434
[SPEAKER_09]: You were talking a lot about that game when it first came out, I remember that I mean, it's worth a playthrough at least once The combos are hilarious But once you get past that, it's sort of like weird But it was really fun, I liked it Oh, and Limbo Limbo was fun

540
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:30,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to note for some honorable mentions I have as well I don't know if you have some extras Jason but some honorable mentions I have as well I think the first half of this year was usually the first half of the year is not as strong as it was this year but we had some great games just in the first three months of this year

541
00:43:31,116 --> 00:43:32,177
[SPEAKER_04]: and many, many more.

542
00:43:56,516 --> 00:44:07,299
[SPEAKER_04]: and is making a lot of people's year-end list and with good reason because it was so great to finally... It's like you play a game like Tomb Raider and you're like, yes, this is the Tomb Raider I wanted to play.

543
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:08,259
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

544
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:11,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomb Raider is definitely the most... Yeah, and it looks gorgeous.

545
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, for one, I'm kind of excited about the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One version.

546
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:20,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yes, it's a little weird to have a remake of a game that was just out, but at the same time, it's like...

547
00:44:20,902 --> 00:44:24,583
[SPEAKER_04]: With even more power, I'm really excited to see what they're going to pull off.

548
00:44:24,883 --> 00:44:27,344
[SPEAKER_04]: So I loved Tomb Raider.

549
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:28,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I do need to add another one on my list, too.

550
00:44:29,184 --> 00:44:29,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Skullgirls.

551
00:44:30,345 --> 00:44:30,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course.

552
00:44:30,865 --> 00:44:31,445
[SPEAKER_04]: For fighting games.

553
00:44:31,485 --> 00:44:32,285
[SPEAKER_09]: That one was really fun.

554
00:44:32,585 --> 00:44:32,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

555
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:34,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, any others?

556
00:44:34,346 --> 00:44:37,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean to cut you off a minute ago, but Hotline Miami.

557
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:38,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good one.

558
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:39,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I haven't put enough time into.

559
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:42,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I just bought that for Dan because it was a dollar.

560
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:46,028
[SPEAKER_04]: More things to throw out in the chat room here.

561
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:46,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

562
00:44:46,948 --> 00:44:47,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Some honorable mentions.

563
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:57,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeon Buster says Metal Gear Solid Revengeance, Tomb Raider, Tech 2030 says Ni No Kuni, Tomb Raider, Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite were all first three months.

564
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:58,596
[SPEAKER_04]: That was crazy.

565
00:44:59,236 --> 00:45:02,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Cialis' Pokemon XY, SteamWorld Dig, Team Fortress 2.

566
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:04,320
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still a lot of people.

567
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there are still a lot of people playing that.

568
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:08,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome Unicorn, Guacamelee.

569
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:10,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Guacamelee is great fun.

570
00:45:11,024 --> 00:45:13,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura, you mentioned you just bought that.

571
00:45:14,076 --> 00:45:15,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Shadowrun Returns, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition

572
00:45:35,061 --> 00:45:39,383
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt, Don't Starve, Poker Night 2, Pokemon XY, and DuckTales Remastered.

573
00:45:39,443 --> 00:45:40,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, DuckTales.

574
00:45:41,063 --> 00:45:45,445
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as the cutscene thing bothered me, the game was a lot of fun.

575
00:45:46,405 --> 00:45:48,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And the new level was frustratingly hard.

576
00:45:49,406 --> 00:45:51,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I have another game that is definitely an honorable mention.

577
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:53,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

578
00:45:53,827 --> 00:45:56,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Vesuvius was crazy.

579
00:45:56,568 --> 00:45:57,909
[SPEAKER_09]: This is because of my heart.

580
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:00,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Namco High.

581
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:01,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Shh.

582
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:03,375
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously!

583
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:08,237
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like such a... You know me and parodies and satires and tributes and things.

584
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:10,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking love that game.

585
00:46:10,217 --> 00:46:13,038
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me laugh every time I play it.

586
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:23,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Just knowing the characters from the obscure Namco titles and the Homestuck characters in it and playing as the cousin of the Prince of All Cosmos.

587
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:27,962
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so crazy that it's stupidly fun.

588
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:32,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Not quite enough to make it into my top three, but definitely has a warm, fuzzy place in my heart.

589
00:46:33,723 --> 00:46:34,063
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

590
00:46:35,323 --> 00:46:36,263
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, good discussion.

591
00:46:36,323 --> 00:46:36,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of great games.

592
00:46:36,923 --> 00:46:38,404
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very good year for games.

593
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:45,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, you get two new consoles, and I'm sure they're going to really start to roll out some of the heavy hitters next year and the year after.

594
00:46:45,785 --> 00:46:48,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We already know that because of the delays, unfortunately.

595
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:48,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

596
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year is going to be a great resurgence...

597
00:46:52,386 --> 00:46:53,467
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our poor wallets, collectively.

598
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, you have things on PlayStation 4.

599
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,262
[SPEAKER_04]: You have, what was that, The Order, the one about the wolves and all that that looked really cool.

600
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:22,303
[SPEAKER_04]: They were shown at E3.

601
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have Infamous Second Son is next year as well.

602
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:27,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of great stuff on PlayStation.

603
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:27,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Drive Club.

604
00:47:28,247 --> 00:47:29,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Drive Club finally coming next year.

605
00:47:30,328 --> 00:47:34,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox One has the Quantum Break, the new Halo.

606
00:47:34,691 --> 00:47:36,292
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's going to be the holiday thing next year.

607
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:38,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of great things on there as well.

608
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:42,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I'm sure the current-gen consoles aren't stopping either.

609
00:47:42,557 --> 00:47:44,658
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be another Mass Effect game.

610
00:47:45,000 --> 00:48:12,386
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course Nintendo on Planet Nintendo where they do things Nintendo's way they will have Mario Kart 8 is going to be huge a lot of people theorizing they'll at least tease the next Zelda if it's not out next holiday Smash Brothers will probably be a big holiday one for sure and who knows what else from Planet Nintendo I expect that game to be more like mid-year there's no way they're going to take it to holiday season next year but maybe we should save predictions for later

611
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,026
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

612
00:48:35,385 --> 00:49:03,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I played some stuff Animal Crossing and I played some Final Fantasy 14 and I got some of my old school friends into Final Fantasy 14 people from my Digimon days and stuff and words and other games I bought a bunch of games that I haven't started I played some Fractal I played some Mass Effect 3 I played some Mass Effect 2 because basically I have a new computer

613
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:07,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that was your holiday gift, huh?

614
00:49:08,082 --> 00:49:10,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really the computer, the guts in it are new.

615
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:12,967
[SPEAKER_09]: The case, the motherboard, the processor.

616
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:19,033
[SPEAKER_09]: The only things that we carried over from my old computer were my graphics card, my power supply, and my hard drive.

617
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:22,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I already have a 3TB external storage as well.

618
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:23,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha!

619
00:49:49,692 --> 00:50:12,584
[SPEAKER_09]: with my new processor and everything the installs like they don't take long at all because first of all we have our own router so we get better speeds with our router and everything and then my computer is so fast now that and then Dan just took all the old guts and threw together a new computer because we had the extras he's like let's give this one to my mom there you go

620
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:14,838
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what he said.

621
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:20,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I've just been playing just random things, really.

622
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,882
[SPEAKER_09]: And more Namco High.

623
00:50:22,902 --> 00:50:24,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that game is crack.

624
00:50:26,084 --> 00:50:26,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.

625
00:50:27,845 --> 00:50:28,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how about you?

626
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,406
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

627
00:50:31,186 --> 00:50:32,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I bought a lot of things.

628
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,969
[SPEAKER_12]: I played a few things this week.

629
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:38,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, surprisingly enough, not Grand Theft Auto 4.

630
00:50:39,807 --> 00:51:07,895
[SPEAKER_12]: and that's kind of surprising because they had their holiday thing where they had it snowing and everything and just didn't get a chance to play it that's because it's buried under cores right now I did play I played Duke Nukem forever and it was terrible unfortunately it kept crashing every single level it would crash every single level so after about

631
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:12,368
[SPEAKER_12]: 7 levels, I said, fuck it, and I installed the game.

632
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:13,269
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm done with it.

633
00:51:13,889 --> 00:51:15,230
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not good in any way.

634
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:19,392
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, it's absolutely terrible.

635
00:51:20,093 --> 00:51:21,894
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not what Duke Nukem games should be.

636
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:23,575
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no point to it.

637
00:51:23,855 --> 00:51:28,058
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like they're more fascinating with, hey, what kind of interactive things can we make?

638
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:33,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, cool, look, we made all these light switches and shit you can do that you don't really need to even mess with.

639
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,202
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the game's just very basic looking.

640
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:36,624
[SPEAKER_12]: It just looks old.

641
00:51:37,044 --> 00:51:39,005
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how to really describe beyond that.

642
00:51:41,106 --> 00:51:41,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Other things I played.

643
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:48,211
[SPEAKER_12]: I played a little bit of a brand new game I bought, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.

644
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:52,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, this is an indie game, and it's kind of cool.

645
00:51:52,253 --> 00:52:02,039
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a cross between almost like a 30-second hero and like a shooter and the Oregon Trail.

646
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:32,332
[SPEAKER_12]: so you're in a wagon like the Oregon Trail and it's like day one you've encountered some wildlife go hunting and so your actual wagon is just shooting out bullets and you have to kill all these things and avoid hitting the animals and stuff and you collect meat that way and it just keeps popping up different random little mini games almost and it's just ridiculous it's a lot of fun and pretty cheap so I played that I played through the Stanley Parable

647
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,811
[SPEAKER_12]: and quite a bit through that.

648
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:48,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I've pretty much finished the game and I've gotten most of the achievements so far aside from some of the ridiculous ones like where you have to mod your date on your computer and stuff.

649
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:57,340
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, let's see, I played a little bit of Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

650
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,641
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit more of that.

651
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:00,501
[SPEAKER_12]: That was kind of fun.

652
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,422
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried Proteus

653
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:11,338
[SPEAKER_12]: which is kind of a very retro-looking 3D first-person, I don't know, art game, I guess.

654
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:17,382
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not really a point to it, but I was just showing it to Josh because I wanted to show him a game that wasn't scary, I guess.

655
00:53:18,202 --> 00:53:21,564
[SPEAKER_12]: And so he dug that a bit, and it was neat.

656
00:53:21,805 --> 00:53:22,605
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know.

657
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:23,486
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very short.

658
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:28,449
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think actually that's it.

659
00:53:29,059 --> 00:53:29,679
[SPEAKER_04]: FarCry3, BloodDragon

660
00:53:54,589 --> 00:54:23,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't Starve, Terraria, Left 4 Dead 2 because that was free, Operation Flashpoint Red River, Fuel, Overlord 2, Overlord, Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising, Clive Barker's Jericho, Damnation, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, Super Hexagon, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Rise of the Triad, the new one, Cube, Gateways, Drastic Man Epic, Half-Life Source, kind of as a gift,

661
00:54:24,212 --> 00:54:38,076
[SPEAKER_12]: LaMulana, Blockland, Ballpoint Universe, Infinite, Retrograde, No Way to Love 2, The Evolution, Final Fantasy 7, The Stanley Parable, The Orange Box, and finally, actually from last week, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.

662
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:38,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeez.

663
00:54:39,717 --> 00:54:39,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

664
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:40,797
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good haul.

665
00:54:42,698 --> 00:54:43,938
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was only 60 bucks.

666
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:46,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So averaging about two bucks a game.

667
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:48,701
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

668
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:55,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering that's the price of like one new Xbox One or PlayStation 4 game, that's doing really well for yourself.

669
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:56,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

670
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:57,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Hours and hours of entertainment, so why not?

671
00:54:58,707 --> 00:55:01,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And supporting a lot of indie games in there too.

672
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:06,672
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, my gaming week will be quick because I pretty much already talked about the big new one, which is Bioshock Infinite.

673
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:08,193
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, I also did buy Dust.

674
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:09,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did you?

675
00:55:09,374 --> 00:55:11,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did.

676
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:23,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I did also play, besides just Bioshock Infinite, I did some virtual consoling on the Wii U because nobody told me that Legend of the Mystical Ninja had come out on the Wii U. That is like, even, okay.

677
00:55:24,682 --> 00:55:49,317
[SPEAKER_04]: that's one of those games like I loved it when it was out on the Super Nintendo like originally and I love the fact that you know you had the little towns and you had the like mini games you could play in the towns which by the way one of which Gradius you can play Gradius in Legend of the Skull Ninja it's a scaled down version of it but it's there so you know I love that game as a kid playing it now in retrospect I'm kind of like this game was kind of derpy but

678
00:55:49,837 --> 00:55:55,721
[SPEAKER_04]: But I adore it for its derpiness and for some of the things it tried to do.

679
00:55:56,362 --> 00:56:02,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a great Miiverse post that is right now the most popular post in the Legend of the Mystical Ninja community.

680
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:06,228
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a screenshot of me playing Gradius.

681
00:56:07,069 --> 00:56:12,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put, look guys, I'm playing a virtual console game inside my virtual console game.

682
00:56:12,933 --> 00:56:14,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It's virtual console-ception, Horn.

683
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:15,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got like 25 likes.

684
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:18,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So my Miiverse moment of fame.

685
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:18,777
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got 25.

686
00:56:18,837 --> 00:56:18,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

687
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:21,178
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever it's called.

688
00:56:21,218 --> 00:56:22,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's fun.

689
00:56:22,898 --> 00:56:23,199
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

690
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:24,679
[SPEAKER_09]: How about 55, huh?

691
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:41,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is funny because for the first time ever, I finally got the joke in the game where there's a quiz show game that you can play where it asks you questions about the game in the first couple stages to see if you were paying attention.

692
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:45,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the questions is like, how many legs does the boss have?

693
00:56:46,288 --> 00:56:47,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answers are none.

694
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:49,450
[SPEAKER_04]: 2, and 573.

695
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:55,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the longest time, you know, you think, oh, 573, that's silly because it's a big number.

696
00:56:55,053 --> 00:56:56,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing has 573 legs.

697
00:56:56,413 --> 00:57:00,936
[SPEAKER_04]: But now looking back, you're like, oh, get it?

698
00:57:01,936 --> 00:57:03,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, which if you didn't know.

699
00:57:04,177 --> 00:57:05,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Konami.

700
00:57:05,538 --> 00:57:07,099
[SPEAKER_04]: 573 in Japanese.

701
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:09,780
[SPEAKER_04]: If you abbreviate some things and kind of say it out loud.

702
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,842
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to kind of take some liberties, but it is Konami, basically.

703
00:57:12,922 --> 00:57:14,983
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be Go-na-na-mi-tsu.

704
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:39,277
[SPEAKER_04]: so there you go but yeah you have to take some liberties but that's why Konami's kind of always married with the number 573 so there you go um let's see I think that was about oh then I also played uh Castlevania and because that came out on virtual console a few weeks ago and I just never picked it up until now and uh yeah that's between that Bioshock Infinite Final Fantasy 14 that was a week so there you go uh last but not least Jason your gaming week

705
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:40,750
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

706
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many, many years ago.

707
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:05,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard much out of her, but I saw something on her wish list.

708
00:58:05,762 --> 00:58:06,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I still talk to her.

709
00:58:06,462 --> 00:58:07,223
[SPEAKER_04]: She's still around.

710
00:58:07,403 --> 00:58:07,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

711
00:58:07,663 --> 00:58:10,285
[SPEAKER_04]: She's on Steam, and I just added her on 3DS a couple days ago.

712
00:58:10,305 --> 00:58:13,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if she's an active listener anymore, because I think she's just kind of... Just not in the chat.

713
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:16,729
[SPEAKER_09]: But she does have a very neat blog called The Eco Maker.

714
00:58:17,029 --> 00:58:17,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

715
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:23,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So check it out, people, because if you're into doing DIY things on the cheap...

716
00:58:24,054 --> 00:58:36,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they were, and I don't think she would mind me repeating, they were having some hard times a few months ago, and so, you know, they were really thinking like, you know, how can we do some things short-cutting, so a lot of great ideas in this blog on how to do it on the cheap.

717
00:58:36,604 --> 00:58:37,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's a good blog.

718
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:38,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

719
00:58:39,006 --> 00:58:48,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I, amusingly enough, I don't even remember what I sent her, but there was something at a good deal and I saw that it was on her wish list, so I jumped on it and sent it her way.

720
00:58:48,749 --> 00:58:50,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of which, you should open your present.

721
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I should open my present.

722
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:54,691
[SPEAKER_02]: A live unboxing, a live un-presenting.

723
00:58:55,171 --> 00:58:56,332
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

724
00:59:17,852 --> 00:59:19,715
[SPEAKER_02]: and it actually has graphics now.

725
00:59:19,795 --> 00:59:20,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Doom RL?

726
00:59:20,716 --> 00:59:21,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom RL.

727
00:59:21,336 --> 00:59:21,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not heard of this.

728
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:22,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom roguelike.

729
00:59:22,578 --> 00:59:24,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's surprisingly fun.

730
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:32,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little sad that the levels are, they're very roguelike instead of being very doom-like.

731
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:36,714
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean that in like classic rogue and, oh Jesus, NetHack.

732
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:38,235
[SPEAKER_02]: All that kind of stuff.

733
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:39,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Very classic, very boxy.

734
00:59:40,097 --> 00:59:43,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it scales down the Doom textures and plays it again.

735
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

736
00:59:45,221 --> 00:59:53,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll look in and see if I can make levels myself because it'd be pretty cool to actually put homaged, if not straight up ported, Doom worlds into Doom RL.

737
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:58,091
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, considering that I just gave it number one, a lot more Rogue Legacy as well.

738
00:59:58,211 --> 00:59:59,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got another...

739
01:00:00,673 --> 01:00:01,954
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 levels or some odd like that.

740
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:04,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Levels basically map to how many upgrades you got.

741
01:00:04,336 --> 01:00:07,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So a good heaping helping of hours in the last week.

742
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:12,541
[SPEAKER_02]: After I watched you streaming Super Hexagon, I tried that out for myself again.

743
01:00:13,442 --> 01:00:14,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's strange.

744
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:17,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it on iOS some time ago.

745
01:00:17,565 --> 01:00:19,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not terrible at it on iOS.

746
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:21,427
[SPEAKER_02]: But on a D-pad, I...

747
01:00:22,848 --> 01:00:23,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Just abysmal.

748
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:29,193
[SPEAKER_02]: My records are barely 20-30 seconds on any level and much less on the higher ones.

749
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:30,694
[SPEAKER_04]: No, those are really good scores.

750
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:32,576
[SPEAKER_02]: They really are.

751
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:36,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can beat 30 seconds relatively easy on iOS.

752
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:41,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's because for what it's worth, the D-pads on Apple laptops are very small.

753
01:00:42,464 --> 01:00:52,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to play them with these micro touches doesn't work very well where on iOS I just have to jam my finger onto one of the sides of the iPhone or iPad or what have you.

754
01:00:53,593 --> 01:00:55,994
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, fun reminder.

755
01:00:56,674 --> 01:00:58,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I played that game on iOS some time ago and it was really fun.

756
01:00:59,136 --> 01:01:04,719
[SPEAKER_02]: But Super Hexagon, Rogue Legacy, Doom RL, probably something else that I don't even recall at the moment.

757
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:06,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I talked about it last week.

758
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,222
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely the continuing Rogue week.

759
01:01:10,602 --> 01:01:11,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Rogue-like week.

760
01:01:12,403 --> 01:01:14,584
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a great week to have as far as I'm concerned.

761
01:01:14,784 --> 01:01:15,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It absolutely is.

762
01:01:15,445 --> 01:01:16,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I love me some roguelikes.

763
01:01:16,425 --> 01:01:16,685
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

764
01:01:17,906 --> 01:01:19,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Real quick, I forgot.

765
01:01:19,707 --> 01:01:20,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to Golf Land.

766
01:01:21,889 --> 01:01:22,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no.

767
01:01:48,507 --> 01:01:50,429
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, why did they even add that?

768
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:52,710
[SPEAKER_12]: It was completely annoying the entire time.

769
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:56,393
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, it's, it's, Golf Land's sad.

770
01:01:58,194 --> 01:02:07,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of the arcades we used to love are just, it's so hard to go into them and see just a sea of little kid gambling games, the ticket spitting games.

771
01:02:07,781 --> 01:02:08,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so hard to see that.

772
01:02:09,603 --> 01:02:11,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get Josh addicted to those.

773
01:02:11,504 --> 01:02:12,385
Yeah.

774
01:02:13,536 --> 01:02:13,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah.

775
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:14,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

776
01:02:15,879 --> 01:02:16,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

777
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we are going to get into some news, but first, some quick housekeeping.

778
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:24,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR or you can also follow us on Facebook.

779
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:25,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

780
01:02:25,953 --> 01:02:26,974
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also on Google+.

781
01:02:27,094 --> 01:02:29,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

782
01:02:30,198 --> 01:02:37,841
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape live again Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at vognetwork.com and we will be back.

783
01:02:37,961 --> 01:02:43,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean we didn't end up having any time off for the holidays just because these Sundays fell on pretty good days this year.

784
01:02:44,463 --> 01:02:51,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will be back again next week still looking at the potential of doing a road show in a couple weeks which will be very exciting because we haven't done one of those in a very long time.

785
01:02:51,946 --> 01:02:52,726
[SPEAKER_09]: And I should be able to.

786
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to be very exciting.

787
01:02:54,728 --> 01:03:06,199
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, Loki, it'll probably be right when the kid's here, but it'll work out for at least us to go hopefully hang with some of the old school friends at OLR and some of our friends in the Bay Area.

788
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:07,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be a very different type of episode.

789
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:07,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

790
01:03:08,721 --> 01:03:09,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, all right.

791
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:12,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.

792
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:12,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

793
01:03:12,703 --> 01:03:13,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason opened his present.

794
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:14,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I just unwrapped my present.

795
01:03:14,343 --> 01:03:14,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what'd you get?

796
01:03:15,664 --> 01:03:17,605
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of foil, which I am now wearing as a hat.

797
01:03:18,105 --> 01:03:18,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

798
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:19,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can.

799
01:03:19,346 --> 01:03:20,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very pretty.

800
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:22,287
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very blue, flowery, something.

801
01:03:22,487 --> 01:03:23,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to feel cool.

802
01:03:23,707 --> 01:03:27,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually want to go get some more to do decoupage with it just because it's so pretty.

803
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:29,684
[SPEAKER_02]: ThinkGeekShirt

804
01:03:48,393 --> 01:03:49,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Make me a hat with this foil.

805
01:03:49,974 --> 01:03:50,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

806
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:51,614
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

807
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:55,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, get that foil off my head because I can't see the news otherwise.

808
01:03:55,196 --> 01:03:56,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get to the news.

809
01:03:57,237 --> 01:03:58,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, start us off tonight.

810
01:03:58,978 --> 01:03:59,358
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

811
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:04,240
[SPEAKER_12]: So usually when we report these types of stories, it's normally EA shutting down servers.

812
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,041
[SPEAKER_12]: But this time around, it's actually going to be Sony.

813
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:11,223
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to be shutting down their online servers for a few of the PlayStation 3 games that they have.

814
01:04:12,204 --> 01:04:16,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting off with, of course, Gran Turismo 5 is going to be –

815
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:26,322
[SPEAKER_12]: having their servers turned off May 20th next year, and Resistance, the entire franchise, going down on March 28th.

816
01:04:26,803 --> 01:04:39,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, as of January 28th, they're going to be shutting down the online connectivity for MAG, SOCOM Special Forces, and SOCOM Confrontation, and SOCOM Confrontation and MAG.

817
01:04:40,308 --> 01:04:43,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are online-only games, so if you bought those, you're fucked.

818
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Your game is over.

819
01:04:47,543 --> 01:04:58,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of get the Gran Turismo 5 because they're trying to nudge people onto Gran Turismo 6, and I'm sure there's newer SOCOM games as well, but MAG, I kind of thought there was an audience still out there for that.

820
01:04:58,934 --> 01:05:05,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong, but I kind of thought MAG still had a little loyal following to it because it was really about massive groups of people, right?

821
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:05,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

822
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if they're not achieving that anymore.

823
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:25,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly don't have these numbers to back them up either, and I know I was interested in the game, never actually went into picking it up, but a game like that, if its numbers are dwindling, if they're not able to matchmake and keep the 4A, the massive number melee going on, then why keep supporting the game?

824
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Why keep putting the time and money into it?

825
01:05:28,834 --> 01:05:33,657
[SPEAKER_12]: I always think that you should have an offline component to at least do some sort of LAN or something, so

826
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:37,091
[SPEAKER_12]: You have something that's not just a coaster when this is done.

827
01:05:37,311 --> 01:05:37,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

828
01:05:38,871 --> 01:05:39,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

829
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:45,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking here in chat and Robert M says, I thought MAG had already shut down.

830
01:05:45,473 --> 01:05:47,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, they're shutting it down January 28th, 2014.

831
01:05:48,754 --> 01:05:55,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that this was actually announced some time ago in July of 2013 that they were going to shut it down.

832
01:05:55,256 --> 01:06:00,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So the news that it is shutting down is not necessarily new, but it is coming within the next few weeks.

833
01:06:00,618 --> 01:06:00,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

834
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:05,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft

835
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:46,117
[SPEAKER_12]: but they'll shut down someday 11 is still active isn't it oh yeah there's no no time no expectation for that to go away no game like that'll be around forever you know at least like something like that that's a pc game there's a chance that someone may be able to like you know run a a third party server or something like that after the game is shut down whereas something like this that's on playstation 3 there's no chance for that at all you're just

836
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,411
[SPEAKER_12]: You're out of luck.

837
01:06:47,511 --> 01:06:53,956
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, and yeah, maybe you're not playing the game, but I still think that there should always be at least some sort of an offline component.

838
01:06:54,416 --> 01:06:56,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that aspect of it.

839
01:06:56,838 --> 01:07:02,823
[SPEAKER_02]: If not an offline component, then a self-hosted game, a self-hosted server that you can run for nostalgia's sake.

840
01:07:02,903 --> 01:07:03,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

841
01:07:04,264 --> 01:07:06,726
[SPEAKER_04]: They did that when they shut down Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

842
01:07:07,387 --> 01:07:07,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't know.

843
01:07:08,187 --> 01:07:08,528
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.

844
01:07:08,908 --> 01:07:16,294
[SPEAKER_04]: They made it so that you could export your stuff and play on private servers, which is weird to see a company embrace that, but that was a really good thing, I think.

845
01:07:16,394 --> 01:07:17,135
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

846
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: For nostalgia's sake, being able to continue to play the game, revisiting old gaming memories, that would be a good thing for MMO makers to adopt and continue to do.

847
01:07:49,998 --> 01:08:03,362
[SPEAKER_12]: And considering, too, that eventually, I'm assuming, I don't know if they're going to carry on the SOCOM brand, so like PlayStation 4, but you might want to have some of that stuff still available to play so that, you know,

848
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:08,319
[SPEAKER_12]: People might know what SOCOM is when the PlayStation 4 version comes around.

849
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it is truly a franchise that they're going to sunset.

850
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:13,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we don't know.

851
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:15,744
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be happening.

852
01:08:16,945 --> 01:08:17,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

853
01:08:24,795 --> 01:08:28,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we shall move on with some more news.

854
01:08:28,496 --> 01:08:28,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason.

855
01:08:42,742 --> 01:09:00,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, not to jump on a presumption of Nintendo, but considering the age of their player base, having a productive game... Like, everybody is astonished when they find out that somebody building something in Minecraft is absurdly young.

856
01:09:00,372 --> 01:09:04,475
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're 7, they're 8, maybe even younger than that.

857
01:09:05,115 --> 01:09:10,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Wii gamepad gives you at least a little bit more flexibility than a standard controller would.

858
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:18,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people that just stick their kids in front of a laptop or a desktop and let them go to work.

859
01:09:18,642 --> 01:09:28,287
[SPEAKER_02]: But for something like this that's a little bit more accessible, this comes as a huge surprise to me because kids that I know really seem to enjoy Minecraft.

860
01:09:28,347 --> 01:09:29,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to get...

861
01:09:30,968 --> 01:09:33,569
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura did just give out some foil, so we have that part up

862
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:57,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not tinfoil, it's fake foil.

863
01:09:57,102 --> 01:10:00,723
[SPEAKER_04]: But it at least gets us halfway to these conspiracy theories.

864
01:10:01,443 --> 01:10:05,764
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but for real, like, you know, a map, duh, would be great on the Wii U gamepad.

865
01:10:06,304 --> 01:10:11,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just having your inventory screen and the crafting on the gamepad would make for a great experience.

866
01:10:11,826 --> 01:10:15,347
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the biggest pain in the ass of Minecraft is having to bring up the screen.

867
01:10:15,467 --> 01:10:16,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, where was I, man?

868
01:10:16,447 --> 01:10:20,568
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think, oh my gosh, it would make so much sense on the Wii U. So it is very disappointing.

869
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:21,319
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

870
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:41,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, who knows?

871
01:10:41,712 --> 01:10:42,452
[SPEAKER_04]: That's possible too.

872
01:10:43,293 --> 01:10:47,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't underestimate, though, guys, how huge Minecraft is with, like, kids.

873
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:48,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always shocked.

874
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:49,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Julian plays.

875
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:53,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always shocked at how many people I know with kids, and they're like, oh yeah, my kid plays Minecraft.

876
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:56,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And it probably needs not be said.

877
01:10:56,205 --> 01:10:57,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only just the kids.

878
01:10:57,446 --> 01:10:58,606
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole freaking family!

879
01:10:58,746 --> 01:10:59,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for real.

880
01:10:59,887 --> 01:11:03,448
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying, like, there are a ton of people that play Minecraft.

881
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:07,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it is pretty astounding what that game's accomplished.

882
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:22,215
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a buddy of mine that runs a private server and has, you know, Bucket and all the mods, and there's an IRC room that we congregate in, and so he runs a plugin that bridges the conversation in Minecraft back to IRC two-way.

883
01:11:23,075 --> 01:11:25,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And this wouldn't exist on a console, of course.

884
01:11:26,276 --> 01:11:53,397
[SPEAKER_02]: um but the the expansiveness is what makes that game and the game is built around expansion or surviving if you're if you play survival of course or building stuff expansion like me yeah or digging holes i get rid of stuff too there is an immense amount of potential now and i think last week we talked about like the long tail of nintendo there will not be an immediate return on investment but it will happen because that game is popular that is

885
01:11:54,057 --> 01:12:21,392
[SPEAKER_04]: you know that that would that would be a huge title to make its way to Nintendo but current plans unfortunately ain't gonna happen for the foreseeable future you know I had to really resist picking up the PlayStation 3 version but it's like dude you own it on the 360 and you own it on the PC and how much did you really play it on the PC but I've had this real bug to play Minecraft lately so Loki we need to get that VOG server back even if even if I've got to front the money for it I think that we got to make it happen so we can do it you don't need to front the money for it I just haven't gotten around I'll I'll do it I'll

886
01:12:22,452 --> 01:12:23,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

887
01:12:23,153 --> 01:12:24,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm excited.

888
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:26,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Christmas miracles happen again.

889
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:36,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you bomb the server and start new and maybe as an easy mode monsters thing where there's some challenge or something against it, I think that would be great.

890
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:45,644
[SPEAKER_12]: I backed up the server because they brought back the server for a few days and I was able to back it all up.

891
01:12:45,744 --> 01:12:49,106
[SPEAKER_12]: It's old now compared to the updates and everything.

892
01:12:49,446 --> 01:12:49,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Also,

893
01:12:50,516 --> 01:12:55,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Free Mode gets boring after a while because there's no real point, especially when there's not a lot of people playing at the same time.

894
01:12:55,099 --> 01:12:56,639
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why survival is kind of nice.

895
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.

896
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,042
[SPEAKER_09]: See, my favorite thing was doing all the creative stuff was digging holes and exploring.

897
01:13:02,122 --> 01:13:03,783
[SPEAKER_09]: So I didn't really care about the other stuff.

898
01:13:04,844 --> 01:13:05,184
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

899
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:07,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got some people in chat wanting to know when that's back up.

900
01:13:07,886 --> 01:13:08,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So look forward to that.

901
01:13:08,746 --> 01:13:09,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that'll be something for 2014.

902
01:13:10,747 --> 01:13:12,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but I do notice Robert M in chat says,

903
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:39,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, though, I'm going to tell you what stopped me from getting it on the PlayStation 3 is that we haven't heard what's happening with PlayStation 4 and Vita versions yet, and I want to wait and hear that, because will my PlayStation 3... Is it going to be cross-play amongst all of them?

904
01:13:39,112 --> 01:13:42,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if so, fine, I'll invest the money in the PlayStation 3 version right now.

905
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:47,637
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's not going to be cross-play and the PlayStation 4 is going to be different or whatever, then I'll probably just wait and get it on 4.

906
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:50,699
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be different on 4, I guarantee it, because

907
01:13:51,104 --> 01:13:55,808
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why right now the PlayStation 3 version is basically a port of the Xbox 360 one.

908
01:13:55,928 --> 01:14:00,251
[SPEAKER_12]: So 4 and Xbox One are going to have larger maps and probably more features.

909
01:14:01,332 --> 01:14:01,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

910
01:14:02,232 --> 01:14:02,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on.

911
01:14:02,853 --> 01:14:04,194
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us in the news?

912
01:14:05,038 --> 01:14:05,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Mass Effect stuff.

913
01:14:08,121 --> 01:14:22,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as you guys know, on November 7th, which was N7 day, we had a few tweets go in that showed some of the screens, not like full-on screenshots, but you could see computers in the background with a little bit here and there for the development of

914
01:14:23,195 --> 01:14:23,696
[SPEAKER_09]: BioWare BioWare

915
01:14:40,491 --> 01:15:09,388
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're basically saying and the tweet basically says great time playing the next Mass Effect game in Montreal ambitious beautiful fresh but recognizable and fun so and I'm from what this is it looks like it's just in the very early stages of level testing and design what a fucking tease though I know I'm so excited and scared literally I am Jesse Spano I am Jesse Spano in that scene when it was the new Mass Effect game I'm so excited and so scared

916
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:11,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be a Shepard story.

917
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:13,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little scared, but I'm really excited to play.

918
01:15:14,779 --> 01:15:15,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it.

919
01:15:15,781 --> 01:15:18,587
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get that trailer at E3.

920
01:15:19,028 --> 01:15:20,010
[SPEAKER_04]: By six months from now...

921
01:15:20,635 --> 01:15:22,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We will know about this game, DarkSakura.

922
01:15:22,396 --> 01:15:23,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, we will.

923
01:15:23,077 --> 01:15:23,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

924
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:29,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might make it for the holidays, although I kind of think spring 2015 is a little more realistic, but you never know.

925
01:15:30,002 --> 01:15:30,683
[SPEAKER_04]: If they can play it now.

926
01:15:30,703 --> 01:15:31,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still going to play it.

927
01:15:31,643 --> 01:15:32,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

928
01:15:32,384 --> 01:15:39,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I was very irritated with how more human-centric the last game went.

929
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:47,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see more expansion into the other species in the Mass Effect universe, but I'll wait and see what happens.

930
01:15:47,696 --> 01:15:52,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to reserve my judgment until I've actually got it in front of me playing it.

931
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:53,981
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I feel.

932
01:15:57,213 --> 01:15:59,093
[SPEAKER_09]: That and it better have the same good multiplayer.

933
01:15:59,513 --> 01:15:59,854
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

934
01:15:59,874 --> 01:16:01,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that was pretty freaking awesome.

935
01:16:01,534 --> 01:16:02,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know what's funny?

936
01:16:02,114 --> 01:16:09,715
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about server shutdowns earlier in the show, and I'm kind of surprised they haven't threatened to pull the plug on Mass Effect 3 yet, but I'm sure there's still a lot of people that play online.

937
01:16:10,156 --> 01:16:10,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, heck yeah.

938
01:16:10,856 --> 01:16:15,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I don't know about, like, Wii U, but who knows?

939
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:15,977
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

940
01:16:16,237 --> 01:16:21,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so borked on Wii U just with the whole Genesis thing, and you didn't get all of your options.

941
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:22,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

942
01:16:23,299 --> 01:16:29,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, if you're going to get it on any system, get it on the Xbox because you can totally mod your files.

943
01:16:30,266 --> 01:16:31,087
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have to get a console.

944
01:16:31,507 --> 01:16:32,348
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have to get a console.

945
01:16:33,109 --> 01:16:35,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

946
01:16:35,972 --> 01:16:40,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I have a feeling there's not going to be much, but it's a part of the show we always do.

947
01:16:40,997 --> 01:16:44,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, how's the US look for release dates?

948
01:16:44,921 --> 01:16:45,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

949
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:48,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a damn thing coming out this week.

950
01:16:48,975 --> 01:16:52,196
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, let's travel to Japan and take a look and see if anything's coming out there.

951
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of don't think so.

952
01:16:54,496 --> 01:16:56,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little slow in bringing it up here, so sorry, guys.

953
01:16:56,857 --> 01:16:59,257
[SPEAKER_04]: They still do not have PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, remember.

954
01:16:59,297 --> 01:17:00,058
[SPEAKER_04]: That is coming out later.

955
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:09,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Mafia 2 gets a price reduction, and there's some third-party game pads on the PlayStation 3 on December 31st.

956
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:11,001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something, right?

957
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:11,781
[SPEAKER_04]: How about on the Xbox 360?

958
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:14,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing on the Xbox 360.

959
01:17:14,822 --> 01:17:15,822
[SPEAKER_04]: What about on the handhelds?

960
01:17:15,842 --> 01:17:17,343
[SPEAKER_04]: How about on the Vita or the 3DS?

961
01:17:18,223 --> 01:17:18,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing on the Vita.

962
01:17:21,945 --> 01:17:26,227
[SPEAKER_04]: 3DS gets Puzzle & Dragons Z. Oh, never mind.

963
01:17:26,287 --> 01:17:30,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are just decorative things.

964
01:17:30,389 --> 01:17:32,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Puzzle & Dragons really big on 3DS over there?

965
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:33,310
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird.

966
01:17:35,592 --> 01:17:35,912
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

967
01:17:57,538 --> 01:17:58,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Jack and shit.

968
01:17:58,579 --> 01:17:59,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured for the UK.

969
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:00,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

970
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:00,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

971
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:01,661
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

972
01:18:01,741 --> 01:18:02,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

973
01:18:02,522 --> 01:18:02,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

974
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:03,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck all.

975
01:18:04,223 --> 01:18:05,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck all's coming out.

976
01:18:05,804 --> 01:18:08,686
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got enough games to play right now is the moral of this story.

977
01:18:08,766 --> 01:18:09,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Steam.

978
01:18:09,947 --> 01:18:10,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Release dates.

979
01:18:10,848 --> 01:18:11,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Apps are freaking literally nothing.

980
01:18:12,049 --> 01:18:12,369
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

981
01:18:12,489 --> 01:18:15,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

982
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:15,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

983
01:18:16,772 --> 01:18:17,292
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

984
01:18:17,813 --> 01:18:23,637
[SPEAKER_12]: So unfortunately, one of the games I was actually looking forward to next year

985
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:53,068
[SPEAKER_12]: No Man's Sky The developer, Hello Games, suffered some flood damage over the week and it took out some of their servers and PCs and stuff like that monitors, furniture a bunch of other stuff I'm not sure if that necessarily obviously that might affect some of the development of the game but they haven't really said that anything's been delayed yet I'm sure they have all that stuff backed up anyways

986
01:18:53,667 --> 01:19:22,534
[SPEAKER_12]: and then also they're saying they're not really insured for the flood damage but hopefully they may get some sort of help from Microsoft I guess they're saying Phil Spencer said he might be able to look into helping them out but I don't know they'll see maybe they'll do some funding stuff to recover some of the things that they had that need to be replaced or it kind of sucks that they didn't have flood insurance I'm not really sure in the area that they're at if it's

987
01:19:22,987 --> 01:19:25,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Prone to flooding or if this is just some freak thing.

988
01:19:25,689 --> 01:19:26,950
[SPEAKER_12]: That sucks either way.

989
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:35,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's really unfortunate, but these Mother Nature events, or as they call them, acts of God or whatever, these things are going to happen.

990
01:19:35,477 --> 01:19:48,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a solemn reminder to have an emergency plan no matter who you are, what you do, what are you going to do if there's a fire or there's an earthquake or a tornado or whatever it is where you live.

991
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:50,909
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's put your offices on the second floor.

992
01:19:51,469 --> 01:19:52,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right, right.

993
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

994
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good luck to them, though.

995
01:19:56,571 --> 01:20:07,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they're able to make a recovery because that No Man's Sky did look very interesting, even though for some reason it's the one game they didn't show on TV, which was kind of shitty, but it was a good trailer.

996
01:20:08,355 --> 01:20:08,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

997
01:20:08,795 --> 01:20:09,095
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

998
01:20:10,118 --> 01:20:12,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Ragingator says that games are like Pokemans.

999
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:12,900
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta get them all.

1000
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:13,620
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you don't.

1001
01:20:14,501 --> 01:20:15,801
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get them all.

1002
01:20:15,861 --> 01:20:16,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't.

1003
01:20:16,962 --> 01:20:21,845
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, but you really don't need to because there are games that stink on ice.

1004
01:20:22,557 --> 01:20:24,398
[SPEAKER_04]: All the networks online were getting hammered.

1005
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:45,866
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation Network shut down for an amount of time.

1006
01:20:46,247 --> 01:20:47,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live was down.

1007
01:20:47,368 --> 01:20:50,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was down quite as long as the others, but it was down for a little bit.

1008
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:52,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo got hammered as well.

1009
01:20:52,612 --> 01:21:06,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo, you know, very apologetic via their Facebook page saying the problem, the reason why Nintendo Network went down is because the influx of Nintendo Network accounts being created and trying to get onto the eShop platform.

1010
01:21:06,585 --> 01:21:16,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, when you sell a 3DS with an eShop copy of a game that a lot of people want to play, I mean... Translation, because of y'all greedy bitches.

1011
01:21:16,973 --> 01:21:27,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think it's necessarily that they're greedy, but it's just here we go again with poor planning, especially when it comes to network stuff, and it's a bad trend for games.

1012
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:31,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of some of the worst games of the year, calling out SimCity.

1013
01:21:32,144 --> 01:21:35,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I personally am not calling it out because I'm going to be honest, I didn't play it.

1014
01:21:36,087 --> 01:21:36,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1015
01:21:52,882 --> 01:22:08,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, maybe a little bit apples to oranges is what I'm saying there, because obviously a 3DS does not require you to be online, but Nintendo certainly took strides with their latest patch, and by only bundling in the eShop version of some of these games on some of their consoles, you know, they were kind of asking for it on Christmas Day.

1016
01:22:08,666 --> 01:22:14,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you kind of look at something like this and you go, Nintendo, y'all got no one to blame but yourselves.

1017
01:22:15,048 --> 01:22:16,289
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and your poor planning.

1018
01:22:16,869 --> 01:22:21,270
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I'm curious to actually how many consoles they sold, because you know, it...

1019
01:22:22,332 --> 01:22:30,362
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't sell that many and they couldn't handle the influx of a couple thousand people, then I'd be a little curious.

1020
01:22:30,462 --> 01:22:32,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's not just the Wii U, Loki.

1021
01:22:32,065 --> 01:22:33,026
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 3DS.

1022
01:22:33,787 --> 01:22:36,791
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that, but come on.

1023
01:22:37,331 --> 01:22:38,833
[SPEAKER_12]: They know how many consoles they're putting out.

1024
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:39,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

1025
01:22:40,137 --> 01:22:47,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyhow, the Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DS was taken down, and last we heard it was supposed to be back up 4 a.m.

1026
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:47,759
[SPEAKER_04]: today.

1027
01:22:47,959 --> 01:22:49,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't checked to see if it was back up.

1028
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.

1029
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:54,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen Miiverse has been pretty active and so forth, so I think things are running again over there.

1030
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:58,602
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that was not so great.

1031
01:22:59,682 --> 01:23:05,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, kind of as a snowball effect, the Pokemon Bank was supposed to come out on December 27th.

1032
01:23:06,704 --> 01:23:14,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It was out and then it got pulled with no Western launch yet announced because this was supposed to come out here as well.

1033
01:23:14,746 --> 01:23:20,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Pokemon Bank was the new system where you were going to be able to take Pokemon from X and Y and put them in the cloud.

1034
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:23,869
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how you were going to be able to transfer Pokemon to future games.

1035
01:23:24,409 --> 01:23:29,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And no matter what system Nintendo has Pokemon out on next, you'd be able to transfer things through the cloud.

1036
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:35,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So because of the network difficulties, they pulled the game because they wanted people to stop trying to get the game.

1037
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:36,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It's causing too much bandwidth.

1038
01:23:37,316 --> 01:23:41,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, you should have known when you put all this shit out at once, something like this would happen.

1039
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,081
[SPEAKER_04]: So shame, shame.

1040
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:46,403
[SPEAKER_04]: But for better or worse, they did delay this a little bit.

1041
01:23:46,783 --> 01:23:47,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Pokemon in the cloud?

1042
01:23:48,505 --> 01:23:49,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo used Fly.

1043
01:23:49,605 --> 01:23:50,366
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't very effective.

1044
01:23:52,336 --> 01:23:54,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Womp womp.

1045
01:23:54,898 --> 01:23:55,238
Fired!

1046
01:23:55,698 --> 01:24:08,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, if you want to try Pokemon Bank, you're supposed to be able to download until January 31st, 2014 and be able to download a 30-day trial and then it will be $5 a year.

1047
01:24:09,346 --> 01:24:13,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you access the bank before September 30th of 2014, you'll get Celebi for free.

1048
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:18,651
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go, 3,000 Pokemon can go in the bank and it will... Did you say celibacy?

1049
01:24:19,111 --> 01:24:19,772
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Celebi.

1050
01:24:20,632 --> 01:24:31,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It will work with Pokemon Black, White, Black 2, White 2 through the PokeTransporter and X and Y. So that's how you can get those generations in there as well and then whatever happens next.

1051
01:24:32,722 --> 01:24:33,242
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1052
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:38,426
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, we don't know when that will come out, but I'm assuming probably in the first week of January is when they're going to push that back.

1053
01:24:38,466 --> 01:24:41,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will probably have a very quiet launch because they don't want everybody to hit it at once.

1054
01:24:42,669 --> 01:24:45,772
[SPEAKER_04]: But once it hits the internet, open the floodgates!

1055
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:50,592
[SPEAKER_04]: FifthDream in chat saying, the Pokemons are clogging up our clouds.

1056
01:24:50,673 --> 01:24:52,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that is kind of what happened.

1057
01:24:53,515 --> 01:24:57,759
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like in WALL-E when the ship was trying to escape and it just blew through all of the satellites.

1058
01:24:59,320 --> 01:24:59,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1059
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:06,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane where, you know what, you didn't have games in the cloud.

1060
01:25:08,385 --> 01:25:10,426
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1061
01:25:10,506 --> 01:25:12,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually picked something a little on the obscure side.

1062
01:25:12,447 --> 01:25:13,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked Ordine.

1063
01:25:34,818 --> 01:25:35,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Ordyne it is!

1064
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:25,448
[SPEAKER_09]: and you have characters named Yuichiro Tomari who is a scientist and the main protagonist and you get a red ship and then you get Sunday Chin who is a Chinese assistant and the pilot of the green ship you get Kana Aihara who is Tomari's fiance you get Dr. Kubota who is the main antagonist you get Miki-chan who is a shopkeeper and Dream Company Limited who is a robot who flies around and helps you

1065
01:26:25,988 --> 01:26:28,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, it's just a really cute little shooter.

1066
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:30,191
[SPEAKER_09]: You get all the usual power-ups, you know.

1067
01:26:32,332 --> 01:26:35,554
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thing about this is that it came out in 1988.

1068
01:26:37,516 --> 01:26:41,218
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's one of those Namco System 2 hardware games.

1069
01:26:41,939 --> 01:26:44,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came out on PC Engine in 1989.

1070
01:26:45,061 --> 01:26:47,542
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came out for the TurboGrafx in 1990.

1071
01:26:47,662 --> 01:26:51,045
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the Namco Museum Volume 4.

1072
01:26:51,385 --> 01:26:53,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has come out on the North American Virtual Console.

1073
01:26:54,967 --> 01:27:00,233
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just a cute little game.

1074
01:27:00,413 --> 01:27:04,337
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually advertised as a comical shooter.

1075
01:27:05,018 --> 01:27:07,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta be honest, it looks a lot like Fantasy Zone.

1076
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:09,563
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot, a lot like Fantasy Zone.

1077
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:10,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does.

1078
01:27:10,204 --> 01:27:12,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It has that same cartoony, cutesy style.

1079
01:27:12,586 --> 01:27:14,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

1080
01:27:14,801 --> 01:27:17,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the one thing about this, though, is that... It's like a little shop.

1081
01:27:17,843 --> 01:27:19,984
[SPEAKER_04]: See, he just flew in the shop, like you do in fantasy mode.

1082
01:27:20,144 --> 01:27:21,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, exactly.

1083
01:27:22,386 --> 01:27:29,430
[SPEAKER_09]: With this particular one, you basically, like, for example, Miyuki's channel will stop by, like you were just saying.

1084
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:36,614
[SPEAKER_09]: When Dream Company passes by, you can win crystals to buy weapons.

1085
01:27:37,695 --> 01:27:42,638
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have one-hit kills, but you can buy your extra lives as you go through the game.

1086
01:27:43,158 --> 01:27:44,599
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a cutesy little game.

1087
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:45,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was fun.

1088
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:48,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole bunch extra special to it.

1089
01:27:48,103 --> 01:27:51,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they do like a little celebration dance when they clear the round.

1090
01:27:51,526 --> 01:27:57,791
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do believe that this is the one that Albatross was from in Namco High.

1091
01:27:58,772 --> 01:28:05,858
[SPEAKER_09]: So whenever you guys see Albatross or Al-B-Tross, as he is also known in that, this is the game he's from.

1092
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:08,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to double check it just to make sure.

1093
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:10,042
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm pretty sure that is it.

1094
01:28:11,949 --> 01:28:12,750
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's your classic game.

1095
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:13,250
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this?

1096
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Some type of like roulette game that's in there too?

1097
01:28:15,611 --> 01:28:16,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Like little gambling games?

1098
01:28:16,972 --> 01:28:18,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's when you run into the robot.

1099
01:28:19,114 --> 01:28:19,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1100
01:28:20,694 --> 01:28:21,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty cool.

1101
01:28:21,075 --> 01:28:21,375
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1102
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:22,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Just double checking.

1103
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:28,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit, I had never played this game before, but I kind of want to, I wish it was on one of the newer retro game collections so I could check it out.

1104
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:28,920
[SPEAKER_04]: But there it is.

1105
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:34,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week, boys and girls, Ordine, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1106
01:28:35,444 --> 01:28:36,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Good pick, DarkSakura.

1107
01:28:36,264 --> 01:28:37,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it when you pick things I haven't heard of.

1108
01:28:37,907 --> 01:28:44,133
[SPEAKER_09]: And also just to say, you know, again, if you haven't played Namco High, it's really fucking fun.

1109
01:28:45,133 --> 01:28:47,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And it'll work on your phone because it is HTML5.

1110
01:28:48,136 --> 01:28:48,496
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1111
01:28:49,697 --> 01:28:53,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm double checking on the students one more time just so I can be sure.

1112
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:55,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not loading up.

1113
01:28:55,703 --> 01:28:57,064
[SPEAKER_09]: So sorry.

1114
01:28:57,504 --> 01:28:59,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll probably be able to tell you guys soon.

1115
01:29:00,859 --> 01:29:01,159
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1116
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:05,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe she can tell us after the break because it is that time to take a break here at Orange Launch Radio.

1117
01:29:05,723 --> 01:29:08,465
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got plenty more show when we come back.

1118
01:29:09,246 --> 01:29:09,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wrong.

1119
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:10,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Albatross is from Rolling Thunder.

1120
01:29:10,727 --> 01:29:11,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what I was thinking.

1121
01:29:11,908 --> 01:29:12,148
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1122
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:16,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's not as much news tonight, so we're flying through that a little quickly.

1123
01:29:16,452 --> 01:29:17,993
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do still have the mailbag.

1135
01:30:41,518 --> 01:30:43,919
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, if it's after January 1st, you already missed out for the month.

1136
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:53,344
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're giving away a $20 gift card to many popular gaming services such as Nintendo Network and Xbox Live and so forth.

1137
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Also YouTube.

1138
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:30,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Jason, you've been working very hard on this YouTube, so I gotta say, and thank you for reminding me, we just put up last week, we just put, because YouTube is, again, YouTube runs one week behind, six days-ish, one week behind, just because we prefer to have folks listen via the places that really give us ratings, instead of giving Google ratings, giving us ratings.

1139
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:35,993
[SPEAKER_04]: First, but then we like having it on YouTube for discovery purposes.

1140
01:31:36,313 --> 01:31:42,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And starting with last week's episode, Jason, I don't know if you really plan on taking that level of effort every week, but I was very impressed.

1141
01:31:43,255 --> 01:31:49,936
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of made it more of like an archive where you actually bookmarked all the sections of the show and very easy to find a part of the show you're looking for.

1142
01:31:50,676 --> 01:31:52,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Some video synced up and things.

1143
01:31:52,997 --> 01:31:54,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the video is always going to sync up.

1144
01:31:55,037 --> 01:31:56,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I just completely screwed something up.

1145
01:31:56,838 --> 01:31:57,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1146
01:31:58,058 --> 01:31:59,379
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1147
01:32:19,389 --> 01:32:20,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, we're trying something new.

1148
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:22,031
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't know what it is yet.

1149
01:32:22,291 --> 01:32:23,472
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll surprise you a little later.

1150
01:32:23,712 --> 01:32:25,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what it is, but we're doing something new tonight.

1151
01:32:26,634 --> 01:32:29,076
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just how you always kind of think, like, how can I do that?

1152
01:32:29,096 --> 01:32:30,957
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I take this one step?

1153
01:32:31,998 --> 01:32:37,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've said previously as well, I've also never done video work before, and it's always been an incredible interest to me.

1154
01:32:38,103 --> 01:32:54,459
[SPEAKER_02]: and so this is this is one part learning design this is one part doing video editing this is one part being able to do a lot of post-production yeah I'm I'm contributing ways that are very fun for me and I plan to continue doing so and doing better each time

1155
01:32:54,659 --> 01:32:55,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, do what you love.

1156
01:32:55,519 --> 01:32:56,340
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I do this.

1157
01:33:15,525 --> 01:33:23,807
[SPEAKER_04]: was that it was recognized some of the stuff I do outside of work and that I work with audio and video and that type of production and things kind of outside of work.

1158
01:33:23,907 --> 01:33:27,148
[SPEAKER_04]: And that all plays into now, you know, what I do in my day job.

1159
01:33:27,228 --> 01:33:33,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, you know, all these years later, OLR is actually like help me get a job in a way.

1160
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird, but I'm so thankful for it.

1161
01:33:36,071 --> 01:33:38,131
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you guys for supporting it.

1162
01:33:38,471 --> 01:33:38,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1163
01:33:42,182 --> 01:33:42,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a job too.

1164
01:33:43,203 --> 01:33:43,803
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1165
01:33:43,864 --> 01:33:44,744
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a job as well.

1166
01:33:44,764 --> 01:33:45,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say where I'm working.

1167
01:33:46,086 --> 01:33:46,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1168
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you actually know me in person.

1169
01:33:49,188 --> 01:33:53,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because given the nature of the job, I don't really want to.

1170
01:33:53,772 --> 01:33:55,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely understand.

1171
01:33:55,874 --> 01:33:57,476
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will be doing some tech support.

1172
01:33:58,396 --> 01:33:59,057
[SPEAKER_09]: and that will be fun.

1173
01:34:01,978 --> 01:34:06,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the thing that floored me is that I just happened to put it on my Facebook like I normally do.

1174
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,381
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so happy I got the job.

1175
01:34:08,621 --> 01:34:09,162
[SPEAKER_09]: 120 people.

1176
01:34:10,202 --> 01:34:11,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, how do I know that many people?

1177
01:34:12,423 --> 01:34:17,646
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank everyone who supported me in my attempts to find gainful employment.

1178
01:34:18,767 --> 01:34:40,190
[SPEAKER_09]: um thank you people who were just being happy for me because you know that means a lot to me too you know just a lot of uh selfless people I want to thank so thank you and um also listening to uh the break music makes me really want to watch Swing Girls again because

1179
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:43,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Mexican Flyer is one of the songs they do for the finale.

1180
01:34:43,451 --> 01:34:47,932
[SPEAKER_04]: We played some Space Channel 5 music here live, which I can't repeat on the podcast.

1181
01:34:48,272 --> 01:34:50,073
[SPEAKER_04]: We would especially not own that on YouTube.

1182
01:34:50,113 --> 01:34:52,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd get a copyright shutdown thing.

1183
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:54,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I don't know if Mexican Flyer is back in the public domain.

1184
01:34:54,574 --> 01:34:57,615
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sega version definitely isn't.

1185
01:34:57,635 --> 01:35:04,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, but it is big band swing music, which really brought that genre into the fore.

1186
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says that we're happy because you're happy.

1187
01:35:08,463 --> 01:35:09,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1188
01:35:09,184 --> 01:35:15,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to give an arm of support to our buddy Brad over at PodCulture because he's job hunting right now and he's looking for something.

1189
01:35:15,734 --> 01:35:19,820
[SPEAKER_09]: It took me three years so I hope it doesn't take you that long.

1190
01:35:20,943 --> 01:35:24,146
[SPEAKER_04]: We are keeping our fingers and toesies crossed for our friend Brad.

1191
01:35:25,247 --> 01:35:33,935
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need a really smart guy who produces a solid podcast about sci-fi and geek culture and a little bit of games and a little bit of everything, hire Brad.

1192
01:35:34,595 --> 01:35:35,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1193
01:35:35,302 --> 01:35:39,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I downloaded it, I haven't watched it yet, but someone spoiled the regeneration for me.

1194
01:35:57,148 --> 01:35:57,629
[SPEAKER_09]: David Tennant

1195
01:36:15,552 --> 01:36:16,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I have that box set.

1196
01:36:16,272 --> 01:36:17,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get that back for my friend.

1197
01:36:39,898 --> 01:37:06,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't watch hardly any TV when I finished Orange is the New Black that was a miracle that I actually had the attention span to watch 13 hours worth of TV at any rate since I mentioned it if nobody out there has seen Swing Girls you can find it it's inexpensive now great little movie and yes it has subtitles but I just have to say if you like the music in Space Channel 5 get into Big Band there you go Loki you still there with us?

1198
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:09,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, he took a break.

1199
01:37:09,841 --> 01:37:10,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, he's there, hey!

1200
01:37:12,263 --> 01:37:20,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird when I can't see you, but Loki Baby Watch is on, which is why Loki is on Skype with us for a few weeks here, but Loki, any plans for the new year?

1201
01:37:20,669 --> 01:37:24,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, no, not really.

1202
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:32,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since Josh dressed up like a firework for Halloween, is he excited about New Year's Eve, or do you guys try not to get him too worked up about that?

1203
01:37:33,711 --> 01:37:35,093
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't stay up for any of that stuff.

1204
01:37:35,394 --> 01:37:36,215
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't know what's going on.

1205
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:39,702
[SPEAKER_12]: He has trouble figuring out what day it is during the day.

1206
01:37:42,728 --> 01:37:45,694
[SPEAKER_12]: He thinks when he goes down for a nap or something like that, that's another day.

1207
01:37:46,112 --> 01:37:54,076
[SPEAKER_04]: and so he doesn't understand time right now.

1208
01:37:54,136 --> 01:37:55,677
[SPEAKER_04]: You and the jokes need to stop.

1209
01:37:56,697 --> 01:37:57,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I never will.

1210
01:37:58,678 --> 01:37:59,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

1211
01:38:00,119 --> 01:38:03,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the intern Drew position here.

1212
01:38:03,781 --> 01:38:06,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

1213
01:38:07,523 --> 01:38:14,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so next month they've got some pretty decent stuff on PlayStation Plus and I'm

1214
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,291
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of excited about this.

1215
01:38:16,631 --> 01:38:20,912
[SPEAKER_12]: In case you haven't played it yet, Bioshock Infinite is going to be one of the titles I've given away free.

1216
01:38:21,372 --> 01:38:35,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Devil May Cry, also Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, and they're going to have some stuff for the Vita as well, Smartass and Worms Battle Islands, and Don't Starve will be available for PlayStation 4.

1217
01:38:36,798 --> 01:38:38,959
[SPEAKER_12]: So, not bad.

1218
01:38:38,999 --> 01:38:44,101
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really curious to see Microsoft step it up for the Xbox, you know,

1219
01:38:44,892 --> 01:38:45,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1220
01:39:11,885 --> 01:39:32,604
[SPEAKER_02]: is fantastic there was the suggestions going around that even if you don't have a PS4 yet if you pick up well there's no free plus titles for 4 not retail but if you are a plus subscriber even if you don't have this system you can still buy it online and re-download it in the future which is

1221
01:39:33,365 --> 01:39:35,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty damn fantastic.

1222
01:39:35,706 --> 01:39:41,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been doing that even though I've been away from my PlayStation 3 for two, three months.

1223
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:44,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1224
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:50,312
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm looking forward to it and definitely recommend anyone that hasn't played Bioshock Infinite, definitely give it a try.

1225
01:39:50,393 --> 01:39:53,594
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have PlayStation Plus, it's worth it.

1226
01:39:55,415 --> 01:39:57,616
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the first round of...

1227
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:27,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Grand Theft Auto online jobs these are created with the new deathmatch and race online creation tools that they released I think literally a week or so ago and so these are now Rockstar verified jobs they have basically picked six races and four deathmatches that now be kind of appearing everywhere online like the official Rockstar matches and so that's kind of cool and they actually do have a system in there

1228
01:40:28,343 --> 01:40:32,347
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it didn't bleed through, but tell me if I'm crazy, you two here in studio just heard that siren, didn't you?

1229
01:40:51,929 --> 01:40:53,050
[SPEAKER_02]: The siren?

1230
01:40:53,751 --> 01:40:58,076
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an emergency siren that just went hauling in three... Oh, in this neighborhood?

1231
01:40:58,116 --> 01:40:58,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't doubt it.

1232
01:40:59,538 --> 01:41:00,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just well-timed.

1233
01:41:02,261 --> 01:41:04,564
[SPEAKER_04]: A Grand Theft Auto story and the police are here?

1234
01:41:04,704 --> 01:41:05,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1235
01:41:06,241 --> 01:41:06,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1236
01:41:07,402 --> 01:41:07,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Works.

1237
01:41:08,343 --> 01:41:08,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1238
01:41:09,323 --> 01:41:11,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got a couple stories for you guys.

1239
01:41:11,325 --> 01:41:12,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Another story about Doom.

1240
01:41:12,546 --> 01:41:13,226
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with this?

1241
01:41:13,326 --> 01:41:16,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we're at Blast from the Past tonight with all this Doom story.

1242
01:41:16,609 --> 01:41:19,931
[SPEAKER_04]: But VXJasonXV, tell me if you've heard about this one.

1243
01:41:20,672 --> 01:41:29,538
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a mod for Doom that puts Resident Evil 4's Mercenaries mode within Doom.

1244
01:41:29,938 --> 01:41:30,399
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

1245
01:41:30,919 --> 01:41:34,081
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's actually a little video of this here that I'll play.

1246
01:41:34,501 --> 01:41:35,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jason.

1247
01:41:36,462 --> 01:41:38,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very loud.

1248
01:41:38,943 --> 01:41:43,705
[SPEAKER_04]: But you see them going through the menu here, and it's got the Resident Evil 4 stuff in there.

1249
01:41:43,725 --> 01:41:44,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Leon S. Kennedy.

1250
01:41:45,326 --> 01:41:47,567
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like you can play as different characters there, and Leon's one of them.

1251
01:41:51,723 --> 01:41:59,128
[SPEAKER_02]: and for the chatters and podcast listeners, you can go to youtube.com slash orange lounge radio and view the video that we were watching just now.

1252
01:41:59,148 --> 01:42:01,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the best radio, but the video will exist in a week.

1253
01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:08,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, so you can have this, you do need a copy of Doom and you have to have its multiplayer mods in order to run this mod.

1254
01:42:08,854 --> 01:42:10,555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only about 85% complete now.

1255
01:42:10,575 --> 01:42:12,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now we're finally getting into some gameplay there.

1256
01:42:12,717 --> 01:42:15,979
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh, that's a very recognizable Doom.

1257
01:42:16,059 --> 01:42:19,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like they took Doom and made it like over the shoulder.

1258
01:42:20,261 --> 01:42:20,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

1259
01:42:20,721 --> 01:42:21,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he did the neck breaker!

1260
01:42:22,082 --> 01:42:23,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very Resident Evil 4 style.

1261
01:42:24,203 --> 01:42:25,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah!

1262
01:42:25,304 --> 01:42:28,405
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the little, like, pop-ups that come up at the bottom there.

1263
01:42:29,305 --> 01:42:30,066
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

1264
01:42:30,726 --> 01:42:31,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1265
01:42:32,227 --> 01:42:36,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, he needs the multiplayer mods, and that's very awesome.

1266
01:42:37,829 --> 01:42:38,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can you check that out?

1267
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:39,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to...

1268
01:42:40,996 --> 01:42:41,836
[SPEAKER_02]: It's linked in this article.

1269
01:42:42,016 --> 01:42:44,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1270
01:42:44,837 --> 01:42:47,778
[SPEAKER_02]: That's almost as cool as... VigLink.com.

1271
01:42:47,838 --> 01:42:48,819
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like buried.

1272
01:42:48,999 --> 01:42:51,560
[SPEAKER_09]: That is almost as cool as ASCII Quake.

1273
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:55,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually just goes to Mediafire, so it's literally just like a no-name dump right now.

1274
01:42:55,801 --> 01:42:57,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, somebody's hosting site there.

1275
01:42:57,262 --> 01:43:01,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just Google Domero, D-O-O-M, Doom Arrow.

1276
01:43:02,003 --> 01:43:05,025
[SPEAKER_04]: D-O-O-M-E-R-O, and you can find his Ember Series mod.

1277
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:05,985
[SPEAKER_09]: That one's pretty cool.

1278
01:43:06,065 --> 01:43:09,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, my favorite Doom mod to this day is still Gatchaman Doom.

1279
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1280
01:43:11,781 --> 01:43:12,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, check that out.

1281
01:43:13,663 --> 01:43:13,964
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1282
01:43:14,805 --> 01:43:16,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a quick story here.

1283
01:43:16,727 --> 01:43:18,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy X-3.

1284
01:43:18,368 --> 01:43:19,329
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1285
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:20,070
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1286
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:22,953
[SPEAKER_04]: X, not X, not X-2, but X-3.

1287
01:43:23,414 --> 01:43:23,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1288
01:43:23,934 --> 01:43:24,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit down.

1289
01:43:24,795 --> 01:43:25,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Put your pants on.

1290
01:43:25,836 --> 01:43:26,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not confirmed.

1291
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:28,299
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that...

1292
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:32,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Kazushige Nojima Kazushige Nojima Kazushige Nojima

1293
01:43:51,919 --> 01:43:56,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I would personally like to see a sequel like X3.

1294
01:43:57,023 --> 01:44:03,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, we're gonna get a XIII with Lightning Returns, so it's... They just need to shut up and give us another VII or something.

1295
01:44:03,488 --> 01:44:05,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say the same thing.

1296
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:07,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my damn VII?

1297
01:44:07,732 --> 01:44:11,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a full immersive remake of VI.

1298
01:44:12,406 --> 01:44:17,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, if you want to show your support, March 18th is the big day when these games come out in North America.

1299
01:44:17,777 --> 01:44:21,344
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in Europe, you've got to wait just a couple more days, March 21st.

1300
01:44:21,544 --> 01:44:22,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So, check those out.

1301
01:44:23,548 --> 01:44:24,510
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1302
01:44:25,842 --> 01:44:27,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was just saying that my villager wants to kill Ed.

1303
01:44:27,863 --> 01:44:29,724
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a message in chat from... Who doesn't?

1304
01:44:32,045 --> 01:44:37,367
[SPEAKER_09]: They're talking about modding all the Doom stuff and then Tech2030 says, seriously, Animal Crossing mod where the villager shoots everything?

1305
01:44:37,867 --> 01:44:41,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, my villager wants to kill Ed because he won't leave my damn village.

1306
01:44:41,749 --> 01:44:42,289
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate Ed.

1307
01:44:42,449 --> 01:44:44,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've consistently hit him with bug nets.

1308
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:45,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm just ignoring him.

1309
01:44:46,391 --> 01:44:49,232
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had him almost fully ignored and then accidentally talked to him.

1310
01:44:49,352 --> 01:44:50,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been writing him hateful notes?

1311
01:44:50,853 --> 01:44:51,353
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't.

1312
01:44:51,853 --> 01:44:53,694
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want him to leave, you have to ignore him.

1313
01:44:54,054 --> 01:44:54,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

1314
01:44:55,171 --> 01:44:58,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, I just want to murder him with my shovel.

1315
01:44:59,513 --> 01:45:02,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Or embed the axe in his stupid horse head.

1316
01:45:02,775 --> 01:45:03,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And then bury him with the shovel.

1317
01:45:04,416 --> 01:45:05,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And see if he grows into an ed tree.

1318
01:45:06,677 --> 01:45:07,698
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

1319
01:45:08,598 --> 01:45:10,780
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not even worth being fertilizer, okay?

1320
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:12,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Or glue.

1321
01:45:12,544 --> 01:45:13,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Or glue.

1322
01:45:13,525 --> 01:45:14,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Or even food.

1323
01:45:14,705 --> 01:45:15,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Jell-O.

1324
01:45:15,885 --> 01:45:16,906
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to a dark place.

1325
01:45:16,946 --> 01:45:17,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

1326
01:45:17,326 --> 01:45:18,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Punch-Out!

1327
01:45:18,706 --> 01:45:19,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha ha!

1328
01:45:20,207 --> 01:45:21,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Uppercut, uppercut.

1329
01:45:22,728 --> 01:45:29,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Punch-Out is on Nintendo eShop for Wii U. And you can get it.

1330
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:32,791
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out in 1994 originally.

1331
01:45:33,331 --> 01:45:36,793
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came out on Virtual Console for the Wii in 2009.

1332
01:45:37,393 --> 01:45:40,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's going to be on...

1333
01:45:40,954 --> 01:45:42,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Virtual Console for $8.

1334
01:45:44,276 --> 01:45:45,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd buy that for a dollar.

1335
01:45:45,416 --> 01:45:45,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

1336
01:45:46,597 --> 01:45:49,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you bought it on Wii, then it will cost you just a dollar.

1337
01:45:49,418 --> 01:45:50,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I think $1.50 gets Super Nintendo.

1338
01:45:52,322 --> 01:46:01,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Also now for the PS3 people, there are two games coming out in Japan for PS3.

1339
01:46:01,107 --> 01:46:03,729
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going to be Raiden 4.

1340
01:46:03,969 --> 01:46:05,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I'm so happy.

1341
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:16,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to import that shit because I love... Dan and I were just listening to comparisons of the first Raiden game on different consoles, trying to listen to the music and stuff.

1342
01:46:16,796 --> 01:46:18,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Found some were really awful.

1343
01:46:19,158 --> 01:46:20,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know the Lynx version doesn't have any music?

1344
01:46:21,841 --> 01:46:22,641
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really terrible.

1345
01:46:23,582 --> 01:46:26,905
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other game coming out is Caladrius.

1346
01:46:27,846 --> 01:46:33,931
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, Raiden 4 is going to be Raiden Overkill, and then Caladrius is going to be out in 2014 as well.

1347
01:46:37,615 --> 01:46:43,260
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty, let's take a trip to our Fugle Question of the Week.

1348
01:46:50,731 --> 01:46:55,255
[SPEAKER_04]: You take Facebook and you take Google Plus and you slam them together and you get Boogle.

1349
01:46:55,676 --> 01:47:02,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go over to our Facebook and Google Plus communities where we're going to see some answers to our question, which is very simple this week.

1350
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:06,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a holiday show for the new year, the last show of the year.

1351
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:09,969
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is one very popular thing people like to do this time of year?

1352
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:13,693
[SPEAKER_04]: New Year's resolutions, which, you know, for better or worse, people do them.

1353
01:47:14,093 --> 01:47:16,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be using DVR as my interval training.

1354
01:47:35,367 --> 01:47:37,388
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of your resolution in a way.

1355
01:47:37,709 --> 01:47:46,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I hate to use my whole exercise thing as a resolution, but I want to use DDR and other physical games as part of my training regimen.

1356
01:47:46,595 --> 01:47:47,355
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fair enough.

1357
01:47:48,216 --> 01:47:50,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see what some of our listeners said.

1358
01:47:50,637 --> 01:47:55,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go over to Google+, where Actdeft said, Get a better gaming PC.

1359
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:59,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, getting an HDTV is one of my top gaming priorities.

1360
01:48:00,204 --> 01:48:04,687
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, like every year, my top resolution is finishing my massive backlog of games.

1361
01:48:06,107 --> 01:48:09,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment says, must accomplish project buy a house.

1362
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:13,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm assuming that's not an Animal Crossing reference, but it very well could be.

1363
01:48:13,452 --> 01:48:14,792
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also on my list, too.

1364
01:48:14,872 --> 01:48:17,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, now that I'm going to be working, Dan and I are buying a house.

1365
01:48:18,054 --> 01:48:21,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving to a nicer studio for OLR is definitely on top of my list.

1366
01:48:22,016 --> 01:48:24,158
[SPEAKER_09]: That could probably happen if we buy said house.

1367
01:48:24,518 --> 01:48:25,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it'll be a race.

1368
01:48:26,979 --> 01:48:30,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's go over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there.

1369
01:48:30,642 --> 01:48:33,785
[SPEAKER_04]: We had quite a few answers over there, but I'm in a good mood.

1370
01:48:33,805 --> 01:48:36,287
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have a lot of news tonight, so we should get through most of these.

1371
01:48:37,107 --> 01:48:39,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy R. says, Finish more of the games I buy.

1372
01:48:39,709 --> 01:48:41,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn Steam sales aren't helping.

1373
01:48:42,431 --> 01:48:51,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Critical Myths says resolve to finish Mass Effect 3, play the two Dragon Age games, and do even more Assassin's Creed cosplay.

1374
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:55,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Only finish Mass Effect 3 if you have the extended cut DLC downloaded and ready to go.

1375
01:48:56,044 --> 01:48:57,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it, if you have it.

1376
01:48:57,465 --> 01:49:00,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're like, but I want to see what it was like beforehand first.

1377
01:49:00,428 --> 01:49:00,628
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1378
01:49:01,569 --> 01:49:02,049
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to.

1379
01:49:02,169 --> 01:49:02,570
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't.

1380
01:49:03,143 --> 01:49:03,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I made that mistake.

1381
01:49:06,005 --> 01:49:09,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched them on the internet and I was like, download.

1382
01:49:10,328 --> 01:49:11,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1383
01:49:11,489 --> 01:49:14,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I waited to beat my game so I could download the extended cut.

1384
01:49:15,791 --> 01:49:16,292
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1385
01:49:16,912 --> 01:49:17,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1386
01:49:18,573 --> 01:49:19,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Going on to Fifth Dream.

1387
01:49:19,734 --> 01:49:26,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe in making resolutions because I don't keep them, but if I did, it would be to stop hoarding games like a squirrel and his nuts in winter.

1388
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:32,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously probably have more games right now than I've played only once or never than all the other games I've had in my life.

1389
01:49:32,646 --> 01:49:35,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, most cost $1.50 to $10, but still.

1390
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:36,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have that same problem.

1391
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:38,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Same problem.

1392
01:49:38,251 --> 01:49:41,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Degenerate Johnny says, I vow to catch them all this year.

1393
01:49:41,474 --> 01:49:42,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch what, you might ask?

1394
01:49:42,996 --> 01:49:44,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave it to your imagination.

1395
01:49:44,762 --> 01:49:47,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, you better have a good doctor.

1396
01:49:48,184 --> 01:49:50,445
[SPEAKER_04]: He means all the cards in Hearthstone, obviously.

1397
01:49:51,565 --> 01:49:58,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Tech2030 says, with a new Tales game and Tales HD re-release coming out next year, I want to go back and play through all the Tales of English releases.

1398
01:49:59,389 --> 01:50:03,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get to replay the ones I finished and finally get to play through the ones sitting in my backlog.

1399
01:50:04,191 --> 01:50:05,333
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Euros, isn't it?

1400
01:50:20,711 --> 01:50:21,452
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1401
01:50:43,127 --> 01:50:45,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest VIII Flashback to 3-4 years ago OLR

1402
01:51:05,749 --> 01:51:10,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually put the symbols in chat because they do look rather similar at a glance.

1403
01:51:10,353 --> 01:51:11,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, from far away too.

1404
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:18,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel S replied and said, My gaming resolution is to stick to my game and not just jump from game to game.

1405
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:18,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

1406
01:51:19,501 --> 01:51:22,683
[SPEAKER_04]: To do this, I vow to get at least three platinum trophies in 2014.

1407
01:51:25,442 --> 01:51:45,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Codeman responds and says I would really like to dive more into Final Fantasy 14 took a little while off and now everybody has multiple 50s and it's crazy I may have gotten my second 50 this week I would just like to be more involved with a free company and run dungeons more etc etc now just to find the time well you know what they say real life greater than games

1408
01:51:46,172 --> 01:51:47,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's been my thing.

1409
01:51:47,393 --> 01:51:48,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm still only 30.

1410
01:51:49,973 --> 01:51:53,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Clover, well, the good thing is that game has level syncing.

1411
01:51:53,694 --> 01:52:01,557
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Codeman and DarkSakura and anybody else in our free company, Omnigarsamer, just feel free to ask for help because everybody can level sync down and do stuff and it's still a challenge.

1412
01:52:01,657 --> 01:52:06,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get, if you have like a level 48 or 49 character, you get great XP from it still.

1413
01:52:06,838 --> 01:52:10,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually been using the level syncing a lot for doing Fates so that I can buy a stupid mount.

1414
01:52:12,082 --> 01:52:16,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to get up to the job level so that I could buy my mount.

1415
01:52:16,226 --> 01:52:18,207
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who else has been playing Final Fantasy XIV?

1416
01:52:18,448 --> 01:52:19,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf.

1417
01:52:19,368 --> 01:52:20,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf finally got into it.

1418
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:22,491
[SPEAKER_04]: He hasn't talked much about it, but he's playing.

1419
01:52:24,933 --> 01:52:28,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Clover Nikon says purchase a Playstation 4 the latter half of 2014.

1420
01:52:29,015 --> 01:52:31,917
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife and I both agree that any issues should be ironed out by them.

1421
01:52:32,078 --> 01:52:32,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

1422
01:52:33,298 --> 01:52:34,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get one too.

1423
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:35,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully a little sooner but we'll see.

1424
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:38,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator says I don't really do New Year's resolutions.

1425
01:52:38,282 --> 01:52:42,525
[SPEAKER_04]: The closest thing to that is what I've been doing all along since this past March.

1426
01:52:42,965 --> 01:52:46,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy more Steam games, preferably when they're on sale, and play more games.

1427
01:52:47,729 --> 01:53:00,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome Unicorn replied and said, My gaming resolution for 2014 is to ensure that no more than 50% of my playtime in Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII is spent recoloring and accessorizing Lightning's outfits.

1428
01:53:00,839 --> 01:53:02,740
[SPEAKER_04]: This will take all of my willpower.

1429
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:09,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that answer because the extras in Final Fantasy and how far they really go, that is such an appropriate answer.

1430
01:53:09,726 --> 01:53:09,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in

1431
01:53:10,106 --> 01:53:23,208
[SPEAKER_02]: any game I probably sat there longer creating my character in Saints Row 3 than I did actually playing it that first night I might be ashamed to say how much time I've killed in Super Mario 64 stretching Mario's face in weird ways

1432
01:53:24,926 --> 01:53:25,686
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the fun.

1433
01:53:26,407 --> 01:53:31,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Osfer replies and says, I must play Final Fantasy X HD or else I will probably cry.

1434
01:53:31,589 --> 01:53:35,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Also hoping that XV is released in 2014 after we've waited for so damn long.

1435
01:53:37,012 --> 01:53:42,494
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt is last and says, My gaming resolution is to actually make a classic gaming setup in my place.

1436
01:53:42,974 --> 01:53:48,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the bulk of my classic gaming stuff in boxes and have to keep swapping them out when I want to play anything.

1437
01:53:48,637 --> 01:53:51,478
[SPEAKER_04]: What I would like is a full and nicely organized setup.

1438
01:53:52,179 --> 01:53:52,619
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a...

1439
01:53:52,999 --> 01:53:55,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro N5?

1440
01:53:55,342 --> 01:53:56,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just Retro N?

1441
01:53:56,523 --> 01:53:57,304
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that thing called?

1442
01:53:57,424 --> 01:54:00,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it the Retron 5 just because I love Tron.

1443
01:54:01,728 --> 01:54:10,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's cheating, but considering what you have to do to get enough inputs for classic games like that, not to mention if you don't even have composite.

1444
01:54:10,937 --> 01:54:13,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And on top of that, a modern TV is going to have...

1445
01:54:16,526 --> 01:54:26,152
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that we did ours at the old house was that we had the switch boxes behind with these demo monitors that Dan got when Game Crazy closed.

1446
01:54:27,053 --> 01:54:33,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And with our switch boxes and the component in, we were just able to hit the box in the middle and we had everything out on one shelf.

1447
01:54:33,517 --> 01:54:43,925
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another guy who has his set up to where he used crates with LED lights at the top of each crate so that it would turn on whatever system was active.

1448
01:54:43,945 --> 01:54:44,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1449
01:54:44,805 --> 01:54:46,025
[SPEAKER_09]: and there's ways to do it.

1450
01:54:46,065 --> 01:54:54,348
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to get a little creative, but there are ways to organize it to where not only are your systems there ready to play, but they are also on display.

1451
01:54:54,408 --> 01:54:58,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little foolish for me to jump straight to the retro end because compatibility, if nothing else...

1452
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:29,265
[SPEAKER_02]: the HDMI, I mean like TigerClaw says in the chatroom, Retron 5 looks interesting the fact you can play your old games over HDMI that right there is so appealing to me just the cable space and everything I know it's not the same same but close enough I have, because of my emulation history and everything else, I would have no problem with something like that, not to mention I don't own those classic systems anymore I've given a lot of them away to various friends that don't need new gaming consoles and just want to play an old fun game

1453
01:55:29,985 --> 01:55:39,275
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I've helped them along with that not to mention the only system I owned before Playstation was an SNES but I have neither anymore you own one?

1454
01:55:40,356 --> 01:55:51,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have three or four well I think all my games went with it we have extras I am not in the mood to start scavenging and building up and paying for all those cartridges again

1455
01:55:52,569 --> 01:55:54,773
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually are probably going to be downsizing the vault, by the way.

1456
01:55:55,074 --> 01:55:55,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no.

1457
01:55:57,518 --> 01:55:58,760
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to move with all that stuff?

1458
01:55:59,161 --> 01:56:00,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1459
01:56:00,724 --> 01:56:03,008
[SPEAKER_09]: A good two-thirds of it is in storage at Dan's mom's house.

1460
01:56:04,471 --> 01:56:05,511
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1461
01:56:33,761 --> 01:56:39,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into some more news, and then we'll get into list lists and all that in just a little bit.

1462
01:56:40,143 --> 01:56:41,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you want to start us off?

1463
01:56:42,024 --> 01:56:51,907
[SPEAKER_12]: So, like most console games, now Battlefield 4 has been banned in China, and probably has a little bit to do with the China Rising expansion.

1464
01:56:52,607 --> 01:56:56,049
[SPEAKER_12]: They say that it was banned for national security reasons.

1465
01:56:57,269 --> 01:57:03,191
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know, maybe they just didn't like the view of China in that game.

1466
01:57:05,393 --> 01:57:16,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, do you think it's one of those games where EA might want to put out a different version to try, or just no, they're just going to write it off?

1467
01:57:17,377 --> 01:57:18,357
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're going to write it off.

1468
01:57:18,377 --> 01:57:19,298
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of think so, too.

1469
01:57:19,318 --> 01:57:28,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Because basically, the main problem with it is that they're saying that the campaign of that takes place, a Chinese admiral is planning to overthrow the government.

1470
01:57:29,041 --> 01:57:33,803
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that they really want to promote or glorify there.

1471
01:57:35,424 --> 01:57:36,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very true.

1472
01:57:36,884 --> 01:57:41,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Do games have similar scenarios with just the legit American government?

1473
01:57:42,166 --> 01:57:47,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually like you're taking down a terrorist faction that already did the deed of overthrowing the government.

1474
01:57:48,708 --> 01:57:51,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Or future post-apocalyptic, something like that.

1475
01:57:51,909 --> 01:57:54,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking like Modern Warfare 2 and 3, that kind of stuff.

1476
01:57:56,730 --> 01:58:05,153
[SPEAKER_12]: There's always some sort of corrupt government entity in any of these, especially a lot of the military first-person shooters and stuff.

1477
01:58:06,311 --> 01:58:15,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, always some kind of a nefarious, what's the word, ne'er-do-well that is the actual focal point of all of this kind of stuff.

1478
01:58:17,509 --> 01:58:19,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest X is an MMO game that exists on the Wii U.

1479
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,881
[SPEAKER_04]: but some people still talking about Dragon Quest XI.

1480
01:58:40,441 --> 01:58:46,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I guess there was some thought that Dragon Quest XI could be mobile, that it could end up being a mobile game.

1481
01:58:46,662 --> 01:58:53,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, after all, Square has been putting out more and more stuff on the iPhone, iPad, iOS system and Android and so forth.

1482
01:58:53,703 --> 01:58:56,643
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, what, Final Fantasy 3, 4, 5 are all there.

1483
01:58:56,983 --> 01:58:59,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 6 actually just is coming out or just came out.

1484
01:59:00,404 --> 01:59:05,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of stopped downloading all those because they're a little bit pricey and, you know, they're not as good as the originals.

1485
01:59:06,005 --> 01:59:33,453
[SPEAKER_04]: but some folks thinking that Dragon Quest XI might go that way but Square Enix mobile developer Takehiro Ando would like to clarify some things in a Fumitsu column saying quote at the current stage there are no talks about making Dragon Quest XI for smartphones I believe there's still plenty left to overcome before we release a proper sequel for smartphones so we don't know when Dragon Quest XI will be out or what system it will be on I would

1486
01:59:33,993 --> 01:59:41,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine it nearly matches the experience of Dragon Quest X on like Wii U or something, but then again, you'd be surprised.

1487
02:00:01,853 --> 02:00:04,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It was originally on Wii, now that I think about it.

1488
02:00:04,254 --> 02:00:05,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U was like a special version.

1489
02:00:05,234 --> 02:00:06,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It was originally on Wii.

1490
02:00:06,475 --> 02:00:08,735
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be surprised how well some of this stuff can do mobily.

1491
02:00:09,696 --> 02:00:15,938
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a fair number of MOBAs and MMOs and they find ways of making it work.

1492
02:00:16,058 --> 02:00:20,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Input schemes that people are willing to put up with to play on their favorite franchise.

1493
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:23,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1494
02:00:24,696 --> 02:00:25,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1495
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:50,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the collection is including the Atari 2600, the ColecoVision, but the games don't yet have sound, however they will.

1496
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:55,252
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, the BBC is covering this now because the archive apparently is expanding.

1497
02:00:57,433 --> 02:00:57,654
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

1498
02:00:58,054 --> 02:00:58,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1499
02:00:59,035 --> 02:01:00,676
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of cool stuff can I play in there?

1500
02:01:01,997 --> 02:01:02,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, um...

1501
02:01:04,702 --> 02:01:09,563
[SPEAKER_09]: The worry is that some of these are going to be illegal because they're ROMs.

1502
02:01:09,743 --> 02:01:10,984
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to have the emulator to play them.

1503
02:01:12,584 --> 02:01:20,906
[SPEAKER_09]: But the much older games are supposed to be available for legal play and it's not actually listing a specific type.

1504
02:01:20,986 --> 02:01:21,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, there we go.

1505
02:01:21,606 --> 02:01:23,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Frogger are in the archives.

1506
02:01:24,487 --> 02:01:32,249
[SPEAKER_09]: They are also including Atari 7800, Magnavox Odyssey, which in Europe was the Philips VideoPak G7000, and the Astrocade.

1507
02:01:33,269 --> 02:01:33,369
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1508
02:01:34,943 --> 02:01:35,183
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1509
02:01:35,423 --> 02:01:36,664
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1510
02:01:36,684 --> 02:01:37,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's expanded.

1511
02:01:38,845 --> 02:01:48,651
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, from the classics to the future, you guys, it's time to predict 2014 in a segment we call here at Orange Lounge Radio, Listless!

1512
02:01:51,886 --> 02:02:00,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and of course, as the show where every gamer has a voice, you guys listening live play an important role in the listless process.

1513
02:02:00,572 --> 02:02:04,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So head on over to live.vognetwork.com so you can play along with us.

1514
02:02:05,195 --> 02:02:12,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you listening on the podcast, I'm sorry we don't yet have the functionality for the podcast listeners to participate to, but that is something we are working on for 2014.

1515
02:02:12,681 --> 02:02:16,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So listen along and have fun with us as we predict tonight's question...

1516
02:02:18,484 --> 02:02:20,805
[SPEAKER_04]: What will happen in gaming in 2014?

1517
02:02:21,386 --> 02:02:24,127
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your gaming predictions for 2014?

1518
02:02:24,467 --> 02:02:35,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Now to take a walk down memory lane real quick, let me see if I can pull this up real quick because we actually have, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's an Orange Lounge Radio Wikia.

1519
02:02:35,652 --> 02:02:35,972
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1520
02:02:53,032 --> 02:02:54,552
[SPEAKER_04]: On this show, what is the inside joke?

1521
02:02:55,113 --> 02:03:00,474
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check that out, orangeloungeradio.wikia.com Midna found the ferret, by the way Did she?

1522
02:03:00,754 --> 02:03:21,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes Well, one of the pages there on the wikia is listless And it tells you every definitive list we've ever come up with here on Orange Lounge Radio Because this is a process where we will come up with the definitive list And so last year, at this time, we did 2013 predictions So shall I remind you about what we predicted for 2013?

1523
02:03:22,841 --> 02:03:24,362
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Lube is $100 with Commitment

1524
02:03:54,588 --> 02:03:58,993
[SPEAKER_04]: A Vita price drop before the first anniversary, which that did happen, right?

1525
02:03:59,173 --> 02:03:59,754
[SPEAKER_04]: That did happen.

1526
02:04:00,074 --> 02:04:02,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.

1527
02:04:02,257 --> 02:04:03,498
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were one for four.

1528
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:04,860
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

1529
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:08,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of the Xbox loop being $100 worth of commitment, it's $100 more with dementia and brainwashing.

1530
02:04:11,727 --> 02:04:17,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there's the voice of Alan Alchemy who's going to be sitting in on Listless with us tonight.

1531
02:04:17,095 --> 02:04:17,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Alan.

1532
02:04:17,535 --> 02:04:17,856
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

1533
02:04:18,296 --> 02:04:18,497
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1534
02:04:18,917 --> 02:04:20,159
[SPEAKER_04]: What a good introduction there.

1535
02:04:20,419 --> 02:04:20,620
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1536
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:26,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to fade the music there a little earlier because I don't want YouTube saying, oh, oh, you don't own that song.

1537
02:04:27,109 --> 02:04:27,650
[SPEAKER_04]: So there we go.

1538
02:04:28,110 --> 02:04:29,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, getting into listless night.

1539
02:04:29,452 --> 02:04:34,681
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that have never heard listless before, it is a very scientific process.

1540
02:04:34,701 --> 02:04:36,684
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no arguing people with this list.

1541
02:04:37,745 --> 02:04:42,373
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the list of predictions for 2014, the official gaming community predictions.

1542
02:04:43,354 --> 02:04:44,495
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1543
02:05:07,054 --> 02:05:08,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's put it up on the board.

1544
02:05:08,274 --> 02:05:11,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go over at live.vognetwork.com.

1545
02:05:11,436 --> 02:05:14,016
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your gaming predictions for 2014?

1546
02:05:14,377 --> 02:05:24,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Participating tonight with us, of course, DarkSakura, Loki, VXJasonXV, the voice of the show, myself, and Alan Alchemy, as you just heard there a minute ago.

1547
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:25,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, how are you, Alan?

1548
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:26,521
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been playing these days?

1549
02:05:26,721 --> 02:05:28,961
[SPEAKER_04]: What does a gaming week look like for you these days?

1550
02:05:29,181 --> 02:05:30,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of Final Fantasy XIV.

1551
02:05:30,842 --> 02:05:31,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

1552
02:05:31,942 --> 02:05:33,683
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been accomplishing in that game?

1553
02:05:34,495 --> 02:05:35,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on my relic.

1554
02:05:36,678 --> 02:05:37,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Working on your relic?

1555
02:05:37,659 --> 02:05:39,040
[SPEAKER_04]: His big number has been getting bigger.

1556
02:05:39,261 --> 02:05:39,721
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1557
02:05:39,781 --> 02:05:40,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Big number's getting bigger.

1558
02:05:41,363 --> 02:05:42,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster's getting bigger.

1559
02:05:42,324 --> 02:05:43,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Fight's getting crazier.

1560
02:05:43,745 --> 02:05:43,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1561
02:05:45,182 --> 02:05:45,402
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1562
02:06:10,498 --> 02:06:14,200
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your number three pick for gaming prediction for 2014?

1563
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:16,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Serious or silly, whatever you want.

1564
02:06:17,061 --> 02:06:19,722
[SPEAKER_09]: World of Warcraft loses over a million subscribers over the course of 2014.

1565
02:06:21,063 --> 02:06:23,004
[SPEAKER_04]: So WoW loses a million more.

1566
02:06:23,944 --> 02:06:24,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Over.

1567
02:06:24,204 --> 02:06:27,506
[SPEAKER_09]: A minimum of a million subscribers over the course of 2014.

1568
02:06:28,306 --> 02:06:30,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so why do you say that?

1569
02:06:31,427 --> 02:06:32,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's shit.

1570
02:06:36,225 --> 02:06:48,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I still like WoW I just don't think the new expansion even with as much as it kind of had me excited I don't think it's enough to save it it's too little too late they're just throwing bones now

1571
02:06:49,632 --> 02:07:07,545
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah they may get a few lore nerds back and happy and I'm a lore nerd I liked I how many of those books are on my shelves you know and I would probably you know play for a week to see the content and then quit again so it's just not enough for me

1572
02:07:08,012 --> 02:07:11,455
[SPEAKER_04]: After Mario Kart 8 fails to sell enough consoles for Nintendo, they will finally drop the price.

1573
02:07:34,209 --> 02:07:37,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mario Kart 8 is going to do fucking fantastic, but I think a price drop is going to happen.

1574
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:38,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's my thing too.

1575
02:07:38,370 --> 02:07:40,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think Mario Kart 8 is going to do really well.

1576
02:07:40,571 --> 02:07:41,671
[SPEAKER_02]: But why do you think it's going to fail?

1577
02:07:41,691 --> 02:07:45,993
[SPEAKER_04]: You just think it's going to fail because there's not going to be the Wii U's out there or whatever?

1578
02:07:58,634 --> 02:08:04,037
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it can still be a good game, but it's just not going to be enough for people to buy the console for.

1579
02:08:04,077 --> 02:08:10,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, some people might, but it's just not going to be enough to make a huge enough difference to where all of a sudden it's going to be a 3DS.

1580
02:08:12,046 --> 02:08:15,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a good thing we have an elimination round.

1581
02:08:15,389 --> 02:08:20,372
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, am I being meaner by saying that it's going to drop anyways as compared to Loki?

1582
02:08:21,113 --> 02:08:23,014
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because I do think it will drop in price.

1583
02:08:23,054 --> 02:08:25,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all the consoles will drop in price next holiday.

1584
02:08:25,416 --> 02:08:25,956
[SPEAKER_04]: They all will.

1585
02:08:26,136 --> 02:08:27,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Wii U will be two years old next year.

1586
02:08:27,757 --> 02:08:28,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but we'll see.

1587
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:29,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

1588
02:08:29,979 --> 02:08:31,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put it on the board anyway.

1589
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:34,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 fails, Wii U price dropped.

1590
02:08:34,722 --> 02:08:39,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, I know you just said he jacked one of your answers, but I've got to pick on you now.

1591
02:08:39,906 --> 02:08:41,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three, what's your number three answer?

1592
02:08:41,727 --> 02:08:43,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Half-Life 3?

1593
02:08:43,431 --> 02:08:44,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Question mark?

1594
02:08:44,493 --> 02:08:45,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Smiley face?

1595
02:08:45,595 --> 02:08:46,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Frowny face?

1596
02:08:46,597 --> 02:08:47,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Won't get released

1597
02:08:51,994 --> 02:08:55,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Half-Life 3, question mark, smiley face, won't get released.

1598
02:08:56,178 --> 02:09:06,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Won't get released, which is kind of vague because that allows for an announcement or do you think 2014 is going to be a complete information void toilet for Half-Life 3 still?

1599
02:09:06,748 --> 02:09:07,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it already has been.

1600
02:09:08,931 --> 02:09:10,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Hasn't it always been?

1601
02:09:11,813 --> 02:09:16,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect it to change, but I'm going to stick squarely with no Half-Life 3.

1602
02:09:17,618 --> 02:09:44,303
[SPEAKER_04]: so there it is up on the board Half-Life 3 won't get released up on the board next to duh and of course alright I'm just kidding alright alright my number three answer I'll go next with my number three answer my number three answer and I know I'm gonna have like two of you guys going god damn it that's what I picked my number three answer is Ouya goes under Ouya calls it a day I just I

1603
02:09:45,263 --> 02:09:46,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's... You went there?

1604
02:09:47,125 --> 02:09:58,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I went there, I'm sorry, but it's just one of those things that had a huge fanfare and now it's kind of went... And, you know, I realize they're doing great things for indies and all that, but I just... But OUYA 2, Rob, OUYA 2.

1605
02:09:58,517 --> 02:10:00,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OUYA 2 soon, so...

1606
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:03,041
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1607
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:27,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, they're going to lose a million subs, and then they're going to fail and you're still not going to get your damn game, and then the company's going to go under.

1608
02:10:27,786 --> 02:10:32,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Alan, maybe you have a cheerful number three answer, or maybe you don't, but what is your number three answer?

1609
02:10:33,250 --> 02:10:42,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, you pointing that out made me think of something really dark and grim that I wasn't going to say previously, so whether or not I say it is... Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!

1610
02:10:42,878 --> 02:10:43,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants Alan to go there?

1611
02:10:44,339 --> 02:10:47,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Go there, go there, go there!

1612
02:10:47,641 --> 02:10:51,263
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the big Nintendo godfathers of gaming will pass away.

1613
02:10:52,323 --> 02:10:52,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

1614
02:10:53,084 --> 02:10:54,444
[SPEAKER_04]: That is too soon.

1615
02:10:54,724 --> 02:10:55,325
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1616
02:10:55,445 --> 02:10:56,365
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't say that.

1617
02:10:56,405 --> 02:10:57,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, he can.

1618
02:10:57,465 --> 02:10:59,086
[SPEAKER_11]: The Zelda Mario dude.

1619
02:10:59,846 --> 02:11:00,227
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them.

1620
02:11:00,287 --> 02:11:01,147
[SPEAKER_11]: The Final Fantasy.

1621
02:11:01,327 --> 02:11:02,808
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the big 8-bit godfathers.

1622
02:11:02,828 --> 02:11:04,549
[SPEAKER_04]: You are awful and you should feel awful.

1623
02:11:04,589 --> 02:11:07,150
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all like pushing 70, right?

1624
02:11:07,410 --> 02:11:08,830
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not very old anymore.

1625
02:11:09,251 --> 02:11:11,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's true, but people fall downstairs every day.

1626
02:11:13,833 --> 02:11:19,077
[SPEAKER_09]: This is supposed to be a funny segment, you guys!

1627
02:11:20,118 --> 02:11:22,119
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't have thought of it if you didn't point it out.

1628
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:27,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna need everybody to eliminate number three answers.

1629
02:11:27,964 --> 02:11:32,247
[SPEAKER_12]: But wouldn't falling down stairs be kind of ironic in the whole Paul Walker ironic?

1630
02:11:32,307 --> 02:11:37,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, they do have to climb stairs at the very end of each Mario level to jump on the goalposts.

1631
02:11:38,064 --> 02:11:43,425
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it would be ironic if he gets kidnapped by a monkey and taken to the top of a skyrise.

1632
02:11:43,505 --> 02:11:44,586
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be ironic.

1633
02:11:47,006 --> 02:11:47,406
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1634
02:11:48,087 --> 02:11:48,447
Wow.

1635
02:11:49,067 --> 02:11:54,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to need us all to – let's try to make it a little bit happier going to number two, and then we'll just eliminate all the threes.

1636
02:11:54,248 --> 02:11:54,548
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1637
02:11:55,528 --> 02:11:56,008
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1638
02:11:56,069 --> 02:11:56,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try again.

1639
02:11:56,949 --> 02:12:00,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Your number two – so far, since I have to read it anyway, the super dark 2014 –

1640
02:12:02,330 --> 02:12:03,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming Crash, number two predictions list.

1641
02:12:04,591 --> 02:12:06,051
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW loses a million subs over the year.

1642
02:12:06,151 --> 02:12:07,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 fails.

1643
02:12:07,232 --> 02:12:07,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U price drop.

1644
02:12:08,212 --> 02:12:09,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Half-Life 3 won't get released.

1645
02:12:09,633 --> 02:12:12,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouya goes under and 8-bit Godfather passes.

1646
02:12:12,533 --> 02:12:12,874
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1647
02:12:13,914 --> 02:12:15,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go on to the number two.

1648
02:12:15,414 --> 02:12:16,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy, shiny answers.

1649
02:12:16,755 --> 02:12:17,455
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1650
02:12:17,655 --> 02:12:18,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop influencing me.

1651
02:12:18,636 --> 02:12:18,916
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1652
02:12:19,336 --> 02:12:21,036
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is your number two answer?

1653
02:12:21,176 --> 02:12:25,898
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be another huge shipping war on Tumblr based on screenshots for the next Mass Effect.

1654
02:12:28,783 --> 02:12:30,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And remind us if you do not know what shipping means.

1655
02:12:37,771 --> 02:13:04,344
[SPEAKER_09]: relationships people fucking because it's fan driven there's a big annoyance I have with just oh these two characters are friends they're fucking no they might not be fucking but no it's basically the shipping is going to happen based on screen captures people are going to make assumptions Tumblr is going to piss themselves and ship all the things

1656
02:13:05,427 --> 02:13:09,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura's number two answer, the internet will exist, is up on the board.

1657
02:13:09,871 --> 02:13:10,511
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1658
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:13,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Rule 34 will continue its stride.

1659
02:13:13,654 --> 02:13:15,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Mass Effect 4 will be shipped before it ships.

1660
02:13:15,676 --> 02:13:18,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

1661
02:13:18,478 --> 02:13:23,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I should really change that to say new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

1662
02:13:23,942 --> 02:13:26,144
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll change that answer a little bit there and alter that on the board.

1663
02:13:26,905 --> 02:13:27,205
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1664
02:13:27,785 --> 02:13:30,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, dare I ask, your number two answer.

1665
02:13:31,693 --> 02:13:33,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually don't have a negative one this time.

1666
02:13:33,756 --> 02:13:39,926
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 will be out next year.

1667
02:13:43,257 --> 02:13:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

1668
02:13:43,717 --> 02:13:47,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 makes its way out next year.

1669
02:13:47,961 --> 02:13:48,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems logical.

1670
02:13:48,842 --> 02:13:55,287
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be really weird when L4D4, Left 4 Dead 4 comes out just because numbers.

1671
02:13:55,707 --> 02:14:03,874
[SPEAKER_12]: The thought was because when they announced Portal 2 they made Portal 1 free to download temporarily.

1672
02:14:04,434 --> 02:14:10,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Same with Left 4 Dead 2 just happened where they made it free for a day just to build up the user base of it.

1673
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:11,100
[SPEAKER_12]: So

1674
02:14:11,843 --> 02:14:13,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Most likely an announcement will be coming soon for that.

1675
02:14:15,265 --> 02:14:27,753
[SPEAKER_11]: I've theorized previously that Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 running for a year will be the testing, putting the toe in the water that Valve needs to make any sort of announcement on Half-Life 3.

1676
02:14:27,933 --> 02:14:29,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope!

1677
02:14:29,994 --> 02:14:30,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Announcement?

1678
02:14:32,416 --> 02:14:33,397
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have that conversation.

1679
02:14:33,417 --> 02:14:34,518
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's not even an entry.

1680
02:14:34,678 --> 02:14:36,120
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just... No, that's fine.

1681
02:14:36,140 --> 02:14:36,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1682
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:37,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, it's not your turn.

1683
02:14:39,122 --> 02:14:40,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, what is your number two answer?

1684
02:14:40,844 --> 02:14:42,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm personally ready for L4D20.

1685
02:14:43,806 --> 02:14:44,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1686
02:14:44,327 --> 02:14:44,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

1687
02:14:45,968 --> 02:14:48,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Oculus Rift released 4K resolution.

1688
02:14:51,313 --> 02:14:53,435
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to their current expectation, which is...

1689
02:14:55,448 --> 02:15:05,556
[SPEAKER_04]: 128800?

1690
02:14:55,588 --> 02:15:05,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gonna say, we know Oculus Rift is coming, but you say Oculus Rift is gonna, it's gonna They're gonna blow something away with resolution and quality and not just current expectations.

1691
02:15:05,576 --> 02:15:07,338
[SPEAKER_04]: It is real fucking life, y'all.

1692
02:15:07,358 --> 02:15:07,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

1693
02:15:08,078 --> 02:15:09,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Oculus Rift, real fucking life.

1694
02:15:10,660 --> 02:15:11,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

1695
02:15:11,481 --> 02:15:13,162
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is, up on the board.

1696
02:15:13,903 --> 02:15:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that is so funny that you bring up the Oculus Rift, and it is really funny because also in chat we had SSJ100Matt says, one of the big three will announce an Oculus Rift type of device.

1697
02:15:23,290 --> 02:15:29,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, funny enough, I swear I had this written before the show tonight, but my number two answer, Microsoft jacks the Rift.

1698
02:15:30,896 --> 02:15:32,757
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Microsoft love to do?

1699
02:15:32,958 --> 02:15:38,402
[SPEAKER_04]: They are going to take an idea that's popular in gaming and improve on it best they can.

1700
02:15:38,542 --> 02:15:40,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I fully expect Microsoft to jack the Rift.

1701
02:15:40,643 --> 02:15:42,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure improve is the case either.

1702
02:15:42,485 --> 02:15:44,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not buy Oculus Rift?

1703
02:15:44,766 --> 02:15:48,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Because for Microsoft to fit that MO perfectly, they usually absorb

1704
02:15:48,849 --> 02:15:50,030
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1705
02:16:18,507 --> 02:16:22,108
[SPEAKER_04]: But Microsoft jacks the rift is my number two answer, and I'm putting it up on the board.

1706
02:16:22,168 --> 02:16:22,448
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1707
02:16:23,529 --> 02:16:27,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Alchemy, last but not least, with your number two answer.

1708
02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:38,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo finally brings DS, not 3DS, but DS ROMs to a store on the Wii U. And somehow they make it disappointing.

1709
02:16:42,092 --> 02:16:45,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I love how you had to tack on the, and it's disappointing, just to keep it down.

1710
02:16:45,615 --> 02:16:53,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether it be the price, or the games that they actually announce for it, or how it plays, they'll do it and it'll somehow still be stupid.

1711
02:16:54,382 --> 02:16:56,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, again, another dark answer tonight.

1712
02:16:56,864 --> 02:17:00,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints.

1713
02:17:01,468 --> 02:17:02,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Womp womp.

1714
02:17:02,729 --> 02:17:04,610
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there it is, your number two answer.

1715
02:17:04,650 --> 02:17:07,231
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's run through the board real quick.

1716
02:17:07,612 --> 02:17:09,793
[SPEAKER_04]: We have new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

1717
02:17:09,853 --> 02:17:11,354
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW loses a million subs over the year.

1718
02:17:11,694 --> 02:17:13,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 is out.

1719
02:17:13,255 --> 02:17:15,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 fails and the Wii U price has dropped.

1720
02:17:15,696 --> 02:17:17,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Oculus Rift released in 4K resolution.

1721
02:17:17,997 --> 02:17:19,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Half-Life 3 won't get released.

1722
02:17:19,758 --> 02:17:20,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft jacks the Rift.

1723
02:17:20,999 --> 02:17:21,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouya goes under.

1724
02:17:21,899 --> 02:17:24,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints.

1725
02:17:24,701 --> 02:17:36,465
[SPEAKER_04]: 8-Bit Godfather Passes Alright, now it is time for the number one answer The thing you most predict for 2014 DarkSakura, what is your number one prediction?

1726
02:17:40,386 --> 02:17:52,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually been drawing a blank the entire time I mean, so I am going to say that an innovation within the video game industry leads to new advances for people with disabilities

1727
02:17:57,395 --> 02:18:00,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Like maybe Vision for the Blind.

1728
02:18:00,397 --> 02:18:03,998
[SPEAKER_09]: They're already working on bionic ocular implants.

1729
02:18:04,599 --> 02:18:06,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are a legit thing now.

1730
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:10,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're working on bionic oculus rift plans.

1731
02:18:13,111 --> 02:18:15,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to knock this shit off real fast.

1732
02:18:15,593 --> 02:18:16,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1733
02:18:16,174 --> 02:18:20,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So an unknown innovation in the video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

1734
02:18:20,258 --> 02:18:22,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to shorten that a little bit.

1735
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:23,381
[SPEAKER_09]: We're already seeing it happen.

1736
02:18:23,841 --> 02:18:28,166
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that something really big is going to happen that's going to turn around a lot of the negative press.

1737
02:18:28,766 --> 02:18:29,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope.

1738
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:31,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, did you have something to add to that?

1739
02:18:33,095 --> 02:18:35,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I was just telling Jason to stop it.

1740
02:18:37,779 --> 02:18:40,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, shut them up with your number one answer, Loki.

1741
02:18:40,521 --> 02:18:42,742
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the number one prediction for 2014?

1742
02:18:43,703 --> 02:18:52,469
[SPEAKER_12]: I've only been saying this the entire year, but I'm hoping that they'll do this because they'll definitely beef up what they have available for the system.

1743
02:18:53,790 --> 02:19:02,557
[SPEAKER_12]: 3DS games on the Wii U using the gamepad as the bottom screen, TV as the top screen.

1744
02:19:04,161 --> 02:19:11,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to just one-up what Alan said and say 3DS games on the Wii U. Well, I've been saying it all year long.

1745
02:19:12,003 --> 02:19:13,904
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an inevitability.

1746
02:19:14,644 --> 02:19:15,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1747
02:19:15,404 --> 02:19:16,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you can put what he wants.

1748
02:19:16,485 --> 02:19:16,785
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

1749
02:19:16,865 --> 02:19:21,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's up on the board with 3DS games on the Wii U. He did leave out the point, though, that it disappoints.

1750
02:19:21,386 --> 02:19:22,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for what it's worth.

1751
02:19:22,426 --> 02:19:22,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is.

1752
02:19:23,627 --> 02:19:24,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so there it is.

1753
02:19:24,567 --> 02:19:25,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's number one answer.

1754
02:19:25,607 --> 02:19:26,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, we're over to you.

1755
02:19:26,527 --> 02:19:28,288
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your number one prediction?

1756
02:19:28,888 --> 02:19:30,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Jesus.

1757
02:19:31,349 --> 02:19:31,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1758
02:19:34,125 --> 02:19:45,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go with indie game released to such fanfare they get signed on to a major publisher for a AAA release.

1759
02:19:46,088 --> 02:19:53,230
[SPEAKER_02]: The release doesn't have to happen, but the groundswell and fanfare has to happen in 2014.

1760
02:19:53,830 --> 02:19:59,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Indie game signed on to produce AAA port of same game.

1761
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:06,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to shorten that to say Indie goes from Indie to AAA in the scope of a year.

1762
02:20:07,891 --> 02:20:08,151
[SPEAKER_10]: It works.

1763
02:20:08,371 --> 02:20:08,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

1764
02:20:09,312 --> 02:20:11,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say Indie Game and put that on the board.

1765
02:20:11,972 --> 02:20:14,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Any idea what that type of game could be?

1766
02:20:16,693 --> 02:20:17,193
[SPEAKER_02]: A good one.

1767
02:20:17,213 --> 02:20:18,434
[SPEAKER_02]: If you knew it, you'd be a millionaire.

1768
02:20:18,454 --> 02:20:18,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1769
02:20:19,634 --> 02:20:19,894
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1770
02:20:19,914 --> 02:20:20,674
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be a millionaire.

1771
02:20:20,834 --> 02:20:21,174
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1772
02:20:22,074 --> 02:20:24,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Bochikawa says, so like what happened with Portal?

1773
02:20:25,175 --> 02:20:26,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that, right?

1774
02:20:27,676 --> 02:20:30,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that actually was kind of it because it was that Narbacular Drop.

1775
02:20:32,977 --> 02:20:34,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my number one answer.

1776
02:20:35,457 --> 02:20:35,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

1777
02:20:35,898 --> 02:20:36,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a long one.

1778
02:20:36,618 --> 02:20:38,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how I'm going to shorten this for the board, but here it is.

1779
02:20:38,458 --> 02:20:39,298
[SPEAKER_04]: My number one answer.

1780
02:20:40,879 --> 02:20:46,560
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2014, the year of Captain Falcon, F-Zero U is announced.

1781
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:50,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the greatest game ever made and Wii U haters can shove it.

1782
02:20:51,906 --> 02:21:09,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Falcon Punch That is my number one answer, Falcon Punch F-Zero Boner Party That's how you condense that down That works, Nintendo's Year of Captain Falcon That's what they're going to call it, F-Zero Boner Party Nintendo's Year of Falcon Punch Nintendo's Year of Falcon Boner

1783
02:21:12,265 --> 02:21:13,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I will accept that shortening.

1784
02:21:13,746 --> 02:21:17,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

1785
02:21:17,827 --> 02:21:18,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough, I like it.

1786
02:21:19,027 --> 02:21:21,468
[SPEAKER_04]: It is up on the board as my number one answer.

1787
02:21:21,908 --> 02:21:27,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that means we are down to one more prediction to go up on the board.

1788
02:21:27,990 --> 02:21:30,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Just before we hear Alan's answer, some of the things we see in chat.

1789
02:21:31,352 --> 02:21:58,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Tech2030 says Nintendo comes out with a 3DS player peripheral for the Wii U Fifth Dream says a Final Fantasy XIV expansion GameGuru says 2014 the year we predict disappointments in gaming Tigerclaw says in 2014 Gabe Newell will announce the release date for the Half-Life movie Degenerate Johnny says Nintendo pulls a Disney and starts buying up purchasable third-party LPs or IPs maybe

1790
02:22:01,913 --> 02:22:03,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was saying Let's Plays.

1791
02:22:03,554 --> 02:22:04,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Let's Plays.

1792
02:22:04,996 --> 02:22:05,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got it.

1793
02:22:05,576 --> 02:22:05,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.

1794
02:22:06,658 --> 02:22:09,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Degenerate Johnny says Hearthstone will remain in beta throughout the whole year.

1795
02:22:09,681 --> 02:22:11,202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a womp womp.

1796
02:22:11,723 --> 02:22:12,083
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1797
02:22:12,383 --> 02:22:13,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked SSJ 100 Nets.

1798
02:22:13,244 --> 02:22:14,025
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that one?

1799
02:22:14,345 --> 02:22:16,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get thrown out next year.

1800
02:22:16,848 --> 02:22:17,989
[SPEAKER_02]: You already got thrown out last week.

1801
02:22:18,009 --> 02:22:18,850
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I said.

1802
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:19,270
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1803
02:22:19,610 --> 02:22:21,252
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can happen again in 2014.

1804
02:22:21,412 --> 02:22:23,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, there is one spot left on the list.

1805
02:22:23,674 --> 02:22:25,116
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you put in there as your number one prediction?

1806
02:22:25,504 --> 02:22:35,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Bethesda confirms and gives an ETA for either the next campaign Elder Scrolls game or Fallout 4 That's too wide of a net Which one?

1807
02:22:36,956 --> 02:22:43,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Fallout 4 We've been waiting longer for that So Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 And gives an ETA And gives an ETA

1808
02:22:45,199 --> 02:22:47,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there an article about that in the last week or two?

1809
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:49,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds awfully familiar.

1810
02:22:49,321 --> 02:22:50,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be probably out in October.

1811
02:22:50,862 --> 02:22:51,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1812
02:22:51,442 --> 02:22:52,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that's a guy.

1813
02:22:52,182 --> 02:22:53,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's an E3 given.

1814
02:22:53,463 --> 02:22:53,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1815
02:22:54,023 --> 02:22:54,864
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1816
02:22:55,064 --> 02:22:55,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1817
02:22:55,284 --> 02:22:55,504
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1818
02:22:55,804 --> 02:22:56,344
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is.

1819
02:22:57,065 --> 02:22:57,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, you guys.

1820
02:22:57,925 --> 02:22:59,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what the board says right now.

1821
02:23:00,126 --> 02:23:02,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

1822
02:23:03,268 --> 02:23:05,168
[SPEAKER_04]: New Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

1823
02:23:05,529 --> 02:23:07,790
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW loses 1 million subs over the year.

1824
02:23:07,810 --> 02:23:10,611
[SPEAKER_04]: 3DS games on the Wii U. Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.

1825
02:23:10,911 --> 02:23:13,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 fails and Wii U prices dropped.

1826
02:23:14,312 --> 02:23:16,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Indie game goes from Indie to AAA in the scope of a year.

1827
02:23:17,013 --> 02:23:19,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Oculus Rift released with a 4K resolution.

1828
02:23:19,393 --> 02:23:21,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Half-Life 3 won't get released.

1829
02:23:21,494 --> 02:23:24,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

1830
02:23:24,975 --> 02:23:26,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft jacks the Rift.

1831
02:23:26,635 --> 02:23:27,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouya goes under.

1832
02:23:27,616 --> 02:23:29,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives ETA.

1833
02:23:30,076 --> 02:23:33,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints.

1834
02:23:33,597 --> 02:23:35,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And 8-bit Godfather passes.

1835
02:23:35,958 --> 02:23:37,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a name for Microsoft's Rift.

1836
02:23:37,718 --> 02:23:37,959
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1837
02:23:38,039 --> 02:23:38,559
[SPEAKER_02]: The Jacked.

1838
02:23:39,099 --> 02:23:39,399
What?

1839
02:23:40,019 --> 02:23:40,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Be quiet.

1840
02:23:40,820 --> 02:23:41,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1841
02:23:41,140 --> 02:23:42,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was a really good name.

1842
02:23:43,342 --> 02:23:45,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're jacked into the game.

1843
02:23:45,403 --> 02:23:51,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, that is so opening it up to... I'm gonna get jacked on my X-Bone, you guys.

1844
02:23:51,427 --> 02:23:52,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm jacking my X-Bone.

1845
02:23:52,668 --> 02:23:52,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh.

1846
02:23:54,246 --> 02:23:56,708
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1847
02:24:19,369 --> 02:24:26,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say it's not worthy of the list, but I just want to be a little bit less morbid, and I'm sorry, Alan, but I'm going to take off the 8-bit, Godfather.

1848
02:24:27,452 --> 02:24:28,853
[SPEAKER_09]: So nobody else has to.

1849
02:24:29,333 --> 02:24:35,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of thought that was going to go... To be fair, we brought... Even though it's probably going to happen.

1850
02:24:35,935 --> 02:24:37,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought it on ourselves.

1851
02:24:37,916 --> 02:24:40,537
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it was going to be dark, and we made him do it.

1852
02:24:40,997 --> 02:24:42,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly think it's going to happen.

1853
02:24:42,618 --> 02:24:44,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to take it off.

1854
02:24:44,939 --> 02:24:48,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is stricken from the list, so we don't have to talk about it anymore.

1855
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:50,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're up next.

1856
02:24:51,001 --> 02:24:55,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you can see the board there over at live.vognetwork.com, but which of these is not worthy of the list?

1857
02:24:56,204 --> 02:24:58,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Only because it doesn't really make any sense to me.

1858
02:24:58,705 --> 02:25:00,285
[SPEAKER_12]: It just seems very uninteresting.

1859
02:25:00,386 --> 02:25:04,127
[SPEAKER_12]: New Mass Effect Screenshot causes shipping war.

1860
02:25:04,267 --> 02:25:04,848
[SPEAKER_04]: New Mass Effect.

1861
02:25:05,088 --> 02:25:08,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, of course that's going to happen.

1862
02:25:08,770 --> 02:25:09,430
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not wrong.

1863
02:25:10,916 --> 02:25:28,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm not wrong that's a guarantee it's too safe a prediction and we're too edgy here at OLR for that so it is stricken from the list alright, fair enough Jason, it's a tough job but that's what we do here at OLR which of these is not worthy of the list?

1864
02:25:28,682 --> 02:25:31,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Oculus only has one C by the way that's okay

1865
02:25:31,465 --> 02:25:33,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you strike something from the list?

1866
02:25:33,646 --> 02:25:34,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to strike that?

1867
02:25:34,487 --> 02:25:35,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm striking a letter from the list.

1868
02:25:35,848 --> 02:25:36,648
[SPEAKER_04]: You're striking a letter.

1869
02:25:36,688 --> 02:25:36,988
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1870
02:25:37,028 --> 02:25:39,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been stricken from the list.

1871
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:39,610
[SPEAKER_02]: My goodness.

1872
02:25:39,890 --> 02:25:41,391
[SPEAKER_04]: That letter has been stricken from the list.

1873
02:25:41,751 --> 02:25:42,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

1874
02:25:42,211 --> 02:25:43,612
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two very, very good ones.

1875
02:25:43,913 --> 02:25:46,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And which one do I think is less likely of the two?

1876
02:25:47,935 --> 02:25:51,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to toss out 3DS games on the Wii U.

1877
02:25:51,986 --> 02:25:59,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 3DS games on the Wii U. You're going to stick with Alan's more morbid prediction that it's just the regular DS and it disappoints.

1878
02:25:59,695 --> 02:26:08,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think either one of them because the 3DS plays DS titles, but definitely not 3DS games on the Wii U, unfortunately.

1879
02:26:09,406 --> 02:26:09,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love it.

1880
02:26:09,866 --> 02:26:10,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't gonna happen.

1881
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:34,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, again, just like the Mass Effect thing, that's too safe of a prediction.

1882
02:26:34,322 --> 02:26:37,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the Wii U price is going to drop, and I don't think Mario Kart 8 will fail.

1883
02:26:37,644 --> 02:26:40,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll be the second biggest game on the console next to Mario 3D World.

1884
02:26:40,646 --> 02:26:43,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry, Loki, but it is stricken from the list.

1885
02:26:43,607 --> 02:26:49,791
[SPEAKER_04]: But that does mean Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 coming out, that gets immunity, and Alan may not remove it from the list.

1886
02:26:50,191 --> 02:26:53,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1887
02:26:54,694 --> 02:26:59,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a panicked engineer with a crowbar in his hand, Half-Life 3 won't get released, is

1888
02:27:02,151 --> 02:27:04,613
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not allowing that to happen.

1889
02:27:04,673 --> 02:27:04,993
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1890
02:27:05,133 --> 02:27:05,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1891
02:27:06,615 --> 02:27:07,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jason.

1892
02:27:07,515 --> 02:27:09,697
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, too safe, Jason.

1893
02:27:09,717 --> 02:27:11,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

1894
02:27:12,439 --> 02:27:12,799
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1895
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:14,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It is stricken from the list.

1896
02:27:15,061 --> 02:27:15,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is, guys.

1897
02:27:15,922 --> 02:27:17,163
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a very tough process.

1898
02:27:17,203 --> 02:27:18,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like pulling teeth.

1899
02:27:18,364 --> 02:27:19,184
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we go.

1900
02:27:19,665 --> 02:27:21,286
[SPEAKER_04]: The answers you have left to vote for.

1901
02:27:21,686 --> 02:27:24,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

1902
02:27:24,668 --> 02:27:26,430
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW loses a million subs over the year.

1903
02:27:26,510 --> 02:27:28,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.

1904
02:27:28,391 --> 02:27:53,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Indie Game goes from Indie to AAA in the scope of a year Oculus Rift released at 4K resolution Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party Microsoft jacks the Rift Ouya goes under Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints Those are some hefty choices, you guys, but you can vote now Now, some of you might be thinking, oh, all of those are going to come true

1905
02:27:53,351 --> 02:27:56,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're going to click on your number one and your number two.

1906
02:27:56,114 --> 02:28:00,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, the first one you click is your number one, and the second one you click is your number two.

1907
02:28:00,498 --> 02:28:04,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the ones you like the best of those answers that are up on the board.

1908
02:28:04,082 --> 02:28:05,323
[SPEAKER_04]: So have at it.

1909
02:28:05,663 --> 02:28:10,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now live, and you can vote for the next few minutes there at live.vognetwork.com.

1910
02:28:10,768 --> 02:28:12,810
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a live poll, and you may now vote.

1911
02:28:13,190 --> 02:28:17,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will tally up those answers and read the answers here in just a little bit.

1912
02:28:18,355 --> 02:28:18,716
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1913
02:28:19,216 --> 02:28:20,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1914
02:28:20,317 --> 02:28:20,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1915
02:28:21,678 --> 02:28:22,898
[SPEAKER_04]: A little morbid, but that's all right.

1916
02:28:22,918 --> 02:28:26,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we cleaned up the list pretty good there at the end, so it's a little less morbid.

1917
02:28:27,281 --> 02:28:31,924
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a few more stories for you guys, though, before we get to the answers and the FUs of the week and all that good stuff.

1918
02:28:31,984 --> 02:28:33,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

1919
02:28:34,706 --> 02:28:36,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alan, by the way, for participating.

1920
02:28:36,207 --> 02:28:37,248
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let you know if one of yours wins.

1921
02:28:37,268 --> 02:28:38,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1922
02:28:38,669 --> 02:28:46,094
[SPEAKER_12]: So, hey, just in case you wanted to check it out, there's another Telltale series that's free to try.

1923
02:28:46,134 --> 02:28:47,815

1924
02:28:48,288 --> 02:28:49,908
[SPEAKER_12]: for free right now, The Wolf Among Us.

1925
02:28:50,689 --> 02:28:53,750
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can get that free on Xbox Live Arcade.

1926
02:28:54,090 --> 02:28:57,451
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not sure how long that's supposed to be free for, so better act fast.

1927
02:28:57,631 --> 02:29:00,471
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're also doing discounts for some other stuff for the end of the year.

1928
02:29:00,491 --> 02:29:04,293
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been marking down stuff, I think, all the way up through New Year's.

1929
02:29:04,353 --> 02:29:05,873
[SPEAKER_12]: So go check it out.

1930
02:29:08,231 --> 02:29:10,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot of really good things about this game.

1931
02:29:10,352 --> 02:29:11,333
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another one of those.

1932
02:29:11,413 --> 02:29:13,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have played it in 2013, but oops, I didn't.

1933
02:29:14,915 --> 02:29:16,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, I'm very curious.

1934
02:29:16,296 --> 02:29:16,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Check this out.

1935
02:29:16,816 --> 02:29:21,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, before you run away, Alan, don't you read, you read a lot of these graphic novels and stuff.

1936
02:29:21,139 --> 02:29:24,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you familiar with this, this Fables that the Telltale one's based off of?

1937
02:29:25,655 --> 02:29:29,138
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the first three volumes in the office, so yeah.

1938
02:29:29,158 --> 02:29:30,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to check this out?

1939
02:29:30,219 --> 02:29:31,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you curious about this game?

1940
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:38,024
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on what spoilers it has for the comics, because I'm only on volume three of the trade paperback, and they're like on, what, volume 30?

1941
02:29:39,305 --> 02:29:41,787
[SPEAKER_11]: So I checked it out like four years ago and haven't touched it since.

1942
02:29:42,568 --> 02:29:42,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

1943
02:29:43,028 --> 02:29:43,408
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1944
02:29:44,329 --> 02:29:46,731
[SPEAKER_12]: You can still mark it for download, you know, just in case.

1945
02:29:49,534 --> 02:30:01,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, you know, as most Telltale games, if you wait a little longer, it'll probably be like five bucks for the whole thing at some point, but at the same time, I've been hearing great things about it, so I don't know how much longer we can wait, so we'll check that out soon.

1946
02:30:02,485 --> 02:30:03,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Jason, what do you got for us?

1947
02:30:05,331 --> 02:30:07,373
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple months ago, the Mighty No.

1948
02:30:07,653 --> 02:30:12,097
[SPEAKER_02]: 9 gang held a vote to determine the design of Beck's Helper Call.

1949
02:30:12,497 --> 02:30:15,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Those votes have been counted and design number F!

1950
02:30:17,081 --> 02:30:17,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a bow.

1951
02:30:17,781 --> 02:30:23,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a virtual radio bow for everybody but the YouTube listeners because I can drive that point home.

1952
02:30:24,826 --> 02:30:28,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Design F only won by less than 3%.

1953
02:30:28,487 --> 02:30:30,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Design H came in third.

1954
02:30:30,168 --> 02:30:33,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And Design E was the close rejection.

1955
02:30:33,249 --> 02:30:38,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to see what... I should be able to go see the vote and see what Design E is.

1956
02:30:38,210 --> 02:30:42,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really, really dig Design F. Very, very, you know...

1957
02:30:43,812 --> 02:30:52,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden blonde hair, predominantly red, kind of lollipop striping, very appropriate, but really a good design.

1958
02:30:52,659 --> 02:30:57,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, design F, that's E, this will probably take me a minute.

1959
02:30:57,522 --> 02:31:03,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So we finally have the primary two protagonists in Mighty No.

1960
02:31:03,086 --> 02:31:07,870
[SPEAKER_02]: 9, Beck and Call, and what each of them look like, their relevant primary color scheme, and so forth.

1961
02:31:08,939 --> 02:31:13,221
[SPEAKER_04]: She kind of looks like one of those cinnamon candy canes to me with the pink and red striping.

1962
02:31:13,241 --> 02:31:22,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know this is a radio show, so I can't really show you the pictures, but just imagine the whole Mega Man style, which obviously they're changing just ever so slightly for this Mighty No.

1963
02:31:22,405 --> 02:31:25,446
[SPEAKER_04]: 9, but she's more of one of those cinnamon candy canes with big blonde hair.

1964
02:31:25,586 --> 02:31:25,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1965
02:31:25,907 --> 02:31:28,828
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he was pretty good, too, taking a look at that.

1966
02:31:29,128 --> 02:31:30,969
[SPEAKER_12]: They have the designs.

1967
02:31:30,989 --> 02:31:34,450
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go to the second page of the Kickstarter, there's a link on the article there.

1968
02:31:34,930 --> 02:31:36,051
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows the different designs.

1969
02:31:36,807 --> 02:31:41,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like she's going to get something with her ears, like helicopter ears or something, so that'll be cute.

1970
02:31:41,731 --> 02:31:44,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are, oh jeez, what are those called?

1971
02:31:46,295 --> 02:31:52,700
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically like hair, I want to say a hair tie, but that's completely incorrect.

1972
02:31:53,481 --> 02:31:57,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hair tie in a bow, basically, is what's going on there.

1973
02:31:58,165 --> 02:32:15,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And suddenly my chat is not working anymore, so I can't paste this in chat No, they got it, and Pochikawa put it in there too It completely stopped updating for me, so I can't even see it Because tonight is my night of puns, should I read the puntastic quote at the bottom of this article?

1974
02:32:16,637 --> 02:32:23,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure Some of you may have just met Design F, and think it's crazy But she's got the numbers, so she's call now, baby

1975
02:32:27,728 --> 02:32:29,329
[SPEAKER_04]: That is definitely going to do it for the news for 2013.

1976
02:32:29,569 --> 02:32:34,692
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the last news article we are reading this year.

1977
02:32:35,233 --> 02:32:36,253
[SPEAKER_04]: No Mighty No.

1978
02:32:36,273 --> 02:32:38,395
[SPEAKER_04]: 9 in our 2014 predictions, but I am very much looking forward to it.

1979
02:32:38,595 --> 02:32:39,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's because it'll happen.

1980
02:32:39,915 --> 02:32:40,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be amazing.

1981
02:32:40,896 --> 02:32:42,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been a very safe prediction.

1982
02:32:42,637 --> 02:32:45,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they said it's going to come out in 2014 when the Kickstarter whole thing happened.

1983
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:48,361
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, was it supposed to be 2015?

1984
02:32:48,421 --> 02:32:48,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it was 2014.

1985
02:32:49,201 --> 02:32:49,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

1986
02:32:51,835 --> 02:32:52,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1987
02:33:23,240 --> 02:33:25,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, it is about that time.

1988
02:33:25,861 --> 02:33:32,623
[SPEAKER_04]: We're almost to the part of the show where we're going to take calls, but first we want to hear from our listeners in a segment we call the Mailbag.

1989
02:33:33,764 --> 02:33:42,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangelaundry.com and DarkSakura dives into the Mailbag headfirst and finds a few emails that she thinks, oh, this is worth looking at.

1990
02:33:43,607 --> 02:33:44,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about this tonight.

1991
02:33:44,707 --> 02:33:45,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I like D-Best.

1992
02:33:45,908 --> 02:33:46,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're looking at the...

1993
02:33:47,748 --> 02:33:49,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think I really like Dee best.

1994
02:33:50,369 --> 02:33:50,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Why's that?

1995
02:33:50,689 --> 02:33:54,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Dee is like gothic, goth Lolita kind of someone like that.

1996
02:33:54,589 --> 02:33:55,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1997
02:33:55,310 --> 02:33:56,910
[SPEAKER_09]: She's kind of dark and badass.

1998
02:33:57,890 --> 02:34:01,371
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like Bee too because it sort of gives me that Dr. Slump vibe.

1999
02:34:01,511 --> 02:34:02,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag.

2000
02:34:02,191 --> 02:34:06,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I know you're reading a lot of letters, but there's some letters in our mailbag as well.

2001
02:34:06,952 --> 02:34:08,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're complaining about me tonight!

2002
02:34:09,312 --> 02:34:09,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow!

2003
02:34:11,293 --> 02:34:11,673
Wow!

2004
02:34:14,375 --> 02:34:27,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a thought such as it is, I presume the YouTube content ID issue won't come to a head when a major partner channel such as Tabuscus and Epic Mealtime and Vsauce gets taken down for content claims.

2005
02:34:28,327 --> 02:34:36,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Rather, it'll happen when Disney, say, issues a claim or has a claim issued on their behalf against content from one of Viacom's own channels or vice versa.

2006
02:34:38,094 --> 02:34:41,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I'm disappointed that the Mac version of the Stanley Parable requires 10.8.

2007
02:34:41,656 --> 02:34:46,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hesitant to upgrade my OS on my 2009 laptop to even 10.7.

2008
02:34:47,818 --> 02:35:01,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Much less seriously and too wordy from what I understand of the plot of Assassin's Creed 4, I'd like to see them have taken as much historic liberties with their chanteys as with the music of Bioshock Infinity.

2009
02:35:02,683 --> 02:35:14,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Ideally take inspiration from dinosaur comics and sing pop songs with babies substituted with matey Everyone's trying to be me matey, matey I love your way, matey done a bad bad thing and so on That comes from Robert M

2010
02:35:16,673 --> 02:35:37,181
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the YouTube thing I'm full of it tonight Epic Mealtime is never going to have a content ID against them Because all of their stuff is 100% original Here's something else to consider As much as that's how we all want to see it go down You all know YouTube has a secret whitelist That nobody talks about The people that are on the whitelist aren't talking about it But that's why Viacom's not going to have a copyright claim Against them ever

2011
02:35:37,421 --> 02:35:38,181
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on the whitelist.

2012
02:35:38,261 --> 02:35:46,965
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what some of the outrage was, is because some of these people that we would have presumed were on it, affiliates notably, were starting to get screwed by this.

2013
02:35:48,506 --> 02:35:57,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Epic Mealtime, Epic Mealtime primary channel will not, but their spinoff, Original Gamer, assuming that's even still a thing, I actually haven't watched it in quite a couple of weeks now.

2014
02:35:58,069 --> 02:36:03,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Original Gamer stands the biggest threat because of their non-original content, non-original video.

2015
02:36:05,632 --> 02:36:10,756
[SPEAKER_02]: but it remains to be seen what changes do and don't happen as a result of the last couple of weeks of Fallout.

2016
02:36:13,198 --> 02:36:13,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Next email.

2017
02:36:13,878 --> 02:36:14,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2018
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:16,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, OLR.

2019
02:36:16,180 --> 02:36:17,361
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2020
02:36:17,641 --> 02:36:18,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there a name on that last email?

2021
02:36:18,802 --> 02:36:20,884
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Robert M. Oh, I missed that somehow.

2022
02:36:21,744 --> 02:36:23,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to share a quick story.

2023
02:36:23,265 --> 02:36:28,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I just finished rebuilding my DDR pad for this winter and have been jamming about four times a week.

2024
02:36:28,268 --> 02:36:31,869
[SPEAKER_09]: My legs have never hurt so bad and I'm a hardcore road cyclist.

2025
02:36:32,470 --> 02:36:33,490
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a different kind of impact.

2026
02:36:34,191 --> 02:36:39,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, last night I finished on a heavy nine step that is lightning steps for half the song.

2027
02:36:40,214 --> 02:36:43,636
[SPEAKER_09]: My legs were jello so I walked downstairs and completely pulled my left quad.

2028
02:36:44,216 --> 02:36:45,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I can barely walk.

2029
02:36:45,417 --> 02:36:50,740
[SPEAKER_09]: When people ask what happened I get a hazy look in my eye and tell them that I pulled a muscle dance into a video game.

2030
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:52,401
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the typical response?

2031
02:36:52,822 --> 02:36:54,082
[SPEAKER_09]: They smile politely and walk away.

2032
02:36:54,363 --> 02:36:55,924
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know what to say.

2033
02:36:56,024 --> 02:36:56,544
[SPEAKER_04]: How awkward.

2034
02:36:56,984 --> 02:36:58,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to tell you.

2035
02:36:59,617 --> 02:37:05,341
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give you a little bit of advice a trainer gave me, but by no means am I a trainer slash doctor, whatever.

2036
02:37:06,281 --> 02:37:13,025
[SPEAKER_09]: When you are done playing DDR, don't walk downstairs, don't walk upstairs, don't do anything more strenuous.

2037
02:37:13,425 --> 02:37:15,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Walk slowly and stretch.

2038
02:37:16,247 --> 02:37:20,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Stretch while your muscles are warm, and usually you'll avoid cramps.

2039
02:37:20,590 --> 02:37:22,931
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just my experience, but again, I'm not a professional.

2040
02:37:23,731 --> 02:37:25,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a generally accepted thing out there, too.

2041
02:37:25,713 --> 02:37:27,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you always stretch before you play.

2042
02:37:27,774 --> 02:37:28,094
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

2043
02:37:28,114 --> 02:37:28,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't stretch before you play.

2044
02:37:29,155 --> 02:37:29,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

2045
02:37:29,335 --> 02:37:30,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Stretch after you warm up.

2046
02:37:30,956 --> 02:37:31,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2047
02:37:31,316 --> 02:37:34,758
[SPEAKER_09]: If you stretch a muscle when it has not warmed up, you can do more damage to it.

2048
02:37:35,404 --> 02:37:36,105
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

2049
02:37:56,022 --> 02:37:57,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I getting old or am I just overdoing it?

2050
02:37:57,863 --> 02:38:01,985
[SPEAKER_09]: As a 34-year-old, this is my main form of exercise during the non-cycling months.

2051
02:38:02,586 --> 02:38:05,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure you guys have had DDR injuries, right?

2052
02:38:06,328 --> 02:38:09,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, you remember the issue I had with... It's been a long time, but yeah.

2053
02:38:09,369 --> 02:38:11,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I did fall and hit my head on the machine once.

2054
02:38:12,031 --> 02:38:20,075
[SPEAKER_09]: But you remember those shoes that I had that I couldn't do jumping moves because the arch support in my shoes sent pain up my feet.

2055
02:38:21,636 --> 02:38:37,294
[SPEAKER_09]: and so I would come off of the machine with shooting pain going up both of my legs coming directly from my arches because I already have pretty hefty arches in my feet I don't have flat feet I have the opposite problem I have really high arches in my feet

2056
02:38:38,054 --> 02:38:49,542
[SPEAKER_09]: and when I changed from using arch support shoes to using either flats like Converse All Stars or the Airwalk equivalent and my Vibrams, that all went away.

2057
02:38:50,502 --> 02:38:57,046
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was my biggest injury with DDR but I can tell you that I had pulled a...

2058
02:38:58,067 --> 02:38:58,627
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura

2059
02:39:28,326 --> 02:39:29,987
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a few people in chat room, by the way.

2060
02:39:30,047 --> 02:39:34,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft said, I twisted my ankle playing DDR twice, once on a Cobalt Flux pad.

2061
02:39:34,649 --> 02:39:35,489
[SPEAKER_09]: It was rather painful.

2062
02:39:39,730 --> 02:39:41,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So, to continue this email, it's almost done.

2063
02:39:41,711 --> 02:39:44,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, I got Surgeon Simulator on Steam sale today.

2064
02:39:44,252 --> 02:39:46,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Good grief, it's impossible, but hilarious.

2065
02:39:46,933 --> 02:39:48,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.

2066
02:39:49,834 --> 02:39:51,895
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fun game, and yes, it is impossible.

2067
02:39:52,575 --> 02:39:53,856
[SPEAKER_09]: The space one is hilarious.

2068
02:39:55,103 --> 02:39:56,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so last email.

2069
02:39:56,744 --> 02:39:59,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

2070
02:39:59,066 --> 02:40:02,128
[SPEAKER_09]: You get the last email of the year.

2071
02:40:02,168 --> 02:40:03,509
[SPEAKER_09]: You win air.

2072
02:40:03,609 --> 02:40:04,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a deep breath.

2073
02:40:05,290 --> 02:40:09,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to chime in with a few thoughts I had on PAX's diversity lounge idea.

2074
02:40:10,333 --> 02:40:20,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like that by labeling a room as a place to learn about diversity in gaming culture is making it seem like it will be the only room where PAX minorities can feel safe and at ease.

2075
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:25,924
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a hard sell to make a room shoved into a corner feel like you're being, quote, inclusive to people.

2076
02:40:26,684 --> 02:40:35,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wanted to bring your guys' attention to the Awesome Games Done Quick Charity Marathon, which you guys mentioned last year on your show.

2077
02:40:35,610 --> 02:40:40,873
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys talked about it after the marathon was over, so I wanted to make sure all the listeners knew about the marathon before it starts.

2078
02:40:41,314 --> 02:40:50,360
[SPEAKER_09]: It runs from Sunday, January 5th through the 11th and will feature some of the best speed gamers from around the world playing games fast to raise money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

2079
02:40:51,000 --> 02:41:10,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I got really into speedrunning after watching last year's marathon and started learning tricks for some classic games like Super Mario 64 that would be the wall jump and Ocarina of Time learning each new trick helps drive your time down and it's kind of addicting side note my best times on the games are 22 minutes for Super Mario 64 and 25 minutes for Ocarina of Time

2080
02:41:11,491 --> 02:41:15,615
[SPEAKER_09]: There are bidding wars and prize raffles throughout the marathon as well.

2081
02:41:16,016 --> 02:41:27,749
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to donate money to a good cause, have the chance to win prizes, and watch people completely wreck games that you love in ways you never thought possible, make sure to watch and just search Awesome Games Done Quick and it will be the first link.

2082
02:41:28,570 --> 02:41:29,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for reading my email.

2083
02:41:29,651 --> 02:41:32,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope you all had a happy holiday and have a happy new year AZHP.

2084
02:41:33,554 --> 02:41:33,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2085
02:41:34,215 --> 02:41:35,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you for reminding me of the charity event.

2086
02:41:35,876 --> 02:41:37,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Flaco Jones is a big fan of this too.

2087
02:41:37,697 --> 02:41:40,419
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an ex-Furl in a hoard house, watches a lot of this too.

2088
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:45,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, these guys are very popular and it's for good reason.

2089
02:41:45,103 --> 02:41:46,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that speedrun stuff can be addicting.

2090
02:41:47,085 --> 02:41:49,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm terrible at it, but it's sure fun to think about it.

2091
02:41:50,087 --> 02:41:57,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people are just like the level of detail that they understand a game's engine is phenomenal to me.

2092
02:41:58,140 --> 02:42:00,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I used to be able to do that when I was a kid.

2093
02:42:03,702 --> 02:42:13,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I was watching, there's a buddy of mine that grew up in New Mexico that recently moved out to Maine, and I've been watching a lot of the stuff he's been playing.

2094
02:42:14,725 --> 02:42:16,925
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows, like, Spyro...

2095
02:42:19,166 --> 02:42:28,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if it's two or three, but he knows Spyro glitches, like the back of his hand, and he's getting really, really good at getting them reproducible.

2096
02:42:29,556 --> 02:42:33,679
[SPEAKER_02]: He's speedrunning Shattered Memories, even though I don't think there's really...

2097
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:45,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any glitches in it, he just finds the best path and skips through the sequences and cutscenes, the doctor sequences as much as possible, as quick as possible, that kind of stuff.

2098
02:42:45,968 --> 02:42:49,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And that speedrun is literally just learning the best path of the game.

2099
02:42:50,229 --> 02:43:14,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I revisited some of those awesome games on quick videos from the summer and somebody was speedrunning Super Meat Boy just Light World Clear, I don't think he did Dark Worlds but they also got Team Meat in on Skype and the programmers of the game they were shocked that they had never heard of some of these bugs before

2100
02:43:16,321 --> 02:43:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: whether they went and fixed them after the fact or figured out why they're happening I have no idea but just the level of dedication that whether they stumble across it randomly or with skill completely phenomenal and everything about that production is so fantastic great charity, great video, great skill I didn't know they do it twice a year so I'm definitely looking forward to being able to watch that in a week or two

2101
02:43:41,089 --> 02:43:48,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know Dan and I actually tried for like an hour each trying to learn the wall jump in Super Mario 64 so that we could get up to the roof and beat the game?

2102
02:43:48,594 --> 02:43:50,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I had heard of that.

2103
02:43:50,716 --> 02:43:51,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I ever tried.

2104
02:43:51,977 --> 02:43:55,279
[SPEAKER_09]: There's videos up and apparently it's supposed to work in the DS version as well.

2105
02:43:56,380 --> 02:44:00,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the precision to play that on Mario 64 DS.

2106
02:44:03,118 --> 02:44:05,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that is it for the mailbag.

2107
02:44:05,901 --> 02:44:06,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed, that is it.

2108
02:44:06,923 --> 02:44:10,747
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also your very last chance to vote in tonight's list list.

2109
02:44:11,167 --> 02:44:12,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You're already slacking if you waited this long.

2110
02:44:12,889 --> 02:44:13,830
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your last chance.

2111
02:44:14,912 --> 02:44:22,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.VogNetwork.com and we will read the answers here shortly, but first we have the FUs of the week.

2112
02:44:23,441 --> 02:44:23,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2113
02:44:40,595 --> 02:44:46,447
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to Pinkberry for having peppermint and chocolate because it was so good and I want more.

2114
02:44:46,888 --> 02:44:48,911
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've had wine tonight, so no Pinkberry.

2115
02:44:49,952 --> 02:44:50,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Wine's really good.

2116
02:44:50,573 --> 02:44:52,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need any wine flavor for your berry?

2117
02:44:53,015 --> 02:44:53,315
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2118
02:44:53,515 --> 02:44:54,556
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, though?

2119
02:44:54,856 --> 02:44:56,798
[SPEAKER_09]: They had in Japan last year, Rob.

2120
02:44:57,238 --> 02:44:59,820
[SPEAKER_09]: They had muscat grape Kit Kats.

2121
02:45:00,741 --> 02:45:02,983
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were amazing.

2122
02:45:03,003 --> 02:45:03,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet.

2123
02:45:04,024 --> 02:45:07,627
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend who lives in Nagoya sent... You remember my friend Julie, right?

2124
02:45:08,147 --> 02:45:08,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2125
02:45:08,347 --> 02:45:09,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And our friend Krista.

2126
02:45:09,468 --> 02:45:10,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Krista lives in Nagoya.

2127
02:45:10,469 --> 02:45:10,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.

2128
02:45:10,889 --> 02:45:15,193
[SPEAKER_09]: She sent Julie a bunch of muscat Kit Kats, and we went through the whole box.

2129
02:45:16,474 --> 02:45:17,415
[SPEAKER_09]: They're amazing, so...

2130
02:45:19,235 --> 02:45:21,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Pinkberry, get Muscat flavor.

2131
02:45:21,658 --> 02:45:21,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it.

2132
02:45:23,219 --> 02:45:25,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, you have some FUs of the week?

2133
02:45:27,044 --> 02:45:30,167
[SPEAKER_12]: FU to my cat who thinks I'm a pillow or something.

2134
02:45:31,068 --> 02:45:34,111
[SPEAKER_12]: He's literally an inch away from the microphone.

2135
02:45:34,652 --> 02:45:37,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, do you have any FUs?

2136
02:45:41,081 --> 02:45:47,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nothing against alcohol, but F you to excuses to get smashed at 11 in the morning.

2137
02:45:47,828 --> 02:45:48,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's a bit much.

2138
02:45:48,850 --> 02:45:49,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they do to people.

2139
02:45:50,589 --> 02:45:53,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you're not going to dog our wine drinking, are you?

2140
02:45:53,051 --> 02:45:54,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely not.

2141
02:45:54,993 --> 02:45:55,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to be responsible.

2142
02:45:56,094 --> 02:45:57,515
[SPEAKER_04]: We always advocate responsibility as well.

2143
02:45:58,515 --> 02:46:04,480
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to FU to the scare that Alan might be getting sick again and therefore I might be getting sick again.

2144
02:46:04,580 --> 02:46:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just sick.

2145
02:46:05,741 --> 02:46:06,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be sick again.

2146
02:46:06,762 --> 02:46:10,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you should be more concerned for Alan being healthy so Alan can be healthy.

2147
02:46:11,166 --> 02:46:12,347
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I want to be healthy.

2148
02:46:14,381 --> 02:46:14,981
[SPEAKER_09]: So rude.

2149
02:46:15,001 --> 02:46:15,761
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, it would be nice.

2150
02:46:15,821 --> 02:46:17,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, do you hear this fuckery?

2151
02:46:18,162 --> 02:46:20,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it would be nice if Alan was healthy too.

2152
02:46:21,103 --> 02:46:21,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is.

2153
02:46:22,023 --> 02:46:23,724
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it for the FUs of the week.

2154
02:46:23,744 --> 02:46:25,244
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you laughing about over there?

2155
02:46:26,244 --> 02:46:26,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

2156
02:46:26,704 --> 02:46:27,605
[SPEAKER_04]: You trying to start some shit?

2157
02:46:27,625 --> 02:46:28,725
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're trying to do over there.

2158
02:46:28,785 --> 02:46:29,345
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

2159
02:46:29,445 --> 02:46:29,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2160
02:46:30,065 --> 02:46:30,885
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

2161
02:46:31,346 --> 02:46:32,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want Pinkberry right now.

2162
02:46:32,926 --> 02:46:33,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you do.

2163
02:46:33,966 --> 02:46:35,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want to get sick either.

2164
02:46:36,827 --> 02:46:38,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that is it.

2165
02:46:38,669 --> 02:46:44,935
[SPEAKER_04]: We are done-zo with the question tonight from the listless question there.

2166
02:46:44,955 --> 02:46:49,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just waiting for the answers to load in there and we can tell you what the top answers were.

2167
02:46:49,619 --> 02:46:50,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, the definitive list.

2168
02:46:51,801 --> 02:46:54,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Our predictions for 2014.

2169
02:46:54,243 --> 02:46:54,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2170
02:46:54,763 --> 02:46:57,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Your number three answer.

2171
02:46:57,605 --> 02:46:58,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's Alan?

2172
02:46:58,585 --> 02:46:58,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan?

2173
02:46:58,965 --> 02:46:59,366
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.

2174
02:47:00,086 --> 02:47:00,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three answer.

2175
02:47:00,987 --> 02:47:04,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA.

2176
02:47:04,629 --> 02:47:05,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

2177
02:47:05,029 --> 02:47:05,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

2178
02:47:05,749 --> 02:47:06,210
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the winner.

2179
02:47:06,470 --> 02:47:06,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

2180
02:47:07,230 --> 02:47:07,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

2181
02:47:07,851 --> 02:47:08,191
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2182
02:47:08,471 --> 02:47:09,752
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't mean what I said earlier.

2183
02:47:12,013 --> 02:47:13,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, don't cough on my mic.

2184
02:47:13,734 --> 02:47:16,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, the number two answer.

2185
02:47:16,214 --> 02:47:17,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, number two answer.

2186
02:47:18,175 --> 02:47:22,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

2187
02:47:24,877 --> 02:47:31,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And the number one answer, the thing that absolutely has to happen in 2014 as voted on by the listeners.

2188
02:47:32,579 --> 02:47:36,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank God a shiny happy answer won after the dark places we went to tonight.

2189
02:47:37,283 --> 02:47:41,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

2190
02:47:41,245 --> 02:47:41,846
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

2191
02:47:41,866 --> 02:47:42,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

2192
02:47:42,786 --> 02:47:43,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

2193
02:47:43,947 --> 02:47:46,349
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all nice people after all.

2194
02:47:46,389 --> 02:47:46,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes.

2195
02:47:46,829 --> 02:47:47,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Wink, wink.

2196
02:47:47,370 --> 02:47:47,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually.

2197
02:47:48,350 --> 02:47:48,871
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

2198
02:47:49,331 --> 02:47:49,992
[SPEAKER_04]: The definitive list.

2199
02:47:50,032 --> 02:47:57,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that is Fallout 4 confirmed, F-Zero Boner Party, and Innovation leading to advances for the disabled.

2200
02:47:57,097 --> 02:47:57,457
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

2201
02:47:57,497 --> 02:47:59,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for participating in Listless tonight.

2202
02:47:59,939 --> 02:48:00,640
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope to do that again.

2203
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:06,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We have gone too long since the last time we played that game, so we will have to do that again very soon.

2204
02:48:06,684 --> 02:48:07,185
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

2205
02:48:07,385 --> 02:48:10,729
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it for the mailbag, the stories.

2206
02:48:11,270 --> 02:48:20,382
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now ready for your calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2207
02:48:20,502 --> 02:48:22,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It is that time to give us a call.

2208
02:48:22,605 --> 02:48:23,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going to...

2209
02:48:24,247 --> 02:48:25,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to apologize in advance.

2210
02:48:25,587 --> 02:48:28,128
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing something a little different with the Skype line tonight.

2211
02:48:28,548 --> 02:48:31,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm getting to test this live on air as we're going.

2212
02:48:32,549 --> 02:48:33,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So please bear with us.

2213
02:48:34,470 --> 02:48:37,231
[SPEAKER_04]: But with this setup, we do not have to say goodbye to Loki.

2214
02:48:37,271 --> 02:48:39,691
[SPEAKER_04]: He can stay on the line and chat with our Skype calls.

2215
02:48:39,711 --> 02:48:47,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to talk to Loki or anybody here in studio or give your own thoughts on what happened in 2013 or what you'd like to see in 2014, give us a call right now.

2216
02:48:47,953 --> 02:48:52,175
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2217
02:48:52,715 --> 02:48:53,255
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word.

2218
02:48:54,185 --> 02:48:57,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, some last minute stories, possibly, maybe.

2219
02:48:57,326 --> 02:48:59,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, do you have anything for last minute stories tonight?

2220
02:49:00,447 --> 02:49:01,587
[SPEAKER_12]: No, sadly I don't.

2221
02:49:02,328 --> 02:49:05,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's really not a whole heck of a lot going on, is there?

2222
02:49:05,729 --> 02:49:07,309
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me see if we have any Twitter topics.

2223
02:49:07,329 --> 02:49:10,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to pull those up real quick here again while we wait for some calls.

2224
02:49:10,930 --> 02:49:15,612
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2225
02:49:15,872 --> 02:49:17,012
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I hope it works.

2226
02:49:17,032 --> 02:49:22,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know they have a new toll-free prefix coming up?

2227
02:49:22,694 --> 02:49:23,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they really?

2228
02:49:23,194 --> 02:49:23,214
[SPEAKER_02]: 844-

2229
02:49:24,548 --> 02:49:25,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

2230
02:49:25,929 --> 02:49:28,049
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just kind of going down the list of all the 800s, eight double digits.

2231
02:49:28,330 --> 02:49:33,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't be surprised that they're running out of stuff or whatever.

2232
02:49:33,152 --> 02:49:37,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Considering how dirt cheap it is for anybody to pick one up now, and it's only getting easier.

2233
02:49:38,334 --> 02:49:43,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird that for that reason, it's not weird for that reason that non-phone number based systems aren't coming up.

2234
02:49:43,556 --> 02:49:44,396
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell am I saying?

2235
02:49:44,656 --> 02:49:47,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we are getting a call, so let's get to it.

2236
02:49:47,377 --> 02:49:49,978
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to go to the phones right now and take a call.

2237
02:49:50,479 --> 02:49:52,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

2238
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:53,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2239
02:49:55,870 --> 02:49:57,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind, buddy?

2240
02:49:58,753 --> 02:50:02,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first of all, did it work?

2241
02:50:02,697 --> 02:50:03,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it worked.

2242
02:50:03,418 --> 02:50:04,339
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear you just fine.

2243
02:50:05,560 --> 02:50:07,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2244
02:50:07,562 --> 02:50:10,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was thinking about Jason's.

2245
02:50:10,165 --> 02:50:14,009
[SPEAKER_06]: One of Jason's answers, I think it was number one on the list list.

2246
02:50:14,611 --> 02:50:18,034
[SPEAKER_06]: The indie game going AAA development.

2247
02:50:18,935 --> 02:50:26,081
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was thinking about the My Little Pony fighting game that got cease and desist.

2248
02:50:26,401 --> 02:50:27,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you laughing, Jason?

2249
02:50:27,702 --> 02:50:28,883
[SPEAKER_02]: You're laughing like crazy over there.

2250
02:50:29,704 --> 02:50:31,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this doesn't surprise me, I guess.

2251
02:50:33,547 --> 02:50:35,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course you're thinking about the My Little Pony game, right?

2252
02:50:35,489 --> 02:50:35,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It shouldn't.

2253
02:50:38,082 --> 02:50:45,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was thinking about that, and now they're working on their own game, their own original game.

2254
02:50:47,164 --> 02:51:00,566
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was thinking about it and hoping that possibly it could get picked up like a big publisher or something, and get a big release.

2255
02:51:01,706 --> 02:51:05,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like, well, maybe, possibly like Schoolgirls.

2256
02:51:07,905 --> 02:51:10,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a small release, but then it got big.

2257
02:51:10,906 --> 02:51:12,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, maybe not that big, or maybe not AAA, but big, mostly.

2258
02:51:34,133 --> 02:51:35,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fair enough, fair enough.

2259
02:51:36,195 --> 02:51:36,515
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

2260
02:51:36,936 --> 02:51:38,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Any gaming resolutions you have for 2014?

2261
02:51:39,157 --> 02:51:42,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Or no, we read one of your answers during the Google answers, right?

2262
02:51:43,361 --> 02:51:46,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, one of my Google, well, one of, sorry.

2263
02:51:47,765 --> 02:51:48,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Something beeping over there?

2264
02:51:48,506 --> 02:51:50,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the Power Rangers theme?

2265
02:51:50,227 --> 02:51:50,988
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?

2266
02:51:51,028 --> 02:51:51,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2267
02:51:52,349 --> 02:51:53,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was my phone.

2268
02:51:53,950 --> 02:51:54,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2269
02:51:55,171 --> 02:51:59,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, you already read my resolutions, and sorry again, damn it.

2270
02:52:01,434 --> 02:52:02,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop texting Actdeft.

2271
02:52:03,035 --> 02:52:04,577
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on the radio, people.

2272
02:52:06,418 --> 02:52:07,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there we go.

2273
02:52:07,259 --> 02:52:07,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2274
02:52:10,011 --> 02:52:18,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my gaming resolutions are mostly a new PC for gaming because my current one is good, but not that great.

2275
02:52:19,598 --> 02:52:22,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly the processor is old, so I need to at least replace that.

2276
02:52:23,861 --> 02:52:27,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, Matt, it was Power Rangers Ringtone.

2277
02:52:28,144 --> 02:52:28,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was.

2278
02:52:29,404 --> 02:52:29,705
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2279
02:52:29,925 --> 02:52:31,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, go ahead.

2280
02:52:31,886 --> 02:52:35,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my other resolution, the HDTV is, well, my...

2281
02:52:36,607 --> 02:52:47,994
[SPEAKER_06]: My top priority right now because I have the gaming consoles and even the PC which I have the video card has HDMI out so I can use that for gaming too.

2282
02:52:49,855 --> 02:52:55,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Will probably happen soon since I'm pretty much saving the money for that.

2283
02:52:56,656 --> 02:53:17,222
[SPEAKER_06]: so yeah, it's mostly what I want to do next year and of course my hundreds and hundreds of games on Steam and not to mention on Xbox I have the Xbox games that I haven't finished so I need to get on that There's too much to play but it's not exactly a bad problem to have, right?

2284
02:53:18,302 --> 02:53:24,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, too much to play and so little time Alright, well ActDeftBuddy we're going to let you go to try and get some more calls but thanks so much for the call and have a great new year

2285
02:53:25,728 --> 02:53:26,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, you too.

2286
02:53:48,642 --> 02:53:51,124
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, I want to read a tweet.

2287
02:53:51,164 --> 02:53:55,147
[SPEAKER_04]: We had something from YYR and I want to make sure I got this one because this is really funny what happened here.

2288
02:53:55,187 --> 02:54:03,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, YYR sent us a tweet here on Twitter and it says, the number one downloadable 3DS game in Japan this year, Bike Rider DX.

2289
02:54:04,193 --> 02:54:04,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

2290
02:54:05,074 --> 02:54:05,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

2291
02:54:06,175 --> 02:54:08,778
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $2.99 in the North American eShop.

2292
02:54:09,179 --> 02:54:10,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy it, OLR.

2293
02:54:11,121 --> 02:54:12,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and get this.

2294
02:54:12,883 --> 02:54:14,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It was retweeted by who?

2295
02:54:15,585 --> 02:54:16,446
[SPEAKER_04]: The makers of the game.

2296
02:54:16,526 --> 02:54:17,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

2297
02:54:17,427 --> 02:54:18,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Retweeted by the makers of the game.

2298
02:54:18,849 --> 02:54:20,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very cool there, uh...

2299
02:54:20,831 --> 02:54:22,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I guess I'll have to check that out.

2300
02:54:22,913 --> 02:54:24,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about that game.

2301
02:54:24,494 --> 02:54:25,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like a site bike?

2302
02:54:25,515 --> 02:54:28,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's kind of what it looks like to me, just based on what little I see here.

2303
02:54:28,338 --> 02:54:30,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see if there's some of the pictures here.

2304
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:32,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like a lot of this stuff is just retweeted.

2305
02:54:32,582 --> 02:54:34,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, it doesn't actually look like a site bike at all.

2306
02:54:35,124 --> 02:54:37,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this more like a little 2D platformer type of thing.

2307
02:54:37,947 --> 02:54:38,327
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cute.

2308
02:54:38,347 --> 02:54:39,228
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cute, yeah.

2309
02:54:39,248 --> 02:54:39,908
[SPEAKER_04]: For $2.99, I'd try it.

2310
02:54:41,890 --> 02:54:49,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably a style of game not terribly unlike Trials, where more lean mechanics and physics and all that kind of stuff.

2311
02:54:49,318 --> 02:54:50,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it might be a little more something like that.

2312
02:54:51,020 --> 02:54:52,401
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very attractive looking game.

2313
02:54:52,521 --> 02:54:53,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of this before.

2314
02:54:54,483 --> 02:54:55,124
[SPEAKER_02]: 3DS eShop.

2315
02:54:55,845 --> 02:54:58,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what purchase I'm making in the near future.

2316
02:54:58,948 --> 02:55:06,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I think I might actually have enough left in my wallet now that it's shared between Wii U and 3DS because I put like $10 in the other day when I bought Castlevania and stuff.

2317
02:55:06,375 --> 02:55:10,219
[SPEAKER_04]: So I might, which I know I don't have to do that, but whatever.

2318
02:55:11,800 --> 02:55:14,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, 1-877-GAME-O-L-R or use name on Skype, Orange Ones Radio.

2319
02:55:14,663 --> 02:55:17,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Last chance to call the show ever in 2013.

2320
02:55:18,086 --> 02:55:21,469
[SPEAKER_04]: So give us a call and we'll talk.

2321
02:55:21,570 --> 02:55:21,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2322
02:55:21,870 --> 02:55:23,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a lot of, do I have other tweets?

2323
02:55:23,311 --> 02:55:23,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me look.

2324
02:55:24,966 --> 02:55:25,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to other tweets.

2325
02:55:25,746 --> 02:55:28,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet for a future week.

2326
02:55:28,887 --> 02:55:30,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I'm going to be real honest.

2327
02:55:30,108 --> 02:55:32,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to only see the stuff the day of the show.

2328
02:55:33,369 --> 02:55:34,469
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100 Matt sent us a tweet.

2329
02:55:35,649 --> 02:55:42,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine year in MVP baseball lives on through the Latin American mod community with the MVP Carby.

2330
02:55:44,052 --> 02:55:45,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what this is even talking about.

2331
02:55:46,012 --> 02:55:53,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Caribe because it was a... I don't know all of the backstory about this because I haven't followed a lot of baseball video gaming stuff.

2332
02:55:53,815 --> 02:55:53,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

2333
02:55:55,236 --> 02:56:20,974
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically along the lines of a classic MVP baseball game Totally modded for newer rosters I remember this game, that's right, and it's been long gone So it's been gone for 10 years, this MVP baseball Because a licensing deal fell through for them 10 years ago But things live on thanks to this remake, essentially, that's on the PC Which is a celebration of Latin American baseball That's pretty cool

2334
02:56:22,375 --> 02:56:23,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now I get it.

2335
02:56:23,416 --> 02:56:25,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard of this game before, and you can check that out.

2336
02:56:25,997 --> 02:56:31,441
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you like your baseball, Latin American baseball, you can check that out.

2337
02:56:33,021 --> 02:56:39,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, trying to find some other tweets here over at twitter.com slash OLR.

2338
02:56:40,326 --> 02:56:46,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamit Hunts tweeted us earlier this week, or actually it was just yesterday, saying, Oh God, Sky, OLR.

2339
02:56:47,270 --> 02:56:49,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I got started on Tiny Death Star this week.

2340
02:56:50,114 --> 02:56:53,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, yes, I know I'm a bit behind on shows.

2341
02:56:53,679 --> 02:56:55,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody can listen the week of the show.

2342
02:56:56,262 --> 02:57:00,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was just going to say, I finally quit Tiny Death Star just before they put in the holiday stuff.

2343
02:57:00,928 --> 02:57:03,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad I got you hooked on a game that I quit.

2344
02:57:04,273 --> 02:57:05,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Play the Doctor Who game instead.

2345
02:57:06,415 --> 02:57:06,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, Brad.

2346
02:57:07,076 --> 02:57:08,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad was telling me about that game.

2347
02:57:08,637 --> 02:57:09,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty fun.

2348
02:57:09,298 --> 02:57:09,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

2349
02:57:10,119 --> 02:57:11,000
[SPEAKER_07]: How much is it on iOS?

2350
02:57:11,800 --> 02:57:12,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Free.

2351
02:57:12,862 --> 02:57:13,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

2352
02:57:13,823 --> 02:57:14,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

2353
02:57:14,503 --> 02:57:19,949
[SPEAKER_09]: It has the stupid transaction thing again, but you don't need any of them.

2354
02:57:20,049 --> 02:57:21,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't ever used any.

2355
02:57:21,290 --> 02:57:22,492
[SPEAKER_09]: And they give you freebies all the time.

2356
02:57:24,393 --> 02:57:36,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've just I've been replaying levels actually to unlock characters until I got the Sontaran Butler and I always forget that guy's name but like I have River Song now I'm very happy

2357
02:57:39,062 --> 02:57:39,383
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2358
02:57:39,903 --> 02:57:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give one more shout-out for the Skype line and see if we get anybody.

2359
02:57:42,526 --> 02:57:42,966
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.

2360
02:57:43,026 --> 02:57:46,249
[SPEAKER_04]: No, everybody's shy here on the last night of the year.

2361
02:57:46,269 --> 02:57:48,091
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2362
02:57:48,891 --> 02:57:54,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I was worried that the setup didn't work because I have things run differently tonight, but Actdeft got through, so I know it works.

2363
02:57:54,957 --> 02:57:57,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that they're being reflective on the year.

2364
02:57:58,299 --> 02:58:00,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they just being quiet and pensive on the year?

2365
02:58:01,181 --> 02:58:01,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps?

2366
02:58:01,861 --> 02:58:02,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

2367
02:58:02,822 --> 02:58:05,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of Doctor Who games that all have subtitles.

2368
02:58:05,623 --> 02:58:08,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what the subtitle for this particular one is?

2369
02:58:08,264 --> 02:58:11,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Crap, let me look it up because I have my phone in my hand.

2370
02:58:11,706 --> 02:58:14,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me do a couple other quick tweets if I can real quick.

2371
02:58:14,427 --> 02:58:15,167
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a tweet.

2372
02:58:15,288 --> 02:58:17,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this email from last week.

2373
02:58:17,529 --> 02:58:19,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys remember this email last week from C.K.

2374
02:58:19,870 --> 02:58:26,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Ender who was kind of giving us another perspective and I believe it was the email on the NSA and it was kind of making us think differently about that.

2375
02:58:26,733 --> 02:58:30,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, CK Ender sent us a tweet and said, thanks for reading my email and giving it a fair shake.

2376
02:58:30,936 --> 02:58:31,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Great show this week.

2377
02:58:31,737 --> 02:58:32,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what?

2378
02:58:33,158 --> 02:58:35,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Well thought out opinions.

2379
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:39,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always for presenting both sides of the story, so I'm all for that.

2380
02:58:40,044 --> 02:58:50,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we also have another tweet from earlier this week from Dave Falcon, who said, to the OLR gang, Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, hope you and your families have a great Xmas and best wishes for Happy New Year.

2381
02:58:50,752 --> 02:58:51,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much.

2382
02:58:51,473 --> 02:58:51,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Same to you.

2383
02:58:52,133 --> 02:58:52,814
[SPEAKER_09]: That was kind.

2384
02:58:52,974 --> 02:58:53,674
[SPEAKER_04]: That was very nice.

2385
02:58:54,475 --> 02:58:56,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and Tigerclaw sent us one more tweet again.

2386
02:58:56,237 --> 02:58:58,379
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the last call for calls.

2387
02:58:59,140 --> 02:59:01,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe nobody's going to call in last show of the year except Actdeft.

2388
02:59:01,842 --> 02:59:04,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys going to let Actdeft have the final word this year?

2389
02:59:04,825 --> 02:59:05,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, one, eight, one.

2390
02:59:05,666 --> 02:59:08,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Actdeft has earned the final word.

2391
02:59:08,633 --> 02:59:12,915
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2392
02:59:13,936 --> 02:59:18,058
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw305 sending us a tweet here, and this will probably be the last one for the year.

2393
02:59:18,638 --> 02:59:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn discovered on 3DS purchased as Christmas present for 8-year-old.

2394
02:59:23,561 --> 02:59:25,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that.

2395
02:59:25,202 --> 02:59:27,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe this didn't make it in the show roll.

2396
02:59:27,263 --> 02:59:29,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I even came across this this week and meant to put it in.

2397
02:59:29,764 --> 02:59:36,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's why I don't necessarily like talking about this article.

2398
02:59:36,891 --> 02:59:39,774
[SPEAKER_04]: This really at its core has nothing to do with gaming.

2399
02:59:40,575 --> 02:59:44,439
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just shithead moves giving all of us a bad name.

2400
02:59:44,479 --> 02:59:47,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying you can't put porn on your 3DS.

2401
02:59:47,562 --> 02:59:47,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

2402
02:59:48,103 --> 02:59:49,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Put all the porn you want on your 3DS.

2403
02:59:50,405 --> 02:59:53,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Get rid of it if you're going to sell it to a third party.

2404
02:59:53,486 --> 02:59:55,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Because A, you want to get rid of your personal data.

2405
02:59:55,967 --> 02:59:57,947
[SPEAKER_04]: B, what if that's you in that porn?

2406
02:59:58,187 --> 03:00:00,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Most companies have a protocol for removal.

2407
03:00:00,228 --> 03:00:02,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Which this company should have done.

2408
03:00:02,068 --> 03:00:03,909
[SPEAKER_02]: In words and not in execution.

2409
03:00:04,029 --> 03:00:05,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but during the Christmas season.

2410
03:00:06,049 --> 03:00:10,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it is a link to a local news story.

2411
03:00:11,631 --> 03:00:12,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it's local news.

2412
03:00:12,891 --> 03:00:14,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta bring it up here.

2413
03:00:14,152 --> 03:00:15,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta see how the local news... You know what?

2414
03:00:15,972 --> 03:00:18,674
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys aren't gonna call us on Skype, then we're gonna entertain ourselves here.

2415
03:00:19,634 --> 03:00:20,294
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's worse?

2416
03:00:20,535 --> 03:00:20,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

2417
03:00:21,655 --> 03:00:22,275
[SPEAKER_02]: My local news.

2418
03:00:22,295 --> 03:00:23,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually recognize the station.

2419
03:00:24,556 --> 03:00:26,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was... It's Colorado's local... Colorado's news?

2420
03:00:26,937 --> 03:00:27,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver's local NBC.

2421
03:00:27,738 --> 03:00:28,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

2422
03:00:28,638 --> 03:00:28,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

2423
03:00:28,978 --> 03:00:29,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see here.

2424
03:00:29,659 --> 03:00:31,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna try to bring this up here in studio real quick.

2425
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:34,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I did not screen this, so we're gonna take a look at this.

2426
03:00:34,761 --> 03:00:35,461
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it live!

2427
03:00:35,661 --> 03:00:36,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fuck it!

2428
03:00:36,242 --> 03:00:36,902
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do it live!

2429
03:00:38,786 --> 03:00:39,246
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

2430
03:00:39,286 --> 03:00:39,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is it?

2431
03:00:39,906 --> 03:00:40,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the story?

2432
03:00:41,627 --> 03:00:42,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here it is.

2433
03:00:42,507 --> 03:00:43,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Wavy?

2434
03:00:44,788 --> 03:00:47,789
[SPEAKER_04]: DaveyWavyNews10 reports on this story.

2435
03:00:47,929 --> 03:00:48,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

2436
03:00:49,409 --> 03:00:52,570
[SPEAKER_04]: W-A-V-Y, 10 on your side.

2437
03:00:53,450 --> 03:00:54,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what?

2438
03:00:55,431 --> 03:00:55,971
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it says.

2439
03:00:55,991 --> 03:00:57,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, W-A-V-Y is not out of Colorado.

2440
03:00:58,092 --> 03:00:59,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that out of Hampton, Virginia?

2441
03:01:02,185 --> 03:01:02,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know

2442
03:01:20,209 --> 03:01:29,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course there's a... They want... It's a hilarious local ad for a car place that's selling tires with... At least it's not twerking Santa.

2443
03:01:29,518 --> 03:01:31,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Santa shaking his butt there.

2444
03:01:32,501 --> 03:01:33,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

2445
03:01:33,101 --> 03:01:34,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I know which part of Virginia this is.

2446
03:01:34,362 --> 03:01:34,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been here.

2447
03:01:34,943 --> 03:01:35,283
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2448
03:01:36,304 --> 03:01:37,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

2449
03:01:37,604 --> 03:01:42,505
[SPEAKER_00]: A family in Hampton finds sexual images on their son's new gaming console.

2450
03:01:42,665 --> 03:01:43,885
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought it for Christmas.

2451
03:01:43,945 --> 03:01:46,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Their son was the first to discover the disturbing images.

2452
03:01:47,166 --> 03:01:51,547
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 on your side's Jason Marks is investigating... And they bought it for Christmas!

2453
03:01:53,627 --> 03:01:56,568
[SPEAKER_04]: The way she sing-songed that really disturbed me.

2454
03:01:56,848 --> 03:01:57,968
[SPEAKER_00]: ...how this could have happened.

2455
03:01:58,008 --> 03:01:58,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason?

2456
03:01:58,488 --> 03:02:00,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Anita, that's the question everyone is asking.

2457
03:02:01,008 --> 03:02:03,929
[SPEAKER_01]: How could porn get on a newly bought Nintendo DS?

2458
03:02:04,718 --> 03:02:06,879
[SPEAKER_12]: How do people put things on memory cards?

2459
03:02:06,919 --> 03:02:10,080
[SPEAKER_04]: How does porn get on something connected to the internet?

2460
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:11,840
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that happen?

2461
03:02:11,880 --> 03:02:12,741
[SPEAKER_04]: That blows my mind.

2462
03:02:13,021 --> 03:02:16,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, how does porn get on an internet-enabled device?

2463
03:02:17,762 --> 03:02:19,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Because someone owned it before.

2464
03:02:20,543 --> 03:02:20,743
Oh.

2465
03:02:21,323 --> 03:02:24,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why did Channel 10 have to invent... Because they're stupid.

2466
03:02:25,685 --> 03:02:27,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, we haven't seen this the whole way through.

2467
03:02:27,605 --> 03:02:28,806
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're stupid.

2468
03:02:28,886 --> 03:02:29,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at it.

2469
03:02:29,386 --> 03:02:29,666
[SPEAKER_01]: They're stupid.

2470
03:02:29,686 --> 03:02:31,046
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great for us playing this clip on the show.

2471
03:02:31,066 --> 03:02:32,687
[SPEAKER_01]: A gift that was meant for an eight-year-old.

2472
03:02:34,048 --> 03:02:37,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally he would be asking to play on his DS and hasn't yet.

2473
03:02:37,851 --> 03:02:43,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, any kid who just got a Nintendo DS Christmas morning would be chomping at the bit to play the system.

2474
03:02:44,497 --> 03:02:49,381
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tom Mayhew's 8-year-old son got an eyeful just after opening his gift.

2475
03:02:49,681 --> 03:02:53,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Later on during the day he went to play his games, not knowing anything was on it.

2476
03:02:54,545 --> 03:03:02,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after a while, they took a picture of themselves, a couple of the kids that were here, and when the picture was taken, it went to a file.

2477
03:03:03,648 --> 03:03:05,968
[SPEAKER_05]: When that file was opened, there was already pictures on it.

2478
03:03:06,148 --> 03:03:10,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just any pictures, images the Hampton 8-year-old should never see.

2479
03:03:10,689 --> 03:03:19,392
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a shocker because we had quite a bit of the family over, so there was a lot of kids here, and the kids were the ones that discovered those pictures.

2480
03:03:20,342 --> 03:03:21,844
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2481
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:41,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, when you open the 3DS, you don't think, oh, I better go in and check all the pictures, you know, and that whole thing.

2482
03:03:41,642 --> 03:03:43,483
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes sense that, oh, the kids took the picture.

2483
03:03:43,743 --> 03:03:47,445
[SPEAKER_04]: They went to go look at the pictures of themselves in OMG boobs, you know.

2484
03:03:47,525 --> 03:03:49,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, the story does make sense.

2485
03:03:49,725 --> 03:03:51,906
[SPEAKER_12]: And the thing, too, is they bought it new.

2486
03:03:51,926 --> 03:03:53,847
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't like they were buying the used system.

2487
03:03:54,027 --> 03:03:54,988
[SPEAKER_12]: So they claim.

2488
03:03:55,688 --> 03:03:55,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2489
03:03:56,008 --> 03:03:57,749
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the text of the article.

2490
03:03:57,769 --> 03:04:01,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they bought it from Walmart, though, so Walmart doesn't sell used stuff.

2491
03:04:01,930 --> 03:04:03,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Walmart does open box.

2492
03:04:04,634 --> 03:04:06,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Walmart will sell a return.

2493
03:04:06,943 --> 03:04:09,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayu says the DS had a dozen pornographic pictures

2494
03:04:34,466 --> 03:04:36,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he wants to know where they came from.

2495
03:04:37,328 --> 03:04:40,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why don't you ask the lady?

2496
03:04:41,970 --> 03:04:43,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they could have been like internet porno, who knows.

2497
03:04:43,831 --> 03:04:44,271
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big mistake.

2498
03:04:44,291 --> 03:04:46,573
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to note that people will think that.

2499
03:05:01,806 --> 03:05:02,466
[SPEAKER_04]: They're dumb.

2500
03:05:28,383 --> 03:05:29,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2501
03:05:43,951 --> 03:05:45,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very different situation.

2502
03:06:07,518 --> 03:06:09,141
[SPEAKER_02]: These were not pictures.

2503
03:06:09,281 --> 03:06:13,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can save things, save images from the browser to the SD card or what have you.

2504
03:06:14,048 --> 03:06:15,471
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting, it wasn't pictures.

2505
03:06:17,134 --> 03:06:19,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayu tells us the pictures were time stamped in early December.

2506
03:06:19,835 --> 03:06:21,175
[SPEAKER_02]: He bought the system here at the Hampton Walmart the 23rd.

2507
03:06:21,196 --> 03:06:24,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten on your side called the corporate office and were still waiting to get a call back.

2508
03:06:43,244 --> 03:06:48,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so they didn't even get a comment yet.

2509
03:06:48,730 --> 03:06:51,052
[SPEAKER_04]: They just called the corporate office and no letter yet.

2510
03:06:51,372 --> 03:06:53,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's Walmart going to say to that?

2511
03:06:53,975 --> 03:06:54,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.

2512
03:06:55,377 --> 03:06:57,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly an employee was putting boobies on our 3DS.

2513
03:06:57,959 --> 03:06:58,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a gift card.

2514
03:06:58,840 --> 03:06:59,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, here's a gift card.

2515
03:07:01,143 --> 03:07:01,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me let this finish.

2516
03:07:02,304 --> 03:07:04,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Mainly is what is my youngest son doing?

2517
03:07:07,591 --> 03:07:10,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Dad plans to soon have the talk with his son.

2518
03:07:10,796 --> 03:07:14,363
[SPEAKER_01]: A conversation he thought would only come several years from now.

2519
03:07:14,723 --> 03:07:15,645
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an eye opener.

2520
03:07:16,586 --> 03:07:17,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would those even be on there?

2521
03:07:20,037 --> 03:07:23,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayu says he found another clue that could show that there was a return system.

2522
03:07:23,939 --> 03:07:27,901
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nintendo DS comes with parental controls that require a password.

2523
03:07:28,241 --> 03:07:33,564
[SPEAKER_01]: On his DS, the parental controls were already set up, password included.

2524
03:07:34,044 --> 03:07:36,826
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, we're still waiting for Walmart to call us back.

2525
03:07:37,086 --> 03:07:39,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember going through that.

2526
03:07:39,648 --> 03:07:41,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Walmart sold a return system as new.

2527
03:07:41,609 --> 03:07:42,269
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they did.

2528
03:07:42,289 --> 03:07:44,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

2529
03:07:44,291 --> 03:07:44,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2530
03:07:45,011 --> 03:07:49,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Davey Wavy News for the clip there.

2531
03:07:50,495 --> 03:08:02,742
[SPEAKER_09]: To be perfectly honest, I think that especially if that was just a re-boxed return then yeah, he's within his rights to first of all, request a new system and have that sent back.

2532
03:08:03,183 --> 03:08:04,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Because clearly

2533
03:08:05,604 --> 03:08:08,385
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, I'm trying to remember what it is too.

2534
03:08:08,985 --> 03:08:14,387
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't sell a used system without marking that it has been used or a refurb.

2535
03:08:15,207 --> 03:08:23,009
[SPEAKER_09]: That goes against, I'm trying to wrap my brain because I was reading up on the resale law too just not too long ago.

2536
03:08:23,769 --> 03:08:25,450
[SPEAKER_09]: That has to do with truth in advertising.

2537
03:08:26,290 --> 03:08:28,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that at Fry's all the time too.

2538
03:08:28,251 --> 03:08:30,151
[SPEAKER_09]: But Fry's will flat out say return.

2539
03:08:30,371 --> 03:08:32,512
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a big sticker on it that says this is a return.

2540
03:08:32,532 --> 03:08:32,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2541
03:08:33,552 --> 03:08:38,374
[SPEAKER_09]: When you go to any other retailer, it will say refurbished.

2542
03:08:38,674 --> 03:08:44,656
[SPEAKER_04]: In the rush of the holidays, that didn't happen at this Walmart, and now they're going to get right through the coals for it.

2543
03:08:44,696 --> 03:08:45,716
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

2544
03:08:45,956 --> 03:08:48,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can't think of a company that deserves it more, but still.

2545
03:08:48,777 --> 03:08:49,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

2546
03:09:13,463 --> 03:09:28,861
[SPEAKER_04]: and for all we know this should be common sense regardless this prank was probably this whole thing was probably a prank if you think about it the whole thing was probably a setup because there's probably some assholes watching the news giggling yeah oh yeah absolutely the whole thing's probably a setup we showed that little kid some dick

2547
03:09:30,103 --> 03:09:32,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of fucked up in a way.

2548
03:09:32,245 --> 03:09:36,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Or plot twist, it was the news station that returned it with support on it.

2549
03:09:36,668 --> 03:09:37,408
[SPEAKER_04]: For ratings.

2550
03:09:38,149 --> 03:09:39,510
[SPEAKER_04]: For ratings.

2551
03:09:39,550 --> 03:09:40,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to make some waves.

2552
03:09:41,851 --> 03:09:43,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think either of those are the case.

2553
03:09:43,933 --> 03:09:46,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was a new system and I don't think it was intentional.

2554
03:09:47,755 --> 03:09:55,761
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a guy that did something, or perhaps not even a guy, but it was somebody that did something with the system and ultimately didn't want it because they didn't want to

2555
03:09:56,401 --> 03:10:18,737
[SPEAKER_02]: have to continue to pay for new things so they took it back it was just before there's a myriad of other possibilities considering it was just before Christmas I don't I'm with you on the fact that this isn't gaming news and this is just tripe if that's even the correct word to use in this situation this is slow news week news alright fair enough

2556
03:10:19,116 --> 03:10:20,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well that is going to do it.

2557
03:10:20,217 --> 03:10:21,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to close up the Skype line.

2558
03:10:21,479 --> 03:10:22,060
[SPEAKER_04]: How sad.

2559
03:10:22,480 --> 03:10:29,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have thought more of you would want to see our new studio cam on Skype, but I guess I'll have to wait until next week.

2560
03:10:29,849 --> 03:10:31,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft didn't say anything about it either.

2561
03:10:31,331 --> 03:10:32,833
[SPEAKER_02]: He was talking about it in chat.

2562
03:10:32,973 --> 03:10:37,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have thought the first caller would have been like, whoa, I can see you guys now.

2563
03:10:38,740 --> 03:10:42,123
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if we get one more call, I'll even be willing to let it point at me.

2564
03:10:42,203 --> 03:10:42,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I closed it.

2565
03:10:43,344 --> 03:10:43,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Too late.

2566
03:10:43,745 --> 03:10:44,445
[SPEAKER_02]: You lose.

2567
03:10:44,706 --> 03:10:47,869
[SPEAKER_04]: It will have to be a 2014 enhancement to the show.

2568
03:10:47,949 --> 03:10:49,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Actdeft got a sneak peek because he was willing to call.

2569
03:10:50,371 --> 03:10:50,711
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

2570
03:10:50,731 --> 03:10:53,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to close up the Skype line and we're going to close up shop here.

2571
03:10:54,414 --> 03:10:56,695
[SPEAKER_04]: at Orange Lounge Radio for the night and for the year.

2572
03:10:56,955 --> 03:10:59,056
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you guys as always for being here.

2573
03:10:59,357 --> 03:11:00,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening to the show.

2574
03:11:00,677 --> 03:11:03,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for supporting the show all year long.

2575
03:11:03,639 --> 03:11:07,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're new this year or you've been listening for the past eight years, we really appreciate your support.

2576
03:11:08,601 --> 03:11:11,102
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or five about the show.

2577
03:11:11,502 --> 03:11:12,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really appreciate it.

2578
03:11:13,163 --> 03:11:14,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2579
03:11:14,664 --> 03:11:15,884
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we have is word of mouth.

2580
03:11:16,385 --> 03:11:18,005
[SPEAKER_12]: I did have a last minute story real quick.

2581
03:11:18,045 --> 03:11:18,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you do?

2582
03:11:18,486 --> 03:11:20,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, real quick.

2583
03:11:20,587 --> 03:11:21,027
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

2584
03:11:21,067 --> 03:11:21,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

2585
03:11:22,543 --> 03:11:38,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, apparently at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress, which is a hacker con, they demonstrated that they have cracked the Nintendo Wii U gamepad controller to allow streaming of PC content to it.

2586
03:11:39,194 --> 03:11:41,796
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can use it almost like Nvidia's Shield.

2587
03:11:42,036 --> 03:11:42,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.

2588
03:11:43,637 --> 03:11:50,122
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, it's obviously early and a little bit buggy, but they're releasing code out there to

2589
03:11:51,144 --> 03:11:51,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Make that happen.

2590
03:11:51,844 --> 03:11:56,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently they're building tools to allow that to stream stuff on Windows and OSX.

2591
03:11:58,452 --> 03:12:00,414
[SPEAKER_02]: CCC is an amazing collective.

2592
03:12:00,634 --> 03:12:02,636
[SPEAKER_02]: They do some fantastic shit.

2593
03:12:03,177 --> 03:12:03,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them so much.

2594
03:12:04,038 --> 03:12:05,360
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great news.

2595
03:12:06,581 --> 03:12:07,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't they also crack the Wiimote?

2596
03:12:09,865 --> 03:12:10,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

2597
03:12:11,503 --> 03:12:13,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what name went behind that.

2598
03:12:14,225 --> 03:12:25,332
[SPEAKER_02]: If you caught the news about the lifting fingerprints off the phone in order to fake out the iPhone 5S's fingerprint sensor, that was also a CCC project.

2599
03:12:26,233 --> 03:12:31,276
[SPEAKER_02]: They are based out of Germany, and a co-worker of mine has been to a handful of their meetups before.

2600
03:12:32,817 --> 03:12:34,718
[SPEAKER_02]: If I ever find myself in Germany, I would love to go.

2601
03:12:36,903 --> 03:12:37,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

2602
03:12:38,424 --> 03:12:39,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Some thoughts in our chat room.

2603
03:12:39,565 --> 03:12:41,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator saying, here's a thought on the porn story.

2604
03:12:41,986 --> 03:12:50,431
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the odds that a parent, probably the dad, was testing out the system before it was wrapped, forgot that the pics were on the system, and when the pics were discovered, the parents tried covering their asses?

2605
03:12:50,891 --> 03:12:56,394
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, crazier things have happened in the world, but in this case, I don't really think that's happened.

2606
03:12:56,434 --> 03:12:58,616
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what's interesting?

2607
03:12:58,636 --> 03:12:59,916
[SPEAKER_04]: My finger slipped on the trigger.

2608
03:12:59,936 --> 03:13:01,397
[SPEAKER_04]: There's guys sitting at home watching Channel 10.

2609
03:13:01,477 --> 03:13:03,598
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem, too, is the date stamp is different.

2610
03:13:03,618 --> 03:13:05,760
[SPEAKER_12]: The date stamp's earlier than he purchased it.

2611
03:13:05,960 --> 03:13:06,320
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

2612
03:13:07,136 --> 03:13:09,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well anyway, okay, we really are going to wrap up the show.

2613
03:13:09,558 --> 03:13:13,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to talk, for the first time in my life, I don't want to talk about porn anymore.

2614
03:13:13,482 --> 03:13:17,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that is going to do it though for another episode.

2615
03:13:17,206 --> 03:13:18,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Christmas miracle!

2616
03:13:20,009 --> 03:13:20,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Christmas is over.

2617
03:13:20,629 --> 03:13:21,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go, kid!

2618
03:13:21,690 --> 03:13:21,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Dick!

2619
03:13:22,871 --> 03:13:24,193
[SPEAKER_07]: You get dick for Christmas!

2620
03:13:24,793 --> 03:13:39,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it, we're done, we're out of here Thank you guys so much for supporting the show And again, tell a friend about the show We're going to go around and get final thoughts Jason, thank you for being here, taking the trek from the Bay Area to be here I'm hoping we can at least do one show in your neck of the woods at some point It will be wonderful if it comes to fruition

2621
03:13:39,873 --> 03:13:40,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.

2622
03:13:56,149 --> 03:13:56,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2623
03:14:13,071 --> 03:14:15,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We did do a live show there during one of the E3s.

2624
03:14:15,832 --> 03:14:19,213
[SPEAKER_04]: That would probably be the last time we did a full-on show, start to finish, remote.

2625
03:14:19,233 --> 03:14:20,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really cool setup.

2626
03:14:20,214 --> 03:14:21,374
[SPEAKER_04]: That was only a couple years ago.

2627
03:14:21,394 --> 03:14:23,335
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, what, 2006, I think?

2628
03:14:23,355 --> 03:14:24,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, just a couple.

2629
03:14:25,475 --> 03:14:26,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Good memories, though.

2630
03:14:28,736 --> 03:14:29,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's it.

2631
03:14:29,637 --> 03:14:30,637
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go around and get final thoughts.

2632
03:14:30,677 --> 03:14:31,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, now is your turn.

2633
03:14:32,037 --> 03:14:32,638
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought?

2634
03:14:33,638 --> 03:14:34,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Merry fucking 2014, people.

[SPEAKER_04]: Good final thought.

2636
03:14:37,719 --> 03:14:39,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki via the Skype line, your final thought?

2637
03:14:42,099 --> 03:14:46,282
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like Grand Theft Auto V is becoming the hacker fest as Grand Theft Auto IV was.

2638
03:14:46,442 --> 03:14:50,965
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to be interesting how they slap the wrists of all these people doing that.

2639
03:14:51,145 --> 03:14:52,246
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been hearing that, actually.

2640
03:14:52,586 --> 03:14:53,167
[SPEAKER_04]: What a shock.

2641
03:14:53,347 --> 03:14:57,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so shocked that somebody has hacked Grand Theft Auto V. This is so surprising.

2642
03:14:58,350 --> 03:14:59,310
[SPEAKER_04]: They made it so easy.

2643
03:14:59,390 --> 03:15:01,592
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the problem.

2644

2646
03:15:34,278 --> 03:15:38,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually going to retire Reject False Icons because Gorillaz is gone.

2647
03:15:39,341 --> 03:15:40,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they officially?

2648
03:15:40,422 --> 03:15:43,964

[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2652
03:15:47,906 --> 03:15:51,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Think before you speak and think before you type.

2653
03:15:52,028 --> 03:15:52,388
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2654
03:15:52,728 --> 03:15:54,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Think before you speak, think before you type.

2655
03:15:55,570 --> 03:15:57,451
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, don't be an asshole.

2656
03:15:58,378 --> 03:16:00,359
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the number one rule of gaming online.

2657
03:16:00,379 --> 03:16:00,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a dick.

2658
03:16:01,559 --> 03:16:02,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, way too many people do it.

2659
03:16:03,319 --> 03:16:03,959
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.

2660
03:16:03,999 --> 03:16:06,580

[SPEAKER_04]: If you are doing any drinking, do not drive.

2663
03:16:12,382 --> 03:16:13,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not drive.

2664
03:16:13,402 --> 03:16:14,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not drive.

2665
03:16:14,122 --> 03:16:14,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Have your plan to get home.

2666
03:16:14,982 --> 03:16:15,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't get married.

2667
03:16:15,902 --> 03:16:17,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Before New Year's Eve.

2668
03:16:18,303 --> 03:16:19,925
