Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Happy New Year! Well, Happy New Year to those of you listening to this in 2014. Tonight, we're still a few days away, and that means we still have to close out the year. Take a look back with us as we reminisce about 2013, and take your comments and calls on this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to the very last episode of Orange Lounge Radio. For the year 2013!

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Troll-old!

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, why not? Travis was doing that joke last night on Understation Live. I thought I'd continue it tonight. Anyway, hi!

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What do you think of it? We did it last year, too.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We probably do it every year, but anyway, no, we're not going anywhere anytime soon, but the calendar is a-changin'. Welcome, everybody, to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio for this December the 29th of 2013, episode number 533 of our show.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me, as you already heard, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm gonna finish this dang puzzle.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What are you playing right now?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm playing Mii Plaza so I can get puzzle pieces since a certain somebody who also has this puzzle completed came in.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Those puzzles, yes. That is kind of like my little crack addiction on the 3DS, like when I'm not playing a 3DS game or whatever. I like to do the little street passing, collecting the puzzles. You know what's really great for that now is Starbucks.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh yeah, I go to at least three different Starbucks a week now.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And you get like six people at a time now.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Also, I'm gonna steal Alan. Thank you.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Alan, by the way, just since it's not video, Alan brought some wine in for our celebratory last episode of the year. Thank you, Alan. We'll see Alan in Part B a little later.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Jam jar is not bad.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is okay.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not as sweet as Frivolo.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sorry, listeners. I know this is not great radio, but I have wine.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We're having wine tasting.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm having wine, so I'm just gonna sippy here on the wine.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Have wine and coffee.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't know about that combination. All right, but anyway, while we sip away here on some wine, why don't we say hello via Skype? Say hello to Loki, everybody.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hi.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, Loki. How you doing?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was doing pretty good until how many games I bought during the Steam sale. Not so much anymore.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We were talking before the show a little bit, right after, between the Bobby call and then when we went live.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You were asking us, how do you look up how much I've spent on the Steam sale? So you must have found it, and you sound really depressed now.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, I didn't buy all of these, because I got a couple gifted, but I have 30 new games.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh my god, that you just picked up during the sale?

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Wow. And out of those 30, Loki, how many have you actually played?

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A few, actually. I have played a few. But, see, here's the thing. Not all of them were from the Steam sale. Actually, there was one that was part of an indie bundle, and so, I mean, seven of those were...

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I think, actually, the amount of money that I've spent, though, has been quite small, I mean, for 30 games.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So you tend to buy the stuff that's like two bucks?

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That makes sense. I don't blame you. Well, have you played any of the 30 games that you've actually bought?

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, I have.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And what was your favorite out of what you've played so far?

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The Stanley Parable was pretty good.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, it is. Okay, did you get the two special endings? Where you go visit the other places?

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah, I got that ending. I've gotten all the endings, I think.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't spoil y'all, because I stopped to play it.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm about, I think, four away from beating from all of them, but you also get really random ones, too, so...

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, Loki, the sale is through January 3rd. Are you gonna try to restrain yourself now, or is it still open season and you're gonna buy a bunch of stuff?

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, here's the thing. I'm right now thinking of things to actually buy.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I really want. That's the thing.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, yeah, just as said in our chat room just now, because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blocko Show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And 5th Dream in chat says, new sale is up, Loki. Get crackin'. That's right. It's 6 o'clock, so they just flipped over, so...

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And for anyone who's interested, I'm opening Normandy.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And that's your Animal Crossing town, right?

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Has Duke Nukem gone up yet? I've seen it up for a vote, but I haven't seen it actually on sale yet, and I really want it on sale.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Um, I thought it was part of one of the Flash sales, but I don't remember.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It might have been one of the ones I missed. If so, I'm gonna be really irked, because that's one of the games I wanted to get.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But, Loki, thank you again for the $20 gift card you got me for the holidays. I used that to buy a bunch of trading cards and level myself up to 20.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But then I crafted that badge for the snow season, or whatever, the snow winter sale badge.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I got an item in there that I sold for like 75 cents, so that paid for like 5 of the cards right there.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, the items I got were crap, so I ended up just selling all of them, because it was like, ooh, hey, a football manager background. Yeah, totally awesome.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Some addicting crap, though, all that stuff.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, I got some good stuff on Steam, so I'll talk a little more about that later.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ooh, I'm looking, it looks like the Flash sale right now. Stanley Parable, funny enough, you guys talk about that.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And Bioshock Infinite, which I'm gonna talk about a little later, because I finally played it this week.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I need to play that.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Alright, but before we get to that talk, we also have to introduce here with us in studio, say hello to the voice of the show joining us over the season.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I guess this, it's been about three months now, or will be, by the time you're...

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It sure feels like it.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But we love having you here. Even though, you know, we've always kind of been three people, it's fun to mix things up a little while.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And you do great, and you have a great voice. So we always love having here in the studio, Jason, everybody.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's me.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How you doing?

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm, uh, still in a bit of a rush, and I'm trying to get my heart rate back down.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Jason literally walked through the door as we were playing the opening song tonight.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Uh, maybe a little bit before, but what's your excuse, young man? You were in the Bay Area.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What's your excuse, young man? You have a curfew of 6 PM, and you got here at 6, don't you?

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No, I...

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't ever be a co-host on Hoard House, because you will get emails like that.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I, uh, went to a Raiders game, versus Broncos in my defense. I went to a Raiders game with a co-worker of mine, and, uh, despite leaving early traffic and everything else, I just...

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I timed it perfectly well, actually, all things considered.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So you did make it here.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I did make it here.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry you had to suffer through watching the Raiders play. That's, uh, that's unfortunate.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It was, um, it's actually my first ever, uh, game that I've been to in a stadium, football-wise.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've never been to... I've been... I went to the Mile High Stadium as a kid, but for a concert, uh, teenager.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Um, but I don't think I've ever seen a football game, high school, college, like anything, in a venue before.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So, it was nice to see. It was a good reminder to find out how hectic things are, especially in the Bay Area.

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It was fun. It was really interesting. It was really good being able to get out there and do that again.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You didn't get shot, or shot at.

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Uh, one of them, definitely not. The second one, well, there's a lot of bangs in the arena, but I don't think it was somebody firing a gun.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Uh, go to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. BlackWolf says,

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Jason's excuse is identical to mine. That's right.

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Football.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, he plays in the football drumline in Atlanta, so, uh, exciting stuff.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He says he did the show tonight in his uniform. That's how last minute it was.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I was like, why don't you have a webcam, Bobby? That'd be hilarious.

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know, you and I have seen our share of high school football games.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, god, yes, me and the band.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I went to an Alabama Auburn game, which anyone from Alabama, any part of the south will know how big the college football thing is.

103
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I fell asleep. I was so bored.

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Uh, let's see, go into the chatroom as well at live.vognetwork.com.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mako asks some questions about Duke Nukem, saying, wait, Duke Nukem forever? Are you nuts?

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I just want to clarify. Duke Nukem 3D.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If I said forever, then I obviously overly misspoke, and what a faux pas. Duke Nukem 3D is what I'm waiting for.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That was also my very first convention land game.

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Nice.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Was Duke Nukem 3D, when you could do the voice macros and everything. That was awesome.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sure I've told this story on the show before, but we used to play that in the college dorms, like, over the dial-up.

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Because, you know, all those little rooms, I mean, dorm rooms are tiny, right? But we'd all have our own phone number.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, I would play in my room, and then my best friend who lived next door to me would play Duke Nukem in his room.

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And we would call each other over the phone and do that.

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And the bros in the dorm loved it, because they would, like, see where I'm at, and then, like, go run and tell him where I'm at, and then they'd run it over.

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Talk about screen-lookers. Come on, that's just straight-up cheating.

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I know, what a bunch of gossipy bitches. Like, you don't think brosy straight guys can be gossipy bitches?

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Get Duke Nukem. Get Call of Duty in the mix, and we all understand that.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No offense, but offense.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I played... man, what were my early dial-up days? I remember a lot of Warcraft II.

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I know I played Shadow Warrior once or twice with a friend of mine. I feel like we had to have played Duke Nukem.

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There... some game of its ilk at the time. There was definitely another first-person shooter I played a couple times.

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
For the life of me, I can't remember what it was.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Tigerclaw in the chat room reminding us, I got Duke Nukem 3D when Good Old Games gave it away.

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
God bless Good Old Games for giving that away. I actually got that too, so I'm very thankful about that.

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The reason why I also want it on Steam, but I want to get it on sale when it's only, like, three bucks,

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
is because they have that multiplayer coming, which, you know, the Good Old Games one is great,

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
but it doesn't, like, they're trying to add to it for the Steam one, so that's what I'm trying to get in on.

129
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So, actually, clue me in on this, um, have we... has Duke Nukem multiplayer on PC not been a thing at all yet?

130
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Like, in, of course, the modern remakes, DOSBox emulation, that kind of stuff.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, you should still be able to land it.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Because, like, Loki, do you know?

133
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's just not easy.

134
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, this is not easy. It's not what he used to be.

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I think, I mean, I don't know, I haven't messed with it.

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This dream says Duke Nukem gossipy bitches edition.

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was going to say that I played a Duke match not long ago, but now that I think about it,

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
that was probably on Xbox 360 after I picked that up.

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh, yeah, that was on.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And, yeah, I guess, I guess games of those time were built for, like, IPX and NetBIOS

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and all of this other ridiculous out-of-date nonsense that predates, you know,

142
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
LAN parties in the stable way that they are now.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Well, as exciting as it is to talk about a 20-year-old game here on the program...

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And 28-8 bod motives.

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hey, we love our retro games. That's, you know, part of what we're all about.

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But I want to kick off tonight with the topic that I'm sure a lot of your favorite podcasts

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and websites and so forth are getting into on this slow news week

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
because it is a bit of a slow news week, you know.

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We had a pretty major holiday happen this past week

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and, you know, things that people are celebrating, a lot of people traveling.

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So there was not a lot of gaming news this week.

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We'll get to what there is in a moment,

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
but this is the time of year where a lot of people talk about what was your top games of the year.

154
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So I want to start that same conversation here at Orange Launch Radio,

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the top video games of 2013.

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But a very important difference, what we're trying to do here.

157
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Here at Orange Launch Radio, we want to talk about our, or as the case may be,

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
your favorite games of 2013, meaning there are no right or wrong answers.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We're not trying to say, this is the list and shut the hell up.

160
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We'll do that later in list list because that is where we do the scientific list and the way things are.

161
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But for this, this is just about, hey, these were my favorite

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and so there's no right or wrong answers.

163
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So I just want to know, like, what were your favorite games of the year?

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Chatters, if you want to play along, shout them out in the chat room.

165
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Your one, two, and three, what were your top three games of 2013?

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And to be honest, guys, they didn't have to be released in 2013.

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They could be any time if it was something you really got into this year

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that made 2013 for you.

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So how about ladies first, just because I'm dying to know for DarkSakura,

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
her top three games of the year.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
DarkSakura, what was your number three pick and why?

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
My number three?

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't even know if it actually came out this year, but I'm going to say fractal anyway.

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Fractal anyway?

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Fractal, make blooms not war, because that has been my crack.

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If ever, and I'll tell you, and I mentioned this before,

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
if ever I need something to distract myself that will make my mind work,

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
especially work on a pattern, it's fractal.

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And I love the game. I am super hooked on it.

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And I, yeah, fractal. Fractal, make blooms not war.

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That is actually a game I got into a little bit when you sent that to me.

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I did play a pretty good amount of time one night.

183
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It was a really kind of different puzzle.

184
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It reminds me of the old school games of life that were on the Commodore 64,

185
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and I'm not talking about the board game version with the wheel in the car with the pegs.

186
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm talking about, like, this dot will survive if surrounded by other dots,

187
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
but not too many, then it will die.

188
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And you just see these really very pretty patterns that bloom from that.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It was almost like that idea, like as a puzzler, was really cool.

190
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Well, especially with the ambient music that plays in the background,

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
it's, I'm trying to think of the right way to phrase it.

192
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, that's it.

193
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This game is actually from 2010, believe it or not,

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
but it was offered as parts of bundles in 2012 and 2013,

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
so it kind of came to more prevalence later.

196
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, then I'll tell you what, I have a different game that came out this year.

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And that's Legend of Zelda Link Between Worlds.

198
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Ah, okay.

199
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Because it's fun, and I still haven't gotten past the second boss in the dungeon

200
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
because that one is always the one that got me in Link to the Past.

201
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But it's really fun, I love it, and the 3D makes me completely motion sick.

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So that will be my number three.

203
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But the 3D is really good, I gotta say.

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It is, but it still makes me motion sick.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So I don't use it that often.

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's actually very disorienting, especially when you're,

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I love the switch in perspective when you jump from a higher plane to a lower plane.

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Because the camera actually moves with you just a little bit.

209
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But otherwise, you know, I've been completely enjoying it.

210
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That game is definitely on my list.

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Alright. Excellent.

212
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Because I want to stick with stuff that came out this year.

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Okay, fair enough.

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Loki, what's your number three pick?

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
My number three pick is going to be probably, it's kind of a toss-up.

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It almost sounds like a three-way tie for number three.

217
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
We'll have a time to talk about honorable mentions later.

218
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay, so let's see.

219
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll probably do, since I was gonna go by how long I played games,

220
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
but let's do Saints Row IV, actually.

221
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Just because it was, you know, I like Saints Row, but it was a little bit of a disappointment

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
just because it seemed like it was kind of rushed.

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But I still enjoyed it.

224
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's just, you know, it's frustrating that it, I know it, having played all of the entire series,

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I know how good it could be.

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And it's disappointing to see that it didn't quite make it there,

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
mainly to where Saints Row II and III would have been.

228
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It had potential, so hopefully the next Saints Row that comes out will be much better,

229
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
but yeah, it's still pretty good.

230
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Alright. And you did talk an awful lot about that game, all the good and the bad,

231
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
so it doesn't surprise me at all that that is in your top three.

232
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Jason, I don't know if you were wanting to do this tonight.

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I know you tend to play a lot more of the phone games and the classics,

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but do you have three games from this year?

235
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Based off going, like, the only way I can really gauge it is going based off the kind of things

236
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
that I've been talking about a lot, and I think I've come up with a one, two, and three.

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay.

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So, number three, I'm going to give to FTL, Faster Than the Light,

239
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
because I've not had, like, despite how much I complain about that game,

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be playing it.

241
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And it's, you know, it's not particularly puzzly, it's kind of Twitch action

242
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
because it's overriding theme more than anything else is management of individuals,

243
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
because the pathfinding, yeah, whatever, the attacking isn't exactly,

244
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
you can drill down and make things a little bit more difficult

245
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and a little bit more complicated and directed,

246
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
but it's just a good, I don't even want to call it a god sim,

247
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
it's really hard to pin down, but it's just a satisfying,

248
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
nearly mindless, but not if you don't want it to be kind of adventure game.

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You know, I need to check this game out.

250
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is one of those games I've always been meaning to check out,

251
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
especially because it's sort of like a roguelike,

252
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
but just to be clear, this game was released in September of 2012,

253
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
but it doesn't, well, it really doesn't matter, because again,

254
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
like, how many games, and you know, it's so funny,

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
who was it on Twitter posted their top ten?

256
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It was, who does Twisted Metal? David Jaff? Is that his name?

257
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, he does Twisted Metal. Loki.

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah, that's him. I don't know how to pronounce his last name.

259
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He posted, like, his top ten of the year, and Sonic Racing,

260
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the one that came out last year, technically, the one with Danica Packard,

261
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Sonic All-Stars Adventure Racing, whatever was in his list,

262
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and everybody was like, you idiot, that came out in 2012, boo!

263
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But it's like, okay, but there's so many games,

264
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
like, how big is your backlog, people?

265
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Like, there's still games, like Stanley Parable, I just said,

266
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I need to get around to playing that still.

267
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I need less than 25% of my Steam library, so...

268
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Exactly. Mass Effect, I did not discover my love for until, like,

269
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
four years after the fact, so you know, these things happen,

270
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
so I just want to make very clear, we're not trying to come up with, like,

271
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
some journalistic, this is the best of the best, it's no, you're free.

272
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
These are our gaming years, and FTL definitely ranked up there quite quick.

273
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I haven't played in a couple weeks, I need to change that.

274
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
When we get that tweet that's like, why did Jason put a 2012 game on his list?

275
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm gonna go ballistic, I'm gonna say, weren't you listening?

276
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Listen to all the other words, come on!

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But you do remind me, I need to check that one out,

278
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
as old as the game may be getting at this point.

279
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's still quite fun, very fun.

280
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
All right, very fun. I guess just me's left, right?

281
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay, my number three pick, my number three pick is Super Mario 3D World

282
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
on the Wii U, which is, god, the Mario games are damn near always,

283
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
like, rock solid games. I mean, there's a reason why people eat up

284
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
anything with Mario in the title, because, especially when it's, like,

285
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
the main series games, the platformer games, they are almost always,

286
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
without fail, some of the best games to come out for the year.

287
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
A few exceptions here and there.

288
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But Mario 3D World is by no means an exception,

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
it is one of the best of the year.

290
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I did not know how a 3D game was gonna go over on the Wii U,

291
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
because, you know, it's not in 3D, but they made it work out very well.

292
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I love the return of the classic styles of Princess Peach and Luigi

293
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and so forth from Super Mario 2.

294
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I think the level design is fantastic, and especially later on,

295
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
it just gets brutal in some of the more secretive stages

296
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
that come up much later on.

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The game can just be damn near brutal,

298
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and it's an amazing amount of fun with friends as well.

299
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's a game that Wii U badly needed, that's gonna move some consoles,

300
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and rightfully so. It is a must-have game on the Wii U,

301
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and absolutely one of the best of the year.

302
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So Mario 3D World, my number 3 pick.

303
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Alright, let's get into, let's read some number 3s from our chat room.

304
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Degenerate Johnny says, Dead Space 3, Code Man, Borderlands 2,

305
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Tech 2030, Tomb Raider, let's see,

306
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Dark Tetsuya, Unreal Tournament Game of the Year.

307
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Found it at Goodwill over the summer and been playing the hell out of it.

308
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That works, that works.

309
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Alright, there you go. Let's get into some number 2 picks.

310
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Dark Sakura, your number 2 pick.

311
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The Stanley Parable.

312
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The Stanley Parable.

313
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Because that game sort of snuck up on me,

314
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and I'll tell you how I heard about it.

315
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It was actually through a parody.

316
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Not really a parody, but it was a response to an email

317
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
that the game creator had about it.

318
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And so he had the narrator narrate the response and the letter

319
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
about this guy being a major douchebag who emailed about it.

320
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I was like, why do you say Stanley so many times?

321
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Like, well the game is about Stanley and you'll blah, blah, blah.

322
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So anyway.

323
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So once I saw that I was like, okay, I have to play this game.

324
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So I downloaded it.

325
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I paid full price for it on Steam at the time.

326
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It was worth it.

327
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I've totally enjoyed it and I try to sparse out my playing through it

328
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
because honestly I still get really motion sick with first person games.

329
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But I really just enjoyed the really bizarre sense of humor

330
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
that went into making it and I love the narrator.

331
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I just sort of, you know, tried to do stuff now to spite the narrator.

332
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And it's so fun.

333
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So the Stanley parable gets my number two.

334
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
When you have like a little sarcastic antagonist slash protagonist

335
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
slash do I root for this bad guy or not type character

336
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
like you had in Portal for sure.

337
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I notice you tend to love those types as a lot of people do.

338
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So that doesn't surprise me at all.

339
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I like games that are mockeries of other things.

340
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I love, I'm a big fan of satire.

341
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And it seems to me that a great deal, I mean, well, hello, I like Homestuck.

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But I mean I like anything that is both a satire and homage to a genre.

343
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So I've been having a good time with the Stanley parable.

344
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And I think that it's something that if you haven't played yet

345
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
you definitely need to play it.

346
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Act Definitely in our chat room saying playing the Stanley parable

347
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
makes me kind of anxious.

348
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But it's so good.

349
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It really is good.

350
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's such a great game.

351
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And that and I just want to send a message to

352
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
we should get the narrator from the Stanley parable to do a bumper for us.

353
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If they would, I would love that.

354
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That would be amazing for the VoG network.

355
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
OrangeZoundsRadio asked me to do a bumper and I said, well, sure.

356
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Excellent, excellent.

357
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Who's up next? How about Loki?

358
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Loki, what's your number two pick?

359
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
My number two is going to be Bioshock Infinite.

360
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It was a great game and had a lot of moments in it

361
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
where it was just very awe-inspiring, I guess.

362
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And the ending was, it was very satisfying, I guess.

363
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So definitely Bioshock Infinite for number two.

364
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I like games that have moments.

365
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The very beginning, I mean, you don't even have to wait that long.

366
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Just, you know, within like the first two minutes it's just like,

367
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
whoa, that's pretty powerful.

368
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Well, I didn't want to get into my gaming week too much.

369
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I was going to say this for a little later,

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
but I will say I did finally jump in and play Bioshock Infinite

371
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
for the first time this week.

372
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I was lucky enough to get it as a gift on Steam and I was like,

373
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
all right, it's about frickin' time I finally played this game.

374
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And I was blown away by the graphics.

375
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
They are so good and the atmosphere of the Columbia is fantastic.

376
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Like, you know, I played the first Bioshock and I was like,

377
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
oh, this is all right and I see why people are into it.

378
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You know, the more the story unfolded and so forth.

379
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But this one just, not to be crass, but it had me by the balls

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
from the very beginning.

381
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It was so good and the way the environment is

382
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and all the things to look at and the story behind it.

383
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Like, Dioshock, I think if you could handle the first person shooter,

384
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I mean, it's unfortunate, you know, you have the sickness,

385
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
but I think you'd be really into this too because there's so much of the lore.

386
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I do have the sickness.

387
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The lore and the culture with it.

388
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
No, I know I want to play it.

389
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I have it. I've had it for a while.

390
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So I definitely want to. It's just...

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And there's some very uncomfortable things.

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I know some of you guys have probably heard about the controversies

393
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
in the game and so forth.

394
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
There's some very uncomfortable things in there about America's history.

395
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm from Alabama. I can deal with it.

396
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I know, but it's done in a very tasteful way for a story

397
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
that pushes it forward without it being, like, shocking,

398
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
if that makes sense.

399
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It is shocking.

400
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It seemed really realistic to me.

401
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I mean, if you've ever looked at any photos from America's history,

402
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
or even not just America, but, you know, other places in the world,

403
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
it's something that it's very period-specific.

404
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So, unfortunately, it didn't make my top three,

405
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
probably because I got into it too late in the year,

406
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
but it would definitely be one of my honorable mentions

407
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
of a late ad to my list.

408
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But anyway, Loki, not to derail what you were saying,

409
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
but it's just I had to get that out there that I played it this week,

410
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and I was just so in love with it.

411
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's great.

412
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay. All right.

413
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Do you have anything to add, Loki?

414
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Nope.

415
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
All right, then Jason, we'll go to you.

416
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Jason, what is your number two pick?

417
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Continuing my trend of playing catch-up,

418
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
it was recently revealed to me that Borderlands 2 was 2012.

419
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Fabulous powers weren't revealed to you the day you held off your sword?

420
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I just don't remember that day.

421
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't remember being at the store.

422
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't remember where in the year it actually fell.

423
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
All the DLC was this year.

424
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah, and that's actually what I'm basing this off of,

425
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
is that I made a point a couple of episodes ago

426
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
back when the PS4 was coming out,

427
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
or just after the Xbox One was out, one of the two close enough together.

428
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
At any rate, one of the things that's been really interesting to me

429
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
is that because online is ubiquitous everywhere,

430
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
we are truly starting to see video game communities in the video game

431
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and not fan forums and that kind of stuff

432
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
that has a very serious disconnect from the game.

433
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I keep wanting to say Bioshock, because we were going on and on about that,

434
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and I want to play that too,

435
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
because Borderlands is multiplayer and has a lot of work put into it

436
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
to make sure that the experience of playing together is good,

437
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
not to mention the randomness of the loot and the DLC

438
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and the keys that SHiFT gives out

439
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and everything else that's going into that game.

440
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
There are a lot of video game communities,

441
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
but Borderlands 2 is the first one that I know of that's console-specific

442
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
that's putting in a lot of work into maintaining original content

443
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and the health of that community at large.

444
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Funny enough, you are not the only one to put in that game from last year.

445
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
At your number two, I see Seattle in chat says his number two pick

446
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
is Borderlands 2 as well.

447
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Long distance high five.

448
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
There you go. Awesome.

449
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
My number two pick is a game you've heard me talk a lot about on this program,

450
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
but with good reason,

451
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
because it is absolutely one of the best of the year,

452
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
if not the past few years.

453
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
The Lich King.

454
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
No, close.

455
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn is my number two pick for game of the year.

456
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 was one of the most awful MMOs ever made.

457
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That is no secret.

458
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The fact that they were able to bring in a new producer

459
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
who has worked utter magic with this,

460
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
because not only was he able to take,

461
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
not only did he make a great new MMO that was very competitive,

462
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
that had a lot of the great stuff that we love about World of Warcraft

463
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and Guild Wars 2 and other MMOs that are out there on the market,

464
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
but kind of put the Final Fantasy brand on that

465
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and even push it forward a little bit.

466
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The fact that he was able to do all this and back the car into the spot,

467
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
so to speak, of,

468
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
oh, but we've got to make sure 1.0 continues into this

469
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and the things that everybody started at 1.0 have to carry over.

470
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That was a miracle in gaming that they did with that game.

471
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It is gorgeous to look at, it's fun to play,

472
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and it is probably going to be one of the best MMOs of this decade,

473
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
because if you think about it,

474
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
World of Warcraft still have a great love for that community.

475
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'll love that game.

476
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I cancelled my account this week, I'm sorry to say,

477
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
because I've been paying for two MMOs.

478
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn is where it's at for me right now,

479
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and WoW is an eight-year-old game.

480
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
End of an era.

481
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Running on that engine.

482
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It is in a way, it is in a way.

483
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I don't even think the new expansion is going to be enough to make me want to go back.

484
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's one of those, I'll check it out, but we'll see.

485
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm so excited about a lot of the stuff that's going on in Realm Reborn right now,

486
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
especially with the latest patch and so forth.

487
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I think it is kind of the end of an era just as, and to be fair,

488
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
before the angry Blizzard mob comes at me with their pitchforks and torches,

489
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
just as when I left Final Fantasy XI to go to World of Warcraft,

490
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
that was the end of an era.

491
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
This is what's next.

492
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The pendulum has swung, and now we're on the other side.

493
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Did I mention the soundtrack is so flipping good?

494
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Unless you get tired of listening to the Chocobo music the whole time.

495
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I might have actually been playing Final Fantasy XIV right before this very show tonight,

496
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and I was running a Titan kill, which those of you that have played the game know,

497
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
you have to kill the, I'm not even talking about the level 35 one,

498
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm talking about the one at level 50.

499
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh my god, oh my god, look at the YouTube of the fight.

500
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's crazy.

501
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And the music is like this rock song that's like,

502
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That's like death metal that plays in the background,

503
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and it's like, your heart is beating so fast.

504
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I know Alan could probably hear me from the other room,

505
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
like every time I got hit with something I shouldn't have,

506
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
it's like, fuck, motherfucker, piece of shit, god damn it.

507
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I have Tourette's or something sitting there playing this game,

508
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
but I'm just like that into it.

509
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I was playing with a fun group of people.

510
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Funny enough, Darlena, who's one of the hosts over on All Games of,

511
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm going to mess up the name of the show, I'm so embarrassed,

512
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Cat and Fox, I think she's one of the hosts of that show,

513
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I was playing with in a group and we were having a lot of fun,

514
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and I helped one of their friends get a Titan weapon, or relic plus one,

515
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
so that was good.

516
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I was having some fun with Final Fantasy XI,

517
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I was changing up the music because you could kind of mod it a little bit

518
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
and add your own tracks and where different songs were.

519
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So I had Otherworld from Final Fantasy X as my fight theme the entire time,

520
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
or Smack My Bitch Up from Prodigy, depending on if it was a party or not.

521
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And then what was it, for the Chocobo theme,

522
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
it was Falcor's music from Never Ending Story.

523
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So that made the game even better.

524
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

525
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You kept wondering what would be the WoW killer for many years,

526
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
so do you feel that Final Fantasy XIV killed it or did WoW kill itself?

527
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't think WoW is dead by a long shot.

528
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Are they hemorrhaging subscribers in a way? Yes.

529
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But are they still the biggest MMO four times over? Absolutely.

530
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And there's still a great community over there.

531
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I may be finally tired of the game, so in that regard,

532
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
yes, WoW is killing itself because it's not innovating fast enough.

533
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That's the problem, is that now everybody's sitting here going,

534
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
We are done with Pandaria, we are ready for that next expansion.

535
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Oh, you just announced it. Oh, it's going to come out in maybe six months.

536
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
This is Blizzard's biggest problem right now,

537
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and I don't know if it's because they're spreading themselves out

538
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
amongst five games or whatever, but they're moving too slow.

539
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And I know Blizzard has a reputation of it will get out there when it's done,

540
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and when we rush things, something like what happened with Diablo III will happen,

541
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and I understand that, but you look at something like Hearthstone as well,

542
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Hearthstone is a great game. It is moving too slow.

543
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Why is that game still in beta? Why?

544
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
They're still balancing things, really? It is moving too slow.

545
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It is time to open up that beta and just launch the damn game.

546
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
If you have to still balance some cards, is it really that big of an issue

547
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
because most MMOs out there still need fixing?

548
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I think the game's in fine enough shape.

549
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And it's not even just MMOs.

550
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Blizzard's entire catalog is balanced once every month, basically.

551
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And this may just be the difference that ten years makes or whatever,

552
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
where that whole mantra for Blizzard where it's like,

553
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh, we'll just take time until it's right.

554
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm not saying don't take the time to get it right,

555
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
but I'm saying move a little faster, you guys. I'm sorry.

556
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's the reality. They're not moving fast enough.

557
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't think anything's changed in that regard.

558
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I think they still can take their time,

559
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:13,000
because they have three solid IPs that are by no means close to danger.

560
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Fair point, because does it work for Diablo? Yes.

561
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
StarCraft? Yes. Hearthstone? Yes.

562
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
A game where you're asking...

563
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I actually wasn't counting Hearthstone.

564
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You said it yourself. WoW is still strong.

565
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But between WoW, Diablo, and StarCraft, they are very healthy right now.

566
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's strong, but it is losing steam.

567
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And the difference there is you are asking people to pay a monthly fee for World of Warcraft.

568
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And it's like...

569
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And not only that, but then you nickel and dime them with the server changes,

570
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
which... I get it. Final Fantasy XIV does it too.

571
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
They make their money or whatever.

572
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But I just think it's moving too slow.

573
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Like, you want me to pay for eight months while I wait for an expansion?

574
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Like, no, I'll quit, and then maybe if the expansion is good, I'll come back at that point.

575
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That's the reality.

576
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
By which you mean you will come back for at least a month to find out.

577
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
For like a month, yeah, of course. Why not?

578
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
More than that, we'll see.

579
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
We'll see.

580
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Alright, anyhow, moving on. Let's get to number one.

581
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Number one!

582
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
That's right, Numero Uno.

583
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Dark Sakura, your number one pick for Game of the Year.

584
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Animal Crossing.

585
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Why am I not surprised?

586
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I've played this game, like, addictive.

587
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's so crazy.

588
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I have friends that play with me.

589
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Hayak Deft.

590
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You may have just had your town open during this very show.

591
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I did, and then it crashed on me, and Mr. Resetti showed up making a face at me, so whatever.

592
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But I love Animal Crossing.

593
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I think that they have found what works again, and it's become fun.

594
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You know, even Dan has a character. He still lives in a tent, but he has a character in my village.

595
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And I was thinking about it, too, that, you know, I've been using it to help Julian with his reading,

596
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and to bribe him into paying attention to other people, but it's got appeal for all ages.

597
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I really have been enjoying my game.

598
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I also may have finished my wine before you did. Like, all of it.

599
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It was really good.

600
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Rob, wine!

601
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
No, I don't need any more, especially since I have to drive tonight.

602
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah, there's one glass limit for her. I'm just slowly sipping away at this.

603
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
We'll finish that bottle, don't worry.

604
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Because Alan's here tonight. I don't have to pick him up.

605
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Do you like the jam jar?

606
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah, this is good. I like this.

607
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Because of my seal of approval.

608
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
All right, number one from Loki, as if I have to ask.

609
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
If it is not the game I'm thinking it is, I may have a heart attack and die, so let's see what happens.

610
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Loki, your number one pick of the year.

611
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I want you to die, so yes, it is going to be Grand Theft Auto V.

612
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Of course! Of course!

613
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I mean, what else would it be?

614
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's a great game and I love it.

615
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And they're still making it better.

616
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That's it. Grand Theft Auto V. Not a surprise.

617
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And if you want to know more about why Loki picked Grand Theft Auto V as his game of the year,

618
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
just go back to the previous 15 episodes of the show or so since the game came out.

619
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Basically? I was going to say exactly the same thing.

620
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Jason, numero uno, number one.

621
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
If for no other reason than because of the last two weeks, definitely, certainly, completely, Rogue Legacy.

622
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I've been having, especially with the controller now, it was always a fun game on the keyboard.

623
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And I just kind of live for that adventure, random, twitch, roguelike, platformer,

624
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
just all things together, the music and everything else.

625
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I've been having so much fun with that game.

626
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Throw in a controller, I've been using the PS4 controller religiously like every day since I've started,

627
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
since I got it and actually got it to work.

628
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's been insane amounts of fun.

629
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And I'm thinking that when it's out on, I'm thinking when it's out on two systems that I don't have

630
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and one system back home that I'll get back to eventually, those being the PS Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4,

631
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I may buy it again because just to have the console experience from the ground up,

632
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
not to mention there's some very, very frustrating Mac bugs with Rogue Legacy.

633
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But besides the point, more specifically, I've had a conversation with a friend or two in the last couple of days.

634
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I kind of want to get a Vita for a number of reasons and that's basically PlayStation 1 classics

635
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and some of the newer games, being able to play them portably just seems like a worthy investment.

636
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And that's always what it is for me with consoles, rather with portables,

637
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
is that when I can play something anywhere, I love to be able to do so.

638
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And Rogue Legacy may tip me into that purchase and so for that very reason, that's my number one pick,

639
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
hands down, of this year.

640
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And it actually came out this year.

641
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It sure did.

642
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah.

643
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It sure did. No, it's a great pick. It really is.

644
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I was listening to the show on the way up here, of course,

645
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and I was listening to you and Bobby talking about it in the handoff.

646
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And like anything else, it kind of has that first little hurdle.

647
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Grinding pays off and this game doesn't stretch it out unreasonably.

648
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But it's actually coming around a second time because I'm at a point where I like to clear the entirety of the areas.

649
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I posted a screenshot to Steam two nights ago or something like that,

650
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,000
that I finally, for the first time, accessed and cleared every single room in the castle and the forest.

651
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It is still the only time I've done that once and then I frickin' die in the tower of the third area

652
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
because things get really hard really quick.

653
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But things are moving along.

654
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I have retrieved every item from the Enchantress and I need to start buying them.

655
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm in a good place right now.

656
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You're way further than I am, that's for sure.

657
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And it's just managing the upgrades and figuring out how I want to proceed from there.

658
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And finally taking on the third boss and holding my own for more than 30 seconds.

659
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But yeah, very fun game and so much fun.

660
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Awesome. My number one game of the year will probably not come as a huge surprise.

661
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And I mentioned on November 23rd, which was the day that the Xbox One came out,

662
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I said, isn't it funny that Nintendo today released two games that are damn near contenders for the game of the year.

663
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And sure enough, both those games released ended up in my top three.

664
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You had Super Mario 3D World at number three and The Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds at number one.

665
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Because that game is my fucking game of the year.

666
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And I think some of this is a little bit personal as well.

667
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I know that some big outlets put it in their number one to such controversy.

668
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But, you know, good for them because it's my number one too.

669
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And I'm going to tell you, the way that they took one of my top five retro favorites of all time period

670
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and brought it into not like a remake or even a reimagining, but just another story,

671
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
a chapter two in that game that you love.

672
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But now it's got all that new technology of the current console.

673
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Like the way that it moved seamlessly from Super Nintendo to 3DS is just, it's so right.

674
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And it feels so great to play.

675
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And I love some of the changes they made to it.

676
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I know some of the things were controversial where you rent the weapons now and you can do the dungeons in any order.

677
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But I think that's cool.

678
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And I think it makes for, you know, a different, a more Mega Man-esque Legend of Zelda, if you will.

679
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You know, it's something a little bit different, but it is such a fun adventure to play.

680
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And I loved every second of it that I've played it.

681
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And it is a Link to the Past wink for me that I loved.

682
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And I just, yeah, a fantastic game in my game of the year.

683
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
For the record, you could actually do two of the levels in Link to the Past out of order.

684
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yes, but, you know, weren't they numbered?

685
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
They were.

686
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The little crystals were numbered.

687
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
They were, but I always did five and six backwards.

688
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I would do the water palace first.

689
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Alright, so there it is. Those are our three games of the year.

690
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But what about you guys? Take a look at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

691
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Locopoco says, number one, BlazBlue, Chronofantasma.

692
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm a fanboy who can't put the arcade stick down.

693
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Scottatron says, The Last of Us, hands down my game of the year, the game speaks for itself.

694
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Tech2030 says, Tales of Celia, for sure.

695
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I clocked in like 50 hours in that game and I'm about to go back in for a second time.

696
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Let's see, some other number ones here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

697
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I think I got mixed in with the number twos here.

698
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
There were a bunch of people that did theirs in bulk at the start of all the games.

699
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah, that's where I got to.

700
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Grand Theft Auto V, Degenerate Johnny says, Dark Souls.

701
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Codeman says, Super Mario 3D World.

702
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, Super Mario 3D World.

703
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So there's a sampling of some of the answers there in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

704
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Open forum for a minute. Honorable mentions.

705
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Some games that didn't make your top three, but they deserve a shout out here as well.

706
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Jamie?

707
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm going to say the stupid Pokemon.

708
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Just because it was the first ones that I actually wanted in a while.

709
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And I'm having fun with it so far. It's cute. It's Pokemon.

710
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I like roller skates.

711
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I don't like that every time you accidentally bump into a chair, you sit on it.

712
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
But other than that, I'm not too frustrated with.

713
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And I also don't like the 50,007 Pikachus.

714
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
57,000 Pikachus.

715
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But I wanted a Pikachu. That's the one that people want.

716
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So why not give it to them?

717
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And then you see nothing but Pikachu for another year or so.

718
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
True. And that's all that's in the world trade.

719
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Loki, you mentioned you were trying to decide between a few games there.

720
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
What are your honorable mentions?

721
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Let's see. Far Cry 3, Blood Dragon.

722
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I just bought that.

723
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It looks pretty odd. Yeah.

724
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I bought that too and then I was like, ah, I have to do Uplay.

725
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Ah, I forgot about that.

726
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And then, let's see. The Stanley Parable would probably be another one.

727
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Um, I don't know. That's pretty much it.

728
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Jason?

729
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Because I couldn't find a place for it in the top three and just because it...

730
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Despite how deep it goes, I'm kind of surprised that I bumped it into my top three.

731
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But considering everything I've talked about, obviously Papers, Please is the honorable mention that I would have loved to put in my top three.

732
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
That's on my list and I hear so much good things about that game.

733
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's...

734
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I was gifted a copy of that too by a kind person.

735
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
My Steam backlog is so big, I'm gonna cry.

736
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Tears of joy, tears of joy.

737
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's a good problem to have.

738
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I have half my library. I can't even play because I don't have Mac ports.

739
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I have another game. Little Inferno.

740
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You were talking a lot about that game when it first came out. I remember that.

741
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I mean, it's worth a playthrough at least once.

742
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The combos are hilarious.

743
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But once you get past that, it's sort of weird.

744
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
But it was really fun. I liked it.

745
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Oh, and Limbo.

746
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Limbo was fun.

747
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I just want to note for some honorable mentions I have as well.

748
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I don't know if you have some extras, Jason.

749
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But some honorable mentions I have as well.

750
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I think the first half of this year was...

751
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Usually the first half of the year is not as strong as it was this year.

752
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
But we had some great games just in the first three months of this year.

753
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
But don't forget games like Ni No Kuni was a great RPG.

754
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
As much as we have fun with Bobby Black Wolf, kind of teasing back and forth with that.

755
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Ni No Kuni was a great RPG. Beautiful style. Beautiful soundtrack to that.

756
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Great game. I love Ni No Kuni.

757
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Bioshock Infinite would definitely be an honorable mention for me as well.

758
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
We just talked about that a minute ago.

759
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Tomb Raider, which hasn't come up yet, but that game was phenomenal.

760
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And is making a lot of people's year-end list.

761
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And with good reason.

762
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It was so great to finally...

763
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You play a game like Tomb Raider and you're like,

764
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yes! This is the Tomb Raider I wanted to play.

765
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Tomb Raider is definitely the most...

766
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And it looks gorgeous.

767
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm kind of excited about the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One version.

768
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I mean, yes, it's a little weird to have a remake of a game that was just out.

769
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
But at the same time, with even more power, I'm really excited to see what they're going to pull off.

770
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I loved Tomb Raider.

771
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I do need to add another one on my list too.

772
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Skullgirls.

773
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Oh, of course.

774
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
For fighting games. That one was really fun.

775
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Jason, any others? I didn't mean to cut you off a minute ago.

776
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Hotline Miami.

777
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Oh, good one.

778
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Which I haven't put enough time into.

779
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I just bought that for Dan because it was a dollar.

780
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
More things to throw out in the chat room here.

781
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Let's see, some honorable mentions.

782
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Dungeon Buster says, Metal Gear Solid Revengeance.

783
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Tomb Raider.

784
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Tech 2030 says, Ni No Kuni, Tomb Raider, Crysis 3, BioShock Infinite.

785
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
We're all first three months.

786
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That was crazy.

787
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Siaos is Pokemon XY.

788
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Steamworld Dig.

789
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Team Fortress 2.

790
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
There's still a lot of people.

791
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Hey, there are still a lot of people playing that.

792
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Awesome Unicorn.

793
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Guacamelee.

794
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Guacamelee is great fun.

795
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
In Dark Soccer, you mentioned you just bought that.

796
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I did have money, but it was cheap.

797
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm waiting for it to be, for when I get my PlayStation 4.

798
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I believe that it might be Guacamelee.

799
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
What did I say? Guacamole?

800
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Guacamelee.

801
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Guacamelee.

802
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Guacamelee.

803
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Degenerate Johnny says, Shadowrun Returns and Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition.

804
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
There you go.

805
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
SSJ 100 Matt, Don't Starve, Poker Night 2, Pokemon XY, and DuckTales Remastered.

806
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Oh yeah.

807
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
DuckTales was, as much as the cut scene thing bothered me, it was still, the game was a lot of fun.

808
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And the new level was frustratingly hard.

809
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I have another game.

810
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That is definitely an honorable mention.

811
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
The whole rest of that game wasn't?

812
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Not really.

813
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Vesuvius was crazy though.

814
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
This is because of my heart.

815
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Namco High.

816
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
No, seriously.

817
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It's like such a, you know me in parodies and satires and tributes and things.

818
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I fucking love that game.

819
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It makes me laugh every time I play it.

820
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Just knowing the characters from the obscure Namco titles.

821
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And the homestuck characters in it and playing as the cousin of the prince of all cosmos.

822
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It's just so crazy that it's stupidly fun.

823
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Not quite enough to make it into my top three but definitely has a warm fuzzy place in my heart.

824
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Alrighty.

825
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Alright well good discussion.

826
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Lots of great games.

827
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
This is a very good year for games.

828
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And on top of that you get two new consoles and I'm sure they're gonna really start to roll out some of the heavy hitters next year and the year after.

829
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
We already know that because of the delays unfortunately.

830
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Next year is going to be a great resurgence.

831
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I can't even say a resurgence for console gaming but that's the way that it feels.

832
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It's like everything has kind of been, you know, the late day, the late age games have been coming in at the mid and end of the year.

833
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Literally the end of the console life.

834
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Right.

835
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But next year is just gonna, there's gonna be a lot of heavy hitters really quick next year.

836
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Oh yeah.

837
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It's gonna be all of our poor wallets collectively.

838
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yes.

839
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well you know you have things and on Playstation 4 you have, what was that?

840
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The Order, the one about the wolves and all that that looked really cool that they were shown at E3.

841
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And then you have Infamous Second Son is next year as well and you know there's a lot of great stuff on Playstation.

842
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Drive Club.

843
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Drive Club finally coming next year.

844
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Xbox One has the Quantum Break which will, the new Halo you know is gonna be the holiday thing next year.

845
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Lots of great things on there as well and then you know I'm sure the current gen consoles aren't stopping either.

846
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
There's gonna be another Mass Effect.

847
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And then of course Nintendo on Planet Nintendo where they do things Nintendo's way.

848
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
They will have Mario Kart 8 is gonna be huge.

849
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
A lot of people theorizing they'll at least tease the next Zelda if it's not out next holiday.

850
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Smash Brothers will probably be a big holiday one for sure.

851
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Absolutely.

852
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And who knows what else from Planet Nintendo.

853
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I expect that game to be more like mid year.

854
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
There's no way they're gonna make it, they're gonna take it to holiday season next year.

855
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
They got Mario Kart now.

856
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
But maybe we should say predictions for later.

857
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah perhaps. Well we do have 2014 predictions coming later.

858
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
In an old segment we call Listless coming a little later on the show tonight.

859
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
We haven't done that in a while.

860
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
So stay tuned for part B.

861
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But for now we're gonna get into the news after we do our gaming weeks.

862
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So stepping away from the games of the year a little bit just quickly.

863
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
What have you been playing this week? What have you been getting into?

864
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

865
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I played some stuff.

866
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Animal Crossing and I played some Final Fantasy 14.

867
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And I got some of my old school friends into Final Fantasy 14.

868
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
People from my Digimon days.

869
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And the stuff and words and other games.

870
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I bought a bunch of games that I haven't started.

871
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I played some Fractal.

872
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I played some Mass Effect 3.

873
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I played some Mass Effect 2.

874
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Because basically I have a new computer.

875
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Oh yeah. That was your holiday gift huh?

876
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Not really the computer. The guts in it are new.

877
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The case. The motherboard. The processor.

878
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
The only things that we carried over from my old computer were my graphics card.

879
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
My power supply and my hard drive.

880
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Because I already have a 3TB external storage as well.

881
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So my new computer is pretty hardcore for me.

882
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It does what I want it to.

883
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So I made sure to upgrade the games that I really wanted to play.

884
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I've played some Skullgirls.

885
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I reinstalled Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age and I'm working on modding them right now.

886
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And Skyrim was in the middle of installing when I left the house.

887
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Have fun with that.

888
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
With my new processor and everything, the installs don't take long at all.

889
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Because first of all we have our own router.

890
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So we get better speeds with our router and everything.

891
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And then my computer is so fast now.

892
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I love it.

893
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And then Dan just took all the old guts and threw together a new computer.

894
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Because we had the extras.

895
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
He's like, let's give this one to my mom.

896
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So that's what he said.

897
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So I've just been playing random things really.

898
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And more Namco high.

899
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Because that game is crack.

900
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I think that's it.

901
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

902
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Well, I bought a lot of things.

903
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I played a few things this week.

904
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Actually, surprisingly enough, not Grand Theft Auto 5.

905
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And that's kind of surprising because they had their holiday thing where they had it snowing and everything.

906
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And just didn't get a chance to play it.

907
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It's buried under cores right now.

908
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I did play Duke Nukem Forever.

909
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And it was terrible, unfortunately.

910
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It kept crashing every single level.

911
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It would crash.

912
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Every single level.

913
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So after about seven levels I said, fuck it.

914
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And I uninstalled the game. I'm done with it.

915
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It's not good in any way.

916
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It's just...

917
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's absolutely terrible.

918
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It's not what a Duke Nukem game should be.

919
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
There's no point to it.

920
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It seems like they're more fascinated with, hey, what kind of interactive things can we make?

921
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Alright, cool. Look, we made all these light switches and shit you can do that you don't really need to even mess with.

922
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And then the game's just very basic looking.

923
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
It just looks old.

924
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I don't know how to really describe it beyond that.

925
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Other things I played.

926
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I played a little bit of a brand new game I bought.

927
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.

928
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Now, it's an indie game.

929
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And it's kind of cool.

930
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's a cross between almost like a 32nd hero and a shooter and the Oregon Trail.

931
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So you're in a wagon like the Oregon Trail.

932
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And it's like, day one, you've encountered some wildlife.

933
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You go hunting.

934
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And so your actual wagon is just shooting out bullets.

935
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And you have to kill these things and avoid hitting the animals and stuff.

936
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And you collect meat that way.

937
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It just keeps popping up different random little mini games almost.

938
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And it's just ridiculous.

939
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It's a lot of fun and pretty cheap.

940
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So I played that.

941
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I played through the Stanley Parable.

942
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And quite a bit through that.

943
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I think I pretty much finished the game and I've gotten most of the achievements so far.

944
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Aside from some of the ridiculous ones like where you have to mod your date on your computer and stuff.

945
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And then, let's see, I played a little bit of Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

946
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
A little bit more of that. That was kind of fun.

947
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I tried Proteus, which is kind of a very retro looking 3D first person, I don't know, art game, I guess.

948
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
There's not really a point to it.

949
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
But I was just showing it to Josh because I wanted to show him a game that wasn't scary, I guess.

950
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So he dug that a bit.

951
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It was neat. I don't know. It's very short.

952
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And I think actually that's it.

953
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Alright, sounds like you definitely were dipping into some of that stuff you bought on Steam.

954
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So you weren't wasting money.

955
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah, I was going to say real quick I was just going to run down what I picked up from Steam.

956
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Uh oh. Well it is a 3 hour show.

957
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It'll be quick. It's only 30 games.

958
00:53:47,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Sequence, Dust and Elysian Tail, Bionic Commando, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, Don't Starve, Terraria, Left 4 Dead 2 because that was free,

959
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Operation Flashpoint Red River, Fuel, Overlord 2, Overlord, Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising,

960
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Clive Barker's Jericho, Damnation, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, Super Hexagon, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Rise of the Triad, the new one,

961
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Cube, Gateways, Drastic Man Epic, Half-Life Soars, Lamalana, Blockland, Ballpoint Universe, Infinite, Retrograde,

962
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:38,000
In order to love 2D Evolution, Final Fantasy VII, The Stanley Preparable, The Orange Box, and finally, actually from last week, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.

963
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Geez.

964
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
That's a good haul.

965
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And it was only 60 bucks. So averaging about 2 bucks a game.

966
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You know what? Considering that's the price of one new Xbox One or Playstation 4 game, that's doing really well for yourself.

967
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Hours and hours of entertainment, so why not? And supporting a lot of indie games in there too.

968
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Alright, my gaming week will be quick because I pretty much already talked about the big new one, which is Bioshock Infinite.

969
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
If I may, I also did buy Dust.

970
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Oh, did you?

971
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Yes, I did.

972
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I did also play, besides just Bioshock Infinite, I did some virtual consoling on the Wii U.

973
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Because nobody told me that Legend of the Mystical Ninja had come out on the Wii U.

974
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That is like, even, okay.

975
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
There's some of those games, like, I loved it when it was out on the Super Nintendo, like, originally.

976
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And I loved the fact that, you know, you had the little towns and you had the, like, minigames you could play in the towns.

977
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
By the way, one of which, Gradius, you can play Gradius in Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

978
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It's a scaled-down version of it, but it's there.

979
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So, you know, I loved that game as a kid.

980
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Playing it now in retrospect, I'm kind of like, this game was kind of derpy.

981
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But I adore it for its derpiness and for some of the things it tried to do.

982
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And, you know, I made a great Miiverse post that is right now the most popular post in the Legend of the Mystical Ninja community.

983
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Which is, it was a screenshot of me playing Gradius, and I put,

984
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Look guys, I'm playing a virtual console game inside my virtual console game.

985
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
It's Virtual Consolception Horn.

986
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It's got, like, 25 likes, so, my Miiverse moment of fame.

987
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's got 25, yeah!

988
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yes! Or whatever it's called, so that's fun.

989
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
But yeah.

990
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
How about 55, huh?

991
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Well, this is funny, because for the first time ever, I finally got the joke in the game where there's a quiz show game that you can play

992
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
where it asks you questions about the game in the first couple stages to see if you were paying attention.

993
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And one of the questions is, like, how many legs does the boss have?

994
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And the answers are none, two, and 573.

995
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And for the longest time, you know, you think,

996
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Oh, 573, that's silly, because that's a big number. Nothing has 573 legs.

997
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
But now looking back, you're like,

998
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Oh! Get it?

999
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And, yeah. Which, if you didn't know,

1000
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Thank you, Konami.

1001
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
573, in Japanese.

1002
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
If you abbreviate some things and kind of say a lot.

1003
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You have to kind of take some liberties, but it is konami, basically.

1004
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It'd be go, nana, mi, mitsu.

1005
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
So, there you go.

1006
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
But yeah, you have to take some liberties, but that's why Konami's kind of always married with the number 573.

1007
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
So, there you go.

1008
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Let's see, I think that was about,

1009
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Oh, then I also played Castlevania.

1010
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Because that came out on Virtual Console a few weeks ago, and I just never picked it up until now.

1011
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And, yeah, between that, Bioshock Infinite, Final Fantasy XIV, that was a week.

1012
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So, there you go.

1013
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Last but not least, Jason, your gaming week.

1014
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Mine was pretty simple too, but I'm not nearly as expansive and elaborate as Rob's.

1015
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
So, it will take probably a quarter of the time, if not less than that.

1016
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I also really like to talk, and I've been drinking, which makes me more rambly.

1017
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
You chatty bitch.

1018
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Yep.

1019
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I sent out a couple more gifs right around Christmas for various members.

1020
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Ms. DDR Angel, friend of the show from many, many years ago.

1021
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Haven't heard much out of her, but I saw something on her wishlist.

1022
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Oh, I still talk to her. She's still around.

1023
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh, yeah.

1024
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
She's on Steam, and I just added her on 3DS a couple days ago.

1025
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I don't know if she's an active listener anymore, because I think she's just kind of...

1026
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Just not in the chat.

1027
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But she does have a very neat blog called The Eco Maker.

1028
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Yes.

1029
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Do you check it out, people, because if you're into doing DIY things on the cheap?

1030
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Uh-huh.

1031
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Well, they were...

1032
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And I don't think she would mind me repeating.

1033
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
They were having some hard times a few months ago, and so they were really thinking like,

1034
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
you know, how can we do something shortcutting?

1035
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So, a lot of great ideas in this blog on how to do it on the cheap.

1036
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So, yeah. It's a good blog.

1037
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Anyway.

1038
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Amusingly enough, I don't even remember what I sent her, but there was something at a good deal,

1039
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and I saw that it was on her wishlist, so I jumped on it and sent it her way.

1040
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Speaking of which, she should open your present.

1041
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I should open my present.

1042
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
A live unboxing. A live unpresenting.

1043
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Apparently, I'm finding out that apparently roguelikes are my favorite game,

1044
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
because Loki also sent me Super Wagon Adventure, which I need to actually play at some point,

1045
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
and I picked up Electronic Super Joy.

1046
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Neither of those are being roguelikes, but I cracked open Doom RL, which is the Doom roguelike.

1047
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Just kind of randomly crossed my mind this week, and I wanted to see how it's improved,

1048
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and it actually has graphics now.

1049
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Wait, Doom RL?

1050
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Doom RL.

1051
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I've never heard of this.

1052
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Doom roguelike.

1053
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It's surprisingly fun.

1054
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm a little sad that the levels are...

1055
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
They're very roguelike instead of being very Doom-like,

1056
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and I mean that in like Classic Rogue and...

1057
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Oh, Jesus.

1058
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
NetHack.

1059
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
All that kind of stuff.

1060
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Very classic, very boxy, and...

1061
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yeah, it scales down the Doom textures and plays it again, but...

1062
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I don't know.

1063
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Maybe I'll look in and see if I can make levels myself,

1064
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
because it'd be pretty cool to actually put homaged, if not straight up ported, Doom worlds into Doom RL.

1065
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But obviously, considering that I just gave it number one, a lot more Rogue Legacy as well.

1066
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I think I got another 30 levels or some odd like that.

1067
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Levels basically map to how many upgrades you got,

1068
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
so a good heaping helping of ours in the last week.

1069
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
After I watched you streaming Super Hexagon, I tried that out for myself again,

1070
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
and it's strange.

1071
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I bought it on iOS some time ago, and I'm not terrible at it on iOS,

1072
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
but on a D-pad, I'm just abysmal.

1073
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
My records are barely 20, 30 seconds on any level and much less on the higher ones.

1074
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
No, those are really good scores.

1075
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
They really are.

1076
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
But I can beat 30 seconds relatively easy on iOS,

1077
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and I think it's because, for what it's worth, the D-pads on Apple laptops are very small,

1078
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
and so to play them with these micro-touches doesn't work very well where on iOS

1079
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I just have to jam my finger onto one of the sides of the iPhone or iPad or what have you.

1080
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But yeah, fun reminder.

1081
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Like I said, I played that game on iOS some time ago, and it was really fun.

1082
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Super Hexagon, Rogue Legacy, Doom RL, probably something else that I don't even recall at the moment.

1083
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I feel like I talked about it last week.

1084
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Definitely the continuing rogue-like week.

1085
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
That is a great week to have, as far as I'm concerned.

1086
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It absolutely is.

1087
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I love me some roguelikes.

1088
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Real quick, I forgot. I went to Golf Land this week.

1089
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Oh no.

1090
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's sad.

1091
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I looked at DDR and was like, what have they done to you?

1092
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah, it was bad. I didn't actually get to play any DDR, unfortunately.

1093
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I got to try out that Super Mario Kart arcade GP or whatever it is.

1094
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Worst idea ever is to have active commentary from some guy talking about the race.

1095
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I was like, why did they even add that? It was completely annoying the entire time.

1096
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And yeah, Golf Land is sad.

1097
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I think a lot of the arcades we used to love, it's so hard to go into them and see a sea of little kid gambling games.

1098
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
The ticket-spitting games. It's just so hard to see that.

1099
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Don't get Josh addicted to those.

1100
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Nah.

1101
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Alright.

1102
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Moving on, I think we are going to get into some news, but first some quick housekeeping.

1103
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R or you can also follow us on Facebook.

1104
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

1105
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
We're also on Google Plus.

1106
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

1107
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,000
We do tape live again Sunday nights at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at VOG Network.com.

1108
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And we will be back.

1109
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I mean, we didn't end up having any time off for the holidays just because these Sundays fell on pretty good days this year.

1110
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
So we will be back again next week.

1111
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Still looking at the potential of doing a roadshow in a couple weeks, which will be very exciting because we haven't done one of those in a very long time.

1112
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And I should be able to.

1113
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
So this is going to be very exciting.

1114
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But unfortunately, Loki, it'll probably be right when the kid's here, but it'll work out for at least us to go hopefully hang with some of the old school friends at O-L-R and some of our friends in the Bay Area.

1115
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
So it'll be a very different type of episode. It'll be fun.

1116
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Cool.

1117
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Alright.

1118
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.

1119
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1120
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I just unwrapped my present.

1121
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Oh, what'd you get?

1122
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
A lot of foil, which I am now wearing as a hat. Why? Because I can.

1123
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
It's very pretty.

1124
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
It's very blue, flowery, something.

1125
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I want to feel cool.

1126
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I actually want to go get some more to do decoupage with it just because it's so pretty.

1127
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And then I got a ThinkGeek shirt that says, I am here because you broke something.

1128
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
And that's always been true, but now that it's my full-time job, yes, please.

1129
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
How appropriate.

1130
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yeah, at the moment I saw that I was like, yeah, that's for him.

1131
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Did you try to nick it off and then on again?

1132
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Well, now I need to get one of those because I'm going to be working in tech support.

1133
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Make me a hat with this foil.

1134
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Okay.

1135
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Alright, anyhow, get that foil off my head because I can't see the news otherwise, so let's get to the news.

1136
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Loki, start us off tonight.

1137
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Alright, so usually when we report these types of stories, it's normally EA shutting down servers,

1138
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
but this time around it's actually going to be Sony.

1139
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
They're going to be shutting down their online servers for a few of the PlayStation 3 games that they have.

1140
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Starting off with the course, Gran Turismo 5 is going to be having their servers turned off May 20th next year,

1141
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and Resistance, the entire franchise, going down on March 28th.

1142
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Also, as of January 28th, they're going to be shutting down the online connectivity for MAG,

1143
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:40,000
SOCOM Special Forces, and SOCOM Confrontation, and SOCOM Confrontation and MAG.

1144
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Those are online-only games, so if you bought those, you're fucked.

1145
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Your game is over.

1146
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I kind of get the Gran Turismo 5 because they're trying to nudge people onto Gran Turismo 6,

1147
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:59,000
and I'm sure there's newer SOCOM games as well, but MAG, I kind of thought there was an audience still out there for that.

1148
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I could be wrong, but I kind of thought MAG still had a little loyal following to it because it was really about massive groups of people, right?

1149
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I guess if they're not achieving that anymore, I certainly don't have these numbers to back them up either,

1150
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and I know I was interested in the game, never actually wound up picking it up,

1151
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:21,000
but a game like that, if its numbers are dwindling, if they're not able to match-make and keep the 4A,

1152
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:28,000
the massive number melee going on, then why keep supporting the game? Why keep putting the time and money into it?

1153
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Robert, I always think that you should have an offline component to at least do some sort of LAN or something,

1154
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
because you have something that's not just a coaster when this is done.

1155
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Right. Let's see, I'm looking here in chat and Robert M says,

1156
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I thought MAG had already shut down. Well, no, they're shutting it down January 28th, 2014.

1157
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:55,000
It's just that this was actually announced some time ago in July of 2013 that they were going to shut it down.

1158
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So the news that it is shutting down is not necessarily new, but it is coming within the next few weeks.

1159
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Well, I guess folks have had six months to get used to the idea and try to sell the game second hand to an unsuspecting-

1160
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
No, don't do that, that's mean, that's mean. It's the risk you take with online games.

1161
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:20,000
If you think about it, even Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft, they'll all shut down someday.

1162
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
It'll be a long way away, but they'll shut down someday.

1163
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
XI is still active, isn't it?

1164
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Oh yeah, very much.

1165
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And there's no time, no expectation for that to go away.

1166
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
No. A game like that will be around forever, you know?

1167
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:41,000
But at least something like that that's a PC game, there's a chance that someone may be able to run a third-party server or something like that after the game is shut down.

1168
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Whereas something like this that's on PlayStation 3, there's no chance for that at all. You're out of luck.

1169
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I mean, yeah, maybe you're not playing the game, but I still think that there should always be at least some sort of an offline component.

1170
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I agree with that aspect of it, if not an offline component, then a self-hosted game, a self-hosted server that you can run for nostalgia's sake.

1171
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Yeah, they did that when they shut down Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

1172
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I wouldn't know.

1173
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Yeah, they did. They made it so that you could export your stuff and play on private servers, which is weird to see a company embrace that, but that was a really good thing, I think.

1174
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It helps aid the nostalgia and custom content and people that want to do whatever they want in the confines of their own system.

1175
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Like, what's the loss if something goes wrong? You're not liable for it anymore.

1176
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Maybe not to the letter of the law, but certainly with all practicality, this game's done. You're not affecting anybody else than the people that you invited to come play this game with you.

1177
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:48,000
But for nostalgia's sake, being able to continue to play the game, revisiting old gaming memories, that would be a good thing for MMO makers to adopt and continue to do.

1178
01:07:49,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And considering, too, that eventually, I'm assuming, I don't know if they're going to carry on the SOCOM brand to PlayStation 4, but you might want to have some of that stuff still available to play so that people might know what SOCOM is when the PlayStation 4 version comes around.

1179
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Unless it is truly a franchise that they're going to sunset. I mean, we don't know. That could be happening.

1180
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:24,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Zon's Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, snowflake.

1181
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Well, we shall move on with some more news. Jason?

1182
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:42,000
This week, Notch just left a post-Christmas dump in your New Year's wishes and dreams in claiming that despite the build-out of Minecraft, that there are currently no plans for a Minecraft on the Wii U.

1183
01:08:42,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Which, not to jump on a presumption in Nintendo, but considering the age of their player base, having a productive game, like everybody is astonished when they find out that somebody building something in Minecraft is absurdly young.

1184
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:11,000
You know, they're seven, they're eight, maybe even younger than that. And the Wii gamepad gives you at least a little bit more flexibility than a standard controller would.

1185
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I know a lot of people that just stick their kids in front of a laptop or a desktop and let them go to work, but for something like this that's a little bit more accessible, this comes as a huge surprise to me.

1186
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Because kids that I know really seem to enjoy Minecraft, and so to not extend it, you know, there could be political reasons, there could be time and effort reasons, and there are supporting reasons and monetary reasons.

1187
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It just seems like the Wii U would be a good expansive avenue for this, and to not take them up on that.

1188
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:54,000
It is so weird that they are resisting it, and it does seem political. I mean, not to be all tinfoil hat, but let's, you know, Dark Soccer did just give out some foil, so we have that part up.

1189
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It is not tinfoil, it's fake foil.

1190
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:05,000
But it at least gets us halfway to these conspiracy theories. No, but for real, like, you know, a map, duh, would be great on the Wii U gamepad.

1191
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I think just having your inventory screen and the crafting on the gamepad would make for a great experience. That's part of the biggest pain in the ass of Minecraft, is having to bring up the screen.

1192
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Where was I, man? You know, I think, oh my gosh, it would make so much sense on the Wii U, so it is very disappointing.

1193
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
That's why Nintendo won't do it, because it makes sense.

1194
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:31,000
It's return on investment is what it is. There's just not enough systems out there, and the people that buy games are just not there.

1195
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
That's a harsh reality. I wish they'd at least, if they're not going to do it on Wii U, at least look into some second screen stuff.

1196
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And maybe they will, with the PlayStation 4 and the Vita, who knows?

1197
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Or like a port to the 3DS.

1198
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Yeah, who knows? That's possible too.

1199
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Don't underestimate, though, guys, how huge Minecraft is with, like, kids. I'm always shocked.

1200
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Julian plays.

1201
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I'm always shocked at how many people I know with kids, and they're like, oh yeah, my kid plays Minecraft, and it probably needs not be said.

1202
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Not only just the kids. The whole freaking family!

1203
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, for real. But I'm just saying, like, there are a ton of people that play Minecraft.

1204
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Like, it is pretty astounding what that game's accomplished.

1205
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:15,000
There's a buddy of mine that runs a private server and has, you know, Bucket and all the mods, and there's an IRC room that we congregate in,

1206
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:22,000
and so he runs a plugin that bridges the conversation in Minecraft back to IRC two-way.

1207
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
And this wouldn't exist on a console, of course.

1208
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,000
But the expansiveness is what makes that game, and the game is built around expansion.

1209
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Or surviving, if you play survival, of course.

1210
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Or building stuff.

1211
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Expansion.

1212
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Like me.

1213
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Or digging holes. I get rid of stuff too.

1214
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:47,000
There is an immense amount of potential now, and I think last week we talked about, like, the long tail of Nintendo.

1215
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
There will not be an immediate return on investment, but it will happen because that game is popular.

1216
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That is, you know, that would be a huge title to make its way to Nintendo.

1217
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But current plans, unfortunately, ain't gonna happen for the foreseeable future.

1218
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
You know, I had to really resist picking up the PlayStation 3 version, but it's like,

1219
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
dude, you own it on the 360 and you own it on the PC, and how much did you really play it on the PC?

1220
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
But I've had this real bug to play Minecraft lately, so, Loki, we need to get that VoG server back.

1221
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Even if I've got a front of money for it, I think that we've got to make it happen.

1222
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
We can do it and you don't need a front of money for it. I just haven't gotten around.

1223
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I'll do it.

1224
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Yay! Alright, I'm excited.

1225
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It doesn't have to... Even if you bomb the server and start new and maybe, like, as a, like, easy mode monsters thing,

1226
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
where, you know, there's some challenge or something against, I think that'd be great.

1227
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I backed up the server, because they brought back the server for, like, a few days and I was able to back it all up.

1228
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
But, you know, it's old now compared to, you know, the updates and everything.

1229
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And also, you know, free mode gets boring after a while, because there's no real point,

1230
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
especially when there's not a lot of people playing at the same time. That's why survival's kind of nice.

1231
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

1232
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:04,000
See, my favorite thing was doing all the creative stuff, was digging holes and exploring, so I didn't really care about the other stuff.

1233
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Alright, and we've got some people in chat wanting to know when that's back up, so look forward to that.

1234
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Maybe that'll be something for 2014.

1235
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
But I do notice Robert M. in chat says,

1236
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I'm not planning on getting the PS3 Minecraft right now since,

1237
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
A, I'm too busy with the PC version in Pocket Edition,

1238
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
and to some extent, B, the sound design isn't really there yet,

1239
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
with the menu making huge metallic clunks and barely being able to hear blocks being picked up.

1240
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Honestly, though, I'm going to tell you what stopped me from getting it on PlayStation 3,

1241
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
is that we haven't heard what's happening with PlayStation 4 and Vita versions yet,

1242
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,000
and I want to wait and hear that, because will my PlayStation 3, is it going to be cross-play amongst all of them?

1243
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Because if so, fine, I'll invest the money in the PlayStation 3 version right now.

1244
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
But if it's not going to be cross-play and the PlayStation 4 is going to be different or whatever,

1245
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
then I'll probably just wait and get it on 4.

1246
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
It's going to be different on 4, I guarantee it,

1247
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,000
because that's why right now the PlayStation 3 version is basically a port of the Xbox 360 one,

1248
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
so 4 and Xbox One are going to have larger maps and probably more features.

1249
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Alright, fair enough. Well, let's move on.

1250
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in the news?

1251
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Well, Mass Effect stuff.

1252
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yay!

1253
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Well, as you guys know, on November 7th, which was N7 Day,

1254
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,000
we had a few tweets go in that showed some of the screens, not like full-on screenshots,

1255
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
but you could see computers in the background with a little bit here and there for the development of the next Mass Effect game.

1256
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:34,000
There was more news that came out by Aaron Flynn, who is the general manager of BioWare's Edmonton and Montreal studios,

1257
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
with just a photo of the computer that says BioWare.

1258
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And they're basically saying, and the tweet basically says,

1259
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Great time playing the next Mass Effect game in Montreal. Ambitious, beautiful, fresh, but recognizable and fun.

1260
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:57,000
So, and I'm, from what this is, it looks like it's just in the very early stages of level testing and design.

1261
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
What a fucking tease though.

1262
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I know.

1263
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I'm so excited and scared. Literally, I am Jesse Spano.

1264
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm so scared.

1265
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I am Jesse Spano in that scene when it was the new Mass Effect game.

1266
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I'm so excited. I'm so scared.

1267
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But it's not going to be a Shepard story. I'm a little scared, but I'm really excited to play.

1268
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Think about it. We will get that trailer at E3.

1269
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
By six months from now, we will know about this game, Dar Sacro. Yes, we will.

1270
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I know.

1271
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And it might make it for the holidays, although I kind of think spring 2015 is a little more realistic,

1272
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
but you never know if they can play it now.

1273
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I'm still going to play it. I don't care.

1274
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I was very irritated with how more human-centric the last game went.

1275
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I would like to see more expansion into the other species in the Mass Effect universe, but I'll wait and see what happens.

1276
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I'm going to reserve my judgment until I've actually, you know, got it in front of me playing it.

1277
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
That's how I feel.

1278
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That and it better have the same good multiplayer.

1279
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Right.

1280
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
That was pretty freaking awesome.

1281
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
At this point, you were talking about server shutdowns earlier in the show,

1282
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
and I'm kind of surprised they haven't threatened to pull the plug on Mass Effect 3 yet,

1283
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
but I'm sure there's still a lot of people that play online.

1284
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Oh, heck yeah.

1285
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
But I don't know about, like, Wii U, but who knows?

1286
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:22,000
It was so borked on Wii U just with the whole Genesis thing, and you didn't get all of your options.

1287
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
It's just sad.

1288
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Honestly, if you're going to get it on any system, get it on the Xbox, because you can totally mod your files.

1289
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
If you have to get a console and not PC.

1290
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
If you have to get a console.

1291
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates,

1292
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
although I have a feeling there's not going to be much, but it's a part of the show we always do.

1293
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So, Loki, how's the US look for release dates?

1294
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Nothing.

1295
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Nothing?

1296
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Nothing.

1297
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Not a damn thing coming out this week.

1298
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
You know, let's travel to Japan and take a look and see if anything's coming out there.

1299
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I kind of don't think so.

1300
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I was a little slow in bringing it up here, so sorry, guys.

1301
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
They still do not have PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, remember.

1302
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
That is coming out later.

1303
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Okay, Mafia 2 gets a price reduction, and there's some third-party game pads on the PlayStation 3 on December 31st.

1304
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
That's something, right?

1305
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
How about on the Xbox 360?

1306
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Okay, nothing on the Xbox 360.

1307
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
What about on the handhelds?

1308
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
How about on the Vita or the 3DS?

1309
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Nothing on the Vita.

1310
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And 3DS gets Puzzle and Dragons Z.

1311
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Oh, never mind.

1312
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Those are just decorative things.

1313
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So, is Puzzle and Dragons really big on 3DS over there?

1314
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
That's kind of weird.

1315
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Because I thought that I did not like the phone game at all.

1316
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But I guess I know some people that are into it, so whatever makes you happy, I guess.

1317
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
It doesn't matter if there's something out there.

1318
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Someone's gonna like it and everyone else is gonna hate it.

1319
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
That's true.

1320
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Yeah, I'm looking at the other systems like the PSP and so forth.

1321
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Nada nada nada.

1322
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
So, nothing in Japan, really, this week except that one price reduction and some peripherals.

1323
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Dark soccer?

1324
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Jack and shit.

1325
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I figured.

1326
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
For the UK.

1327
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yep.

1328
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Nothing.

1329
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Alright.

1330
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I'm sorry.

1331
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Fuck all.

1332
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Fuck all's coming out.

1333
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
You've got enough games to play right now is the moral of this story.

1334
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Steam!

1335
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Release dates.

1336
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Absolutely nothing.

1337
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Alright.

1338
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1339
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Loki.

1340
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Alright.

1341
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So, unfortunately, one of the games I was actually looking forward to next year, No

1342
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Man's Sky.

1343
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:34,000
The developer, Hello Games, suffered some flood damage over the week and it took out

1344
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
some of their servers and PCs and stuff like that.

1345
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Monitors, furniture, a bunch of other stuff.

1346
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I'm not sure if that necessarily, obviously that might affect some of the development

1347
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,000
of the game but they haven't really said that anything's been delayed yet.

1348
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I'm sure they have all that stuff backed up anyways.

1349
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And then also they're saying they're not really insured for the flood damage but hopefully

1350
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
they may get some sort of help from Microsoft.

1351
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I guess they're saying Phil Spencer said he might be able to look into helping them

1352
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
out.

1353
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I don't know.

1354
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
They'll see.

1355
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Maybe they'll do some funding stuff to recover some of the things that they had that need

1356
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
to be replaced.

1357
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
It kind of sucks that they didn't have flood insurance.

1358
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I'm not really sure in the area that they're at if it's prone to flooding or if this

1359
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
is just some freak thing.

1360
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It sucks either way.

1361
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I mean it's really unfortunate but these mother nature events or as they call them

1362
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
acts of God or whatever, these things are going to happen.

1363
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Just a solemn reminder to have an emergency plan no matter who you are, what you do, what

1364
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,000
are you going to do if there's a fire or there's an earthquake or a tornado or whatever

1365
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
it is where you live.

1366
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Always put your offices on the second floor.

1367
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Yeah, right.

1368
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Right.

1369
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So, yeah.

1370
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Well, good luck to them though.

1371
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I hope they're able to make a recovery because that No Man's Sky did look very interesting

1372
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
even though for some reason it's the one game they didn't show on TV which was kind of shitty

1373
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
but it was a good trailer.

1374
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yeah.

1375
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
All right.

1376
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Ray Jinder says that games are like Pokemans.

1377
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
You got to get them all.

1378
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
No, you don't.

1379
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
You can't get them all.

1380
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
You can't.

1381
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
No, no, no, but you really don't need to because there are games that stink on ice.

1382
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
That's very true.

1383
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
We didn't talk about the worst games of the year but there's plenty of them.

1384
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
What, like Aliens, Colonial Marines?

1385
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
If they were worst games, I'd play them.

1386
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
You don't play bad games.

1387
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I don't waste my time with bad games.

1388
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
All right.

1389
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Well, I don't know if you guys heard over the holidays but all the networks online were

1390
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
getting hammered.

1391
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
PlayStation Network shut down for an amount of time.

1392
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Xbox Live was down.

1393
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I don't think it was down quite as long as the others but it was down for a little bit

1394
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and Nintendo got hammered as well.

1395
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And Nintendo, you know, very apologetic via their Facebook page saying the problem, the

1396
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,000
reason why Nintendo Network went down is because the influx of Nintendo Network accounts being

1397
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
created and trying to get onto the eShop.

1398
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Well, okay, when you sell a 3DS with a eShop copy of a game that a lot of people want to

1399
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
play, I mean...

1400
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Translation.

1401
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Because of y'all greedy bitches.

1402
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I don't even think it's necessarily that they're greedy but it's just here we go again with

1403
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:27,000
poor planning especially when it comes to network stuff and it's a bad trend for games.

1404
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Speaking of some of the worst games of the year, calling out SimCity.

1405
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Now, I personally am not calling it out because I'm going to be honest, I didn't play it but

1406
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I was hearing about a bunch of the fuckery with that game and the online servers and

1407
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
everything and, you know, we all know what that game went through and they didn't expect

1408
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
the influx of people they were going to have and so forth and it really made people angry

1409
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
that a game that they were used to being offline kind of had to be online.

1410
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Now, maybe a little bit apples to oranges is what I'm saying there because obviously

1411
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
a 3DS does not require you to be online but Nintendo certainly took strides with their

1412
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
latest patch and by only bundling in the eShop version of some of these games on some of

1413
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
their consoles, you know, they were kind of asking for it on Christmas Day so you kind

1414
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
of look at something like this and you go, Nintendo, y'all got no one to blame but yourself.

1415
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You know, and your poor planning.

1416
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And also, I'm curious actually how many consoles they sold because, you know, if they didn't

1417
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
sell that many and they couldn't, you know, handle the influx of like, you know, a couple

1418
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
thousand, you know, people then I'd be a little curious.

1419
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Yeah, but it's not just the Wii U Loki, it's the 3DS.

1420
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I understand that but, you know, come on, I mean, they know how many consoles they're

1421
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
putting out.

1422
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Well, anyhow, the Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DS was taken down and last we heard it was

1423
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
supposed to be back up 4 a.m. today.

1424
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I haven't checked to see if it was back up.

1425
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I think it is.

1426
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I've seen Miiverse has been pretty active and so forth so I think things are running

1427
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
again over there.

1428
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
But yeah, that was not so great.

1429
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Also, kind of as a snowball effect, the Pokemon Bank was supposed to come out on December

1430
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
27th.

1431
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,000
It was out and then it got pulled with no Western launch yet announced because this

1432
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
was supposed to come out here as well.

1433
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And the Pokemon Bank was the new system where you were going to be able to take Pokemon

1434
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
from X and Y and put them in the cloud.

1435
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
This is how you were going to be able to transfer Pokemon to future games and, you know, no

1436
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
matter what system Nintendo has Pokemon out on next, you'd be able to transfer things

1437
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
through the cloud.

1438
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So because of the network difficulties, they pulled the game because they wanted people

1439
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
to stop trying to get the game.

1440
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
It's causing too much bandwidth.

1441
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Again, you should have known when you put all this shit out at once, something like

1442
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
this would happen.

1443
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
So shame, shame.

1444
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
But for better or worse, they did delay this a little bit.

1445
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Your Pokemon in the cloud?

1446
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Nintendo used Fly.

1447
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
It wasn't very effective.

1448
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Womp, womp.

1449
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Fired!

1450
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
All right.

1451
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Anyhow, if you want to try Pokemon Bank, you're supposed to be able to download until January

1452
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:09,000
31st, 2014 and be able to download a 30-day trial and then it will be $5 a year.

1453
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And if you access the bank before September 30th of 2014, you'll get Celebi for free.

1454
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So there you go.

1455
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
3,000 Pokemon can go in the bank and it will...

1456
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Did you say Celebi-see?

1457
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
No, Celebi.

1458
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Oh.

1459
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
It will work with Pokemon Black, White, Black 2, White 2 through the Poke Transporter and

1460
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
X and Y.

1461
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
So that's how you can get those generations in there as well and then whatever happens

1462
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
next.

1463
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So there you go.

1464
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
But unfortunately, we don't know when that will come out, but I'm assuming probably in

1465
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
the first week of January is when they're going to push that back.

1466
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
And it will probably have a very quiet launch because they don't want everybody to hit it

1467
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
at once.

1468
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
But once it hits the internet, open the floodgates!

1469
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Fifth Dream in chat saying the Pokemons are clogging up our clouds.

1470
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Yeah, that is kind of what happened.

1471
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
It's like in Wall-E when the ship was trying to escape and it just blew through all of

1472
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
the satellite data, all the satellites from it.

1473
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Right?

1474
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane where you know what?

1475
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
You didn't have games in the cloud.

1476
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It was right in front of your damn face.

1477
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Your head was still in the cloud, but the games weren't up there.

1478
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
That's right.

1479
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Maybe in this game, though, you were in the clouds.

1480
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I don't know.

1481
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Let's see.

1482
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
We're going to take a trip back to the classic game of the week.

1483
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Dark Sakura's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

1484
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
you brats should play this game or I'll kill you.

1485
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1486
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I actually picked something a little on the obscure side.

1487
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I picked Ordine.

1488
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Ordine it is.

1489
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Which was a game put out by Namco.

1490
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Basically, I'm picking up the Namco games that were featured in Namco High because some

1491
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
people have no idea where the fuck these games came from.

1492
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And I've actually done some of them for classic game.

1493
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,000
So I picked Ordine, which is basically you're in a little plane shooting shit down.

1494
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:06,000
And you have characters named Yuichiro Tomari, who is a scientist and the main protagonist

1495
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
and you get a red ship.

1496
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And then you get Sun Daichin, who is a Chinese assistant and the pilot of the green ship.

1497
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
You get Kana Ayahara, who is Tomari's fiance.

1498
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You get Dr. Kubota, who is the main antagonist.

1499
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,000
You get Miki-chan, who is a shopkeeper and Dream Company Limited, who is a robot who

1500
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
flies around and helps you.

1501
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And basically, it's just a really cute little shooter.

1502
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
You get all the usual power-ups, you know.

1503
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,000
And the thing about this is that it came out in 1988.

1504
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So it's one of those Namco System 2 hardware games.

1505
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And it came out on PC Engine in 1989.

1506
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And it came out for the TurboGrafx in 1990.

1507
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
It's in the Namco Museum Volume 4.

1508
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
And it has come out on the North American Virtual Console.

1509
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So it's just a cute...

1510
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It did?

1511
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Yes, it did.

1512
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Wow.

1513
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It's just a cute little game.

1514
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I haven't played this ever.

1515
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
It was actually advertised as a comical shooter.

1516
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I gotta be honest.

1517
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It looks a lot like Fantasy Zone.

1518
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
A lot, a lot like Fantasy Zone.

1519
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Yeah, it does.

1520
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
It has that same cartoony, cutesy style.

1521
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

1522
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Now, the one thing about this, though, is that...

1523
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It's like a little shop.

1524
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
He just flew in the shop, like you do in Fantasy Zone.

1525
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Exactly, exactly.

1526
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
With this particular one, you basically...

1527
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Like, for example, Miyuki-chan will stop by, like you were just saying.

1528
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:37,000
When Dream Company passes by, you can win crystals to buy weapons.

1529
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:43,000
But you have one-hit kills, but you can buy your extra lives as you go through the game.

1530
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
It's just a cutesy little game.

1531
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I mean, it was fun.

1532
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Not a whole bunch extra special to it.

1533
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Oh, they do like a little celebration dance when they clear the round.

1534
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And I do believe that this is the one that Albatross was from in Namco High.

1535
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:06,000
So, whenever you guys see Albatross or Al-b-tross, as he is also known in that, this is the game he is from.

1536
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I'm going to double-check it, just to make sure, but I'm pretty sure that is it.

1537
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And that's your classic game.

1538
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
What's this? Some type of roulette game that's in there, too?

1539
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Like little gambling games?

1540
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Yeah, that's when you run into the robot.

1541
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Oh, okay.

1542
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Pretty cool. Alright.

1543
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I'm just double-checking.

1544
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I have to admit, I had never played this game before, but I kind of want to...

1545
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I wish it was on one of the newer retro game collections so I could check it out.

1546
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
But there it is.

1547
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Your classic game of the week, boys and girls, or dine, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1548
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Good pick, Dark Soccer. I like it when you pick things I haven't heard of.

1549
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:44,000
And also, just to say, you know, again, if you haven't played Namco High, it's really fucking fun.

1550
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And it'll work on your phone because it is HTML5.

1551
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Alright.

1552
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I'm double-checking on the students one more time, just so I can be sure.

1553
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And it's not loading up, so...

1554
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Sorry. I'll probably be able to tell you guys soon.

1555
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Alright, well, maybe she can tell us after the break, because it is that time to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1556
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
But we've got plenty more show when we come back.

1557
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I was wrong. Albatross is from Rolling Thunder. I don't know what I was thinking.

1558
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Alright.

1559
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yes, there's not as much news tonight, so we're flying through that a little quickly.

1560
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
But we do still have the mailbag. We have the FUGL question of the week coming up.

1561
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
We have your phone calls a little later in the show.

1562
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And also, Listless tonight! It's been a long time.

1563
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It was Tamari. I don't even know what I was thinking.

1564
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Because Albatross is from Rolling Thunder, and it's another of those weird Namco games, so...

1565
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
My brain went fart.

1566
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Are you sure you're done? Because I'm trying to get us to break.

1567
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Yeah, it was Tamari. It was Tamari.

1568
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Listless. 2014 predictions. FUGL. FUs of the week. Twitter calls. Sure. We'll call Twitter. Why not?

1569
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
We'll do it all here on the last episode of OLR.

1570
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Twitter call-outs.

1571
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
For 2013. Right after this.

1572
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1573
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:09,000
We are live with our last episode of 2013 for this Sunday, December 29th.

1574
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,000
And it is episode number 533 of our show, already in progress.

1575
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And a big hello to all of you guys there listening live at The Voice of Geeks Network.

1576
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Live.vognetwork.com.

1577
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And those of you listening to us on the podcast feed as well, be it through, I don't know, iTunes Podcast, or Stitcher, or TuneIn, or any of those.

1578
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
A big hello to you guys as well.

1579
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Do remember, since those of you who listen on the podcast, there's a passphrase hidden somewhere in the show that you can punch into the website at vognetwork.com.

1580
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And if you want, you can use those points to enter the raffle.

1581
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
And you don't have much time left. In fact, if it's after January 1st, you already missed out for the month.

1582
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:54,000
But we're giving away a $20 gift card to many popular gaming services such as, you know, Nintendo Network and Xbox Live and so forth.

1583
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Why are we giving it away? Because we want you guys to visit vognetwork.com, of course.

1584
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And just because we love you guys for supporting the network and participating in the show.

1585
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
So it's us to give a little something back to you guys.

1586
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
So be sure to check that out over at vognetwork.com.

1587
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Also YouTube.

1588
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Yes. Jason, you've been working very hard on those YouTubes, I gotta say. And thank you for reminding me.

1589
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:23,000
We just put up last week, we just put, because YouTube is, again, YouTube runs one week behind, six days-ish, one week behind.

1590
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Just because we prefer to have folks listen via the places that really give us ratings instead of giving Google ratings, giving us ratings first.

1591
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
But then, you know, we like having it on YouTube for discovery purposes.

1592
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And, starting with last week's episode, Jason, I don't know if you really plan on taking that level of effort every week, but I was very impressed.

1593
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:50,000
You kind of made it more of like an archive where you actually, like, bookmarked all the sections of the show and, like, very easy to find a part of the show you're looking for.

1594
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Some video synced up and things.

1595
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Well, the video is always gonna sync up, otherwise I just completely screwed something up.

1596
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:13,000
But, no, I want to start doing more and more, and basically, I finally sat down and did chapters, and it's, you know, every time I do this, I'm coming up with new ideas, and I'm going to take it as they come to me.

1597
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:21,000
It's like, you know what, we do the same thing. We've been on the air next year again, our twelfth broadcast year, tonight we're trying something new.

1598
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
You guys don't know what it is yet, we'll surprise you a little later, I'll tell you what it is, but we're doing something new tonight.

1599
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It's just how you always kind of think, like, how can I do that, how can I take this one step?

1600
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And I've also, like I've said previously as well, I've also never done video work before, and it's always been an incredible interest to me.

1601
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:48,000
And so this is one part learning design, this is one part doing video editing, this is one part being able to do a lot of post-production.

1602
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Yeah, I'm contributing in ways that are very fun for me, and I plan to continue doing so and doing better each time.

1603
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Yeah, do what you love, that's why I do this. And you know, since it is that sappy time of year, since we're getting towards the end of the year, one thing I'm going to put out there,

1604
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I got a pretty big promotion at work this year, which I'm very thankful for, I really like what I do for a living at my day job, and so forth,

1605
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:18,000
but part of the reason, and part of the stuff that played into that promotion that I got, was that it was recognized, some of the stuff I do outside of work,

1606
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:27,000
and that I work with audio and video and that type of production and things kind of outside of work, and that all plays into now, you know, what I do with my day job.

1607
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:34,000
So like, you know, all these years later, OLR has actually like helped me get a job in a way, it's so weird!

1608
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,000
But I'm so thankful for it, and thank you guys for supporting it, absolutely.

1609
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I got a job too.

1610
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
That's right, you got a job as well.

1611
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I'm not going to say where I'm working.

1612
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Yes.

1613
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I'm glad that you actually know me in person, just because given the nature of the job, I don't really want to...

1614
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Completely understand.

1615
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:01,000
But I will be doing some tech support, and that will be fun, but for every...

1616
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And this is the thing that floored me, is that I just happened to put it on my Facebook like I normally do,

1617
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I'm so happy I got a job, 120 people.

1618
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I was like, how do I know that many people?

1619
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
So I want to thank everyone who supported me in my attempts to find gainful employment.

1620
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Thank you people who were just being happy for me, because that means a lot to me too.

1621
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:31,000
You know, just a lot of selfless people I want to thank, so thank you.

1622
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:39,000
And also listening to the break music makes me really want to watch Swing Girls again,

1623
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
because Mexican Flyer is one of the songs they do for the finale.

1624
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
We played some Space Channel 5 music here live, which I can't repeat on the podcast,

1625
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:52,000
and we would especially not own that on YouTube, we get a copyright shutdown.

1626
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Actually, I don't know if Mexican Flyer is back in the public domain.

1627
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Well, the Sega version definitely isn't.

1628
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Well, no, but it is big band swing music, which really brought that genre into the fore.

1629
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
So Actif says that we're happy because you're happy. Thank you.

1630
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And I got to give an arm of support to our buddy Brad over at Pod Culture,

1631
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
because he's job hunting right now and he's looking for something.

1632
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Well, it took me three years, so I hope it doesn't take you that long.

1633
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
But we are keeping our fingers and toes crossed for our friend Brad,

1634
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:30,000
and if you need a really smart guy who produces a solid podcast about sci-fi and geek culture

1635
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
and a little bit of games and a little bit of everything, hire Brad. Absolutely.

1636
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I do have to say it was very encouraging when I took the small tour. TARDIS posters.

1637
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Oh, quickly. Since it is the voice of geeks network and people are talking not just video games,

1638
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,000
but did you watch The Doctor Who? I'm so behind on Doctor Who.

1639
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I haven't watched it yet, but someone spoiled The Regeneration for me.

1640
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
We all knew who the new Doctor was going to be and when it was going to happen.

1641
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I'm just expecting him to break out into a string of curses, as Peter Capaldi.

1642
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,000
But I did actually, though, I had to go back and watch the anniversary special while I was downloading it,

1643
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
just because, ah, David Tennant.

1644
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:20,000
That's on my list. While I game, I'm hoping that when we move and get our new place and our new office,

1645
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I'll be able to have a little TV so I can catch up on things like Doctor Who and stuff.

1646
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
You know, a little person who has the episodes on her hard drive.

1647
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
What's on Netflix too? This past season?

1648
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I don't know about the most recent season, but I only got halfway through the ninth Doctor,

1649
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
and it's not because I didn't like it. I loved it.

1650
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I have that box set. I need to get that back for my friend.

1651
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I don't watch hardly any TV. When I finished Orange is the New Black,

1652
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
that was a miracle that I actually had the attention span to watch 13 hours worth of TV.

1653
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:54,000
At any rate, since I mentioned it, if nobody out there has seen Swing Girls, you can find it.

1654
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
It's inexpensive now. Great little movie, and yes, it has subtitles.

1655
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,000
But I just have to say, if you like the music in Space Channel 5, get into big band.

1656
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
There you go. There you go. Loki, you still there with us?

1657
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Nope, he took a breath. Oh no, he's there. Hey!

1658
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
It's so weird when I can't see you, but Loki Baby Watch is on,

1659
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
which is why Loki is on Skype with us for a few weeks here.

1660
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
But, Loki, any plans for the new year?

1661
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
No, not really.

1662
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Since Josh dressed up like a firework for Halloween, is he excited about New Year's Eve,

1663
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
or do you guys try not to get him too worked up about that?

1664
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Nah, he doesn't stand for any of that stuff. He doesn't know what's going on.

1665
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
He doesn't know, huh?

1666
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
He has trouble figuring out what day it is during the day.

1667
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,000
He thinks when he goes down for a nap or something like that, that's another day.

1668
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And so he doesn't understand time right now.

1669
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Still young.

1670
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
You and the jokes need to stop.

1671
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I never will.

1672
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I know, I know. Alright.

1673
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
You want the intern Drew position here.

1674
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

1675
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Alright, so next month they've got some pretty decent stuff on PlayStation Plus.

1676
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:18,000
And I'm kind of excited about this in case you haven't played it yet.

1677
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Bioshock Infinite is going to be one of the titles they've given away free.

1678
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Devil May Cry, also Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons.

1679
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:30,000
And they're going to have some stuff for the Vita as well.

1680
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Smart As and Warms Battle Islands.

1681
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
And Don't Starve will be available for PlayStation 4.

1682
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
So, not bad.

1683
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I'm really curious to see Microsoft step it up for the Xbox, you know, Games with Gold thing.

1684
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Because it's kind of hard to compete with Bioshock Infinite and Devil May Cry.

1685
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Games that literally came out one year ago.

1686
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Yeah, Sony's kind of on a tear with their PlayStation Plus.

1687
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Not only their free games, but their discounts and everything too.

1688
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
They're making huge waves in this.

1689
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And, you know, especially considering as long as you purchase them, put them in your catalog,

1690
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,000
the ability to recall them later and play them in a later month is fantastic.

1691
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:19,000
There was the suggestions going around that even if you don't have a PS4 yet,

1692
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
if you pick up, well, there's no free Plus titles for four, not retail.

1693
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
But if you are a Plus subscriber, even if you don't have the system,

1694
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:35,000
you can still buy it online and redownload it in the future, which is pretty damn fantastic.

1695
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:41,000
And I've been doing that even though I've been away from my PlayStation 3 for two, three months.

1696
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Yeah, so I'm looking forward to it and definitely recommend anyone that hasn't played Bioshock Infinite.

1697
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Definitely give it a try if you have PlayStation Plus. It's worth it.

1698
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:02,000
And then the first round of Grand Theft Auto online jobs.

1699
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:09,000
These are created with the new Deathmatch and Race online creation tools that they released,

1700
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I think, literally a week or so ago.

1701
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
And so these are now Rockstar verified jobs.

1702
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:22,000
They have basically picked six races and four deathmatches that now will be kind of appearing everywhere online,

1703
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
like the official Rockstar matches. And so that's kind of cool.

1704
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
And they actually do have a system in there, as you may have seen,

1705
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:35,000
with the actual official jobs where you can upvote or downvote or just not vote on different things.

1706
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
And based on those and the more popular ones, they will become verified,

1707
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
and you'll actually see them as part of the regular playlists and stuff.

1708
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
So I thought that was pretty cool.

1709
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I know it didn't bleed through, but tell me if I'm crazy.

1710
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
You two here in studio just heard that siren, didn't you?

1711
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
The what?

1712
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
The siren?

1713
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
No.

1714
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
There was an emergency siren that just went hauling in three...

1715
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Oh, in this neighborhood? I don't doubt it.

1716
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
It was just well-timed.

1717
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
A Grand Theft Auto story and the police are here?

1718
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Exactly.

1719
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Absolutely.

1720
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Works.

1721
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
All right.

1722
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Well, I got a couple stories for you guys.

1723
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Another story about Doom. What's up with this?

1724
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
It's like a blast from the past tonight with all this Doom story.

1725
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
But VXJ and XV, tell me if you've heard about this one.

1726
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
There's a mod for Doom that puts...

1727
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
A mod for Doom? No.

1728
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Yes, it puts Resident Evil 4's Mercenaries mode within Doom.

1729
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
That's cool.

1730
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
So there's actually a little video of this here that I'll play.

1731
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Sorry, Jason.

1732
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
It's very loud, but you see them going through the menu here,

1733
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
and it's got the Resident Evil 4 stuff in here.

1734
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Leon S. Kennedy.

1735
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
It looks like you can play as different characters there.

1736
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Leon's one of them.

1737
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Let's see there.

1738
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And for the chatters and podcast listeners...

1739
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
That's right.

1740
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
You can go to youtube.com slash orangelandradio

1741
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
and view the video that we were watching just now.

1742
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Not the best radio, but the video will exist in a week.

1743
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Just so you know, so you can have this.

1744
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
You do need a copy of Doom, and you have to have its multiplayer mods

1745
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
in order to run this mod.

1746
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
It's only about 85% complete now.

1747
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Now we're finally getting into some gameplay there.

1748
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Oh, that's a very recognizable Doom.

1749
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
It's almost like they took Doom and made it over the shoulder.

1750
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Oh, he did the neck breaker.

1751
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Very Resident Evil 4 style.

1752
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Oh, yeah.

1753
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
With all the little pop-ups that come up at the bottom there.

1754
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
That's pretty cool.

1755
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I like that.

1756
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
So, yeah, he needs the multiplayer mods, and that's very awesome.

1757
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Where can you check that out?

1758
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I need to...

1759
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
It's linked in this article.

1760
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Yeah.

1761
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Was it?

1762
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
That's almost as cool as...

1763
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
VigLink.com. It's like buried.

1764
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
That is almost as cool as ASCII Quake.

1765
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
It actually just goes to Mediafire, so it's literally just a no-name dump.

1766
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Yeah, somebody's hosting site there.

1767
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Well, just Google Domero.

1768
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
D-O-O-M. Doom Arrow.

1769
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
D-O-O-M-E-R-O, and you can find his immersive mod.

1770
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
That one's pretty cool.

1771
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Although, my favorite Doom mod to this day is still Gatchaman Doom.

1772
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
All right.

1773
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
So, yeah, check that out.

1774
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
All right.

1775
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Also, a quick story here.

1776
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Final Fantasy X-3.

1777
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
What?

1778
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
That's right.

1779
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Not X-2, but X-3.

1780
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Hold on. Sit down.

1781
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Put your pants on.

1782
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
It's not confirmed.

1783
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:34,000
It's just that Kazushige Nojima, who was a scenario writer on the Final Fantasy series,

1784
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:40,000
he wants to see Final Fantasy X-3 and says it may happen if fans want it enough.

1785
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
And this is from a book from the Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters,

1786
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
because those just launched in Japan this week.

1787
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
We gotta wait for it for next year, but it is already out in Japan.

1788
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
And here's the quote.

1789
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Quote, if there's enough demand, then we may possibly see new developments.

1790
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I would personally like to see a sequel like X-3.

1791
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:01,000
So, I mean, we're gonna get a X-13-3 with Lightning Returns, so it's...

1792
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
They just need to shut up and give us another 7 or something.

1793
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I'm gonna say the same thing.

1794
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Where's my damn 7?

1795
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
What's your remake?

1796
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I got a full immersive remake of 6.

1797
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Alright, well, if you want to show your support, March 18th is the big day

1798
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
when these games come out in North America.

1799
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
If you're in Europe, you gotta wait just a couple more days.

1800
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
March 21st.

1801
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
So check those out.

1802
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1803
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Oh, I was just saying that my villager wants to kill Ed.

1804
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
We had a message in chat from...

1805
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Who doesn't?

1806
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
They're talking about modding all the Doom stuff,

1807
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
and then Tech2030 says, seriously, Animal Crossing mod where the villager shoots everything?

1808
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
And I said, my villager wants to kill Ed, because he won't leave my damn village.

1809
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I hate Ed.

1810
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
And you've consistently hit him with bug nets.

1811
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Now I'm just ignoring him.

1812
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And I had him almost fully ignored and then accidentally talked to him.

1813
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Have you been writing him hateful notes?

1814
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
You can't.

1815
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
If you want him to leave, you have to ignore him.

1816
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And I'm like, I just want to murder him with my shovel.

1817
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Or embed the axe in his stupid horse head.

1818
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
And then bury him with the shovel and see if he grows into an Ed tree.

1819
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
No, no, no.

1820
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
He's not even worth being fertilizer, okay?

1821
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Or glue.

1822
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Or glue. Or even food.

1823
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Or jello.

1824
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
This is going to a dark place. Let's move on.

1825
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Super Punch Out!

1826
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Ha ha ha.

1827
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Uppercut, uppercut.

1828
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Super Punch Out is on Nintendo eShop for Wii U.

1829
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
And you can get it.

1830
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
It came out in 1984 originally.

1831
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,000
And it came out on Virtual Console for the Wii in 2009.

1832
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:44,000
And now it's going to be on Wii U Virtual Console for 8 bucks.

1833
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I'd buy that for a dollar. Not really.

1834
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Well, if you bought it on Wii, then it will cost you just a dollar.

1835
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I think a dollar fifty gets a Super Nintendo.

1836
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Well, and also now for the PS3 people,

1837
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:01,000
there are two games coming out in Japan for PS3.

1838
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
That is going to be Raiden 4.

1839
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Oh my god. I'm so happy. I have to import that shit.

1840
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Because I love...

1841
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,000
No, Dan and I were just listening to comparisons of the first Raiden game

1842
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
on different consoles trying to listen to the music.

1843
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
And found some were really awful.

1844
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Did you know the Lynx version doesn't have any music?

1845
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
And it's really terrible.

1846
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
And the other game coming out is Colladrius.

1847
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
So, yeah. Raiden 4 is going to be Raiden Overkill.

1848
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
And then Colladrius is going to be out in 2014 as well.

1849
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
So there you go.

1850
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Alrighty. Let's take a trip to our Foogle question of the week.

1851
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
You take Facebook and you take Google Plus

1852
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
and you slam them together and you get Foogle.

1853
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
We're going to go over to our Facebook and Google Plus communities

1854
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
where we're going to see some answers to our question,

1855
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
which is very simple this week.

1856
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
It's a holiday show for the last show of the year.

1857
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
So what is one very popular thing people like to do this time of year?

1858
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
New Year's resolutions.

1859
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Which, you know, for better or worse, people do them.

1860
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
So we thought we'd ask our listeners,

1861
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
alright, it's the last show of 2013.

1862
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Do you have any gaming New Year's resolutions?

1863
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Things you must do in 2014?

1864
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
For example, part of what I kind of thought of was the dark soccer on the show.

1865
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
It wasn't a resolution per se, but she came out and said,

1866
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
you know what, I want to play one new game a week.

1867
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
And I thought, oh, that's a good thing to kind of aspire to.

1868
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I think I'm going to be using DVR as my interval training.

1869
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
So that's kind of your resolution in a way.

1870
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Yeah, I mean, I hate to use my whole exercise thing as a resolution,

1871
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,000
but I want to use DVR and other physical games as part of my training regimen.

1872
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Alright. Fair enough.

1873
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
So let's see what some of our listeners said.

1874
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Let's go over to Google+, where actdef said, get a better gaming PC.

1875
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Also, getting an HDTV is one of my top gaming priorities.

1876
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,000
But, of course, like every year, my top resolution is finishing my massive backlog of games.

1877
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Redertainment says, must accomplish project buy a house.

1878
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Now, I'm assuming that's not an Animal Crossing reference, but it very well could be.

1879
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
That's also on my list, too.

1880
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Actually, now that I'm going to be working, Dan and I are buying a house.

1881
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Moving to a nicer studio for OLR is definitely on top of my list.

1882
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
That could probably happen if we buy said house.

1883
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Well, it'll be a race.

1884
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Anyhow, let's go over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there.

1885
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
We had quite a few answers over there, but I'm in a good mood.

1886
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
We didn't have a lot of news tonight, so we should get through most of these.

1887
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Andy R. says, finish more of the games I buy. Damn Steam sales aren't helping.

1888
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Critical Myth says, resolve to finish Mass Effect 3.

1889
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Play the two Dragon Age games and do even more Assassin's Creed cosplay.

1890
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Only finish Mass Effect 3 if you have the extended cut DLC downloaded and ready to go.

1891
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Do it if you have it.

1892
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Even if you're like, but I want to see what it was like beforehand first.

1893
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
No, you don't want to.

1894
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
No, you don't.

1895
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I made that mistake.

1896
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I watched them on the internet and I was like, download.

1897
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Exactly.

1898
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I waited to beat my game so I could download the extended cut.

1899
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
There you go.

1900
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
All right, going on to Fifth Dream.

1901
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I don't believe in making resolutions because I don't keep them.

1902
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,000
But if I did, it would be to stop hoarding games like a squirrel and his nuts in winter.

1903
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I seriously probably have more games right now than I've played only once or never than all the other games I've had in my life.

1904
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Sure, most cost $1.50 to $10, but still I have that same problem.

1905
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Same problem.

1906
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Degenerate Johnny says, I vow to catch them all this year.

1907
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Catch what, you might ask?

1908
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I'll leave it to your imagination.

1909
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
You better have a good doctor.

1910
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
He means all the cards in Hearthstone, obviously.

1911
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Tech 2030 says, with a new Tales game and Tales HD rerelease coming out next year, I want to go back and play through all the Tales of English releases.

1912
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I'll get to replay the ones I finished and finally get to play through the ones sitting in my backlog.

1913
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Liam responded and said, to stop buying games I'm interested in on release at full price and I already have a stack of games to work through.

1914
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Instead, I'll wait for the price to drop.

1915
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Case in point, there's no way I'm spending 55 pounds on Tomb Raider Definitive Edition.

1916
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
It's euros, isn't it?

1917
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
No, euro is the little e with the...

1918
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I need somebody culturally...

1919
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Thank you.

1920
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Well, I lose.

1921
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Alright.

1922
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Our buddy Jeremy Jay from Koopa Club responded and said, my resolution is to finally play through all of the main series Dragon Quest and Warrior games.

1923
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
It's one of my favorite series, even though I've only played four of them with any seriousness.

1924
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I need to do that someday, too.

1925
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Dragon Quest VIII on PlayStation 2 was so good.

1926
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
And who doesn't love the first one?

1927
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Because we all got that strategy guide, right?

1928
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Good pick.

1929
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
And then you can replay the silver lining as well.

1930
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Flashback to three, four years ago, OR.

1931
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Alright.

1932
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I actually put the symbols in chat because they do look rather similar at a glance.

1933
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Yeah, from far away, too.

1934
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Daniel S. replied and said, my gaming resolution is to stick to my game and not just jump from game to game.

1935
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Good luck.

1936
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
To do this, I vow to get at least three platinum trophies in 2014.

1937
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Codeman responds and says, I would really like to dive more into Final Fantasy XIV.

1938
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Took a little while off and now everybody has multiple 50s and it's crazy.

1939
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I may have gotten my second 50 this week.

1940
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I would just like to be more involved with a free company and run dungeons more, etc, etc.

1941
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Now just to find the time.

1942
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Well, you know what they say, real life greater than games.

1943
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Yeah, that's been my thing.

1944
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Well, I'm still only 30.

1945
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Clover, well, the good thing is that game has level syncing.

1946
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
So, Codeman and Dark Soccer and anybody else in our free company, I'm the Garsemer.

1947
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Just feel free to ask for help because everybody can level sync down and do stuff and it's still a challenge.

1948
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:06,000
And you get, if you have like a level 48 or 49 character, you get great XP from it still.

1949
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I've actually been using the level syncing a lot for doing fates so that I can buy a stupid mount.

1950
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I'm still trying.

1951
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I had to get up to the job level so that I could buy my mount.

1952
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
You know who else has been playing Final Fantasy XIV?

1953
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Bobby Blackwolf.

1954
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Bobby.

1955
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Bobby Blackwolf finally got into it.

1956
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
He hasn't talked much about it but he's playing.

1957
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Yeah.

1958
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Good times.

1959
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Alright.

1960
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Clover Nikon says, purchase a PlayStation 4 the latter half of 2014.

1961
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
My wife and I both agree that any issues should be ironed out by them.

1962
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Good luck.

1963
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I want to get one too.

1964
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Hopefully a little sooner but we'll see.

1965
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Ragenator says, I don't really do New Year's resolutions.

1966
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
The closest thing to that is what I've been doing all along since this past March.

1967
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Buy more Steam games, preferably when they're on sale, and play more games.

1968
01:52:46,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Awesome Unicorn replied and said, my gaming resolution for 2014 is to ensure that no more of 50% of my playtime in Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII is spent recoloring and accessorizing Lightning's outfits.

1969
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
This will take all of my willpower.

1970
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I really like that answer because the extras in Final Fantasy and how far they really go, that is such an appropriate answer.

1971
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Just in any game.

1972
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I probably sat there longer creating my character in Saints Row 3 than I did actually playing that first night.

1973
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I might be ashamed to say how much time I've killed in Super Mario 64, stretching Mario's face in weird ways.

1974
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
That's part of the fun.

1975
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Osfer replies and says, I must play Final Fantasy X HD or else I will probably cry.

1976
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Also hoping that XV is released in 2014 after we've waited for so damn long.

1977
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Sj100Matt is last and says, my gaming resolution is to actually make a classic gaming setup in my place.

1978
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,000
I have the bulk of my classic gaming stuff in boxes and have to keep swapping them out when I want to play anything.

1979
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
What I would like is a full and nicely organized setup.

1980
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:57,000
It's a Retro N5? Or just Retro N? What was that thing you called?

1981
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I call it the Retron 5 just because I love Tron.

1982
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I know it's cheating, but considering what you have to do to get enough inputs for classic games like that, not to mention if you don't even have composites.

1983
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:15,000
And on top of that, a modern TV is going to have...

1984
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:26,000
The way that we did ours at the old house was that we had the switch boxes behind with these demo monitors that Dan got when GameCrazy closed.

1985
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:33,000
And with our switch boxes and the component in, we were just able to hit the box in the middle and we had everything out on one shelf.

1986
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:44,000
There's another guy who has his setup to where he used crates with LED lights at the top of each crate so that it would turn on whatever system was active.

1987
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And there's ways to do it. You have to get a little creative.

1988
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:53,000
But there are ways to organize it to where not only are your systems there ready to play, but they are also on display.

1989
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:02,000
It's a little foolish for me to jump straight to the retro end because compatibility, if nothing else...

1990
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:10,000
The HDMI, like TigerClaw says in the chatroom, Retron 5 looks interesting. The fact you can play your old games over HDMI, that right there is so appealing to me.

1991
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Just the cable space and everything. I know it's not the same thing, but close enough.

1992
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Because of my emulation history and everything else, I would have no problem with something like that.

1993
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Not to mention, I don't own those classic systems anymore. I've given a lot of them away to various friends that don't need new gaming consoles and just want to play an old fun game.

1994
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:38,000
And so I've helped them along with that. Not to mention, the only system I owned before PlayStation was an SNES. But I have neither anymore.

1995
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
You want one? I think we have three. Or four.

1996
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Well, I think all my games went with it.

1997
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
We have extras.

1998
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I am not in the mood to start scavenging and building up and paying for all those cartridges again.

1999
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
We actually are probably going to be downsizing the vault, by the way.

2000
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
You want to move with all that stuff?

2001
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Yeah. A good two-thirds of it is in storage at Dan's mom's house.

2002
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I have a quarter of a wall of a vault over there.

2003
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:15,000
One of the stacks sits at the ceiling. The stacks of components, cables, controllers. Yeah.

2004
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Amazing, though.

2005
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,000
All right. Let's see. So that was pretty much all of our answers.

2006
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:27,000
So there's nothing left to read, but still, join our Facebook community and Google Plus communities and answer future questions.

2007
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

2008
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:40,000
All right. Let's get into some more news and then we'll get into list lists and all that in just a little bit.

2009
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Loki, you want to start us off?

2010
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:52,000
So like most console games, now Battlefield 4 has been banned in China and probably has a little bit to do with the China Rising expansion.

2011
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
They say that it was banned for national security reasons.

2012
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:03,000
So I don't know. Maybe they just didn't like the view of China in that game.

2013
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Well, do you think it's one of those games where EA might want to put out like a different version to try or just know they're just going to write it off?

2014
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I think they're going to write it off.

2015
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
I kind of think so too.

2016
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Because basically the main problem with it is that they're saying that the campaign of that takes place, you know, a Chinese admiral is planning to overthrow the government.

2017
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:35,000
You know, that's something that they really want to, you know, promote or glorify there.

2018
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Very, very true.

2019
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Do games have similar scenarios with just the legit like American government?

2020
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:51,000
It's usually like, you know, you're taking out a terrorist faction that already did the deed of overthrowing the government or, you know, like future post-apocalyptic, something like that.

2021
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I'm thinking like Modern Warfare 2 and 3, that kind of stuff.

2022
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:05,000
There's always like some sort of corrupt government entity in any of these, you know, especially a lot of the military first person shooters and stuff.

2023
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Yeah. Always some kind of a nefarious, what's the word, ne'er-do-well that is the actual focal point of all of this kind of stuff.

2024
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Alright, well moving on to a game that's hopefully a little less controversial.

2025
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Dragon Quest XI. No, it hasn't been announced yet. Sit down.

2026
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Dragon Quest X, if you forgot, is an MMO game that exists on the Wii U.

2027
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I guess that's one of the games in the Dragon Quest series our friend on Facebook would not be able to play yet because I don't believe it ever came out here in America.

2028
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
It was only on Japan.

2029
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
But some people still talking about Dragon Quest XI.

2030
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Now, I guess there was some thought that Dragon Quest XI could be mobile, that it could end up being a mobile game.

2031
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:53,000
I mean, after all, Square has been putting out more and more stuff on the iPhone, iPad, iOS system and Android and so forth.

2032
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:59,000
You know, like Final Fantasy 3, 4, 5 are all there. I think 6 actually just is coming out or just came out.

2033
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I kind of stopped downloading all those because they're a little bit pricey and, you know, they're not as good as the originals.

2034
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,000
But some folks thinking that Dragon Quest XI might go that way.

2035
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:17,000
But Square Enix mobile developer Takehiro Ando would like to clarify some things in a Fumitsu column saying, quote,

2036
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:22,000
At the current stage, there are no talks about making Dragon Quest XI for smartphones.

2037
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I believe there's still plenty left to overcome before we release a proper sequel for smartphones.

2038
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:32,000
So we don't know when Dragon Quest XI will be out or what system it will be on.

2039
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I would guess PlayStation 4, but that's a huge question mark and so we'll see what happens with that.

2040
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
But it does not sound like it will be on mobile phones.

2041
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Part of this, by the way, the reason why people think Dragon Quest XI could be on mobile phones,

2042
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I guess there is a version of Dragon Quest X that is coming to mobile phones.

2043
01:59:53,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I can't imagine it nearly matches the experience of Dragon Quest X on, like, Wii U or something.

2044
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
And again, you'd be surprised how...

2045
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,000
It was originally on Wii, now that I think about it. Wii U was like a special version. It was originally on Wii.

2046
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,000
You'd be surprised how well some of this stuff can do mobily.

2047
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:15,000
There's a fair number of MOBAs and MMOs and they find ways of making it work.

2048
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:21,000
You know, input schemes that people are willing to put up with to play on their favorite franchise.

2049
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Alright, Darsakura, what do you have for us?

2050
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Chatting about classic consoles, actually.

2051
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
What a surprise.

2052
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,000
But, speaking of classics, and we did bring this up before a few weeks ago,

2053
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:37,000
but there's been an update because the BBC is now paying attention to it.

2054
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:42,000
That internet archive thing that's putting the 70s and 80s games online,

2055
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,000
the collection is including the Atari 2600, the ColecoVision,

2056
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
but the games don't yet have sound, however they will.

2057
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:57,000
And, like I said, the BBC is covering this now because the archive apparently is expanding.

2058
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
What kind of cool stuff can I play in there?

2059
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Well, the worry is that some of these are going to be illegal because they're ROMs.

2060
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
You have to have the emulator to play them.

2061
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
But the much older games are supposed to be available for legal play

2062
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:21,000
and it's not actually listing a specific type.

2063
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Okay, there we go. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Frogger are in the archives.

2064
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,000
They are also including Atari's 7800, Magnavox Odyssey,

2065
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
which in Europe was the Philips video pack G7000, and the Astrocade.

2066
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
There you go.

2067
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Yeah, it's expanded.

2068
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Alright, well, from the classics to the future, you guys,

2069
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:47,000
it's time to predict 2014 in a segment we call here at Orange Lounge Radio,

2070
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Listless!

2071
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Alright, and, of course, as the show where every gamer has a voice,

2072
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:00,000
you guys listening live play an important role in the Listless process.

2073
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:04,000
So head on over to live.vognetwork.com so you can play along with us.

2074
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Those of you listening on the podcast, I'm sorry we don't yet have the functionality for the podcast,

2075
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,000
listeners should participate too, but that is something we are working on for 2014.

2076
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,000
So listen along and have fun with us as we predict tonight's question,

2077
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:21,000
what will happen in gaming in 2014?

2078
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
What are your gaming predictions for 2014?

2079
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Now to take a walk down memory lane real quick,

2080
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
let me see if I can pull this up real quick because we actually have,

2081
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,000
I don't know if you guys know this, but there's an Orange Lounge Radio Wikipedia.

2082
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Did you guys know that? There's a Wikipedia,

2083
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
and we actually aren't even involved in it.

2084
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I mean, we're on it, obviously, because of OLR,

2085
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
but some of our awesome listeners,

2086
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
like I know Orange Wright does a lot of this,

2087
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Tetsuya does, and I know I'm leaving a ton of people out,

2088
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
but they actually, if you wonder,

2089
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
why do they keep talking about ferrets on the show?

2090
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
What is the inside joke?

2091
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
You can check that out, orangeloungeradio.wiki.com.

2092
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Midna found the ferret, by the way.

2093
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Did she?

2094
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Yes.

2095
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Well, one of the pages there on the Wikipedia is Listless,

2096
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:10,000
and it tells you every definitive list we've ever come up with here on Orange Lounge Radio

2097
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
because this is a process where we will come up with the definitive list.

2098
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:19,000
And so last year, at this time, we did 2013 predictions.

2099
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
So shall I remind you about what we predicted for 2013?

2100
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Do it.

2101
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
The number one answer was...

2102
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Oh, shoot, I just lost it. Damn it.

2103
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Sorry, guys.

2104
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
The unfortunate thing about orangeloungeradio.wiki

2105
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
is that it has some unfortunate full-screen ads that get in the way.

2106
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Here we go.

2107
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,000
No PlayStation 4 was the number one answer.

2108
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Accurate.

2109
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Oops.

2110
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Well, none of us bought it.

2111
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
No PlayStation 4 for the show. That much is very true.

2112
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,000
And then there was a three-way tie for second place.

2113
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:54,000
It was the Xbox lube is $100 with commitment.

2114
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:59,000
A Vita price drop before the first anniversary, which that did happen, right?

2115
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
That did happen.

2116
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
And then Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.

2117
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
So we were one for four.

2118
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
There we go.

2119
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Instead of the Xbox lube being $100 with commitment, it's $100 more.

2120
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
With dementia and brainwashing.

2121
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Hey, there's the voice of Alan Alchemy who's gonna be sitting in on Listless with us tonight.

2122
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Hi, Alan. How are you?

2123
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
What?

2124
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
What a good introduction there.

2125
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
All right, I had to fade the music there a little earlier

2126
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:27,000
because I don't want YouTube saying, oh, you don't own that song.

2127
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
So there we go.

2128
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
All right, getting into Listless tonight.

2129
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,000
For those of you that have never heard Listless before, it is a very scientific process.

2130
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:37,000
And there is no arguing, people, with this list.

2131
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Okay, this is the list of predictions for 2014, the official gaming community predictions.

2132
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Each host and guest participating tonight will go around and give their top three answers for what should go on the list.

2133
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Then, in a very difficult round, we will go around and each take one item off of the list,

2134
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
which then you guys, the chatters, can vote on.

2135
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
And you will vote for your number one and your number two answers.

2136
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,000
And then we will have ourselves a definitive list.

2137
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
So let's put it up on the board.

2138
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Here we go over at live.vognetwork.com.

2139
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
What are your gaming predictions for 2014?

2140
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Participating tonight with us, of course, DarkSakura, Loki, VX JasonXV, the voice of the show, myself,

2141
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
and Alan Alchemy, as you just heard there a minute ago.

2142
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Which, by the way, how are you, Alan?

2143
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
What have you been playing these days?

2144
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
What does a gaming week look like for you these days?

2145
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Lots of Final Fantasy XIV.

2146
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Yeah?

2147
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
What have you been accomplishing in that game?

2148
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I'm working on my relic.

2149
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Working on your relic?

2150
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Yeah.

2151
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
This big number has been getting bigger.

2152
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
That's right. Big numbers getting bigger.

2153
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Monsters getting bigger.

2154
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Fights getting crazier.

2155
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
All right.

2156
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
All right.

2157
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:50,000
So if you are logged in, you do have to be a logged in participant over at live.vognetwork.com.

2158
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
But, of course, we don't ask for your money. It's free.

2159
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
We don't spam you or any of that shit.

2160
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:56,000
So check that out over at vognetwork.com.

2161
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:02,000
And you guys in the chat can shout out your answers because we may use some of them here on the show,

2162
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,000
especially as answers get stolen because sometimes there's duplicate answers and so forth.

2163
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
So as we did before, ladies first.

2164
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:14,000
DarkSakura, what is your number three pick for gaming prediction for 2014?

2165
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Serious or silly? Whatever you want.

2166
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
World of Warcraft loses over a million subscribers over the course of 2014.

2167
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,000
So WoW loses a million more.

2168
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Over.

2169
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
A minimum of a million subscribers over the course of 2014.

2170
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Okay. And why do you say that?

2171
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Because it's shit.

2172
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
No.

2173
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Come on. Don't hate on WoW. There's still a lot of friends I have that play.

2174
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
I still like WoW.

2175
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I just don't think that the new expansion, even with as much as it kind of had me excited, I don't think it's enough to save it.

2176
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
It's too little, too late. They're just throwing bones now.

2177
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,000
And, yeah, they may get a few lore nerds back and happy.

2178
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
And I'm a lore nerd.

2179
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:58,000
How many of those books are on my shelves, you know?

2180
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:04,000
And I would probably, you know, play for a week to see the content and then quit again.

2181
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,000
So it's just not enough for me.

2182
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
All right. So there it is up on the board.

2183
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
WoW loses one million subs over the year.

2184
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
All right. Let's go to Loki with your number three answer.

2185
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Loki, your 2014 prediction. What will happen in 2014, Loki, per your crystal ball?

2186
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I would say after Mario Kart 8 fails to sell enough consoles for Nintendo, and I'm talking about the Wii, of course, that they will finally drop the price.

2187
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Stolen one already.

2188
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
You were thinking the same thing?

2189
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Oh, absolutely.

2190
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,000
You guys, maybe not for that reason, but a price drop is going to happen just because.

2191
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
You guys are in, like, super pessimist.

2192
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Oh, OK. So you think a price drop is inevitable for the Wii?

2193
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
I think Mario Kart 8 is going to do fucking fantastic, but I think a price drop is going to happen.

2194
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Yeah, that's my thing too. I also think Mario Kart 8 is going to do really well.

2195
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:58,000
But why do you think it's going to fail? You just think it's going to fail because there's not going to be the Wii U's out there or whatever?

2196
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I think it's just, it can still be a good game, but it's just not going to be enough for people to buy the console for.

2197
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I mean, some people might, but it's just not going to be enough to make a huge enough difference to where, you know, all of a sudden it's going to be a 3DS.

2198
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Well, it's a good thing we have an elimination round.

2199
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:20,000
The question is, am I being meaner by saying that it's going to drop anyways as compared to Loki?

2200
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:26,000
No, because I do think it will drop in price. I mean, all the consoles will drop in price next holiday. They all will.

2201
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
And the Wii U will be two years old next year.

2202
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Yeah, so, but we'll see. So there it is. I'm going to put it on the board anyway. Mario Kart 8 fails. Wii U price dropped.

2203
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Jason, I know you just said he jacked one of your answers, but I got to pick on you now. Number 3, what's your number 3 answer?

2204
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Half Life 3 question mark, smiley face, frowny face won't get released.

2205
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Half Life 3 question mark, smiley face won't get released.

2206
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Won't get released, which is kind of vague because that allows for an announcement.

2207
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Or do you think 2014 is going to be a complete information void toilet for Half Life 3 still?

2208
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
I mean, it already has been.

2209
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Hasn't it always been?

2210
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:16,000
I don't expect it to change, but I'm going to stick squarely with no Half Life 3.

2211
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Okay, so there it is up on the board. Half Life 3 won't get released up on the board next to duh and of course.

2212
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Alright, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. Alright, my number 3 answer, I'll go next with my number 3 answer.

2213
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:37,000
My number 3 answer, and I know I'm going to have like two of you guys going, God damn it, that's what I picked.

2214
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:43,000
My number 3 answer is Ouya Goes Under. Ouya calls it a day.

2215
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I just, I think it's...

2216
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
You went there?

2217
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:52,000
I went there, I'm sorry, but it's just one of those things that had a huge fanfare and now it's kind of went pfft.

2218
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,000
And you know, I realize they're doing great things for indies and all that, but I just...

2219
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
But Ouya 2, Rob, Ouya 2.

2220
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Yeah, Ouya 2 soon, so...

2221
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I'm sticking to it. Take it off if you don't agree. Ouya Goes Under. And so I'm going to put that up on the board.

2222
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
These are some really real talk topics happening here.

2223
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:18,000
This is a gamershateeverything.com edition. Come on, guys. Cheer it up a little bit.

2224
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Happy faces. Talk about what you do like.

2225
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Alright, they're going to lose a million subs and then they're going to fail and you're still not going to get your damn game and then the company's going to go under.

2226
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Alright, Alan, maybe you have a cheerful number 3 answer or maybe you don't, but what is your number 3 answer?

2227
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Actually, you pointing that out made me think of something really dark and grim that I wasn't going to say previously.

2228
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
So, whether or not I say it is...

2229
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it. Who wants Alan to go there?

2230
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Go there, go there, go there.

2231
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:52,000
One of the big Nintendo godfathers of gaming will pass away.

2232
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Stop, that is too soon. No, you can't say that.

2233
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Yes, he can.

2234
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:03,000
The Zelda Mario dude, one of them. The Final Fantasy, one of the big 8-bit godfathers.

2235
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
You are awful and you should feel awful.

2236
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,000
They're all like pushing 70, right?

2237
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
That's not very old anymore.

2238
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Well, it's true, but people fall downstairs every day.

2239
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
At least, let's hope that none of them get hit by a car like what's-his-face.

2240
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
This is supposed to be a funny segment, you guys.

2241
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I wouldn't have thought of it if you didn't point it out.

2242
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I'm going to need...

2243
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Sarah!

2244
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I need everybody to eliminate number three answers.

2245
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Wouldn't falling downstairs be kind of ironic in the whole Paul Walker ironic?

2246
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Because, you know, they do have to climb stairs at the very end of each Mario level to jump on the goalpost.

2247
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:43,000
No, it would be ironic if he gets kidnapped by a monkey and taken to the top of a skyrise.

2248
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
That would be ironic.

2249
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Alright.

2250
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
So I'm going to need us all to...

2251
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Let's try to make it a little bit happier.

2252
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Go on to number two and then we'll just eliminate all the threes.

2253
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Alright.

2254
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Alright, let's try again.

2255
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Your number two...

2256
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:04,000
So far, since I have to read it anyway, the super dark 2014 gaming crash number two predictions list.

2257
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Wow! loses a million subs over the year.

2258
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Mario Kart 8 fails. Wii U price drop.

2259
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Half-Life 3 won't get released.

2260
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Ouya goes under and 8-bit godfather passes.

2261
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Alright.

2262
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Let's go on to the number two happy shiny answers.

2263
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Dark Sakura.

2264
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Dark Sakura.

2265
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Stop influencing me.

2266
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Alright.

2267
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Dark Sakura.

2268
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
What is your number two answer?

2269
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,000
There will be another huge shipping war on Tumblr based on screenshots for the next Mass Effect.

2270
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:35,000
When people are shipping background characters, there will be shipping on screencaps.

2271
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
And remind us if you do not know what shipping means.

2272
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Relationships.

2273
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,000
People fucking.

2274
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Those are two very different things, actually.

2275
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
It's fan-driven.

2276
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Okay, there is a big annoyance I have with just, oh, these two characters are friends.

2277
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
They're fucking.

2278
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
No, they might not be fucking.

2279
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
But anyway.

2280
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:59,000
But no, it's basically the shipping is going to happen based on screencaptures.

2281
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
People are going to make assumptions.

2282
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Tumblr is going to piss themselves and ship all the things.

2283
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
So Dark Sakura is number two answer.

2284
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
The internet will exist is up on the board.

2285
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
No, no, no.

2286
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Rule 34 will continue.

2287
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Mass Effect 4 will be shipped before it ships.

2288
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

2289
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I guess I should really change that to say new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

2290
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
We'll change that answer a little bit there and alter that on the board.

2291
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Alright, Loki, dare I ask, your number two answer.

2292
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Hey, I actually don't have a negative one this time.

2293
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I was going to say Left for Dead 3 and Source 2 will be out next year.

2294
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
There it is.

2295
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Left for Dead 3 and Source 2 makes its way out next year.

2296
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Seems logical.

2297
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Why not?

2298
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:53,000
It's going to be really weird when like L4D4, Left for Dead 4 comes out just because numbers.

2299
02:13:53,000 --> 02:14:02,000
The thought was because when they announced Portal 2, they made Portal 1 free to download temporarily.

2300
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Same with Left for Dead 2 just happened where they made it free for a day just to build up the game.

2301
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Just to build up the user base of it.

2302
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,000
So, most likely an announcement will be coming soon for that.

2303
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I've theorized previously that Left for Dead 3 and Source 2 running for a year will be the testing,

2304
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:28,000
putting the toe in the water that Valve needs to make any sort of announcement on Half-Life 3.

2305
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Nope.

2306
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Announcement?

2307
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Alright.

2308
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
We did have that conversation.

2309
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
But that's not even an entry.

2310
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
That's just...

2311
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
No, that's fine.

2312
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
That's fine.

2313
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Besides, it's not your turn.

2314
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Jason, what is your number 2 answer?

2315
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,000
I'm personally ready for L4D20.

2316
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Sorry.

2317
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Anyways.

2318
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Oculus Rift released, 4K resolution.

2319
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:57,000
As opposed to their current expectation, which is 128800?

2320
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I was going to say, we know Oculus Rift is coming, but you say Oculus Rift is going to blow something away with resolution and quality and not just current expectations.

2321
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
It is real fucking life, y'all.

2322
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Pretty much.

2323
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Oculus Rift.

2324
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Real fucking life.

2325
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Alright.

2326
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Fair enough.

2327
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
There it is.

2328
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Up on the board.

2329
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Alright.

2330
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:20,000
That is so funny that you bring up the Oculus Rift, and it is really funny because also in chat, we had SSJ100Matt says,

2331
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
One of the big three will announce an Oculus Rift type of device.

2332
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Well, funny enough, I swear I have this written before the show tonight, but my number 2 answer?

2333
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Microsoft jacks the Rift.

2334
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,000
What does Microsoft love to do?

2335
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:38,000
They are going to take an idea that's popular in gaming and improve on it best they can.

2336
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I fully expect Microsoft to jack the Rift.

2337
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I'm not sure improve is the case either.

2338
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Why not buy Oculus Rift?

2339
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Because for Microsoft to fit that MO perfectly, they usually absorb the technology that they're going to remove.

2340
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Oh, they better not sell.

2341
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
That would be horrendous.

2342
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Since it is a dark edition of Listless tonight, I'm going to go to a darker place and say Microsoft's just going to flat up steal it.

2343
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I mean, they'll do something, you know, obviously there's trademarks and they can't just steal it.

2344
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:10,000
So, they'll put their own spin on it, but I'm going to say it's, I peg Microsoft does it, and they're going to, it'll be part of the one.

2345
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:16,000
So, it'll be the, not the Rift, but the, you know, the Shift.

2346
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
I don't know.

2347
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,000
I got nothing.

2348
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:22,000
But Microsoft jacks the Rift is my number 2 answer, and I'm putting it up on the board.

2349
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Alright.

2350
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Alan Alchemy, last but not least, with your number 2 answer.

2351
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Nintendo finally brings DS, not 3DS, but DS ROMs to a store on the Wii U, and somehow they make it disappointing.

2352
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I love how you had to tack on the, and it's disappointing, just to keep it dark.

2353
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Whether it be the price or the games that they actually announce for it or how it plays, they'll do it and it'll somehow still be stupid.

2354
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Alright.

2355
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Again, another dark answer tonight.

2356
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints.

2357
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Womp womp.

2358
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Alright, there it is, your number 2 answer.

2359
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Alright, let's run through the board real quick.

2360
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:15,000
We have new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war, WoW loses a million subs over the year, Left 4 Dead 3 in Source 2 is out, Mario Kart 8 fails and the Wii U price is dropped,

2361
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Oculus Rift released in 4K resolution, Half Life 3 won't get released, Microsoft jacks the Rift,

2362
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Ouya goes under, Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints, 8-bit Godfather passes.

2363
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Alright, now it is time for the number 1 answer, the thing you most predict for 2014.

2364
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
DarkSakura, what is your number 1 prediction?

2365
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:43,000
I've actually been drawing a blank the entire time.

2366
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:52,000
I mean, so I am going to say that an innovation within the video game industry leads to new advances for people with disabilities.

2367
02:17:52,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Like maybe Vision for the Blind, they're already working on bionic ocular implants, those are a legit thing now.

2368
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Maybe they're working on bionic oculus rift plans.

2369
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:16,000
I need to knock this shit off real fast, I'm sorry.

2370
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:21,000
So an unknown innovation in the video game industry leads to advances for the disabled, I had to shorten that a little bit.

2371
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:28,000
We're already seeing it happen, so I think that something really big is going to happen that's going to turn around a lot of the negative press.

2372
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Let's hope. Loki, did you have something to add to that?

2373
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Oh, I was just telling Jason to stop it.

2374
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Alright, well shut them up with your number 1 answer, Loki. What is the number 1 prediction for 2014?

2375
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I've only been saying this the entire year, but I'm hoping that they'll do this because they'll definitely beef up what they have available for the system.

2376
02:18:53,000 --> 02:19:03,000
3DS games on the Wii U, using the gamepad as the bottom screen, TV as the top screen.

2377
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:10,000
So you're going to just one-up what Alan said and say 3DS games on the Wii U.

2378
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Well, I've been seeing it all year long. It's an inevitability.

2379
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Fair enough. You can put what you want. There it is, Loki's up on the board with 3DS games on the Wii U.

2380
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,000
He did leave out the point, though, that it disappoints, for what it's worth.

2381
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Alright, so there it is, Loki's number 1 answer. Jason, we're over to you. What is your number 1 prediction?

2382
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Jesus. Let's go with...

2383
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Indie game released to such fanfare, they get signed on to a major publisher for a AAA release.

2384
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:53,000
The release doesn't have to happen, but the groundswell and fanfare has to happen in 2014.

2385
02:19:53,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Indie game signed on to produce AAA port of the same game.

2386
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:07,000
I'm going to try to shorten that to say indie goes from indie to AAA in the scope of a year.

2387
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
That works. Makes sense.

2388
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:15,000
I'm going to say indie game and put that on the board. Any idea what that type of game could be?

2389
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
A good one.

2390
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
If you knew it, you'd be a millionaire.

2391
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Alright, you'd be a millionaire.

2392
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Bochikawa says, so like what happened with Portal? Something like that, right?

2393
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Well, yeah, that actually was kind of it because it was that Narbacular drop.

2394
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Alright, my number 1 answer. Here it is, it's a long one. I don't know how I'm going to shorten this for the board, but here it is.

2395
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:47,000
My number 1 answer. In 2014, the year of Captain Falcon, F-Zero U is announced.

2396
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:51,000
It's the greatest game ever made and we, you haters, can shove it.

2397
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Falcon Punch.

2398
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
That is my number 1 answer. Falcon Punch.

2399
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
F-Zero Boner Party.

2400
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
That's how you condense that down.

2401
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Okay. That works. Nintendo's year of Captain Falcon.

2402
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
That's what they're going to call it. F-Zero Boner Party.

2403
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Nintendo's year of Falcon Punch.

2404
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Nintendo's year of Falcon Boner.

2405
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I will accept that shortening. Nintendo's year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

2406
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Fair enough. I like it. It is up on the board as my number 1 answer.

2407
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Alright, that means we are down to one more prediction to go up on the board.

2408
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Just before we hear Alan's answer, some of the things we see in chat.

2409
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Tech 2030 says Nintendo comes out with a 3DS player peripheral for the Wii U.

2410
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:43,000
5th Dream says a Final Fantasy XIV expansion. Game Guru says 2014, the year we predict disappointments in gaming.

2411
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Tiger Claw says in 2014, Gabe Newell will announce the release date for the Half-Life movie.

2412
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Degenerate Johnny says Nintendo pulls a Disney and starts buying up purchasable third party LPs.

2413
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Yeah, IPs maybe.

2414
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
I think he was saying Let's Plays.

2415
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Oh, I got it.

2416
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Degenerate Johnny says Hearthstone will remain in beta throughout the whole year.

2417
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Womp, womp, womp.

2418
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I like the SSJ100 nets. I'm going to get thrown out next year.

2419
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
You already got thrown out last week.

2420
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
That's exactly what I said.

2421
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
But it can happen again in 2014.

2422
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Alan, there is one spot left on the list. What do you put in there as your number 1 prediction?

2423
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Bethesda confirms and gives an ETA for either the next campaign Elder Scrolls game or Fallout 4.

2424
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,000
That's too wide of a net. Which one?

2425
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Fallout 4. We've been waiting longer for that.

2426
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
So Bethesda confirms Fallout 4.

2427
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
And gives an ETA.

2428
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
And gives an ETA.

2429
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Wasn't there an article about that in the last week or two?

2430
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Sounds awfully familiar for some reason.

2431
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Yeah, it's going to be probably out in October.

2432
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Oh yeah, I'm sure that's a good one. I think that's an E3 given. Absolutely.

2433
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Alright, that's alright.

2434
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:58,000
So here it is. Here it is, you guys. Here's what the board says right now.

2435
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

2436
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
New Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

2437
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
WoW loses 1 million subs over the year.

2438
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
3DS games on the Wii U.

2439
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.

2440
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Mario Kart 8 fails and Wii U prices dropped.

2441
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Indie game goes from Indie to Triple A in the scope of a year.

2442
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Oculus Rift released with a 4K resolution.

2443
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Half Life 3 won't get released.

2444
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

2445
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Microsoft jacks the Rift.

2446
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Ouya goes under. Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives ETA.

2447
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints.

2448
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
And 8-bit Godfather passes.

2449
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I got a name from Microsoft's Rift.

2450
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
What? The Jacked.

2451
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Be quiet. Alright.

2452
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
I thought that was a really good name.

2453
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Because you're jacked into the game.

2454
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:48,000
But you know, that is so opening it up to

2455
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I'm going to get jacked on my X-bone, you guys.

2456
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Yeah, I'm jacking my X-bone.

2457
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Duh. Duh.

2458
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Alright. Thanks for leading me to the joke that I was already at.

2459
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Here we go. A lot of these answers coming off the list tonight.

2460
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Because there's five of us. But that's the way it works.

2461
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Remember, we have a new rule for 2013 that will carry on into next year.

2462
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,000
When a host loses two answers, their remaining answer gets immunity.

2463
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
So think before you eliminate.

2464
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:16,000
So Dark Sakura, you get to eliminate any one of these you want off the board.

2465
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2466
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I'm not going to say it's not worthy of the list.

2467
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
But I just want to be a little bit less morbid.

2468
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,000
And I'm sorry, Alan, but I'm going to take off the 8-fit godfather.

2469
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
So nobody else has to.

2470
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I kind of thought that was going to go.

2471
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
To be fair...

2472
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Even though it's probably going to happen.

2473
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
We brought it on ourselves.

2474
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
He said it was going to be dark.

2475
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
And we made him do it.

2476
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I honestly think it's going to happen.

2477
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
So I'm going to take it off.

2478
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Well, it is stricken from the list.

2479
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
So we don't have to talk about it anymore.

2480
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Lee, you're up next.

2481
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I don't know if you can see the board there over at live.vognetwork.com.

2482
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
But which of these is not worthy of the list?

2483
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Only because it doesn't really make any sense to me.

2484
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
It just seems very uninteresting.

2485
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
New Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.

2486
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Oh, new Mass Effect.

2487
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Well, to be fair, of course that's going to happen.

2488
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
She's not wrong.

2489
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I know I'm not wrong.

2490
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
That's a guarantee.

2491
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
It's too safe a prediction.

2492
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
And we're too edgy here at OLR for that.

2493
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
So it is stricken from the list.

2494
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
All right, fair enough.

2495
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Jason, it's a tough job, but that's what we do here at OLR.

2496
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

2497
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Oculus only has one C, by the way.

2498
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
That's okay.

2499
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Will you strike something from the list?

2500
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,000
You want me to strike that C?

2501
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I'm striking a letter from the list.

2502
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
You're striking a letter.

2503
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
All right, it has been stricken from the list.

2504
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Oh, my goodness.

2505
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
That letter has been stricken from the list.

2506
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Shit, there are two very, very good ones.

2507
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,000
And which one do I think is less likely of the two?

2508
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:51,000
I'm going to toss out 3DS games on the Wii U.

2509
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Oh, 3DS games on the Wii U.

2510
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,000
You're going to stick with Alan's more morbid prediction

2511
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:00,000
that it's just the regular DS and it disappoints.

2512
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I don't think either one of them has the 3DS plays DS titles,

2513
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:09,000
but definitely not 3DS games on the Wii U, unfortunately.

2514
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
I would love it. Ain't going to happen.

2515
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
All right, so it is stricken from the list.

2516
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Loki loses 3DS games on the Wii U.

2517
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Gone's gone.

2518
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,000
All right, my turn.

2519
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
I get to take something off the list.

2520
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I am going to remove from the list.

2521
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Sorry, Loki, but I'm coming for you.

2522
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,000
You knew I was going to take this one off.

2523
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I'm taking off Mario Kart 8 fails and the Wii U price drop.

2524
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I think, again, just like the Mass Effect thing,

2525
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:34,000
that's too safe of a prediction.

2526
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Of course, the Wii U price is going to drop,

2527
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
and I don't think Mario Kart 8 will fail.

2528
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,000
I think it'll be the second-based game on the console next to Mario 3D World.

2529
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
So sorry, Loki, but it is stricken from the list.

2530
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:47,000
But that does mean Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 coming out,

2531
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:50,000
that gets immunity, and Alan may not remove it from the list.

2532
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:54,000
So, Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2533
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Like a panicked engineer with a crowbar in his hand,

2534
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Half-Life 3 won't get released.

2535
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
It's gone.

2536
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
You are not allowing that to happen.

2537
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
All right, fair enough.

2538
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Sorry, Jason, but again, too safe, Jason.

2539
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Good point.

2540
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,000
All right, it is stricken from the list.

2541
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
So there it is, guys.

2542
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,000
That was a very tough process.

2543
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
It was like pulling teeth, but here we go.

2544
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
The answers you have left to vote for.

2545
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.

2546
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
WoW loses a million subs over the year.

2547
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.

2548
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Indie game goes from indie to AAA in the scope of a year.

2549
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Oculus Rift released at 4K resolution.

2550
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

2551
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Microsoft jacks the Rift.

2552
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Ouya goes under.

2553
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA.

2554
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints.

2555
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Those are some hefty choices, you guys, but you can vote now.

2556
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Now, some of you might be thinking, oh, all of those are going to come true.

2557
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Well, you're going to click on your number 1 and your number 2.

2558
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Remember, the first one you click is your number 1,

2559
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
and the second one you click is your number 2.

2560
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Those are the ones you like the best of those answers that are up on the board.

2561
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:05,000
So have at it.

2562
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
It is now live, and you can vote for the next few minutes.

2563
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
They're at live.vognetwork.com.

2564
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
It is a live poll, and you may now vote.

2565
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:17,000
And we will tally up those answers and read the answers here in just a little bit.

2566
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:21,000
All right. Good times. Good times.

2567
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
A little morbid, but that's all right.

2568
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:26,000
I think we cleaned up the list pretty good there at the end, so it's a little less morbid.

2569
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:30,000
We've got a few more stories for you guys, though, before we get to the answers

2570
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
and the FUs of the week and all that good stuff.

2571
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

2572
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Thank you, Alan, by the way, for participating.

2573
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
We'll let you know if one of yours wins.

2574
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Okay.

2575
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Just in case you wanted to check it out, there's another Telltale series that's free to try.

2576
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:50,000
At least they have the first episode for free right now, The Wolf Among Us.

2577
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:54,000
And you can get that free on Xbox Live Arcade.

2578
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,000
And I'm not sure how long it's supposed to be free for, so better act fast.

2579
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:00,000
And they're also doing discounts for some other stuff for the end of the year.

2580
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:06,000
They've been marking down stuff, I think, all the way up through New Year's, so go check it out.

2581
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
I've heard a lot of really good things about this game.

2582
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:14,000
This is another one of those, I should have played it in 2013, but oops, I didn't.

2583
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
So, yes, I'm very curious to check this out.

2584
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Wait, wait, before you run away, Alan, don't you read?

2585
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
You read a lot of these graphic novels and stuff.

2586
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Are you familiar with the fables that the Telltale ones based off of?

2587
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I have the first three volumes in The Office, so yeah.

2588
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Are you going to check this out? Are you curious about this game?

2589
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
It depends on what spoilers it has for the comics,

2590
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:39,000
because I'm only on volume 3 of the trade paperback, and they're on, what, volume 30.

2591
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:42,000
So I checked it out four years ago and haven't touched it since.

2592
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Uh-oh. All right.

2593
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
They can still mark it for download, you know, just in case.

2594
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:52,000
All right, well, you know, as most Telltale games, if you wait a little longer,

2595
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,000
it'll probably be like five bucks for the whole thing at some point.

2596
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:58,000
But at the same time, I've been hearing great things about it,

2597
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
so I don't know how much longer we can wait.

2598
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
So we'll check that out soon.

2599
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
All right, Jason, what do you got for us?

2600
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:12,000
A couple months ago, the Mighty No. 9 gang held a vote to determine the design of Beck's Helper Call.

2601
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Those votes have been counted, and design number F.

2602
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Take a bow. Take a virtual radio bow for everybody but the YouTube listeners,

2603
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
because I can drive that point home.

2604
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Um, design F only won by less than 3%.

2605
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Design H came in third, and design E was the close rejection.

2606
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:38,000
I really want to see what, uh, should be able to go see the vote and see what design E is,

2607
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
because I really, really dig design F.

2608
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Very, very, you know, golden blonde hair, predominantly red, kind of lollipop striping.

2609
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Very appropriate, but really, really a good design.

2610
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Let's see, design F, that's E, this'll probably take me a minute.

2611
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:04,000
So we finally have the primary two protagonists in Mighty No. 9, Beck and Call,

2612
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:08,000
and what each of them look like, their relevant primary color scheme, and so forth.

2613
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Uh, she kind of looks like one of those cinnamon candy canes to me with the pink and red striping.

2614
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I mean, I know this is a radio show, so I can't really, like, show you the pictures,

2615
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,000
but just imagine, like, you know, the whole, like, Mega Man style,

2616
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:22,000
which obviously they're changing just ever so slightly for this Mighty No. 9,

2617
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:25,000
but she's more of, like, one of those cinnamon candy canes with big blonde hair.

2618
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:28,000
I think E was pretty good, too, taking a look at that.

2619
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,000
They have the, um, designs, if you go to the second page of the Kickstarter,

2620
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,000
there's a link on the article there. It shows the different designs.

2621
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:39,000
But I like the, I like, it looks like she's gonna get something with her ears,

2622
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
like, she got, like, helicopter ears or something, so that's, that'll be cute.

2623
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Those are, uh, oh, jeez, what are those called?

2624
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Um, they're, they're basically, like, hair...

2625
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I wanna say a hair tie, but that's completely incorrect.

2626
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Pigtails, you mean?

2627
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:57,000
It's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a hair tie in a bow, basically, is what's going on there.

2628
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Uh, and suddenly my chat is not working anymore, so I can't paste this in, uh, in chat.

2629
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
No, they got it, and Pochi, Pochi Kawa put it in there, too, so.

2630
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,000
It completely stopped updating for me, so I can't even see it.

2631
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Um, because tonight is my night of puns,

2632
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:16,000
should I read the, uh, the pun-tastic quote at the bottom of this article?

2633
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Sure.

2634
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Some of you may have just met Design F, and think it's crazy,

2635
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:24,000
but she's got the numbers, so she's calm now, baby.

2636
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
That is definitely gonna do it for the news for 2013.

2637
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Um, that is the last news article we are reading, uh, this year.

2638
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,000
No Mighty No. 9 in our 2014 predictions, but I am very much looking forward to it.

2639
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Oh, that's cause it'll happen, it'll be amazing.

2640
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
That would've been a very safe prediction.

2641
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Well, it's, they said it's gonna come out in 2014 when the Kickstarter whole thing happened.

2642
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Uh, I think, was it supposed to be 2015?

2643
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Ah, it was 2014. Uh-oh.

2644
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Maybe Mighty No. 9 getting delayed would've been a good guess, alright.

2645
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Number, uh, Style E is like, it's like a cross between Officer Jenny and, um...

2646
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Yeah, a little bit.

2647
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Oh, what other character am I thinking of? I can't even, I can't even think of a name or a universe to put it to.

2648
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:13,000
They're all cute. Uh, look at, look at the Kickstarter page, look at the vote, these are, these are fantastic designs.

2649
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I'm really looking forward to this game.

2650
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Yeah, um, according to the Kickstarter page, the digital copy, the estimated delivery is April 2015.

2651
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Oh, wow.

2652
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Alright, well, uh, it is about that time, we're almost to the part of the show where we're gonna take calls,

2653
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,000
but first, we wanna hear from our listeners in a segment we call The Mailbag.

2654
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Every week, you guys email us mailbag at orangelaundry.com,

2655
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:41,000
and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and finds a few emails that she thinks,

2656
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:44,000
oh, this, this is worth looking at. Let's talk about this tonight.

2657
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,000
I like Dee best.

2658
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Oh, you're looking at the...

2659
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Yeah, I think I really like Dee best.

2660
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Why is that?

2661
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Dee is like gothic, goth Lolita kinda, something like that.

2662
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Exactly, exactly. She's kinda dark and badass.

2663
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:01,000
And I like B2 because it sorta gives me that Dr. Slump vibe.

2664
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Mailbag.

2665
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Alright, I know you're reading a lot of letters, but there's some letters in our mailbag as well.

2666
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:10,000
And you're complaining about me tonight! Wow!

2667
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Wow!

2668
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Jamie?

2669
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Just a thought such as it is, I presume the YouTube content ID issue won't come to a head

2670
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:28,000
when a major partner channel such as Tabuscus and Epic Mealtime and Vsauce gets taken down for content claims.

2671
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Rather, it will happen when Disney, say, issues a claim or has a claim issued on their behalf

2672
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:37,000
against content from one of Viacom's own channels or vice versa.

2673
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Also, I'm disappointed that the Mac version of the Stanley Parable requires 10.8.

2674
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:47,000
I'm hesitant to upgrade my OS on my 2009 laptop to even 10.7.

2675
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Much less seriously and too wordy, from what I understand, of the plot of Assassin's Creed 4.

2676
02:34:53,000 --> 02:35:02,000
I'd like to see them have taken as much historic liberties with their Chanties as with the music of Bioshock Infinity.

2677
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Ideally take inspiration from Dinosaur Comics and sing pop songs with babies substituted with Matey.

2678
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Everyone's trying to be me Matey, Matey I love your way, Matey done a bad bad thing and so on.

2679
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
That comes from Robert M.

2680
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
And that's the YouTube thing.

2681
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
I'm full of it tonight.

2682
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Epic Mealtime is never going to have a content ID against them because all of their stuff is 100% original.

2683
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Here's something else to consider. As much as that's how we all want to see it go down,

2684
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,000
you all know YouTube has a secret whitelist that nobody talks about.

2685
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
The people that are on the whitelist aren't talking about it.

2686
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:38,000
But that's why Viacom's not going to have a copyright claim against them ever. They're on the whitelist.

2687
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:43,000
That's what some of the outrage was is because some of these people that we would have presumed were on it,

2688
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:47,000
affiliates, notably, were starting to get screwed by this.

2689
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:53,000
I think Epic Mealtime, Epic Mealtime primary channel will not, but their spinoff Original Gamer,

2690
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:57,000
assuming that's even still a thing, I actually haven't watched it in quite a couple of weeks now.

2691
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Original Gamer stands the biggest threat because of their non-original content, non-original video.

2692
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:11,000
But it remains to be seen what changes do and don't happen as a result of the last couple of weeks of fallout.

2693
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Next email?

2694
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Yes.

2695
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2696
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Was there a name on that last email?

2697
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,000
That was Robert M.

2698
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Oh, I missed that somehow.

2699
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I wanted to share a quick story. I just finished rebuilding my DDR pad for this winter and have been jamming about four times a week.

2700
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:33,000
My legs have never hurt so bad and I'm a hardcore road cyclist. It's a different kind of impact.

2701
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Anyway, last night I finished on a heavy nine-step that is lightning steps for half the song.

2702
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:43,000
My legs were jello, so I walked downstairs and completely pulled my left quad.

2703
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Now I can barely walk. When people ask what happened, I get a hazy look in my eye and tell them that I pulled a muscle dance into a video game.

2704
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:56,000
You know their typical response? They smile politely and walk away. They don't know what to say. How awkward.

2705
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
I don't know what to tell you.

2706
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:05,000
I'm going to give you a little bit of advice a trainer gave me, but by no means am I a trainer slash doctor, whatever.

2707
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:13,000
When you are done playing DDR, don't walk downstairs, don't walk upstairs, don't do anything more strenuous.

2708
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Walk slowly and stretch. Stretch while your muscles are warm and usually you'll avoid cramps.

2709
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:23,000
That's just my experience, but again, I'm not a professional.

2710
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:27,000
I think it's a generally accepted thing out there too. Make sure you always stretch before you play.

2711
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:30,000
No, no, no. Don't stretch before you play. Stretch after you warm up.

2712
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:35,000
If you stretch a muscle when it has not warmed up, you can do more damage to it.

2713
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Okay. Fair enough. I can see that because they do say you should walk a little bit before you do like stretching.

2714
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Well, here's an example. When I go to the gym, I spend five minutes on a bike or recumbent bike or the treadmill.

2715
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Then I do 10 minutes of yoga. Then I lift my weights. So just saying.

2716
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:55,000
But always stretch after you've done doing anything strenuous because then that'll prevent cramps.

2717
02:37:55,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Am I getting old or am I just overdoing it? As a 34-year-old, this is my main form of exercise during the non-cycling months.

2718
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:07,000
I'm sure you guys have had DDR injuries, right? Right? Well, actually, you remember the issue?

2719
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
It's been a long time, but yeah.

2720
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
I did fall and hit my head on the machine once.

2721
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:19,000
But you remember those shoes that I had that I couldn't do jumping moves because the arch support in my shoes were sending pain.

2722
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:32,000
It sent pain up my feet. And so I would come off of the machine with shooting pain going up both of my legs coming directly from my arches because I already have pretty hefty arches in my feet.

2723
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:37,000
I don't have flat feet. I have the opposite problem. I have really high arches in my feet.

2724
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:49,000
And when I changed from using arch support shoes to using either flats like Converse, All Stars, or the Airwalk equivalent and my Vibrams, that all went away.

2725
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:54,000
So that was my biggest injury with DDR.

2726
02:38:54,000 --> 02:39:03,000
But I can tell you that I had pulled, actually torn a tendon in my foot in high school, not high school, in college in Alabama.

2727
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:11,000
And I had been in just a loose brace for the next few years after that, but playing DDR healed it because I made my foot stronger.

2728
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:15,000
To continue with email? You guys didn't have any other contribution?

2729
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:16,000
No.

2730
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I did hit my head on the DDR machine once.

2731
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Because I don't want to make the guy hurt himself worse.

2732
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:26,000
I haven't played serious DDR in a very long time, sadly. It is what it is.

2733
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:36,000
There's a few people in chatroom, by the way. I def said I twisted my ankle playing DDR twice. Once on a cobalt flux pad. It was rather painful.

2734
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
So to continue this email, it's almost done.

2735
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Loki, I got Surgeon Simulator on Steam sale today. Good grief, it's impossible, but hilarious.

2736
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Your loyal turtle in Philly. Serious turtle.

2737
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:52,000
It's a fun game. And yes, it is impossible.

2738
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
The space one is hilarious.

2739
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Okay, so last email.

2740
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Hey OLR crew, AZHP here. You get the last email of the year.

2741
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Bum bum, you win.

2742
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Air. Take a deep breath.

2743
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Just wanted to chime in with a few thoughts I had on PAX's diversity lounge idea.

2744
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:20,000
I feel like that by labeling a room as a place to learn about diversity in gaming culture, it's making it seem like it will be the only room where PAX minorities can feel safe and at ease.

2745
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:26,000
It's a hard sell to make a room shoved into a corner feel like you're being, quote, inclusive to people.

2746
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:35,000
I also wanted to bring your guys' attention to the awesome games done quick charity marathon, which you guys mentioned last year on your show.

2747
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:41,000
You guys talked about it after the marathon was over, so I wanted to make sure all the listeners knew about the marathon before it starts.

2748
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:51,000
It runs from Sunday, January 5th through the 11th and will feature some of the best speed gamers from around the world, playing games fast to raise money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

2749
02:40:51,000 --> 02:41:00,000
I got really into speed running after watching last year's marathon and started learning tricks for some classic games like Super Mario 64, that would be the wall jump, and Ocarina of Time.

2750
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Learning each new trick helps drive your time down and it's kind of addicting.

2751
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Side note, my best times on the games are 22 minutes for Super Mario 64 and 25 minutes for Ocarina of Time.

2752
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:28,000
There are bidding wars and prize raffles throughout the marathon as well, so if you want to donate money to a good cause, have the chance to win prizes, and watch people completely wreck games that you love in ways you never thought possible, make sure to watch and just search awesome games done quick and it will be the first link.

2753
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Thanks for reading my email, hope you all had a happy holiday and have a happy new year, AZHP.

2754
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Thank you for reminding me of the charity event, I know Flaco Jones is a big fan of this too, it's an ex-feral and a horde house, watches a lot of this too.

2755
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:50,000
So yeah, these guys are very popular and it's for good reason, and yeah, that speedrun stuff can be addicting. I'm terrible at it, but it's sort of fun to think about it.

2756
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Those people are just like, the level of detail that they understand a game's engine is phenomenal to me.

2757
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Well, I used to be able to do that when I was a kid.

2758
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:14,000
So I was watching, there's a buddy of mine that grew up in New Mexico that recently moved out to Maine, and I've been watching a lot of the stuff he's been playing.

2759
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:29,000
He knows Spyro, I don't remember if it's two or three, but he knows Spyro glitches, like the back of his hand, and he's getting really really good at getting the reproducible.

2760
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:45,000
He's speedrunning Shattered Memories, even though I don't think there's really, I don't think there's any glitches in it, he just finds the best path and skips through the sequences and cutscenes, the doctor sequences as much as possible, as quick as possible, all that kind of stuff.

2761
02:42:46,000 --> 02:43:05,000
And that speedrun is literally just learning the best path to the game, but I revisited some of those awesome games on quick videos from the summer, and somebody was speedrunning Super Meat Boy just Light World Clear, I don't think he did Dark Worlds, but they also got Team Meat in on Skype.

2762
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:15,000
And the programmers of the game didn't, they were shocked that they had never heard of some of these bugs before.

2763
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Whether they went and fixed them after the factor, figured out why they're happening, I have no idea, but just the level of dedication that, whether they stumble across it randomly or with skill, completely phenomenal, and everything about that production is so fantastic.

2764
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Great charity, great video, great skill. I didn't know they do it twice a year, so I'm definitely looking forward to being able to watch that in a week or two.

2765
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Did you know Dan and I actually tried for like an hour each trying to learn the wall jump in Super Mario 64 so that we could get up to the roof and beat the game?

2766
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
I had heard of that, I don't think I ever tried.

2767
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:55,000
There's videos up, and apparently it's supposed to work in the DS version as well.

2768
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:01,000
I don't have the precision to play that on Mario 64 DS.

2769
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Alright, that is it for the mailbag.

2770
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Indeed, that is it.

2771
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:13,000
This is also your very last chance to vote in tonight's List List. You're already slackin' if you waited this long, this is your last chance.

2772
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Live.vognetwork.com, and we will read the answers here shortly, but first we have the FUs of the week. Here we go.

2773
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

2774
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:49,000
I feed a pink berry for having peppermint and chocolate because it was so good and I want more, but I've had wine tonight, so no pink berry.

2775
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Wine's really good though, do you need any wine flavored pink berry?

2776
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:59,000
No, you know what though they had in Japan last year, Rob? They had muscat grape KitKats.

2777
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:07,000
And they were amazing. My friend who lives in Nagoya sent, you remember my friend Julie, right?

2778
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:15,000
And our friend Krista? Krista lives in Nagoya? She sent Julie a bunch of muscat KitKats and we went through the whole box.

2779
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:22,000
They're amazing. Okay, pink berry, get muscat flavor. Do it.

2780
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Alright, Loki, you have some FUs of the week?

2781
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:34,000
I feed my cat who thinks I'm a pillow or something. She's literally an inch away from the microphone.

2782
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Alright, Jason, do you have any FUs?

2783
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:46,000
I have nothing against alcohol, but FU do excuses to get smashed at 11 in the morning.

2784
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:48,000
Oh yeah, that's a bit much.

2785
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:50,000
That's what they do to people.

2786
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:57,000
I was like, you're not gonna dog our wine drinking, are you? Gotta be responsible. We always advocate responsibility as well.

2787
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:04,000
My FU of the week goes to, FU did the scare that Alan might be getting sick again and therefore I might be getting sick again.

2788
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
I was just sick. I don't want to be sick again.

2789
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Hey, you should be more concerned for Alan being healthy so Alan can be healthy.

2790
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:12,000
No, I want to be healthy.

2791
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:14,000
So rude.

2792
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,000
But yes, it would be nice.

2793
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Alan, do you hear this fuckery?

2794
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Yes, it would be nice if Alan was healthy too.

2795
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Alright, there it is. That is it for the FUs of the week. What are you laughing about over there?

2796
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Nothing.

2797
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,000
You trying to start some shit? That's what you're trying to do over there.

2798
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
No, I'm not. But you know what? I do want pink berry right now.

2799
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Of course you do.

2800
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:35,000
And I don't want to get sick either.

2801
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Alright, that is it. We are done-zo with the question tonight from the listless question there.

2802
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:49,000
I'm just waiting for the answers to load in there and we can tell you what the top answers were.

2803
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Here it is, the definitive list. Our predictions for 2014. Here we go.

2804
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Your number three answer. Where's Alan? Alan? There he is. Number three answer.

2805
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Number three answer. Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA.

2806
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:06,000
So there you go. Number three is the winner.

2807
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Yay.

2808
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:10,000
And I didn't mean what I said earlier.

2809
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Alright, don't cough up my mic.

2810
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Alright, the number two answer. Here it is. Number two answer.

2811
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.

2812
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:31,000
And the number one answer, the thing that absolutely has to happen in 2014 as voted on by the listeners.

2813
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,000
And thank God a shiny happy answer won after the dark places we went to tonight.

2814
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled. There it is.

2815
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,000
Very good.

2816
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
We're all nice people after all.

2817
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Sometimes. Eventually.

2818
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:56,000
There it is. The definitive list. Again, that is Fallout 4 confirmed. F-Zero Boner Party and innovation leading to advances for the disabled.

2819
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
There it is. Thank you guys for participating in List List tonight.

2820
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:06,000
We hope to do that again. We have gone too long since the last time we played that game, so we will have to do that again very soon.

2821
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:10,000
So there it is. That is it for the mailbag, the stories.

2822
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:20,000
We are now ready for your calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2823
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,000
It is that time to give us a call.

2824
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Now I'm going to apologize in advance. We're doing something a little different with the Skype line tonight, and so I'm getting to test this live on air as we're going.

2825
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,000
So please bear with us.

2826
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:39,000
But with this setup, we do not have to say goodbye to Loki. He can stay on the line and chat with our Skype calls.

2827
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:47,000
If you want to talk to Loki or anybody here in the studio or give your own thoughts on what happened in 2013 or what you'd like to see in 2014, give us a call right now.

2828
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:53,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. One word.

2829
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Meanwhile, some last minute stories, possibly, maybe. Loki, do you have anything for last minute stories tonight?

2830
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:01,000
No, sadly I don't.

2831
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Yeah, there's really not a whole heck of a lot going on, is there?

2832
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:10,000
So let me see if we have any Twitter topics. I'm going to try to pull those up real quick here again while we wait for some calls.

2833
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:15,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word.

2834
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:17,000
You know, I hope it works.

2835
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Do you know they have a new toll-free prefix coming up?

2836
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Do they really?

2837
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

2838
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,000
They're just kind of going down the list of all the 800s, eight double digits.

2839
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:33,000
I shouldn't be surprised that they're running out of stuff or whatever.

2840
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Considering how dirt cheap it is for anybody to pick one up now, and it's only getting easier.

2841
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:44,000
It's weird that for that reason, it's not weird for that reason that non-phone number based systems aren't coming up. What the hell am I saying?

2842
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Alright, we are getting a call, so let's get to it. We are going to go to the phones right now and take a call.

2843
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2844
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Hey, this is Act F.

2845
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Hey Act F, what's on your mind, buddy?

2846
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:01,000
Well, first of all, did it work?

2847
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Yes, it worked. We can hear you just fine.

2848
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Okay. Well, I was thinking about Jason's, one of Jason's answers. I think it was number one on the list list.

2849
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,000
The indie game going triple A development.

2850
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:25,000
And I was thinking about the My Little Pony fighting game that sees and desists.

2851
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Why are you laughing, Jason? You're laughing like crazy over there.

2852
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Because this doesn't surprise me, I guess.

2853
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Of course you're thinking about the My Little Pony game, right?

2854
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Well, I was thinking about that, and now they're working on their own game. Their own original game.

2855
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:57,000
And I was thinking about and hoping that possibly it could get picked up like a big publisher or something.

2856
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:05,000
And get a big release. Something like, well, maybe possibly like Skullgirls.

2857
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:10,000
It was a small release, but then it got big.

2858
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:18,000
I was going to say, to be fair though, Skullgirls wasn't really a triple A title.

2859
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
I mean, I know it has a lot of fans, but it's not exactly triple A.

2860
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:25,000
I'm not knocking it. I'm just saying. Right?

2861
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Well, maybe not that big, or maybe not triple A, but big. Mostly.

2862
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

2863
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:42,000
What else? Any gaming resolutions you have for 2014? Or no, we read one of your answers during the Google answers, right?

2864
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Yeah, one of my Google... Well, one of... Sorry.

2865
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Something beeping over there?

2866
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Was that the Power Rangers theme? What was that? Yeah.

2867
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Yeah, it was my phone. Sorry.

2868
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Well, yeah, you already read my resolutions, and sorry again. Damn it.

2869
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Stop texting actdeft. He's on the radio, people.

2870
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Well, there we go. Yeah, all my game resolutions are mostly a new PC for gaming, because my current one is good, but not that great.

2871
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Mostly the processor is old, so I need to at least replace that.

2872
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:27,000
And yes, Matt, it was a Power Rangers ringtone.

2873
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Yes, it was. Alright. Oh, go ahead.

2874
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Yeah, my other resolution, the HDTV, is my top priority right now, because I have the gaming consoles, and even the PC, which I have, the video card has HDMI out, so I can use that for gaming, too.

2875
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:55,000
It will probably happen soon, since I'm pretty much saving the money for that.

2876
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:12,000
So yeah, that's mostly what I want to do next year, and of course, my hundreds and hundreds of games on Steam, and not to mention an Xbox. I have the Xbox games that I haven't finished, so I need to get on that.

2877
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:17,000
There's too much to play, but it's not exactly a bad problem to have, right?

2878
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
Yeah, too much to play in so little time.

2879
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Alright. Well, Act F, buddy, we're going to let you go to try and get some more calls, but thanks so much for the call, and have a great new year.

2880
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:27,000
Thank you, you too.

2881
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Alright, take care, buddy.

2882
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line once again for some more calls, over at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2883
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word. Skype line's open right now.

2884
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:49,000
I was going to try to get to some Twitter topics while we wait for another call here, if I can.

2885
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:55,000
I want to read a tweet. We had something from YYR, and I want to make sure I got this one, because this is really funny what happened here.

2886
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Okay, YYR sent us a tweet here on Twitter, and it says, the number one downloadable 3DS game in Japan this year, Bike Rider DX.

2887
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:10,000
Why? It's awesome. It's $2.99 in the North American eShop. Buy it, OLR.

2888
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Alright, and get this. It was retweeted by who? The makers of the game. Look at that. Retweeted by the makers of the game.

2889
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:24,000
So, very cool there. So yeah, I guess I'll have to check that out. I don't know much about that game.

2890
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:28,000
Is it like a site bike? Because that's kind of what it looks like to me, just based on what little I see here.

2891
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:32,000
I'm trying to see if there's some of the pictures here. Looks like a lot of this stuff is just retweeted.

2892
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:38,000
Oh no, it doesn't actually look like a site bike at all. It's more like a little 2D platformer type of thing.

2893
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:41,000
That's kind of cute. For $2.99, I'd try it.

2894
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:49,000
So it's probably a style of game not terribly unlike Trials, where more lean mechanics and physics and all that kind of stuff.

2895
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Yeah, it might be a little more something like that.

2896
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:58,000
This is a very attractive looking game. I've never heard of this before. 3DS eShop. I know what purchase I'm making in the future.

2897
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:03,000
I was like, I think I might actually have enough left in my wallet now that it's shared between Wii U and 3DS.

2898
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Because I put like $10 in the other day when I bought Castlevania and stuff.

2899
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Which, I know I don't have to do that, but whatever.

2900
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Again, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, orange on radio, last chance to call the show ever in 2013.

2901
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:23,000
So give us a call and we'll talk. Do I have other tweets? Let me look.

2902
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:28,000
Let's go to other tweets. Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet for a future week.

2903
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Although I'm going to be real honest, I tend to only see the stuff the day of the show.

2904
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
S2100matt sent us a tweet.

2905
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Nine year an MVP baseball lot lives on through the Latin American mod community with the MVP Carby.

2906
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
I have no idea what this is even talking about.

2907
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:54,000
I think it's Caribe. Because it was a... I don't know all of the backstory about this because I haven't followed a lot of baseball video gaming stuff.

2908
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:01,000
But it's basically along the lines of a classic MVP baseball game totally modded for newer rosters.

2909
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
I remember this game that's right and it's been long gone.

2910
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:10,000
So it's been gone for ten years, this MVP baseball, because a licensing deal fell through for them ten years ago.

2911
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:19,000
But things live on thanks to this remake essentially that's on the PC which is a celebration of Latin American baseball.

2912
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,000
That's pretty cool.

2913
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Okay, now I get it. I have heard of this game before and you can check that out.

2914
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:31,000
So if you like your baseball, Latin American baseball, you can check that out.

2915
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Let's see, trying to find some other tweets here over at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2916
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Gemet Hunts tweeted us earlier this week and put, or actually it was just yesterday, saying,

2917
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Oh God, Sky, O-L-R, I got started on Tiny Death Star this week and also, yes, I know I'm a bit behind on shows.

2918
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:55,000
That's fine. Not everybody can listen the week of the show.

2919
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:00,000
But I was just going to say, I finally quit Tiny Death Star just before they put in the holiday stuff.

2920
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
So I'm glad I got you hooked on a game that I quit.

2921
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Play the Doctor Who game instead. Damn it, Brad.

2922
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Brad was telling me about that game. Is it? How much is it on iOS?

2923
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Free.

2924
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:14,000
I like that.

2925
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
It has the stupid transaction thing again.

2926
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:22,000
But, um, you don't need any of them. I haven't ever used any and they give you freebies all the time.

2927
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:24,000
All right.

2928
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:32,000
I think I've just, uh, I've been replaying levels actually to unlock characters until I got, uh, the Sontaran Butler.

2929
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:37,000
And I can always forget that guy's name, but like I have River Song now. I'm very happy.

2930
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:42,000
All right. Uh, I'm going to give one more shout out for the Skypline and see if we get anybody.

2931
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:48,000
That's weird. No, everybody's, everybody's shy here on the last night of the year. 1-8-7-7 Game O-L-R or username.

2932
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:54,000
I was worried that the setup didn't work because I have things run differently tonight, but, uh, Act Def got through. So I know it works.

2933
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
No, I think that they're being reflective on the year.

2934
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:01,000
They're just being quiet and pensive on the year? Perhaps?

2935
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:03,000
I think so.

2936
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:08,000
So there's a, there's a lot of Doctor Who games that all have subtitles. Do you know what the subtitle for this particular one is?

2937
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Crap. Let me look it up because I have my hand.

2938
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:17,000
I'll do a couple other quick tweets if I can real quick. Um, there was a tweet. This was, I remember this email from last week.

2939
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:26,000
I don't know if you guys remember this email last week from CK Ender who was kind of giving us another perspective and I believe it was the email on the NSA and it was kind of making us think differently about that.

2940
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:31,000
Well, CK Ender sent us a tweet and said, thanks for reading my email and giving it a fair shake. Great show this week.

2941
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Hey, you know what? Well thought out opinions. We're always, I'm always for presenting both sides of the story. So I'm all for that.

2942
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Uh, let's see. We also have another tweet from earlier this week from Dave Falcon who said to the OLR gang, Sky, Loki and Dark Sakura, hope you and your families have a great Xmas and best wishes for Happy New Year.

2943
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Well, thank you very much. Same to you.

2944
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:54,000
That was kind.

2945
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:58,000
That was very nice. All right. And Tiger Claw sent us one more tweet again. This is the last call for calls.

2946
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:04,000
I can't believe nobody's going to call in last show of the year except Act Deft. Are you guys going to let Act Deft have the final word this year?

2947
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,000
All right, 181.

2948
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:08,000
I think Act Deft has earned the final word.

2949
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:13,000
877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2950
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:18,000
Uh, Tiger Claw 305 sending us a tweet here and this is probably the last one for the year.

2951
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Porn discovered on 3DS purchased as Christmas present for 8 year old.

2952
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:25,000
I saw that.

2953
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:29,000
I can't believe this didn't make it in the show role. I even came across this this week and meant to put it in.

2954
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:31,000
Here's why I don't necessarily like.

2955
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:33,000
That was probably a bad choice of word.

2956
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:36,000
Well, this is why I don't necessarily like talking about this article.

2957
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
This really at its core has nothing to do with gaming.

2958
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:44,000
It's just shithead moves giving all of us a bad name.

2959
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:49,000
And I'm not saying you can't put porn on your 3DS. I don't care. Put all the porn you want on your 3DS.

2960
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:55,000
Get rid of it if you're going to sell it to a third party because A, you want to get rid of your personal data.

2961
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:57,000
B, what if that's you in that porn?

2962
02:59:58,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Most companies have a protocol for removal.

2963
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:01,000
Which this company should have done.

2964
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
In words and not in execution.

2965
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Yeah, but during the Christmas season.

2966
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:10,000
But is it, oh, it is a link to a local news story.

2967
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:12,000
Of course it's local news.

2968
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
I gotta bring it up here. I gotta see how the local news.

2969
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
If you guys aren't going to call us on Skype, then we're going to entertain ourselves here.

2970
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:20,000
You know what's worse?

2971
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:22,000
My local news.

2972
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:24,000
I actually recognize the station.

2973
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
It's Colorado's local. Denver's local NBC.

2974
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Well, let's see here. I'm going to try to bring this up here in studio real quick.

2975
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
Again, I did not screen this, so we're going to take a look at this.

2976
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:36,000
We're doing it live.

2977
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:38,000
Yeah, fuck it. We'll do it live.

2978
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:40,000
All right, let's see. Where is it? Where's the story?

2979
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
Oh, here it is. Wavy?

2980
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Davey Wavy News 10 reports on this story. Here it is.

2981
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:52,000
W-A-V-Y 10 on your side.

2982
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Wait, what? That's not...

2983
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:59,000
That's what it says. I was going to say W-A-V-Y is not out of Colorado. Is that out of Hampton, Virginia?

2984
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:03,000
I don't know what Twitter tweet you saw.

2985
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Oh, I went back to the previous years.

2986
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Okay, never mind. Proceed.

2987
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:10,000
You all right over there, Jason? You're malfunctioning.

2988
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:12,000
No, I just followed the wrong link.

2989
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:17,000
All right, let's go to this sensationalist local news report and take a look.

2990
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:19,000
I'm hoping there's not an ad here in the front.

2991
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Of course there's a...

2992
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:31,000
They want... It's a hilarious local ad for a car place that's selling tires with Santa shaking his butt there.

2993
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:36,000
Oh God, I know which part of Virginia this is. I've been here. All right, here we go.

2994
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:42,000
A family in Hampton finds sexual images on their son's new gaming console.

2995
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:46,000
They bought it for Christmas. Their son was the first to discover the disturbing images.

2996
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
10 on your side's Jason Marks is investigating...

2997
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:56,000
And they bought it for Christmas. I just... The way she singsong that really disturbed me.

2998
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Jason?

2999
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:03,000
Anita, that's the question everyone is asking. How could porn get on a newly bought Nintendo DS?

3000
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
How do people put things on memory codes?

3001
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:12,000
How does porn get on something connected to the internet? How does that happen? That blows my mind.

3002
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Jamie, how does porn get on an internet-enabled device?

3003
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Because someone owned it before.

3004
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Oh. Well, why did Channel 10 have to invent... All right.

3005
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Because they're stupid.

3006
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:27,000
Well, to be fair, we haven't seen this the whole way through.

3007
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:29,000
No, they're stupid. I looked at it. They're stupid.

3008
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:31,000
They're great for us playing this clip on the show.

3009
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:33,000
A gift that was meant for an 8-year-old.

3010
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:37,000
Normally he would be asking to play on his DS and hasn't yet.

3011
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:43,000
Sure. Any kid who just got a Nintendo DS Christmas morning would be chomping at the bit to play the system.

3012
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:48,000
But Tom Mayhew's 8-year-old son got an eyeful just after opening his gift.

3013
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:52,000
Later on during the day, he went to play his games, not knowing anything was on it.

3014
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:58,000
And then after a while, they took a picture of themselves, a couple of the kids that were here.

3015
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:02,000
And when the picture was taken, it went to a file.

3016
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
When that file was opened, there was already pictures on it.

3017
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Not just any pictures, images the Hampton 8-year-old should never see.

3018
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:15,000
It was a shocker because we had quite a bit of the family over, so there was a lot of kids here.

3019
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:19,000
And the kids were the ones that discovered those pictures.

3020
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:23,000
To be fair, I'm going to try to be Devil's advocate a little bit here, although it's difficult.

3021
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:28,000
But I mean, I can see where it's not like the pictures are front and center.

3022
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:32,000
They are buried a little bit in the 3DS. You do have to go into...

3023
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
The story as he's telling it makes perfect sense.

3024
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:40,000
When you open the 3DS, you don't think, oh, I better go in and check all the pictures.

3025
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:46,000
So it makes sense that, oh, the kids took the picture, they went to go look at the pictures of themselves in OMG boobs.

3026
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
The story makes sense.

3027
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:53,000
And the thing too is they bought it new. It wasn't like they were buying the U-System.

3028
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:55,000
So they claim.

3029
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:57,000
The text of the article...

3030
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:01,000
Well, they bought it from Walmart though, so Walmart doesn't sell U-System.

3031
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:03,000
Walmart does open box.

3032
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
Walmart will sell a return.

3033
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,000
Yeah, absolutely.

3034
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
Is Walmart a target? I can't remember which one. One of those.

3035
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Well, let's see. Because you know if it's 10 on your side, they're going to go to the store where the manager will refuse to give comment.

3036
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:20,000
Because that's what always happens in these stories. So let's see what happens.

3037
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:27,000
Or there will be a corporate statement and they'll have the text come up on the screen with the little image of the letter in the background because that's how the local news works.

3038
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
So let's see if my prediction holds out here.

3039
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:36,000
Mayu says the DS had a dozen pornographic pictures. Now he wants to know where they came from.

3040
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:38,000
Well...

3041
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:40,000
Why don't you ask the lady?

3042
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
Well, they could have been internet porno, who knows.

3043
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:51,000
...for them to really even be on there. It's disgusting for one. It seems weird that this was the only thing left on it.

3044
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Mayu first thought it was a Nintendo mistake, but now he has another theory.

3045
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:58,000
It's a big mistake.

3046
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:02,000
It's important to note that people will think that. They will think...

3047
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:04,000
They're dumb.

3048
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
Well, it's not that they're dumb. They just don't know better. There's a big difference.

3049
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:09,000
They're ignorant.

3050
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:15,000
What was interesting about this before... I immediately discarded this when it said pornographic.

3051
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:28,000
But it is known that as a part of QC testing, assembly line workers will take pictures of a unit of themselves or something along the line to make sure that the camera in the batch of systems works.

3052
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:40,000
There's a compendium of pictures from iPhones and iPads, iPods, all that kind of stuff, of Chinese factory workers because they're QC-ing the camera during assembly.

3053
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:42,000
But not 12 pictures of boobs.

3054
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
Yeah, this is a very different situation.

3055
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:52,000
Plus, if you could see the video, they look like internet MySpace blingy images that have boobs. I mean, that's what these things look like.

3056
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:56,000
I can't totally tell through the boobs, but this doesn't look like basement...

3057
03:05:56,000 --> 03:06:05,000
What's even more interesting about that is that means they were downloaded from a site because the DS doesn't have the ability to make those kinds of effects when you take a picture.

3058
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:15,000
These were not pictures. Yeah, you can save things, save images from the browser to the SD card or what have you, but it's interesting. It wasn't pictures...

3059
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:20,000
It wasn't made by the DS alone. It was actually connected to the internet.

3060
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
Sorry, I let it keep playing. Alright, let me let this finish here.

3061
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:28,000
And those things were not deleted from it, so it wasn't a new product. It was a used product.

3062
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:36,000
Mayu tells us the pictures were time-stamped in early December. He bought the system here at the Hampton Walmart at 23rd.

3063
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:45,000
Here we go. 10 on your side called the corporate office, and we're still waiting to get a call back. As we wait for answers, a father has come up with a question.

3064
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:53,000
Oh, so they didn't even get a comment yet. They just called the corporate office and no letter yet. Well, what's Walmart going to say to that?

3065
03:06:54,000 --> 03:07:01,000
Oh man, clearly an employee was putting boobies on our 3DS. Here's a gift card. Let me let this finish.

3066
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:07,000
Mainly is what is my youngest son thinking about those pictures being on there?

3067
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:14,000
Dad plans to soon have the talk with his son, a conversation he thought would only come several years from now.

3068
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:18,000
He's an eye-opener. Why would those even be on there?

3069
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Mayu says he found another clue that could show that there was a return system. The Nintendo DS comes with parental controls that require a password.

3070
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:36,000
On his DS, the parental controls were already set up, password included. As I mentioned, we're still waiting for Walmart to call us back.

3071
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
I don't remember going through that stuff.

3072
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
Walmart sold a return system as new. That's what they did.

3073
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:49,000
Yeah, alright, fine. Thank you. Thank you, Davey Wavy News for the clip there.

3074
03:07:50,000 --> 03:08:02,000
Well, to be perfectly honest, I think that especially if that was just a re-boxed return, then yeah, he's within his rights to, first of all, request a new system and have that sent back.

3075
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:14,000
Because clearly, it's, I'm trying to remember what it is too. You can't sell a used system without marking that it has been used or a refurb.

3076
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:25,000
That goes against, I'm trying to remember because I was reading up on the resale law too, just not too long ago. That has to do with truth in advertising.

3077
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
I see that at Fry's all the time.

3078
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:37,000
But Fry's will flat out say return. They have a big sticker on it that says this is a return. When you go to any other retailer, it will say refurbished.

3079
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:44,000
In the rush of the holidays, that didn't happen at this Walmart and now they're going to get raked through the coals for it.

3080
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:48,000
Well, I can't think of a company that deserves it more, but still.

3081
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:55,000
Going back to the beginning where this is all at, I hate that these things are considered gaming news because it really has nothing to do with the console.

3082
03:08:56,000 --> 03:09:02,000
It has nothing to do, but unfortunately, you heard the guy, this is the reality when stories like this come out, you heard the guy there.

3083
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:09,000
My first thought was it was something with Nintendo. And all of us that kind of know how these things really work, we saw the punchline coming a mile away.

3084
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:14,000
Somebody returned a system that was sold as new. And for all we know-

3085
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:16,000
It should be common sense regardless, but-

3086
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:22,000
This whole thing was probably a prank, if you think about it. The whole thing was probably a setup.

3087
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
There's probably some assholes watching the news, giggling.

3088
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:27,000
Oh yeah, absolutely. The whole thing is probably a setup.

3089
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:29,000
We showed that little kid some dick.

3090
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:31,000
Which is kind of fucked up in a way.

3091
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:36,000
Our plot twist, it was the news station that returned it with the porn on it.

3092
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:38,000
For ratings.

3093
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:40,000
For ratings.

3094
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:42,000
Trying to make some waves.

3095
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
I don't think either of those are the case.

3096
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:45,000
What do you think, then?

3097
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:47,000
I don't think it was a new system, and I don't think it was intentional.

3098
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:59,000
But it was a guy that did something, or perhaps not even a guy, but it was somebody that did something with the system and ultimately didn't want it because they didn't want to have to continue to pay for new things, so they took it back.

3099
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:04,000
It was just before- there's a myriad of other possibilities considering it was just before Christmas.

3100
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:11,000
I don't- I'm with you on the fact that this isn't gaming news, and this is just tripe.

3101
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,000
If that's even the correct word to use in this situation, but-

3102
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:16,000
This is slow news week news.

3103
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:18,000
Alright, fair enough.

3104
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
Alright, well that is gonna do it. I'm gonna close up the Skype line.

3105
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:29,000
How sad. I would have thought more of you would want to see our new studio cam on Skype, but I guess I'll have to wait until next week.

3106
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:31,000
Act-Def didn't say anything about it either.

3107
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,000
He was talking about it in chat.

3108
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:38,000
I would have thought the first caller would have been like, whoa, I can see you guys now, but we thought-

3109
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:42,000
You know, if we get one more caller, I'll even be willing to let it point at me.

3110
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:44,000
Too late?

3111
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:50,000
It will have to be a 2014 enhancement to the show, except Act-Def got a sneak peek because he was willing to call.

3112
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:56,000
We're gonna close up the Skype line, and we're gonna close up shop here at Orange Lawns Radio for the night and for the year.

3113
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:00,000
And thank you guys as always for being here. Thank you for listening to the show.

3114
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:06,000
Thank you for supporting the show all year long, whether you're new this year or you've been listening for the past eight years.

3115
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:12,000
We really appreciate your support. If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or five about the show. Really, really appreciate it.

3116
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:16,000
Spread the word about Orange Lawns Radio. That's all we have, is word of mouth.

3117
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:18,000
I did have a last minute story real quick.

3118
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:20,000
Oh, you do? Okay.

3119
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:22,000
Well, go for it.

3120
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:38,000
Okay. Apparently at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress, which is a hacker con, they demonstrated that they have cracked the Nintendo Wii U game pad controller to allow streaming of PC content to it.

3121
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
So you can use it almost like Nvidia's shield.

3122
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:43,000
Oh, wow.

3123
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:57,000
And so it's obviously early and a little bit buggy, but they're releasing code up there to make that happen. Apparently they're building tools to allow that to stream stuff on Windows and OS X.

3124
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:05,000
CCC is an amazing collective. They do some fantastic shit. I love them so much. This is great news.

3125
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,000
Didn't they also crack the Wiimote?

3126
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:25,000
I don't remember what name went behind that. If you caught the news about the lifting fingerprints off the phone in order to fake out the iPhone 5S's fingerprint sensor, that was also a CCC project.

3127
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:35,000
They are based out of Germany and a coworker of mine has been to a handful of their meetups before. If I ever find myself in Germany, I would love to go.

3128
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:46,000
Alrighty. Some thoughts in our chat room. Ragenator saying, here's a thought on the porn story. What are the odds that a parent, probably the dad, was testing out the system before it was wrapped?

3129
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:50,000
Forgot that the pics were on the system and when the pics were discovered, the parents tried covering their asses.

3130
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:56,000
You know, crazier things have happened in the world, but in this case, I don't really think that's gonna happen.

3131
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:58,000
You know what's interesting?

3132
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:00,000
My finger slipped on the trigger.

3133
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:05,000
Well, the problem too is the date stamp is different. The date stamp is earlier than he purchased it.

3134
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:13,000
That's true. Alright, well anyway, we really are gonna wrap up the show. I don't wanna talk, for the first time in my life, I don't wanna talk about porn anymore.

3135
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
Alright, that is gonna do it though for another episode.

3136
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:18,000
It's a Christmas miracle!

3137
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:20,000
Christmas is over.

3138
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:24,000
Here you go, kid. Dick. You get dick for Christmas.

3139
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,000
Alright, that's it. We're done. We're outta here.

3140
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,000
Thank you guys so much for supporting the show, and again, tell a friend about the show.

3141
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:31,000
We're gonna go around and get final thoughts.

3142
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:34,000
Jason, thank you for being here, taking the trek from the Bay Area to be here.

3143
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
I'm hoping we can at least do one show in your neck of the woods at some point.

3144
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:39,000
It will be wonderful if it comes to fruition.

3145
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:45,000
That's a goal for 2014, one of our goals, a road show. A legit road show, cause we haven't done one in a while.

3146
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:54,000
We haven't done one live since OLR was on live 365. I know we did DDR tournaments. I think that was the last time we did a full on live show.

3147
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:56,000
I think. Don't quote me on that.

3148
03:13:57,000 --> 03:14:00,000
I guess the E3s don't count because they were special mini shows during the week and not Sunday shows.

3149
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:07,000
Oh! We did the All Games frat house, as I called it.

3150
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:11,000
But it was the arena lounge thing they had back in all games.

3151
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:18,000
We did do a live show there, during one of the E3s. That would probably be the last time we did a full on show, start to finish, remote.

3152
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:20,000
That was a really cool set up.

3153
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:22,000
It was only a couple years ago.

3154
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:24,000
It was, what, 2006 I think?

3155
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:26,000
Like I said, just a couple.

3156
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:28,000
That was good memories though.

3157
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:30,000
Okay, that's it. We're gonna go around and get final thoughts.

3158
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:32,000
Jason, now is your turn. What's your final thought?

3159
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:34,000
Merry fucking 2014 people.

3160
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:36,000
Good final thought.

3161
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:39,000
Loki via the skype line. Your final thought?

3162
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:46,000
Looks like Grand Theft Auto 5 is becoming the hacker fest as Grand Theft Auto 4 was.

3163
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:50,000
It's supposed to be interesting how they slap the wrists of all these people doing that.

3164
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:52,000
I've been hearing that actually.

3165
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:57,000
What a shock. I am so shocked that somebody has hacked Grand Theft Auto 5. This is so surprising.

3166
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:01,000
We made it so easy. That's the problem.

3167
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:08,000
My final thought tonight is, I feel really good. This has been a really good year for the show.

3168
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:13,000
One of our best since probably, and I'm not really talking quality. This show is always good.

3169
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:15,000
We always try to bring it every week.

3170
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:22,000
But just in terms of the growth of the show and everything, this has been probably our best year since podcasting went live.

3171
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:26,000
So I just really want to thank everybody again for their support and the new listeners we've got over the year.

3172
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:31,000
And just thank you for being a part of our little family here on Sunday nights. Really appreciate it. Thank you.

3173
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,000
Dark Soccer, last but not least, the final word of 2013.

3174
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:38,000
I'm actually going to retire reject false icons because Gorillaz is gone.

3175
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:40,000
Did they officially?

3176
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
I think Gorillaz is officially over because Blur is touring again.

3177
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:45,000
I see.

3178
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:47,000
But I have a new one for you guys.

3179
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:51,000
Think before you speak and think before you type.

3180
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:54,000
Alright. Think before you speak, think before you type.

3181
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:57,000
In other words, don't be an asshole.

3182
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:02,000
That's the number one rule of gaming online. Don't be a dick. Unfortunately, way too many people do it.

3183
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:08,000
Alright guys, we will see you in 2014. Have a safe new year, whatever it is you're doing.

3184
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:14,000
If you are doing any drinking, do not drive. Do not drive. Do not drive. Have your plan to get home.

3185
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,000
And don't get married if you drink.

3186
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:21,000
Don't have a Britney Spears wedding. Don't have sex.

3187
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:24,000
Okay, well if you're going to have sex, be safe. Alright, have a great night everybody.

3188
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:28,000
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio in 2014. Good night.

3189
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:31,000
