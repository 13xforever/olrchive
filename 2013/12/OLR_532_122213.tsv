14397	16238	Tonight, we're going to take it a little bit easier.
16518	21522	Christmas is right around the corner and we're all getting presents from Nintendo, Rockstar, LucasArts, and Ortale.
21763	25946	Help us unwrap all the goodness contained within this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
31892	36435	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36495	43679	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this December the 22nd, 2013, episode number 532.
45581	52805	My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and gamer et cetera, et cetera, with my co-hosts.
52985	56207	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56408	58149	I'm wearing my Charlie the Unicorn shirt tonight.
58929	60391	How are things going for you?
85373	87295	Actually, I am pretty happy today.
87535	93479	I am officially down one whole jean size since I started my exercise and fitness program.
93519	97381	You have been on quite the little weight loss quest and you've been very successful in that.
97482	103145	Well, the numbers on the scale don't matter to me as much as the inches I've gone down.
103225	105047	Sure, it's one thing to see the numbers on the scale.
105107	108329	It's another to put on a pair of pants that used to not fit and then they do.
108829	110290	Because I'm also doing a lot of weight lifting.
111251	114133	And the first thing that happens when you lift weights is you actually do gain weight.
115033	116874	But muscle burns more.
117174	119055	It boosts your metabolism more.
119075	121916	I have to eat a lot more, which is great because I love to eat.
122517	123877	Who doesn't?
124057	126859	I actually had to increase my caloric intake by 200 calories.
127099	127519	Who doesn't?
127559	133341	You know, my work holiday party went out for spaghetti, and I was like, I can't think of a better food right this time of year.
133401	134462	Spaghetti is the best.
135126	136869	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
151909	156933	So you were posting in the VOG forums about this stuff, trying to get others to join you or whatever, right?
157073	167801	I have an account on Nerd Fitness, and I linked my account on the VOG forums, but I would actually, because people come in on the New Year and really think, I'm going to do it this time, and then they go, no.
168221	170103	Well, I am here to be everybody's life coach.
171824	173666	I actually want to do something with everybody.
173686	175247	Don't worry, Jamie will fix it.
175548	176208	Work harder!
177209	177850	Lift more!
178250	178750	Eat less!
179111	186758	I actually really would like to encourage, and the whole reason, I'm not doing this for the weight or anything, even though that was part of it.
187458	191502	What I'm doing this for is because I actually feel a lot better.
191962	193143	I have a lot more energy.
193864	195986	I don't have as bad fatigue problems as I used to.
196366	197567	I don't get sick as often.
198829	210483	Since this is a video game show and you mentioned that you wanted to pick up a DDR habit again once a week, do you believe that the extra gaming and the exercise, the fitness gaming and all that, do you believe that that really can help a person turn around?
210774	213076	I do, and I'm going to tell you why DDR I think is better.
213716	217539	Because I've been studying... Most of the time I do weightlifting, right?
218160	223804	But there's another thing that they talk about that's called high-intensity interval training, which is pretty much what DDR kind of is.
224684	229228	Of course, if you don't know what DDR is, Dance Dance Revolution, that game with the arrows and the floor mat, you know...
230128	239234	The whole point is to push your hardest limit for like a minute, and then you spend two minutes doing it at a more normal pace.
239635	244838	So in this case, it would be starting off with a nine-footer, doing two medium or easy songs.
244898	247800	It would still be important that you're still walking in between your songs.
248541	250782	That's the point.
250882	256466	If you are the one playing the game and you have a three or four song game, your first one is going to be your hard one.
256826	258387	Your next three are going to be your cool downs.
258828	262010	You do another game, hard one, three cool downs.
262090	268074	That way you're getting your heart rate up for that high interval and then you're relaxing because the human body is meant to function.
268375	271737	We're not meant to run and do long distance and do endurance things.
272097	275180	We're meant to GTFO when there's an animal trying to bite us in the ass.
276220	278662	So we are built for fight or flight.
278923	284127	So playing DDR, and I was thinking about this, it was like this light bulb moment.
284387	287850	Playing DDR is high intensity interval training.
289108	294891	You do, you know, you play five games of DDR, you've done 25 minutes of exercise, roughly.
294991	296992	DDR itself's kind of on its way out, though.
297232	298813	But they're still everywhere.
299093	304656	I know we have a lot of longtime Bomani fans, and it pains to hear that, but let's be real, y'all, it's not what it used to be.
305277	311760	So, I mean, you just plan on playing the old versions, or, you know, yeah, you're right, there's still arcade machines in many places.
311780	311900	Yeah.
312040	313701	You can play the old versions at home.
313841	316102	I'm actually planning on modding a new dance pad again.
317223	321445	But I'd like to get to the arcade and get friends together and try to recapture some of the old fun.
322475	329460	But I think in general, it's finding your exercise where you enjoy it.
329880	333162	Because, I mean, the reason why I like lifting weights is I like feeling stronger.
334163	340227	I like being 5'2 and being able to lift an 80-pound weight over my head.
340447	344270	And my goal is by my birthday of lifting 120 pounds.
344330	347252	Because soon that'll be a person that you can lift over your head and throw.
347272	347352	Yeah.
347552	348673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
369685	371226	You are named after the Bionic Woman after all.
371246	374328	This kid has gotten lighter to me because I have gotten stronger.
374529	375189	Nice.
375409	376170	I didn't mean to go off on it.
376210	376970	No, that's okay.
377030	379392	I don't really have much of a kickoff topic tonight, so this is fine.
379412	381013	We can have a little extended hellos with everybody.
381394	385296	But we do want to move on and introduce our other co-host who's been sitting there patiently waiting to be introduced.
385637	388759	Joining us via Skype tonight, everybody, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
389299	390220	Yes, I'm at home.
390380	391381	Hey, how you doing, Loki?
392409	393329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
421209	421849	Thanks for watching!
434864	435944	Just have to be prepared.
459361	460622	No, that's probably not going to happen.
460882	465946	She's due at the end of January, but he's measuring two weeks ahead.
467607	473412	I think Josh was born at 37 weeks, so it's probably going to be the first or second week in January.
473832	477155	I think she's saying maybe two more weeks and he'll be born.
477765	487691	Well, you're being an awful... As they say in chat room, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
487791	491153	And you can join us in chat if you are listening live at live.vognetwork.com.
491513	496656	Travis Donovan, our buddy from Under Sedation Live, kicking off Loki Baby Watch 2013.
498837	500678	Although ActDev corrects him and says it could be 2014.
500978	502779	So 2013 to 2014.
503480	506782	And we already have the name picked out, although I can't say what it is yet.
506802	507442	Of course, of course.
507887	511372	The middle name does kind of tie into a video game.
512694	515758	A video game I don't play, but it's still a video game.
516139	516699	Interesting.
517260	520324	She asked me, so how should we spell that?
520404	523629	And so I spelt it out very specifically to be like the video game.
524614	550399	um Alan Alchemy Strider here you is the middle name um Alan Alchemy in our chat room I love this Alan Alchemy says Nelly control that's the wife of course Nelly control Loki now the baby is here lol JK I needed you to get off Skype I can't handle your Nintendo rants when they're happening where I can hear them now go get me Chipotle odds of that happening pretty slim all right um
551092	553094	She's out of the house until 8 o'clock.
553214	555956	She goes to her mom's house and takes Josh with her.
556116	559659	I have at least a couple hours with them gone.
560059	561880	There you go.
562321	569947	The thing is, though, of course, I think part of the charm of Orange Lounge Radio and the way we've done things for the past... What year are we on now?
569967	569947	12?
571188	571888	Is next year year 12?
572449	573089	I lost count.
573169	573930	I've literally lost count.
573970	574390	June it will be 12.
574450	575071	Okay, next year.
575091	575351	2014 is year 12.
577132	586060	So we've been on the air about 12 years, and I think part of the charm of the show and part of what makes our show a little different is the fact that we're all in the same room, usually.
586140	592105	And I realize there's an eleventy billion other podcasts that tape over Skype and do a great job over Skype.
592385	595488	Shit, my other show, Horde House, done over Skype, and we have a great time over there.
596008	617141	um but you know I if if when it comes down to all right well are we gonna force everybody to be in the same room and make Loki take a month off from the show or are we gonna have him on Skype I choose having him on Skype so we'll we'll deal we'll we'll deal with the Skype thing and have a little bit of a different chemistry over the next few weeks while we wait for uh Loki baby number two to be on the way
618533	622414	And I had Kitty Cam going, but we had to shut off because of bandwidth reasons.
622474	625775	She's sleeping anyway, so... Yes, there was Kitty Cam earlier.
625855	627916	We might do some type of cam in the coming weeks.
628016	635058	I'm hoping there's going to be a new cable modem in studio in the coming weeks, and then we can look at maybe pumping out a little more with the bandwidth.
635098	641941	But since we had some drops from live listeners in the past couple weeks, I got to watch what's going in and out, so...
643001	650144	Alright, but yeah, so Loki will be joining us over Skype, but it'll still be the same old same old, him doing his stories and talking about his gaming week in a moment.
650244	658708	But first, I have to introduce here in studio, he hasn't gone anywhere, well he wasn't here last week, but he's been spending the majority of the holidays here with us at Orange Tawns Radio.
659068	663250	Say hello to the voice of the show, Mr. Jason, VXJasonXVXYZLMNOP.
663630	664030	I made it!
664250	664651	You made it!
664691	665411	I finally made it back.
665611	666411	How you doing?
666571	669453	I am doing so much better than this time last week.
669513	671614	Well, you had that same plague that knocked a lot of us out.
671634	676956	Yeah, and it was the Saturday prior to the show.
677396	678257	No, that's impossible.
678277	679157	I would have missed Sunday.
679737	681318	Saturday was the worst of the two.
681538	689022	Sunday I actually felt okay, but considering that we're jam-packed around this table when all four of us are here, I said, you know, whatever.
689182	689282	I'm...
690082	697444	I'm ancillary and as much as I want to contribute, I'll pass because my voice was notably worse as well.
697964	700365	You can kind of hear it in last week's intro.
700825	704366	Now that I've told you that, go back and listen to last week's intro and you'll hear it.
704386	705646	You probably didn't notice.
705786	711988	I pushed really hard to make sure it was clean the whole time, but the whole rest of the day, just my voice disappeared and that was that.
712268	713589	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
732865	745273	I actually wound up, it's funny because I actually wanted to watch the show, but many of the live chatters may have noticed that I also didn't participate, and that would be because I wound up being on the phone for 10 hours with a customer.
745313	751077	I was on the phone from what was it, 6 in the evening until 4 in the morning or something like that?
751297	752218	It was kind of a
752318	753538	Thank you for watching!
775263	782549	So, you know, I mentioned this on a previous episode of the show, but you've been hard at work on our latest endeavor into putting the shows on YouTube.
782569	784690	I have been trying to expand our audience a little more.
784930	786352	And once again, thank you for that.
787032	790194	And you've been doing, I noticed you've been doing a little more.
790475	794097	And I realize there's a lot going on with YouTube, especially with gaming.
794177	795779	And we'll get into that a little later in the news.
795799	797280	And I'm sure y'all know what I'm talking about.
797520	799321	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
821299	844111	so what better way than putting these two together I haven't gotten terribly crazy last week's 531's edits were I did a silly little thing with the cover art for the intro the gaming week has been there for the last two or three episodes the classic game of the week rather the video that we played in studio has been on stream for the past three episodes I think
845732	858836	The two newer things that I did this time are that when you three were having this discussion about me last week, I put a little heart in the empty space in the top right-hand side.
860956	862097	Just fun, tiny little thing.
862137	863377	Left it up there for about 10 seconds.
863897	873462	But what I'm also doing is I'm also putting the fortune cookie, a little clip of the fortune cookie of the week as the end of the video while the outro is playing.
873522	881126	I put a clip of the fortune cookie message of the day there so that we can start linking and have that reference for visitors as well.
881246	885833	Let me explain what that is real quick because we have to remember there's a large base.
885853	888397	The podcast listeners are like, what's a fortune cookie?
889359	891582	Remember, we have a huge audience that isn't here live.
891803	892924	I mention it sometimes.
893025	894186	Well, not huge.
895589	896390	Let's not kid ourselves.
896530	897271	We have our podcast.
918913	920556	Here's our last little goodbye.
920636	924123	And so our fortune cookie message is always kind of like our sign off message at the end of the night.
924524	927971	And Jamie, for years and years, because we've been doing this for years.
927991	929635	I used to actually make up a fortune cookie message.
930185	943435	That's right, you used to, yeah, I think back in the days of OLR, you used to have like a little saying, and then it became a little more like, I guess, what you see on The Daily Show and The Moment of Zen and all that, when we were on All Games, and now that we're here on VOG, we just kind of would sign off with that, so, yeah.
943455	947858	I think my first one was, love is like wearing your pants on your face, it can make you a butthead.
952521	954063	Still so relevant to the day.
954083	954884	Wow, I know, right?
955164	957267	Some advice never changes.
957447	960190	You know what the best literal fortune I've ever seen was?
960210	961051	It was what Melody had.
961612	965377	Great things will happen when you... Oh yeah, she got that cookie once that was not finished.
965617	967319	Dan's got the best one too.
968540	969722	Every man has his enemies.
973333	982639	I got an X-rated one once because there used to be this restaurant up in Chico because I went to school for three years up in Chico, California, which was an interesting time in my life to say the least.
982979	986341	But they have the best Mongolian barbecue place up there.
986441	988122	The best I've ever had to this day.
989202	1008130	and I hope they're still good but I'll give a shout out because at least 10 years ago Hula's was the bomb up in Chico I don't know if we have any listeners up there in Chico but if we do, shout out and that place is the bomb and they used to, they don't anymore but 10 years ago you asked for the special fortunes or the pink fortunes and they would bring you the X-rated cookies
1009213	1038216	and they would be things that say like you know double your pleasure double your fun fuck twins or once I got one that says doesn't this cookie look like a cunt you know like sorry explicit tag but this one time we were with a big group of people like 12 people we were all eating the fortunes we had the special ones everybody's giggling and they were like what'd you get what'd you get and then when they came to me they're like Rob what's your fortune say what's your fortune say and I'm like I can't tell you because you know what you have to eat the cookie and
1038536	1039818	or the fortune doesn't come true.
1040258	1045964	So I, you know, taking my sweet ass time eating the cookie, enjoying every bite, really exaggerating it.
1046304	1048687	Finally, I get to opening my fortune and reading it out loud.
1049368	1051290	The fortune said, go fuck yourself.
1053596	1057918	and everybody at the table is like scream laughing because all that effort.
1057958	1058478	I know all that.
1058878	1063379	And of course, if I don't, you know, eat the cookie first, it won't come true.
1064380	1067261	So that was that was the best fortune I ever got was the one that was a cookie.
1067301	1068321	It told me to go fuck myself.
1068901	1069241	All right.
1069321	1075744	Anyhow, Travis says, Rob, prove you on the right to the seat to use the C word.
1077724	1079225	How am I supposed to prove that?
1080734	1085815	You know who, by the way... If you're offended by my use of that, sorry, but a cookie said it first.
1087776	1088836	Oh, I'm not supposed to say cookie.
1089096	1089576	I'm sorry.
1090756	1093477	No one has ever said that word as great as Bette Midler.
1094577	1096117	They called me all kinds of horrible things.
1096177	1102679	It started with a C and ended with a C. Me no like cookie.
1105521	1107662	So, anyway, now that we've earned our explicit tag.
1107722	1110884	Yes, uh... While I'm at it, Vagina Balls Anus.
1113725	1114046	Okay.
1114806	1115046	Wow.
1115466	1117868	Alright, uh, it is a show about... Happy Holidays!
1118168	1122250	Believe it or not, it's a show about video games, so, uh, we are gonna talk about video games.
1122550	1126012	I actually don't really have much of a kickoff topic tonight, uh, which is probably for the best.
1126252	1126632	I have one.
1126992	1127192	What?
1127312	1127653	I hate you.
1128613	1129414	Why do you hate me?
1129434	1130574	That's... You're telling me about Frivolow.
1131275	1131775	Oh, the wine?
1131935	1133876	You and... You and Victoria.
1133896	1133976	Yeah.
1135016	1154092	Goddammit, I drank a whole bottle of that shit And then I went and bought two more today So Victoria's wine addiction Jamie's wine addiction is the kickoff topic for tonight There you go, she's got a problem Yes, this is an intervention No, you can't have my frivolous Your frivolous is affecting your life negatively in the following ways
1155975	1180155	I was just gonna ask kind of just generally like what are your guys's plans for the holiday week and you know are you gonna be able to get a lot of gaming in or what I know I'll probably be playing a lot of games throughout this week because I don't do a whole whole lot for the holidays and you know I have a huge but would you say you don't have a whole whole whole lot get the fuck out of my house
1182793	1183795	Cool, he left his computer.
1184757	1185138	Bye.
1185960	1186321	Yeah.
1186842	1187363	Scram.
1187383	1189027	That's what I thought.
1194154	1195675	Jamie, do you have anything going on this week?
1195835	1198237	Games you're going to be catching up on or anything?
1199338	1203261	Well, I've been playing some Skullgirls, so I might play a little bit more of that.
1204202	1209387	Dan and I both took advantage of Steam sales and got the Angry Video Game Nerd game.
1210427	1213350	So that's on probably my list of new stuff to play.
1213720	1233188	I gotta vote for the next game so I can get my card I voted already I got my snow globe, you can't have it I definitely have the Stanley Parable I need to catch up on I bought that in the last sale That game is the fucking shit I love the Stanley Parable I've heard a lot of good things about it Jason, anything you're gonna plan on catching up on during the week?
1233248	1234188	When do you go back to Colorado?
1234849	1236091	I... February.
1236712	1237172	Oh, shit.
1237933	1239155	We're gonna have you... Completely serious.
1239295	1241218	We're gonna have you well past the holidays, aren't we?
1241439	1241799	Alrighty.
1242681	1244604	We'll be here to shoe in the new year.
1244844	1244944	Nice.
1244984	1245405	And then some.
1247127	1248530	Any gaming that you plan to catch up on?
1248970	1249070	Oh...
1252509	1252869	Not really.
1254690	1256490	There's no TV in the apartment.
1257351	1261172	We have a setup at the office and I could do that.
1262252	1264633	There will be games but no specific plans.
1266233	1267014	Loki, what about you?
1267074	1268114	I know you're waiting for the baby.
1271755	1272075	I don't know.
1272095	1273376	Maybe more Grand Theft Auto.
1273716	1278277	I was supposed to play this weekend because they had some multiplayer event but didn't do anything there.
1279238	1279418	And...
1281069	1286631	I've been playing Buy Things on Steam sale the game, so yeah, there's that.
1288171	1292873	Alrighty, so it sounds like everybody's just building up their backlog further of games to tackle.
1293673	1295154	Every sale, every sale.
1295294	1298035	I came so close to getting a PlayStation 4 this week, you guys.
1298915	1302616	And then finally I was just like, alright, but really, what are you going to play on it?
1303057	1306958	So I have to wait until there's a couple more games on it and then I'll buy it.
1307698	1309099	Multiplayer beta right now on it.
1309139	1310440	Ooh, the multiplayer's in beta?
1310480	1313102	Yeah, multiplayer's in beta, so you can actually play multiplayer if you want.
1334787	1335207	Nice.
1335828	1336749	Excited about that.
1337249	1339791	SSG100 Matt in chat says, I actually bought La Mulana today.
1339831	1340291	I missed that.
1340451	1341832	Yeah, I bought that today too.
1342093	1342453	Damn it.
1342693	1343454	It was like a buck.
1343914	1344534	I missed it.
1344695	1346676	I think I bought it for Thanksgiving sale.
1346896	1348698	It'll probably show up on a daily sale later.
1348778	1349939	Of course, absolutely.
1349959	1351700	Put it in your wish list so you get notified next time.
1352239	1352760	DarkSakura
1367325	1370746	Um, uh, well let's see, I bought La Mulana today.
1370886	1375467	I've been playing, I actually got back into Final Fantasy XIV, but I completely forgot what the fuck I was doing.
1375967	1381449	However, I did find I had another story quest to do, so that means I'll have to do my job quest for another few levels.
1381569	1383729	With that new patch now, it's like everything's changed.
1383749	1386850	Because now you can do a daily dungeon to get XP, you can do...
1387330	1388570	Guild Tests to get XP.
1388650	1390531	You can do the Guild Levs.
1390831	1392612	Now give a reasonable amount of XP.
1392652	1394932	You can do those as regular quests.
1395632	1397413	The patch really changed a lot.
1398653	1399673	Almost all of it's for the better.
1400214	1405195	Well, I've been, you know, I played for a little bit, but for some reason I was getting kind of stupidly motion sick.
1405715	1410216	And I really am trying not to play too much more until my computer upgrades finished.
1410757	1414177	Because Dan decided to bust out our friend the credit card.
1414978	1415398	And by...
1416779	1432391	New cases, new CPUs, new processors, new motherboards, USB adapters, and he's buying me a new sound card as well so that the rest of our computers catch up to our bitchin' graphics cards.
1433192	1440499	Seriously, it's like you have a graphics card that can handle a horde of 20,000 and a processor that can handle 10.
1441680	1442301	So, yeah.
1442701	1446085	Tired of my games choking up, so we've been sort of taking it a...
1447770	1466066	I've copied over so many things and I know Steam Cloud will back up my saves but I still want to you know like I've got all my Mass Effect stuff I have I'm going to have to manually repatch my Mass Effect 3 for the high res stuff because I don't want to have to go through the I mean I've got all the textures and everything saved and good thing I know how to do that but like
1466787	1468088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1491230	1510972	Alan did a really cool thing where online he used some website and maybe he can say it in chat but it's like a build your own PC site where you put in the components you want and it shows you what stores have it for the cheapest price so like how much your computer would cost overall I think it's like build a PC or build a PC he'll say it in chat here in a minute but he has like a computer for me saved on that site
1511556	1518718	Well, I'll tell you what we often do at Fry's, and I know Fry's isn't everywhere, but we have a little app called Shop Savvy.
1519298	1531241	It's for iPhone, Android, everything, where you scan the barcode on whatever component it is that you want, and since Fry's has to price match, that's their policy, you can use the Shop Savvy app and have them check it.
1532062	1536583	And so they'll still give you whatever the lowest price you find on it is, so you don't have to really go much of anywhere else.
1536763	1537303	Wow, nice.
1537903	1538963	Yeah, it's Shop Savvy.
1539023	1539724	Everybody use it.
1539904	1542284	I bought my copy of Battle Royale.
1542924	1544685	Instead of paying $20 at Best Buy, I paid $10.
1545265	1549826	I bought my Mass Effect 3 for $30 when it was still going for $50 something.
1550286	1551567	So, on the PC.
1552567	1553127	So I'm just saying.
1553227	1556188	PCPartPicker.com That is the website.
1556208	1556648	Thank you.
1556728	1558649	Mako said it and then Alan confirmed it there.
1558669	1559929	PCPartPicker, that is the site.
1560237	1564340	But other than that, I've been playing Animal Crossing and playing Zelda.
1565221	1565401	Awesome.
1565441	1569904	I can't get past the stupid fucking worm shit in the second fucking level.
1570244	1570805	God damn it.
1571926	1572366	You'll get there.
1572906	1577069	Well, it's like... And the same thing happened in The Link to the Past to me when I was...
1579295	1600593	14, 15, something and so it took me two hours to beat it on that one and I don't want it to take me that long because damn it, it's the 2010 era and I have no patience I want my gratification, give it to me so I turned off the game and drank half a bottle of wine works for me alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1603195	1604176	did Loki walk away?
1604256	1604596	Loki?
1605857	1606638	Loki, are you on mute?
1608632	1610795	Just a sec.
1611415	1612116	Baby's coming.
1612217	1613438	Everybody, show's over.
1613819	1615361	The wonders of doing a show on Skype.
1615421	1617965	Alright, Jason, why don't I just go to you while we wait for Loki?
1618525	1620849	I just bought the You Don't Know Jack Classic Pack for $5.
1621329	1622070	Did you really?
1622090	1622851	Thank you, Actdeft.
1622931	1623592	I seriously did.
1624473	1630839	And I can play none of them until I figure out how to work out a Windows box for my deluge of games that I cannot play natively.
1631339	1639146	Speaking of Windows and not being able to play natively, not exactly gaming, but I got a new-to-me laptop this week that is a Retina MacBook Pro.
1639867	1640808	It's kind of amazing.
1641729	1645993	It's very funny when websites and programs graphics are...
1647854	1665942	you can really start to tell when they cheaped out on saving the graphics because you look at the text, it's beautiful you look at everything else, it's terrible and smudgy it's really hilarious I am enjoying this laptop so far and it's so much lighter, oh my god, I can't even put into words even though I just did
1667223	1669865	I played a bit more Papers, Please this week.
1669925	1671566	I've heard a lot of great things about that game.
1671906	1673687	It is insanely fun.
1673707	1674448	It's on my list.
1674488	1681994	For something so frustrating, and you definitely get the demerit, the violation kind of...
1683294	1684214	Thank you for watching!
1706700	1714823	Um, I, Codeman sent me Surgeon Simulator as a gift, and that game is, I've been wanting to play it since I've seen videos.
1715444	1720346	I am hilariously bad at it, and I think everybody is, but it's so much fun.
1721646	1723907	And I picked up Electronic Superjoy for $1.50.
1724007	1724507	Woo!
1725127	1725688	Still need to play it.
1725988	1731550	So anyways, the real meaning for one is, this week I bought an Xbox One and PS4 controller.
1733544	1735445	I have not bought the systems.
1735485	1736766	They are here in my hands right now.
1736786	1737627	They are here in studio.
1737907	1739728	He brought them in here and he said, look what I bought.
1739788	1741309	And he handed me the PlayStation 4 controller.
1741329	1743310	Where's the consoles?
1743330	1744711	And I was like, you bought both consoles?
1744751	1745752	He's like, no, just controllers.
1745772	1747913	I'm like, you're so weird, Jason.
1748474	1753097	For some reason, I thought that I heard both controllers work natively with computers.
1753317	1754178	That's not the case.
1755479	1761764	As I also recently learned, and I posted this picture to Twitter, the Xbox One controller uses Wi-Fi.
1762444	1768749	And for that reason alone, game controllers via Wi-Fi on a computer are not a thing by default.
1769189	1772572	That said, the PS4 controller works over USB and Bluetooth.
1774053	1778637	When I first got it, I tried using Steam's big picture and playing games online.
1778777	1779278	Thanks for watching!
1798381	1801582	BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying to you, Jason, they said they would work eventually.
1801602	1804884	Yeah, they'll be, well, on Windows eventually, and then somebody will do a third-party one for the Mac.
1821129	1822490	Yeah, it'll happen next year.
1822630	1824352	A bit disappointing that I can't use it already.
1827014	1827555	It's interesting.
1827755	1829997	The Xbox One controller has the right heft.
1831278	1836683	And the PS4's triggers, L2 and R2, don't feel quite right.
1838360	1843785	But when I actually, and that was my initial reaction when I actually sat down and played the game, it didn't make a difference.
1844065	1847308	They both worked, tactile, responsive, felt right.
1847768	1850971	The Xbox One's D-pad is so much better.
1851611	1854013	Even better than the Xbox 360 Pro controller.
1854033	1855875	Yes, yes, a hundred times yes.
1856515	1861900	The PS, I'm sorry, the Xbox One controller is so clicky in like the best way though.
1862000	1870894	Maybe I just have fat thumbs, but when I do like, let's say I'm doing a Hadouken move on the little control pad there, my thumb like bumps the other thumb stick.
1871014	1872616	That's the only little problem I have.
1873277	1874359	Maybe I just have big thumbs.
1874399	1874619	Interesting.
1876206	1876626	Thanks for watching!
1895601	1900505	and so I went out and bought the original full-size fatty Xbox controller for myself.
1900585	1905849	Those wired 360 controllers though made bomb and still do like PC controllers.
1905869	1907130	That's exactly why I bought them.
1907150	1907830	That's what I'm using.
1907931	1909832	They are the best gamepad you can get.
1909992	1910272	Me too.
1910292	1912594	I'm very happy with this PS4 controller so far.
1913054	1916357	Much more than my Logitech something something something.
1916707	1935885	I'm going to the chatroom, live.vognetwork.com TigerClaw with another theory Jason basically bought those controllers so he can get a handle on how they feel and practice using them when he gets either of the consoles It's okay, I'm still going to suck at all the games especially if I play it against other people that actually own it but I appreciate console gamepads and I'm happy with them
1936926	1939689	Alright, so... I like that you can push the little touchpad.
1939709	1943032	Yeah, I don't know how many people know this, but the touchpad is actually a button.
1943672	1949217	The touchpad doesn't work on a computer, but the fact that it is a button and can be depressed does actually work.
1949578	1950839	It may work on a computer someday.
1951299	1952240	Yeah, eventually.
1952661	1953642	Out of the box, yeah.
1954863	1959707	Saw a new game that will be out next year that is in the show role, so I'll leave it for later, but it...
1961048	1969734	I would have screamed loudly in enthusiasm had there not been another housemate in the apartment that I'm staying in, and also in an apartment.
1969754	1970395	You would have shrieked.
1970775	1971256	I would have.
1971356	1977240	I would have nerd shrieked, nerdgasmed, and nerd other expletives that I will leave for your imagination.
1977920	1978181	Right.
1978881	1980702	On that note, I think Loki's back.
1980742	1981263	Hi, Loki.
1981403	1982163	Sorry about that.
1982203	1984265	Yeah, my mom called me.
1984639	1985439	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2006304	2008325	I checked out some of the servers on there.
2008345	2011685	I picked just a random one and I'm playing it a little bit.
2011945	2012726	So it's pretty fun.
2012746	2016066	They had all their weapons and purchasables free.
2016566	2017687	So that was kind of neat.
2018207	2021328	And then I played a little bit of Saints Row 4.
2021688	2027549	I mentioned before that I bought the season pass for DLC when it was on sale.
2028129	2031930	And so I got a chance to finally play through, enter the dominatrix.
2032717	2050867	which was as expected incredibly short and unfortunately the whole joke that they were trying to go with it the whole mockumentary thing just wasn't very funny and thank god they didn't ever release Enter the Dominatrix as a full game because it would have been fucking terrible
2051727	2068224	and in fact the whole thing there's only one time that I laughed in it which was at the very end of the game where you friend these raptors and so you're riding the raptors out of the simulation while they're singing this song of their people which is
2068976	2070117	Walk the Dinosaur.
2070137	2076140	So that was kind of funny, but the rest of it just wasn't funny at all.
2076280	2082224	That's unfortunate to hear it's not that funny, because I associate Saints Row with one of the funniest games I've played.
2083785	2094891	They tried to do some stuff that's supposed to be funny, like some of the cutscenes were animatics and literally some dude holding an action figure and doing something, and like
2095484	2095904	I don't know.
2095944	2099045	I guess that was supposed to be funny, but it just wasn't funny.
2099465	2100765	It's like they were trying too hard.
2101885	2102365	Fair enough.
2103685	2107606	And then... I bought lots of things.
2109646	2115307	I really wasn't going to spend a ton of money on the seam sale, but... That's what they all say, Loki.
2115427	2116668	That's what they all say.
2118128	2120088	So, let's see what I picked up here.
2120128	2123209	The orange box, because surprisingly enough, I didn't have that.
2123909	2124029	Um...
2125284	2152559	Noidu Love 2 Demvolution which is kind of like a sprite based shooter Retrograde which is kind of a space shooter slash rhythm game which is kind of neat the whole game plays backwards and so you basically have to move where bullets came from and it goes with the music then there's Ballpoint Universe Infinite which is a hand drawn game
2154390	2164735	and Blockland which is very much like Minecraft but it actually looks like Legos so that's kind of neat and they have a whole deathmatch thing with that as well.
2165495	2176080	Final Fantasy 7 and then of course Cody got me the Stanley Parable so that was pretty sweet and then today I had to pick up La Mulana because it's down to like a buck something.
2177380	2178281	Can't believe I missed it.
2178681	2179161	So upset.
2179961	2182683	You can always catch the yesterday sales though.
2182923	2183583	They repost them.
2184011	2184931	Oh, wasn't that a flash sale?
2185271	2185652	I don't know.
2185692	2186932	It was a flash sale, yeah.
2187172	2187912	It'll come up again.
2188132	2190753	I'm not worried about it.
2190833	2192014	So, yeah, pretty much that.
2192194	2195535	And then I don't think I actually played any Grand Theft Auto Online.
2195555	2196975	They've been doing some mass bannings.
2196995	2198756	Thankfully, I didn't get caught up in that.
2199336	2202637	But, yeah, that's it.
2202677	2209940	Just trying to get through the DLC stuff for Saints Row 4 since my save got pretty much eradicated.
2210200	2212821	And so I've been kind of running through that real fast.
2213607	2220922	and I still haven't unlocked the Christmas DLC because that's later on in the game so once I get to that I'll talk about that.
2220942	2224931	At least hopefully that has the potential to be a little bit funnier than this last one.
2225365	2253453	alrighty getting into my gaming week talking about some games I've played before and I've talked about before more Final Fantasy 14 loving the new patch being able to level up an alternate job class much better than just fate partying to death so that's amazing I love it and thank you to generous listeners by the way I know some folks have mentioned Codeman got them games Codeman got me a game too X-Link was kind enough to get me a game too so I just want to
2254173	2255413	Thank the listeners, General.
2255433	2256433	You guys really don't have to.
2256453	2256813	Thank you so much.
2256833	2260114	Speaking of generous listener, did you see in chat what DarkTetsuya said?
2260554	2263055	DarkTetsuya says, Rob, if you want it, you can have my Steam.
2263135	2263575	Oh, my God.
2263595	2263955	What a nice.
2264135	2264355	Yes.
2264435	2265775	Yes, I want it.
2265815	2266295	Thank you.
2266435	2267135	That's amazing.
2267255	2267835	Thank you so much.
2269096	2272316	I can pay you in doggy coins.
2272836	2273876	Or is it Doge?
2273996	2274316	I don't know.
2274356	2275657	How do you say the D-O-G-E?
2276057	2277117	Is it just dog coins?
2277537	2278597	I say doggy.
2278837	2279137	It's dog.
2279377	2279617	Okay.
2280698	2281698	I have not gotten it.
2281738	2281978	Okay.
2281998	2282678	Tangent Train.
2282698	2283258	Choo, choo, choo.
2283738	2284438	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2300183	2302564	Wow, such, such impress.
2302844	2303544	Many excite.
2303584	2303844	Wow.
2304224	2304964	You know, that whole thing.
2305124	2307665	And, and, uh, so I, I just started going link, link, link.
2307685	2312085	And I read all this stuff on it and suddenly I'm like mining coins and getting all this stuff.
2312165	2314426	So I, I have doggy coins.
2314586	2318587	So I can pay you, I can pay you, uh, for La Milana and doggy coins.
2318627	2320487	If you want dark to see it, just get a wallet for it.
2321067	2323048	So, um, anyway, sorry.
2323088	2329269	That was like a totally random tangent, but that was taking up like that was insomnia night, much insomnia, such clicking links.
2329349	2329589	Wow.
2330549	2331170	I call it Dog.
2331670	2331990	Dog?
2332591	2333191	Yeah.
2333251	2333852	Doggy.
2334272	2335673	Is there a correct way to pronounce it?
2335693	2336333	That's what I want to know.
2336393	2338895	My understanding of it is that it's born out of Homestar Runner.
2339575	2341076	Is it?
2341136	2350963	And I don't know why letters were, why like the word, the spelling D-O-G-E was introduced, but Homestar Runner was making fun of people calling each other Dog.
2351443	2358388	So he kind of drawed out Dog and spelled it D-O-G-E, presumably like an animation caption.
2358708	2359889	I need to go see the episode.
2360389	2364992	Just to read the things going through from several people.
2366792	2370454	Doug Lounge Radio, such audio, many commentary, very podcast.
2370714	2373616	Such audio, many commentary, very podcast.
2374822	2377424	BuzzFeed put a bunch of those up, by the way, about different political things.
2377444	2379265	Well, BuzzFeed likes to jack everything.
2379325	2381406	Yeah, but I laughed my ass off.
2381426	2382806	There's a great Tumblr.
2383467	2385168	It's BuzzFeed without GIFs.
2386228	2390290	So it's just the writing.
2390610	2392571	So you can see how fucking awful it is.
2392912	2393872	Anyway, sorry.
2394232	2395313	Total train derailment.
2395333	2396173	Let's go back to my games.
2396213	2396493	Choo-choo.
2398004	2399364	BlackWolf made a one-off comment on it.
2420430	2447898	while we were playing Final Fantasy XIV because he won't admit it y'all but Bobby Blackwolf got addicted to Final Fantasy XIV in the past week and has had my help in clearing some of the early game stuff but he brought up Minecraft randomly and I was like I'm gonna go play Minecraft on 360 which had been the first time I touched it in a long time and then that exact same day they released Minecraft for the PlayStation 3 and so I was like I kinda wanna get it but like Rob you couldn't even finish your house in Minecraft PC why would you get Minecraft PlayStation 3?
2449053	2451594	I don't know, I just, I have to have it.
2451914	2454796	Loki, did you see Minecraft on PS3?
2455776	2463980	I didn't really, because I was going to buy it, but then they basically said it's exactly the same as the Xbox 360 one, so I was like, eh, I don't really need it.
2464300	2464780	Interesting.
2464980	2466401	I don't know, I might... Like if it was...
2466946	2467507	XBOX ONE XBOX ONE
2488112	2489633	Other than Minecraft Portable?
2489853	2490974	iPhone, iPod, all that?
2491014	2491854	Oh, I forgot that existed.
2491894	2492795	Okay, never mind.
2492895	2503822	Well, it would be the first tactile, and for as many buttons as that game has the potential of using and whatnot, Vita would be a good potential.
2504262	2507944	Vita, it would be a lot of fun on the Vita, so I'm looking... I mean, I know that's something they're making.
2507964	2511647	Technically, it's supposed to have controller support.
2511767	2512967	I mean, the portable version.
2513007	2515129	I mean, they had a version with controller support
2515609	2518551	for the Sony Ericsson Play.
2520932	2523994	Because everybody's going to be playing it on that.
2524655	2524915	All right.
2524995	2528717	Anyway, let me get to the game I really wanted to talk about because that was all a bunch of old stuff.
2528757	2533320	Let me talk about the new game this week and a lot of people talking about this game and I've been playing an awful lot of this game as well.
2534361	2542866	So we're going to talk about Nintendo Direct in a little bit and some of the stuff that they announced this week because Nintendo kind of was the big newsmaker this week because they actually did a direct with some new news.
2543426	2551732	and one of the games that they teased during this Nintendo Direct was this surprise NES Remix.
2552312	2559377	A brand new game that they put out on the eShop for $15 and of course the minute I saw the trailer I was like...
2560237	2564122	Such retro games, many pixels, wow And I bought it, right?
2564142	2578139	So I had to just go immediately to the store and buy it Because, you know, it tickled my retro bone And I love, that sounds kind of dirty actually But, you know, I just love those retro games and collections So I went immediately to the shop and bought it Did you have a retro boner?
2578919	2606248	I might have a little bit actually so you know it was it was it was a very Beyonce thing because they get it said it's on the eShop right now which was really spectacular when you consider that they went to the VGX thing the week before and decided to talk about nothing about it nothing about it was like we got Cranky Kong and that's all I'm gonna tell you Jeff Keighley and they do they do an Nintendo Direct days later with like actual news fantastic didn't
2606288	2608129	Don't we say that was exactly what was going to happen, though?
2608189	2613132	That they were going to give another outlet nothing and still rely on their own outlets for doing this?
2613712	2617835	I don't know if we really had said that, but I was kind of surprised.
2618115	2620576	I mean, one week, Jason.
2620696	2621737	It was one week later.
2621877	2626039	They knew all this other stuff, and they purposely held onto it for their own direct for whatever reason.
2626059	2630722	They have a captive audience, and they're going to make that their point.
2630962	2631162	Yeah.
2631763	2632263	So, okay.
2632443	2636226	I want to talk about NES Remix, though, because I bought the game, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen this.
2636326	2651577	Many people have been comparing it to WarioWare, which... It's kind of an iffy comparison to me, because WarioWare is very fast-paced, and the 8-bit levels and things like that were very... You know, it was like, push button, dodge.
2651838	2655460	You know, it was like one quick little thing, because that's how WarioWare was.
2655701	2659123	Whereas NES Remix is more little bite-sized samples.
2659663	2660004	It's like...
2660524	2664011	It's like the Halloween bag full of the mini Snickers bars.
2664411	2665553	It's fun-sized.
2665614	2667898	Yes, it's like one of those fun-sized Halloween bags.
2667938	2672306	They're not micro games, but it's just enough of a taste of some of the retro games, right?
2673135	2675737	I have never put one of those things in my mouth and said, wow, I'm having fun.
2675918	2688428	But here's the problem with NES Remix that I have, is that because it's a bag of all the little mini candies, unfortunately, some of the games they included are like the Hershey's Dark Chocolates, where it's like, I don't want that shit.
2688508	2689969	Hey, those are the best.
2690029	2691671	Well, they're all yours.
2692551	2697615	If you enjoy Golf, Wrecking Crew, Urban Champion...
2698499	2700582	Those little candy bars are all you, girl.
2701503	2701923	Enjoy.
2702344	2707330	But I'm going to guess there's probably not a lot of fans out there of some of the games that they included in the collection.
2707370	2708331	Which, alright, alright, alright.
2708872	2714959	I mean, that's the one thing that kind of... You know, because you start with, I think, six games.
2715800	2742038	and then you unlock others and some of them you go oh yay I got Legend of Zelda yay yay that's a great one and then it's like oh I got golf well I won't be playing that one I mean really who likes NES golf anymore you know there's a million better golf simulations out there now maybe at the time it was a fun game for you know golf fans but now it's painful to go back and play I think is part of the issue so
2744358	2748260	And you're playing little portions of these games.
2748340	2756085	So maybe it's like, get from point A to B. And it's like... Loki, you all right over there?
2756945	2757145	Easy.
2757766	2758346	All right, I don't know.
2758786	2761448	Maybe they... I'm hoping they found his sister or whatever that was.
2761468	2764450	All right, anyway, so... That was the GPS bell.
2764770	2765430	Oh, we found her.
2766251	2767772	Many rings, such distracting.
2768972	2769413	So you...
2770473	2771354	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2790245	2791746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2812415	2814636	Fuck I hate the physics in this game, right?
2814817	2818059	And that's kind of enough to remind you of the game and that's good enough.
2818179	2820520	So there's that to get out of it.
2821000	2824082	The remix stages, some of them are actually really cool.
2824643	2831487	Like there's one where you play Super Luigi Brothers or whatever where you run World 1, 2 and it's backwards.
2832447	2837490	And some stages where the camera will consistently zoom in on your character or zoom out.
2837991	2840993	Mario Brothers, like original Mario Brothers levels that scroll.
2841833	2846317	Even though the original Mario Brothers, not Super Mario Brothers, but the original Mario Brothers was a static screen.
2846657	2847758	So they do some neat things.
2848799	2855184	And in playing those levels, I really realized, like, wow, Virtual Console really pisses me off.
2856926	2860249	Because you see them doing all these neat little things...
2861483	2862544	Super Mario Bros.
2862604	2863365	Super Mario Bros.
2863405	2863966	Super Mario Bros.
2876616	2882219	It's basically the same kind of changes from Mario 1, 2, and 3 NES to Super Mario All-Stars 1, 2, and 3.
2883000	2883760	I'm going to be honest.
2883780	2885281	More functional maybe, but similar.
2885561	2891705	The more I played NES Remix, the more frustrated I got with just everything.
2893626	2897368	And I know that's going to sound like the weirdest review in the world, but I'm just being honest, you guys.
2898608	2904592	As a gamer fan, as a retro game fan, the longer I played NES Remix, the more angry I got at Nintendo.
2907742	2926457	And part of it was that all the games that are included in NES Remix are just games that are available on the eShop So the whole thing is just, you know, in some ways ads for the games that are on Virtual Console Yeah, did you like the part where you can actually link to the part in the eShop where you can purchase all those games?
2926538	2931902	Yes, because it's so adorable because you hit the button and a little Zelda screen that comes up and says, buy something, will ya?
2932262	2933023	Oh, that's so cute
2934810	2956580	but it's not to buy like extra levels in NES Remix it's to take you to the eShop to buy the virtual console games I don't know NES Remix left me feeling very conflicted I liked a lot of the things they tried to do with it but as the game went on my my patience for some of the NES classics using the term loosely in the Hershey's dark chocolate games if you will
2957080	2958881	were starting to wear thin on me a little bit.
2959362	2960843	And I don't know.
2960963	2963985	I only am playing it now to see what the different remix levels are.
2964365	2972831	But when I unlock a remix level that's like, play golf and get a hole-in-two in the rain, I'm like, go fuck yourself.
2973052	2974292	I don't feel like playing that.
2974553	2976814	Luckily, you can skip stages and stuff, but I don't know.
2977375	2984259	I thought when I originally saw the headline for that, I was like, oh, look, they're doing a legitimate version of Super Mario Bros.
2984319	2984960	Crossover.
2985714	3012387	But then it was, you know, like WarioWare But I don't know, it's a little more than WarioWare to me Because WarioWare, again, is hitting one button or doing one thing The NES Remix is more bite-sized chunks But it kind of serves as a big advertisement for virtual console, I don't know Go look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Let's see, DarkTetsuya says Does NES Remix do leaderboards or anything?
3013007	3016090	No, but it does have Miiverse integration.
3016451	3022877	And when you see posts from either strangers or your friends, it will show what their time was when they made the post.
3023417	3028122	So I don't know why there's not leaderboards in there because they obviously are tracking the times.
3028242	3033547	But it'd look really terrible if like you bought that game and you're like, hey, I'm going to go buy one of these virtual console games.
3033927	3034108	What?
3034128	3035549	No leaderboard for this game?
3035969	3036310	The hell?
3037769	3054126	BlackWolf says the main thing you need to know is that Retro Game Challenge for DS is awesome and it's the same people that's a very good point it is the same people that made Retro Game Challenge for the DS I would have rather just had that on the Wii U or like a new version of that on the Wii U with like new games or Super Nintendo games or something I would love that
3054787	3056308	So, but that's not what it is.
3056748	3057329	So I don't know.
3057889	3059971	My feedback on NES Remix is mixed.
3060111	3061312	It's truly a mixed review.
3061852	3071559	Like, if you really like retro NES games, and you're willing to stomach some of it, and $15 doesn't seem too high of a price for you, then I say go ahead and go for it.
3071839	3081426	But just realize, when you play it, you're gonna get a little disappointed that you've spent money on other virtual console titles, and yet NES Remix...
3081946	3086527	does more in some of its bite-sized chunks that Virtual Console refuses.
3086767	3088008	And I think that's the best word to use.
3088088	3090869	Nintendo refuses to do with Virtual Console.
3091109	3092589	They refuse to innovate it.
3093169	3096010	Because I'm left to believe that it's not that they can't.
3096350	3097270	It's not that they won't.
3097550	3101952	They refuse because NES Remix shows that they can do more with it.
3102412	3107013	Is that any different from any other publishers, consoles, classic game revivals?
3108277	3126043	well sure like Capcom Arcade cabinets pretty cool you can do multiplayer online and you can do the replays that save and the top high scores you can look at the little playthroughs and you have the HD graphics filters and that's all pretty cool and that's just the first collection that came off the top of my head
3127214	3153628	I haven't played a revival set in a very long time but I'm thinking back to like PS2 like the Midway arcade classics and all that kind of stuff the various Namco collections but that was on the PlayStation 2 where a lot of this integration isn't exactly possible mostly network based and friends and community and all that kind of stuff modern consoles that do have that information okay I agree that makes sense
3154128	3156969	Jason, you saw me playing NES Remix for a little bit.
3156989	3160171	I know you didn't get to touch it yourself, but certainly you're familiar with the Nintendo Classics.
3160211	3162932	What if you wanted to touch it, Rob?
3163092	3164873	I'll go get the tablet now and he can play.
3165133	3168714	Which, by the way, also interesting to note, tablet does nothing.
3169314	3173056	It's just a second screen, like many of the Wii U games of late.
3173136	3174297	Just an interesting observation.
3174697	3177198	But anyway, Jason, you were watching me play.
3177298	3178698	Any thoughts from watching?
3178718	3180099	I know you didn't get to touch, but just...
3180219	3182039	I live for those kind of games.
3182280	3184880	I was backseat gaming the whole time Rob was playing.
3184920	3186300	It's like, you could have just dodged it.
3187181	3202184	He was playing classic Mario Brothers, you know, with the three layers, and you have to hit the block with an enemy on it to flip the turtle upside down, hit the monkey, red, demon things twice, all that kind of stuff.
3202804	3206045	And I was like, you could have just gone up a level temporarily in order to dodge that fireball.
3206105	3208646	I was backseat gaming the whole freaking time.
3209526	3237793	I live for that kind of game if I had a Wii U I would get that in a heartbeat it was very fun it was very fun looking it looked like it controlled well that is with regard to how the game played originally it was not improved which is kind of a good thing because it was meant to be something specific it was the most prominent parts of all of the games that you played
3238553	3239013	Thanks for watching!
3261498	3266202	I likened it to Dance Master Mode in DDRs since Extreme US.
3266843	3272168	Just subtle little variations on existing content to come up with something brand new.
3272628	3273228	It looked fun.
3274049	3274950	I would not mind playing that.
3275570	3277252	You'd pay $15 for it?
3277272	3280835	That's really hard to say right now.
3281516	3281536	I...
3284053	3285436	I definitely would to try it out.
3286077	3287921	Would I feel like it was still worth it afterwards?
3287961	3288402	I have no idea.
3289003	3289504	I didn't touch it.
3289524	3290005	I just watched.
3290145	3290987	But it looked fun.
3291536	3292236	All right, fair enough.
3293117	3294478	Show where every gamer has a voice.
3294498	3296199	What do you guys think about NES Remix?
3296239	3300881	Tell us in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, or if you've played the game, maybe you disagree with some of the things I've said.
3300961	3303723	Maybe you're overwhelmingly positive or overwhelmingly negative.
3303763	3307705	Some of the websites out there ran very negative reviews of the game this week.
3307745	3308426	I'd like to try it.
3308666	3314289	And I want to say again, I'm leaving it with a mixed review because there was elements of what Jason's saying that I like too.
3314549	3318472	And again, I think some of these games are best experienced in bite sizes.
3318492	3318852	Yeah.
3319732	3320733	I don't know.
3320833	3324074	There is some inherent frustration that came from this game as well.
3325174	3326295	It is what it is.
3326375	3326815	Take it or leave it.
3327795	3330156	Anyway, we need to move on with the show and get into some of the other news.
3331157	3332617	Let me talk quickly about housekeeping.
3332917	3334158	We will be here next week.
3334238	3340880	We aren't planning on taking time off for the holidays just because Sundays fall on pretty good days this year where we can do shows uninterrupted.
3340981	3342041	So we will be here next week.
3343421	3345802	Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
3346582	3348823	Also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3349083	3352404	We're on Google Plus as well, google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
3352644	3353664	Even if they're being bastards.
3353724	3354744	Yeah, we'll get into that later.
3356265	3364447	I also want to give a plug for this real quick because I think tomorrow is the last day that you can nominate for, no, I think it's today actually, is the last day you can nominate for the Stitcher Awards.
3364967	3375117	So maybe this won't do anything for our podcast listeners, but for our live listeners, would love it if you would head on over to the Stitcher website and nominate us for Best Games and Hobbies podcast.
3375578	3376919	Would really, really appreciate that.
3377099	3380863	And your nominations go a long way in helping us get recognized.
3380923	3385808	And remember, we don't, I mean, it's not that like we're sitting here going, we deserve to get all these awards.
3385948	3393893	No, we just realized that as an independently produced show, the exposure that comes with even getting nominated is invaluable.
3393973	3395494	That's more what we're going for.
3395534	3396715	Help us be exposed.
3396995	3399377	Yeah, help us expose ourselves all over the internet.
3399737	3400538	We'd really appreciate that.
3401212	3404733	Alright, and then I know some other VOG shows definitely worthy of nominations.
3404753	3407054	Some of you guys have been nominating Bobby one day and us one day.
3407094	3407514	That's cool.
3407834	3412276	I know Understation Live wants to do Most Original and I think that's perfect for them.
3412336	3412776	It's great.
3412816	3413476	I hope they get that.
3414176	3421459	And certainly there's other TV and entertainment categories where Critical Myth, Pod Culture, British Invaders will all be great choices and so on.
3422439	3423480	Um, there you go.
3423560	3427982	And yes, uh, SSG100 Matt says nominate and give all the VOG shows a nice review on Stitcher.
3428322	3428522	Yes.
3428623	3429703	And thank you, SSG100 Matt.
3429743	3431584	I saw your review on Stitcher this week and thank you.
3431604	3432525	That was, uh, great.
3432845	3435286	So those reviews really, really help.
3435886	3437047	Uh, so I really appreciate it.
3437087	3442010	And thanks to everybody at Stitcher and, uh, everywhere that's listening to podcasts for supporting the show.
3442350	3443150	Really appreciate it.
3443450	3445772	I hope you're having a good time listening and participating with our show.
3446432	3448353	Let's get into some news.
3448693	3449874	Loki's gonna start us off.
3450543	3457609	Okay, so this was kind of unexpected when they were talking about games coming out during the whole Nintendo Direct.
3457909	3459050	It's a new Zelda game.
3459390	3463713	Not exactly the Zelda game you might have been looking forward to, but it's a new one.
3464134	3466996	And it's being dubbed right now Hyrule Warriors.
3467596	3474362	It's basically a spin-off of the Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors series.
3475322	3478905	And it's just like that, but now set in Hyrule.
3478945	3479746	You play Link.
3480725	3495273	and it's got all the different enemies and stuff from you know the series and the same kind of gameplay you expect from like a Dynasty Warrior game so it's supposed to come out sometime in 2014 for the Wii U. What do you think about this?
3496154	3496974	I think it looks neat.
3497335	3506880	I mean I think it would be a little bit more successful if it was compared to like Monster Hunter because some of the screenshots especially where they were
3507369	3511311	They were going up against some of the boss monsters and stuff.
3511711	3514812	It reminded me a little bit of Monster Hunter.
3517073	3518014	I don't know, it looks neat.
3518914	3521035	More than one Zelda game in a year is always good.
3523402	3526464	Yet another thing VGX was snubbed for from Nintendo.
3527544	3528345	We were just talking about it.
3528425	3529786	Yeah, yeah.
3529946	3536169	I think it's interesting that we have another game where Nintendo has allowed a third party one of their big franchises.
3536370	3538711	I mean, granted, it's a spin-off game and not a main game, which...
3539431	3541052	We know Team Ninja and Metroid.
3541612	3543012	Some people liked it, some people didn't.
3543393	3544533	But it was an interesting experiment.
3544553	3547374	So I think it's very interesting that we have Zelda as a big one.
3547794	3555517	And to let Koei Tecmo do a Dynasty Warriors type of game with that is a pretty big deal.
3556817	3564263	So, TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminding us that Hyrule Warriors is the working title.
3564363	3565804	It could have a different title later.
3566585	3566905	Who knows?
3566945	3570028	Maybe they'll give it a Legend of Zelda and a subtitle.
3570048	3577573	Because if you think about it, things like Phantom Hourglass were kind of not really Zelda games, but they were still in kind of that canon.
3577733	3579395	I mean, but they played very differently, so we'll see.
3580915	3586738	SSJ100Matt says, if Nintendo was really smart, they would have other Nintendo characters as unlockables or DLC heroes to play with.
3587098	3589599	Well, I wonder if some of the characters from Dynasty Warriors wouldn't show up.
3590059	3591259	It would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?
3591799	3593700	DarkSakura, I don't know if you've seen a lot about this game.
3593940	3594881	Dan and I talked about it.
3594921	3595741	Yeah, do you have interest in it?
3596181	3596541	Not really.
3597161	3607604	I mean, but we were talking about, you know, Nintendo having this history of doing spinoffs with the Legend of Zelda series and marketing it out.
3607824	3612825	Like, you know, how there were the licenses given for the 3DO and all that in the background.
3612885	3616486	And we were talking about Phantom Hourglass and the Lynx, you know, crossbow training.
3617286	3621807	You know, it's another cash grab, really.
3621827	3621907	Yeah.
3622447	3626592	Well, you remember, this isn't the first time they've done a crossover with Tecmo Koei either.
3626632	3629676	I think they had, was it Romance of the Three Kingdoms with Pokemon?
3630376	3632419	Or it was Nobunaga's Ambition, one of those.
3632579	3633080	That's right.
3633160	3633780	I forgot about that.
3633800	3634161	You're right.
3636111	3657889	Tech2030 in our chatroom says Nintendo Warriors would have been a much better game maybe something a little more inclusive of other characters I don't know I think there's a lot of people that are going to buy it on Zelda alone if I was going to do one I would pick one of the Fire Emblem franchises since you've got more characters to choose from and I believe that the play style is similar but then again they just say oh well it's another you know Fire Emblem game
3658354	3658534	Right.
3659355	3661536	We'll be curious to see what happens with that game.
3661676	3664597	InTech2030 actually mentioned Marth.
3667219	3672101	Alright, well something else that came out of Nintendo Direct, another game announcement, it is Dr. Luigi!
3672261	3674423	Because of course it is the year of Luigi, is it not?
3675283	3679785	So Dr. Luigi will be kind of the last big hurrah for Luigi in the year of Luigi.
3680346	3683827	It will be hitting the Wii U eShop on December 31st.
3684268	3686249	And as you can probably guess, Dr. Luigi...
3687029	3688850	Dr. Mario, but starring Luigi
3705638	3707119	and I'll see you next time.
3732394	3740056	I don't know if you guys remember, but they actually released Dr. Mario on the Wii, and it was almost like the same thing.
3740096	3758380	I mean, it didn't have the Operation L, that's a new thing, but it had the two-player online mode, and I think I remember back then talking about it going, oh, yay, finally a Wii game by Nintendo that's like head-to-head online that's really exciting, and I think most people bought Dr. Mario, played it for a day online against like one friend, and then probably never touched it again.
3759241	3763068	I can't help but wonder if Dr. Luigi is going to meet a similar fate.
3763509	3767116	Granted, if they get their money, they don't care if you play it for one day or 100 days.
3768358	3769701	What do you guys think about Dr. Luigi?
3771730	3776394	I don't have a Wii U, so I'll just come over here and play it.
3776934	3781658	Is that a system seller for you, Dr. Luigi?
3781978	3782178	No.
3783039	3788062	If Dan and I were going to have bought a system, it would be for Wind Waker HD, and we clearly haven't bought one yet.
3790004	3791325	It's not a seller, honestly.
3792165	3795308	If I really, really wanted to play Dr. Mario, I'd hook up my NES.
3796509	3796789	That's it.
3797216	3797536	Fair enough.
3797616	3798717	Jason, any interest in this?
3799737	3802579	I was pretty terrible at Dr. Mario.
3803119	3807121	It's a game and it's continuing a trend of something that Nintendo's been wanting to do topically.
3807682	3808082	It's cute.
3808682	3808922	Cool.
3809703	3810783	Probably wouldn't buy it.
3811144	3813025	I have to say I was really good at Dr. Mario.
3813485	3815566	I'd get up to level 30-something.
3815706	3824951	I seem to remember always fast-forwarding myself to level 15 or level 20 or something like that and always dying incredibly quickly and being very frustrated and not playing the game again.
3825672	3827034	That's why you have to start at the beginning.
3827094	3832759	If you start from the beginning and build up, you acclimatize to the speed.
3833340	3839946	It was one of those things where I didn't want to start from scratch and I wanted to make it actually difficult, but I would always make it too difficult.
3840387	3841808	And I never found that a happy medium.
3842408	3846272	I'm also talking like years and years and years ago, so I really don't remember how it all wound up playing out.
3846593	3846773	But...
3848214	3855562	Eh, maybe if I'm looking for something to pad up a library with, but yeah, no particular interest in jumping on this real quick.
3856223	3858185	Uh, Loki, is this a system seller for you?
3859025	3859846	Oh, totally!
3860587	3864391	No, I mean, seriously, Luigi's a terrible doctor, right?
3864992	3869336	You know, shoving L-shaped pills down someone's throat, it's just a choking hazard.
3872324	3885154	I can't help but feel like games like this and NES Remix were really rushed just to try and beef up Nintendo's offerings on the eShop for better or for worse.
3885234	3887095	I mean, I guess I really can't complain.
3887135	3892319	As much as I might have been a little bit critical of NES Remix earlier, there were good things about it too.
3892659	3898003	And even this, I might see some negative, but I think it's very exciting that we have an online classic game.
3898023	3900405	I mean, everything I've bitched about wanting on Virtual Console...
3900865	3903787	Dr. Luigi does kind of deliver, so I'm excited to see that.
3903887	3910270	So, I mean, if Nintendo were to rush games like this every couple months or whatever, I wouldn't be mad.
3911091	3914092	I'd like to see more of this type of stuff, especially with some of the classics.
3914132	3915533	I think it would be pretty cool.
3916494	3916654	But...
3917375	3918536	I agree with Fifth Dream, by the way.
3919057	3920017	I can't play Dr. Mario.
3920037	3921819	I'm too good at it and games go on for hours.
3922239	3923140	This is true.
3923160	3924641	No, no, no.
3924802	3925222	This is true.
3925282	3929346	If you're good at Dr. Mario, you have to jinx yourself.
3929926	3934090	You cannot start the game and just play through it and be done.
3934210	3935031	It doesn't happen.
3935091	3939414	That's my problem with Civilization V. I'm just too good at it and suddenly it's 4 a.m.
3939454	3939955	in the morning.
3940996	3943758	Rob, I've had a three-hour game session of Dr. Mario.
3946028	3946789	Alright, alright.
3947930	3951332	I'm trying to think of a game recently that I've done something like that with.
3951352	3953174	Do you remember Every Extend Extra Extreme?
3953754	3954715	Yes.
3954775	3956336	I had your copy forever.
3956356	3957758	I'm such a whore for Q Entertainment.
3957778	3962261	Well, they had it on an Xbox 360, and I remember I could play that game.
3962722	3965744	I mean, you just keep creating the explosions, the explosions, and do it on the beats.
3965764	3968126	You can keep that game going for hours as well.
3968166	3976532	I remember when I was super drunk at my birthday and I played Luminous and got to like level 25 while I was super, super drunk and I had to actually kill myself so that I could drink my beer.
3977973	3978414	That was fun.
3980055	3982117	Blackwolf in our chat room says, humble brag.
3984879	3987300	I apparently am better at puzzle games when I'm really drunk, by the way.
3988221	3989482	It gets you in a state of zen.
3990663	3992745	I was in a state of I'm on my eighth beverage.
3992785	3995827	Well, DarkSakura, I know you're sober, but maybe you can read the next story for us anyway.
3996337	3997278	Yeah, maybe I could do that.
3998419	4013216	So, there is, for all the people who are super hyper, pissed off at YouTube, like just about everybody, there is a wiki set up so that you can find...
4014557	4022543	Basically, what's going to let you do a Let's Play and monetize it, maybe, and it does not allow.
4023143	4027046	So it's a wiki page called Who Let's Play.
4028127	4030148	And you can go check out the information there.
4031509	4034791	There is a quote saying that right now the issue is with music and developers.
4037134	4052710	are basically have licensed music non-exclusively so that means you might be able to show a game and the game developer will be fine with it but the person who created the music has licensed it out to multiple people and not be so cool with it.
4055013	4061260	But the wiki page is useful out there for, you know, knowing what you can and can't do.
4061480	4062721	If in doubt, you can check.
4063462	4074134	And there's a second wiki that's for, and it says in quotes, known bad actors who are basically...
4075715	4079357	I guess it says something about music resellers, so I'm not really sure about that.
4079377	4086902	It's basically labeling out who you can trust, who you can't trust, and what you're going to be able to do as far as that content.
4088118	4092720	Just to clarify though, it will not stop YouTube necessarily from holding up your videos.
4093000	4094681	And the reason why I point that out... They're dicks.
4095601	4096162	Well, yes.
4096622	4104706	And I know Loki's going to explain a little more to what's going on in a minute here, but just what's going on with me personally right now on my own channel, my video, my struggle.
4105646	4109188	is that the other day I posted a video playing Final Fantasy XIV.
4109208	4110648	I don't even remember what we were doing in it.
4110708	4113169	Oh yeah, it was the last night of the 2.0 patch.
4113570	4114810	So we were just running around talking.
4114830	4116191	It was almost like a little mini podcast.
4116231	4116851	It was a lot of fun.
4117611	4119792	And you can check that out on my channel at Rob Roberts Plays.
4119812	4122093	If you're a Final Fantasy XIV fan, we had a lot of fun with that.
4122754	4129377	And YouTube flagged it saying... And it was one of those weird things where it wasn't a copyright claim.
4129617	4131218	It didn't say that somebody had claimed the copyright.
4131258	4131738	It just said...
4132438	4134399	We don't believe that this is your content.
4134739	4137340	You need to prove to us that it's your content if you want to monetize it.
4138060	4147643	Now, I don't have dreams of making thousands of dollars off YouTube videos, but if I could get one of my videos to go viral and maybe pay for some new microphones for OLR, that would be awesome.
4148883	4149924	That's my deal with it.
4150364	4159147	So I was a little pissed off to see that YouTube flagged the video for literally no reason than they want me to prove I own it.
4159807	4161829	Well, the game was Final Fantasy XIV.
4162309	4174560	I believe that's listed on this wiki, or if it's not, it should be, because on Square's website, it says you can post this on our partner's site, which includes YouTube, and you can make the monetization, because it was a huge deal.
4174700	4178143	At first, they said no monetization, and they reversed their policy.
4178163	4181546	That was a big deal a few months ago when the game first came out.
4182126	4186408	So it kind of pissed me off that YouTube flagged it for literally no reason.
4186548	4193732	And now the views that I am getting, which of course I'm going to get the most views before the patch is out, I didn't get monetization on.
4194608	4197771	No, alright, so maybe I lost a quarter, but it's the principle of the thing.
4197891	4201114	And I'm a small time channel, but what about the big time channels that this happened with?
4201655	4207320	So that's just, I'm just saying, even though this wiki is out there, it's not going to stop this crap from happening.
4207780	4211704	Anyway, let me let Loki, because I know Loki has some more things to elaborate on this with.
4211724	4216148	I was just going to say, though, it's good that someone's taking the time to at least put the information out there.
4216661	4217562	Oh yeah, absolutely.
4217722	4225946	I mean, it's good to know where people stand and to be able to easily educate yourself before you get into the Let's Play business.
4226146	4228307	And that it's a wiki, people can update it too.
4228347	4230048	So it is the community.
4231629	4233670	Loki.
4234310	4243695	YouTube, of course, making a comment regarding this whole fiasco, I guess, and pretty much just sticking by their content ID system.
4244135	4244195	And
4244485	4246709	And they had helpful tips, of course, that's great.
4247210	4254402	So they basically said, last week we expanded the system to scan more channels, including those affiliated with multi-channel networks.
4255469	4262232	As a result, some channels, including many gaming channels, saw claims appear against their videos from audio or video copyright holders.
4262632	4269836	Keep in mind, one video may contain multiple copyrighted works, and any of which can potentially result in a claim.
4270376	4274858	Online rights are often resold to companies like music labels and aggregators.
4275438	4279960	While you might not recognize the owner, this doesn't necessarily mean their claim is invalid.
4280951	4283412	and know that we love what you do.
4283552	4292797	We've worked hard to design the content ID and other tools to give everyone from individual creators to media companies the opportunity to make great videos and money.
4295918	4308344	Yeah, that didn't really help except for the fact that it's monetizing people's videos that really fall under fair use and this is the whole thing where you're having a robot do a human's job and
4309605	4310446	Yeah, it's a big old mess.
4311066	4321593	But to kind of help along with that, there is a brand new non-profit resource that's kind of based off that whole Who Let's Play.
4322614	4332480	And what they're doing is allowing, I guess, some support for people that may have been flagged by the content ID system.
4333141	4336543	And their brand new website knows the website will have some legal...
4336932	4345615	or standard legal language that will be available to everyone to use and educate them on these legal minefields in a simple and clear way.
4346415	4358880	We also like to create some badges much like Creative Commons does that go along with the licensed materials which developers can use to advertise on what legal grounds they stand on advertising that their music is safe to use.
4358900	4364982	So basically just kind of going along the lines of that Who Let's Play wiki resource
4366108	4386028	but expanding it from not just game content but to music resources and stuff like that because there were some people that were actually getting their videos flagged because they had purchased music libraries and they were using some of this music that they licensed in their videos and now those are being flagged by the original...
4386559	4387920	Music Owner and stuff like that.
4388240	4397408	Now, am I correct in thinking that because it says it has online legal resources and language, they'll have templates that I can actually use in contesting my videos?
4397988	4398549	Yeah, I think so.
4398589	4398909	Nice.
4399970	4412119	So next time we get an episode of Orange Lounge Radio flagged as we don't believe you own this content, I can paste language in there that will get that turned over as opposed to denied, which happened this past week.
4412520	4414982	Told by YouTube, we do not own the show.
4416010	4416611	Yeah, pretty much.
4418072	4418332	Anyway.
4420013	4430481	Alright, and then last but not least, there was also this issue with some of the music from Terry Kavanaugh's VVV.
4431081	4443190	It was being claimed by some company called TuneCore, and the whole situation with that, I guess, is that TuneCore, as well as InMusic, they are...
4444622	4469307	partnered, I guess, he maybe had his music going through InMusic and what TuneCore has done is actually helped with the monetization and getting these videos that have their music monetized if it's not the original artists and stuff and also getting them onto different platforms including iTunes and stuff like that.
4469727	4473628	The problem is though, they're I guess going to only whitelist
4475161	4494752	I guess now they're going to only whitelist those tracks for the original author, but for example, if the creator of VVV wants to allow other people use their gameplay footage in Let's Play videos and stuff, they're not going to authorize, or TuneCore's not going to authorize them
4495131	4502673	To make money off those videos, they're basically going to collect all the money from it and give only a portion of it to the original copyright owner.
4503293	4505534	So it's kind of a mess there as well.
4505554	4508615	So why on earth would I want to sign up for this TuneCore thing in the first place?
4509555	4509955	I don't know.
4511535	4512315	What's the benefit?
4512376	4514696	Why did the VVV guy sign up with this in the first place?
4514796	4517757	Maybe he thought he was going to get protected and instead...
4519183	4535362	I think it was more of like just maybe to get the soundtracks up on different, you know, music, you know, networks out there and, you know, iTunes and, you know, wherever else that's being played through and maybe get monetization from that.
4535602	4538566	But he probably never thought that it would come back to bite him on YouTube.
4540543	4553955	The role of a publisher in this scenario, exactly like Loki just said, is that you turn your materials into one source and they go quite literally everywhere, still offering you the control of where you actually want them to be.
4554496	4559100	Amazon MP3, iTunes, Spotify, Rdio, Pandora, CD Baby, etc.
4559471	4559871	Thank you.
4560192	4560772	I get it now.
4561072	4562953	Bobby's clarifying in chat as well.
4563013	4565535	TuneCore gets you on Spotify, iTunes, etc.
4565835	4567957	They're one of the easier music distribution companies.
4568097	4568377	I see.
4568417	4568597	I get it.
4568617	4578904	There was an artist friend of mine that lives near back home showed me some of the analytics that they get and it's really impressive.
4578924	4588551	They have a per network breakdown of where they've been making money so much so that not only is there iTunes revenue but there's iTunes match revenue which is
4589291	4589692	and so on.
4609460	4620908	I understand the benefit, and until... It's so hard as an individual to work with every single one of those outlets, so I understand the middleman in this particular scenario for now.
4621628	4638780	Things might change if services actually get to a point where they give the individual artist or group, what have you, more thorough control easier, or if people just want to do it all individually so they own all the terms and do not have these conflicts.
4639520	4642121	People are going to start learning and that might be something that has to happen now.
4642241	4650024	And it's only easier every single day to put your music somewhere on your own, to put your music on a network somewhere on your own.
4650784	4652745	That said, these services exist for a reason.
4653025	4658307	They solve a lot of problems for people that are out there to get their name out there and reap the benefit of it.
4659699	4665801	Well, all I know is that this YouTube stuff is growing thin on the community as a whole real quick.
4665841	4671604	And I know there's some people out there that are like, well, people are going to just keep going to YouTube because it's the only place for it.
4671664	4681847	But when some competitors start coming out and start doing it better, I'm sure somebody at Twitch TV is thinking right now, how can we turn this into a situation that's better for ourselves and our market share?
4682488	4682588	Yeah.
4683508	4689954	If you don't think people will abandon ship en masse when something better comes along, Myspace would like to welcome you back.
4690074	4690474	Please.
4691716	4693077	Justin Timberlake owns us now.
4693157	4693557	Please.
4693777	4694298	Come on back.
4694438	4694938	Myspace.
4694978	4695439	We're cool.
4695719	4699803	I do very easily think that people will go somewhere better.
4700143	4704727	But as far as YouTube going away is not going to happen.
4704747	4706168	Well, Myspace didn't go away.
4708650	4709390	That's up for debate.
4709430	4710730	Friendster's still around.
4711330	4712011	Is that actually the case?
4712031	4713271	Yes, I think.
4714351	4715312	It's big in Asia, I think.
4715572	4716852	And then Orkut's big in Brazil.
4719433	4720833	Will a better network exist?
4721473	4722394	Yes, absolutely.
4723854	4727215	But the benefit of YouTube is that millions of eyeballs are there.
4727847	4733191	Well, and plus, for better or worse, YouTube has, at least if nothing else, all the archive stuff.
4733551	4734431	They've got so much stuff on there.
4734692	4742097	But I think as far as gamers moving, I think the gaming community may absolutely move somewhere else, especially if a targeted gaming YouTube comes out.
4742137	4744158	But then the question is, who would advertise on it?
4744198	4748041	Because keep in mind, that's what this is all about, is advertiser and who you see advertiser dollars.
4748061	4750142	Every single one of the publishers.
4750282	4753344	If Twitch TV can exist, a gaming YouTube can exist as well.
4753364	4753845	Absolutely.
4754585	4784212	I absolutely agree with that aspect things somebody can make can build a better service and they will if PornTube exists well the other thing too is I'm surprised that a company like TuneCore or InMusic or whatever doesn't have a way I'm sure they did it on purpose but doesn't have a way to say okay I don't want you to worry about monetizing music on YouTube I only want it on iTunes and wherever Stitcher or wherever it's going
4785207	4788729	You know, so if, you know, they could somehow get around it that way.
4788769	4795714	But of course, now that they know that they can make money off of, you know, you know, flagging these things, of course, now they're not going to have that loophole in there.
4797135	4799576	And TuneCore wants to make their money too, right?
4800076	4800397	Oh, yeah.
4800457	4801237	This is how they do it.
4803638	4809002	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase SHADOW.
4809847	4810767	Alright, let's move on.
4811068	4813649	I'm sure lots of other thoughts on this.
4813709	4816410	We might get some emails on it in the next week, but for now, let's move on with the show.
4816990	4817290	Jason?
4817830	4822512	This is not the classic game of the week, but think back to 1993 with me.
4824704	4848847	DOS was the preeminent IBM operating system Windows 95 was still being built I guess early days of AOL My 386 SX-16 was the bomb We still had these things called floppy disks Because nuts to optical media Calling into BBSs to play The Pit So was I And don't copy that floppy
4851243	4855866	and a wonderful little game from LucasArts called X-Wing was released.
4856566	4870555	The first in a series of three games that pretty much set the standard for space dogfights and bolstered by Wing Commander and plenty of other games at the time.
4871903	4880485	If you miss those days, like I do, 2014 is going to be an amazing year because of the announcement of Star Wars Attack Squadrons.
4882585	4893168	Area 52, in conjunction with Disney and LucasArts, are going to publish an up to 16-person multiplayer space battles game under the name Star Wars Attack Squadrons.
4894308	4899913	Please, please, please go to StarWars.com slash AttackSquadrons and sign up for the beta now.
4900234	4904498	Because this game is going to be out in, they're saying currently, the first half of next year.
4904898	4906459	It is going to be amazing.
4907100	4919291	Even though Star Wars Old Republic got its space flight off rails and actually starting battles, there is room for a dedicated game of this caliber.
4920791	4921352	I can't wait.
4921652	4923194	I have nothing else.
4923634	4924876	I have plenty of other things to say.
4925156	4926718	Oculus Rift would make this amazing.
4926938	4928620	I need to go get a flight stick joystick.
4929141	4932004	This game is going to be outstanding.
4932685	4938452	Considering that it is actually going to have... The only games confirmed... Sorry, the only ships confirmed right now are the X-Wing...
4938852	4960827	and the TIE Fighter, but invariably they are going to build that out so that the Rebels have X, A, Y, and B wings, possibly also the Z-95 Headhunter from X-Wing and TIE Fighter, X-Wing versus TIE Fighter and all that, and then invariably the Imperial side will have at least the TIE Fighter, TIE Interceptor, TIE Bomber, and we'll see what else they come up with.
4961868	4962629	I can't wait.
4963389	4963769	Period.
4964870	4965631	You're very excited.
4966952	4972278	Tie Fighter, X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter is like... I played so many games as a kid.
4973819	4974480	Mostly demos.
4974560	4979285	But Tie Fighter was that game that I got through on my own.
4980086	4983149	And maybe cheated a little bit because the cheat codes were right in the menu.
4983209	4986672	And that game was fucking impossible if you didn't have invulnerability and infinite missiles.
4986712	4987313	But anyways...
4988494	4990175	I had so much fun with that game.
4990636	4996780	And then they released the CD-ROM version and they had the four bonus campaign missions.
4996980	4999362	Everything that was built about that game had the right look.
5001683	5003324	I am so happy to see this news again.
5004685	5006226	People have wanted a game like this for a while.
5006306	5008248	LucasArts closing down didn't do any favors.
5009789	5014652	Old Republic, I don't want to be attached to an MMO just to dogfight in space.
5015352	5015933	This is good news.
5016053	5017574	I cannot wait to see what happens with it.
5018804	5022266	Bochikawa on chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Wow, fun stuff.
5022346	5023847	So glad they're revisiting this.
5024587	5029030	Dungeon Buster says, I didn't care much for X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter though because it didn't have a single player campaign.
5029150	5029350	What?
5030170	5030530	It did.
5030851	5033772	It had a single player campaign.
5033812	5034533	It had a story.
5034593	5041776	You had to examine ships and take out defense platforms and escort the Emperor.
5041836	5043597	There was very much a campaign.
5044458	5044718	Okay.
5045698	5064806	alright well I hope these renaissance type games do well and lead way to other things I wasn't super into the Star Wars games I know some people were well I like Super Star Wars on Super Nintendo that was the Star Wars game I enjoyed but I did love the old Wing Commander games like Wing Commander 1 and 2 good stuff
5065146	5085818	I don't think I ever actually owned Wing Commander, which is why it's not as prominent in my brain I played at least 3 and 4 possibly 1 or 2, I don't remember but there has been nothing like those games in over a decade now, so this is just straight up good news Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5087214	5087814	I've got some stuff.
5088574	5089335	How about Hearthstone?
5090395	5093876	People have been looking forward to it, and Blizzard has been kind of pimping it.
5094036	5102858	However, the open beta has been delayed, and it looks like it's going to be done next month.
5103458	5104638	So they're holding it off.
5104778	5109820	It sounds like they're doing some more testing before they do it, and they said they don't want to rush it.
5109980	5110680	Don't want to rush it.
5111400	5112421	Make it slower.
5113302	5121752	But they did say that the invites for the closed beta have already gone out.
5122092	5127318	And if you don't have it, check your spam folder for those who signed up for it.
5129375	5150678	which by the way it's about freaking time this open beta gets here I mean I realize it's been delayed again so I mean but Hearthstone is is it's a beta I don't know why it's still in beta the game is fully functional I mean yes there's still some balance issues to be worked out but like the longer it goes on the more I stop caring about this game because it's like
5151779	5154601	I don't need to see another freaking beta key giveaway.
5154921	5158303	Who is not in this game now that doesn't want to be in it?
5158343	5159504	It's like a Google product.
5160085	5161686	You're really still not in the beta and you want it?
5163367	5163707	I don't know.
5163747	5167670	I've never quite liked card games, but it looks fun and I would not mind.
5168551	5172834	I'm sure somebody in chat has an extra key or I think Grandpa from Horde House has one.
5172874	5173295	We can get you.
5173515	5176677	Also, they're saying opt-ins for the closed beta end on January 7th.
5178138	5203253	you can opt in on Battle.net because they need to just take the freaking game live already it's a little ridiculous I don't know it's like that again it's like Google product that stays in beta forever and it's like past the joke you know Tech2030 in chat asking Hearthstone is going to be free to play right yes if you want to buy new decks though that's where they get the money is from the decks and so forth
5204642	5222869	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates Although I think this will probably be a pretty quick segment, being what week it is But let's check in anyway, Loki You get a whole bunch of coal Because there's nothing Nothing, is there anything coming out right after the holidays?
5222949	5232252	Do we have any big, because I remember last year, we got some pretty big stuff right after the holidays Like Ni No Kuni was just like two weeks after the holidays Is there anything in 2014 looking like that?
5232968	5243955	Honestly, the next thing in 2014 is going to be January 10th, and that's just the disc release of We Fit You, and that's it.
5245035	5248117	The new stuff doesn't come until literally the last week of January.
5248410	5250652	So it's going to be a whole lot of nothing for a few weeks now.
5250792	5253534	You know, if they added a G and an H to that, it'd be We Fight You.
5254855	5255215	All right.
5255676	5260419	Let's travel to Japan where at least there is some news this week because Christmas is very different in Japan.
5261140	5268506	So right after you chat down on some Christmas cake, you can go out on December 26th and check out Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters.
5268546	5270407	They are coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.
5270888	5271628	What can I do for you?
5272809	5275711	They are getting it in Japan a little bit before we are.
5276892	5277333	But I'm...
5277873	5279594	PlayStation 3 is region free, right?
5279674	5281715	So some of you guys might be importing that.
5281735	5282075	I don't know.
5282916	5286177	You can also check out Ampersand or And.
5286358	5286658	I don't know.
5286698	5288979	That's like the title is like an ampersand.
5289019	5295562	And then Sora no Muko de Sakimasu yo ni in regular and limited edition.
5295582	5297463	So cutesy game.
5297703	5300405	Yeah, it looks like, you know, happy.
5300425	5300725	Let's see.
5300765	5302606	But that is the title of the game is like an ampersand.
5302666	5305007	So I don't know if that's like a is that an anime that I don't know of?
5305368	5306068	I don't think so.
5306377	5306837	Thanks for watching!
5324804	5328327	Checking out some of the other consoles on the Xbox 360.
5328867	5329227	Nada.
5329688	5330448	Nothing this week.
5330869	5337333	On the PlayStation Vita, the Ampersand game is there too, as well as the 10 and 10.2 HD remasters are there as well.
5337994	5345099	And there's also, I believe, a special box set with the PlayStation Vita and the 10 and 10.2 all coming together.
5345139	5346439	So that is on the PlayStation Vita.
5346960	5349261	On the Wii U this week, nothing.
5349341	5352364	But there is an accessory for Wii Karaoke U coming out on December 31st.
5353084	5354585	A little mini speaker system.
5356245	5360667	On the 3DS, A Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Worlds makes its way to Japan this week.
5360787	5362228	That was one that we got first.
5362628	5367030	And they are getting that extra little console bundle that we got here as well.
5367050	5368971	In fact, I want to see, does it look the exact same?
5369471	5372012	I'm kind of curious because I actually haven't seen what the Japanese one looks like.
5372433	5375454	Yes, it is the exact same bundle we got here except the box art's way better.
5376674	5377715	I like that box art way better.
5378931	5395408	but it's that same 3DS except of course it is a Japanese 3DS because you know they're region locked and stuff and lastly on the PSP this week Julik Nightmare in regular and limited edition as well as Sengoku Hime 4 comes out this week on the PSP
5396977	5399398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5418593	5426539	I've actually been chatting off and on with CatastrophicMagi and he was telling me not too long ago about playing Strider on the Spectrum.
5426719	5427020	Nice.
5427780	5431283	And I was like, hey Dan, you want to play Strider on the Spectrum?
5431663	5433745	And Dan's like, no.
5435106	5438248	It's one of those things that probably sounds more fun than it really is.
5438288	5439149	You know what I want?
5439329	5440229	Rose-colored retro glasses.
5440249	5446034	What I would love to get for my house is a Duo RX so that we can use an arcade card
5446770	5456517	or have a converter that we can use an arcade card with on our duo because we can't play his version of Strider for the PC Engine without using an arcade card.
5457958	5459179	And of course the pin sets are different.
5459639	5460960	So, anyway.
5463462	5468246	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, Loki.
5469326	5474810	Alright, so of course everyone wants to know what was the most played game in 2013?
5476520	5504512	and Raptor has the answer for that they broke down the top 5 games of course number 1 being my personal favorite Grand Theft Auto 5 followed by Call of Duty Ghosts on Xbox 360 and actually Grand Theft Auto 5 on 360 was number 1 Battlefield 4 on PC Dota 2 on PC and last but not least Final Fantasy 14 Online Realm Reborn on PC
5506377	5508898	Wow, I didn't realize Realm Reborn was that high.
5508938	5515281	But I'm also surprised that World of Warcraft, League of Legends, where are those games?
5515861	5520823	It's actually those most played that was based on a 30-day launch window.
5520843	5522144	So actually the most played...
5522708	5526371	PC Game of 2013 was League of Legends Let's log back into Xbox 360 Voice then
5545407	5548890	Well, the whole thing is just like, you know, like achievements.
5548930	5549510	Yeah, pretty much.
5549570	5551412	You know, it's just kind of like, oh, damn it.
5551532	5553814	You know, Rob's outperforming me in this game.
5553834	5555175	I have to go play this game some more.
5555515	5556556	That's basically it.
5556676	5558197	It's up-to-the-minute EPing.
5558337	5559718	24 hours, 7 days a week EPing.
5559818	5561660	It's cross-network leaderboards.
5562521	5563061	Alright.
5563381	5565203	I have a Raptor account, I'm pretty sure.
5565263	5568426	It probably tracks my 360 progress, but you know.
5569086	5570628	When's the last time you turned that thing on?
5570688	5571849	This week when I played Minecraft.
5571969	5572909	Oh, not so bad.
5572950	5573890	We were talking about that, weren't we?
5573930	5574791	Yeah, weren't you paying attention?
5574991	5575232	Sorry.
5575952	5577894	I was actually taking notes for the video.
5577914	5579115	That's my legal excuse here.
5579415	5580155	Minecraft.
5580335	5581496	Mine all the things.
5582236	5582656	You know what?
5582696	5583816	Okay, I have to say something else funny.
5583856	5584196	Side note.
5585097	5590558	Julian, when I picked him up from school on Friday, he said, Can I play Minecraft at your house?
5591278	5591879	And I said no.
5592379	5593519	Because I've uninstalled it.
5593899	5596560	I remember when you hated Minecraft, but you finally came around.
5596580	5597780	Like, that was some progress in 2013.
5598140	5600161	You finally came around to lukewarm on Minecraft.
5600808	5602569	CallDutyBlackOps2, GrandTheftAuto5
5621107	5622049	and then Minecraft.
5622329	5623432	I thought it was interesting.
5624514	5631707	The fact that Grand Theft Auto 5 could jump up that high in gameplay hours for the last two and a half months of the year compared to everything else
5632831	5635473	Not surprising, but kind of crazy.
5660551	5667097	I don't really know how to condense this into, but if you somehow don't know the controversy with Penny Arcade Expo, let me just put it this way.
5667618	5673744	The guys behind it have a tendency to put their foot in their mouths every time.
5673884	5678729	Just when you think they might have learned something, they stick their foot right back in their mouth with some other comment.
5679369	5684194	So that's really turned some people or rubbed some people the wrong way with Penny Arcade Expo.
5684214	5688538	And there's definitely a call where they need to do the right thing and they need to get the message out there.
5688959	5697067	And they need to be a little more accepting of all types of gaming cultures and so forth.
5697687	5698648	And anyhow...
5699449	5700650	Some plans came out this week.
5700670	5702052	Some leaked plans or whatever.
5702372	5707938	Some leaked information came out this week about Penny Arcade's planned diversity hub and lounge.
5708098	5708779	Oh, God.
5709059	5709339	Hold on.
5709379	5709860	I'm not done.
5710020	5710360	I know.
5710400	5718409	This is going to be something that would be in a high-traffic PAX area that would be a resource for PAX attendees to find information related to issues surrounding women.
5719430	5724675	LGBTQ, people of color, disabled people, mental health issues in gaming.
5725435	5735265	It would be a resource for industry professionals and fans to interface in a setting focused on diversity, receive diversity training, learn more about diversity, and meet people from diverse communities.
5735805	5738308	And, of course, this was all mocked on Twitter in an instance.
5738808	5742692	Hashtag diversity lounge drinks, things of that nature.
5744773	5749235	Basically, some folks kind of saying like, wow, they are literally shoving all of this in the corner.
5751155	5751775	So I don't know.
5751815	5753476	A lot of mixed feedback going on this.
5753776	5758498	And we don't know if this is what PAX will actually end up implementing or whatever.
5758578	5760458	But PAX East is coming up before we know it.
5761419	5763399	I made a decision not to go to PAX East.
5763719	5765800	That's rooted mostly in finance.
5765920	5768681	But there was a small part of that where I was just like, you know what?
5770054	5770954	Pax does a lot of panels.
5770974	5771155	Why not...
5797728	5798429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5821070	5845082	but what about something that builds awareness to maybe one of these causes as a booth that's out there on the show floor you know what about some great gaming charities that could be out there on the show floor really getting their information out there to maybe some of the people that need to hear it most it is a little weird to hear that they want to like kind of put it in its own room I don't know any thoughts on this from you guys here in studio or Loki on phone
5845620	5846521	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5865093	5869336	I don't know if it's too little too late and if they're really going about it the wrong way.
5869476	5872678	I would like to see the public booth.
5872798	5876621	I would like to see something right available at every corner.
5877081	5878302	Here's where you can get your information.
5879503	5889149	The whole thing reminds me of The Office when Michael would try to have a diversity day and stuff and it just goes horribly wrong.
5889169	5891891	They completely offend everybody in the process.
5892651	5893852	It's kind of like that.
5894970	5898700	There's a part of me, I gotta be honest, there's a part of me that's like, you know what, they don't...
5899791	5905053	And maybe this is a controversial thing I'm about to say, so feel free to present your viewpoint respectfully if you think I'm wrong.
5905493	5907454	But I'm just kind of like, you know, there's a part of me that thinks, you know what?
5907754	5909635	They don't really need to even do this.
5910175	5916097	Just don't go out of your way to be all like, yay, we're going to have diversity day and hold hands.
5916498	5923580	How about you apologize for what you said and mean it and just show through your actions in the future?
5923881	5924101	Yeah.
5924561	5925701	That would mean so much more.
5925721	5927362	Because that would be too difficult, Rob.
5929042	5930142	That's the honest thing at the end of the day.
5930242	5931103	I don't need a room.
5931743	5935726	I just need your actions to show that you care.
5938087	5939108	And that's enough for me.
5942290	5945151	But then, if they do this, they don't have to change their behavior.
5946352	5948033	They're making their token effort.
5948093	5949934	And that's what bugs me about it.
5949974	5955136	Now, Ranma wants to remind us in chat at live.vognetwork.com, it was a leaked memo, things might change.
5955156	5956137	That's absolutely right.
5956777	5961059	SSG100Matt says, tinfoil hat time, I wonder if they leaked it on purpose to see the reaction.
5961919	5964040	Queen Simia says, it's tokenism, I think.
5964380	5967502	See, we're not totally sexist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynist.
5967762	5969603	We put a room just for them over there.
5970523	5971684	That's where I'm just like, you know what?
5971744	5977927	Why don't you just show through your actions you're not that way and then just have a gaming convention and we're good.
5978448	5991775	And to be fair, most corporations, especially a lot of the ones that you are going to have on the floor at your convention, have diversity training as part of their corporate training.
5992575	5994056	You know how this goes, right?
5994076	5994796	Oh yeah, absolutely.
5995096	5996857	I've been working, I worked for...
5998138	6022255	what was the money store for like 10 years and we had freaking diversity training damn near every year especially if you're in customer service but yeah it's it's just it's I I'm at a loss because I want to say five different words at one time to describe it and none of them want to come to the fore so I'm just gonna say it's fuckery and leave it at that
6024006	6025826	Jason, any final thoughts on this?
6025846	6027107	I had exactly the same thought.
6027647	6043930	I had exactly the same point as you in that this seems exceedingly unnecessary when it's not born out of... The big story at the last PAX was not this born out of confrontation on the show floor or something between attendees.
6045130	6049571	It was the fucking founder that was making stupid comments.
6049611	6052632	Wasn't it also outside, just on the internet, not even...
6053312	6063897	I don't remember if it happened a day of the show or shortly after or something like that, but it's like, one, he literally pulled a sorry not sorry on stage, basically.
6064597	6067138	Oh, I don't remember that portion of it.
6067178	6072340	That was my impression of it anyway, is that, you know, oh, I said sorry for this once, but I'm really not sorry.
6072400	6073381	I'm sorry I got caught.
6073948	6075329	Yeah, this is, I don't know, anyway.
6076089	6079971	Or my favorite thing, I'm sorry my words offended you.
6080671	6084733	Which means I'm not sorry for what I said, I'm just sorry that you called me on it.
6085054	6087135	Yeah, it's your problem, not mine.
6087735	6089536	It seems foolish, it seems unnecessary.
6089856	6096239	It definitely is putting the problem, quotey fingers, into a corner.
6097119	6097400	Whatever.
6098300	6098821	Yeah, whatever.
6100203	6102365	Alright, let's move on.
6102526	6108393	Let's go to a time when gaming was just... It didn't have all this fuckery, as Jamie put it.
6108453	6110736	It also didn't have all this diversity, but that's another topic.
6111397	6111877	You know what?
6112338	6115682	That's because everybody in video games was Japanese.
6116661	6118202	Thanks for watching!
6137535	6140037	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6160336	6168599	which we got it over here with one of the Namco Museum games as the Genji and Heike clan.
6170060	6173922	And over there it was the Genji and Heike tale of the demon's demise.
6174782	6177883	It's a side-scrolling action game that came out by Namco.
6177983	6183525	It was an arcade game in 1986 and it ran on the Namco System 86 hardware.
6184006	6186287	And like I said, we got it over here as the Namco Museum Vol. 4.
6187608	6189571	or it was The Sea, which I have it.
6189591	6191173	And the game's actually kind of a neat little game.
6192074	6202029	And I like it from an artistic point of view because the game sort of plays like you're on a Yamatoid type landscape.
6202169	6203151	So it looks like
6204719	6212186	Almost like it's trying to emulate some of the ancient artwork of Japan pre the popularity of the woodblock stuff that a lot of people are used to.
6214628	6219092	So, as you go through the game, you have different types of action.
6219112	6220633	You have the small mode, which is standard.
6220773	6223516	Big mode, with large characters and...
6225657	6232682	Big Boss Fights, and then you have a playing mode, which is overhead.
6232882	6241808	You have a torii, which are used to transport you to a different stage, and most stages are featured in the side mode or playing mode.
6242729	6246671	There are multiple torii that can be entered that will take to different routes on the map.
6246751	6249693	In big mode, there's only one, and it's at the end of the stage.
6251114	6265557	So you are playing a historical samurai named Taira no Kagekiyo, which is basically, he died in the battle of Dan no Ura at the end of the Genpei War.
6266277	6272739	And he was resurrected in this to fight Minamoto no Yoshitsune, I've got a lot of Japanese in this,
6273559	6282543	and Saito Musashi Bulbenke over the Imperial Regalia of Japan, which is the only way to beat Minamoto no Yoritomo.
6283604	6299151	So it's got a lot of different elements of Japanese history and mythology in it, including the Sanzu River, which separates the current life from the afterlife, sort of like the river Styx in Greek mythology.
6300251	6309235	and different mythological characters like Emo who or Emadayo who is the king of the god of the underworld and Amaterasu who is the sun goddess.
6309935	6311556	There have been many different versions of it.
6311616	6313077	In 1988 we had the Sharp X68000 home computer.
6317839	6343228	and it was very very much like the arcade version we have a PC Engine version that came out on March 16th 1990 and the PC Engine version has been released on the Wii's Virtual Console as I said earlier it was released in the US on Namco Museum Volume 4 as the Genji and Heike clans which is probably about the closest
6345638	6349242	I'd say translation to the name, but we could have gotten over here.
6350684	6355709	There also was an interactive board game that was based off this that used a Famicom cartridge for play.
6356210	6357491	And it was called... Sounds weird.
6357791	6360094	It was called Genpei Toumaiden Computer Board Game.
6360254	6361255	It came out on October 21st.
6361275	6362316	Is that like the Pac-Man board game?
6362997	6364078	I have no freaking clue.
6364419	6365139	I'd have to find this.
6365159	6366241	I'd really like to see it.
6366821	6375148	There was also a sequel called Genpei Toma Den Kanno Ki that came out April 7, 1992 exclusively for the PC Engine.
6376008	6385696	But it did have an American release that was called Samurai Ghost for TurboGrafx-16 and it is the only one of the games that had been released outside Japan before Namco Museum Vol. 4.
6388518	6391459	Kagekiyo has shown up in other games done by Namco.
6392680	6404565	He was a playable character in the WonderSwan color game Namco Super Wars and in Namco Cross Capcom, which he teamed up with Mitsurugi from the Soul series and Tarosuke from Shadowland.
6405766	6420385	and some of the other characters have appeared in it and our most recent one was of course Tyra has been in Namco High as one of the dateable characters which I'm probably going to play him next.
6421185	6425547	and some of the game music was actually remixed for Ridge Racer 5.
6425687	6426627	Oh, cool.
6426667	6427968	So, there you go.
6429008	6430389	And it's a fun game.
6430569	6432190	I mean, you're watching it right now.
6433190	6434991	And you see the shape of the clouds?
6435631	6441854	That was the biggest thing that indicated that art style to me and then when I went and found it actually confirmed, I was like, yes, I recognize the art style.
6441934	6443874	I gotta be honest, I have never seen this game before.
6444174	6444475	Never.
6444495	6444755	Never.
6445715	6449217	I know it was in some Namco collections, I just do not remember it at all.
6449337	6453940	If you would like at some point, I'm more than happy to bring over the sea from my Namco collection.
6454760	6455520	It's a fun game.
6455580	6456701	It really is fun.
6457441	6459983	I just have a billion other classics I gotta play too.
6460463	6461904	It's a very interesting platformer.
6462044	6467307	A lot of the imagery in this has reminded me of an old arcade game called Sengoku that I played a handful of times.
6467687	6473050	But I think that's just because Japanese classic warrior mythology and not so mythology.
6473790	6496332	And especially with the way that the imagery is presented, the way that you have, even the dialogue is presented in game as corner, top to bottom, left to right, as traditional Japanese artwork would have had a poem or something written on it.
6497212	6500134	Um, very kanji heavy too, I noticed.
6500394	6507679	So, of course, you know, the first one I played was, you know, the English version that came out on PlayStation.
6508439	6509560	So, but it's a good game.
6509780	6510781	It's a really good game.
6511461	6520147	Very solid, and I also just laughed my ass off at any of Tyra's scenes that I've seen on Tumblr so far, so I have to play Tyra's next.
6520899	6521360	Alright, there it is.
6521380	6522342	Your classic game of the week.
6522362	6523243	What was the title one more time?
6524165	6526429	It was... I just closed the window.
6527531	6528011	You don't remember.
6528031	6529093	It was Genpei Tomoden.
6529434	6530215	Genpei Tomoden.
6530255	6530616	There it is.
6530756	6530997	Alright.
6531457	6533281	Your classic game of the week.
6533780	6537863	And that's probably all of the correct pronunciation you're going to get out of me today.
6538504	6542907	Alright, we've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio coming up here on this pre-holiday edition of the show.
6543207	6546490	We've got Rapid Fire News, a special Fugle Question of the Week tonight.
6547370	6549432	Jason will be reading it, we'll get into that a little later.
6550053	6553875	And some news about Xbox One and plenty more when we come back.
6553996	6555397	Loki's still there on the phone, right?
6556838	6557298	Yes, I'm here.
6557378	6559500	I just have to check on you once in a while because I can't look at you.
6560000	6560901	Did they find your sister?
6560921	6561021	Sorry.
6562185	6562525	Not yet.
6563026	6563486	Oh, God.
6564006	6570910	Well, it's not... She was working out in her goat pasture, so who knows?
6571151	6572091	I don't want a goat.
6572451	6572892	No, you don't.
6572912	6573592	Goats are cute.
6573652	6574173	No, you don't.
6574533	6574873	All right.
6575253	6576774	Well, I hope everything's all right with that.
6576834	6584299	So we've got plenty more Loki on the phone and plenty more folks here in studio when we come back right after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6591044	6602571	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, December the 22nd of 2013, with episode number 532 of our show in progress.
6603112	6610456	And just in case we forget to mention it at the end of the show, I just want to wish all y'all happy holidays out there, no matter what it is you celebrate.
6610496	6612658	You might already be done with the holidays, like Jamie is.
6614059	6616960	Not technically done, because I live in an interfaith family.
6616980	6619282	That's true, as many people do in this day and age.
6619762	6629670	But whatever it is you celebrate, Christmas, I'm sure many, many, many of you Festivus, Kwanzaa And the blessed solstice since it just passed Solstice was last night, right?
6629710	6648264	Yep, Yule celebration Whatever it is y'all celebrate, have a good time And I still want a goat And thanks to all of you who have supported us through Here We Are, yet another holiday season together So thank you everybody And trust me, you don't want a goat
6650475	6653297	I do want a goat so we don't have to mow the lawn ever.
6653698	6654318	And they're cute.
6654358	6655118	Look at their eyes.
6655159	6656019	Their eyes are adorable.
6656379	6657720	Hey, that was my thought.
6657820	6660062	Our backyard's pretty overgrown.
6660082	6661383	I'm like, hey, just bring him over.
6661483	6663544	But yeah, it's not that easy.
6664064	6667867	According to the in-laws, if you have one goat, it's fine.
6667927	6670048	They sort of turn into a dog-type pet.
6670349	6672130	But if you have two goats, they turn into assholes.
6672570	6673611	They start plotting against you.
6674150	6676812	She has like six, and I think they had more.
6677152	6680015	So I think it's like six or seven now that she has.
6680115	6680855	It's ridiculous.
6680935	6681636	Goats!
6681776	6682476	They're so cute.
6682496	6684498	But your sister is a veterinarian, right?
6685259	6693925	Well, she does lab work at a vet tech place, but she keeps her goats at a friend of my mom's house.
6694125	6697528	He has farm land, and so she has a pasture over there.
6698526	6699067	That's pretty cool.
6700027	6703689	There's a lot of farming in my family too, believe it or not.
6704410	6711134	My uncle, I don't know how much I should really say about this, but my uncle is a big-time pig farmer.
6711174	6717018	He was actually president of some big pig-related thing when swine flu broke out.
6717218	6721461	So they interviewed him on the news and he was literally there on the... I think I talked about this when swine flu first broke.
6721801	6723582	He was literally the guy there on the news saying...
6724042	6733595	don't call it swine flu and you can eat as much bacon as you want it's fine you know please don't stop buying bacon because you know they're pig farmers so yeah that's that's my uncle
6735476	6738758	All they have to say is that swine flu makes the bacon taste even better.
6740280	6742081	That's the family I grew up in right there.
6743782	6749066	And then I think my other uncle on my mom's side is like a rodeo guy, but I don't even know.
6749186	6750307	We're not super close.
6750487	6755150	When I was a kid and used to go to Dothan, Alabama, and they had a little farm.
6756571	6760894	We actually lived on the farm for like two years, so I spent two summers there, legit.
6761294	6763316	But they had two goats and they were both named Sam.
6764673	6788846	Both of the goats, we're named Sam Some comments in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com Fifth dream, reminding us it's Christmas Eve, Eve, Eve That is something my sister used to say on the 23rd She'd always say, it's Christmas Eve, Eve So today would be Christmas Eve, Eve, Eve Let's see, Redertainment in chat at live.vognetwork.com says Celebrate the holidays, including the new holiday December 20th, the day gay marriage came to Utah
6789246	6816350	congratulations another state on marriage equality that's amazing and as I told you earlier today in the trying to pass a stay on it the court rejected the stay so go get hitched happy to hear it if you're ready for it if you want to don't get hitched just because you can that's like what Britney Spears does however it would be completely fair if you wanted to get really drunk and elope
6816670	6817951	Loki, start us off, rapid fire news
6840083	6843804	Alright, so this week we got another update for Grand Theft Auto Online.
6843864	6847185	They added some capture-to-flag type gameplay modes.
6847905	6849986	Of course, with their own kind of spin to it.
6850106	6853467	They have Raid, which is kind of like a standard capture-to-flag.
6853567	6859388	Then they have bases that you can hold and packages you have to seize and stuff.
6859988	6869491	And then also Contend, which I guess is centered around a single vehicle that you capture and have to bring back to your base.
6870089	6898560	so fun stuff and of course the content creator stuff came out last week as well so been trying to make some stuff with that that was kind of cool Dynasty Warriors 8 Extreme Legends coming to consoles at least Sony consoles in spring 2014 of course Extreme Legends for Playstation 3 and Extreme Legends the Complete Edition for Playstation 4 and Vita
6899882	6901103	All bases covered there.
6902844	6913009	One of the games I forgot to mention that I played this week, a tiny little bit of, of course, just a tiny little bit, I must stress that, Cookie Clicker got a Christmas update.
6913129	6923895	Now there's reindeer cookies that you can click on and a crazy looking Cthulhu-esque Santa and all other
6924858	6927479	and all sorts of power-ups and stuff you can get in there as well.
6927499	6931301	Christmas tree ornaments and all that fun stuff.
6931321	6936064	So check it out if you've left your cookies clicking all by themselves for a while.
6937184	6942967	And the knock-off on the iPhone cookie clicker also has Santa cookies right now.
6943428	6948110	So just saying, with special chocolate milk mode.
6948130	6951132	So if you're playing the cheap knock-off on iPhone, there's something for you there too.
6951272	6951652	Just saying.
6952076	6954457	you have orange juice right now as my milk
6972285	6978487	Alright, moving on to some other topics The game that I kind of thought NES Remix might be more like Super Mario Bros.
6978567	6981407	Crossover But it's not Super Mario Bros.
6981447	6987949	Crossover has a brand new 3.1 version that is out And this brings the Lost Levels into Super Mario Bros.
6987989	6990850	Crossover You know, like the Japanese Super Mario Bros.
6990870	6995751	2 Lost Levels So yeah, now Lost Levels will have 52 levels there with it 348 levels in the game now
6999752	7005735	They did not change the physics, however, for Mario and Luigi, so it's not necessarily the true version, but eh, there you go.
7006456	7008597	Whole lots of new levels there for Super Mario Bros.
7008637	7009037	Crossover 3.1.
7009517	7013699	I haven't played this game in a while, but it was a lot of fun the times I did check it out.
7014019	7015620	And I think, wasn't that developed here locally?
7015640	7016381	Didn't we find that out?
7016521	7017981	Like, the guy who did it's in Sacramento?
7018362	7019122	Yeah, he is.
7019322	7020423	We gotta find him and get him on the show.
7021983	7025865	Also, Konami releasing a new version of Contra, but guess what?
7025945	7026726	It's only in China.
7027466	7028806	Thanks for watching!
7050612	7052153	I was like, oh, hey, PC game?
7052173	7052754	That'd be pretty cool.
7077068	7097883	Maybe coming soon to Steam for $1.99 Speaking of Steam and things you can buy on it Typing of the Dead Overkill is half off on Steam Or at least it was during the holiday sale I don't know if that's still going But there's also a brand new DLC pack You know they've been releasing a lot of these And we keep covering it every week I don't know, this might be the last one But we have to...
7098203	7106688	We have to mention this one because this Trump... They had Shakespeare, they had Football Manager, but this one, this is the best, you guys.
7106888	7109569	It's the filth DLC pack.
7109950	7111510	You can now type lines like...
7120796	7128204	So you can put in those terms into Typing of the Dead Overkill as you blast zombies to cocks.
7128825	7130366	So check that out.
7130606	7133209	That might sell the game for me because I like...
7135171	7135411	Yeah.
7135551	7137373	This means we need... You like cocks?
7137433	7138434	Is that what you're saying?
7138715	7139275	Not really.
7139295	7143419	We need to do another Let's Play with extra for narrating.
7143479	7145121	I think that's going to have to be a thing there.
7145181	7146682	So we'll get that.
7146722	7149205	Maybe instead of Horde House this week, we'll have extra for narrating.
7149225	7151427	This would be a cunning linguist.
7151747	7154069	Yeah, it looks like right now it's only $14.99 and then the DLC is...
7157096	7157597	DarkSakura
7174477	7202094	Skullgirls Encore has a typing of the Skullgirls mode totally inspired by the typing of the dead you will type an on-screen word to do your super attacks if you type it correctly your attack will do 1.5 more damage than usual if right but not perfect it's regular damage and incorrect will have a 10% reduction on the damage it doesn't work online or in tournament mode so typing of Skullgirls
7202894	7210702	Also, for anyone who loves to play old PlayStation games on your mobile, you can now play the original Tomb Raider and it's 99 cents.
7211803	7217268	And it is compatible with iOS 7.0 later only for iOS.
7219110	7223594	You know what, I would only care if I could play the second one where I could make her explode or break her neck.
7224562	7240170	And then, last but not least, and this is really just more good that the video game community is doing, Microsoft has been putting it out there for the Zoo Tycoon community to actually do something to raise money for endangered species.
7240870	7246893	Each month, Microsoft is launching a Zoo Tycoon Community Challenge to help raise money to help these animals.
7247713	7252514	and when the challenge's goal has been reached, Microsoft will donate $10,000 to the chosen non-profit.
7253114	7257995	Players will get updates on how the money is spent with reports from Microsoft.
7258995	7261176	December 31st, this one was released.
7261196	7264436	1,000 rhinos into the wild in Zoo Tycoon and they will donate $10,000.
7264476	7266197	Adopt 1,000 Komodo dragons in Zoo Tycoon and another $10,000.
7266237	7269177	Release 1,000 Sumatran tigers and that's what they are.
7274638	7277500	So hey, you know, they're doing something good.
7278840	7279481	Kudos to them.
7279501	7281322	We like to hear about gamers doing good.
7281342	7282662	We like the fuzzy animals.
7282922	7286284	Gaming companies getting people involved and everything.
7286684	7287805	I like Komodo dragons.
7287985	7288585	Good stuff.
7289225	7290586	Red Entertainment says let's play cocks.
7292407	7293468	He's talking about chickens, of course.
7294148	7299030	All right, let's get into a segment we do here on OLR called the Fugle Question of the Week.
7300391	7301271	Wait, wrong music.
7301392	7301612	Okay.
7303491	7304134	180, pull back.
7304978	7305762	There we go.
7305782	7306284	Question of the week.
7312182	7324255	Alright, every week we ask a question on our Facebook communities, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus community at Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio until they, you know, pull our page because they think it's not really us or something.
7325016	7334505	But anyway, we actually, we flipped the script a little bit this week because it has been a really slow news week and I guess we could have asked about the YouTube, I guess we could have asked about something else, but...
7335166	7335707	You know what?
7335827	7342174	It seemed like a great excuse for us to do another installment of a segment here on OLR we haven't done in an awfully long time.
7342234	7345798	It's a special holiday edition of Ask Orange Lounge.
7348221	7349322	For real this time.
7351440	7352721	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
7353261	7354421	Some stupid question.
7354901	7356442	Well, will we find out this week?
7356562	7365486	On Orange Lounge Radio, we pulled Facebook and Google, and thank God we're still on Google, but we might not be much longer if they keep up this fuckery.
7367106	7368849	It timed well.
7369009	7374197	I should, honest to God, be on Whose Line Is It Anyway because I make that shit up on the spot, right?
7374517	7375258	I miss my calling.
7375739	7376260	Wayne Brady.
7376300	7377161	Get down with Aisha.
7377321	7378062	I'm coming for you.
7378643	7378984	All right.
7379444	7380185	It's not Wayne Brady.
7380225	7380846	It's Aisha.
7381307	7382829	Wayne Brady's one of the stars.
7382909	7383270	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7385780	7391745	Jason is going to be fielding our Fugle questions this week because some of our listeners are asking us questions.
7391845	7394867	Are we doing every question tonight or are you just picking some of your favorites?
7395147	7397689	I'll jump around a little bit and see how many we go for time.
7397890	7399291	Pick your favorites for time purposes.
7399331	7400151	Don't drag this out too long.
7400491	7402133	Tech 2030 starts us off with a ringer.
7403093	7403934	Nothing off limits?
7404314	7406936	Okay, I'm going to get crazy with this one.
7407036	7407777	What's your favorite color?
7408758	7409038	Laughter
7409878	7414820	My favorite color is dark green, sometimes dark purple, depending on my mood.
7415560	7415980	DarkSakura?
7416220	7418601	Black, because it depends on your version of color theory.
7418641	7420242	It's either all of the colors or none of the colors.
7421262	7421582	Loki?
7423003	7426904	Sadly enough, because of the show, I did a lot of orange stuff, so orange.
7427364	7427964	There you go.
7428905	7430025	I almost bought an orange bike.
7430839	7432280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7456360	7457200	What about my answer?
7457460	7459361	Okay, Jason, what's your answer?
7459461	7465022	You know, without going too crazy with it, what's funny is that I actually don't really have a favorite color anymore.
7465242	7466362	Growing up, it was green.
7466562	7469043	It kind of started to change to blue in the last couple of years.
7469983	7472224	I don't really identify a favorite color anymore.
7472364	7473044	It's kind of weird.
7473204	7477345	But green was the biggest portion of my youth for an incredibly long time.
7477385	7478505	Do you know I had green hair once?
7479561	7505694	I do not think I've seen pictures so I will go with I was in college in Alabama definitely did not see pictures so I was probably about 20 years old and had the top you know how people now are like doing their hair two different colors not the ombre thing but the underside one color the underside stayed brown the top was forest green manic panic which I don't even think you can get that color anymore fifth dream I love this comment in the chat room at live.vognover.com fifth dream says let me answer let me answer I have no answer
7506794	7508296	That's what Jason just did.
7509177	7510598	But Jason, I was going to say this.
7510638	7515902	You say you may not have particularly a favorite color, but don't you like when you go shopping for clothes or something, you're kind of drawn to one color?
7516042	7520746	My friends make fun of me because a lot of my wardrobe is all earth colors, like brown.
7521267	7522248	And it's kind of true.
7522488	7523589	I wear a lot of brown and green.
7523669	7525250	I wear a lot of brown and black.
7525290	7526011	I wear earth colors.
7526091	7527552	I don't go shopping for clothes.
7528453	7528553	PJ
7556054	7559217	Biggest letdown title or game-related news of the year?
7561178	7564561	Biggest letdown title or game-related news of the year?
7564701	7570366	Ooh, I'd really have to look at some of the stories from this year to remember.
7570386	7571447	I know what let me down.
7572828	7573108	Sorry.
7573629	7573989	Go for it.
7574069	7576852	When my Mass Effect 3 data pad stopped working so I couldn't stay at 100%.
7576892	7576992	True.
7577012	7577232	True story.
7581542	7583564	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7603984	7619392	I'm tempted to go through for the easy answer and say Xbox's original policies, but to be fair, they did change it and everything's cool now and the new consoles are doing just fine, so I can't really hate on that too much.
7620093	7621874	I'm going to say this.
7622474	7628378	The biggest disappointment for me this year is third-party publishers openly pooping on the Wii U.
7629338	7632583	EA's attitude towards the Wii U is my biggest disappointment this year.
7633144	7634647	I think that would be my honest to God answer.
7635503	7636023	That's a good answer.
7638085	7646010	I honestly don't have an answer to that question just because my involvement, lack of, precludes me from that this year.
7646970	7648151	Not in the new consoles.
7648411	7649812	Get up to speed.
7649972	7651073	You've got the controllers, though.
7651093	7651733	You've got the controllers.
7652534	7654115	Yes, I'm contributing in other ways right now.
7654135	7655256	Another question.
7655316	7655776	I'm getting there.
7656096	7661099	SSJ100Bat says, if there were a VOG slash OLR con, who would you want as the keynote speaker?
7661620	7661720	Ooh.
7665888	7666088	Me.
7666728	7668469	No.
7669630	7672691	I would want Jason Enos to be one of the speakers.
7672812	7673952	Yeah, I miss him.
7673972	7685098	I don't know if necessarily the keynote, but I just think as far as DDR community, which remember this show started as a music game community show, which was in large part to DDR.
7685278	7689900	I think we directly have Jason to thank for that kind of happening in the US in the first place.
7690400	7692802	So I sort of think we owe that debt.
7693622	7695383	If nothing else, to him.
7695483	7699184	So I would hope if there is a con, we can convince him to come say hello.
7700865	7701926	Keynote speaker.
7704327	7709889	I want the guy that plays Sekata Sanchiro to be our keynote speaker and to do it in character.
7711728	7714209	The President of Pinkberry
7736445	7741709	Wait, not the co-founder guy that got arrested for all that fucked up stuff or got to court.
7741749	7742990	He did some really fucked up stuff.
7743030	7743390	Not him.
7743610	7743950	Not him.
7744010	7744291	Not him.
7744611	7744851	All right.
7744911	7745191	Not him.
7745592	7745892	All right.
7746452	7748894	Jason, I don't know if you have an answer, but if not, another question.
7749775	7750055	Me?
7750315	7750815	I'm the voice.
7751156	7752236	Yeah.
7752437	7754418	Jason would be the voice that would announce all the speakers.
7754738	7756640	I would definitely introduce the keynote speaker.
7756680	7757060	How's that?
7757740	7758221	Oh, sorry.
7758361	7761343	Redertainment says a keynote address from Rob's mom.
7761864	7763685	I think Bobby Blackwolf should give a speech.
7763945	7765526	Yes, Bobby.
7766146	7771987	If there's going to be a keynote speaker, shouldn't Bobby Blackwolf open OLRCon?
7772148	7772888	Hell yes.
7772908	7774588	With commentary by your mom.
7776709	7777929	Rob, who's that guy up there?
7778069	7779150	There's the definitive answer.
7779230	7780070	Bobby and my mother.
7780230	7784171	And Travis Donovan, too, to be fair.
7784671	7791834	Because the name came up, Hunter R. would like to ask, Dearest Orange Lounge, is Pinkberry one of those make-your-own-frozen-yogurt places?
7792114	7792894	It's even better.
7793891	7794612	Better flavor.
7794712	7796653	You don't make it your own.
7796713	7805701	It's kind of traditional like Baskin Robbins behind the counter style, but the ingredients are fresh and good and beautiful.
7805921	7810025	And they're not paying us, so I hate that we keep giving them free advertising, but it is really good.
7810885	7812567	But they friended us both on Twitter.
7812967	7813367	Oh, did they?
7813627	7813807	Yeah.
7832573	7835795	Soft Serb yogurts that you can get from anywhere.
7835935	7836155	Yeah.
7836395	7839336	And it is pretty low calorie unless you get like peanut butter or something.
7839356	7841657	And you can get a mini size which is perfect.
7841937	7845318	Or you can get it in a cone if you're feeling like having a fat day like I do a lot.
7846439	7846739	All right.
7847139	7849800	If there's nothing else to add to that then another question.
7850905	7852246	Did we get Loki's answer?
7853646	7854786	On what makes Pinkberry different?
7854806	7855887	I don't think there's much you can add to that.
7855907	7856347	Oh, fair enough.
7856467	7857987	Yeah, good point.
7858128	7863349	We will then end with the one that I completely lost sight of, and it's in here somewhere.
7863429	7869011	Fifth Dream asks, What is the one game each of the hostings has been too ignored and should be played by everyone?
7869171	7873053	In other words, is there a little-known game you would force everyone to play if you could?
7874233	7874733	Oh, shit.
7875694	7876734	I have really picked the winners.
7879361	7900563	these are questions I wanted more warning on one game I would make everybody play if I could looking at the shelf of games over there I'm not in my vault so I really can't say I'll go for the easy cop out answer but it's so true because I need people to understand why we love the Guardian Legend
7900891	7903572	Yes, well, that was what I was going to say, but I knew you'd pick it too.
7904433	7905613	Sure, sure.
7905693	7906814	Loki, is there a game you'd make?
7907054	7907494	Oh, wait, no.
7907614	7909655	It's coming to me.
7909995	7911136	It has four letters.
7911216	7913217	It starts with grand and ends with five.
7913237	7914377	It's little known.
7915398	7916498	It's not little known.
7916898	7920440	And no, I would say Earth Defense Force 2017 or 2025.
7920940	7921581	Or Excite Truck.
7925172	7926373	Oh yes, Excite Truck.
7926433	7927854	It's actually a very worthy answer.
7928695	7931117	Some folks in chat, Red Entertainment, saying Mass Effect.
7931337	7932438	But it's not Little Known.
7932658	7934199	Yeah, that would be Shane's answer anyway.
7934219	7936140	Shane's not here, so fuck it.
7936401	7939523	Katamari sprang to mind for me pretty much immediately.
7939943	7942505	I think that's just above the cusp of Little Known.
7942925	7945107	It had a pretty reasonable bout of success.
7945127	7952613	Believe it or not, if you think about it, we probably have some 17 and 18 year olds that listen to this show that were probably kind of young when that game first came out.
7952653	7953433	They might have missed it.
7953894	7954094	I know.
7954735	7956118	We're getting older by the year.
7958081	7967027	I rather think that I would have said Fantasy Zone because it is one of my favorite little shooter games of all time.
7967127	7969629	It is my second favorite video game.
7970670	7977294	But it is fairly well known in the classic gaming community because it's a big Sega title.
7977354	7978275	It's been out forever.
7980757	7985380	So I am going to go... Fuck it, I'll just go with Fantasy Zone.
7986165	8010338	there is a part of me that wants to go like super duper old school and say everybody like you know because some of y'all missed the Atari 2600 and I would say kangaroo you all need to experience the frustration but yet awesome that comes with playing sword quest any of them air world earth or what was no air world didn't come out here what was the first one that came out I think it was earth world was the first I remember they were all they all kind of blurred together for me but that first sword quest game
8010894	8016680	Now, I will tell you, as far as old school Game Boy games, that not many people would think of Revenge of the Gator.
8018490	8019411	That was a good game.
8019751	8020051	Jason?
8021472	8024154	I actually would say Mother 3.
8026076	8036144	I definitely think Earthbound was little known, and playing the whole series is worth it, but Mother 3 is a fantastic game.
8036244	8040548	I've actually not finished it myself, but I've seen the entirety of the game beginning to end.
8041288	8062882	that game is just straight up fun like it's it's battle system has the charm of Mario RPG great writing great music the story is a bit against against the grain against the cuff it's it's quite fun like seek out this game if you even know what Earthbound is obviously it's technically Earthbound 2 it is the same in the storyline
8063542	8064623	Alright, wait, hold on.
8064684	8069329	Before we wrap, I just wanted to say I had to look it up and it was Earthworld.
8069750	8070370	It was going to bug me.
8070451	8073074	Sword Quest Earthworld was the first one and Fireworld was out too.
8073234	8074876	Wasn't that the one where they had the contest?
8075857	8079822	Where you would win all of this stuff but they never finished the series?
8081023	8085305	And just for the old school OLR people, I also have to throw out there BurgerTime.
8085545	8086505	You have to play BurgerTime.
8086826	8087586	I would agree with that.
8087626	8089767	That was a fun, silly classic.
8089787	8090367	Why, it is.
8091087	8101872	The hotel that I usually stay at in San Francisco has a little set-top arcade, a flat-top arcade, multi-main type thing.
8102732	8106293	And I always plop down and play BurgerTime on it if I'm not doing anything else.
8106394	8107034	Good times.
8107634	8110078	We will end with... Yay, one more.
8110138	8111200	Another question, another question.
8111240	8116648	We will end with William Murderface asking, which game releases are all of you looking forward to in 2014?
8116809	8120715	What is the first big thing on your radar for 2014?
8122948	8127590	whatever the next Mass Effect is because I kind of really don't care about much else.
8127730	8129331	One was announced, wasn't it?
8129651	8132233	Not exactly a core game but something related to it?
8132633	8135974	It's outside the trilogy story.
8136014	8137235	It's like a new thing.
8137515	8150641	And I love the universe so much that there's still this hopeful little spark inside of me that hasn't been completely stomped on by the writing team that hopes that there might be something a little bit less human-centric out
8152422	8161150	I'm keeping my fingers crossed if I'm going to be disappointed let me be disappointed let me be heartbroken but I still want to see what it is
8166158	8181331	believe it or not, Destiny which might surprise you because I don't usually talk about first person shooters but I'm really excited to check that game out and I'm hoping Nintendo gets Smash Brothers out this next year because I'm really looking forward to that as well Loki, what are you most looking forward to in 2014?
8181371	8193162	I want to check out No Man's Sky because that looks pretty sweet and then I don't know there's not a whole ton I'm actually looking forward to so far
8194095	8209285	It would be nice if Sunset Overdrive came out, because that looked like a really interesting trailer, but then again, so did, what was it, Fuse, I think, was the one, yeah, that was by Insomniac that ended up sucking, so I don't know.
8209305	8211927	We'll have to see.
8212147	8215710	I think there's just going to be a lot of stuff that we haven't seen announced yet, but it's going to be pretty good.
8215890	8223235	I'm hoping, too, that there'll be, like, something announced at E3 that we just don't know of yet, and I think that is also my answer.
8224727	8225748	Kelly Mantle and Courtney Act
8242425	8261203	I think Colton the Act is going to is almost a sure win for the top three that by the way that's that's what Courtney Act is Australian so her name is really Colton the Act Colton the Act which you gotta love that come on that's a great jacket but I think she's I think she's too good for the show I know that sounds really horrible but she's
8261523	8263667	Well, she's like huge in Australia already.
8263747	8264688	Like, it's just kind of weird.
8264728	8265069	I don't know.
8265249	8273642	But I also, I think Kelly Mantle, even though she had her own logo special a couple years ago and also might be too big for the show, I think she's going to do very well too.
8273683	8275826	But I like to bend and I like to cram based on the videos.
8276647	8278388	That concludes Orange Drag Radio.
8279009	8281090	Thank you all for your questions.
8281130	8290858	For those of you that actually know, if you actually know what the Reading is Fundamental podcast is, there might be like two people out there listening, that is going to come back this next year, so I'll say that much.
8292619	8294140	Google it, or look it up on iTunes.
8294741	8296902	Alright, let's move on.
8296922	8298283	We've got more gaming news to get to.
8298363	8298663	Loki.
8299704	8305989	Alright, so the first set of indie games coming to Xbox One are going to be
8307181	8307441	March 2014.
8307541	8314386	This is part of that ID at Xbox program that they have there.
8316188	8321952	This includes stuff from Halfbrick Studios, Double Fine, Crytek, and Vladimir.
8322673	8327757	So that's nice that they're finally going to start having some decent indie games on there.
8330679	8333522	Anything in particular that you personally are looking forward to?
8334597	8335958	Not really, because I haven't really seen.
8335978	8341741	I think a lot of it's just going to be ports of stuff that we're seeing already are coming to the PlayStation 4 and stuff.
8343402	8347385	I haven't really heard of any standout indie games.
8347405	8356370	Aside from, even though I've purchased it on pretty much every platform, Minecraft would be interesting to see what they do with Minecraft on the next-gen platforms.
8358354	8358654	Alright.
8359595	8362296	Yeah, I'm curious to see how Minecraft is on the next-gen platforms, too.
8362316	8366497	I'm thinking it'll be unlimited-sized worlds again, like it is on PC.
8366517	8369619	It'll just be more like PC, but with some of the console enhancements.
8369659	8370619	I think that'll be pretty cool.
8372280	8381984	Alright, well, there was a Killer Instinct tournament that happened, and it caused a lot of news to spread around the internet about Wildfire, about the Xbox One, and some DRM checks, because everybody's like...
8382944	8386065	Did the DRM magically come back to the Xbox One?
8386465	8398690	Because what happened is there was actually this clip going on of a Killer Instinct tournament, and what happens partway through this tournament is that the Xbox One comes up to the dashboard and says, Do you own this gamer app?
8398990	8400250	If you have the disc, insert it now.
8400290	8402471	If there's no disc, make sure you're signed into Xbox Live.
8402751	8405732	If you don't have the rights for playing it, you'll need to buy it at the Xbox Store.
8406092	8410234	So everybody was like, Oh my God, the Xbox One's doing check-ins, da-da-da-da-da.
8410954	8417980	Well now, Bobby talked about this on his show a little bit tonight as well, and kind of gives some insight to this, so I'm going to just totally bite off what he said.
8418380	8425906	But basically, it wasn't that the Xbox was necessarily doing an online check-in, because if you think about it, I mean logically think about it.
8426747	8431850	It would have already been connected once in the past 24 hours Why would it suddenly disconnect during the tournament?
8432170	8449820	The problem was that somebody was playing the game on a system that wasn't theirs They were playing it on a different system And if you think about it, Xbox and even PlayStation kind of already do that today So this isn't necessarily something new It just happened in the middle of the game
8450840	8471227	Now, not that I'm necessarily defending what's happening here, because that is really weird that it would have allowed the game to launch in the first place, and that it stops the game in progress or what have you, that's a little bit weird, and that there ought to be a little bit of give when you're going to go over to friends' houses and play games or do these tournaments or what have you, but, you know...
8472068	8486110	if you're gonna play these games make sure they're on the Xbox you bought them on or these things might happen you can't just go around and take your digital game and download it on all these other different consoles it isn't gonna work that way it doesn't work that way on the 360
8488289	8491252	Bobby Blackwolf chimes in and says their 4G dropped.
8491372	8492293	That's what happened.
8492753	8495816	So it was checking on the internet, checking on the internet, and then it dropped.
8496116	8501981	This happens on my 360 games today, actually, because I had to get my console replaced because of the red ring.
8502502	8511009	And even though I transferred my licenses, for some reason, whenever I play an older game, like I go into Geometry Wars, let's say, that was like the first arcade game I bought on Xbox 360.
8511790	8533313	I see the demo title screen for like two seconds and then all of a sudden it flips to the retail screen because what it's doing it's checking the internet making sure I really own it and then it will update my demo copy of the game with oh Green Sky is trying to play it he bought the game here it is so this already happens on the 360 it's just kind of weird
8533633	8540919	and Bobby's telling me that the reason why it's still checking is that if I do the license transfer, you still have to delete and re-download the game.
8541199	8541900	Good lord.
8541940	8543401	That's a lot of games, Bobby.
8543421	8544242	That's like 50 games.
8544962	8546704	I'd rather just be online, honestly.
8547104	8550106	And how often am I playing my old 360 games anymore?
8550627	8551447	Once every few months.
8551548	8551968	That's it.
8553929	8554950	So just bottom line...
8556431	8581180	keep the digital rights rules in the back of your head because it's going to be the same on 360 and these systems and no, they did not suddenly insert in all these rules that they explicitly said they weren't going to do so be careful in jumping to conclusions gaming journalists I'm watching you face alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
8581556	8584338	I've been having a discussion about aliens.
8585058	8585359	Really?
8585679	8585879	Yes.
8586580	8587100	Are they real?
8588301	8588661	No!
8591083	8592704	So, I brought up Namco, hi.
8592724	8593424	I think you're wrong.
8593925	8594145	Huh?
8594405	8595105	I think you're wrong.
8595546	8596206	There's aliens.
8596326	8597227	We just don't know them yet.
8597707	8598488	Star Trek is real.
8598688	8601410	No, but I guarantee you if they showed up, we'd try to fuck them.
8603851	8604252	What?
8605773	8606073	Nothing.
8606573	8608054	If fandom is to be believed.
8608775	8608955	Okay.
8609395	8611118	Somebody would ship them in 30 seconds.
8611999	8614162	Rob, anything can be shipped.
8614582	8615183	Oh, trust me.
8615423	8615724	I know.
8615984	8617606	Especially the ship from Galaga.
8618648	8619909	How's that for transition?
8620829	8648084	Namco High I've been playing it and it's fucking weird it's a dating sim it's more like a visual novel really less a dating sim although if you really want to just romance somebody all you have to do is pick them and only them and do all of their scenes and you're guaranteed cute little romances but you have certain characters that you can romance like Mr. Driller or Lolo from Klonoa
8648864	8650465	or the Galaga ship.
8650986	8651826	Who is awesome?
8653227	8655269	Galaga refers to Galaga in the third person.
8655689	8656630	Galaga is amazing.
8657170	8658551	Galaga says greetings, humans.
8660392	8664475	Of course, when I played it, I got the deluxe set.
8664655	8673741	You can unlock the characters for $1.95 individually if you want to get past the... Ew, no, I wouldn't want a fucking Asari.
8673801	8674102	Yuck.
8674402	8674642	I mean...
8679253	8682735	I was trying to talk about Homestuck, I mean Namco Highstuck.
8684096	8703129	So anyway, you start off the game, you've got all of your Namco characters, you can also pay for premium characters for $1.95 a pop, $4.95 in sets of three, or $14.95 for the whole set, which is actually what I did, and I got the soundtrack, because I did the pre-order thing.
8704349	8706471	So I have 18 dateable characters.
8706671	8708693	And like I said, I mentioned Homestuck.
8708713	8710154	There are three Homestuck characters in it.
8710734	8714497	You have Therese, who I dated first because she's awesome.
8715017	8717179	And then you have Dave Sprite, who made me sad.
8717979	8719881	And James, who was freaking weird.
8720161	8724304	And then after that, I think the next one I did was...
8727646	8733670	Donko, the drum from Taiko no Tatsujin, who starts off on her cell phone in detention.
8733750	8735771	She's like the total Valley Girl type character.
8736512	8741355	And then I did Richard Miller from Time Crisis, who was kind of weird.
8741995	8744317	Everyone's really just bizarre in this game.
8745117	8769209	but they're all bizarre in an incredibly entertaining way and like Pac-Man comes out and gives you advice but the advice is always be true to yourself although sometimes the advice is maybe you shouldn't be true to yourself and like the principal is Dig Dug and the detention teacher is King from Tekken and the only sound he ever makes is a roar and then he yells at you
8770309	8775716	It's really out there and super funny and I think the whole thing was well done.
8776096	8787650	And for a lot of these games, there's people who may not get all the games these characters came from like Albatross and Hitomi and Amazonia.
8789192	8795001	And, uh, yeah, Fifth Dream posted a picture of Galaga talking to the cousin.
8795702	8801451	You play the cousin of the Prince of All Cosmos who gets thrown in detention because he rolled up the school into a giant Katamari.
8803165	8803685	It's just funny.
8803705	8807666	You have to fight evil Namco Hai at one point and they're all robots.
8809366	8811366	So I didn't realize this game was actually already out.
8811567	8813087	Yeah, it's an HTML5 game.
8813247	8831270	The HTML5 was done by a group called DateNaito and I've actually emailed them to ask them what their licensing costs are for their engine because I'm trying to do a webcomic in Flash but I would like to be able to do a visual novel style and have it be accessible for people on iOS.
8832330	8835273	So, um, but yeah, it's, it's, it's cute.
8835293	8841439	And if anybody wants to see other screen caps from it, you can go to my Tumblr, uh, kurotsubasa.tumblr.com.
8842060	8844542	I might repost some stuff on the OLR, um, Tumblr.
8845703	8845924	So.
8846604	8846865	All right.
8847786	8848847	It's, it's fucking cute.
8848867	8849988	Namco dating sim.
8850128	8850708	Good times.
8850949	8853171	We're, we're awkward.
8853932	8856154	Sort of dating sim, but really more visual novel.
8857020	8857260	All right.
8857960	8859021	A good waste of time.
8859621	8859841	Yeah.
8859861	8860801	A waste of time in a good way.
8860841	8867783	I can sit there for like 30 minutes and go, oh, and it usually actually only takes me that long because I'm doing screen caps because I'm like, what the fuck did they just say?
8869384	8869784	All right.
8870584	8871284	Moving on.
8871864	8874145	Loki, I don't know if your story is on a dating sim, but.
8876826	8878066	No, thank goodness.
8879107	8880147	No, it's talking about the.
8880822	8903961	Steam Machine Teardowns because just recently the 300 people that made it into the hardware beta received their prototype Steam Machines and of course iFixit somehow got one as part of their Teardown pages that they do and they found out that there's a ton of expensive stuff in there including an NVIDIA GTX 780 also a Core i5 4570 running at 3.6 GHz
8910274	8916597	and pricing everything out, it looks like that that machine runs roughly about $1,300.
8918098	8920359	So a pretty powerful little PC.
8922781	8923421	I want one.
8923901	8924562	Yeah, me too.
8926523	8928504	They're going to sell a $1,500 TV-connected device.
8928524	8928824	I just...
8937320	8940782	I just don't know who the audience is for those high-end machines.
8941223	8945086	I think the low-end ones have more potential to do more business, but I don't know.
8945126	8945846	A lot less games?
8946907	8948048	Well, not necessarily.
8948148	8951070	Some of those Steam games don't take much, especially the indie stuff.
8951550	8957355	This whole thing, every time I hear... I'm really, really into it.
8958236	8962299	I mentioned in the intro last week that SteamOS was out for hobbyists and system builders.
8962999	8964179	I'm looking forward to it.
8964339	8969100	I'm going to dip my toes in and see if there's something that I can do with it and see what they come up with.
8969500	8970621	I'm very interested in this.
8970741	8976862	But the hardware portion of it, sans the controller, doesn't make a lick of sense to me.
8977402	8980143	We don't plug computers into our TVs.
8981263	8989484	The people that actually plug computers into their TVs are incredibly few in the larger community.
8992385	9000527	The things that get plugged into TVs are small, tiny little... Crap, I've completely forgotten the word.
9001888	9004628	Home entertainment system devices.
9005629	9011970	And I just... I'm insanely interested at the same time I don't understand it.
9013471	9016012	It's going to be a very interesting 2014 for Valve.
9016252	9017192	That's about all I can say.
9017954	9045799	I'm more interested in the front end, how everything's going to work because mainly I would love to have I'm not necessarily going to buy a $1300 PC but I'd like to be able to build a PC and have that front end experience that you get with a console nowadays with the integration with Netflix and the different apps and stuff that you can put on there and have it work pretty seamless would be nice like Steam Big Picture Mode works great
9046201	9049354	It would be nice if there was non-gaming apps.
9049495	9051141	I mean, I know they sell software and stuff.
9051161	9052065	I'm talking about like, you know.
9052950	9056633	Skype, Netflix, Hulu, that kind of stuff.
9056673	9070465	Yeah, and like I was talking about with the PS4 controller I'm very close to turning Steam onto big picture mode by default so that I can just grab my controller, turn it on because it's Bluetooth paired and go to it.
9070965	9073928	It's a nice interface and there's going to be a lot of benefits to it.
9074088	9076390	It's just the machine itself that confounds me.
9079228	9079628	All right.
9081049	9082530	Jason, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.
9082550	9083331	Oh, yeah, it's me anyways, isn't it?
9083351	9083871	That's right.
9084732	9086973	Well, wait, let me read a quick comment from our chat.
9087013	9087213	Sorry.
9087634	9094598	Actdeft at live.vognetwork.com says, Remember, people, the beta build of the Steam machine is exclusive to the beta, and it's not one model of the Steam machine.
9094618	9101123	Well, yeah, we mentioned that's a high-end system and that there's low-end systems as well, and maybe that's more the audience for it.
9101183	9106406	But it's going to be interesting to see how these things do put up against the console.
9106686	9108688	They can't bring down those costs that much.
9109588	9115893	Well, you may spend more on the front end buying the console, but you can't argue those deals, man.
9116874	9117254	We'll see.
9117514	9118254	This is very true.
9118274	9119195	Alright, now we'll move on.
9119215	9119455	Jason.
9119876	9120196	Alright.
9120876	9125199	X-Men and the Simpsons Arcade have suddenly disappeared from the PlayStation Network.
9126020	9137388	They are still available on Xbox Live Arcade and doubly so considering that they are also available on the last chance on Marvel Games sale that Xbox Live is currently running right now.
9138028	9139269	No official word.
9141050	9143671	Polygon has reached out to Konami to figure out why this has happened.
9144552	9152376	But no changes in price on Xbox Live Arcade, but outright removed from Sony's PlayStation Network listings.
9152796	9154617	Licensing, maybe.
9155278	9157399	It remains to be seen that it's so console-specific.
9157959	9162185	It could also be that the holidays are delaying activity on Xbox Live.
9162265	9165189	I would be interested to see if that's still the case in two weeks.
9165329	9168353	Delistings do not require human intervention.
9168453	9170176	If they wanted something delisted, it's gone.
9171880	9177003	either that or legal marketing whoever deals with this at Konami just plain fucked up.
9177763	9178363	Maybe.
9178764	9179524	You delist it.
9179744	9182225	You either schedule a delisting or you take it down.
9182265	9184666	There is no ifs, ands, or buts about this.
9185827	9189589	I'm just thinking back to the Skullgirl stuff last week and it seemed like it was staggered on the two.
9190730	9195952	That had a contractual end though so they wouldn't do it before then and everybody was aware that that was actually going to happen.
9196132	9199334	This is just straight delisting for a game that games that
9199614	9200875	Probably don't even really need it.
9201115	9204177	Well, and Simpsons was a PlayStation Plus free game for a while.
9204197	9206019	That's how I got it, which I find interesting.
9207960	9211122	Alright, well, sadly, not going to be able to get that anymore.
9211643	9215806	I wonder if it's still on their servers, though, so if I delete the game from my drive, can I actually get the game back?
9215846	9217427	In fact, oh shit, I think I did delete it.
9217487	9218428	I wonder if I can get it back.
9219008	9219228	Uh-oh.
9220069	9220689	DarkSakura, take it away.
9246843	9248064	Oh, this one was to me.
9248984	9254006	Dear Jamie, I was offended on your behalf for the email bashing you guys for voicing your opinion on the VGX show.
9254547	9261070	What benefit do people get from writing into talk shows to bash commentators for their thoughts?
9262330	9263611	I wasn't really offended.
9264551	9267693	Oh, and Reagan's policies didn't actually destroy the economy.
9267733	9269233	They saved it from the gas lines at the Carter.
9269393	9272455	Yeah, but it set the pace for the thing we have now.
9272995	9274375	Too much politics.
9274855	9276456	Syntax error.
9276556	9276836	Ready.
9278376	9280676	He also built the foundation for the prosperity we saw in the 90s.
9280736	9284357	It took Clinton and Bush number two to really ruin the economy, and Nickelback doesn't completely suck.
9284397	9285217	They only kind of suck.
9286317	9288458	Thanks for the great show, Labrat Y2K.
9290478	9294279	That was a laundry list of internet insult memes right there.
9295299	9299800	I could argue the politics behind that with some hard numbers, but I will not.
9301162	9302154	Got one from...
9304702	9315209	CK Ender Hey OLR, I'll start by saying I've been a loyal podcast listener for about two years and I hope you'll keep doing what you're doing as you guys are an integral part of my Monday afternoons.
9315630	9321454	Hopefully I won't be criticized too harshly on grammar, but something I heard on the show this past weekend 12-15-13 stuck with me.
9322134	9326377	I understand that this topic is too political to read on the show, but I felt like I had to write this.
9326437	9333181	When you folks mentioned the NSA is spying on our MMOs, I felt like there is a bit of misinformation on the lack of information you've been provided with.
9335143	9337664	There's a more global reach to what they are doing.
9337804	9342286	It's not only to listen for communications of any terrorist activities or things of that nature.
9342766	9351231	It's a known fact that in 2011, North Korea formed several farms for well gold, which it was selling the proceeds of funding their nuclear weapons program.
9351611	9352491	Yeah, there was that too.
9357349	9364635	The practice is comparable to diamond trafficking from Africa to fund warlords or the opium trades in the Middle East funding any of the terrorist groups there.
9365136	9379529	Now, I'm not employed by the NSA or any government agency for that matter, but it's been speculated that what they are doing is making purchases from these gold sellers and tracking the funds in an effort to shut down the operations and thus limiting the funds of our national adversaries.
9380449	9387594	Sure, people may think it's a waste of taxpayers' money to have people sit around and play WoW, but frankly, if it can help financially disarm a nuclear program, then why not?
9388154	9389155	That's a very good point.
9389936	9394679	The age we live in is not only an age of physical conflict, but wars are fought in cyberspace as well.
9395059	9400823	The fact that this is just coming to open news does not mean it's not something that has been going on for ages.
9401163	9402984	The example I cited earlier is not the only one.
9403104	9409829	China has been using prisons to farm gold for sellers in several MMOs, while being, of course, the predominant one due to its population.
9410509	9419091	Now, once a player purchases from any gold seller, it opens them up for identity fraud, thus providing further resources such as additional funds, social security numbers, ID, and things of that sort.
9420612	9425373	And as tensions grow tighter in international affairs, it's reasonable that the government looks into this.
9425573	9427854	Think of all the folks who buy gold on a daily basis.
9427954	9436436	Players may feel they're getting ahead in a video game, but they may also be unknowingly funding nuclear warfare, foreign governments, and any other number of illicit trades or activities.
9436516	9442478	Can I stop here for a minute, just real quick, just because I have to say this, because as a big time MMO player and all this, this really bugs me.
9442818	9444938	People need to stop buying gold online.
9445219	9452761	People need to realize what, and I don't necessarily think every time they're buying gold, they're necessarily funding all of this.
9452901	9460223	Not to discredit the emailer's opinion, because I think it's a very well thought out point, and I think this emailer brings up some good points that are completely valid.
9461244	9466347	But I just think we need, as MMO players, to stop buying gold in the first place.
9466407	9470630	Because not only is it necessarily funding this stuff, but it's funding the theft of accounts.
9470950	9475613	It's funding these companies that will do anything to get the gold in-game, including compromise accounts.
9475914	9478115	And you're usually putting your own self at risk.
9478515	9482118	Do not buy third-party currency in these games.
9482318	9484540	You are part of the problem if you're doing that.
9485140	9486302	Make it not worth it.
9500920	9501641	That's what I'm saying.
9501721	9503162	We all have to take that responsibility.
9503182	9503583	Make it not worth it.
9503603	9504924	If I'm right, I believe it was abandoned.
9505324	9506825	Educate other players.
9507146	9509007	Anyway, let me get back into... Where was I?
9509147	9509327	Yes.
9511890	9517334	So to say at the NSA there are a bunch of spies spying on Americans, as some people have, is not entirely accurate.
9517374	9527222	So with that, I wouldn't say they are looking on the average player who can leak information or communicate with terrorist cells, but to limit the financial gain of any group or nation who wishes to fund themselves in this nature.
9527483	9528263	And that's a good point.
9528784	9529024	But I...
9531733	9538997	I don't think, however, that the attempts to do so in the past have been as successful as they were probably hoping it would be.
9539637	9541218	That's my thought, but I'll continue.
9541478	9549643	Maybe if there was a little less transparency, there'd be more people kind of quick to believe that if they could see this value that you're pointing out.
9550043	9556687	But to be fair, I mean, we're kind of making assumptions to agree with this emailer too.
9556907	9558788	There's assumptions all around, right?
9558808	9558888	Yeah.
9559308	9561129	Let me read the next part.
9561989	9566591	As for the right to do this, a thing that happened shortly after 9-11 called the Patriot Act.
9567572	9568892	Oh, that's a whole other can of worms.
9568992	9571633	The bill passed with very little contest from anyone, praised by millions.
9572073	9574374	Those who spoke out against it were chastised and berated.
9574855	9578816	It essentially gave the NSA power to do whatever they wish in the defense of terrorism.
9583238	9592309	While I do not know where the hosts of the show stand on that topic in particular, we sit here 12 years later chastising the NSA for doing something the nation encouraged them to do in the first place.
9592789	9600618	I myself was completely against that because it seemed like a big knee-jerk reaction as many people in this country are apt to do.
9601713	9620716	while I don't have a problem with surveillance as long as there is transparency that the surveillance is happening I'm perfectly fine with that I would have no problem with CCTV all over the place because honestly the only people who should be worried about having their stuff tracked are people who have something to hide
9621278	9625620	Not all, I mean, not to, again, not to get too political, but just something to think about.
9625720	9628081	Not all surveillance is necessarily bad.
9628641	9629441	Here's an example.
9630082	9632563	I like it when the mall parking lot has surveillance.
9632903	9635164	So that if something happens to my car, it's on tape.
9635184	9636104	You have it on tape.
9637605	9646209	Or what about for those hotels that have CCTV and caught, you know, murders happening or, you know, people being attacked.
9646229	9649530	What about that whole, what's that called, the knockout game thing?
9651141	9657890	But you know when you're going to the mall, maybe the criminals are too dumb to remember, but you know you're probably going to be on film.
9658190	9663377	But it's when that privacy, that reasonable expectation for privacy is breached that people get pissed off.
9663658	9668204	And I think a lot of people assumed that the cybering they were doing in MMO games was private.
9671041	9673604	Well, honestly, and I'm just going to say this right now.
9674244	9681352	I have no problem with having my dirty laundry out there because, honestly, the fuck they don't care.
9681372	9682613	Well, let's get started, girl.
9682913	9683334	No, no, no.
9683914	9684975	I don't think you know what I mean.
9685776	9688759	You know, if they have my...
9689620	9691261	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9711832	9712533	and send me back.
9712773	9713814	That's seriously how it went.
9714054	9716156	And I ran away from home a couple of times because fuck that place.
9717438	9719339	Wow, this email got a lot.
9719379	9719680	Alright.
9720280	9722543	I don't care who knows that.
9723143	9723964	It's part of who you are now.
9724084	9725666	Everybody's got something.
9725706	9727327	It made me the awesome person I am today.
9728588	9733290	In closing, I do love the show and appreciate that you give everyone a voice and remain subjective.
9733730	9737111	I will happily continue to listen so long as the show continues to be open-minded.
9737432	9740173	Provide me with hours of video game news and overall entertainment.
9740233	9742633	Thank you so much, CK Ender.
9743134	9745855	And for the record, I was not a troublemaker in school.
9745935	9749976	I got in one fight that anyone saw that had a witness.
9750296	9751797	Would you say your mama got scared?
9753744	9754865	By me having one fight?
9755786	9757028	Oh, no, I know what you mean now.
9757288	9759530	No, it wasn't Fresh Prince.
9759690	9762313	No, and I didn't have lots of visits to the principal's office.
9762373	9764094	My problems were strictly at home.
9764955	9772502	But there was this one girl who was just irritating the shit out of me, throwing... Because I was the, you know, the gothy, geeky...
9773163	9774084	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9798641	9803044	Well, to go back to the email, I just will say I have an open mind with that email.
9803484	9806626	Not to suck up, but just, you know, at the end there, I do have an open mind to that email.
9806646	9808327	I think it was a well-presented perspective.
9809148	9809448	Thank you.
9810089	9823577	It paints a very good alternative to something that has been a truth for the last decade and not just the, oh God, NSA spying that every governmental black box is being shoved into in the last year.
9823637	9827140	It paints a good devil's advocate perspective we weren't able to do last week.
9828261	9840251	I will say though, we do have some chat comments of course over at live.vognetwork.com Let's see, what was the comment about MM2K in chat says, okay, that's World of Warcraft but what about their Xbox Live spying?
9840331	9841332	What's the justification?
9842943	9866672	Dungeon Buster says if it involves telecommunications you can always assume that there will be someone out there trying to find a way to tap it NSA's had its wrist slapped as far back as the 70s there was congressional outrage and then nothing happened until the next scandal this is not their first rodeo Ranma says they've been doing this for years and now people are acting out about it fuck out of here so interesting perspectives all over let's move on to the next email though for time's sake
9868372	9870353	Well, that was actually the end of that email regardless.
9870613	9872515	So, thank you for the well-thought-out email.
9872575	9873095	We have two left.
9873155	9875176	One of them is still UT, but it's not long.
9875857	9876197	Hey, guys.
9876777	9878338	First of all... Good job editing, first off.
9878719	9878919	Thank you.
9878939	9881601	First off, count me among the people who actually like Nickelback.
9882021	9886224	Not the greatest band in the world, but they're enjoyable enough and don't deserve nearly the level of crap they get.
9886364	9887364	Next email.
9887444	9888205	Shut up.
9888285	9888745	I'm kidding.
9888805	9889205	I'm kidding.
9889225	9889506	Shut up.
9890547	9896993	Secondly, while the show is mostly enjoyable, I have to bring up the continued ignoring of all the other services while looking at the feed of Gabe Newell.
9897374	9897794	You know what?
9897954	9901839	I actually like Steam, so I'm using what I like, so whatever.
9902259	9911429	While I don't ask that you ignore Steam sales, they're clearly exciting for Steam's user base, but the way you and most other games media go on, people would be forgiven for thinking that Steam...
9911889	9913750	was all that mattered in the PC space.
9913890	9926698	Meanwhile, you guys are ignoring the massive GOG holiday sales where over 600 plus titles going up to half off are the massive 48-hour free Fallout giveaway they did.
9926978	9928719	I didn't know about it until you just said that.
9929439	9931521	I took advantage of that.
9932161	9933182	What's that, Loki?
9933722	9934803	I took advantage of that.
9934823	9935463	Why didn't you tell me?
9937981	9941324	There are also sales on Indie Game Stand, Humble Store, and Desura.
9941764	9949611	Recently, the only time you guys have ever mentioned anything other than a Steam sale was not on Steam sale, was basically developers trying to drum up support for getting greenlit.
9950154	9971682	by the way there was one that Catastrophic Moggy linked me to that I can't remember it was a UK site that takes international funds but had a Doctor Who game on there that I was very close to getting but I cannot for the life of me remember the URL now I just want to say though you mentioned Humble or the emailer mentioned Humble Store and we cover almost every single Humble bundle that comes out because they're always such great deals and they give Steam keys yeah
9972302	9987000	And I'll mention that the last Steam sale, or maybe the one before last, I was mentioning a lot about Amazon had better deals and even I think Gamefly was doing some deals and stuff that were better than what was on the Steam store.
9988161	9990124	There's a lot of alternatives out there.
9991735	9998479	And just a blanket statement that the reason why Steam tends to get the most coverage is Steam is the most prolific.
9999039	10006344	And not to belittle what the other stores are doing, but keep in mind that Steam is trying to do things that are beyond the storefront.
10006885	10008646	And I love good old games.
10009266	10012929	I think it's great that there's a method set up for some of those classics.
10013189	10014070	I love my classics.
10014470	10015510	I love good old games.
10015611	10020734	And I'm glad to hear they're having sales and a lot of that stuff is available.
10021234	10026979	But keep in mind that Steam also is pushing things forward with the trading card thing.
10027379	10028761	With the family sharing.
10029101	10030722	With the operating system.
10030782	10041011	And even though you might not necessarily be a fan of any of that, you can't deny that these are things that are pushing stores in general in another direction.
10041451	10044253	That's why they tend to dominate the coverage.
10044734	10046775	It's a little bit of a two-edged sword.
10047416	10048577	And I know what he's getting at.
10049197	10057860	You make a very fair point in the sense that there is a lot of non-monetary news like Steam Machine announcement and everything else that's been happening.
10058280	10064463	Yes, Steam does a ton of new things that are making landslide, that are making waves in the news.
10064883	10076387	That said, I said just myself today, I picked up Electronic Super Joy for $1.50 and You Don't Know Jack for $5 and we do off the cuff these games that we got for dirt cheap from Steam.
10077387	10080069	Way more often than any other vendor out there.
10080249	10083290	So I 100% agree with his point.
10084351	10094837	I interject the fact that news is important too, but I completely agree that we definitely do bias Steam for our look at our deals, look at our steals kind of thing.
10095126	10095847	Three comments.
10096548	10100251	SSJ100Matt says, we've mentioned GOG in the past.
10100291	10102293	Keep in mind he does have a deep dislike towards Steam.
10103214	10109060	Brad from PodCulture says, 75% of my Steam stuff comes from the humble bundles and the rest from huge sales they have.
10109501	10110642	And FifthDream says, Indie Royale.
10112113	10113634	Yeah, I think I bought one of their bundles once.
10113914	10114314	But anyway.
10114775	10116756	No, I mean, not to belittle the email.
10117176	10120478	It's a fair point that don't all sales deserve equal coverage.
10120618	10129284	And I think this show sometimes, and this has come up on another topic, tends to be a reflection of what gamers are talking about.
10129504	10132446	And Steam, you know, look at whatever gaming blogs are out there.
10132846	10135148	Steam does typically dominate that coverage.
10135848	10165537	but I'm all for, you know what, if there's this great indie thing going on and you guys email in about it or tweet us or get it to our attention I'm all about getting this stuff exposure, absolutely we have no problem mentioning any of this, it just happens to be whatever we've kind of and honestly, there's just sometimes I pull up Steam just to peruse their you know, library, find something completely bizarre and go that's freaking weird, like that what was that game, Loki, the ballpoint shooter
10167491	10170952	Um, let's see, that was... Because I bought it.
10171633	10173593	I have to look it up now because I don't remember.
10173693	10177094	It was, uh, Ballpoint, Ballpoint Universe Infinite.
10177494	10177574	Yeah.
10177594	10180996	And it was one of, like, some green light game that looked pretty cool.
10181236	10184337	It was just a neat concept, so it was like, two bucks, click.
10184757	10186197	You know, I had that lovely wallet.
10186217	10186777	Thank you, Loki.
10187978	10188438	You're welcome.
10188994	10190455	I have used it all up yesterday.
10193577	10199301	To continue with the email, which is nearly done, again, I feel the need to reiterate that I don't have anything against people who like Steam.
10199461	10206546	However, the media blackout on anything that isn't Steam only serves to undermine what should be an open platform, essentially turning it into a Valve console.
10207486	10215772	While I hope you guys don't take this as offensive, and I rarely do, though I imagine people are already shit-talking me in your chat.
10217463	10219685	Only a little bit, but not really.
10219785	10220886	I wouldn't say shit.
10221106	10221766	No, I wouldn't either.
10221806	10223667	I'd say I put around the line of a juicy fart.
10225348	10225929	I'm kidding.
10226709	10230172	I actually have zero problem with Raw Steel UT personally.
10230732	10234234	When points are presented succinctly like this?
10234254	10236576	He makes good points that may not always be popular.
10236776	10244541	Yes, and I'm all for hearing the points that may not be popular when they're presented in a tactful manner.
10245043	10246784	Yes, it has to go.
10246805	10250147	When it's fuck you, you fucking fuck, I'm not going to hear it, but he doesn't do that.
10251168	10262677	No, and see, I have no problem with information being presented to me that may be kind of the opposite of what I think, as long as it's presented in an intellectually and fact-based manner.
10262737	10264519	And that's kind of two emails tonight that have done that.
10264939	10265920	I know, and I love it.
10266100	10266981	I freaking love it.
10267561	10273249	I mean, that's why I actually look at progressive Republican websites.
10273269	10274150	I don't know if I told you that.
10274791	10277555	To look for the conservative point of view.
10277715	10279017	I listen to conservative talk radio.
10279157	10280619	Done from an intelligent manner.
10283082	10287966	Unfortunately, what I hear isn't always intelligent, but some of it's pretty good.
10290828	10292989	Just know that I still enjoy your show.
10293069	10294991	I'm just asking for a teeny bit more fairness.
10295271	10296352	Regards, Rostel UT.
10296432	10296852	P.S.
10297473	10298774	I also love me some Lady Gaga.
10298794	10300695	I'm not a huge fan of Beyonce, though.
10301936	10303117	You are entitled to that opinion.
10303157	10304938	Okay, his music tastes are redeemed a little bit, at least.
10305859	10307420	I just like calling Beyonce bejesus.
10308140	10308921	Yeah, beezus.
10310222	10311783	No, because that was Beezus and Ramona.
10316387	10317429	So I can't go there.
10317569	10318490	I have to call her bejesus.
10318530	10320052	Those were my books growing up.
10320132	10322816	Or if we were going to do the J with the Y sounds, it's bejesus.
10324213	10324673	More emails?
10324914	10325094	Yes.
10325274	10325694	Last one.
10325874	10326254	Last one.
10326375	10326655	I think.
10327295	10328276	Hi, OLR.
10328416	10329396	Hi.
10329416	10330297	Hi.
10330597	10336641	I'm sending you a very last minute email this week with a timely theme with a question and a response to my own question.
10336741	10337041	Really?
10338202	10339163	Now here we go.
10339803	10340223	Ellipse.
10341144	10353612	Now that the Steam Winter Sale is underway until 1-3-14, what five games per person response that are on sale you think everyone should buy provided that they don't already have said games and that they actually afford to buy them?
10353752	10356413	You have to appreciate the irony of this email.
10356434	10358014	Juxtaposition wins.
10358315	10359235	I fucking do.
10359255	10359795	I fucking do.
10359835	10365519	Ross Steele, even though you're sitting there rolling your eyes to the back of your head right now, you have to appreciate the irony.
10365539	10370481	There are three letters on Ross Steele UT's forehead right now, and it's S-M-H.
10371002	10372823	Alright, anyhow.
10373849	10376771	Okay, well, I will go ahead and read our readers.
10376831	10377771	And it's Spazinator, by the way.
10377912	10378092	Yes.
10378972	10379693	Or Ragenator now.
10380393	10382694	For me, I recommend the following games in no particular order.
10383195	10390879	Flat Out, Magic 2014 Special Edition, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, Strike Suit Zero Mega Bundle, and Pinball FX Two Tables.
10390999	10391820	Any or all of them.
10392580	10393321	Any and all of them.
10394341	10394862	I don't know, Rob.
10394962	10395322	What do you say?
10395702	10399925	Civ V, Spelunky, Rogue Legacy...
10405476	10408618	Super Hexagon, Path of Exile in the free-to-play section
10423547	10429212	I'm probably going to go with the Stanley Parable because it's on sale right now.
10430133	10432094	The Angry Video Game Nerd game.
10432615	10436358	It's a pretty fun little platformer, especially if you're a fan of his reviews.
10439200	10440261	I will also go with DuckTales.
10440942	10441342	It's on sale.
10443272	10448618	Even though I already have it, I'm just saying for people who don't have it right now, it's on sale, so go get it.
10450740	10451721	What else was I playing?
10454965	10459430	Bioshock Infinite, which I haven't started yet, but I'm still excited about playing it.
10460370	10473979	and I'd actually say Dragon Age Origins because it's five bucks now for the whatever great version is and I have me some elves to play as.
10475580	10482564	Loki, I don't know if he can think of five Steam games or after the email before any PC platform games that are worth checking out right now?
10484145	10488587	I would probably go with that stuff because depending on what you have already I
10489721	10519305	Borderlands 2 if you don't have that already Bioshock Infinite probably oh let's see Skyrim I mean if you don't have Skyrim good point Just Cause 2 only when it goes on the flash sale because it is only 7 it's funny it was on sale for more than it is now on sale for so but just because of the multiplayer mod
10520338	10524841	and I guess maybe Surgeon Simulator 2013.
10526942	10527322	Jason?
10528863	10535667	My overlap is pretty funny, but You Don't Know Jack, Starbound, Rogue Legacy, Just Cause 2, and Papers, Please.
10536367	10538748	Oh, I need to check out Papers, Please myself.
10539449	10545632	Also, Tech2030 in chat says, even though people don't call it a real using Cody Fingers game, I'm going to say Gone Home.
10545872	10546713	That's another good pick.
10547193	10548433	Yeah, I need to start that.
10548914	10549234	Alright.
10549608	10553369	But if anybody out there doesn't have the Stanley Parable, freaking get it.
10554169	10555370	It's on my list of things to check out.
10555450	10556030	I have it.
10556250	10557350	I bought it in the last sale.
10557471	10558771	It's just things to check out during this week.
10558911	10560591	I don't remember if I actually picked it up or not.
10560672	10561352	I know I want to.
10561392	10562292	I know I want to check it out.
10562392	10563172	It's 11 bucks right now.
10563472	10565933	Actdeft suggesting Dust and Elysian Tale.
10566353	10570515	And some folks in chat commenting, Loki, are you wrapping a present in the background?
10570555	10571535	Because we can hear it.
10572162	10572682	My wife is.
10573122	10573443	Oh, okay.
10574023	10574903	Hi, Nelly.
10574983	10576464	Merry Christmas to whoever.
10576704	10580486	You might just want to mute yourself locally on Skype like you when you're not talking just so we don't hear the rapping.
10580506	10581026	Sorry.
10581126	10581606	That's all right.
10582847	10585548	It takes some getting used to when you do it in person for so long.
10586007	10586327	All right.
10587689	10588890	Where else are we at?
10589450	10590511	That's it for that email, right?
10591232	10591892	That was the last email.
10591912	10592513	That's it for emails.
10592853	10596517	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future.
10596577	10601121	And hopefully we'll get some nice – like I would love to see two emails that counter each other back to back.
10601161	10602522	We need more of that in future weeks.
10602882	10603863	That's always hilarious.
10603883	10604484	Those are my favorite.
10605324	10629850	some other just some more comments from chat and this is just PC gaming in general really William Murderface saying don't forget Guild Wars 2 if you're looking for a different MMO experience I think they're running a promotion right now I got an email from them that might be directly through ArenaNet for that Cial says Reprisal is a good populist clone that's still being worked on did I say Actdeft's Dust and Elysian Tale if I didn't then I said it again I guess all right
10630450	10630950	Divekick.
10631150	10633111	I'd also say Duke Nukem.
10634051	10637672	Remember Duke Nukem 3D, I think, was down to two bucks, like the old school one.
10637752	10639113	And we have multiplayer and beta now.
10639253	10640953	It might be in the flash sale at 2am.
10641133	10642114	I know I'll be up checking.
10643174	10648235	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week, because we're mad, even though it's the holidays.
10648415	10649876	The holidays bring out the worst in us.
10666209	10667670	F you, Rob, because Crivello.
10669271	10688181	No, right now my voice is kind of going out, and I have stuff I have to do this week, and also I'm a little bit jealous that my computer hasn't been upgraded when Dan's was, but I understand our friend that was helping us out has become quite ill, and it's going around, so just feel better soon.
10689702	10690322	See you, George.
10691383	10695025	You're awesome for doing this for us, and thank you for helping us pick out bits for our computers.
10695305	10695986	Feel better, George.
10696627	10698349	We have some little banter on Twitter now and again.
10699250	10703996	By the way, I'm going to have like 50 bajillion USB ports on the front of my computer or something like that.
10704056	10704376	Nice.
10705598	10706179	I'll go next.
10706259	10709983	My FU of the week goes to... I think I pulled a muscle last night while I was sleeping because...
10710584	10713005	I was super drunk last night!
10731892	10740117	I didn't have a hangover today, and Alan did, so I will say thank you to whatever is out there watching over me for not giving me a hangover today.
10740137	10741458	Bless your hydration and your liver.
10741638	10742799	Yeah, try to teach me a lesson.
10742839	10745760	Yeah, I did have a bottle of water before I left the place.
10745780	10746501	That was probably smart.
10746621	10750123	I will tell everybody this, just a piece of advice.
10750803	10758488	If you take a B50 complex and drink a glass of water before you're going to have a night of frivolous drinking, frivol-o-drinking too, Mm-hmm.
10759108	10764017	You are less likely to have a hangover and also invest in ginger pills because they do help with nausea.
10768332	10796600	S2100 Matt in chat says we gotta get Grandpa on OLR actually it's funny you bring that up we are he offered yesterday to do a live show from San Francisco at his place and I actually think that's something we could swing because ironically enough Jason's in San Francisco right now so we just down the street for him so I'm thinking around the time that Loki's gonna be out because the baby's here that might be a good time for Jamie and I to get in the car go to San Francisco we might actually do that as long as I haven't started my job
10797710	10798170	So we'll see.
10799271	10806233	It is actually a possibility in OLR Roadshow because if we're in San Francisco, we might be able to get some really great guests in studio.
10806253	10807533	We know who else is going to be there.
10808613	10809293	Yeah, no, I know.
10809674	10812914	So it's on the list.
10812954	10813795	That's all I'm going to say.
10815295	10815975	Loki, your turn.
10816956	10823237	All right, I guess F you to my mouth because it's still a little bit sore from surgery.
10824098	10824738	Can you eat real food?
10824798	10825438	I can eat food now.
10827637	10830428	Alright, glad to hear you're getting better though Jason
10831087	10840011	FU to the stupid cough I still can't quite kick and has also seemed to want to be more prolific despite cough drops in the last 30 minutes, hours, something like that.
10840371	10844493	I'm sure all this talking is not exactly helping it terribly well, but you know, whatever.
10846074	10851756	FU to money, again, just kind of in general, but more specifically, GE Financial.
10852017	10858920	They're dumb and the fact that they make it so hard for me to be able to actually see bills and manage finances...
10859820	10860701	You're making it hard.
10861401	10865364	You're going against the ability for utilities to actually make things easier.
10865465	10867946	Credit, you know, debt planning, that kind of stuff.
10868007	10869508	GE Financial, FU.
10869668	10870849	FU.
10870989	10873110	Lastly, awkward moments in public.
10874111	10878274	I was at the post office and there were customers that decided to get into...
10879395	10882136	Not literally, but verbal fisticuffs with each other.
10882536	10890060	And it was insanely awkward, and I had to make sure that I didn't want to jump in and try to pacify it, because I would not have pacified it.
10890500	10893541	I wouldn't have done anything, but I would not have pacified it.
10893601	10894622	I just would have gotten involved.
10896663	10903789	There is inevitably a mental illness that spearheaded a large portion of this, which is unfortunate.
10904250	10905911	But the moment itself, F you.
10907913	10908413	All right.
10910035	10913397	Let us start to wrap up the show here with just a couple more stories.
10913437	10915219	And then we're going to open up the Skype line.
10915859	10920163	And yes, you can still call 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10920183	10921424	But we're not there just yet.
10921464	10923126	We have a couple more stories for you guys first.
10923186	10923426	Loki.
10924281	10951703	yes and since we talked about the VGX over the last few weeks the final numbers are in they had 1.1 million views which exceeded their expectations and they said there was a lot of great feedback that came out of it and sure there's people calling for the date and time of my suicide and this is Jeff Keeley but there were people who also said very constructive things about the show and um
10952967	10957388	So it sounds like that it was a success and they're planning on doing it next year as well.
10958468	10960949	They said people from 109 countries tuned in.
10962149	10969350	Average viewer spending 32 minutes watching it, which is funny because it's about the time I watched it, about 30 minutes.
10972131	10974231	So you were Joe Average in that case?
10975292	10975892	I guess so.
10975912	10977252	Is that your cat?
10978322	10979123	That is my cat.
10979183	10983189	She just got let out of because she was getting into all the rapping stuff.
10983209	10984852	It's going to be the locker in the middle bedroom.
10985152	10988998	And she comes out and does her cry and stuff.
10989699	10989919	Aww.
10991181	10993304	Yeah, she's a douchebag sometimes.
10994545	11001950	So it sounds like the VGX was really well rated so it probably is coming back next year despite anything we might have said that week it aired.
11002730	11005812	Maybe without Joel McHale this time would be my guess.
11006513	11011196	Or more like the version that was on TV which was totally edited and different but we'll see.
11011676	11022283	They should do like a Aisha Tyler or something like that because she's actually kind of into games and stuff and you know I think that would be pretty good and maybe you know
11022759	11024961	Maybe give some comedy lessons to Jeff there.
11052341	11054202	Well, they actually made a documentary about this.
11054222	11057664	And I seem to remember talking about this on a show before, that this documentary was in progress.
11058085	11064969	Well, the Canadian film production company, Fuel Industries, actually is going to this landfill to try to find all the cartridges.
11065049	11067010	Although, you're going to find a bunch of melted plastic.
11067090	11068151	Oh, whatever.
11068551	11078037	But anyway, this whole thing is going to happen from this film company, and they're actually going to release a documentary on Xbox on 2014.
11078077	11078157	Wow.
11079438	11080818	DarkSakura, you like documentaries?
11109366	11111067	I do, I actually watch quite a number of them.
11111728	11118032	In fact, yesterday I watched a whole series about the medieval attitude towards marriage, birth, and death.
11120233	11124076	And with the change of the Anglican Reformation.
11125697	11128619	Would they call that Romney documentary the biggest loser?
11130493	11130973	Oh, stop.
11131034	11134818	It's just called Red Entertainment said we didn't find shit in the documentary where we don't find shit.
11135139	11137902	You probably will find some shit, but not the shit you're looking for.
11137922	11139725	It'd be like when Geraldo opened that tomb.
11139845	11141087	I was just thinking that.
11142949	11144130	I was just thinking that.
11144551	11145773	Look, nothing.
11146454	11146694	Yeah.
11149756	11151497	Oh well.
11151557	11155120	It's going to be a big bomb and everyone's going to be like, yay, bomb.
11156100	11158582	That is it for the news.
11159383	11166347	We are about to go to the Skype line, but since I do have to free up the Skype line for the night, this is the part of the show where we're going to say goodbye to Loki.
11167488	11169590	Loki, thanks for being here on the show tonight.
11170110	11170590	Not a problem.
11171391	11175414	Do you have any final... Well, first I should ask, do you have any quick last minute stories for our listeners or...
11176021	11176821	Just one small one.
11176901	11178762	It's Grand Theft Auto 5 related.
11178822	11183884	There's going to be... Actually, it was kind of leaked out that there's going to be some Christmas DLC.
11184204	11196848	They've already started patching it in, and if you happen to be playing Grand Theft Auto Online, if you look up at the sky, you'll notice that some light snow is falling, and pretty soon that light snow is going to turn into heavy snow as we get towards Christmas.
11197469	11204231	So, full snow in Los Santos, and there's going to be some...
11205216	11205836	No, not really.
11205856	11207378	Just have a good holiday, everyone.
11224096	11224376	All right.
11224636	11228158	Well, thanks for being here tonight, Loki, and take care of yourself and best of luck.
11228198	11229379	And rub your wife's feet.
11229839	11230139	Yes.
11230299	11230900	Rub your wife's feet.
11230920	11231280	I already am.
11231300	11231940	She's sitting right here.
11232321	11232661	All right.
11233101	11233581	Hi, Nellie.
11233621	11234122	Bye, Nellie.
11234202	11234382	All right.
11234402	11234862	Bye, you guys.
11234902	11235202	Take care.
11235802	11236023	Bye.
11236183	11237443	All right.
11237543	11239024	Loki, I don't know if he'll pop in chat.
11239064	11240785	He might show up in chat a little later in the show.
11240825	11241165	We'll see.
11241566	11242606	I thought he was already in chat.
11242906	11243127	All right.
11243167	11245888	But in the meantime, Jamie's going to answer this call.
11246248	11246548	I am?
11246648	11248730	Yes, because Alan just brought dinner.
11248790	11249230	I want dinner.
11249470	11250911	So sorry about it.
11251491	11252812	Hey, this is OLR.
11252872	11253312	What's up?
11254993	11255914	Hey, this is Actdeft.
11256094	11256974	Hi, Actdeft.
11257675	11259296	Thank you for visiting my village.
11259476	11260997	I'm glad you still love Animal Crossing.
11262037	11263798	Well, I still play it on occasion.
11264259	11272143	Not as much as I did a few months ago, but I may pick it up again to do the rest of the stuff I haven't done.
11272724	11275005	I brought Big Dan into making a tent in my village.
11276621	11277341	Yeah, I saw it.
11277381	11278442	I saw the tent.
11278662	11282024	And I left Dan a present, too.
11282164	11283825	Well, a letter and a present.
11284885	11285666	So what's up tonight?
11286666	11291969	Well, a little follow-up to the email RossDLUT sent.
11293170	11302875	Basically, there's a lot of sites that sell or do bundles, sell games for cheap.
11304124	11306908	PRM, Steam Activated, and all that stuff.
11308990	11320505	There was a few mentioned in chat, like Indie Royale, that sell bundles for games that are recently developed or recently released.
11321323	11328969	They're pretty cool games and they're activated on Steam and they have also Viscera-activated games and DRM-free.
11330050	11340239	There's also another page I mentioned in chat earlier, Indiegala, that also sells DRM-free games.
11340519	11344723	I think right now they have Euro Truck Simulator 2.
11348747	11352155	They are free and steam activated for like pretty cheap like
11352796	11353116	Mm-hmm
11383237	11383677	How so?
11384758	11390821	Why is it that gaming websites in general tend to focus more on Steam than anything else?
11393123	11394723	Basically because it's the most popular.
11395704	11400707	It's really popular out there and there's millions maybe that use Steam.
11402448	11404709	And even that's pretty much that started it all.
11405630	11407951	So it's basically popularity.
11409136	11424550	There are many sites that cover deals and stuff that we all know, CheapAssGamer, and they hold their Twitter feed, and they post about deals and stuff from...
11424890	11434035	A lot of places, not only Steam, like Amazon, Green Man Gaming, that's also a pretty good site for deals, even cheaper than Steam and Amazon.
11435736	11446603	I got the Brave New World expansion for Civilization V for cheaper than Steam has it, so it's a pretty great site too, and they also sell DRM-free stuff.
11449265	11451607	But basically, it's all popularity.
11453389	11465460	And really, since all the games that are sold on all those sites are activated in Steam, so basically it's like, you already have it, so why not?
11467146	11467546	Fair enough.
11468307	11470888	I think also all the extra stuff Steam has to do.
11470928	11474831	I mean, building the achievements and the friend talks and everything, that's kind of smart too.
11475211	11483776	I mean, I realize like Desura has some of that and some of the other competitors, but I think that goes a long way too in making Steam a little more than just a store.
11484432	11494461	Not that I'm, you know, I understand that we should kind of, you know, tip a hat to everybody that's got a really great sale going on, although I don't think we could ever possibly cover every great sale in gaming.
11495162	11497284	But I think it is why people tend to focus on Steam.
11498124	11500607	So, anyway, Actdeft, before we let you go, any other thoughts?
11503077	11507042	There's another site that I recently discovered that's called Groupies.
11507923	11518054	G-R-O-U-P-E-W-E-S.com That also sells not only games, they also sell music.
11518835	11520618	and they have pretty good, great bundles.
11521079	11523322	So that's another one to check out.
11523422	11527348	Didn't they also host the MAGFest donation slash award drive?
11527408	11529371	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
11529391	11532275	They did the MAGFest bundle and I bought that.
11532575	11533637	It's a pretty great bundle.
11533976	11536598	Yeah, I mean, it's always a great time.
11537579	11543664	Every day is a good day for consumers because there's always so many new fantastic things.
11545205	11549409	And some of them specialize in ways that may align with your interests more.
11549569	11551271	So seek them out and support them.
11551571	11552872	That's all it boils down to.
11554778	11556699	All right, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
11556719	11557639	But thank you so much for the call.
11558540	11558860	Thank you.
11558920	11559560	Happy holidays.
11559781	11560421	All right, take care.
11560721	11561221	Happy holidays.
11561301	11563302	Bye.
11563322	11566764	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11567424	11570906	I'm going to try to pull up the Twitter here real quick while I'm in between bites of my dinner.
11571486	11572767	Oh, but we do have another call coming in.
11573047	11574468	So, Jason, you ready to answer this one?
11574488	11575148	I'm ready to answer this.
11575208	11575809	All right, you ready?
11576269	11577329	You fill that host role.
11577530	11578170	All right, here we go.
11578370	11582192	Another call on the line while I chow down on some sweet and sour chicken over here.
11582572	11583112	I will do so.
11583352	11583852	Hello, caller.
11583972	11584373	What's your name?
11584433	11585053	Who are you calling from?
11585393	11586093	Where are you calling from?
11586713	11587774	It's Ranma from Brooklyn.
11587814	11588094	What's up?
11588114	11590374	It's Ranma from that place on the opposite side of the U.S.
11590874	11591535	I sent you a card.
11592715	11593195	You got what?
11593775	11594516	I sent you a card.
11595276	11595636	Awesome.
11596116	11597837	You'll be getting your gift tomorrow.
11601474	11608817	Appropriate for the Christmas spirit, the holiday spirit, the non-dominational spirit, denominational as well.
11609197	11610198	Words are hard.
11610398	11613839	Some people like to be dominated.
11614539	11615620	Robby, tell us something.
11616420	11617040	What's up, Romna?
11617881	11620422	Okay, a couple of things I want to cover.
11620542	11621762	I'm getting the hell up on out of here.
11621922	11626464	Now, the whole PAX Diversity Lounge thing, I'm not happy.
11628393	11634066	This does not come as any bit of a surprise but what's your take on it in addition to what we covered previously?
11635132	11648323	As someone who's gone to cons for years and also staffs conventions as well, this whole diversity lounge thing, I just feel it's not the responsibility of the convention to have these lounges set up.
11649103	11653166	If this should be done, let somebody else come in and handle it.
11653246	11655808	Let the con have someone to monitor.
11656629	11657350	And that's just it.
11657830	11660392	They shouldn't be dictating how things should go.
11660672	11660932	Because...
11661853	11665456	I just see nothing but bad juju coming out of this.
11665717	11670361	Especially considering the source of the drama is the con organizers themselves.
11671462	11677187	Yeah, I personally, I give them more or less a pass because I'm very understanding about various things.
11677227	11681251	Some people feel that I shouldn't, but it's my thought train.
11681291	11682732	It's my logic that, you know.
11686002	11691705	But you are of the opinion that this is something that should exist, just executed slightly differently.
11692686	11697149	Yeah, because I don't know if you noticed, but there's been a lot of crazy shit going on with conventions.
11697189	11704534	I mean, like, there was one con where a girl was sexually assaulted, and the convention just dropped the entire ball about that.
11705054	11706435	Oh, they sucked.
11706915	11708656	I read that and was so pissed off.
11709257	11713579	Yes, and there are con staffers I speak to that run other conventions...
11714815	11721683	about a third of them say that the con's not at fault here and that really started a shitstorm but that's for another time
11722574	11725837	And this isn't even just a convention thing in the strictest sense.
11725997	11744192	Obviously, that's where the biggest news and availability comes out because this is a massive group of people and things of this nature can, unfortunately, get caught in not even the noise but also the news and that these little things have to really bubble up to become a big deal.
11744212	11744232	I...
11746735	11757956	is this something I've never been to a con that has something like that there will be panels but has there ever been a fixed presence in any con you've been to to address these issues
11759111	11759871	Not at all.
11760271	11765673	The closest I've been to a convention where we had something like this was Otakon years ago.
11766214	11769975	We had what was called the Black Cosplayers Social Thread.
11770175	11773856	The point of this was for a bunch of black cosplayers to get together and hang out.
11773876	11776057	It says, we don't see each other.
11776337	11782859	But we kept saying, it's for everyone to join, but it's just for us to get together and hang out, you know, because we don't see each other.
11783760	11787341	That was going good for a couple of years until somebody got offended and started the...
11788061	11795886	I'm kind of surprised that there was another list of minorities, although I obviously get a fair amount of the reference in that last group that you just mentioned.
11812225	11816949	Yeah, it was supposed to be a joke to prove that everybody was being ridiculous about it.
11817229	11820511	It was more like just to get together and have a good time.
11820531	11823213	This was something that we were planning more or less.
11823273	11830619	Now, if the con itself had gotten involved, it probably would have gotten a hell of a lot worse before all this even happened.
11831659	11835122	Yours had a theme but not an exclusion, not a restriction.
11835772	11836072	Right.
11836293	11843860	Now, the whole diversity, I see the similarities, but I just see still it's going to cause a problem.
11846242	11848664	It's like I said on a friend's Facebook.
11849885	11851086	They're diversifying everything.
11851266	11860215	That means us folk, we're going to be at the back of the convention center on dial-up while everybody else is going to be at the front of the convention center on shitty Wi-Fi.
11862348	11885593	uh despite despite the difference in mediums still makes a pretty uh pretty significant difference and yeah it's a it's a as we said it's only creating a prejudice zone because that whatever people feel that they'll be there you know it will only be these individuals there in the first place in large part anything else on your mind
11887173	11888395	A couple more things.
11888475	11893123	I want to agree with DarkSakura about the whole DDR and exercise thing because I did that for a while.
11893483	11896408	DDR, four times a day, took vitamins.
11896428	11898853	I ended up dropping like 20 pounds, so I dislocated my knee.
11899801	11911545	Yeah, well, when I first, the first DDR that Dan ever bought me, the first one I physically owned that wasn't a burn was Second Mix on Dreamcast.
11912065	11925369	And over that summer, since my birthday in April, I dropped something like 10 to 15 pounds and completely, I had had some torn tendons in my foot from college in Alabama and completely healed my foot.
11926289	11926729	Gotcha.
11927270	11932733	So, I mean, there is such a thing as overdoing and pushing yourself a bit too hard.
11935015	11937116	I think with any exercise, one needs to be careful.
11937757	11939518	Clearly, as it was in your case, too.
11940198	11944801	Well, I dislocated my knee for other reasons, but... So, DDR is safe!
11945382	11946563	Yeah, yeah.
11946923	11948504	I banged my head on the monitor once.
11949224	11949685	Well, I'm sorry.
11949705	11950685	I didn't mean to overstep you.
11950745	11951106	I'm sorry.
11951566	11951706	Mm-hmm.
11952130	11952710	Go ahead, you.
11953270	11953551	Okay.
11953991	11957772	When I got out of the hospital, my first thought was, well, fuck, can I play DDR again?
11957792	11959513	That was the first thing that came to mind.
11960193	11960453	Yep.
11961014	11970457	There was one time, and Rob, I think you were there, when I got dizzy playing, at the time I was on sevens, and I slipped forward and hit my head on the machine.
11970858	11971878	I think I was there.
11972018	11974039	And then I got up and finished it.
11974099	11975119	That was scary, though.
11975640	11977700	I had this big red welt on my forehead.
11977800	11978621	That was pretty fun, though.
11978721	11978921	Yeah.
11979441	11983344	I mean, I can look back at it and laugh now, and I wasn't scared because I was focused on playing.
11983944	11985645	But everyone else was like, oh, my God.
11986046	11987266	Yeah, scary.
11987787	11992530	All right, well, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can probably take one more call and then wrap up for the night.
11992550	11993290	But thanks for calling.
11993670	11995492	All right, before I go, I'm just going to say this.
11996612	12002436	For allowing Anime Jam Session on VOG, for helping us out and all the good stuff, I have here a shot of...
12004277	12004838	of Sake.
12004858	12009020	I just want to say on behalf of Anime Jam Session to OLR, thanks for everything.
12009260	12011061	Happy holidays and happy new year.
12011261	12013582	Well, I've got a glass of water.
12013642	12016744	Jason has a Pepsi Wild Cherry and DarkSakura has her iPhone.
12016864	12017825	We're toasting right now.
12017885	12018305	There you go.
12018385	12018645	Toast.
12018665	12022267	And I'm going to send Jamie a picture of the sake that I took a shot out of.
12022407	12022788	Nice.
12022988	12023248	Okay.
12023408	12023628	All right.
12023668	12024148	Take care, buddy.
12024168	12024569	Have a good one.
12025129	12025489	You too.
12025649	12025929	All right.
12025969	12026169	Bye.
12027350	12029771	Well, I am done shoving Chinese food down my throat.
12029811	12031231	It was really good, just saying.
12031251	12031911	It smelled good.
12031971	12032611	I'm sorry.
12032991	12034452	I feel so rude eating in front of you guys.
12034472	12038873	Well, no, you offered, and I said no, and then I realized all I had today was a salad and some cheese.
12038913	12040233	You realized the mistake you made.
12040293	12040953	That's all right.
12041033	12043234	It was just I couldn't see anything that wasn't sugary.
12043454	12044214	All right.
12044274	12047555	Since I am done eating, I will take this last call.
12047595	12048495	Hi, you're on Orange Sausage Radio.
12048515	12048855	Who's this?
12049415	12050815	Hey, this is Brad from PodCulture.
12050855	12052496	Hey, Brad from PodCulture.
12052536	12053076	How you doing?
12053667	12058691	DarkSakura talking about my avatar there Alright, settle down so Brad can get his thought out What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
12077465	12088234	Well, y'all don't talk too much about mobile games, but I had to call in and tell you about a mobile game that's kind of become crack for Christina and I here of late.
12089395	12092738	It's Doctor Who Legacy, and it's on iOS and Android.
12093278	12094839	Yeah, you told me about that.
12094859	12096160	I need to find this.
12096681	12101845	It's pretty much a bejeweled clone, but they got all kinds of little unlocks and...
12102571	12106393	You know, you can unlock different characters and costumes and levels and all that kind of crap.
12106753	12112737	And there's just something that makes it like crack.
12113077	12114217	You can't stop playing it.
12114478	12115198	It's the Doctor.
12116279	12120781	You know what's interesting, though, is that usually those Doctor Who games don't really get very good reviews.
12120821	12122722	Like, weren't there some on, like, the DS or whatever?
12123282	12125304	Yeah, well, there was one on DS.
12125324	12126484	There was a Top Trumps game.
12126664	12128966	Yeah, Top Trumps, and that was all right.
12129086	12130406	Someone sent it to me.
12131803	12135384	There was one that was on PSN that was kind of bad.
12136204	12138665	Like in the Eternity Clock or something, I think, of what it was.
12138685	12140706	The rules weren't so great.
12140746	12145187	But this one, if you like Bejeweled or those kind of games, and you like Doctor Who, it's perfect.
12146148	12148989	I had the Mazes of Time game somewhere.
12149609	12152650	And that was kind of a neat little partner puzzle-solving game.
12153370	12155191	That one, the controls were god-awful.
12155491	12156211	I couldn't stand it.
12156556	12160419	I didn't mind it that much, and someone had gifted it to me.
12161340	12164462	So I really enjoyed it, but I didn't play very far at it.
12165303	12167084	Ooh, this has Clara, so I'm definitely downloading it.
12167525	12179674	Oh yeah, and right now they have an advent calendar type of thing where they release a code a day or a different level a day all throughout the holidays, and the one that came out today was for Sarah Jane.
12180515	12181315	I love Sarah Jane!
12181355	12181996	She's my favorite.
12182557	12183657	Yeah, and it's neat.
12183737	12184497	It's a free game.
12185218	12191059	Although there are, of course, in-app purchases where you can buy crystals and crap to level up a little faster.
12191139	12192479	But you don't have to pay a cent for it.
12193059	12202561	And the developer's been really good at communication because I've had a couple of issues where I've had to email them twice and they've responded really fast within hours.
12203602	12204342	Well, that's cool.
12204622	12205942	Yeah, well, I'm actually downloading it now.
12206722	12208162	Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
12208683	12210283	It's worth checking out, especially for free.
12211158	12216963	And I'm fairly addicted to Bejeweled on my phone, so maybe this will fill in my addiction.
12217644	12226632	Well, I don't mind at all talking about mobile phone games here on the show, and especially one that I kind of think would be of interest to nerds out there.
12226712	12232217	I think there's probably a lot of people out there that not only like video games, but like their Doctor Who as well, so...
12233257	12239239	Yeah, I just wanted to call in and mention that in case folks hadn't heard about it and check it out.
12239379	12240519	I do have to ask.
12241039	12241279	Okay.
12241459	12242880	Did you watch Day of the Doctor?
12243580	12245260	Oh yeah, I went to the theater and saw it.
12245620	12248121	Did you get the sniffles at the end?
12250182	12256183	I was a little disappointed that we didn't see the whole... You talking about with John Hurt?
12256723	12257424	No, no, no, no, no.
12257724	12258964	I'm talking about with Curator.
12259557	12260698	Night of the Doctor
12274984	12276765	Yeah, that was pretty good, too, because I love Paul McGann.
12277086	12281068	On a scale of 1 to 10, how excited are you for the Christmas episode?
12282009	12285611	Oh, well, anything that brings me more Clara is a pin.
12286331	12287812	Anything that gets rid of Matt Smith.
12287933	12293076	I mean, hey, there's a reason we named the cat Clara.
12293416	12299338	I actually like Matt Smith's Doctor, but I love David Tennant, but nobody tops Tom Baker.
12299498	12302899	I don't even really watch the show, but Peter Capaldi looks very interesting.
12302959	12304700	Oh, he's going to be a great Doctor.
12305300	12310542	Oh, yeah, he's going to be great, and the little cameo he had in the anniversary special was awesome.
12310702	12311642	Oh, yeah, that was great.
12312442	12316904	Brad, before we let you go, do you want to give a quick plug for this week's Pod Culture coming up tomorrow on VOG?
12317704	12320205	Well, it's just the second half of our...
12323959	12324559	Thanks for watching!
12344654	12347295	Ooh, I can't wait to hear it because I love me some guilty pleasure movies.
12347655	12354137	Alright, of course, lots of great shows all about television and movies throughout the world on Mondays here at the Voice Geeks Network.
12354497	12363820	Critical Myth at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern, British Invaders at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, and Pod Culture with Brad right here at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
12363880	12366321	Brad, thanks so much for the call and keep on gaming.
12366341	12367521	Alright, later guys.
12367561	12367721	Later.
12368564	12369905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
12392722	12393343	You should have seen her.
12393483	12396386	Grandpa was over here yesterday and I brought her out to say hi.
12396546	12397487	Oh, she was not happy.
12398127	12398408	I bet.
12398428	12398928	Not happy.
12399449	12404574	No, I have a midnight home and Little Miss has been quite the affection whore today.
12405335	12409939	Oh, I've got the picture in my email of Ranma's sake.
12410059	12410400	Oh, yeah?
12411000	12412442	But you don't do shots of sake.
12412502	12413663	You heat it and you sip it.
12413843	12414384	Okay.
12416065	12417346	It's taking forever to load.
12437444	12454373	But his tweet said, gonna have to disagree with OLR, Sky, DarkSakura There were, are, a lot of military service members on WoW, many with clearances Don't worry, I still love you guys I saw that too Yeah, I can't think that we would have come out here and said, oh, military people don't play WoW
12454833	12475731	but maybe we had said something along the lines of you know that there isn't sensitive or sensitive people or something in there and that is a good counterpoint that hell yeah there's a lot of service members that play WoW and a lot of MMOs I mean every MMO I've ever played I meet service people in there I think it's a great way for them to have some fun and let off some steam and keep in touch
12478933	12484897	Thank you for reminding me to say thank you to all of our service people, especially those that are having to spend the holidays overseas right now.
12484997	12485878	Thank you for your service.
12486378	12489380	I think there's probably several that listen to this program, so thank you all.
12491001	12500107	Let me go to a tweet from Dave Falcon, who tweeted us saying, The Smithsonian Museum of American Art started collecting video games as pieces of art for museum display.
12500547	12505691	That's pretty cool, and he links us to a story from ABC7 News, and I'm trying to bring it up here.
12506592	12518994	the Smithsonian American Art Museum is collecting video games for its permanent collection as part of an ongoing commitment to study and preserve such games as an artistic medium now I thought that the Smithsonian already had a room for this
12521460	12523341	or maybe I'm confusing it with another museum.
12523962	12524822	Maybe it's MoMA.
12525422	12526123	Maybe it could be.
12526143	12532206	I might be, but I swear somebody showed me like a room, and I thought it was a Smithsonian, but maybe not.
12532607	12539110	But regardless, they've acquired the 2009 game Flower and the Halo 2600.
12540491	12566561	which was the Halo hack that was done or actually it wasn't really a hack it was like a homebrew game that was done a few years ago it's kind of a neat little choice for inclusion but I think that's very cool to show like a new game for an old console is pretty cool like that a lot so yeah hey I think that's great to preserve that stuff as art I think it's just a matter of time before we have like a video game hall of fame the Metreon tried to do something like that but then they went kaput
12566966	12574309	Well remember too though there was that touring gallery that was a video game art and I've got a couple books actually at home.
12576170	12581753	Dark Tetsuya says the Smithsonian had that exhibit so I guess this is more of a permanent installation there so that's pretty cool.
12582233	12582433	All right.
12582473	12583334	That is going to do it, though.
12583354	12586416	We got to wrap up the show because we're almost to 1 a.m.
12586456	12587016	on the East Coast.
12587036	12587917	So we really have to wrap up.
12588257	12589678	So sorry to the tweets I didn't get to.
12589758	12593300	But if you have something for next week, please consider sending us an email, a tweet, or what have you.
12593701	12596983	Mailbag at orange.radio.com or twitter.com slash OLR.
12597323	12600125	But it is that time for us to go around and wrap up for the night.
12601205	12603347	Jason, thank you as always for being here throughout the month.
12604107	12606589	Glad we could have you participate with some stories tonight.
12606649	12607369	Hope you had a good time.
12607489	12608990	Not the first, won't be the last.
12609110	12609791	Won't be the last.
12609831	12610271	We'll see you.
12610331	12614334	And it sounds like, by the way, I don't want to give too much away, but I've been doing some texting.
12614794	12618957	The OLR show in San Francisco, it's going to happen sooner rather than later.
12619257	12621478	Well, that will be one convenient Sunday for me.
12621618	12623659	Yeah, and it will be a Sunday when you're here.
12623780	12628002	So we have a weekend targeted, and I've been talking to Grandpa, so I think it's going to happen.
12628382	12630244	So I will give you guys more details next week.
12630264	12632565	I could give you guys a tour of my office while we're there.
12632625	12633165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
12651235	12655558	10 people either as guests or including the hosts.
12656398	12661280	We could probably host it in my office too because we have ways of making this happen.
12661560	12662261	We'll think of something.
12662701	12664082	We'll have fun for a week.
12664162	12664282	Ideas.
12666923	12670184	Keep in mind, Loki's not going to be available that week, so we can't have too much fun without him.
12670685	12671785	Can't have too much fun without him.
12671865	12677227	There's also possibilities for bringing him on Skype and having his video on there, too.
12677327	12677787	That's true.
12677847	12679288	These are not impossibilities.
12679428	12679868	We'll see.
12680008	12680288	All right.
12680709	12683129	Bobby Blackwolf wants to say, can I come?
12683189	12683790	Of course you can.
12683810	12684370	Of course you can.
12684490	12690732	But don't you want to try to convince Dark Sakura to come to DragonCon and Loki to come to DragonCon so we can have an OLR DragonCon show?
12690752	12691553	Because that would be even better.
12692213	12692493	All right.
12693514	12694315	DarkSakura.
12694775	12695055	Oh, wait.
12695155	12696256	Jason, I got to get your final thought.
12696276	12697117	What's your final thought for the night?
12697137	12697497	Stupid cough.
12697977	12698998	All right.
12699358	12702340	My final thought is thank you, Alan, for getting Chinese food.
12702560	12703341	It was really good.
12703501	12705923	Like, usually that place is kind of so-so, but tonight was really good.
12705943	12708825	You need to tell Alan about you guys' present that I got you.
12708945	12709906	I ran in there during the break.
12710286	12718131	Which I'm hoping that Loki and Jason's presents arrive very soon because I thought they were cool.
12720273	12721213	Your final thought tonight, miss?
12721253	12722734	I want rotisserie chicken for dinner.
12723094	12724795	I'm going to go to Walmart and buy a chicken.
12724815	12725455	Yummy.
12726516	12726876	All right.
12727176	12728957	Have you had the rotisserie chickens at freaking Walmart?
12729617	12730257	Not at Walmart.
12730277	12731238	They're fucking amazing.
12731518	12731818	Really?
12731978	12732578	From Walmart?
12732919	12733159	Yes.
12733819	12737601	Because they're the same ones that they're almost just like the ones from Costco.
12738281	12738721	So good.
12738842	12741243	I would have thought maybe like Boston Market or something.
12741303	12741623	But anyway.
12742103	12744424	Alright, that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
12744744	12746364	Have a great holiday, you guys.
12746664	12751166	Whatever it is you celebrate, we will be back here to do it all again for the last show of the year.
12751286	12755327	So you know we're going to be talking games of the year, stories of the year.
12755507	12757487	Yep, we got to have ourselves one of those shows.
12757907	12760128	But a lot can happen in seven days, y'all.
12760648	12765109	So we'll check in with the gaming news in seven more days here at Orange Lounge Radio.
12765169	12766230	Have a great week, everybody.
12766450	12767770	Is that seven days?
12767850	12768750	Seven days.
12769271	12770071	Seven days.
12770171	12770711	Good night, everybody.
12771482	12772403	Thank you for watching.
12801469	12802189	See you next week.
