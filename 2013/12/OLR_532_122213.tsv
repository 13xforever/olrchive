7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, we're gonna take it a little bit easier. Christmas is right around the corner and we're all getting presents from Nintendo, Rockstar, LucasArts, and Oretail. Help us unwrap all the goodness contained within this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this December the 22nd, 2013, episode number 532.
45000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and gamer etc. etc. with my co-hosts. Say hello for stuff to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	58000	I'm wearing my Charlie the Unicorn shirt tonight.
58000	60000	Shun the non-believer!
60000	61000	Well, you see what it says on the back?
61000	64000	What is it? It's the magical amulet. I don't remember that one.
64000	66000	The vortex out of his back?
66000	68000	It's the magical amulet, Charlie!
68000	70000	It's literally been like two years since I've been on YouTube.
70000	74000	I just watched it Friday because Julian likes Charlie the Unicorn.
74000	76000	Julian, by the way, is a six-year-old. Seven-year-old?
76000	78000	Six. Six and a half.
78000	80000	And you're welcome, Becky, if you're listening.
82000	84000	So, how are things going for you?
84000	93000	Actually, I am pretty happy today. I am officially down one whole jean size since I started my exercise and fitness program.
93000	97000	You have been on quite the little weight loss quest and you've been very successful in that.
97000	103000	Well, the numbers on the scale don't matter to me as much as the inches I've gone down.
103000	108000	Sure, it's one thing to see the numbers on the scale, it's another to put on a pair of pants that used to not fit and then they do.
108000	110000	Well, because I'm also doing a lot of weight lifting.
110000	114000	And the first thing that happens when you lift weights is you actually do gain weight.
114000	122000	But muscle burns more, it boosts your metabolism more. I have to eat a lot more, which is great because I love to eat.
122000	123000	Who doesn't?
123000	127000	I actually had to increase my caloric intake by 200 calories.
127000	134000	Who doesn't? You know, my work holiday party went out for spaghetti and I was like, I can't think of a better food this time of year. Spaghetti is the best.
135000	142000	Well, anyway, I actually just weighed in today and I have lost 21 pounds since the beginning of October.
142000	143000	Congrats.
143000	146000	And I have lost roughly about two to three inches all around.
146000	147000	Great.
147000	151000	And I'm down a jean size and I'm going to start doing DDR once a week again.
151000	157000	So you were posting in the VOG forums about this stuff trying to get others to join you or whatever, right?
157000	166000	I have an account on Nerd Fitness and I linked my account on the VOG forums, but I would actually, because people coming on the new year really think I'm going to do it this time.
166000	170000	And then they go, no. Well, I am here to be everybody's life coach.
170000	173000	I actually want to do something with everybody.
173000	175000	Don't worry. Jamie will fix it.
175000	179000	Work harder. Lift more. Eat less.
179000	191000	I actually really would like to encourage and the whole reason I'm not doing this for the weight or anything, even though that was part of it, what I'm doing this for is because I actually feel a lot better.
191000	198000	I have a lot more energy. I don't have as bad fatigue problems as I used to. I don't get sick as often.
198000	210000	Since this is a video game show and you mentioned that you wanted to pick up a DDR habit again once a week, do you believe that the extra gaming and the exercise, the fitness gaming and all that, do you believe that that really can help a person turn around?
210000	217000	I do. And I'm going to tell you why DDR, I think, is better. Because I've been studying, most of the time I do weightlifting, right?
217000	224000	But there's another thing that they talk about that's called high intensity interval training, which is pretty much what DDR kind of is.
224000	229000	Of course, if you don't know what DDR is, Dance Dance Revolution, that game with the arrows and the floor mat.
229000	239000	The whole point is to push your hardest limit for like a minute and then you spend two minutes doing it at a more normal pace.
239000	245000	So in this case, it would be starting off with a nine footer, doing two medium or easy songs.
245000	249000	But it would still be important that you're still kind of like walking in between your songs and kind of keeping it going.
249000	256000	The other point is that if you are the one playing the game and you have a three or four song game, your first one is going to be your hard one.
256000	261000	Your next three are going to be your cooldowns. You do another game, hard one, three cooldowns.
261000	268000	So that way you're getting your heart rate up for that high interval and then you're relaxing because the human body is meant to function.
268000	275000	We're not meant to run and do long distance and do endurance things. We're meant to GTFO when there's an animal trying to bite us in the ass.
276000	284000	So we're built for fight or flight. So playing DDR, and I was thinking about this, it was like this light bulb moment.
284000	288000	Playing DDR is high interval and high intensity interval training.
288000	295000	You do, you know, you play five games of DDR, you've done 25 minutes of exercise, roughly.
295000	297000	DDR itself is kind of on its way out though.
297000	299000	But there's still everywhere.
299000	303000	I know we have a lot of longtime Bimani fans that it pains to hear that, but let's be real y'all.
303000	309000	It's not what it used to be. So, I mean, you just plan on playing the old versions or, you know, there's, yeah, you're right.
309000	311000	There's still arcade machines in many places.
311000	316000	I mean, you can play the old versions at home. You know, I'm actually planning on modding a new dance pad again.
316000	322000	But I mean, I'd like to get to the arcade and get friends together and try to recapture some of the old fun, you know.
322000	329000	But I think in, in general, it's finding your exercise where you enjoy it.
329000	333000	Because, I mean, the reason why I like lifting weights is I like feeling stronger.
333000	340000	I like being five foot two and being able to lift an 80 pound weight over my head.
340000	344000	That's just, and my goal is by my birthday of lifting 120 pounds.
344000	347000	Because soon that'll be a person that you can lift over your head and throw.
347000	351000	Exactly. I mean, I can get an 80 pound weight over my head. It's still work.
351000	355000	But my goal is that by my birthday in April, I want to be deadlifting 120 pounds.
355000	357000	You should be able to pick up Julian at this point, right?
358000	361000	We went to the park. I babysat him on Friday.
361000	362000	I got to move on. Hurry, hurry.
362000	367000	But I carried him over my head and was like throwing him into the sand pit and everything.
367000	369000	And I was in it, but it actually occurred to me.
369000	371000	You are named after the Bionic Woman after all.
371000	374000	This kid has gotten lighter to me because I have gotten stronger.
374000	375000	Nice. All right.
375000	376000	I didn't mean to go off on it.
376000	379000	No, that's okay. I don't really have much of a kickoff topic tonight. So this is fun.
379000	381000	We can have a little extended hellos with everybody.
381000	385000	But we do want to move on and introduce our other co-host who's been sitting there patiently waiting to be introduced.
385000	388000	Joining us via Skype tonight, everybody, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
388000	390000	Yes, I'm at home.
390000	391000	Hey, how you doing, Loki?
391000	393000	I'm doing fine.
393000	395000	You were too lazy to come to the show tonight.
395000	397000	You were going to stay home and gain weight.
397000	398000	No, I'm just kidding. Of course I'm kidding.
398000	403000	Guys, Loki's going to be joining us over Skype for the next few weeks.
403000	406000	And, Loki, do you want to elaborate on our special little arrangement?
406000	409000	Oh, yeah. It's basically my wife.
409000	413000	We're getting very close to the end of her pregnancy.
413000	422000	And so because third pregnancies can happen a lot quicker than the previous ones, I have to be ready to go.
422000	430000	So it's easier if I'm at home versus 15 minutes away to be able to get to wherever I need to go.
430000	436000	I mean, not that I will probably have to do that, but you just have to be prepared.
436000	439000	Right, yeah. You never know. I mean, when the baby's coming, the baby's coming.
439000	442000	You may have to leave mid-show and then we'll just deal with it. It is what it is.
442000	444000	You might end up having to deliver.
444000	449000	Well, I was joking with you before we went live tonight. I was kind of hoping a little bit that,
449000	455000	oh, maybe you would get a Christmas baby or a New Year's baby or have that baby in the newspaper.
455000	459000	First baby born in 2014 and that whole type of thing. And you were like, no.
459000	466000	That's probably not going to happen. She's due at the end of January, but he's measuring two weeks ahead.
466000	473000	And I think Josh was born at 37 weeks. So it's probably going to be the first or second week in January.
473000	477000	I think she's saying maybe two more weeks and he'll be born.
477000	482000	Well, you're being an awful, as they say in chat room. Of course, we do tape live every Sunday night
482000	487000	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
487000	491000	And you can join us and chat if you are listening live at live.vognetwork.com.
491000	498000	Travis Donovan, our buddy from Under Sedation Live, kicking off Loki Baby Watch 2013, dun-dun-dun.
498000	503000	Although act-def corrects him and says it could be 2014. So 2013 to 2014.
503000	507000	And we already have the name picked out, although I can't say what it is yet.
507000	512000	But the middle name does kind of tie into a video game.
512000	516000	A video game I don't play, but it's still a video game.
516000	517000	Interesting.
517000	524000	She asked me, she's all, so how should we spell that? And so I spelled it out very specifically to be like the video game.
524000	527000	So StriderHearYou is the middle name.
527000	534000	Alan Alchemy in our chat room, I love this. Alan Alchemy says Nellie Control, that's the wife of course, Nellie Control, Loki now.
534000	541000	The baby is here. LOLJK, I needed you to get off Skype. I can't handle your Nintendo rants when they're happening where I can hear them.
541000	543000	Now go get me Chipotle.
544000	546000	Odds of that happening?
548000	550000	Pretty slim.
550000	556000	She's out of the house until 8 o'clock. That's usually, she goes to her mom's house and takes Josh with her.
556000	560000	I have at least a couple hours with them gone.
560000	568000	There you go. So the thing is though, of course, I think part of the charm of Orange Lounge Radio and the way we've done things for the past,
568000	574000	you know, what year are we on now? 12? Is next year year 12? I lost count. I've literally lost count.
574000	575000	June it will be 12.
575000	586000	Okay, next year. 2014 is year 12. So we've been on the air about 12 years and I think part of the charm of the show and part of what makes our show a little different is the fact that we're all in the same room, usually.
586000	592000	And, you know, I realize there's 11 billion other podcasts that tape over Skype and do a great job over Skype.
592000	596000	Shit, my other show, Hoard House, done over Skype and we have a great time over there.
596000	604000	But, you know, when it comes down to, alright, well, are we going to force everybody to be in the same room and make Loki take a month off from the show?
604000	608000	Or are we going to have him on Skype? I choose having him on Skype.
608000	617000	So we'll deal with the Skype thing and have a little bit of a different chemistry over the next few weeks while we wait for Loki baby number 2 to be on the way.
617000	624000	And I had kitty cam going but we had to shut off because of bandwidth reasons. She's sleeping anyway, so.
624000	628000	Yes, there was kitty cam earlier. We might do some type of cam in the coming weeks.
628000	635000	I'm hoping there's going to be a new cable modem in studio in the coming weeks and then we can look at maybe pumping out a little more with the bandwidth.
635000	642000	But since we had some drops from live listeners in the past couple weeks, I gotta watch what's going in and out, so.
642000	650000	Alright, but yeah, so Loki will be joining us over Skype but it'll still be the same old same old, him doing his stories and talking about his gaming week in a moment.
650000	659000	But first, I have to introduce here in studio, he hasn't gone anywhere, well he wasn't here last week, but he's been spending the majority of the holidays here with us at Orange Songs Radio.
659000	663000	Say hello to the voice of the show, Mr. Jason. VX Jason XV XYZ Element OP.
663000	664000	I made it.
664000	665000	You made it.
665000	666000	I finally made it back.
666000	667000	How you doing?
667000	669000	I am doing so much better than this time last week.
669000	671000	Well you had that same plague that knocked a lot of us out.
672000	679000	Yeah, it was the Saturday prior to the show, no, that's impossible, I would have missed Sunday.
679000	681000	Saturday was the worst of the two.
681000	689000	Sunday I actually felt okay, but considering that we're jam-packed around this table when all four of us are here, I said, you know, whatever.
689000	697000	I'm ancillary and as much as I want to contribute, I'll pass because my voice was notably worse as well.
697000	698000	I'm surprised.
698000	700000	You can kindly hear it in last week's intro.
700000	705000	Now that I've told you that, go back and listen to last week's intro and you'll hear it. You probably didn't notice.
705000	712000	I pushed really hard to make sure it was clean the whole time, but the whole rest of the day, just my voice disappeared and that was that.
712000	717000	You know, I was sick on last week's show. I'm pretty sure I voiced that openly during the show last week.
717000	724000	And what the weird thing is though, I was really sick like Friday, Saturday, and then I was feeling a lot better Sunday and I'm like, finally, I'm on the other side of this.
724000	726000	But come Monday, oh my God, snacks.
726000	732000	It's almost like I had two colds or something because then Monday, Tuesday, I felt like crap and I feel great again.
732000	739000	I actually wound up, it's funny because I actually wanted to watch the show, but many of the live chatters may have noticed that I also didn't participate.
739000	745000	And that would be because I wound up being on the phone for 10 hours with a customer.
745000	751000	I was on the phone from six in the evening until four in the morning or something like that.
751000	753000	It was kind of a crazy night.
753000	755000	But it wasn't like your angry customer.
755000	757000	No, not even a little bit.
757000	767000	And as I got off the phone, he was also lauding my efforts, which, you know, when you're on that almost euphoric high of, this issue's finally over.
767000	775000	And the fact that any customer can thank you profusely, it's a wonderful feeling.
775000	782000	So, you know, I mentioned this on a previous episode of the show, but you've been hard at work on our latest endeavor into putting the shows on YouTube.
782000	786000	I have been trying to expand our audience a little more. And once again, thank you for that.
786000	794000	And you've been doing, I noticed you've been doing a little more and I realize there's a lot going on with YouTube, especially with gaming.
794000	797000	And we'll get into that a little later in the news. And I'm sure y'all know what I'm talking about.
797000	804000	But for the time being, we're just, you know, we're still putting our videos on YouTube, just like, you know, we have been.
804000	809000	And you've been, I notice every week you turn it up a little bit. You have something new to put in there every week.
809000	820000	I decided to take this on because I wanted more than just a static image. And I also really have been wanting to pick up these skills.
820000	827000	So what better way than putting these two together? I haven't gotten terribly crazy.
827000	833000	Last week's 531's edits were, I did a silly little thing with the cover art for the intro.
834000	839000	The gaming week has been there for the last two or three episodes. The classic game of the week, rather.
839000	844000	The video that we played in studio has been on stream for the past three episodes, I think.
844000	853000	The two newer things that I did this time are that when we were having, when you three were having this discussion about me last week,
853000	859000	I put a little heart, put a little heart in the empty space in the top right hand side.
859000	863000	Little easter eggs. Just fun, tiny little thing. Left it up there for about ten seconds.
863000	872000	But what I'm also doing is I'm also putting the fortune cookie, a little clip of the fortune cookie of the week as the end of the video.
872000	881000	While the outro is playing, I put a clip of the fortune cookie message of the day there so that we can start linking and have that reference for visitors as well.
881000	885000	Let me explain what that is real quick because we have to remember there's a large base there.
885000	891000	The podcast listeners are like, what's a fortune cookie? Remember, we have a huge audience that isn't here live.
891000	893000	I mention it sometimes.
893000	896000	Well, not huge. Let's not kid ourselves.
896000	900000	We have one sizable person who tells us the podcast.
900000	903000	There's a good chunk of listeners who are just on the podcast.
903000	912000	And so what happens is that because we're part of a live radio network, VOG network, we're still kind of on air, so to speak, even when the show is done.
912000	918000	So usually we sign out a little bit with, okay, so we're going to pull the plug now and go back to the music feed.
918000	920000	But here's our last little goodbye.
920000	924000	And so our fortune cookie message is always kind of like our sign off message at the end of the night.
924000	928000	And Jamie, for years and years, because we've been doing this for years.
928000	930000	I used to actually make up a fortune cookie message.
930000	934000	That's right. You used to, yeah, I think back in the days of OLR, you used to have like a little saying.
934000	938000	And then it became a little more like, I guess, what you see on the Daily Show and the moment is end and all that.
938000	942000	And when we were on all games and now that we're here on VOG, you just kind of would sign off with that.
942000	946000	So, yeah, I think my first one was love is like wearing your pants on your face.
946000	952000	It can make you a butthead.
952000	954000	Still so relevant to the day.
954000	957000	I know, right? Some things, some advice never changes.
957000	963000	So you know what the best literal fortune I've ever seen was, was when Melody had great things will happen when you.
963000	965000	Oh, yeah, she got that cookie once it was like not finished.
965000	967000	Dan's got the best one, too.
967000	972000	Every man has his enemies.
972000	982000	I got an X rated one once because there used to be this restaurant up in Chico because I went to school for three years up in Chico, California, which was an interesting time in my life to say the place, say the least.
982000	988000	But they have they have the best Mongolian barbecue place up there, the best I've ever had to this day.
988000	996000	And I hope they're still good, but I will I'll give a shout out because at least 10 years ago Hula's was the bomb up in Chico.
996000	1002000	I don't know if we have any listeners up there in Chico, but if you do, if we if we do shout out and that place is the bomb and they used to.
1002000	1008000	They don't anymore. But 10 years ago, you asked for the special fortunes or the pink fortunes and they would bring you the X rated cookies.
1008000	1013000	And they would be things that say like, you know, double your pleasure, double your fun, fuck twins.
1013000	1017000	Or once I got one that says, doesn't this cookie look like a cunt?
1017000	1021000	You know, like, sorry, explicit tag.
1021000	1027000	But this one time we were with a big group of people, like 12 people, we were all eating the fortunes.
1027000	1030000	We had the special ones. Everybody's giggling. And they were like, what'd you get? What'd you get?
1030000	1033000	And then when they came to me, they're like, Rob, what's your fortune say? What's your fortune say?
1033000	1040000	And I'm like, I can't tell you because you know what? You have to eat the cookie or the fortune doesn't come true.
1040000	1046000	So I, you know, taking my sweet ass time eating the cookie, enjoying every bite, really exaggerating it.
1046000	1051000	Finally, I get to opening my fortune and reading it out loud. The fortune said, go fuck yourself.
1051000	1058000	And everybody at the table is like scream laughing because all that effort, I know all that.
1058000	1063000	And of course, if I don't, you know, eat the cookie first, it won't come true.
1063000	1067000	So that was, that was the best fortune I ever got was the one that was a cookie.
1067000	1070000	You told me to go fuck myself. All right. Anyhow.
1070000	1076000	Travis says, Rob, prove you on the right to use the C word.
1076000	1080000	How am I supposed to prove that?
1080000	1082000	You know, you know who, by the way?
1082000	1087000	If you're offended by my use of that, sorry, but a cookie said it first.
1087000	1090000	Oh, I'm not supposed to say cookie. I'm sorry.
1090000	1094000	No one ever, no one has ever said that word as great as Bette Midler.
1094000	1101000	They called me all kinds of horrible things. It started with a C and ended with content.
1101000	1105000	Me no like cookie.
1105000	1108000	So anyway, now that we've earned our explicit tag.
1108000	1109000	Yes.
1109000	1114000	While I'm at it, vagina balls anus.
1114000	1117000	Okay. Wow. All right. It is a show about-
1117000	1118000	Happy holidays.
1118000	1122000	Believe it or not, it's a show about video games. So we are going to talk about video games.
1122000	1126000	I actually don't really have much of a kickoff topic tonight, which is probably for the best.
1126000	1127000	I have one.
1127000	1128000	What?
1128000	1129000	I hate you.
1129000	1130000	Why do you hate me?
1130000	1131000	You're telling me about Frivolo.
1131000	1132000	Oh, the wine?
1132000	1134000	You and you and Victoria.
1134000	1137000	God damn it. I drank a whole bottle of that shit.
1137000	1140000	And then I went and bought two more today.
1140000	1145000	So Victoria's wine addiction, Jamie's wine addiction is the kickoff topic for tonight.
1145000	1147000	There you go. She's got a problem.
1147000	1148000	No, I was-
1148000	1150000	Yes, this is an intervention.
1150000	1151000	No, you can't have my Frivolo.
1151000	1154000	Your Frivolo is affecting your life negatively in the following ways.
1154000	1160000	I was just going to ask kind of just generally, like, what are your guys' plans for the holiday week?
1160000	1165000	And, you know, are you going to be able to get a lot of gaming in or what?
1165000	1171000	I know I'll probably be playing a lot of games throughout this week because I don't do a whole, whole lot for the holidays.
1171000	1173000	And, you know, I have a huge-
1173000	1177000	But would you say you don't have a whole, whole, whole lot?
1177000	1180000	Get the fuck out of my house.
1180000	1184000	Cool. He left his computer.
1184000	1189000	Bye. Yeah. Scram. That's what I thought.
1189000	1191000	All right. Anyway.
1191000	1197000	Jamie, do you have anything going on this week? Games you're going to be catching up on or anything?
1197000	1202000	Well, I've been playing some Skullgirls, so I might play a little bit more of that.
1202000	1209000	But Dan and I both took advantage of Steam Sales and got the Angry Video Game Nerd game.
1209000	1210000	Okay.
1210000	1213000	So that's on probably my list of new stuff to play.
1213000	1215000	I got to vote for the next game so I can get my card.
1215000	1219000	I voted already. I got my snow globe. You can't have it.
1219000	1224000	I definitely have the Stanley parable I need to catch up on. I bought that in the last sale.
1224000	1226000	That game is the fucking shit.
1226000	1227000	Yeah. No, I know. I've heard a lot-
1227000	1229000	I love the Stanley parable.
1229000	1230000	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
1230000	1234000	Jason, anything you're going to plan on catching up on during the week? When do you go back to Colorado?
1234000	1236000	I- February.
1236000	1237000	Oh, shit.
1237000	1238000	We're going to have you-
1238000	1239000	That game's completely serious.
1239000	1241000	We're going to have you well past the holidays, aren't we?
1241000	1242000	Yeah.
1242000	1243000	Alrighty.
1243000	1244000	We'll be here to shoe in the new year.
1244000	1245000	Nice.
1245000	1246000	And then some.
1246000	1247000	Mm-hmm.
1247000	1248000	Any gaming that you plan to catch up on?
1248000	1252000	Oh.
1252000	1253000	Not really.
1253000	1254000	Not really?
1254000	1256000	There's no TV in the apartment.
1256000	1265000	We have a set up at the office and I could do that, but nothing- there will be games, but no specific plans.
1265000	1266000	Okay.
1266000	1269000	Loki, what about you? I know you're waiting for the baby, but-
1269000	1278000	Um. I don't know. Maybe more Grand Theft Auto. I was supposed to play this weekend because they had like some multiplayer event, but didn't do anything there.
1278000	1287000	And I've been playing buy things on Steam sale the game, so yeah, there's that.
1287000	1293000	Alrighty. So it sounds like everybody's just building up their backlog further of games to tackle in the new year.
1293000	1295000	Every sale. Every sale.
1295000	1302000	I came so close to getting a PlayStation 4 this week, you guys. And then finally I was just like, alright, but really, what are you gonna play on it?
1302000	1312000	So I have to wait until there's a couple more games on it and then I'll buy it. But I was thinking I'd have that to play over the holidays, but looks like that didn't end up happening.
1312000	1315000	For the record, the community choice game is The Walking Dead.
1315000	1316000	Yes. Good pick.
1316000	1317000	That's the last one that won.
1317000	1319000	I voted for Duke Nukem for the next sale because I won-
1319000	1320000	Me too. Ditto.
1320000	1321000	I won it when it's too cheap.
1321000	1322000	Got it.
1322000	1324000	I know. I want it to be- Well, vote for it for me.
1324000	1327000	I own it too, but I still voted for it because hell yes.
1327000	1328000	I want that multiplayer.
1328000	1330000	They have a multiplayer beta right now on it.
1330000	1331000	Ooh, the multiplayer's in beta?
1331000	1334000	Yeah, multiplayer's in beta, so you can actually play multiplayer if you want.
1334000	1337000	Nice. Excited about that.
1337000	1340000	SSG100Matt in chat says, I actually bought La Lulana today. I missed that. I didn't see that.
1340000	1341000	Yeah, I bought that today too.
1341000	1342000	That's a buck.
1342000	1343000	Damn it.
1343000	1344000	It was like a buck. Two bucks.
1344000	1345000	I missed it.
1345000	1347000	I think I bought it for a Thanksgiving sale.
1347000	1348000	It'll probably show up on a daily sale.
1348000	1350000	Oh, easily. Of course. Absolutely.
1350000	1352000	Put it in your wish list so you get notified next time.
1352000	1354000	I get a lot of meal about that.
1354000	1358000	Anyway, all right. Let's get into- I mean, we're kind of already talking about it a little bit.
1358000	1362000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and specifically what video games have you been playing this week?
1362000	1365000	What have you been into? What's been going on in your gaming world?
1365000	1367000	Dark Sakura.
1367000	1373000	Well, let's see. I bought La Lulana today. I've been playing- I actually got back into Final Fantasy XIV,
1373000	1375000	but I completely forgot what the fuck I was doing.
1375000	1381000	However, I did find I had another story quest to do, so that means I'll have to do my job quest for another few levels.
1381000	1383000	With that new patch now, it's like everything's changed.
1383000	1388000	Because now you can do a daily dungeon to get XP, you can do guild tests to get XP,
1388000	1394000	you can do the guild levs now give a reasonable amount of XP, but you can do those as regular quests.
1394000	1399000	The patch really changed a lot, and almost all of it's for the better.
1399000	1405000	Well, I've played for a little bit, but for some reason I was getting kind of stupidly motion sick.
1405000	1410000	And I really am trying not to play too much more until my computer upgrade's finished.
1410000	1421000	Because Dan decided to bust out our friend, the credit card, and buy new cases, new CPUs, new processors,
1421000	1429000	new motherboards, USB adapters, and he's buying me a new sound card as well,
1429000	1433000	so that the rest of our computers catch up to our bitchin' graphics cards.
1433000	1441000	Seriously, it's like you have a graphics card that can handle a horde of 20,000, and a processor that can handle 10.
1441000	1447000	So, yeah. Tired of my games choking up, so we've been sort of taking it, uh, you know.
1447000	1454000	I've copied over so many things, and I know Steam Cloud will back up my saves, but I still want to, you know,
1454000	1460000	like I've got all my Mass Effect stuff. I'm going to have to manually re-patch my Mass Effect 3 for the high res stuff,
1460000	1464000	because I don't want to have to go through the, I mean, I've got all the textures and everything saved,
1464000	1469000	and good thing I know how to do that. But, like, if I'm going through all of this effort to upgrade my computer,
1469000	1477000	I want everything that I play to still look awesome. So, um, that's really had me sort of slow down on some of my gaming.
1477000	1480000	I'm really jealous that you got a computer upgrade, though, because that's something I want, too.
1480000	1482000	Yeah, but my computer's like four or five years old.
1482000	1486000	Yeah. Well, mine's getting there, too. I bought mine when I was with my ex, so that was like five years ago.
1486000	1490000	Good fries. Dan founds, just talk to us later.
1490000	1495000	Well, Alan did a really cool thing where online, he used some website, and maybe he can say it in chat,
1495000	1502000	but it's like a build your own PC site where you put in the components you want, and it shows you what stores have it for the cheapest price,
1502000	1506000	like how much your computer would cost overall. I think it's like build a PC or build a PC or something,
1506000	1511000	he'll say it in chat here in a minute, but he has like a computer for me saved on that site.
1511000	1516000	Well, I'll tell you what we often do like at Fry's, and I know Fry's isn't everywhere,
1516000	1521000	but we have a little app called Shop Savvy that is for iPhone, Android, everything,
1521000	1527000	where you scan the barcode on whatever component it is that you want, and since Fry's has to price match,
1527000	1531000	that's their policy, you can use the Shop Savvy app and have them check it,
1531000	1536000	and so they'll still give you whatever the lowest price you find on it is, so you don't have to really go much of anywhere else.
1536000	1537000	Wow, nice.
1537000	1544000	Yeah, it's Shop Savvy, everybody use it. I bought my copy of Battle Royale, instead of paying 20 bucks at Best Buy,
1544000	1553000	I paid 10 bucks. I bought my Mass Effect 3 for 30 bucks when it was still going for 50 something on the PC, so I'm just saying.
1553000	1555000	PCPartPicker.com.
1555000	1560000	That is the website, thank you. Mako said it and then Alan confirmed it there. PCPartPicker, that is the site.
1560000	1564000	But other than that, I've been playing Animal Crossing and playing Zelda.
1564000	1565000	Awesome.
1565000	1571000	I can't get past the stupid fucking worm shit in the second fucking level, god damn it.
1571000	1573000	You'll get there.
1573000	1580000	Well, it's like, and the same thing happened in The Link to the Past to me, when I was 14, 15 something,
1580000	1587000	and so it took me two hours to beat it on that one, and I don't want it to take me that long because,
1587000	1594000	damn it, it's the 2010 era, and I have no patience. I want my gratification, give it to me.
1595000	1597000	So, I turned off the game and drank half a bottle of wine.
1597000	1601000	Works for me. Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1603000	1607000	Did Loki walk away? Loki? Loki, are you on mute?
1608000	1610000	Have that, just a sec.
1610000	1613000	Babies coming, everybody, show's over.
1613000	1618000	The wonders of doing a show on Skype. Alright, Jason, why don't I just go to you while we wait for Loki?
1618000	1621000	I just bought the You Don't Know Jack classic pack for $5.
1621000	1622000	Did you really?
1622000	1624000	Did you act deaf? I seriously did.
1624000	1631000	And I can play none of them until I figure out how to work out a Windows box for my deluge of games that I cannot play natively.
1631000	1639000	Speaking of Windows and not being able to play natively, not exactly gaming, but I got a new-to-me laptop this week that is a Retina MacBook Pro.
1639000	1646000	It's kind of amazing. It's very funny when websites and programs, graphics are,
1646000	1653000	you can really start to tell when they cheaped out on saving the graphics because you look at the text, it's beautiful.
1653000	1659000	You look at everything else, it's terrible and smudgy. It's really hilarious.
1659000	1666000	I am enjoying this laptop so far. And it's so much lighter. Oh my god, I can't even put into words even though I just did.
1666000	1669000	I played a bit more Papers, Please this week.
1669000	1671000	I've heard a lot of great things about that game.
1671000	1673000	It is insanely fun.
1673000	1674000	It's like on my list.
1674000	1686000	For something, it's so frustrating and you definitely get the demerit, the violation kind of being on edge if you got a violation or not.
1686000	1691000	But it's for whatever reason really really fun and I just cleared it for the first time.
1691000	1697000	I have a screenshot up on Steam. I need to go back and start doing it via other methods.
1697000	1703000	I won't say which ending I got or which other ones because they are all incredibly meaningful so I'm just going to skip that outright.
1703000	1706000	If you're my friend on Steam, go look it up. You'll figure it out.
1706000	1715000	I... Code Man sent me Surgeon Simulator as a gift and that game is... I've been wanting to play it since I've seen videos.
1715000	1718000	I am hilariously bad at it and I think everybody is.
1718000	1720000	I think everybody is pretty much.
1720000	1721000	It's so much fun.
1721000	1726000	And I picked up Electronic Super Joy for $1.50. Still need to play it.
1726000	1732000	So anyways, the real meaning for one is this week I bought an Xbox One and PS4 controller.
1733000	1737000	I have not... I have not bought the systems. They are here in my hands right now.
1737000	1740000	They are here in studio. He brought them in here and he said, look what I bought.
1740000	1741000	And he handed me the PlayStation 4 controller.
1741000	1742000	Where's the consoles?
1742000	1743000	And I was like, you bought...
1743000	1744000	I just bought controllers.
1744000	1746000	I'm like, you bought both consoles? He's like, no, just the controllers.
1746000	1748000	I'm like, you're so weird, Jason.
1748000	1753000	I... For some reason I thought that I heard both controllers work natively with computers.
1753000	1755000	That's not the case.
1755000	1762000	As I also recently learned, and I posted this picture to Twitter, the Xbox One controller uses Wi-Fi.
1762000	1769000	And for that reason alone, computers, like game controllers via Wi-Fi on a computer are not a thing by default.
1769000	1773000	That said, the PS4 controller works over USB and Bluetooth.
1774000	1779000	When I first got it, I tried using Steam's big picture and playing games.
1779000	1781000	It was being fussy. It wasn't working.
1781000	1784000	Rogue Legacy control scheme was really, really fucked up.
1784000	1788000	I wanted to have a second swing of it last night when preparing a little bit for the show.
1788000	1793000	And I managed to bind everything in Steam big picture mode, which then affected Rogue Legacy.
1793000	1794000	Nice.
1794000	1799000	And so I was playing Rogue Legacy for like two hours last night with a controller and it worked incredibly well.
1799000	1800000	Big picture mode is good times.
1800000	1803000	I think when I finally do get a new computer, I'll use the old one on the TV.
1803000	1804000	It'll be fun.
1804000	1809000	It works exceedingly well in lieu of the Steam machine controller.
1810000	1816000	Uh, BlackWolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying to you, Jason, they said they would work eventually.
1816000	1819000	Yeah, they'll be, well, on Windows eventually.
1819000	1821000	And then somebody will do a third-party one for the Mac.
1821000	1825000	Yeah, it'll happen next year. A bit disappointing that I can't use it already.
1826000	1830000	It's interesting. The Xbox One controller has the right heft.
1830000	1837000	And the PS4's triggers, L2 and R2, don't feel quite right.
1838000	1841000	But when I actually, and that was my initial reaction.
1841000	1844000	When I actually sat down and played the game, it didn't make a difference.
1844000	1847000	They both worked, tactile, responsive, felt right.
1847000	1851000	The Xbox One's D-pad is so much better.
1851000	1854000	Even better than the Xbox 360 pro controller.
1854000	1856000	Yes, yes, a hundred times yes.
1856000	1862000	The Xbox One controller is so clicky in like the best way though.
1862000	1864000	Maybe I just have fat thumbs.
1864000	1868000	But when I do like, let's say I'm doing a Hoduken move on the little control pad there.
1868000	1871000	My thumb like bumps the other thumb stick.
1871000	1873000	That's the only little problem I have.
1873000	1874000	Interesting.
1874000	1876000	Maybe I just have big thumbs.
1876000	1878000	You know what they say about guys with big thumbs.
1878000	1880000	Yeah, big gloves.
1880000	1882000	Thank you for beating me to it.
1882000	1885000	I saw, so yeah, the PS4 controller is working well.
1885000	1888000	I really do look forward to trying out the Xbox One controller.
1888000	1890000	I'd like to put both of them to use.
1890000	1893000	Funny story, I actually did this exact same thing with the original Xbox.
1893000	1895000	I didn't like the S controllers.
1895000	1900000	And so I went out and bought the original full size fatty Xbox controller for myself.
1900000	1905000	Those wired 360 controllers though made bomb, and still do, like PC controllers.
1905000	1907000	That's exactly why I bought these.
1907000	1908000	That's what I'm using.
1908000	1910000	They are the best game pad you can get.
1910000	1911000	Me too.
1911000	1913000	I'm very happy with this PS4 controller so far.
1913000	1916000	Much more than my Logitech something something something.
1916000	1918000	I'm going to the chat room live.vognetware.com.
1918000	1920000	Tigerclaw with another theory.
1920000	1926000	Jason basically bought those controllers so he can get a handle on how they feel and practice using them when he gets either of the consoles.
1926000	1928000	It's okay, I'm still going to suck at all the games.
1928000	1931000	Especially if I play it against other people that actually own it.
1931000	1936000	But I appreciate console game pads and I'm happy with them.
1936000	1938000	Alright, so.
1938000	1940000	I like that you can push the little touchpad.
1940000	1943000	Yeah, I don't know how many people know this, but the touchpad is actually a button.
1943000	1949000	The touchpad doesn't work on a computer, but the fact that it is a button and can be depressed does actually work.
1949000	1951000	It may work on a computer someday.
1951000	1953000	Yeah, eventually. Out of the box.
1953000	1959000	Saw a new game that will be out next year that is in the show roll so I'll leave it for later.
1959000	1968000	I would have screamed loudly in enthusiasm had there not been another housemate in the apartment that I'm staying in.
1968000	1970000	And also in an apartment.
1970000	1971000	You would have shrieked.
1971000	1977000	I would have. I would have nerd shrieked, nerdgazamed, and nerd other expletives that I will leave for your imagination.
1977000	1981000	Alright. On that note, I think Loki's back. Hi, Loki.
1981000	1984000	Sorry about that. Yeah, my mom called me.
1984000	1987000	That's alright. She never calls you when you're here.
1987000	1991000	No, she doesn't. She can't find my sister, but not my problem right now.
1991000	1995000	Alright. Well, I hope they find her. Did they check behind the couch?
1995000	1997000	Maybe.
1997000	1999000	Alright, how was your gaming week, Loki?
1999000	2003000	I played a little bit of Just Cause multiplayer.
2003000	2008000	Actually, now that it's launched officially, I checked out some of the servers on there.
2008000	2012000	I picked just a random one and playing it a little bit.
2012000	2016000	So it's pretty fun. They had all their weapons and purchasables free.
2016000	2018000	So that was kind of neat.
2018000	2021000	And then I played a little bit of Saints Row IV.
2021000	2028000	I mentioned before that I had bought the season pass for DLC when it was on sale.
2028000	2036000	And so I got a chance to finally play through Enter the Dominatrix, which was, as expected, incredibly short.
2036000	2044000	And unfortunately, the whole joke that they were trying to go with it, the whole mockumentary thing, just wasn't very funny.
2044000	2051000	And thank god they didn't ever release Enter the Dominatrix as a full game because it would have been fucking terrible.
2051000	2061000	And in fact, the whole thing, there was only one time that I laughed in it, which was at the very end of the game where you friend these raptors.
2061000	2070000	And so you're riding the raptors out of the simulation while they're singing this song of their people, which is Walk the Dinosaur.
2070000	2076000	So that was kind of funny, but the rest of it just wasn't funny at all.
2076000	2083000	That's unfortunate to hear it's not that funny, because I associate Saints Row with one of the funniest games I've played.
2083000	2086000	They tried to do some stuff that's supposed to be funny.
2086000	2095000	Some of the cutscenes were animatics and literally some dude holding an action figure and doing something.
2095000	2099000	I don't know, I guess that was supposed to be funny, but it just wasn't funny.
2099000	2101000	It's like they were trying too hard.
2101000	2103000	Fair enough.
2103000	2108000	And then... I bought lots of things.
2108000	2114000	I really wasn't going to spend a ton of money on the seam sale, but...
2114000	2117000	That's what they all say, Loki. That's what they all say.
2117000	2120000	So let's see what I picked up here.
2120000	2123000	The orange box, because surprisingly enough I didn't have that.
2123000	2131000	Noidulove 2 Devolution, which is kind of like a sprite-based shooter.
2131000	2137000	Retrograde, which is kind of a space shooter slash rhythm game.
2137000	2146000	The whole game plays backwards, so you basically have to move where bullets came from, and it goes with the music.
2146000	2153000	Then there's Ballpoint Universe Infinite, which is a hand-drawn game.
2153000	2159000	And Blockland, which is very much like Minecraft, but it actually looks like Legos.
2159000	2165000	So that's kind of neat, and they have a whole deathmatch thing with that as well.
2165000	2172000	Final Fantasy VII, and then of course Cody got me the Stanley Parable, so that was pretty sweet.
2172000	2176000	And then today I had to pick up La Mulana because it's down to like a buck or something.
2176000	2179000	Can't believe I missed it. So upset.
2179000	2183000	You can always catch the Yesterday sales, though. They repost them.
2183000	2185000	Wasn't that a Flash sale?
2185000	2186000	I don't know.
2186000	2187000	It was a Flash sale, yeah.
2187000	2190000	It'll come up again. I'm not worried about it.
2190000	2192000	So yeah, pretty much that.
2192000	2195000	And then I don't think I actually played any Grand Theft Auto Online.
2195000	2199000	They've been doing some mass bandings. Thankfully I didn't get caught up in that.
2201000	2210000	So that's it. Just trying to get through the DLC stuff for Saints Row IV since my save got pretty much eradicated.
2210000	2213000	And so I've been kind of running through that real fast.
2213000	2218000	And I still haven't unlocked the Christmas DLC because that's later on in the game.
2218000	2221000	So once I get to that, I'll talk about that.
2221000	2225000	At least hopefully that has the potential to be a little bit funnier than this last one.
2225000	2226000	Alrighty.
2226000	2228000	Getting into my gaming week.
2228000	2232000	Talking about some games I've played before and I've talked about before.
2232000	2234000	More Final Fantasy XIV.
2234000	2236000	Loving the new patch.
2236000	2241000	Being able to level up an alternate job class much better than just fate partying to death.
2241000	2243000	So that's amazing. I love it.
2243000	2246000	And thank you to Generous Listeners.
2246000	2249000	By the way, I know some folks have mentioned Codeman got them games.
2249000	2251000	Codeman got me a game too.
2251000	2253000	X-Link was kind enough to get me a game too.
2253000	2255000	So I just want to thank the listeners.
2255000	2257000	You guys really don't have to. Thank you so much.
2257000	2260000	Speaking of Generous Listener, did you see in chat what Dark Tetsuya said?
2260000	2263000	Dark Tetsuya says, Rob, if you want it, you can have my Steam key.
2263000	2265000	Oh my god, what a nice... Yes, yes, I want it.
2265000	2268000	Thank you. That's amazing. Thank you so much.
2269000	2272000	I can pay you in doggy coins.
2272000	2275000	Or is it Doge? I don't know. How do you say the D-O-G-E?
2275000	2276000	Dog.
2276000	2277000	Is it just dog coins?
2277000	2278000	Dog.
2278000	2279000	I say doggy.
2279000	2280000	It's dog.
2280000	2283000	Okay, I have not gotten into... Okay, Tangent Train, choo choo choo.
2283000	2286000	I have not really gotten into any of this virtual currency crap.
2286000	2289000	Like I've heard of Bitcoin and I know people are into it.
2289000	2292000	But then like, okay, so you know Matt that was on the show a couple weeks ago?
2292000	2296000	Like we're friends, he's on Facebook and he made all these posts about doggy coin.
2296000	2299000	And you know that meme, it is a really funny meme.
2299000	2304000	You know the, wow, such impress, many excite, wow.
2304000	2305000	You know that whole thing.
2305000	2308000	And so I just started going link, link, link and I read all this stuff on it.
2308000	2312000	And suddenly I'm like mining coins and getting all this stuff.
2312000	2314000	So I have doggy coins.
2314000	2315000	So I can pay you...
2315000	2316000	I call it doge.
2316000	2319000	I can pay you for La Milana and doggy coins if you want Dark Tetsuya.
2319000	2321000	Just get a wallet for it.
2321000	2324000	So anyway, sorry, that was like a totally random tangent.
2324000	2327000	But that was taking up like, that was insomnia night.
2327000	2328000	Much insomnia.
2328000	2329000	Such clicking links.
2329000	2330000	Wow.
2330000	2331000	I call it doge.
2331000	2332000	Doge?
2332000	2333000	Yeah.
2333000	2334000	I think doggy.
2334000	2335000	Is there a correct way to pronounce it?
2335000	2336000	That's what I want to know.
2336000	2339000	My understanding of it is that it's born out of Homestar Runner.
2339000	2346000	And I don't know why letters were, why like the word, the spelling D-O-G-E was introduced.
2346000	2351000	But Homestar Runner was making fun of, was making fun of people calling each other dog.
2351000	2358000	So he kind of drawed out dog and spelled it D-O-G-E, presumably like a animation caption.
2358000	2360000	I need to go see the episode.
2360000	2361000	But...
2361000	2362000	Sorry, I just...
2362000	2365000	Just to read the things going through from several people.
2365000	2366000	Yeah.
2366000	2370000	Doge Lounge Radio, such audio, many commentary, very podcast.
2370000	2374000	You have to, such audio, many commentary, very podcast.
2374000	2377000	There were, Buzzfeed put a bunch of those up, by the way, about different political things.
2377000	2379000	Well, Buzzfeed likes to jack everything.
2379000	2381000	Yeah, but I thought, I left my ass off.
2381000	2383000	Have you seen, there's a great Tumblr.
2383000	2386000	It's Buzzfeed without GIFs.
2386000	2390000	So it's just, it's just the writing.
2390000	2392000	So you can see how fucking awful it is.
2392000	2394000	Anyway, anyway, sorry.
2394000	2395000	Total train to rail met.
2395000	2396000	Let's go back to my games.
2396000	2397000	What?
2397000	2398000	Choo choo.
2398000	2401000	Thank you to the generous listeners that somehow that turned into doggy coin.
2401000	2403000	So thank you to the generous listeners.
2403000	2405000	Stuff I've been playing in the meantime though.
2405000	2406000	Still Zelda.
2406000	2410000	I got into Minecraft again randomly this week on Xbox and it was...
2410000	2411000	Very pixel.
2411000	2412000	It was...
2412000	2413000	Much pic.
2413000	2414000	Creepy crawlers.
2414000	2415000	Wow.
2415000	2422000	So like Black Wolf made a one-off comment on it while we were playing Final Fantasy 14
2422000	2426000	because he won't admit it y'all, but Bobby Black Wolf got addicted to Final Fantasy 14
2426000	2430000	in the past week and has had my help in clearing some of the early game stuff.
2430000	2433000	But he brought up Minecraft randomly and I was like, I'm going to go play Minecraft on
2433000	2436000	360, which had been the first time I touched it in a long time.
2436000	2440000	And then that exact same day they released Minecraft for the PlayStation 3.
2440000	2444000	And so I was like, I kind of want to get it, but like, Rob, you couldn't even finish your
2444000	2446000	house in Minecraft PC.
2446000	2448000	Why would you get Minecraft PlayStation 3?
2448000	2449000	I don't know.
2449000	2451000	I just, I have to have it.
2451000	2455000	Loki, did you see, did you see Minecraft on PS3?
2455000	2460000	I didn't really, because I was going to buy it, but then they basically said it's exactly
2460000	2462000	the same as the Xbox 360 one.
2462000	2464000	So I was like, eh, I don't really need it.
2464000	2465000	Interesting.
2465000	2466000	I don't know.
2466000	2467000	I might.
2467000	2470000	Like if it was, you know, like the maps were bigger or there's more features or something
2470000	2473000	maybe, but I guess that's all for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one.
2473000	2474000	But trophies, Loki trophies.
2474000	2478000	I wonder if it'll have cross-buy or if you buy it on PlayStation 3, you get it on PlayStation
2478000	2479000	4.
2479000	2481000	But the trophies are exactly the same as the last one.
2481000	2482000	I mean, I don't know.
2482000	2485000	Cross-buy would be really interesting because wouldn't that make like the first portable
2485000	2487000	version of Minecraft?
2487000	2489000	Other than Minecraft portable?
2489000	2491000	iPhone, iPhone, iPod.
2491000	2492000	Oh, I forgot that existed.
2492000	2493000	Okay.
2493000	2494000	Nevermind.
2494000	2498000	Well, it would be the first, the first tactile and like for, for as many buttons as that,
2498000	2503000	as that game has the potential of using and whatnot, that would make a Vita would be a
2503000	2504000	good potential.
2504000	2506000	You know, it would be a lot of fun on the Vita.
2506000	2509000	So I'm looking, I mean, I know that's something they're making, not even just real play.
2509000	2511000	Technically it's supposed to have controller support.
2511000	2516000	I mean, the portable version, I mean, they had a version with controller support for
2516000	2520000	the, uh, was it Sony Ericsson Play?
2520000	2524000	Cause, cause everybody's going to be playing it on that.
2524000	2525000	All right.
2525000	2526000	Anyway, let me get to the game.
2526000	2528000	I really wanted to talk about it cause that was all a bunch of old stuff.
2528000	2530000	Let me talk about the new game this week.
2530000	2532000	And a lot of people talking about this game and I've been playing an awful lot of this
2532000	2533000	game as well.
2533000	2537000	Um, so we're going to talk about Nintendo direct in a little bit and some of the stuff
2537000	2538000	that they announced this week.
2538000	2542000	Cause Nintendo kind of was the big newsmaker this week because they actually did a direct
2542000	2543000	with some new news.
2543000	2547000	And one of the games that they, they teased during this Nintendo direct was yes.
2547000	2554000	New news, uh, was this surprise NES remix, a brand new game that they put out on the
2554000	2556000	um, eShop for $15.
2556000	2562000	And of course the minute I saw the trailer, I was like, such retro games, many pixels.
2562000	2563000	Wow.
2563000	2564000	And I bought it.
2564000	2565000	Right.
2565000	2566000	So I had to just go immediately to the store and buy it.
2566000	2571000	Um, because you know, it tickled my retro bond and I love, that sounds kind of dirty
2571000	2574000	actually, but I, you know, I just love those retro games and collections.
2574000	2577000	So I went immediately to the shop and bought it.
2577000	2578000	Did you have a retro boner?
2578000	2580000	I might have a little bit actually.
2580000	2584000	So, you know, and it was, it was, it was a very Beyonce thing cause they get, it said
2584000	2589000	it's on the eShop right now, which was really spectacular when you consider that they went
2589000	2593000	to the VGX thing the week before and decided to talk about it.
2593000	2595000	Said nothing about it.
2595000	2596000	Said nothing about it.
2596000	2599000	It was like, we got cranky Kong and that's all I'm going to tell you, Jeff Keeley.
2600000	2605000	And they do, they do a Nintendo direct days later with like actual news.
2605000	2606000	Fantastic.
2606000	2608000	Didn't we say that was exactly what was going to happen though?
2608000	2612000	That they were going to give, give another outlet nothing and still rely on their own
2612000	2613000	outlets for doing this?
2613000	2619000	Um, I don't know if we really had said that, but I was kind of surprised that like, I mean
2619000	2623000	one week, Jason, it was one week later, they knew all this other stuff and they purposely
2623000	2626000	held onto it for their own direct for whatever reason.
2626000	2630000	They have a captive audience and they're going to keep, they're, they're going to make that
2630000	2631000	their point.
2631000	2632000	Yeah.
2632000	2633000	So, okay.
2633000	2635000	I want to talk about NES remix though, because I bought the game and I'm sure a lot of you
2635000	2636000	guys have seen this.
2636000	2643000	Many people have been comparing it to WarioWare, which it's kind of an iffy comparison to me
2643000	2648000	because WarioWare is very fast paced and the eight bit levels and things in that were very,
2648000	2653000	uh, you know, it was like push button dodge, you know, it was like one quick little thing
2653000	2655000	because that's how WarioWare was.
2655000	2659000	Whereas NES remix is more little bite sized samples.
2659000	2664000	It's like, it's like the Halloween bag full of the mini Snickers bars and full of the mini.
2664000	2665000	It's fun sized.
2665000	2666000	Yes.
2666000	2668000	It's like one of those fun sized Halloween bags.
2668000	2672000	They're not micro games, but they're just enough of a taste of some of the retro games.
2672000	2673000	Right?
2673000	2676000	Although I have never put one of those things in my mouth and said, wow, I'm having fun.
2676000	2681000	But here's the problem with NES remix that I have is that because it's a bag of all the little
2681000	2686000	mini candies, unfortunately some of the games they included are like the Hershey's dark
2686000	2688000	chocolates where it's like, I don't want that shit.
2688000	2690000	Hey, those are the best.
2690000	2692000	Well, they're all yours.
2692000	2700000	If you, if you enjoy golf wrecking crew, urban champion, those little candy bars are all
2700000	2701000	you girl.
2701000	2702000	Enjoy.
2702000	2706000	But I'm going to guess there's probably not a lot of fans out there of some of the games
2706000	2708000	that they included in the collection, which all right.
2708000	2709000	All right.
2709000	2710000	All right.
2710000	2716000	That's the one thing that kind of, you know, cause you start with, I think six games and
2716000	2719000	then you unlock others and some of them you go, Oh yay.
2719000	2720000	I got Legend of Zelda.
2720000	2721000	Yay.
2721000	2722000	Yay.
2722000	2723000	That's a great one.
2723000	2724000	And then it's like, Oh, I got golf.
2724000	2725000	Well, I won't be playing that one.
2725000	2728000	I mean, really who likes NES golf anymore?
2728000	2732000	You know, it's a, there's a million better golf simulations out there now.
2732000	2737000	Maybe at the time it was a fun game for, you know, golf fans, but now it's, it's, it's
2737000	2741000	like a, it's painful to go back and play, I think is, is part of the issue.
2741000	2748000	So, um, and, uh, you're playing little portions of these games.
2748000	2755000	So maybe it's like, get from point A to B and it's like, Loki.
2755000	2756000	All right over there.
2756000	2757000	Easy.
2757000	2758000	All right.
2758000	2759000	I don't know.
2759000	2761000	Maybe, maybe they, I'm hoping they found a sister or whatever that was.
2761000	2762000	All right.
2762000	2764000	Anyway, so that was the GPS bell.
2764000	2766000	Oh, we found her.
2766000	2768000	Many rings, such distracting.
2768000	2772000	Um, so you, you, what was the one I was playing right before the show started?
2772000	2778000	It was three super Mario brothers levels and it was break or break the block that has the vine in it.
2778000	2781000	And it was the levels really quick, but find the hidden vine block.
2781000	2785000	But some of them, you know, some of them are hidden over piranha plants and things where you might die.
2785000	2787000	So I, you know, it has a little bit of challenge.
2787000	2798000	So the little bite-sized games, it actually works because I think the way a lot of us approach retro games is that we don't necessarily want to play these retro games start to finish.
2798000	2803000	Especially, it's the way many people feel about like Ice Climber or Clu Clu Land.
2803000	2805000	They don't really need to play those games start to finish.
2805000	2812000	In the case of Ice Climber, you just need to play like 15 seconds of the game to remember like, oh yeah, I remember Ice Climber.
2812000	2814000	Fuck, I hate the physics in this game.
2814000	2815000	Right?
2815000	2818000	That's kind of enough to remind you of the game and that's good enough.
2818000	2821000	So there's that to get out of it.
2821000	2824000	The remix stages, some of them are actually really cool.
2824000	2832000	Like there's one where you play Super Luigi Brothers or whatever where you run World 1-2 and it's backwards.
2832000	2841000	And some stages where the camera will consistently zoom in on your character or zoom out Mario Brothers, like original Mario Brothers levels that scroll.
2841000	2846000	Even though the original Mario Brothers, not Super Mario Brothers, but the original Mario Brothers was a static screen.
2846000	2848000	So they do some neat things.
2848000	2855000	And in playing those levels, I really realized like, wow, Virtual Console really pisses me off.
2855000	2862000	Because you see them doing all these neat little things with the retro games.
2862000	2869000	Like even in like some of the Mario Brothers stages or Super Mario Brothers stages, they add like little sunset backgrounds and some neat little things.
2869000	2871000	It kind of really makes you go like...
2871000	2872000	Very anger, much rage?
2872000	2876000	Yes! Why won't they take this effort with Virtual Console?
2876000	2882000	It's basically the same kind of changes from Mario 1, 2, and 3 NES to Super Mario All-Stars 1, 2, and 3.
2882000	2883000	I'm going to be honest...
2883000	2885000	More functional maybe, but similar.
2885000	2892000	The more I played NES Remix, the more frustrated I got with just everything.
2892000	2897000	And I know that's going to sound like the weirdest review in the world, but I'm just being honest you guys.
2897000	2904000	As a gamer fan, as a retro game fan, the longer I played NES Remix, the more angry I got at Nintendo.
2907000	2915000	And part of it was that all the games that are included in NES Remix are just games that are available on the eShop.
2915000	2921000	So the whole thing is just, you know, in some ways ads for the games that are on Virtual Console.
2921000	2926000	Yeah! Did you like the part where you can actually link to the part in the eShop where you can purchase all those games?
2926000	2930000	Yes, because it's so adorable, because you hit the button and a little Zelda screen that comes up that says,
2930000	2933000	Buy something, will ya? Oh, that's so cute!
2934000	2939000	But it's not to buy extra levels in NES Remix, it's to take you to the eShop to buy the Virtual Console games.
2939000	2940000	I don't know.
2940000	2944000	NES Remix left me feeling very conflicted.
2944000	2952000	I liked a lot of the things they tried to do with it, but as the game went on, my patience for some of the NES classics,
2952000	2959000	using the term loosely in the Hershey's Dark Chocolate games, if you will, were starting to wear thin on me a little bit.
2959000	2964000	And I don't know, I only am playing it now to see what the different Remix levels are,
2964000	2970000	but when I unlock a Remix level that's like, Play golf and get a hole in two in the rain!
2970000	2974000	I'm like, Go fuck yourself! I don't feel like playing that.
2974000	2977000	Luckily you can skip stages and stuff, but I don't know.
2977000	2981000	I thought when I originally saw the headline for that, I was like,
2981000	2985000	Oh look, they're doing a legitimate version of Super Mario Brothers Crossover.
2985000	2989000	But then it was like WarioWare.
2989000	2993000	But I don't know, it's a little more than WarioWare to me.
2993000	2997000	Because WarioWare again is hitting one button or doing one thing.
2997000	3000000	The NES Remix is more bite-sized chunks.
3000000	3004000	But it kind of serves as a big advertisement for Virtual Console, I don't know.
3004000	3007000	Go look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
3007000	3012000	Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, Does NES Remix do leaderboards or anything?
3012000	3016000	No. But it does have Miiverse integration,
3016000	3019000	and when you see posts from either strangers or your friends,
3019000	3023000	it will show what their time was when they made the post.
3023000	3026000	So I don't know why there's not leaderboards in there,
3026000	3028000	because they obviously are tracking the times.
3028000	3031000	Because it would look really terrible if you bought that game and you're like,
3031000	3033000	Hey, I'm gonna go buy one of these Virtual Console games.
3033000	3037000	What, no, leaderboard for this game? What the hell?
3037000	3043000	BlackWolf says, The main thing you need to know is that Retro Game Challenge for DS is awesome and it's the same people.
3043000	3046000	That's a very good point. It is the same people that made Retro Game Challenge for the DS.
3046000	3048000	I would have rather just had that on the Wii U,
3048000	3053000	or like a new version of that on the Wii U with like new games or Super Nintendo games or something.
3053000	3056000	I would love that. But that's not what it is.
3056000	3060000	So I don't know. My feedback on NES Remix is mixed.
3060000	3062000	It's truly a mixed review.
3062000	3067000	Like if you really like retro NES games and you're willing to stomach some of it,
3067000	3070000	and $15 doesn't seem too high of a price for you,
3070000	3072000	then I say go ahead and go for it.
3072000	3077000	But just realize when you play it, you're gonna get a little disappointed
3077000	3080000	that you've spent money on other Virtual Console titles,
3080000	3087000	and yet NES Remix does more in some of its bite-sized chunks that Virtual Console refuses.
3087000	3091000	I think that's the best word to use. Nintendo refuses to do with Virtual Console.
3091000	3093000	They refuse to innovate it.
3093000	3097000	Because I'm left to believe that it's not that they can't, it's not that they won't.
3097000	3102000	They refuse because NES Remix shows that they can do more with it.
3102000	3108000	Is that any different from any other publishers, consoles, classic game revivals?
3108000	3112000	Well, sure. Like Capcom Arcade Cabinet's pretty cool.
3112000	3117000	You can do multiplayer online, and you can do the replays that save,
3117000	3120000	and the top high scores, you can look at the little playthroughs,
3120000	3124000	and you have the HD graphics filters, and that's all pretty cool.
3124000	3127000	And that's just the first collection that came off the top of my head.
3127000	3132000	Because I haven't played a revival set in a very long time,
3132000	3137000	but I'm thinking back to like PS2, like the Midway arcade classics,
3137000	3141000	and all that kind of stuff, the various Namco collections.
3141000	3146000	But that was on the PlayStation 2, where a lot of this integration isn't exactly possible.
3146000	3150000	Mostly network-based, and friends, and community, and all that kind of stuff.
3150000	3154000	Modern consoles that do have that information? Okay, I agree. That makes sense.
3154000	3157000	Jason, you saw me playing NES Remix for a little bit.
3157000	3160000	I know you didn't get to touch it yourself, but certainly you're familiar with the Nintendo classics.
3160000	3162000	What if you wanted to touch it, Rob?
3162000	3165000	I'll go get the tablet now, and he can play.
3165000	3169000	Which, by the way, also interesting to note, tablet does nothing.
3169000	3174000	It's just a second screen, like many Wii U games of late. Just an interesting observation.
3174000	3178000	But anyway, Jason, you were watching me play. Any thoughts from watching?
3178000	3180000	I know you didn't get to touch, but just...
3180000	3182000	I live for those kind of games.
3182000	3185000	I was backseat gaming the whole time Rob was playing.
3185000	3187000	It's like, you could have just dodged it.
3187000	3192000	He was playing classic Mario Brothers, with the three layers,
3192000	3198000	and you have to hit the block with an enemy on it to flip the turtle upside down,
3198000	3202000	hit the monkey red demon things twice, all that kind of stuff.
3202000	3206000	And I was like, you could have just gone up a level temporarily in order to dodge that fireball.
3206000	3209000	I was backseat gaming the whole freaking time.
3209000	3211000	I live for that kind of game.
3211000	3215000	If I had a Wii U, I would get that in a heartbeat.
3215000	3218000	It was very fun. It was very fun looking.
3218000	3220000	It looked like it controlled well.
3220000	3224000	That is with regard to how the game played originally.
3224000	3228000	It was not improved, which is kind of a good thing,
3228000	3232000	because it was meant to be something specific.
3232000	3238000	It was the most prominent parts of all of the games that you played,
3238000	3241000	which is exactly the same for every single hole in golf,
3241000	3245000	but the bits of Zelda where you pick up the Triforce,
3245000	3249000	dodging enemies to go get the magic sword, the white sword that you picked up,
3250000	3253000	it looked commendable.
3253000	3257000	It looked really fun, and not only the games by themselves,
3257000	3261000	but those remixed levels looked outstandingly fun.
3261000	3266000	I likened it to Dance Master mode in DDR since Extreme US,
3266000	3272000	just subtle little variations on existing content to come up with something brand new.
3272000	3275000	It looked fun. I would not mind playing that.
3275000	3277000	You'd pay $15 for it?
3277000	3281000	That's really hard to say right now.
3281000	3286000	I definitely would to try it out.
3286000	3289000	Would I feel like it was still worth it afterwards? I have no idea.
3289000	3291000	I didn't touch it. I just watched, but it looked fun.
3291000	3293000	Alright, fair enough.
3293000	3296000	Show where every gamer has a voice. What do you guys think about NES Remix?
3296000	3298000	Tell us in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com,
3298000	3301000	or if you've played the game, maybe you disagree with some of the things I've said.
3301000	3304000	Maybe you're overwhelmingly positive or overwhelmingly negative.
3305000	3308000	Some of the websites out there ran very negative reviews of the game this week.
3308000	3309000	I'd like to try it.
3309000	3311000	And I want to say again, I'm leaving it with a mixed review,
3311000	3315000	because there was elements of what Jason's saying that I liked too.
3315000	3319000	Again, I think some of these games are best experienced in bite sizes,
3319000	3325000	but I don't know. There is some inherent frustration that came from this game as well.
3325000	3328000	It is what it is. Take it or leave it.
3328000	3331000	Anyway, we need to move on with the show and get into some of the other news.
3331000	3333000	Let me talk quickly about housekeeping.
3333000	3336000	We will be here next week. We aren't planning on taking time off for the holidays,
3336000	3339000	just because Sunday's fall on pretty good days this year,
3339000	3341000	where we can do shows uninterrupted.
3341000	3343000	So we will be here next week.
3343000	3346000	Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
3346000	3349000	Also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
3349000	3352000	We're on Google Plus as well, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
3352000	3354000	Even if they're being bastards.
3354000	3356000	Yeah, we'll get into that later.
3356000	3358000	I also want to give a plug for this real quick,
3358000	3361000	because I think tomorrow is the last day that you can nominate for...
3361000	3364000	No, I think it's today, actually. It's the last day you can nominate for the Stitcher Awards.
3364000	3367000	So maybe this won't do anything for our podcast listeners,
3367000	3371000	but for our live listeners would love it if you would head on over to the Stitcher website
3371000	3375000	and nominate us for Best Games and Hobbies Podcast.
3375000	3377000	Would really, really appreciate that.
3377000	3380000	And your nominations go a long way in helping us get recognized.
3380000	3382000	And remember, we don't...
3382000	3384000	I mean, it's not that like we're sitting here going,
3384000	3386000	we deserve to get all these awards.
3386000	3389000	No, we just realized that as an independently produced show,
3389000	3393000	the exposure that comes with even getting nominated is invaluable.
3393000	3395000	You know, that's more what we're going for.
3395000	3397000	Help us be exposed.
3397000	3399000	Yeah, help us expose ourselves all over the internet.
3399000	3401000	Would really appreciate that.
3401000	3404000	All right, and then I know some other vlog shows definitely worthy of nominations.
3404000	3407000	Some of you guys have been like nominating Bobby one day and us one day. That's cool.
3407000	3410000	I know Understation Live wants to do Most Original,
3410000	3413000	and I think that's perfect for them. It's great. I hope they get that.
3413000	3417000	And certainly, you know, there's other TV and entertainment categories
3417000	3421000	where, you know, critical myth, pod culture, British invaders will all be great choices and so on.
3421000	3423000	So there you go.
3423000	3428000	And yes, SSG100Matt says nominate and give all the vlog shows a nice review on Stitcher.
3428000	3431000	Yes, and thank you. SSG100Matt, I saw your review on Stitcher this week,
3431000	3433000	and thank you. That was great.
3433000	3436000	So those reviews really, really help.
3436000	3437000	So I really appreciate it.
3437000	3442000	And thanks to everybody at Stitcher and everywhere that's listening to podcasts for supporting the show.
3442000	3443000	Really appreciate it.
3443000	3446000	I hope you're having a good time listening and participating with our show.
3446000	3448000	Let's get into some news.
3448000	3450000	Loki's going to start us off.
3450000	3457000	Okay, so this was kind of unexpected when they were talking about games coming out during the whole Nintendo Direct.
3457000	3459000	It's a new Zelda game.
3459000	3463000	Not exactly the Zelda game you might have been looking forward to, but it's a new one.
3463000	3467000	And it's being dubbed right now Hyrule Warriors.
3467000	3474000	It's basically a spinoff of the Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors series.
3474000	3477000	And it's just like that.
3477000	3485000	But now set in Hyrule, you play Link, and it's got all the different enemies and stuff from the series.
3485000	3489000	And the same kind of gameplay you expect from a Dynasty Warriors game.
3489000	3493000	So it's supposed to come out sometime in 2014 for the Wii U.
3493000	3495000	What do you think about this?
3495000	3497000	I think it looks neat.
3497000	3504000	I think it would be a little bit more successful if it was compared to Monster Hunter.
3504000	3511000	Because some of the screenshots, especially where they were going up against some of the boss monsters and stuff.
3511000	3515000	It reminded me a little bit of Monster Hunter.
3515000	3518000	So I don't know, it looks neat.
3518000	3521000	More than one Zelda game in a year is always good.
3522000	3527000	Yet another thing VGX was snubbed for from Nintendo.
3527000	3529000	We were just talking about it.
3529000	3536000	I think it's interesting that we have another game where Nintendo is allowed a third party one of their big franchises.
3536000	3539000	I mean, granted, it's a spinoff game and not a main game.
3539000	3543000	We know Team Ninja and Metroid, and some people liked it, some people didn't.
3543000	3545000	But it was an interesting experiment.
3545000	3548000	So I think it's very interesting that we have Zelda as a big one.
3548000	3556000	To let Koei Tecmo do a Dynasty Warriors type of game with that is a pretty big deal.
3559000	3564000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com reminding us that Hyrule Warriors is the working title.
3564000	3566000	It could have a different title later.
3566000	3570000	Who knows, maybe they'll give it a Legend of Zelda and a subtitle.
3570000	3575000	Because if you think about it, things like Phantom Hourglass were kind of not really Zelda games.
3575000	3577000	But they were still in that canon.
3577000	3579000	But they played very differently, so we'll see.
3579000	3586000	SSG100Matt says if Nintendo was really smart, they would have other Nintendo characters as unlockables or DLC heroes to play with.
3586000	3589000	Well, I wonder if some of the characters from Dynasty Warriors wouldn't show up.
3589000	3591000	It would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?
3591000	3593000	Dark Soccer, I don't know if you've seen a lot about this game.
3593000	3595000	Dan and I talked about it.
3595000	3596000	Yeah, do you have interest in it?
3596000	3597000	Not really.
3597000	3608000	I mean, but we were talking about Nintendo having this history of doing spin-offs with the Legend of Zelda series and marketing it out.
3608000	3613000	Like how there were the licenses given for the 3DO and all that in the background.
3613000	3617000	And we were talking about Phantom Hourglass and the Lynx crossbow training.
3617000	3622000	It's another cash grab, really.
3622000	3626000	Well, you remember, this isn't the first time they've done a crossover with Tecmo Koei either.
3626000	3630000	I think they had, was it Romance of the Three Kingdoms with Pokemon?
3630000	3632000	Or it was Nebunaga's Ambition, one of those.
3632000	3635000	That's right, I forgot about that. You're right.
3635000	3639000	Tech2030 in our chatroom says Nintendo Warriors would have been a much better game.
3639000	3641000	Maybe something a little more inclusive of other characters.
3641000	3646000	I don't know, I think there's a lot of people that are going to buy it on Zelda alone.
3646000	3649000	If I was going to do one, I would pick one of the Fire Emblem franchises.
3650000	3654000	Since you've got more characters to choose from, and I believe that the play style is similar.
3654000	3658000	But then again, they just say, oh, it's another Fire Emblem game.
3658000	3662000	Right. I'd be curious to see what happens with that game.
3662000	3665000	Tech2030 actually mentioned Marth.
3667000	3670000	Alright, well something else that came out of Nintendo Direct, another game announcement.
3670000	3675000	It is Dr. Luigi! Because of course it is the year Luigi, is it not?
3675000	3680000	So Dr. Luigi will be kind of the last big hurrah for Luigi in the year of Luigi.
3680000	3684000	It will be hitting the Wii U eShop on December 31st.
3684000	3689000	And as you can probably guess, Dr. Luigi, it's Dr. Mario, but starring Luigi.
3689000	3691000	Now it is being done for the Wii U.
3691000	3695000	It will have an online mode, which means you can go head to head with two player.
3695000	3698000	Which you don't hear very often when Nintendo games, that's pretty exciting.
3698000	3702000	Dr. Luigi will play very similar to the classic NES game.
3702000	3705000	However, there will be a new twist.
3705000	3708000	Operation L is a new mode in the game.
3708000	3715000	And it will feature L-shaped blocks of the two capsules fused together with three matching color blocks within the block.
3715000	3721000	So you have to match four colors together, but it's still a little easier than the original Dr. Mario.
3721000	3724000	So it will be very interesting to see how that all plays out.
3724000	3729000	You know, I have to admit, when I first heard about this, I was like, oh cool, that will be a lot of fun to play.
3729000	3733000	And then I thought, didn't they do this on the Wii? And they did.
3733000	3740000	I don't know if you guys remember, but they actually released Dr. Mario on the Wii, and it was almost like the same thing.
3740000	3742000	I mean, it didn't have the Operation L, that's a new thing.
3742000	3747000	But it had the two player online mode, and I think I remember back then talking about it going,
3747000	3752000	oh yay, finally a Wii game by Nintendo that's like head to head online, that's really exciting.
3752000	3758000	And I think most people bought Dr. Mario, played it for a day, online against like one friend, and then probably never touched it again.
3758000	3763000	So I can't help but wonder if Dr. Luigi is going to meet a similar fate.
3763000	3767000	Granted, if they get their money, they don't care if you play it for one day or a hundred days.
3767000	3770000	But, what do you guys think about Dr. Luigi?
3770000	3773000	I don't have a Wii U.
3773000	3774000	Yeah.
3774000	3776000	So, just come over here and play it.
3776000	3781000	Is that a system seller for you, Dr. Luigi?
3781000	3786000	No. If Dan and I were going to have bought a system, it would be for WinWicker HD.
3786000	3791000	And we clearly haven't bought one yet, so it's not a seller, honestly.
3791000	3797000	If I really, really wanted to play Dr. Mario, I'd hook up my NES. That's it.
3797000	3799000	Fair enough. Jason, any interest in this?
3799000	3801000	I was pretty terrible at Dr. Mario.
3801000	3807000	It's a game and it's continuing a trend of something that Nintendo's been wanting to do topically.
3807000	3810000	It's cute, cool, probably wouldn't buy it.
3810000	3813000	No, I have to say I was really good at Dr. Mario.
3813000	3815000	I'd get up to like level 30 something.
3815000	3821000	I seem to remember always fast forwarding myself to like level 15 or level 20 or something like that.
3821000	3825000	And always dying incredibly quickly and being very frustrated and not playing the game again.
3825000	3833000	That's why you have to start at the beginning. If you start from the beginning and build up, you acclimatize to the speed.
3833000	3840000	It was one of those things where I didn't want to start from scratch and I wanted to make it actually difficult, but I would always make it too difficult.
3840000	3842000	And I never found that a happy medium.
3842000	3846000	I'm also talking like years and years and years ago, so I really don't remember how it all wound up playing out.
3846000	3856000	But maybe if I'm looking for something to pad up a library with, but yeah, no particular interest in jumping on this real quick.
3856000	3858000	Loki, is this a system seller for you?
3858000	3864000	Oh, totally. No, I mean, seriously, Luigi's a terrible doctor, right?
3864000	3869000	Shoving L-shaped pills down someone's throat, it's just a choking hazard.
3872000	3885000	I can't help but feel like games like this and NES Remix were really rushed just to try and beef up Nintendo's offerings on the eShop for better or for worse.
3885000	3892000	I mean, I guess I really can't complain. As much as I might have been a little bit critical of NES Remix earlier, there were good things about it too.
3892000	3898000	And even this, I might see some negative, but I think it's very exciting that we have an online classic game.
3898000	3904000	I mean, everything I've bitched about wanting on Virtual Console, Dr. Luigi does kind of deliver, so I'm excited to see that.
3904000	3910000	So, I mean, if Nintendo were to rush games like this every couple months or whatever, I wouldn't be mad.
3910000	3916000	I'd like to see more of this type of stuff, especially with some of the classics. I think it would be pretty cool.
3916000	3922000	I agree with Fifth Dream, by the way. I can't play Dr. Mario. I'm too good at it and games go on for hours.
3922000	3923000	This is true.
3923000	3924000	Jeez.
3924000	3935000	No, no, no. This is true. If you're good at Dr. Mario, you have to jinx yourself. You cannot start the game and just play through it and be done. It doesn't happen.
3935000	3940000	That's my problem with Civilization V. I'm just too good at it and suddenly it's 4 AM in the morning.
3940000	3944000	Rob, I've had 3 hour game session of Dr. Mario.
3944000	3951000	Alright, alright. I'm trying to think of a game recently that I've done something like that with.
3951000	3953000	Do you remember Every Extend Extra Extreme?
3953000	3954000	Yes.
3954000	3955000	But I'm such a horror.
3955000	3956000	I've had your copy forever.
3956000	3962000	I'm such a horror for Q Entertainment. Well, they had it on an Xbox 360 and I remember I could play that game.
3962000	3968000	I mean, you just keep creating the explosions and do it on the beach. You can keep that game going for hours as well.
3968000	3974000	Now, remember when I was super drunk at my birthday and I played Lumines and got to level 25 while I was super, super drunk?
3974000	3977000	And I had to actually kill myself so that I could drink my beer?
3977000	3979000	That was fun.
3980000	3983000	BlackWolf in our chat room says, humble brag.
3985000	3988000	I apparently am better at puzzle games when I'm really drunk, by the way.
3988000	3991000	It gets you in a state of zen. Alright.
3991000	3993000	I was in a state of I'm on my 8th beverage.
3993000	3996000	Well, Dark Soccer, I know you're sober, but maybe you can read the next story for us anyway.
3996000	3998000	Yeah, maybe I could do that.
3998000	4009000	So, there is, for all the people who are super hyper pissed off at YouTube, like just about everybody,
4009000	4020000	there is a wiki set up so that you can find basically what's going to let you do a Let's Play and monetize it.
4020000	4023000	Maybe, and it does not allow.
4023000	4030000	So, it's a wiki page called Who Let's Play and you can go check out the information there.
4030000	4040000	There is a quote saying that right now the issue is with music and developers are, you know, basically have licensed music non-exclusively.
4040000	4047000	So, that means you might be able to, you know, show a game and the game developer will be fine with it,
4047000	4052000	but the person who created the music has licensed it out to multiple people and not be so cool with it.
4052000	4062000	But the wiki page is useful out there for, you know, knowing what you can and can't do, if in doubt you can check.
4062000	4076000	And there's a second wiki that's for, and it says in quotes, known bad actors who are basically, I guess,
4076000	4079000	it says something about music resellers, so I'm not really sure about that.
4079000	4087000	But there, you know, it's basically labeling out who you can trust, who you can't trust, and what you're going to be able to do as far as that content.
4087000	4092000	Just to clarify though, it will not stop YouTube necessarily from holding up your videos.
4092000	4094000	And the reason why I point that out.
4094000	4095000	They're dicks.
4095000	4099000	Well, yes, and I know Loki's going to explain a little more what's going on in a minute here,
4099000	4104000	but just what's going on with me personally right now on my own channel, my video, my struggle,
4104000	4109000	is that the other day I posted a video playing Final Fantasy XIV.
4109000	4110000	I don't even remember what we were doing in it.
4110000	4113000	Oh, yeah, it was the last night of the 2.0 patch.
4113000	4114000	So we were just running around talking.
4114000	4116000	It was almost like a little mini podcast.
4116000	4117000	It was a lot of fun.
4117000	4119000	And you can check that out on my channel at Rob Roberts Plays.
4119000	4122000	If you're a Final Fantasy XIV fan, we had a lot of fun with that.
4122000	4129000	And YouTube flagged it saying, and it wasn't, it was one of those weird things where it wasn't a copyright claim.
4129000	4131000	It didn't say that somebody had claimed the copyright.
4131000	4134000	It just said, we don't believe that this is your content.
4134000	4137000	You need to prove to us that it's your content if you want to monetize it.
4137000	4141000	Now, I don't have dreams of making thousands of dollars off YouTube videos,
4141000	4147000	but if I could get one of my videos to go viral and maybe pay for some new microphones for OLR, that would be awesome.
4147000	4150000	You know, that's my deal with it.
4150000	4159000	So I was a little pissed off to see that YouTube flagged the video for literally no reason than they just, they want me to prove I own it.
4159000	4162000	Well, the game was Final Fantasy XIV.
4162000	4168000	I believe that's listed on this wiki, or if it's not, it should be, because on Square's website, it says,
4168000	4173000	you can post this on our partner's site, which includes YouTube, and you can make the monetization.
4173000	4174000	Because it was a huge deal.
4174000	4178000	At first, they said no monetization, and they reversed their policy.
4178000	4182000	That was a big deal a few months ago when the game first came out.
4182000	4186000	So it kind of pissed me off that YouTube flagged it for literally no reason.
4186000	4193000	And now the views that I am getting, which of course I'm going to get the most views before the patch is out, I didn't get monetization on.
4193000	4197000	Now, alright, so maybe I lost a quarter, but it's the principle of the thing.
4197000	4201000	And I'm a small time channel, but what about the big time channels that this happened with?
4201000	4207000	So that just, I'm just saying, even though this wiki is out there, it's not going to stop this crap from happening.
4207000	4211000	Anyway, let me let Loki, because I know Loki has some more things to elaborate on this with.
4211000	4216000	I was just going to say though, it's good that someone's taking the time to at least put the information out there.
4216000	4226000	Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's good to know where people stand and to be able to easily educate yourself before you get into the Let's Play business.
4226000	4230000	And that it's a wiki, people can update it too. So it is the community.
4230000	4232000	Yes. Loki.
4232000	4244000	Alright, so YouTube, of course, making a comment regarding this whole fiasco, I guess, and pretty much just sticking by their content ID system.
4244000	4247000	And they had helpful tips, of course, that's great.
4247000	4255000	So they basically said, last week we expanded the system to scan more channels, including those affiliated with multi-channel networks.
4255000	4262000	As a result, some channels, including many gaming channels, saw claims appear against their videos from audio or video copyright holders.
4262000	4270000	Keep in mind, one video may contain multiple copyrighted works, and any of which can potentially result in a claim.
4270000	4275000	Online rights are often resold to companies like music labels and aggregators.
4275000	4280000	While you might not recognize the owner, this doesn't necessarily mean their claim is invalid.
4280000	4293000	And know that we love what you do. We've worked hard to design the content ID and other tools to give everyone from individual creators to media companies the opportunity to make great videos and money.
4293000	4308000	Yeah, that didn't really help, except for the fact that it's monetizing people's videos that really fall under fair use, and the whole thing where you're having a robot do a human's job.
4308000	4311000	Yeah, it's a big ol' mess.
4311000	4322000	But to kind of help a little with that, there is a brand new non-profit resource that's kind of based off that whole who lets play.
4322000	4333000	And what they're doing is allowing, I guess, some support for people that may have been flagged by the content ID system.
4333000	4346000	And their brand new website knows the website will have some standard legal language that will be available to everyone to use and educate them on these legal minefields in a simple and clear way.
4346000	4359000	We also like to create some badges, much like Creative Commons does, that go along with licensed materials which developers can use to advertise on what legal grounds they stand on advertising that their music is safe to use.
4359000	4373000	So basically just kind of going along the lines of that who lets play wiki resource, but expanding it from not just game content, but to music resources and stuff like that.
4373000	4388000	Because there were some people that were actually getting their videos flagged because they had purchased music libraries, and they were using some of this music that they licensed in their videos, and now those are being flagged by the original music owner and stuff like that.
4388000	4397000	Now am I correct in thinking that because it says it has online legal resources and language, they'll have templates that I can actually use in contesting my videos?
4397000	4398000	Yeah, I think so.
4398000	4399000	Nice.
4399000	4412000	So next time we get an episode of Orange Lounge Radio flagged as, we don't believe you own this content, I can paste language in there that will get that turned over as opposed to denied, which happened this past week.
4412000	4415000	Told by YouTube, we do not own the show.
4415000	4417000	Yeah, pretty much.
4417000	4419000	Anyway.
4420000	4431000	Alright, and then last but not least, there was also this issue with some of the music from Terry Cavanagh's VVV.
4431000	4445000	It was being claimed by some company called TuneCore, and the whole situation with that I guess is that TuneCore as well as InMusic, they are partnered I guess.
4445000	4469000	He maybe had his music going through InMusic, and what TuneCore has done is actually helped with the monetization and getting these videos that have their music monetized if it's not the original artist and stuff, and also getting them onto different platforms including iTunes and stuff like that.
4469000	4496000	The problem is though, they're I guess going to only whitelist, I guess now they're going to only whitelist those tracks for the original author, but for example if the creator of VVV wants to allow other people to use their gameplay footage in Let's Play videos and stuff, they're not going to authorize, or TuneCore's not going to authorize them to make money off those videos.
4496000	4505000	They're basically going to collect all the money from it and give only a portion of it to the original copyright owner. So it's kind of a mess there as well.
4505000	4509000	So why on earth would I want to sign up for this TuneCore thing in the first place?
4509000	4511000	I don't know.
4511000	4518000	What's the benefit? Why did the VVV guys sign up for this in the first place? Maybe he thought he was going to get protected and instead...
4519000	4540000	I think it was more of like just maybe to get the soundtracks up on different music networks out there, iTunes, and wherever else that's being played through and maybe get monetization from that, but he probably never thought that it would come back to bite him on YouTube.
4540000	4554000	The role of a publisher in this scenario, exactly like Loki just said, is that you turn your materials into one source and they go quite literally everywhere, still offering you the control of where you actually want them to be.
4554000	4559000	Amazon MP3, iTunes, Spotify, RDO, Pandora, CD Baby, etc.
4559000	4569000	Thank you, I get it now. Bobby's clarifying in chat as well. TuneCore gets you on Spotify, iTunes, etc. They're one of the easier music distribution companies. I see, I get it.
4569000	4583000	An artist friend of mine that lives near back home showed me some of the analytics that they get and it's really impressive. They have a per network breakdown of where they've been making money.
4583000	4592000	So much so that not only is there iTunes revenue, but there's iTunes match revenue, which is its own independent source of where you can actually make money.
4593000	4606000	The problem is that these companies have a stranglehold of sales and reproduction and performance practically everywhere on the internet because they are a digital distribution source.
4609000	4621000	I understand the benefit and until, it's so hard as an individual to work with every single one of those outlets, so I understand the middleman in this particular scenario for now.
4621000	4639000	Things might change as if services actually get to a point where they give the individual artist or group what have you like more thorough control easier or people just want to make like do it all individually so they own all the terms and do not have these conflicts.
4639000	4647000	People are going to start learning and that might be something that has to happen now and it's only, you know, it's only easier every single day to put your music somewhere on your own.
4647000	4658000	To put your music on a network somewhere on your own. That said, these services exist for a reason. They solve a lot of problems for people that are out there to get their name out there and reap the benefit of it.
4659000	4665000	Well, all I know is that this YouTube stuff is growing thin on the community as a whole real quick.
4665000	4671000	And I know there's some people out there that are like, well, people are going to just keep going to YouTube because it's, you know, the only place for it.
4671000	4682000	But when some competitors start coming out and start doing it better, I'm sure, I'm sure somebody at Twitch TV is thinking right now, how can we turn this into a situation that's better for ourselves and our market share?
4682000	4695000	If you don't think people will abandon ship in mass when something better comes along, MySpace would like to welcome you back. Please, Justin Timberlake owns us now. Please, come on back. MySpace, we're cool.
4695000	4705000	I do very easily think that people will go somewhere better, but as far as you, but as far as like YouTube going away is not going to happen.
4705000	4707000	Well, MySpace didn't go away.
4707000	4709000	That's up for debate.
4709000	4711000	Friendster's still around.
4711000	4712000	Is that actually the case?
4712000	4715000	Yes, I think. I think it's like, it's big in Asia, I think.
4715000	4717000	And then Orkut's big in Brazil.
4719000	4721000	Will a better network exist?
4721000	4727000	Yes, absolutely. But the benefit of YouTube is that millions of eyeballs are there.
4727000	4734000	Well, and plus, you know, for better or worse, YouTube has at least if nothing else, all the archive stuff. They've got so much stuff on there.
4734000	4742000	But I think as far as like gamers moving, I think the gaming community may absolutely move somewhere else, especially if a targeted gaming YouTube comes out.
4742000	4748000	But then the question is who would advertise on it? Because keep in mind, that's what this is all about is advertiser and who you see advertiser dollars.
4748000	4750000	Every single one of the publishers.
4750000	4754000	If Twitch TV can exist, a gaming YouTube can exist as well.
4754000	4759000	I absolutely agree with that aspect. Things somebody can make can build a better service and they will.
4759000	4761000	If PornTube exists.
4763000	4774000	Well, the other thing too is, you know, I'm surprised that like, you know, a company like TuneCore in music or whatever doesn't have a way, I'm sure they did on purpose, but doesn't have a way to like say,
4774000	4784000	okay, I don't want you to worry about monetizing music on YouTube. You know, I only want it on iTunes and, you know, wherever Stitcher or wherever it's going.
4784000	4793000	You know, so if, you know, they could somehow get around it that way. But of course, now that they know that they can make money off of, you know, flagging these things.
4793000	4796000	Of course, now they're not going to have that loophole in there.
4796000	4799000	And TuneCore wants to make their money too, right?
4799000	4800000	Oh, yeah.
4800000	4801000	This is how they do it.
4801000	4809000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase shadow.
4809000	4816000	All right, let's move on. I'm sure lots of lots of other thoughts on this. We might get some emails on it the next week, but for now, let's move on with the show.
4816000	4824000	Jason, this is not the classic game of the week, but think back to 1993 with me.
4824000	4834000	DOS was the preeminent IBM operating system. Windows 95 was still being built, I guess, early days of AOL.
4834000	4839000	My 386, my 386 SX16 was the bomb.
4839000	4840000	Playing Doom.
4840000	4844000	We still had these things called floppy disks, because nuts to optical media.
4844000	4846000	Calling into BBSs to play The Pit.
4846000	4847000	So was I.
4847000	4849000	And don't copy that floppy.
4850000	4856000	And a wonderful little game from LucasArts called X-Wing was released.
4856000	4865000	The first in a series of three games that pretty much set the standard for space dogfights.
4865000	4871000	And bolstered by Wing Commander and plenty of other games at the time.
4871000	4881000	If you miss those days, like I do, 2014 is going to be an amazing year because of the announcement of Star Wars Attack Squadrons.
4881000	4893000	Area 52, in conjunction with Disney and LucasArts, are going to publish a up to 16 person multiplayer space battles game under the name Star Wars Attack Squadrons.
4894000	4900000	Please, please, please go to starwars.com slash attack squadrons and sign up for the beta now.
4900000	4904000	Because this game is going to be out in, they're saying currently, the first half of next year.
4904000	4906000	It is going to be amazing.
4906000	4919000	Even though Star Wars Old Republic got its space flight off rails and actually starting battles, there is room for a dedicated game of this caliber.
4920000	4925000	I can't wait. I have nothing else, I have plenty of other things to say.
4925000	4929000	Oculus Rift would make this amazing. I need to go get a flight stick joystick.
4929000	4932000	This game is going to be outstanding.
4932000	4940000	Considering that it is actually going to have, the only games confirmed, sorry, the only ships confirmed right now are the X-Wing and the TIE Fighter.
4940000	4952000	But invariably they are going to build that out so that the rebels have X, A, Y, and B-Wings, possibly also the Z-95 Headhunter from X-Wing and TIE Fighter, X-Wing versus TIE Fighter and all that.
4952000	4961000	And then invariably the Imperial side will have at least the TIE Fighter, TIE Interceptor, TIE Bomber, and we'll see what else they come up with.
4961000	4964000	I can't wait. Period.
4964000	4966000	You're very excited, I can't wait.
4966000	4979000	TIE Fighter, X-Wing versus TIE Fighter is like, you know, I played so many games as a kid, mostly demos, but TIE Fighter was that game that I got through on my own.
4979000	4986000	And maybe cheated a little bit because the cheat codes were right in the menu and that game was fucking impossible if you didn't have invulnerability and infinite missiles.
4987000	4996000	But anyways, I had so much fun with that game, and then they released the CD-ROM version and they had the four bonus campaign missions.
4996000	5003000	I just, everything that was built about that game had the right look, I am so happy to see this news again.
5003000	5009000	Everybody, you know, people have wanted a game like this for a while, LucasArts closing down didn't do any favors,
5009000	5015000	Old Republic, I don't want to be attached to an MMO just to, you know, dogfight in space.
5015000	5018000	This is good news, I cannot wait to see what happens with it.
5018000	5024000	Bochikawa on chat at live.vognetwork.com says, wow fun stuff, so glad they're revisiting this.
5024000	5029000	Dungeonbuster says, I didn't care much for X-Wing versus TIE Fighter though because it didn't have a single player campaign.
5029000	5030000	What?
5030000	5042000	It did, it had a single player campaign, it had a story, you had to examine ships and take out defense platforms and escort the emperor.
5042000	5044000	There was very much a campaign.
5045000	5052000	Alright, well I hope these renaissance type games do well and lead way to other things.
5052000	5055000	I wasn't super into the Star Wars games, I know some people were.
5055000	5056000	Shame on you.
5056000	5060000	Well I like Super Star Wars on Super Nintendo, that was the Star Wars game I enjoyed.
5060000	5065000	But I did love the old Wing Commander games, like Wing Commander 1 and 2, good stuff.
5065000	5072000	I don't think I ever actually owned Wing Commander, which is why it's not as prominent in my brain.
5072000	5080000	I played at least 3 and 4, possibly 1 or 2, I don't remember, but there has been nothing like those games in over a decade now.
5080000	5083000	So this is just straight up good news.
5084000	5086000	Alright, Dark Saga, what do you have for us?
5086000	5089000	I've got some stuff. How about Hearthstone?
5089000	5097000	People have been looking forward to it and Blizzard has been kind of pimping it, however the open beta has been delayed.
5097000	5104000	And it looks like it's going to be done next month, so they're holding it off.
5104000	5110000	It sounds like they're doing some more testing before they do it and they said they don't want to rush it.
5110000	5113000	Don't want to rush it. Make it slower.
5113000	5125000	But they did say that the invites for the closed beta have already gone out and if you don't have it, check your spam folder.
5125000	5128000	For those who signed up for it.
5128000	5132000	Which, by the way, it's about freaking time this open beta gets here.
5132000	5141000	I realize it's been delayed again, but Hearthstone is a beta. I don't know why it's still in beta.
5141000	5150000	The game is fully functional. Yes, there's still some balance issues to be worked out, but the longer it goes on, the more I stop caring about this game.
5150000	5154000	Because it's like, I don't need to see another freaking beta key giveaway.
5154000	5157000	Who is not in this game now that doesn't want to be in it?
5157000	5161000	It's like a Google product. You're really still not in the beta and you want it?
5161000	5167000	I don't know. I've never quite liked card games, but it looks fun and I would not mind.
5167000	5173000	I'm sure somebody in chat has an extra key here. I think Grandpa from Horde House has one. We can get you.
5173000	5179000	Also, they're saying opt-ins for the closed beta end on January 7th. You can opt in on battle.net.
5179000	5184000	Because they need to just take the freaking game live already. It's a little ridiculous.
5185000	5191000	I don't know. Again, it's like a Google product that stays in beta forever and it's past the joke.
5191000	5197000	Tech2030 in chat asking, Hearthstone is going to be free to play, right? Yes.
5197000	5204000	If you want to buy new decks though, that's where the money is from the decks and so forth.
5204000	5209000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5209000	5213000	Although, I think this will probably be a pretty quick segment, being what week it is.
5213000	5215000	But let's check in anyway. Loki?
5215000	5220000	You get a whole bunch of coal. There's nothing.
5220000	5223000	Nothing. Is there anything coming out right after the holidays?
5223000	5228000	Do we have any? Because I remember last year, we got some pretty big stuff right after the holidays.
5228000	5233000	Ni No Kuni was just two weeks after the holidays. Is there anything in 2014 looking like that?
5233000	5242000	Honestly, the next thing in 2014 is going to be January 10th and that's just a disc release of We Fit You.
5242000	5248000	And that's it. The new stuff doesn't come until literally the last week of January.
5248000	5251000	So it's going to be a whole lot of nothing for a few weeks now.
5251000	5254000	If they added a G and an H, that would be We Fight You.
5254000	5261000	Alright, let's travel to Japan. There is some news this week because Christmas is very different in Japan.
5261000	5268000	So right after you chat down on some Christmas cake, you can go out on December 26th and check out Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters.
5268000	5270000	They are coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.
5270000	5272000	What can I do for you?
5272000	5276000	They are getting it in Japan a little bit before We Are.
5276000	5282000	But PlayStation 3 is region-free, so some of you guys might be importing that.
5282000	5286000	You can also check out Ampersand or And.
5287000	5289000	The title is like an ampersand.
5289000	5296000	And then Sora no Muko de Sakimasu yoni in regular and limited edition.
5296000	5298000	Oh, a cutesy game.
5298000	5302000	Yeah, it looks like, you know, Happy Let's See, but that is the title of the game.
5302000	5303000	It's like an ampersand.
5303000	5305000	So I don't know if that's like a, is that an anime that I don't know of?
5305000	5306000	I don't think so.
5306000	5312000	I don't know, but it's cute girls fighting and that whole thing, you know.
5312000	5316000	Looks like she's like walking around with a surrender flag or something.
5316000	5317000	It's kind of weird.
5317000	5318000	I don't know.
5318000	5320000	It's an adventure game.
5320000	5324000	It's from Five PB is putting that out in Japan.
5324000	5328000	Checking out some of the other consoles on the Xbox 360.
5328000	5331000	Nada, nothing this week.
5331000	5334000	On the PlayStation Vita, the Ampersand game is there too,
5334000	5338000	as well as the X and X-2 HD remasters are there as well.
5338000	5342000	And there's also, I believe, a special box set with the PlayStation Vita
5342000	5345000	and the X and X-2 all coming together.
5345000	5347000	So that is on the PlayStation Vita.
5347000	5349000	On the Wii U this week, nothing.
5349000	5353000	But there is an accessory for Wii Karaoke U coming out on December 31st,
5353000	5356000	a little mini speaker system.
5356000	5361000	On the 3DS, A Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Worlds makes its way to Japan this week.
5361000	5363000	That was one that we got first.
5363000	5367000	And they are getting that extra little console bundle that we got here as well.
5367000	5369000	In fact, I want to see, does it look the exact same?
5369000	5372000	I'm kind of curious, because I actually haven't seen what the Japanese one looks like.
5372000	5376000	Yes, it is the exact same bundle we got here, except the box art is way better.
5376000	5378000	I like that box art way better.
5378000	5382000	But it's that same 3DS, except of course it is a Japanese 3DS,
5382000	5384000	because, you know, they're region locked and stuff.
5384000	5387000	And lastly on the PSP this week,
5387000	5390000	Julik Nightmare in regular and limited edition,
5390000	5396000	as well as Sengoku Hime 4 comes out this week on the PSP.
5396000	5399000	There you go. How about the UK Dark Soccer?
5399000	5401000	There's one thing on the list.
5401000	5403000	And it actually says December 25th.
5403000	5406000	Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 on everything.
5406000	5409000	And yeah, it's listing everything practically.
5409000	5412000	Even the Spectrum. No, I'm kidding.
5412000	5414000	No, it's not the Spectrum.
5414000	5416000	It's coming out to finally dust off my 2600.
5416000	5418000	It's on the MSX.
5418000	5421000	You know, I've actually been chatting off and on with Catastrophic Moggy.
5422000	5426000	And he was telling me not too long ago about playing Strider on the Spectrum.
5426000	5427000	Nice.
5427000	5429000	And I was like,
5429000	5431000	Hey Dan, you wanna play Strider on the Spectrum?
5431000	5433000	And Dan's like,
5433000	5435000	No.
5435000	5438000	It's one of those things that probably sounds more fun than it really is.
5438000	5439000	You know what I want?
5439000	5440000	Rose colored retro glasses.
5440000	5442000	What I would love to get for my house.
5442000	5443000	What?
5443000	5444000	Is a Duo RX.
5444000	5446000	So that we can use an arcade card.
5446000	5450000	Or have a converter that we can use an arcade card with on our Duo.
5450000	5454000	Because we can't play his version of Strider for the PC Engine.
5454000	5457000	Without using an arcade card.
5457000	5459000	And of course the pen sets are different.
5459000	5460000	So.
5460000	5461000	Anyway.
5463000	5464000	Alright.
5464000	5466000	Just a couple more news stories for you guys.
5466000	5468000	And the classic game of the week.
5468000	5469000	Loki.
5469000	5470000	Alright.
5470000	5473000	So, you know, of course everyone wants to know
5473000	5476000	What was the most played game in 2013?
5476000	5479000	And Raptor has the answer for that.
5479000	5481000	They broke down the top five games.
5481000	5483000	Of course number one being my personal favorite.
5483000	5484000	Grand Theft Auto 5.
5484000	5485000	Surprise.
5486000	5489000	Followed by Call of Duty Ghosts.
5489000	5491000	On Xbox 360.
5491000	5494000	And actually Grand Theft Auto 5 on 360 was number one.
5494000	5496000	Battlefield 4 on PC.
5496000	5499000	Dota 2 on PC.
5499000	5501000	And last but not least.
5501000	5505000	Final Fantasy XIV Online and Realm Reborn on PC.
5506000	5507000	Wow.
5507000	5509000	I didn't realize Realm Reborn was that high.
5509000	5514000	But I'm also surprised that World of Warcraft, League of Legends.
5514000	5516000	Where are those games?
5516000	5517000	Well, they're all older.
5517000	5521000	It's actually the most played that was based on a 30 day launch window.
5521000	5525000	So actually the most played PC game of 2013 was League of Legends.
5525000	5526000	Aha.
5526000	5527000	Okay.
5527000	5528000	Alright.
5528000	5529000	Now it makes sense.
5529000	5530000	Got it.
5530000	5531000	I was like, surely League of Legends.
5531000	5532000	I mean, I know Dota 2 is very popular.
5532000	5533000	So is League of Legends.
5533000	5534000	Alright.
5534000	5535000	That makes a lot more sense.
5535000	5537000	And still don't understand the point of using Raptor anymore.
5537000	5539000	Like, it was one of those things where it was cute at first.
5539000	5540000	But now, why bother?
5540000	5541000	What's Raptor's...
5541000	5542000	What's the benefit of Raptor?
5542000	5545000	Let's log back into Xbox 360 Voice then.
5545000	5547000	Well, the whole thing is just like...
5547000	5548000	E-peen.
5548000	5549000	You know, like achievements.
5549000	5550000	Yeah, pretty much.
5550000	5551000	You know, it just kind of like, oh, dammit.
5551000	5553000	You know, Rob's outperforming me in this game.
5553000	5555000	I have to go play this game some more.
5555000	5556000	That's basically it.
5556000	5557000	It's up to the minute E-peen.
5557000	5559000	24 hour, 7 day, a week E-peen.
5559000	5561000	It's cross network leaderboards.
5561000	5562000	Yeah.
5562000	5563000	Alright.
5563000	5564000	Yeah.
5564000	5565000	I'm not sure about the Raptor account.
5565000	5566000	I'm pretty sure.
5566000	5567000	It probably tracks my 360 progress.
5567000	5568000	But, you know.
5568000	5570000	When's the last time you turned that thing on?
5570000	5572000	This week when I played Minecraft.
5572000	5574000	Oh, we were talking about that, weren't we?
5574000	5575000	Yeah.
5575000	5576000	Weren't you paying attention?
5576000	5577000	Sorry.
5577000	5578000	I was actually taking notes for the video.
5578000	5579000	What did you say?
5579000	5580000	That's my legal excuse here.
5580000	5581000	Minecraft.
5581000	5582000	Mine all the things.
5582000	5583000	You know what?
5583000	5584000	Okay.
5584000	5585000	I have to say something else funny.
5585000	5586000	Side note.
5586000	5589000	Julian, when I picked him up from school on Friday, he said,
5589000	5591000	can I play Minecraft at your house?
5591000	5592000	And I said no.
5592000	5593000	Because I've uninstalled it.
5594000	5596000	I remember when you hated Minecraft, but you finally came around.
5596000	5598000	Like, that was some progress in 2013.
5598000	5600000	You finally came around to lukewarm on Minecraft.
5600000	5601000	I enjoy it.
5601000	5606000	I just removed it so that when I do my system stuff, I just cleaned everything off.
5606000	5608000	She needed room for porn, porn, porn, porn.
5608000	5609000	No.
5609000	5611000	I needed room for my fucking Steam games.
5611000	5612000	God.
5613000	5616000	And then also, I was going to say, the most played Xbox 360 game.
5616000	5618000	Of course, total play time.
5618000	5622000	Call of Duty Black Ops 2, followed by Grand Theft Auto 5, and then Minecraft.
5622000	5623000	I thought it was interesting.
5623000	5624000	Oh, there you go.
5624000	5628000	The fact that Grand Theft Auto 5 could jump up that high in gameplay hours for the last,
5628000	5632000	what, two and a half months of the year, compared to everything else.
5632000	5635000	Not surprising, but kind of crazy.
5635000	5641000	Yeah, a little crazy that it's only out for a third of the year, if that, and tops the charts.
5641000	5643000	But at the same time, not really.
5643000	5644000	Not really.
5644000	5645000	All right.
5645000	5647000	So many people freaking playing that game.
5647000	5654000	This was an interesting development this week, and you know, there's been a lot of controversy,
5654000	5658000	and some of it we've talked about here on OLR, some of it we haven't, around Penny Arcade Expo.
5658000	5666000	And I don't really know how to condense this into, but if you somehow don't know the controversy with Penny Arcade Expo,
5666000	5667000	let me just put it this way.
5667000	5673000	The guys behind it have a tendency to put their foot in their mouths every time.
5673000	5679000	And just when you think they might have learned something, or they stick their foot right back in their mouth with some other comment.
5679000	5684000	So that's really turned some people, rubbed some people the wrong way with Penny Arcade Expo,
5684000	5688000	and there's definitely a call where they need to do the right thing, and they need to get the message out there,
5688000	5697000	and they need to be a little more accepting of all types of gaming cultures and so forth.
5697000	5702000	And anyhow, some plans came out this week, some leaked plans or whatever,
5702000	5708000	some leaked information came out this week about Penny Arcade's planned diversity hub and lounge.
5708000	5709000	Oh God.
5709000	5710000	Hold on, I'm not done.
5710000	5711000	I know.
5711000	5714000	This is going to be something that would be in a high traffic PAX area,
5714000	5719000	that would be a resource for PAX attendees to find information related to issues surrounding women,
5719000	5725000	LGBTQ, people of color, disabled people, mental health issues in gaming.
5725000	5730000	It would be a resource for industry professionals and fans to interface in a setting focused on diversity,
5730000	5735000	receive diversity training, learn more about diversity, and meet people from diverse communities.
5735000	5738000	And of course this was all mocked on Twitter in an instant.
5738000	5744000	Hashtag diversity lounge drinks, things of that nature.
5744000	5751000	Basically some folks kind of saying like, wow, they are literally shoving all of this in the corner.
5751000	5753000	So I don't know, a lot of mixed feedback going on this,
5753000	5758000	and we don't know if this is what PAX will actually end up implementing or whatever,
5758000	5761000	but PAX East is coming up before we know it.
5761000	5766000	I made a decision not to go to PAX East that's rooted mostly in finance,
5766000	5769000	but there was a small part of that where I was just like, you know what,
5769000	5774000	I don't know if I can continue to support some of this fuckery as much as I would love to see.
5774000	5777000	I know a lot of the oil army does go out to PAX East, just kind of one of those.
5777000	5782000	I just feel like I suspend the money on having a better experience at Dragon Con
5782000	5784000	or going to some other convention.
5784000	5788000	I don't know, that's where I'm at personally, and this doesn't really exactly change my mind.
5788000	5793000	I have to admit when I read something like this, I'm just like, all right, look,
5793000	5796000	PAX does a lot of panels.
5796000	5799000	Why not do some more panels?
5799000	5804000	To be fair, they've done a pretty good job having a lot of diversity in panels and so forth.
5804000	5809000	They have some of that speaking, and a lot of those groups I just named there
5809000	5813000	tend to usually get a panel at PAX, and I think that's pretty cool.
5813000	5817000	But on the other hand, I'm also like, why does it necessarily need to be a room?
5817000	5821000	I'm not saying that something like this has to take up the entire show floor,
5821000	5826000	but what about something that builds awareness to maybe one of these causes
5826000	5829000	as a booth that's out there on the show floor?
5829000	5833000	What about some great gaming charities that could be out there on the show floor
5833000	5837000	and really getting their information out there to maybe some of the people that need to hear it most?
5837000	5841000	It is a little weird to hear that they want to put it in its own room.
5841000	5845000	I don't know. Any thoughts on this from you guys here in the studio or Loki on the phone?
5845000	5850000	It's like they're throwing the bone out there to people and then shoving it in the corner.
5850000	5854000	I mean, really, it is exactly like that.
5854000	5860000	Not to mention that the guys keep having a tendency to repeatedly shove their foot in their mouth
5860000	5863000	so deep that they're shitting toenails.
5863000	5869000	So I don't know if it's too little, too late, and if they're really going about it the wrong way.
5869000	5876000	I would like to see the public booth. I would like to see something right available at every corner.
5876000	5879000	Here's where you can get your information.
5879000	5887000	The whole thing reminds me of the office when Michael would try to have a diversity day and stuff,
5887000	5892000	and it just goes horribly wrong, like they completely offend everybody in the process.
5892000	5894000	It's kind of like that.
5894000	5898000	There's a part of me, I've got to be honest, there's a part of me that's like, you know what,
5898000	5905000	they don't, and maybe this is a controversial thing I'm about to say, so feel free to present your viewpoint respectfully if you think I'm wrong.
5905000	5910000	But I'm just kind of like, you know, there's a part of me that thinks, you know what, they don't really need to even do this.
5910000	5916000	Just don't go out of your way to be all like, yay, we're going to have diversity day and hold hands.
5916000	5924000	How about you apologize for what you said and mean it and just show through your actions in the future.
5924000	5926000	That would mean so much more.
5926000	5928000	Because that would be too difficult, Rob.
5928000	5930000	I mean, that's the honest thing at the end of the day.
5930000	5938000	I don't need a room. I just need your actions to show that you care.
5938000	5942000	And that's enough for me.
5942000	5946000	But then if they do this, they don't have to change their behavior.
5946000	5948000	They're making their token effort.
5948000	5950000	And that's what bugs me about it.
5950000	5955000	Now, Rama wants to remind us in chat at live.vognetwork.com, it was a leaked memo, things might change.
5955000	5957000	That's absolutely right.
5957000	5962000	SHG100Matt says, tinfoil hat time, I wonder if they leaked it on purpose to see the reaction.
5962000	5964000	Queen Simia says, it's tokenism, I think.
5964000	5968000	See, we're not totally sexist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynist.
5968000	5970000	We put a room just for them over there.
5970000	5975000	That's where I'm just like, you know what, why don't you just show through your actions you're not that way.
5975000	5978000	And then just have a gaming convention and we're good.
5978000	5987000	And to be fair, most corporations, especially a lot of the ones that you are going to have on the floor at your convention,
5987000	5992000	have diversity training as part of their corporate training.
5992000	5994000	You know how this goes, right?
5994000	5995000	Oh yeah, absolutely.
5995000	6001000	I've been working, I worked for what was the money store for like ten years.
6001000	6005000	And we had freaking diversity training damn near every year.
6005000	6007000	Especially if you're in customer service.
6007000	6017000	But yeah, it's just, it's, I'm at a loss because I want to say five different words at one time to describe it
6017000	6019000	and none of them want to come to the floor.
6019000	6024000	So I'm just going to say it's fuckery and leave it at that.
6024000	6026000	Jason, any final thoughts on this?
6026000	6031000	I had exactly the same thought, I had exactly the same point as you in that this seems exceedingly unnecessary
6031000	6041000	when it's not born out of, the big story at the last PAX was not this born out of confrontation on the show floor
6041000	6043000	or something between attendees.
6043000	6045000	Attendees.
6045000	6049000	It was the fucking founder that was making stupid comments.
6049000	6056000	Wasn't it also like outside, just on the internet, not even, I don't remember if it happened a day of the show
6056000	6063000	or shortly after or something like that, but it's like, one, he literally pulled a sorry not sorry on stage.
6063000	6064000	Basically.
6064000	6066000	Oh, I remember that portion of it.
6066000	6072000	That was my impression of it anyway, is that you know, I said sorry for this once but I'm really not sorry.
6072000	6074000	I'm sorry I got caught.
6074000	6076000	Yeah, anyway.
6076000	6080000	Or my favorite thing, I'm sorry my words offended you.
6080000	6085000	Which means I'm not sorry for what I said, I'm just sorry that you called me on it.
6085000	6087000	Yeah, it's your problem, not mine.
6087000	6090000	It seems foolish, it seems unnecessary.
6090000	6098000	It definitely is putting the problem in the problem, quotey fingers, into a corner, whatever.
6098000	6100000	Yeah, whatever.
6100000	6102000	Alright, let's move on.
6102000	6108000	Let's go to a time when gaming was just, it didn't have all this fuckery as Jamie put it.
6108000	6111000	It also didn't have all this diversity, but that's another topic.
6111000	6112000	You know what?
6112000	6116000	That's because everybody in video games was Japanese.
6116000	6118000	Not everybody.
6118000	6120000	Unless the game was pretty certain.
6120000	6127000	But anyway, all that talk aside, it's the classic game of the week when maybe we were just younger and naive
6127000	6129000	and that's really what it is, y'all.
6129000	6131000	It's the classic game of the week.
6131000	6134000	Dark Sakura's gonna jump into the gaming vault and find a classic game that she thinks,
6134000	6139000	hey, you kids should be playing this game this week and if you're not, I can't even with you.
6139000	6141000	Alright, here it is, Dark Sakura.
6141000	6143000	What is the classic game of the week?
6143000	6145000	I will explain it a little bit.
6145000	6148000	I have been playing, I forgot to mention at the start of the show, a shit ton of Namco High.
6148000	6151000	I've beaten it with like five characters.
6151000	6154000	Well, not really beaten it because it's more like a visual novel, but anyway.
6154000	6158000	One of the games I've chosen has a character that is in Namco High.
6158000	6169000	I picked Genpei Touma Den, which we got it over here with one of the Namco Museum games as the Genji and Heike Clan.
6169000	6175000	And over there, it was the Genji and Heike tale of the demon's demise.
6175000	6178000	It's a side-scrolling action game that came out by Namco.
6178000	6184000	It was an arcade game in 1986 and it ran on the Namco System 86 hardware.
6184000	6187000	And like I said, we got it over here as the Namco Museum Volume 4.
6187000	6190000	Or it was The Sea, which I have it.
6190000	6192000	And the game is actually kind of a neat little game.
6192000	6202000	And I like it from an artistic point of view because the game sort of plays like you're on a Yamatoe type landscape.
6202000	6213000	So it looks almost like it's trying to emulate some of the ancient artwork of Japan pre the popularity of the woodblock stuff that a lot of people are used to.
6213000	6219000	So as you go through the game, you have different types of action.
6219000	6227000	You have the small mode, which is standard, big mode with large characters and big boss fights.
6227000	6232000	And then you have a plane mode, which is overhead.
6232000	6238000	You have a torii, which are used to transport you to a different stage.
6238000	6242000	And most stages are featured in the side mode or plane mode.
6242000	6246000	There are multiple torii that can be entered that will take to different routes on the map.
6246000	6248000	In big mode, there's only one.
6248000	6250000	And it's at the end of the stage.
6251000	6266000	So you are playing a historical samurai named Taira no Kagekiyo, which is basically he died in the Battle of Dan no Ura at the end of the Genpei War.
6266000	6271000	And he was resurrected in this to fight Minamoto no Yoshitsune.
6271000	6273000	I've got a lot of Japanese in this.
6273000	6283000	And Saito Musashi Bo Benkei over the Imperial Regalia of Japan, which is the only way to beat Minamoto no Yoritomo.
6283000	6291000	So it's got a lot of different elements of Japanese history and mythology in it, including the Sanzu River,
6291000	6299000	which separates the current life from the afterlife, sort of like the river sticks in Greek mythology.
6299000	6309000	And different mythological characters like Emo, or Emodio, who is the king of the god of the underworld, and Amaterasu, who is the sun goddess.
6309000	6311000	There have been many different versions of it.
6311000	6315000	In 1988, we had the Sharp X68000 home computer.
6315000	6321000	And it was very, very much like the arcade version.
6321000	6326000	We have a PC Engine version that came out on March 16th, 1990.
6326000	6330000	And the PC Engine version has been released on the Wii's Virtual Console.
6330000	6340000	As I said earlier, it was released in the US on Namco Museum Volume 4 as the Genji and Heike clans.
6340000	6348000	Which is probably about the closest, I'd say, translation to the name that we could have gotten over here.
6349000	6356000	There also was an interactive board game that was based off this that used a Famicom cartridge for play.
6356000	6357000	Sounds weird.
6357000	6360000	It was called Genpei Tomiden Computer Board Game.
6360000	6362000	It's not like the Pac-Man board game?
6362000	6366000	I have no freaking clue. I'd have to find this. I'd really like to see it.
6366000	6375000	There was also a sequel called Genpei Tomiden Kan no Ki that came out April 7th, 1992, exclusively for the PC Engine.
6375000	6380000	But it did have an American release that was called Samurai Ghost for TurboGrafx-16.
6380000	6386000	And it is the only one of the games that had been released outside Japan before Namco Museum Volume 4.
6386000	6391000	Kagekiyo has shown up in other games done by Namco.
6391000	6396000	He was a playable character in the WonderSwan color game Namco Super Wars.
6396000	6404000	And in Namco Cross-Capcom, which he teamed up with Mitsurugi from the Souls series and Tarosuke from Shadowland.
6405000	6408000	And some of the other characters have appeared in it.
6408000	6420000	And our most recent one was, of course, Tyra has been in Namco High as one of the dateable characters, which I'm probably going to play him next.
6420000	6426000	And some of the game music was actually remixed for Ridge Racer 5.
6426000	6427000	Oh cool.
6427000	6428000	So there you go.
6428000	6432000	And it's a fun game. I mean, you're watching it right now.
6433000	6435000	And you see the shape of the clouds.
6435000	6438000	That was the biggest thing that indicated that art style to me.
6438000	6442000	And then when I went and found it actually confirmed, I was like, yes, I recognize art style.
6442000	6445000	I got to be honest, I have never seen this game before. Never.
6445000	6449000	And I know it was in some Namco collections. I do not remember it at all.
6449000	6454000	Well, if you would like at some point, I'm more than happy to bring over the sea from my Namco collection.
6454000	6457000	It's a fun game. It really is fun.
6457000	6460000	Well, I just have a billion other classics I got to play to.
6460000	6462000	It's a very interesting platformer.
6462000	6467000	A lot of the imagery in this has reminded me of an old arcade game called Sengoku that I played a handful of times.
6467000	6472000	But I think that's just because Japanese classic warrior mythology.
6472000	6489000	And especially with the way that the imagery is presented, the way that you have, even the dialogue is presented in game as corner top to bottom, left to right.
6489000	6496000	As traditional Japanese artwork would have had a poem or something written on it.
6496000	6500000	Very Kanji heavy too, I noticed.
6500000	6507000	So, of course, the first one I played was the English version that came out on PlayStation.
6507000	6512000	But it's a good game. It's a really good game. Very solid.
6512000	6519000	And I also just laughed my ass off at any of Tyra's scenes that I've seen on Tumblr so far.
6519000	6521000	So I have to play Tyra's next.
6521000	6524000	All right. There it is. Your classic game of the week. What was the title one more time?
6524000	6527000	It was... I just closed the window.
6527000	6528000	You don't remember.
6528000	6529000	It was Genpei Tomiden.
6529000	6534000	Genpei Tomiden. There it is. All right. Your classic game of the week.
6534000	6538000	And that's probably all of the correct pronunciation you're going to get out of me today.
6538000	6543000	All right. We've got plenty more Orange Launch Radio coming up here on this pre-holiday edition of the show.
6543000	6544000	We've got rapid fire news.
6544000	6546000	Special Fugu question of the week tonight.
6546000	6549000	Jason will be reading it. We'll get into that a little later.
6549000	6551000	And some news about Xbox One.
6551000	6555000	And plenty more when we come back. Loki's still there on the phone, right?
6555000	6557000	Yes, I'm here.
6557000	6559000	I just have to check on you once in a while because I can't look at you.
6559000	6561000	Did they find your sister?
6561000	6562000	Not yet.
6562000	6563000	Oh, God.
6563000	6571000	Well, it's not... She was working out in, like, her goat pasture. So, who knows?
6571000	6572000	I don't want a goat.
6572000	6573000	No, you don't.
6573000	6574000	Goats are cute.
6574000	6575000	No, you don't.
6575000	6577000	All right. Well, I hope everything's all right with that.
6577000	6584000	So, we've got plenty more Loki on the phone and plenty more folks here in studio when we come back right after this break with more of Orange Launch Radio.
6584000	6602000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio, live on this Sunday evening, December the 22nd of 2013, with episode number 532 of our show in progress.
6602000	6608000	And just in case we forget to mention it at the end of the show, I just want to wish all y'all happy holidays out there.
6608000	6610000	No matter what it is you celebrate.
6610000	6613000	You might already be done with the holidays like Jamie is.
6613000	6617000	Not technically done because I live in an interfaith family.
6617000	6619000	That's true, as many people do in this day and age.
6619000	6620000	Yes.
6620000	6625000	But whatever it is you celebrate, Christmas, I'm sure many, many, many of you, Festivus, Kwanzaa...
6625000	6627000	And the blessed solstice since it just passed.
6627000	6629000	Solstice was last night, right?
6629000	6631000	Yep. Yule celebration.
6631000	6635000	Whatever it is y'all celebrate, have a good time.
6635000	6637000	And, you know...
6637000	6639000	And I still want a goat.
6639000	6647000	And a thanks to all of you who have supported us, you know, through Here We Are, yet another holiday season together. So thank you, everybody.
6647000	6649000	And trust me, you don't want a goat.
6649000	6650000	Thank you, Logan.
6650000	6656000	I do want a goat so we don't have to mow the lawn ever. And they're cute. Look at their eyes. Their eyes are adorable.
6656000	6664000	Hey, that was my thought. You know, our backyard's pretty overgrown. I'm like, hey, just bring him over. But yeah, it's not that easy.
6664000	6674000	According to the in-laws, if you have one goat, it's fine. They sort of turn into, like, a dog-type pet. But if you have two goats, they turn into assholes. They start plotting against you.
6674000	6681000	She has, like, six. And I think they had more. So I think it's, like, six or seven now that she has. It's ridiculous.
6681000	6683000	Goats! They're so cute.
6683000	6686000	But your sister is a veterinarian, right? Or vet tech?
6686000	6698000	She does lab work at a vet tech place, but she keeps her goats at, like, a friend of my mom's house. He has, like, farm land, and so she has, like, a pasture over there.
6698000	6710000	That's pretty cool. You know, there's a lot of farming in my family, too, believe it or not. My uncle, I don't know how much I should really say about this, but my uncle is, like, a big-time pig farmer.
6710000	6721000	Like, big-time. Like, he was actually, like, president of some big pig-related thing when swine flu broke out. So they interviewed him on the news, and he was, like, literally there on the- I think I talked about this with swine flu first of all.
6721000	6731000	He was literally the guy there on the news saying, don't call it swine flu, and you can eat as much bacon as you want. It's fine. You know, please don't stop buying bacon, because, you know, they're pig farmers.
6731000	6735000	So, yeah, that's my uncle.
6735000	6739000	All you have to say was just swine flu makes the bacon taste even better.
6739000	6750000	That's the family I grew up in right there. And then I think my other uncle on my mom's side is, like, a rodeo guy, but I don't even- we're not super close.
6750000	6766000	When I was a kid and used to go to Dothan, Alabama, and they had a little farm. We actually lived on the farm for, like, two years, so I spent two summers there, legit. But they had two goats, and they were both named Sam. Both of the goats were named Sam.
6767000	6779000	Some comments in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com. Fifth Dream reminding us it's Christmas Eve, Eve, Eve. That is something my sister used to say on the 23rd. She'd always say, it's Christmas Eve, Eve. So, today would be Christmas Eve, Eve, Eve.
6779000	6792000	Let's see, Retertainment in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, celebrate the holidays, including the new holiday, December 20th, the day gay marriage came to Utah. Congratulations, another state on marriage equality. That's amazing.
6792000	6803000	And, as I told you earlier today, in the trying to pass a stay on it, the court rejected the stay. So, go get hitched.
6803000	6805000	Happy to hear it. If you're ready for it.
6805000	6806000	If you want to.
6806000	6809000	If you want to. Don't get hitched just because you can. That's like what Britney Spears does.
6809000	6816000	Yeah. However, it would be completely fair if you wanted to get really drunk and elope.
6816000	6828000	Yeah. Go to have a nice Utah wedding. There you go. All right. Well, congrats to Utah. Congrats to all the newlyweds, no matter what type of couple you're in these days.
6828000	6831000	Just happy to hear all this good news everywhere.
6831000	6839000	All right. We're going to get into some good news and maybe some bad news with some gaming rapid fire topics here. Loki, start us off rapid fire news.
6839000	6849000	All right. So, this week we got another update for Grand Theft Auto Online. They added some capture to flag type gameplay modes. Of course, with their own kind of spin to it.
6849000	6859000	They have Raid, which is kind of like a standard capture to flag. Then they have, you know, bases that you can hold and packages you have to seize and stuff.
6859000	6869000	And then also, content, which I guess is centered around a single vehicle that you capture and have to bring back to your base.
6869000	6879000	So, fun stuff. And then of course, the content creator stuff came out last week as well. So, you know, been trying to make some stuff with that. That was kind of cool.
6880000	6890000	Dynasty Warriors 8 Extreme Legends coming to consoles, at least Sony consoles, in Spring 2014.
6890000	6901000	Of course, Extreme Legends for PlayStation 3 and Extreme Legends The Complete Edition for PlayStation 4 and Vita. So, all bases covered there.
6901000	6908000	And, oh yeah, one of the games I forgot to mention that I played this week, a tiny little bit of, of course, just a tiny little bit. Must stress that.
6908000	6922000	Cookie Clicker got a Christmas update. So, now there's reindeer cookies that you can click on and a crazy looking Cthulhu-esque Santa.
6922000	6931000	And all other sorts of power-ups and stuff you can get in there as well. Christmas tree ornaments and all that fun stuff.
6931000	6936000	So, check it out if, you know, you've left your cookies clicking all by themselves for a while.
6937000	6944000	And the knock-off on the iPhone Cookie Clicker also has Santa cookies right now. So, just saying.
6944000	6952000	With special chocolate milk mode. So, if you're playing the cheap knock-off on iPhone, there's something for you there too. Just saying.
6952000	6955000	Yeah, orange juice right now as my milk.
6956000	6965000	I, there's, I don't know if you've played the iPhone knock-off one, but like there's milk that slowly rises that will increase your multiplier.
6965000	6971000	So, that's why they have like the chocolate milk because it makes your multiplayer like 50 times and all this crazy stuff. So, that's pretty awesome.
6971000	6980000	Alright, well, moving on to some other topics. The game that I kind of thought NES Remakes might be more like, Super Mario Brothers Crossover, but it's not.
6980000	6988000	Super Mario Brothers Crossover has a brand new 3.1 version that is out. And this brings the lost levels into Super Mario Brothers Crossover.
6988000	6996000	You know, like the Japanese Super Mario Brothers 2 lost levels. So, yeah, now lost levels will have 52 levels there with it.
6996000	7004000	348 levels in the game now. They did not change the physics, however, for Mario and Luigi, so it's not necessarily the true version.
7004000	7013000	But, eh, there you go. Whole lots of new levels there for Super Mario Brothers Crossover 3.1. I haven't played this game in a while, but it was a lot of fun the times I did check it out.
7013000	7018000	And I think, wasn't that developed here locally? Didn't we find that out? Like the guy who did it in Sacramento?
7018000	7019000	Yeah, he is.
7019000	7020000	We gotta find him and get him on the show.
7021000	7029000	Also, Konami releasing a new version of Contra. But guess what? It's only in China. At least it is for now. I don't know.
7029000	7034000	But, yeah, Contra Evolution is available in China. It's something for Google, Android or iOS.
7034000	7047000	Konami, excuse me, I think you get this free here on those systems, but in China it's like a full release as opposed to a little version here.
7047000	7058000	I don't know. I haven't checked this game out on iOS, but it's there and it's just the classic Contra game that you had on either the arcade or the NES, but the graphics are a little bit more improved there.
7058000	7064000	But, yeah, you probably won't do very well with it if it's Contra on a tablet, but hey, you can at least check that out.
7065000	7077000	Yeah, as I say that video, they have the Contra Evolution Revolution or whatever that's got PC and Arcade listed on there. I was like, oh hey, PC game? That'd be pretty cool.
7077000	7080000	Maybe coming soon to Steam for $1.99.
7080000	7081000	Yeah.
7081000	7090000	Speaking of Steam and things you can buy on it, Typing of the Dead Overkill is half off on Steam, or at least it was during the holiday sale. I don't know if that's still going.
7090000	7097000	But there's also a brand new DLC pack. You know they've been releasing a lot of these and we keep covering it every week. I don't know. This might be the last one.
7097000	7110000	But we have to mention this one because this Trump, they had Shakespeare, they had Football Manager, but this one, this is the best, you guys. It's the Filth DLC pack.
7110000	7119000	You can now type lines like man meat, furious penis, studded cock ring, always were a cunning linguist.
7119000	7130000	So you can put in those terms into Typing of the Dead Overkill as you blast zombies to cocks. So check that out.
7130000	7135000	That might sell the game for me because I like, um, yeah.
7135000	7138000	This means we need, you like cocks? Is that what you're saying?
7138000	7139000	Not really.
7139000	7149000	We need to do another Let's Play with extra for narrating. I think that's going to have to be a thing there. So we'll get that. Maybe instead of Horde House this week we'll have extra for narrating the Filthy Pack.
7149000	7151000	This would be a cunning linguist.
7151000	7160000	Yeah, it looks like right now it's only $14.99 and then the DLC is $2.99. So it's only 25% off.
7160000	7165000	Wait for it to come down to $9.99. It'll come down to $9.99. Wait for it.
7166000	7168000	Alright, Dark Sakura.
7168000	7173000	Well this doesn't really have anything to do with cock. Maybe lots of vagina.
7173000	7181000	Skullgirls Encore has a Typing of the Skullgirls mode. Totally inspired by the Typing of the Dead.
7181000	7191000	You will type an onscreen word to do your super attacks. If you type it correctly your attack will do 1.5 more damage than usual.
7191000	7197000	If right but not perfect it's regular damage and incorrect will have a 10% reduction on the damage.
7197000	7202000	It doesn't work online or in tournament mode. So Typing of the Skullgirls.
7202000	7210000	Also for anyone who loves to play old Playstation games on your mobile you can now play the original Tomb Raider and it's $9.99.
7210000	7217000	And it is compatible with iOS 7.0 later only for iOS.
7218000	7224000	You know what, I would only care if I could play the second one where I could make her explode or break her neck.
7224000	7230000	And then last but not least, and this is really just more good that the video game community is doing.
7230000	7240000	Microsoft has been putting it out there for the zoo tycoon community to actually do something to raise money for endangered species.
7240000	7247000	Each month Microsoft is launching a zoo tycoon community challenge to help raise money to help these animals.
7247000	7252000	And when the challenge's goal has been reached Microsoft will donate $10,000 to the chosen non-profit.
7252000	7256000	Players will get updates on how the money is spent with reports from Microsoft.
7256000	7265000	So like December 31st this one was released 1000 rhinos into the wild in zoo tycoon and they will donate $10,000.
7265000	7270000	Adopt 1000 Komodo dragons in zoo tycoon and another $10,000.
7270000	7274000	Release 1000 Sumatran tigers and that's what they are.
7274000	7279000	So hey, you know, they're doing something good. Kudos to them.
7279000	7281000	We like to hear about gamers doing good.
7281000	7283000	We like the fuzzy animals.
7283000	7286000	Gaming companies getting people involved and everything.
7286000	7288000	I like Komodo dragons.
7288000	7289000	Good stuff.
7289000	7291000	Red Entertainment says let's play Cocks.
7291000	7294000	He's talking about chickens of course.
7294000	7299000	Alright, let's get into a segment we do here on OLR called the Foogle Question of the Week.
7300000	7301000	Wait, wrong music.
7303000	7304000	180, pull back.
7304000	7305000	There we go.
7305000	7306000	Foogle Question of the Week.
7312000	7314000	Alright, every week we ask a question on our Facebook communities.
7314000	7320000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus community at Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
7320000	7324000	Until they, you know, pull our page because they think it's not really us or something.
7324000	7330000	But anyway, we actually flipped the script a little bit this week because it has been a really slow news week.
7330000	7332000	And I guess we could have asked about the YouTube.
7332000	7334000	I guess we could have asked about something else.
7334000	7335000	But you know what?
7335000	7342000	It seemed like a great excuse for us to do another installment of a segment here on OLR we haven't done in an awfully long time.
7342000	7345000	It's a special holiday edition of Ask Orange Lounge.
7348000	7349000	For real this time.
7351000	7354000	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
7354000	7358000	Well, will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
7358000	7362000	We pulled Facebook and Google and thank God we're still on Google.
7362000	7365000	But we might not be much longer if they keep up this fuckery.
7365000	7366000	Alright.
7367000	7368000	Good times Will.
7368000	7372000	I should honest to God be on Whose Line Is It Anyway?
7372000	7374000	Because I make that shit up on the spot, right?
7374000	7375000	I miss my calling.
7375000	7376000	Wayne Brady.
7376000	7377000	Get down with Aisha.
7377000	7378000	I'm coming for you.
7378000	7379000	Alright.
7379000	7380000	It's not Wayne Brady.
7380000	7381000	It's like, well.
7381000	7383000	Wayne Brady's one of the stars.
7383000	7384000	Alright, anyway.
7385000	7388000	Jason is going to be fielding our FUGL questions this week.
7388000	7391000	Because some of our listeners are asking us questions.
7391000	7393000	Are we doing every question tonight?
7393000	7394000	Or are you just picking some of your favorites?
7394000	7397000	I'll jump around a little bit and see how many we go for time.
7397000	7398000	Pick your favorites.
7398000	7399000	Yeah, for time purposes.
7399000	7400000	Don't drag this out too long.
7400000	7402000	Tech 2030 starts us off with a ringer.
7402000	7403000	Alright.
7403000	7404000	Nothing off limits.
7404000	7406000	Okay, I'm gonna get crazy with this one.
7406000	7407000	Alright.
7407000	7408000	What's your favorite color?
7410000	7413000	My favorite color is dark green.
7413000	7414000	Sometimes dark purple.
7414000	7415000	Depending on my mood.
7416000	7417000	Black.
7417000	7418000	Because it depends on your version of color theory.
7418000	7420000	It's either all of the colors or none of the colors.
7421000	7422000	Loki.
7423000	7425000	Sadly enough, because of this show, I did a lot of orange stuff.
7425000	7427000	So, orange.
7427000	7428000	There you go.
7428000	7430000	I almost bought an orange bike.
7430000	7435000	You know, I always find it, like, one of our super fans who is really wonderful.
7435000	7436000	Misty.
7436000	7437000	If she's out there, I don't see her in chat.
7437000	7439000	She might be, she's probably on a train somewhere.
7439000	7443000	But, hi Misty, if you're out there listening, I always love that she'll see something orange
7443000	7445000	and she'll, like, text me a picture of it or something.
7445000	7446000	She's like, I had to buy it.
7446000	7447000	I just think it's great.
7447000	7448000	Anyway.
7448000	7449000	So, yeah.
7449000	7451000	Your favorite color should be orange, Tech 2030.
7451000	7453000	But if not, then, you know, green, black.
7454000	7455000	Alright.
7455000	7457000	What about my answer?
7457000	7458000	Okay, Jason, what's your answer?
7458000	7459000	What about your answer?
7459000	7465000	You know, without going too crazy with it, what's funny is that I actually don't really have a favorite color anymore.
7465000	7466000	Growing up, it was green.
7466000	7469000	It kind of started to change to blue in the last couple of years.
7469000	7472000	I don't really identify a favorite color anymore.
7472000	7473000	It's kind of weird.
7473000	7477000	But green was the biggest portion of my youth for an incredibly long time.
7477000	7479000	Do you know I had green hair once?
7479000	7482000	I do not think I've seen pictures, so I will go with you.
7482000	7483000	I was in college in Alabama.
7483000	7484000	Definitely did not see pictures.
7484000	7487000	So I was probably about 20 years old and had the top.
7487000	7490000	You know how people now are, like, doing their hair two different colors?
7490000	7493000	Not the ombre thing, but the underside one color.
7493000	7495000	The underside stayed brown.
7495000	7499000	The top was forest green, manic panic, which I don't even think you can get that color anymore.
7499000	7500000	Fifth Dream.
7500000	7502000	I love this comment at the chat room at live.vaudeville.com.
7502000	7504000	Fifth Dream says, let me answer.
7504000	7505000	Let me answer.
7505000	7506000	I have no answer.
7506000	7508000	That's what Jason just did.
7508000	7510000	But, Jason, I was going to say this.
7510000	7515000	Don't you have, you say you may not have particularly a favorite color, but don't you, like, when you go shopping for clothes or something, you're kind of, like, drawn to one color.
7515000	7522000	Like, my friends make fun of me because a lot of my wardrobe is, like, all earth colors, like, brown and, like, I really, and it's kind of true.
7522000	7523000	Like, I wear a lot of brown and green.
7523000	7525000	I wear a lot of brown and black.
7525000	7526000	I wear earth colors.
7526000	7528000	I don't go shopping for clothes.
7528000	7530000	I buy funny t-shirts off the internet.
7530000	7531000	That's just a lot.
7531000	7534000	I go shopping for jeans and that's about it.
7534000	7544000	I do go thrifting pretty regularly and if I'm going to look for something to modify, I tend to look for colors that aren't going to be completely outdated in five years.
7544000	7545000	Alright.
7545000	7550000	My favorite color will be whatever color shoes I wind up getting because I really do need to go shopping.
7550000	7552000	I'm just going on way too long for a freaking color.
7552000	7553000	Ask another question.
7553000	7554000	Another question.
7554000	7561000	P.J. would like to ask, biggest let down title or game related news of the year?
7561000	7564000	Biggest let down title or game related news of the year.
7564000	7570000	Oh, I'd really have to look at, like, some of the stories from this year to remember.
7570000	7572000	I know what let me down.
7572000	7573000	Sorry.
7573000	7574000	Go for it.
7574000	7579000	When my Mass Effect 3 data pad stopped working so I couldn't stay at 100%.
7579000	7580000	True.
7580000	7581000	True story.
7581000	7586000	Because I still, I just uninstalled that thing after having it on my phone for a year.
7586000	7591000	Loki, can you think of anything, a big disappointment or a big gaming news disappointment for this year?
7591000	7593000	Saints Row IV.
7593000	7594000	Ooh.
7594000	7596000	Why did I know he was going to go there?
7596000	7597000	I just knew he was going to go there.
7597000	7600000	I have to stew on this one a little longer.
7600000	7601000	I can't think of anything off the top of my head.
7601000	7609000	Maybe, I intended to go through for the easy answer and say Xbox's original policies.
7609000	7616000	But, you know, to be fair, they did change it and everything's cool now and the new consoles are doing just fine.
7616000	7619000	So, I can't really hate on that too much.
7619000	7622000	Maybe the biggest, I'm going to say this.
7622000	7628000	The biggest disappointment for me this year is third party publishers openly pooping on the Wii U.
7628000	7632000	EA's attitude towards the Wii U is my biggest disappointment this year.
7632000	7634000	I think that would be my honest to god answer.
7634000	7636000	That's a good answer.
7636000	7646000	I honestly don't have an answer to that question just because my involvement, lack of, precludes me from that this year.
7646000	7648000	Not in the new consoles.
7648000	7649000	Get up to speed.
7649000	7651000	You've got the controllers though, you've got the controllers.
7651000	7653000	Yes, I'm contributing in other ways right now.
7653000	7654000	Another question!
7654000	7655000	Another question!
7655000	7656000	I'm getting there.
7656000	7661000	SSJ100mat says, if there were a VoG slash OLRCon, who would you want as the keynote speaker?
7661000	7662000	Ooh.
7665000	7666000	Me.
7666000	7667000	No.
7667000	7672000	I would want, I would want Jason Enos to be one of the speakers.
7672000	7674000	Yeah, I miss him.
7674000	7680000	I don't know if necessarily the keynote, but I just think as far, you know, we have a lot, as far as DDR Community,
7680000	7685000	which remember, this show started as a music game community show, which was in large part to DDR,
7685000	7690000	I think we directly have Jason to thank for that kind of happening in the US in the first place.
7690000	7695000	So I sort of think we owe that debt, if nothing else, to him.
7695000	7700000	So I would hope if there is a con, we can convince him to come say hello.
7700000	7702000	Keynote speaker?
7703000	7710000	I want the guy that plays Seika to Sanshiro to be our keynote speaker and to do it in character.
7710000	7720000	Um, I want Sid Meier to come give the keynote because I'm a horror for civilization and covert action and many of the things he's done.
7720000	7722000	Stop rolling your eyes, Dark Sakura, stop it!
7722000	7724000	I wasn't rolling my eyes, I was looking up.
7724000	7726000	Uh, Loki, you have an answer?
7726000	7730000	Um, I have no idea.
7730000	7734000	Um, the president of Pinkberry.
7734000	7736000	Yeah!
7736000	7743000	Wait, not the co, not the co-founder guy that got arrested for all that fucked up stuff, or got Togori, he did some really fucked up stuff.
7743000	7744000	Not him, not him.
7744000	7745000	Not him.
7745000	7746000	Alright, not him.
7746000	7749000	Alright, uh, Jason, I don't know if you have an answer, but if not, another question.
7749000	7751000	Uh, me? I'm the voice.
7751000	7754000	Yeah, actually, Jason would be the voice that would announce all the speakers.
7754000	7757000	I would definitely introduce the keynote speaker, how's that?
7757000	7763000	Oh, sorry, Redertainment says a keynote address from Rob's mom. I think Bobby Blackwolf should give a speech.
7763000	7765000	Yes, Bobby.
7765000	7772000	Shouldn't, if there's gonna be a keynote speaker, shouldn't Bobby Blackwolf open OLRCon?
7772000	7773000	Hell yes.
7773000	7775000	With commentary by your mom.
7775000	7776000	Alright.
7776000	7778000	Rob, who's that guy up there?
7778000	7780000	There's the definitive answer, Bobby and my mother.
7780000	7781000	Alright.
7781000	7783000	And Travis Donovan, too, to be fair.
7783000	7784000	Alright.
7784000	7787000	Because the name came up, Hunter R. would like to ask,
7787000	7791000	Dearest Orange Lounge, is Pinkberry one of those make-your-own-frozen-yogurt places?
7791000	7793000	It's even better.
7793000	7800000	Better flavor, you don't make it your own, it's kind of traditional, like Baskin-Robbins, behind-the-counter style,
7800000	7802000	but the ingredients are delectable.
7802000	7805000	Fresh, and good, and beautiful.
7805000	7810000	And they're not paying us, so I hate that we keep giving them free advertising, but it is really good.
7810000	7812000	But they friended us both on Twitter.
7812000	7813000	Oh, did they?
7813000	7814000	Yeah.
7814000	7821000	Their base flavor is more tart than your standard yogurt, it's not vanilla, so it's more Greek yogurt style,
7821000	7826000	and I know that might sound a little weird, but trust me, the frozen yogurt is like real fucking good.
7826000	7835000	However, their chocolate is one of the lowest sugar soft-serve yogurts that you can get from anywhere.
7835000	7839000	Yeah, and it is pretty low calorie, unless you get like peanut butter or something.
7839000	7841000	And you can get a mini size, which is perfect.
7841000	7845000	Or you can get it in a cone, if you're feeling like having a fat day, like I do a lot.
7845000	7850000	All right, if there's nothing else to add to that, then another question.
7850000	7852000	Did we get Loki's answer?
7852000	7855000	On what makes Pinkberry different? I don't think there's much you can add to that.
7855000	7857000	Fair enough, yeah, good point.
7857000	7862000	We will then end with the one that I completely lost sight of, and it's in here somewhere.
7862000	7869000	Fifth Dream asks, what is the one game each of the host things has been too ignored and should be played by everyone?
7869000	7873000	In other words, is there a little known game you would force everyone to play if you could?
7873000	7875000	Oh shit.
7875000	7877000	I have really picked the winners.
7877000	7881000	These are questions I wanted more warning on.
7881000	7885000	One game I would make everybody play if I could.
7885000	7890000	Looking at the shelf of games over there.
7890000	7893000	I'm not in my vault, so I really can't say.
7894000	7901000	I'll go for the easy cop-out answer, but it's so true, because I need people to understand why we love the Guardian legend.
7901000	7904000	Yes, well that was what I was going to say, but I knew you'd pick it too.
7904000	7909000	Sure, sure. Loki, is there a game you'd make every- oh wait, no, I'll wait.
7909000	7911000	It's coming to me. It has four letters.
7911000	7913000	It starts with grand and ends with five.
7913000	7915000	It's little known.
7915000	7921000	It's not little known, and no, I would say Earth Defense Forest.
7921000	7923000	That's what I was thinking.
7923000	7925000	Or Excite Truck.
7925000	7927000	Oh yes, Excite Truck.
7927000	7929000	It's actually a very worthy answer.
7929000	7931000	Some folks in chat were entertainment saying Mass Effect.
7931000	7933000	But it's not little known.
7933000	7935000	Yeah, that would be Shane's answer anyway.
7935000	7937000	Shane's not here, so fuck it.
7937000	7943000	Katamari sprang to mind for me pretty much immediately, but I think that's just above the cusp of little known.
7943000	7945000	It had a pretty reasonable bout of success.
7945000	7953000	Believe it or not, if you think about it, we probably have some 17 and 18 year olds that listen to this show that were probably kind of young when that game first came out.
7953000	7955000	They might have missed it.
7955000	7957000	We're getting older by the year.
7957000	7967000	I rather think that I would have said Fantasy Zone, because it is one of my favorite little shooter games of all time.
7967000	7969000	It is my second favorite video game.
7969000	7975000	But it is fairly well known in the classic gaming community.
7975000	7979000	It's a big SEGA title. It's been out forever.
7979000	7985000	So I am going to go with Fantasy Zone.
7985000	7989000	There is a part of me that wants to go super duper old school and say everybody.
7989000	7991000	Some of y'all missed the Atari 2600.
7991000	7993000	Kangaroo!
7993000	7999000	You all need to experience the frustration but yet awesome that comes with playing Sword Quest.
7999000	8001000	Any of them.
8001000	8005000	Airworld didn't come out here. What was the first one that came out?
8005000	8007000	I think Earthworld was the first?
8007000	8009000	They all kind of blurred together for me.
8009000	8011000	That first Sword Quest game?
8011000	8017000	I will tell you, as far as old school Game Boy games that not many people would think of, Revenge of the Gator.
8017000	8019000	Oh yeah, I love Revenge of the Gator.
8019000	8021000	That was a good game.
8021000	8025000	I actually would say Mother 3.
8025000	8029000	I definitely think Earthbound was little known.
8029000	8031000	And playing the whole series is worth it.
8031000	8035000	But Mother 3 is a fantastic game.
8035000	8041000	I've actually not finished it myself but I've seen the entirety of the game beginning to end.
8041000	8043000	That game is just straight up fun.
8043000	8047000	It's battle system has the charm of Mario RPG.
8047000	8050000	Great writing, great music.
8050000	8054000	The story is a bit against the grain, against the cuff.
8054000	8056000	It's quite fun.
8056000	8060000	Seek out this game if you even know what Earthbound is.
8060000	8062000	Obviously it's technically Earthbound 2.
8062000	8064000	It's the same in the storyline.
8064000	8070000	Wait, hold on. Before we wrap, I just wanted to say I had to look it up and it was Earthworld.
8070000	8074000	It was going to bug me. Sword Quest Earthworld was the first one and Fireworld was out too.
8074000	8076000	Wasn't that the one where they had the contest?
8076000	8080000	Where you would win all of this stuff but they never finished the series?
8080000	8085000	And just for the old school O.L.R. people, I also have to throw out there Burger Time.
8085000	8087000	You have to play Burger Time.
8087000	8090000	I would agree with that. That was a fun, silly classic.
8090000	8102000	The hotel that I usually stay at in San Francisco has a little set top arcade, flat top arcade, multi-main type thing.
8102000	8107000	And I always plop down and play Burger Time on it if I'm not doing anything else.
8107000	8118000	We will end with William Murderface asking which game releases are all of you looking forward to in 2014?
8118000	8122000	What is the first big thing on your radar for 2014?
8122000	8128000	Whatever the next Mass Effect is. Because I kind of really don't care about much else.
8129000	8132000	Not exactly a core game but something related to it?
8132000	8137000	It's outside the trilogy story. It's like a new thing.
8137000	8145000	And I love the universe so much that there's still this hopeful little spark inside of me that hasn't been completely stomped on by the writing team.
8145000	8151000	That hopes that there might be something a little bit less human centric out.
8152000	8157000	I'm keeping my fingers crossed. If I'm going to be disappointed, let me be disappointed. Let me be heartbroken.
8157000	8161000	But I still want to see what it is.
8166000	8173000	Believe it or not, Destiny, which might surprise you because I don't usually talk about first person shooters, but I'm really excited to check that game out.
8173000	8179000	And I'm hoping Nintendo gets Smash Brothers out this next year because I'm really looking forward to that as well.
8179000	8182000	Loki, what are you most looking forward to in 2014?
8182000	8186000	I want to check out No Man's Sky because that looks pretty sweet.
8186000	8193000	And then, I don't know. There's not a whole ton I'm actually looking forward to so far.
8193000	8199000	It would be nice if Sunset Overdrive came out because that looked like a really interesting trailer.
8199000	8204000	But then again, so did Fuse, I think.
8205000	8210000	The one by Insomniac that ended up sucking, so I don't know.
8210000	8216000	We'll have to see. I think there's just going to be a lot of stuff that we haven't seen announced yet that's going to be pretty good.
8216000	8221000	I'm hoping too that there'll be something announced at E3 that we just don't know of yet.
8221000	8224000	And I think that is also my answer.
8224000	8227000	You wanted me to ask you the Rupaul's Drag Race question, didn't you?
8227000	8229000	There's a Drag Race question?
8229000	8232000	Locopoco asks, who are you rooting for in Season 6?
8233000	8239000	So far, just based off the videos themselves and nothing else, I think Ben De La Creme is my favorite.
8239000	8242000	His picks were Kelly Mantel and Courtney Act.
8242000	8248000	I think Colton the Act is almost a sure win for the top three.
8248000	8254000	By the way, Courtney Act is Australian, so her name is really Colton the Act.
8254000	8257000	You've got to love that. Come on, that's a great drag name.
8257000	8264000	I think she's too good for the show. I know that sounds really horrible, but she's huge in Australia already.
8264000	8266000	It's just kind of weird, I don't know.
8266000	8271000	I think Kelly Mantel, even though she had her own logo special a couple years ago and also might be too big for the show,
8271000	8276000	I think she's going to do very well too, but I like Ben De La Creme based off the videos.
8276000	8281000	That concludes Orange Drag Radio. Thank you all for your questions.
8281000	8286000	For those of you that actually know, if you actually know what the Reading is Fundamental podcast is,
8286000	8291000	there might be like two people out there listening, that is going to come back this next year, so I'll say that much.
8291000	8294000	Google it or look it up on iTunes.
8294000	8299000	All right, let's move on. We've got more gaming news to get to. Loki.
8299000	8308000	All right, so the first set of indie games coming to Xbox One are going to be hitting March 2014.
8308000	8315000	This is part of that ID at Xbox program that they have there.
8315000	8322000	This includes stuff from Halfbrick Studios, Double Fine, Crytek, and Vladimir.
8322000	8328000	So that's nice that they're finally going to start having some decent indie games on there.
8328000	8334000	Anything in particular that you personally are looking forward to?
8334000	8342000	Not really, because I haven't really seen, I think a lot of it's just going to be ports of stuff that we're seeing already are coming to the PlayStation 4 and stuff.
8342000	8351000	I haven't really heard of any standout indie games, aside from, even though I've purchased it on pretty much every platform,
8351000	8357000	Minecraft would be interesting to see what they do with Minecraft on the next-gen platforms.
8357000	8362000	All right. Yeah, I'm curious to see how Minecraft is on the next-gen platforms, too.
8362000	8366000	I'm thinking it'll be unlimited-sized worlds again, like it is on PC.
8366000	8371000	It'll just be more like PC, but with some of the console enhancements. I think that'll be pretty cool.
8372000	8381000	All right. Well, there was a Killer Instinct tournament that happened, and it caused a lot of news to spread around the internet about Wildfire, about the Xbox One, and some DRM checks.
8381000	8386000	Because everybody's like, did the DRM magically come back to the Xbox One?
8386000	8391000	Because what happened is there was actually this clip going on of a Killer Instinct tournament.
8391000	8399000	And what happens partway through this tournament is that the Xbox One comes up to the dashboard and says, do you own this gamer app?
8399000	8403000	If you have the disc, insert it now. If there's no disc, make sure you're signed into Xbox Live.
8403000	8406000	If you don't have the rights for playing it, you'll need to buy it at the Xbox Store.
8406000	8411000	So everybody was like, oh my God, the Xbox One's doing check-ins, and da-da-da-da-da.
8411000	8418000	Well now, Bobby talked about this on his show a little bit tonight as well, and kind of gave some insight to this, so I'm going to just totally bite off what he said.
8418000	8426000	But basically, it wasn't that the Xbox was necessarily doing an online check-in, because if you think about it, I mean, logically, think about it.
8426000	8432000	It would have already been connected once in the past 24 hours. Why would it suddenly disconnect during the tournament?
8432000	8438000	The problem was that somebody was playing the game on a system that wasn't theirs. They were playing it on a different system.
8438000	8447000	And if you think about it, Xbox and even PlayStation kind of already do that today, so this isn't necessarily something new.
8447000	8450000	It just happened in the middle of the game.
8450000	8458000	Now, not that I'm necessarily defending what's happening here, because that is really weird that it would have allowed the game to launch in the first place,
8458000	8462000	and that it stops the game in progress or what have you. That's a little bit weird.
8462000	8469000	And that there ought to be a little bit of give when you're going to go over to friends' houses and play games or do these tournaments or what have you.
8469000	8478000	But, you know, if you're going to play these games, make sure they're on the Xbox you bought them on, or these things might happen.
8478000	8484000	You can't just go around and take your digital game and download it on all these other different consoles. It isn't going to work that way.
8484000	8487000	It doesn't work that way on the 360.
8487000	8492000	Bobby Blackwolf chimes in and says their 4G dropped. That's what happened.
8492000	8496000	So it was, you know, checking on the internet, checking on the internet, and then it dropped.
8496000	8502000	This happens on my 360 games today, actually, because I had to get my console replaced because of the red ring.
8502000	8511000	And even though I transferred my licenses, for some reason, whenever I play an older game, like I go into Geometry Wars, let's say, that was like the first arcade game I bought on Xbox 360.
8511000	8519000	I go into Geometry Wars, I see the demo title screen for like two seconds, and then all of a sudden it flips to the retail screen.
8519000	8525000	Because what it's doing, it's checking the internet, making sure I really own it, and then it will update my demo copy of the game with,
8525000	8528000	Oh, Green Sky's trying to play it. He bought the game. Here it is.
8528000	8533000	So this already happens on the 360. It's just kind of weird.
8533000	8541000	And Bobby's telling me that the reason why it's still checking is that if I do the license transfer, you still have to delete and redownload the game.
8541000	8547000	Good lord. It's a lot of games, Bobby. It's like 50 games. I'd rather just be online, honestly.
8547000	8552000	And how often am I playing my old 360 games anymore? Once every few months. That's it.
8552000	8562000	So just bottom line, keep the digital rights rules in the back of your head, because it's going to be the same on 360 and these systems.
8562000	8570000	And no, they did not suddenly insert in all these rules that they explicitly said they weren't going to do.
8570000	8579000	So be careful in jumping to conclusions. Gaming journalists, I'm watching you face.
8579000	8584000	All right. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? I've been having a discussion about aliens.
8584000	8590000	Really? Yes. Are they real? No.
8590000	8597000	So I brought up Namco. Hi. You're wrong. I think you're wrong. There's aliens. We just don't know them yet.
8597000	8603000	Star Trek is real. No, but I guarantee you, if they showed up, we'd try to fuck them.
8603000	8612000	What? If fandom is to be believed, somebody would ship them in 30 seconds. Real.
8612000	8618000	Anything can be shipped. I know. Trust me. I know. Especially the ship from Galaga.
8618000	8624000	How's that for transition? Yeah. Namco. Hi. I've been playing it and it's fucking weird.
8624000	8631000	I it's a dating sim. It's more like a visual novel, really less, you know, a dating sim.
8631000	8640000	Although if you really want to just romance somebody, all you have to do is pick them and only them and do all of their scenes and you're guaranteed cute little romances.
8640000	8653000	But you have certain characters that you can romance, like Mr. Driller or Lolo from Klonoa or the Galaga ship, who is awesome.
8653000	8660000	Galaga refers to Galaga in the third person. Galaga is amazing. Galaga says greetings, humans.
8660000	8671000	Of course, when I played it, I got the deluxe set. You can unlock the characters for $1.95 individually if you want to get past the.
8671000	8681000	And you know, I wouldn't want to fucking a sorry. Yeah. I mean, I was trying to talk about Homestuck.
8681000	8687000	I mean, Namco. Hi. Stuck. So anyway, you start off the game.
8687000	8697000	You can you know, you've got all of your Namco characters. You can also pay for premium characters for $1.95 a pop, $4.95 in sets of three or $14.95 for the whole set,
8697000	8704000	which is actually what I did. And I got like the soundtrack and because I did the preorder thing.
8704000	8710000	So I have 18 dateable characters. And like I said, I mentioned Homestuck. There are three Homestuck characters in it.
8710000	8717000	You have Terezi, who I dated first because she's awesome. And then you have Dave Sprite, who made me sad.
8717000	8727000	And James, who was freaking weird. And then after that, I think the next one I did was.
8727000	8733000	Donko, the drum from Taiko No Tatsujin, who starts off on her cell phone in detention.
8733000	8741000	She's like the total valley girl type character. And then I did Richard Miller from Time Crisis, who was kind of weird.
8741000	8748000	Everyone's really just bizarre in this game, but they're all bizarre in an incredibly entertaining way.
8748000	8754000	And like Pac-Man comes out and gives you advice. But the advice is always be true to yourself.
8754000	8762000	Although sometimes the advice is maybe you shouldn't be true to yourself. And like the principal is Dig Dug.
8762000	8768000	And the the detention teacher is King from Tekken. And the only sound he ever makes is a roar.
8768000	8773000	And then he yells at you. It's it's really out there and super funny.
8773000	8780000	And I think the whole thing was well done. And, you know, and for a lot of these games, there's people who may not get all the games.
8780000	8789000	You know, these characters came from, like Albatross and Hitomi and Amazonia.
8789000	8795000	And yes, Fifth Dream posted a picture of Galaga talking to the cousin.
8795000	8802000	You play the cousin of the prince of all cosmos who gets thrown in detention because he rolled up the school into a giant katamari.
8802000	8808000	It's it's just funny. You have to like fight evil Namco high at one point. And they're all robots.
8808000	8811000	And so I didn't realize this game was actually already out.
8811000	8818000	Yeah, it's an HTML five game, which the HTML five was done by a group called Date Naito.
8818000	8824000	And I've actually emailed them to ask them what their licensing costs are for their engine, because I'm trying to do a web comic in Flash.
8824000	8831000	But I would like to be able to do a visual novel style and have it be accessible for people on iOS.
8831000	8838000	So, but yeah, it's it's it's cute. And if anybody wants to see other screen caps from it, you can go to my Tumblr.
8838000	8844000	Kurotobasa.tumblr.com. I might repost some stuff on the OLR Tumblr.
8845000	8850000	So, all right. It's it's fucking Namco dating sim. Good times.
8850000	8856000	We're well, it's we're sort of sort of dating sim, but really more visual novel.
8856000	8860000	All right. A good waste of time. Yeah. Waste of time in a good way.
8860000	8869000	I can sit there for like 30 minutes ago. Oh, and usually actually only takes me that long because I'm doing screen caps because I'm like, what the fuck did they just say?
8869000	8874000	All right. Moving on. Loki, I don't know if your story's on a dating sim, but.
8876000	8889000	No, thank goodness. No, I was talking about the steam machine teardowns, because, you know, just recently the 300 people that made it into the hardware beta received their prototype steam machines.
8889000	8897000	And of course, you know, iFixit somehow got one as part of their teardown pages that they do.
8897000	8903000	And they found out that there's a ton of expensive stuff in there, including a Nvidia GTX 780.
8903000	8912000	Also a Core i5 4570 running at 3.6 gigahertz and pricing everything out.
8912000	8917000	It looks like that that machine runs roughly about $1300.
8917000	8925000	So a pretty powerful little PC. I want one. Yeah, me too.
8925000	8933000	They're going to sell a $1500 TV connected device.
8933000	8941000	I just. That does seem. I just don't know who the audience is for those high end machines.
8941000	8947000	I think the low end ones have more potential to do more business, but I don't know games.
8947000	8951000	Not necessarily. Some of the steam games don't take much, especially the indie stuff.
8951000	8958000	I just this whole thing. Every time I hear like I'm I'm really, really into it.
8958000	8964000	I mentioned in the intro last week that SteamOS was out for hobbyists and system builders. I'm looking forward to it.
8964000	8969000	I'm going to dip my toes in and see if there's something that I can do with it and see what they come up with.
8969000	8977000	I'm very interested in this, but the hardware portion of it, sans the controller, doesn't make a lick of sense to me.
8977000	8992000	We don't plug computers into our TVs. The people that actually plug computers into their TVs are incredibly few in the in the in the larger, you know, in the in the larger community.
8992000	8999000	The things that get plugged into TVs are small, tiny little crap.
8999000	9005000	I've completely forgotten the word home entertainment system, you know, demographics.
9005000	9010000	And I just yeah, I just I'm insanely interested at the same time.
9010000	9016000	I don't understand it. And it's it's going to be a very interesting 2014 for Valve.
9016000	9040000	But that's about all I can say. Well, I'm more interested in kind of the front end, how everything's going to work, because mainly, you know, I would love to have I mean, I'm not necessarily going to buy a thirteen hundred dollar PC, but I'd like to be able to build a PC and have kind of that front end experience that you get with like a console nowadays with, you know, the integration with Netflix and the different apps and stuff that you can put on there and, you know, and have it work.
9040000	9049000	Pretty seamless would be nice, you know, like Steam big picture mode works great. It would be nice if there is non gaming apps.
9049000	9056000	I mean, I know they sell software and stuff. I'm talking about like, you know, Skype and Netflix, Hulu, that kind of stuff.
9056000	9070000	Yeah. Yeah. And like I was talking about with the PS4 controller, I'm very close to turning Steam on to big picture mode by default so that I can just grab my controller, you know, turn it on because it's Bluetooth paired and go to it.
9070000	9079000	It's a nice interface and there's going to be a lot of benefits to it. It's just the machine itself that confounds me.
9079000	9083000	All right. Jason, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.
9083000	9087000	That's right. Well, wait, let me let me sorry. Let me read a quick comment from a chat. Sorry.
9087000	9094000	actdeftatlive.vognetwork.com says, Remember, people, the beta build of the Steam machine is exclusive to the beta and it's not one model of the Steam machine.
9094000	9101000	Well, yeah, we mentioned that's a high end system and that, you know, there's low end systems as well. And maybe that's more of the audience for it.
9101000	9106000	But it's going to be interesting to see how these things, you know, do put up against the console.
9106000	9116000	They can't bring down those costs that much. And I mean, well, you know, you may spend more on the front end buying the console, but you can't argue those deals, man.
9116000	9120000	We'll see. This is very true. All right. Now we'll move on. Jason. All right.
9120000	9125000	X-Men and The Simpsons Arcade have suddenly disappeared from the PlayStation Network.
9126000	9137000	They are still available on Xbox Live Arcade and doubly so, considering that they are also available on the Last Chance on Marvel game sale that Xbox Live is currently running right now.
9137000	9144000	No official word. The polygon has reached out to Konami to figure out why this has happened.
9144000	9152000	But no changes in price on Xbox Live, Xbox Live Arcade, but outright removed from Sony's PlayStation Network listings.
9152000	9157000	Licensing, maybe it remains to be seen that it's so console specific.
9157000	9164000	It could also be that the holidays are delaying activity on Xbox Live. I would be interested to see if that's still the case in two weeks.
9164000	9170000	D-listings do not require human intervention. If they wanted something delisted, it's gone.
9170000	9177000	Either that or, you know, legal, marketing, whoever deals with this at Konami just plain fucked up.
9177000	9178000	Maybe.
9178000	9185000	You delist it. You either schedule a delisting or you take it down. There is no ifs, ands, or buts about this.
9185000	9190000	I'm just taking you back to the Skullgirls stuff last week and it seemed like it was staggered on the two and...
9190000	9196000	That had a contractual end though, so they wouldn't do it before then and everybody was aware that that was actually going to happen.
9196000	9201000	This is just straight delisting for a game that... games that probably don't even really need it.
9201000	9206000	Well, and Simpsons was a PlayStation Plus free game for a while. That's how I got it, which I find interesting.
9206000	9207000	Yeah.
9207000	9211000	Alright, well, sadly, not going to be able to get that anymore.
9211000	9216000	I wonder if it's still on their servers though, so if I delete the game from my drive, can I actually get the game back?
9216000	9219000	In fact, oh shit, I think I did delete it. I wonder if I can get it back. Uh oh.
9219000	9221000	Might be gone forever.
9221000	9223000	Never know what you lose until it's gone.
9223000	9224000	I guess so.
9224000	9229000	Alright, well, we appreciate all the emails we get every week and we try not to lose those.
9229000	9232000	And yes, it's the same theme song for the Mailbag.
9233000	9238000	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the Mailbag head first. Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.
9238000	9240000	They left this goo in here.
9240000	9244000	Maybe you'll be asking us things or maybe you'll be telling us things. It's the Mailbag segment.
9244000	9246000	Dark Soccer, take it away.
9246000	9248000	Um, oh, this one was to me.
9248000	9254000	Dear Jamie, I was offended on your behalf for the email bashing you guys for voicing your opinion on the VGX show.
9254000	9261000	What benefit do people get from writing into talk shows to bash commentators for their thoughts?
9261000	9263000	I wasn't really offended.
9263000	9269000	Oh, and Reagan's policies didn't actually destroy the economy. They saved it from the gas lines of the Carter.
9269000	9272000	Yeah, but it set the pace for the thing we have now.
9272000	9277000	Too much politics. Syntax error. Ready.
9277000	9283000	He also built the foundation for the prosperity. We saw in the 90s it took Clinton and Bush number two to really ruin the economy.
9283000	9285000	And Nickelback doesn't completely suck. They only kind of suck.
9285000	9288000	Thanks to the great show lab rat Y2K.
9289000	9294000	That was a laundry list of internet insult memes right there.
9294000	9300000	I could argue the politics behind that with some hard numbers, but I will not.
9300000	9305000	Got one from CK Ender.
9305000	9315000	Hey, OLR. I'll start by saying I've been a loyal podcast listener for about two years and I hope you'll keep doing what you're doing as you guys are an integral part of my Monday afternoons.
9315000	9321000	Hopefully I won't be criticized too harshly on grammar, but something I heard on the show this past weekend, 12, 15, 13, stuck with me.
9321000	9326000	I understand that this topic is too political to read on the show, but I felt like I had to write this.
9326000	9333000	When you folks mentioned the NSA is spying on our MMOs, I felt like there is a bit of misinformation on the lack of information you've been provided with.
9333000	9342000	There's a more global reach to what they are doing. It's not only to listen for communications of any terrorist activities or things of that nature.
9342000	9351000	It's a known fact that in 2011, North Korea formed several farms for Walgold, which it was selling the proceeds of funding their nuclear weapons program.
9351000	9353000	Yeah, there was that too.
9357000	9365000	The practice is comparable to diamond trafficking from Africa to fund warlords or the opium trades in the Middle East funding any of the terrorist groups there.
9365000	9380000	Now I'm not employed by the NSA or any government agency for that matter, but it's been speculated that what they are doing is making purchases from these gold sellers and tracking the funds in an effort to shut down the operations and thus limiting the funds of our national adversaries.
9380000	9388000	Sure, people may think it's a waste of taxpayers monies to have people sit around and play well, but frankly, if it can help financially disarm a nuclear program, then why not?
9388000	9390000	That's a very good point.
9390000	9395000	The age we live in is not only an age of physical conflict, but wars are fought in cyberspace as well.
9395000	9401000	The fact that this is just coming to open news does not mean it's not something that has been going on for ages.
9401000	9410000	The example I cited earlier is not the only one. China has been using prisons to farm gold for sellers and several MMOs, while being, of course, the predominant one due to its population.
9410000	9419000	Now once a player purchases from any gold seller, it opens them up for identity fraud, thus providing further resources such as additional funds, social security numbers, ID, and things of that sort.
9420000	9427000	And as tensions grow tighter in international affairs, it's reasonable that the government looks into this. Think of all the folks who buy gold on a daily basis.
9427000	9436000	Players may feel they're getting ahead in a video game, but they may also be unknowingly funding nuclear warfare, foreign governments, and any other number of illicit trades or activities.
9436000	9442000	Can I stop here for a minute just real quick, just because I have to say this, because as a big time MMO player and all this, this really bugs me.
9442000	9452000	People need to stop buying gold online. People need to realize what, and I don't necessarily think every time they're buying gold they're necessarily funding all of this.
9452000	9460000	Not to discredit the emailer's opinion, because I think it's a very well thought out point, and I think this emailer brings up some good points that are completely valid.
9460000	9470000	But I just think we need, as MMO players, to stop buying gold in the first place, because not only is it necessarily funding this stuff, but it's funding the theft of accounts.
9470000	9478000	It's funding these companies that will do anything to get the gold in game, including compromised accounts, and you're usually putting your own self at risk.
9478000	9484000	Do not buy third party currency in these games. You are part of the problem if you're doing that.
9484000	9488000	I had to get that off my chest because it's a huge pet peeve of mine.
9488000	9498000	I'm with you on that one too, but I do have to say that the gold farming scheme from North Korea ended up not being a very big contributor to their programs.
9498000	9504000	Make it not worth it. That's what I'm saying. We all have to take that responsibility. Make it not worth it.
9504000	9509000	If I'm right, I believe it was abandoned, so the information went. Anyway, let me get back into, where was I?
9509000	9517000	So to say, at the NSA there are a bunch of spies spying on Americans, as some people have, is not entirely accurate.
9517000	9527000	So with that, I wouldn't say they are looking on the average player who could leak information or communicate with terrorist cells, but to limit the financial gain of any group or nation who wishes to fund themselves in this nature.
9527000	9539000	And that's a good point. But I don't think, however, that the attempts to do so in the past have been as successful as they were probably hoping it would be.
9539000	9541000	That's my thought, but I'll continue.
9541000	9549000	Maybe if there was a little less transparency, there'd be more people kind of quick to believe that if they could see this value that you're pointing out.
9549000	9558000	But to be fair, I mean, we're kind of making assumptions to agree with this emailer, too. There's assumptions all around, right?
9558000	9561000	Well, let me read the next part.
9561000	9568000	As for the right to do this, a thing that happened shortly after 9-11 called the Patriot Act. Oh, that's a whole other can of worms.
9568000	9574000	The bill passed with very little contest from anyone praised by millions. Those who spoke out against it were chastised and berated.
9574000	9582000	It essentially gave the NSA, I'm going to insert a word because I think it was left out, power to do whatever they wish in the defense of terrorism.
9582000	9592000	While I do not know where the hosts of the show stand on that topic in particular, we sit here 12 years later chastising the NSA for doing something the nation encouraged them to do in the first place.
9592000	9601000	I myself was completely against that because it was it seemed like a big knee jerk reaction, as many people in this country are apt to do.
9601000	9610000	While I don't have a problem with surveillance, as long as there is transparency that the surveillance is happening, I'm perfectly fine with that.
9610000	9621000	I would have no problem with CCTV all over the place, because honestly, the only people who should be worried about having their stuff tracked are people who have something to hide.
9621000	9628000	Not all I mean, not to again, not to get too political, but just something to think about. Not all surveillance is necessarily bad.
9628000	9636000	Here's an example. I like it when the mall parking lot has surveillance, so that if something happens to my car, you have it on tape.
9636000	9650000	Or what about for those hotels that have CCTV and caught, you know, murders happening or, you know, people being attacked? What about that whole, what's that called the knockout game thing?
9651000	9658000	But when, but anyway, but you know, when you're going to the mall, maybe the criminals are too dumb to remember, but you know, you're probably going to be on film.
9658000	9663000	But it's when that privacy, that reasonable expectation for privacy is breached that people get pissed off.
9663000	9668000	And I think a lot of people assumed that the cybering they were doing in MMO games was private.
9668000	9681000	Well, honestly, and I'm just going to say this right now. I have no problem with having my dirty laundry out there, because honestly, the fuck they didn't care.
9681000	9682000	Well, let's get started, girl.
9682000	9692000	No, no, no. I don't think you know what I mean. You know, if, if they have my juvie record from when I was in high school.
9692000	9694000	You were in juvie? You're hardcore.
9694000	9695000	Yes, I was.
9695000	9696000	I didn't know that.
9696000	9697000	Yes, I was.
9697000	9702000	Because my mom was not able to handle me because I was a big fucking brat and a lot smarter than she was.
9702000	9703000	Okay.
9703000	9705000	End of story. I mean, that's how it is.
9705000	9707000	She will freely admit she couldn't handle me.
9707000	9711000	And so I went, I was a perfect little angel and they're like, what the fuck she's doing here?
9711000	9714000	And send me back. That's seriously how it went.
9714000	9716000	And I ran away from home a couple of times, cause fuck that place.
9716000	9718000	In closing,
9718000	9720000	The cmail got a lot. All right.
9720000	9722000	I don't care who knows that.
9722000	9724000	It's part of who you are now.
9724000	9725000	Everybody's got something.
9725000	9727000	It made me the awesome person I am today.
9727000	9733000	So in closing, I do love the show and appreciate that you give everyone a voice and remain subjective.
9733000	9737000	I will happily continue to listen so long as the show continues to be open minded.
9737000	9740000	Provide me with hours of video game news and overall entertainment.
9740000	9741000	Thank you so much.
9741000	9743000	CK, CK Ender.
9743000	9746000	And for the record, I was not a troublemaker in school.
9746000	9750000	I got in one fight that anyone saw that had a witness.
9750000	9752000	Would you say your mama got scared?
9753000	9755000	By me having one fight?
9755000	9757000	Oh, no, I know what you mean now.
9757000	9759000	No, it wasn't Fresh Prince.
9759000	9762000	No, and I didn't have lots of visits to the principal's office.
9762000	9764000	My problems were strictly at home.
9764000	9769000	But there was this one girl who was just irritating the shit out of me.
9769000	9774000	Throwing, cause I was the, you know, the gothy geeky girl that no one liked.
9774000	9779000	I mean, until I just made myself a complete nuisance and made friends with everybody because I could and joined every club.
9779000	9781000	It was my revenge.
9781000	9785000	But finally one day she like pushed me in the hall and I turned around and punched her in the face.
9785000	9787000	Like hard.
9787000	9789000	I think I cracked her cheekbone actually.
9789000	9794000	But she wouldn't tell anybody that happened and one of the janitors saw it and they had been seeing it happen.
9794000	9798000	And they're like, good for you. I'm not telling anybody what happened.
9798000	9803000	Well, to go back to the email, I just will say I have an open mind with that email.
9803000	9806000	Not to suck up, but just, you know, at the end there, I do have an open mind at the email.
9806000	9808000	I think it was a well presented perspective.
9808000	9809000	Thank you.
9809000	9815000	It paints a very good alternative to something that has been a truth for the last decade.
9815000	9823000	And not just the oh god NSA spying that every governmental black box is being shoved into in the last year.
9823000	9827000	It paints a good devil's advocate perspective we weren't able to do last week.
9827000	9832000	I will say though, we do have some chat comments of course over at live.vognetwork.com
9832000	9835000	Let's see, what was the comment about?
9835000	9840000	Ah, mm2k in chat says, okay, that's World of Warcraft, but what about their Xbox Live spying?
9840000	9842000	What's the justification?
9842000	9849000	Dungeon Buster says, if it involves telecommunications, you can always assume that there will be someone out there trying to find a way to tap it.
9849000	9852000	NSA has had its wrists slapped as far back as the 70s.
9852000	9855000	There was congressional outrage and then nothing happened until the next scandal.
9855000	9857000	This is not their first rodeo.
9857000	9860000	Rama says they've been doing this for years and now people are acting out about it.
9860000	9862000	Fuck out of here.
9863000	9865000	Interesting perspectives all over.
9865000	9868000	Let's move on to the next email though for time's sake.
9868000	9871000	Well, that was actually the end of that email regardless.
9871000	9873000	So thank you for the well thought out email.
9873000	9876000	We have two left. One of them is still UT, but it's not long.
9876000	9877000	Hey guys, first of all...
9877000	9879000	Good job editing first off.
9879000	9882000	First off, count me among the people who actually like Nickelback.
9882000	9886000	Not the greatest band in the world, but they're enjoyable enough and don't deserve nearly the level of crap they get.
9886000	9888000	Next email.
9888000	9889000	Shut up.
9889000	9890000	I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
9890000	9891000	Shut up.
9891000	9897000	While the show is mostly enjoyable, I have to bring up the continued ignoring of all the other services while looking at the feed of Gabe Neal.
9897000	9902000	You know what? I actually like Steam, so I'm using what I like, so whatever.
9902000	9907000	While I don't ask that you ignore Steam sales, they're clearly exciting for Steam's user base.
9907000	9914000	But the way you and most other games media go on, people would be forgiven for thinking that Steam was all that mattered in the PC space.
9914000	9925000	Meanwhile, you guys are ignoring the massive GOG holiday sales, where over 600 plus titles going up to half off are the massive 48 hour free Fallout giveaway they did.
9925000	9927000	There are also...
9927000	9929000	I didn't know about it until you just said that.
9929000	9931000	There are also sales on...
9931000	9932000	I took advantage of that.
9932000	9933000	What's that? Loki?
9933000	9935000	I took advantage of that.
9935000	9936000	Why didn't you tell me?
9936000	9938000	It's fine.
9938000	9941000	There are also sales on Indie Game Stand, Humble Store, and Desura.
9941000	9949000	Recently, the only time you guys have ever mentioned anything other than a Steam sale was not on Steam sale, was basically developers trying to drum up support for getting greenlit.
9949000	9958000	By the way, there was one that CatastrophicMoggie linked me to, that I can't remember, it was a UK site that takes international funds, but had a Doctor Who game on there.
9958000	9962000	That I was very close to getting, but I cannot for the life of me remember the URL now.
9962000	9970000	I just want to say though, you mentioned Humble, or the emailer mentioned Humble Store, and we cover almost every single Humble Bundle that comes out, because they're always such great deals.
9970000	9971000	And they give Steam keys.
9971000	9972000	Yeah.
9972000	9990000	And I'll mention that the last Steam sale, or maybe the one before last, I was mentioning a lot about Amazon had better deals, and even I think Gamefly was doing some deals and stuff that were better than what was on the Steam store, and there's a lot of alternatives out there.
9991000	10006000	I'm sure there's more to come, but just a blanket statement, the reason why Steam tends to get the most coverage is Steam is the most prolific, and not to belittle what the other stores are doing, but keep in mind that Steam is trying to do things that are beyond the storefront.
10006000	10014000	And I love good old games. I think it's great that there's a method set up for some of those classics. I love my classics.
10014000	10030000	I love good old games, and I'm glad to hear they're having sales and a lot of that stuff is available, but keep in mind that Steam also is pushing things forward with the trading card thing, with the family sharing, with the operating system.
10031000	10044000	And even though you might not necessarily be a fan of any of that, you can't deny that these are things that are pushing stores in general in another direction. That's why they tend to dominate the coverage.
10044000	10058000	It's a little bit of a two-edged sword, and I know what he's getting at. You make a very fair point in the sense that there is a lot of non-monetary news like Steam Machine announcement and everything else that's been happened.
10058000	10080000	Yes, Steam does a ton of new things that are making waves in the news. That said, I said just myself today, I picked up Electronic Super Joy for $1.50 and You Don't Know Jack for $5, and we do off-the-cuff these games that we got for dirt cheap from Steam way more often than any other vendor out there.
10080000	10095000	So I 100% agree with his point. I interject the fact that news is important too, but I completely agree that we definitely do bias Steam for our look at our deals, look at our steels kind of thing.
10095000	10103000	Three comments. SSJ100Matt says, we've mentioned GOG in the past. Keep in mind he does have a deep dislike towards Steam.
10103000	10112000	Brad from Pod Culture says, 75% of my Steam stuff comes from the humble bundles and the rest from huge sales they have. And Fifth Dream says, Indie Royale.
10112000	10120000	Yeah, I think I bought one of their bundles once. But anyway, not to belittle the email, it's a fair point that don't all sales deserve equal coverage.
10120000	10132000	And I think this show sometimes, and this has come up on another topic, tends to be a reflection of what gamers are talking about. And Steam, look at whatever gaming blogs are out there.
10133000	10146000	Steam does typically dominate that coverage. But I'm all for, you know what, if there's this great indie thing going on and you guys email in about it or tweet us or get it to our attention, I'm all about getting this stuff exposure. Absolutely.
10147000	10159000	We have no problem mentioning any of this. It just happens to be whatever we've kind of... And honestly, there's just sometimes I pull up Steam just to peruse their, you know, library, find something completely bizarre.
10159000	10166000	And go, that's freaking weird. Like that... What was that game, Loki, the ballpoint shooter?
10167000	10181000	Let's see, that was... Because I bought it. Look it up now because I don't remember. It was ballpoint, ballpoint universe infinite. It was one of like some green light game that looked pretty cool.
10181000	10191000	It was just a neat concept. So it was like two bucks click. You know, I had that lovely wallet. Thank you, Loki. You're welcome. I have used it all up yesterday.
10192000	10207000	To continue with the email, which is nearly done. Again, I feel the need to reiterate that I don't have anything against people who like Steam. However, the media blackout on anything that isn't Steam only serves to undermine what should be an open platform, essentially turning it into a Valve console.
10207000	10216000	Well, I hope you guys don't take this as offensive. And I rarely do. No. Though I imagine people are already shit talking me in your chat.
10217000	10230000	Only a little bit, but not really. I wouldn't say shit. No, I wouldn't either. I put it around the line of a juicy fart. I'm kidding. I actually have zero problem with RawsteelUT personally.
10230000	10245000	When points are presented succinctly like this. He makes good points that may not always be popular. Yes. And I'm all for hearing the points that may not be popular when they're presented in a tactful manner.
10245000	10258000	Yes. It has to go to tact. When it's fuck you, you fucking fuck, I'm not going to hear it. But he doesn't do that. No. And see, I have no problem with information being presented to me that may be kind of the opposite of what I think.
10258000	10267000	As long as it's presented in an intellectually and fact-based manner. And that's kind of two emails tonight that have done that. I know. And I love it. I freaking love it.
10267000	10283000	I mean, that's why I actually look at progressive Republican websites. I don't know if I told you that. To look for the conservative point of view. I listen to conservative talk radio. Done from an intelligent manner. So, anyway.
10283000	10289000	Unfortunately, what I hear isn't always intelligent, but some of it's pretty good. But anyway.
10290000	10303000	Just know that I still enjoy your show. I'm just asking for a teeny bit more fairness. Regards, Ross till UT. P.S. I also love me some Lady Gaga. I'm not a huge fan of Beyonce, though. You were entitled to that opinion.
10303000	10316000	Okay, his music tastes are redeemed a little bit, at least. I just like calling Beyonce, Bejesus. Yeah. Bejesus. No, because that was Bejesus and Ramona. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
10316000	10337000	So, I can't go there. I have to call her Bejesus. Those were my books growing up. Or if we were going to do the J with the Y sounds as Bejesus. More emails? Yes. Last one. Last one. I think. Hi, OLR. Hi. Hi. I'm sending you a very last minute email this week with a timely theme with a question and response to my own question. Really?
10338000	10353000	Now, here we go. Ellipse. Now that the Steam Winter Sale is underway until 1-3-14, what five games per person response that are on sale you think everyone should buy provided that they don't already have said games and that they actually afford to buy them?
10353000	10365000	You have to appreciate the irony of this email. I fucking do. I fucking do. Even Ross Steele, even though you're sitting there rolling your eyes to the back of your head right now, you have to appreciate the irony.
10365000	10379000	There are three letters on Ross Steele, UT's forehead right now, and it's S-M-H. All right. Anyhow. Okay. Well, I will go ahead and read our readers in a spazzinator, by the way. Yes. A rage-inator now.
10379000	10393000	For me, I recommend the following games in no particular order. Flat Out, Magic 2014 Special Edition, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, Strike Suit Zero Mega Bundle, and Pinball FX2 Tables. Any or all of them. Any and all of them.
10393000	10407000	I don't know, Rob. What do you say? Civ V, Spelunky, Rogue Legacy, Super Hexagon. Really?
10407000	10423000	Which I haven't talked a lot about on this show, but that fucking thing is addicting as hell. And Path of Exile in the free-to-play section.
10423000	10437000	I'm probably going to go with The Stanley Parable, because it's on sale right now. The Angry Video Game Nerd game. It's a pretty fun little platformer, especially if you're a fan of his reviews.
10437000	10449000	I will also go with DuckTales. It's on sale. Even though I already have it, I'm just saying that for people who don't have it right now, it's on sale, so go get it.
10449000	10474000	What else was I playing? Bioshock Infinite, which I haven't started yet, but I'm still excited about playing it. I'd actually say Dragon Age Origins, because it's five bucks now for whatever the great version is. I have me some elves to play as.
10475000	10483000	Loki, I don't know if you can think of five Steam games, or after the email before, any PC platform games that are worth checking out right now?
10484000	10494000	I would probably go with... It's tough, because depending on what you have already. Borderlands 2, if you don't have that already. Bioshock Infinite.
10494000	10516000	Probably... Let's see... Skyrim, if you don't have Skyrim. Just Cause 2. Only when it goes on the flash sale, because it's only... It's funny, it was on sale for more than it is now on sale for.
10516000	10525000	But just because of the multiplayer mod. I guess maybe Surgeon Simulator 2013.
10526000	10527000	Jason?
10528000	10535000	My overlap is pretty funny, but You Don't Know Jack, Starbound, Rogue Legacy, Just Cause 2, and Papers, Please.
10536000	10546000	Oh, I need to check out Papers, Please myself. Also, Tech2030 in chat says, even though people don't call it a real using quotey fingers game, I'm gonna say Gone Home. That's another good pick.
10547000	10548000	Yeah, I need to start that.
10549000	10550000	Alright.
10551000	10553000	If anybody out there doesn't have the Stanley parable, freakin' get it.
10554000	10558000	It's on my list of things to check out. I have it. I bought it in the last sale. Just things to check out during this week.
10559000	10561000	I don't remember if I actually picked it up or not. I know I want to. I know I want to check it out.
10562000	10563000	It's eleven bucks right now.
10563000	10571000	ActDeaf suggesting Dust and Elysian Tail. And some folks in chat commenting, Loki, are you wrapping a present in the background? Because we can hear it.
10572000	10573000	My wife is.
10574000	10575000	Hi, Nelly!
10576000	10580000	Merry Christmas to whoever. You might just want to mute yourself locally on Skype, Loki, when you're not talking just so we don't hear the wrapping.
10581000	10582000	That's alright.
10583000	10585000	It takes some getting used to when you do it in person for so long.
10586000	10590000	Alright, where else are we at? That's it for that email, right?
10591000	10592000	That was the last email.
10593000	10601000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future. And hopefully we'll get some nice, like I would love to see two emails that counter each other back to back.
10602000	10604000	We need more of that in future weeks. That's always hilarious. Those are my favorite.
10605000	10608000	Some other, just some more comments from chat. And this is just PC gaming in general, really.
10609000	10614000	William Murderface saying, don't forget Guild Wars 2 if you're looking for a different MMO experience. I think they're running a promotion right now.
10615000	10618000	I got an email from them. That might be directly through ArenaNet for that.
10618000	10628000	Cial says Reprisal is a good populist clone that's still being worked on. Did I say Act F's Dust and Elysian Tail? If I didn't, then I said it again, I guess.
10629000	10630000	Alright.
10631000	10632000	Divekick.
10633000	10638000	I'd also say Duke Nukem, remember Duke Nukem 3D I think was down to 2 bucks, like the old school one. And we have multiplayer in beta now.
10639000	10641000	It might be in the flash sale at 2 am. I know I'll be up checking.
10641000	10650000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week. Because we're mad, even though it's the holidays. The holidays bring out the worst in us.
10665000	10667000	F you Rob, because frivolous.
10668000	10680000	No, right now my voice is kind of going out and I have stuff I have to do this week. And also I'm a little bit jealous that my computer hasn't been upgraded when Vans was.
10681000	10688000	But I understand our friend that was helping us out has become quite ill and it's going around. So just feel better soon.
10689000	10690000	Soon George.
10691000	10694000	You're awesome for doing this for us and thank you for helping us pick out bits of our computers.
10694000	10697000	Feel better George. We have some little banter on Twitter now and again.
10698000	10703000	By the way, I'm going to have like 50 bajillion USB ports on the front of my computer or something like that.
10704000	10712000	Nice. I'll go next. My FU of the week goes to, I think I pulled a muscle last night while I was sleeping because I was super drunk last night.
10713000	10721000	Some of y'all are going to think I have a problem. I'm always responsible. I wasn't driving or anything. I was indulging because of the holidays.
10721000	10727000	But yeah, I was out with grandpa last night from Wardhouse. That's all I have to tell you. All right.
10728000	10733000	And yeah, I think because of that I slept really weird, but I didn't have a hangover today and Alan did.
10734000	10739000	So I will say thank you to whatever is out there watching over me for not giving me a hangover.
10740000	10741000	Bless your hydration and your liver.
10742000	10746000	Yeah, trying to teach me a lesson. Yeah, I did have a bottle of water before I left the place. That was probably smart.
10746000	10749000	I will tell everybody this just a piece a piece of advice.
10750000	10764000	If you take a B 50 complex and drink a glass of water before you're going to have a night of frivolous drinking for the low drinking to you are less likely to have a hangover and also invest in ginger pills because they do help with nausea.
10765000	10767000	About a B 52 complex.
10768000	10772000	SGA 100 Matt in chat says we got to get grandpa an OLR. Actually, it's funny you bring that up.
10773000	10779000	We are he offered yesterday to do a live show from San Francisco at his place.
10780000	10784000	And I actually think that's something we could swing because ironically enough, Jason's in San Francisco right now.
10785000	10790000	So we just down the street for him. So I'm thinking around the time that Loki's gonna be out because the baby's here.
10790000	10796000	That might be a good time for Jamie and I to get in the car go to San Francisco. We might actually do that as long as I haven't started my job.
10797000	10802000	So we'll see what we it is actually a possibility in our roadshow because we're in San Francisco.
10803000	10807000	We might be able to get some really great guests in studio who else is going to be there.
10808000	10813000	Yeah, no, I know. Yeah, so it's on the list. That's all I'm going to say.
10814000	10816000	Loki, your turn.
10817000	10823000	All right. I guess F you to my mouth because it's still a little bit sore from surgery.
10824000	10826000	It's almost done. I can eat food now.
10827000	10829000	All right. Glad to hear you're getting better though.
10830000	10839000	Jason, if you did a stupid cough, I still can't quite kick and has also seemed to want to be more prolific despite cough drops in the last 30 minutes, hours, something like that.
10839000	10844000	I'm sure all this talking is not exactly helping it terribly well, but you know, whatever.
10845000	10851000	F you to money again, just kind of in general, but more specifically, F you to GE Financial.
10852000	10858000	They're dumb and the fact that they make it so hard for me to be able to actually see bills and manage finances.
10859000	10864000	You're making it hard. You're going against the ability for utilities to actually make things easier.
10864000	10869000	Credit, you know, debt planning, that kind of stuff. GE Financial, F you.
10870000	10881000	Lastly, awkward moments in public. I was at the post office and there were customers that decided to get into not literally, but verbal fisticuffs with each other.
10882000	10889000	And it was insanely awkward and I had to make sure that I didn't want to jump in and try to pacify it because I would not have pacified it.
10889000	10894000	I wouldn't have done anything, but I would not have pacified it. I just would have gotten involved.
10895000	10906000	There is inevitably a mental illness that spearheaded a large portion of this, which is unfortunate, but the moment itself, F you.
10907000	10915000	Alright, let us start to wrap up the show here with just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
10915000	10921000	And yes, you can still call 1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, but we're not there just yet.
10922000	10923000	We have a couple more stories for you guys first. Loki.
10924000	10929000	Yes, and since we talked about the VGX over the last few weeks, the final numbers are in.
10930000	10938000	They had 1.1 million views, which exceeded their expectations, and they said there was a lot of great feedback that came out of it.
10938000	10950000	And sure, there's people calling for the date and time of my suicide, and this is Jeff Kiely, but there were people who also said very constructive things about the show.
10951000	10957000	So it sounds like it was a success and they're planning on doing it next year as well.
10957000	10969000	People from 109 countries tuned in, average viewer spending 32 minutes watching it, which is funny because it's about the time I watched it, about 30 minutes.
10970000	10974000	So you were Joe average in that case?
10975000	10976000	I guess so.
10977000	10978000	Is that your cat?
10978000	10988000	That is my cat. She just got let out of, because she was getting into all the rapping stuff, so we had the locker in the middle bedroom, and she comes out and does her cry and stuff.
10989000	10990000	Aww.
10991000	10993000	Yeah, she's a douchebag sometimes.
10994000	11001000	So it sounds like the VGX was really well rated, so it probably is coming back next year, despite anything we might have said that week aired.
11002000	11005000	Maybe without Joel McHale this time, would be my guess.
11005000	11011000	Yeah, or more like the version that was on TV, which was totally edited and different, but we'll see.
11012000	11021000	They should do Ayesha Tyler or something like that, because she's actually kind of into games and stuff, and I think that would be pretty good.
11022000	11025000	Maybe give some comedy lessons to Jeff there.
11026000	11030000	I'd love to see Ayesha Tyler involved with that, that would be fun. We'll see.
11030000	11035000	Alright, lastly but not leastly, a story on the Atari 2600.
11036000	11048000	Well, okay, it's not really like the console, there's nothing new happening with the console, but there's a documentary being made about the game industry crash of 1983, which really took out the Atari 2600.
11049000	11051000	And then, of course, they buried all the cartridges in the desert.
11052000	11057000	Well, they actually made a documentary about this, and I seem to remember talking about this on a show before, that this documentary was in progress.
11057000	11067000	Well, the Canadian film production company Fuel Industries actually is going to this landfill to try to find all the cartridges, although you're going to find a bunch of melted plastic.
11068000	11078000	But anyway, this whole thing is going to happen from this film company, and they're actually going to release a documentary on Xbox on 2014.
11079000	11082000	This is through the new media company that Microsoft has, Lightbox.
11083000	11088000	So this is one of those, I guess, maybe Xbox exclusive programs things to kind of compete with Netflix.
11089000	11099000	I mean, Netflix does exclusive documentaries, they're really heavily promoting their Mitt Romney documentary they're going to be doing about how they were there when it's on camera when he found out he lost the election.
11100000	11101000	So that's going to be in a new documentary on Netflix.
11102000	11105000	So this is kind of like, you know, Xbox is beefing up with its own gaming documentary.
11106000	11107000	So I think that's cool.
11108000	11109000	Do you like documentaries?
11110000	11111000	I do. I actually watch quite a number of them.
11112000	11118000	In fact, yesterday I watched a whole series about the medieval attitude towards marriage, birth, and death.
11119000	11124000	And with the change of the Anglican Reformation.
11125000	11129000	Would they call that Romney documentary The Biggest Loser?
11130000	11131000	Oh, stop. It's just called-
11131000	11134000	Redertainment said we didn't find shit, the documentary where we don't find shit.
11135000	11137000	You probably will find some shit, but not the shit you're looking for.
11138000	11139000	It would be like when Geraldo opened that tomb.
11140000	11141000	I was just thinking that.
11142000	11143000	I was just thinking that.
11144000	11145000	Look, nothing.
11146000	11147000	Yeah.
11148000	11149000	So, oh well.
11150000	11151000	Alright.
11152000	11154000	It's going to be a big bomb and everyone's going to be like, yay bomb.
11155000	11158000	Uh, that is, that is it for the news.
11158000	11166000	We are about to go to the Skype line, but since I do have to free up the Skype line for the night, this is the part of the show where we're going to say goodbye to Loki.
11167000	11169000	Loki, thanks for being here on the show tonight.
11170000	11171000	Not a problem.
11172000	11175000	Do you have any final, well first I should ask, do you have any quick last minute stories for our listeners?
11176000	11178000	Just one small one. It's Grand Theft Auto 5 related.
11179000	11183000	There's going to be, actually it was kind of leaked out that there's going to be some Christmas DLC.
11183000	11196000	They've already started patching it in and if you happen to be playing Grand Theft Auto online, if you look up at the sky, you'll notice that some light snow is falling and pretty soon that light snow is going to turn into heavy snow as we get towards Christmas.
11197000	11207000	So, full snow in Los Santos and there's going to be some like Santa costume thing that you can get for your characters.
11208000	11209000	Alright.
11209000	11216000	Loki, thanks for being on the show tonight. Have a wonderful holiday. Have fun with Christmas with Josh and Nellie and all that.
11217000	11219000	And do you have any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?
11220000	11223000	No, not really. Just have a good holiday everyone.
11224000	11228000	Alright, well thanks for being here tonight Loki and take care of yourself and best of luck.
11229000	11230000	And rub your wife's feet.
11231000	11232000	Yes, rub your wife's feet.
11233000	11235000	Alright, bye Nellie. Bye you guys, take care.
11236000	11237000	Bye.
11237000	11241000	Loki, I don't know if he'll pop in chat. He might show up in chat a little later in the show. We'll see.
11242000	11243000	I thought he was already in chat.
11244000	11246000	Alright, but in the meantime, Jamie's going to answer this call.
11247000	11248000	I am?
11249000	11251000	Yes, because Alan just brought dinner. I want dinner. So, sorry about it.
11252000	11254000	Hey, this is OLR. What's up?
11255000	11256000	Hey, this is Act Theft.
11257000	11261000	Hi, Act Theft. Thank you for visiting my village. I'm glad you still love Animal Crossing.
11261000	11272000	Well, I still play it on occasion. Not as much as I did a few months ago, but I may pick it up again to do the rest of the stuff I haven't done.
11273000	11275000	I brought Dan into making a tent in my village.
11276000	11283000	Yeah, I saw it. I saw the tent and I left Dan a present too. Well, a letter and a present.
11284000	11285000	So, what's up tonight?
11285000	11302000	Well, a little follow-up to the email Ross Tillyute sent. Basically, there's a lot of sites that sell or do bundles, sells games for sheep.
11303000	11320000	DRM, Steam activated and all that stuff. There was a few mentioned in chat, like Indie Royale that sell bundles for games that are recently developed or recently released.
11321000	11329000	They're pretty cool games and they're activated on Steam and they have also Viscera activated games and DRM free.
11329000	11340000	There's also another page I mentioned in chat earlier, Indie Gala, that also sells DRM free games.
11341000	11354000	I think right now they have Euro Truck Simulator 2, DRM free and Steam activated for pretty cheap. I think less than $5.
11355000	11358000	That's pretty cool. Do you also mind putting links in the chat room too?
11359000	11360000	Yeah, I will.
11361000	11365000	Let me ask you, I'm back. Hi, I'm eating but I'm going to pop in with questions once in a while.
11366000	11372000	Let me ask you this question Actif, since you seem pretty prolific on the sales that are going on and you're a thrifty gamer, let's say.
11373000	11379000	Kind of going back to that email that came in, why do you think everybody's up Steam's ass?
11383000	11384000	How so?
11384000	11391000	Why is it that gaming websites in general tend to focus more on Steam than anything else?
11392000	11401000	Basically because it's the most popular. It's really popular out there and there's millions maybe that use Steam.
11402000	11408000	And even that's pretty much the start of it all. So it's basically popularity.
11408000	11414000	There are many sites that cover deals and stuff that we all know cheap as gamers.
11415000	11426000	Well I hold their Twitter feed and they post about deals and stuff from a lot of places, not only Steam.
11427000	11434000	Like Amazon, Green Man Gaming that sells a pretty good site for deals, even cheaper than Steam and Amazon.
11435000	11441000	I got the Brave New World expansion for Civilization V for cheaper than Steam has it.
11442000	11446000	So it's a pretty great site too and they also sell DRM-free stuff.
11449000	11460000	But basically it's all popularity and really since all the games that are sold on all those sites activate in Steam.
11460000	11465000	So basically it's like you already have it, so why not?
11466000	11474000	Fair enough. I think also all the extra stuff Steam has to do, building the achievements and the friend talks, that's kind of smart too.
11475000	11483000	I mean I realize like Tesura has some of that and some of the other competitors, but I think that goes a long way too in making Steam a little more than just a store.
11483000	11494000	Not that I'm, you know, I understand that we should kind of tip a hat to everybody that's got a really great sale going on, although I don't think we could ever possibly cover every great sale in gaming.
11495000	11497000	But I think it is why people tend to focus on Steam.
11498000	11500000	So anyway, Act F before we let you go, any other thoughts?
11501000	11512000	There's another site that I recently discovered that's called Groopies. G-R-O-U-P-E-E-S dot com.
11513000	11520000	That also sells not only games, they also sell music and they have pretty good, great bundles.
11521000	11522000	Correct me if I'm wrong.
11523000	11527000	Didn't they also host the Magfest donation slash award drive?
11527000	11533000	Yeah, they did the Magfest bundle and I bought that. It's a pretty great bundle.
11534000	11543000	Yeah, I mean it's always a great time, you know, every day is a good day for consumers because there's always so many new, fantastic things.
11544000	11551000	And some of them specialize in ways that may align with your interests more, so seek them out and support them.
11552000	11553000	Indeed.
11554000	11557000	Alright Act F, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call.
11558000	11559000	Thank you. Have a nice.
11560000	11561000	Alright, take care. Happy Holidays. Bye.
11562000	11566000	1877 Game O-L-R, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11567000	11570000	I'm going to try to pull up the Twitter here real quick while I'm in between bites of my dinner.
11571000	11572000	Oh, but we do have another call coming in.
11573000	11574000	So Jason, you ready to answer this one?
11575000	11577000	Alright, you ready? You fill that host role.
11578000	11582000	Alright, here we go, another call on the line while I chow down on some sweet and sour chicken over here.
11583000	11586000	Also, hello caller. What's your name? Who are you calling from? Where are you calling from?
11587000	11588000	It's Ron from Brooklyn, man. What's up?
11589000	11590000	Ronchon!
11591000	11592000	I sent you a card.
11593000	11594000	You got what?
11595000	11596000	I sent you a card.
11597000	11599000	Awesome. You'll be getting your gift tomorrow.
11602000	11606000	Appropriate for the Christmas spirit. The holiday spirit. The non-dominational spirit.
11607000	11610000	Denominational. Denominational as well. Words are hard.
11611000	11612000	Some people like to be dominated.
11613000	11614000	Let's see, um...
11615000	11616000	Robby, can you tell us something?
11617000	11618000	What's up, Ramna?
11619000	11622000	Okay. Couple of things I want to cover. I'm getting the hell up on out of here.
11623000	11627000	Now, the whole packs diversity lounge thing, I'm not happy with.
11628000	11634000	This does not come as any bit of a surprise, but what's your take on it in addition to what we covered previously?
11635000	11639000	Oh, someone that's gone to cons for years and also staffs conventions as well.
11639000	11648000	This whole diversity lounge thing, I just feel it's not the responsibility of the convention to have these lounges set up.
11649000	11655000	If this should be done, let somebody else come in and handle it. Let the con have someone to monitor.
11656000	11660000	And that's just it. They shouldn't be, like, dictating how things should go.
11661000	11665000	Because I just see nothing but bad juju coming out of this.
11665000	11670000	Especially considering the source of the drama is the con organizers themselves.
11671000	11676000	Yeah, I personally, I give them more or less a pass, because I'm very understanding about various things.
11677000	11682000	Some people feel that I shouldn't, but it's my thought train, it's my logic, that, you know.
11683000	11691000	But you are of the opinion that this is something that should exist, just executed slightly differently?
11692000	11697000	Yeah, because I don't know if you noticed, there's been a lot of crazy shit going on with conventions.
11698000	11704000	I mean, there was one con where a girl was sexually assaulted and the convention just dropped the entire ball about that.
11705000	11708000	Oh, they sucked. I read that and was so pissed off.
11709000	11713000	Yes, and there are con staffers I speak to that run other conventions.
11713000	11721000	About a third of them say that the con's not at fault here, and that really started a shitstorm, but that's for another time.
11722000	11725000	And this isn't even just a convention thing in the strictest sense.
11726000	11732000	Obviously that's where the biggest news and availability comes out, because this is a massive group of people,
11733000	11740000	and things of this nature can, unfortunately, get caught in the, not even the noise, but also the news,
11740000	11744000	and that these little things have to really, you know, like, bubble up to become a big deal.
11745000	11751000	Is this something... I've never been to a con that has something like that.
11752000	11753000	Neither have I.
11754000	11758000	But has there ever been a fixed presence in any con you've been to to address these issues?
11759000	11765000	Not at all. The closest I've been to a convention where we had something like this was Otacon years ago.
11765000	11769000	We have what was called the black cosplayers social thread.
11770000	11775000	The point of this was for a bunch of black cosplayers to get together and hang out and say, we don't see each other.
11776000	11782000	But we kept saying, it's for everyone to join, but it's just for us to get together and hang out, you know, because we don't see each other.
11783000	11789000	That was going good for a couple of years, so somebody got offended and started the Asian social thread,
11789000	11798000	and Mexican this, this, and that, until someone came along and started the Aryan Nation social thread, and it shut everything down.
11800000	11811000	I'm kind of surprised that you went, that there was another list of minorities, although I obviously get a fair amount of the reference in that last group that you just mentioned.
11812000	11816000	Yeah, it was supposed to be a joke to prove that everybody was being ridiculous about it.
11816000	11822000	It was more like just to get together and have a good time. This was something that we were planning more or less.
11823000	11830000	Now, if the con itself had gotten involved, it probably would have gotten a hell of a lot worse before all this even happened.
11831000	11834000	Yours had a theme, but not an exclusion, not a restriction.
11835000	11843000	Right. Now, the whole diversity, I see the similarities, but I just see still it's going to cause a problem.
11843000	11860000	It's like I said on a friend's Facebook. They're diversifying everything. That means, us folk, we're going to be at the back of the convention center on dial-up, while everybody else is going to be at the front of the convention center on shitty Wi-Fi.
11860000	11882000	Despite the difference in mediums, still makes a pretty significant difference. And yeah, as we said, it's only creating a prejudice zone, because whatever people feel that they'll be there, it will only be these individuals there in the first place in large part.
11883000	11885000	Anything else on your mind?
11885000	11898000	A couple more things. I want to agree with Doc Sacher about the whole DDR and exercise thing, because I did that for a while. DDR four times a day, took vitamins, I ended up dropping like 20 pounds, so I dislocated my knee.
11899000	11925000	Yeah. Well, the first DDR that Dan ever bought me, the first one I physically owned that wasn't a burn, was Second Mix on Dreamcast. And over that summer, since my birthday in April, I dropped something like 10 to 15 pounds, and I had had some torn tendons in my foot from college in Alabama, and completely healed my foot.
11926000	11939000	Gotcha. So, I mean, there is such a thing as overdoing and pushing yourself a bit too hard. I think with any exercise, one needs to be careful. Clearly, as it was in your case, too.
11940000	11950000	Well, I dislocated my knee for other reasons, but... So, DDR is safe. Yeah, yeah. I banged my head on the monitor once. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to overstep you.
11950000	11952000	I'm sorry. Go ahead, you.
11953000	11959000	Okay. When I got out of the hospital, my first thought was, well, fuck, can I play DDR again? That was my first thing that came to mind.
11960000	11970000	Yep. There was one time, and Rob, I think you were there, when I got dizzy playing at the time I was on sevens, and I slipped forward and hit my head on the machine.
11971000	11972000	I think I was there.
11973000	11974000	And then I got up and finished it.
11975000	11976000	That was scary, though.
11976000	11985000	There was this big red welt on my forehead. That was pretty fun, though. I mean, I can look back at it and laugh now, and I wasn't scared because I was focused on playing, but everyone else was like, oh my god.
11986000	11993000	Yeah, scary. Alright, well, Rama, we're gonna let you go so we can probably take one more call and then wrap up for the night, but thanks for calling.
11993000	12004000	Alright, before I go, I'm just gonna say this. For allowing Anime Jam Session on VOG, for helping us out, and all the good stuff, I have here a shot of sake.
12005000	12010000	I just want to say, on behalf of Anime Jam Session, the OLR, thanks for everything, happy holidays, and happy new year.
12011000	12018000	Well, we've got a glass of water, Jason has a Pepsi Wild Cherry, and Dark Sakura has her iPhone, and we're toasting right now. There you go.
12019000	12022000	And I'm gonna send Jamie a picture of the sake that I took a shot out of.
12023000	12024000	Alright, take care, buddy. Have a good one.
12025000	12026000	You too. Alright, bye.
12027000	12030000	Well, I am done shoving Chinese food down my throat. It was really good, just saying.
12031000	12033000	It smelled good. I'm sorry. I feel so rude eating it.
12034000	12038000	You offered any of this. Well, no, you offered, and I said no, and then I realized all I had today was a salad and some cheese.
12039000	12040000	You realized the mistake you made. Sorry.
12041000	12043000	It was just I couldn't see anything that wasn't sugary.
12044000	12048000	Alright, since I am done eating, I will take this last call. Hi, you're on Orange Munch Radio. Who's this?
12049000	12050000	Hey, this is Brad from Pod Culture.
12050000	12052000	Hey, this is Brad from Pod Culture. How you doing?
12053000	12054000	Ah, Pichiken, man. Pichiken.
12055000	12062000	Kitty. Long time, no talk, but I know you've still been going on VOG and a lot of great episodes lately, so...
12063000	12065000	It's not that long, dude. It's only been a few months.
12066000	12067000	Kitty. It's still a while.
12068000	12073000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dark Sakura talking about my avatar there.
12074000	12076000	Alright, settle down so Brad can get his thought out. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
12076000	12088000	Well, y'all don't talk too much about mobile games, but I had to call in and tell you about a mobile game that's kind of become crack for Christina and I here of late.
12089000	12092000	It's Doctor Who Legacy, and it's on iOS and Android.
12093000	12095000	Yeah, you told me about that. I need to find this.
12095000	12113000	It's pretty much a bejeweled clone, but they got all kinds of little unlocks and, you know, you can unlock different characters and costumes and levels and all that kind of crap, and there's just something that makes it like crack. You can't stop playing it.
12114000	12115000	It's the Doctor.
12116000	12122000	You know what's interesting, though, is that usually those Doctor Who games don't really get very good reviews. Like, weren't there someone like the DS or whatever?
12122000	12124000	Yeah, well, there was one.
12125000	12126000	There was the Top Trumps game.
12127000	12128000	Yeah, Top Trumps, and that was alright.
12129000	12130000	Someone had sent it to me.
12131000	12138000	There was one on PSN that was kind of bad, like in the eternity clock or something, I think, of what it was.
12139000	12145000	The rules weren't so great, but this one, you know, if you like Bejeweled or those kind of games and you like Doctor Who, it's perfect.
12145000	12152000	I had the Mazes of Time game somewhere, and that was kind of a neat little partner puzzle-solving game.
12153000	12156000	That one, the controls were god-awful. I couldn't stand it.
12157000	12164000	I didn't mind it that much, and someone had gifted it to me, so I really enjoyed it, but I didn't play very far at it.
12165000	12167000	Ooh, this has Clara, so I'm definitely downloading it.
12167000	12179000	Oh yeah, and right now they have an advent calendar type of thing where they release a code a day or a different level a day all throughout the holidays, and the one that came out today was for Sarah Jane.
12180000	12182000	I love Sarah Jane! She's my favorite.
12182000	12192000	Yeah, and it's neat. It's a free game, although there are of course in-app purchases where you can buy crystals and crap to level up a little faster, but you don't have to pay a cent for it.
12193000	12202000	And the developer's been really good at communication, because I've had a couple of issues where I've had to email them twice, and they've responded really fast, within hours.
12203000	12206000	Well that's cool. Yeah, well I'm actually downloading it now.
12207000	12210000	Yeah, it's a lot of fun. It's worth checking out, especially for free.
12210000	12216000	And I'm fairly addicted to Bejeweled on my phone, so maybe this will fill in my addiction.
12217000	12226000	Well, I don't mind at all talking about mobile phone games here on the show, and especially one that I kind of think would be of interest to nerds out there.
12227000	12232000	I think there's probably a lot of people out there that not only like video games, but like their Doctor Who as well.
12233000	12238000	Yeah, I just wanted to call in and mention that in case folks hadn't heard about it, and check it out. It's fun.
12238000	12242000	I do have to ask. Did you watch Day of the Doctor?
12243000	12245000	Oh yeah, I went to the theater and saw it.
12246000	12248000	Did you get the sniffles at the end?
12249000	12256000	I was a little disappointed that we didn't see the whole... you talking about with John Hurt?
12257000	12259000	No, no, no, no. I'm talking about with Curator.
12260000	12264000	Oh, that. That was a neat touch.
12264000	12268000	I had to dry my eyes. And if nobody knows what we're talking about, go watch it.
12269000	12273000	Oh, I even say better than that, Night of the Doctor.
12274000	12276000	Yeah, that was pretty good too, because I love Paul McGann.
12277000	12280000	On a scale of 1 to 10, how excited are you for the Christmas episode?
12281000	12285000	Oh, well, anything that brings me more Clara is a 10.
12286000	12288000	Anything that gets rid of Matt Smith. I mean...
12289000	12290000	Hey, Matt's awesome.
12291000	12293000	Hey, there's a reason we named the cat Clara.
12294000	12299000	I don't like Matt Smith's doctor, but I love David Tennant, but nobody tops Tom Baker.
12300000	12303000	I don't even really watch the show, but Peter Capaldi looks very interesting.
12304000	12305000	Oh, he's going to be a great doctor.
12306000	12310000	Oh yeah, he's going to be great, and the little cameo he had in the anniversary special was awesome.
12311000	12312000	Oh yeah, that was great.
12313000	12317000	Brad, before we let you go, do you want to give a quick plug for this week's Pod Culture coming up tomorrow on VOG?
12317000	12327000	Well, it's just the second half of our Case of the Missing Geek series that we did, because Christina was out of town.
12328000	12333000	We generally do something to make some kind of smart-ass connection between what's going on in the show.
12334000	12340000	But yeah, we're just talking about TV, and Glenn has his guilty pleasure movies that...
12341000	12344000	Yeah, this one's... it's bad.
12344000	12347000	Oh, I can't wait to hear it, because I love me some guilty pleasure movies.
12348000	12354000	Alright, of course, lots of great shows all about television and movies throughout the world on Mondays here at the Voice Geeks Network.
12355000	12363000	Critical Myth at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern, British Invaders at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, and Pod Culture with Brad right here at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
12364000	12366000	Brad, thanks so much for the call, and keep on gaming.
12367000	12368000	Alright, later guys.
12368000	12374000	Alright, that is going to do it for the Skype line tonight. We're running pretty long tonight, but isn't that always the case here at OLR?
12375000	12376000	We just never shut up here at OLR.
12377000	12378000	Kitty!
12379000	12380000	Alright, Kitty's gone, I'm sorry.
12381000	12382000	That's okay, I have a midnight home.
12383000	12385000	If you blow enough kisses, Sanrio might come out, we'll see. Just kidding, she hates people.
12386000	12387000	She'll run away.
12388000	12390000	She hates people, I'm sorry. Go take it personally with her.
12391000	12392000	I know, I have cats sad enough.
12393000	12397000	You should have seen her, Grandpa was over here yesterday and I brought her out to say hi. Oh, she was not happy.
12398000	12404000	No, I have a midnight home, and Little Miss has been quite the affection whore today.
12405000	12409000	Oh, I've got the picture in my email of Ranma's sake.
12410000	12411000	Oh yeah?
12412000	12414000	But you don't do shots of sake, you heat it and you sip it.
12415000	12417000	It's taking forever to load.
12418000	12426000	Alright, well I'm looking at the Twitters, and a few of the things were things that I had already talked about,
12426000	12429000	or that one of us had talked about earlier in the show with some of the news links.
12430000	12434000	I do want to mention a tweet that came in earlier this week from Red the Haze, and I have to remember,
12435000	12438000	I don't remember the context of this, but his tweet said,
12439000	12441000	Gonna have to disagree with OLR Sky Dark Sakura.
12442000	12446000	There were, are, a lot of military service members on WoW, many with clearances.
12447000	12448000	Don't worry, I still love you guys.
12449000	12450000	I saw that too.
12451000	12452000	Yeah, I can't think that we would have come out here and said,
12452000	12458000	Oh, military people don't play WoW, but maybe we had said something along the lines of, you know,
12459000	12461000	that there isn't sensitive or sensitive people or something in there,
12462000	12465000	and that is a good counterpoint that, hell yeah, there's a lot of service members that play WoW,
12466000	12470000	and a lot of MMOs. I mean, every MMO I've ever played, I meet service people in there.
12471000	12474000	I think it's a great way for them to have some fun and let off some steam,
12475000	12477000	and keep in touch with people as well.
12477000	12481000	So, thank you for reminding me to say thank you to all of our service people,
12482000	12484000	especially those that are having to spend the holidays overseas right now.
12485000	12486000	Thank you for your service.
12487000	12489000	I think there's probably several that listen to this program, so thank you all.
12490000	12493000	Let me go to a tweet from Dave Falcon, who tweeted us saying,
12494000	12500000	The Smithsonian Museum of American Art started collecting video games as pieces of art for museum display.
12501000	12503000	That's pretty cool, and he links us to a story from ABC7 News,
12504000	12505000	and I'm trying to bring it up here.
12505000	12509000	The Smithsonian American Art Museum is collecting video games for its permanent collection
12510000	12514000	as part of an ongoing commitment to study and preserve such games as an artistic medium.
12515000	12519000	Now, I thought that the Smithsonian already had a room for this.
12520000	12524000	Or maybe I'm confusing it with another museum. Maybe it's MoMA.
12525000	12526000	Maybe it could be.
12527000	12532000	I swear somebody showed me a room, and I thought it was the Smithsonian, but maybe not.
12532000	12539000	But regardless, they've acquired the 2009 game Flower, and the Halo 2600,
12540000	12544000	which was the Halo hack that was done, or actually it wasn't really a hack,
12545000	12547000	it was like a homebrew game that was done a few years ago.
12548000	12549000	It's kind of a neat little choice for inclusion,
12550000	12554000	but I think that's very cool to show a new game for an old console is pretty cool.
12555000	12556000	I like that a lot.
12557000	12560000	So yeah, hey, I think that's great to preserve that stuff as art.
12560000	12563000	I think it's just a matter of time before we have a video game hall of fame.
12564000	12566000	The Metreon tried to do something like that, but then they went kapoop.
12567000	12572000	Well, remember too, though, there was that touring gallery that was a video game art,
12573000	12574000	and I've got a couple books, actually, at home.
12575000	12578000	Darth Tetsuya says the Smithsonian had that exhibit,
12579000	12581000	so I guess this is more of a permanent installation there, so that's pretty cool.
12582000	12583000	Alright, that is going to do it, though.
12584000	12586000	We've got to wrap up the show, because we're almost to 1am on the East Coast,
12587000	12589000	so we really have to wrap up, so sorry to the tweets I didn't get to,
12590000	12593000	but if you have something for next week, please consider sending us an email, a tweet, or what have you.
12594000	12597000	Mailbag at orangesoliderator.com or twitter.com slash OLR.
12598000	12600000	But it is that time for us to go around and wrap up for the night.
12601000	12603000	Jason, thank you as always for being here throughout the month.
12604000	12605000	As always.
12606000	12607000	Glad we could have you participate with some stories tonight. Hope you had a good time.
12608000	12609000	Not the first, won't be the last.
12610000	12611000	Won't be the last, we'll see you, and it sounds like, by the way,
12612000	12614000	I don't want to give too much away, but I've been doing some texting.
12615000	12619000	The OLR show in San Francisco, it's going to happen sooner rather than later.
12620000	12621000	It's going to be one convenient Sunday for me.
12622000	12625000	Yeah, and it will be a Sunday when you're here, so we have a weekend targeted,
12626000	12628000	and I've been talking to Grandpa, so I think it's going to happen,
12629000	12630000	so I will give you guys more details next week.
12631000	12632000	I could give you guys a tour of my office while we're there.
12633000	12634000	That would be fun. I think it would have a good time.
12635000	12638000	I look really, like there's some gaming people in San Francisco I think would really love to come to the show.
12639000	12641000	I think we could really have a little party. That would be fun.
12642000	12643000	Poor Grandpa. We're going to take over his place for a night.
12644000	12646000	I probably shouldn't speculate so openly like this,
12646000	12655000	but if there's a healthy number of people, like ten people either as guests or including the hosts,
12656000	12661000	we could probably host it in my office too, because we have ways of making this happen.
12662000	12664000	We'll think of something. We'll have fun for a week.
12665000	12666000	Ideas are a babbling.
12667000	12670000	Keep in mind Loki's not going to be available that week, so we can't have too much fun without him.
12671000	12672000	We can't have too much fun without him.
12672000	12676000	There's also possibilities for bringing him on Skype and having his video on there too.
12677000	12678000	That's true.
12679000	12680000	These are not impossibilities.
12681000	12683000	We'll see. Bobby Blackwolf wants to say, can I come? Of course you can.
12684000	12685000	Of course you can.
12686000	12690000	Don't you want to try to convince Dark Sakura to come to Dragon Con and Loki to come to Dragon Con so we can have an OLR Dragon Con show?
12691000	12692000	That would be even better.
12693000	12697000	Alright, Dark Sakura. Oh wait, Jason, I've got to get your final thought. What's your final thought for the night?
12698000	12699000	Stupid cough.
12699000	12705000	My final thought is, thank you Alan for getting Chinese food. It was really good. Usually that place is kind of so-so, but tonight was really good.
12706000	12708000	You need to tell Alan about you guys' present that I got you.
12709000	12710000	I did. I ran in there during the break.
12711000	12718000	I'm hoping that Loki and Jason's presents arrive very soon, because I thought they were cool.
12720000	12721000	Your final thought tonight, miss?
12722000	12724000	I want rotisserie chicken for dinner. I'm going to go to Walmart and buy a chicken.
12725000	12726000	Yummy. Alright.
12726000	12728000	Dude, have you had the rotisserie chickens at freakin' Walmart?
12729000	12730000	Uh, not at Walmart.
12731000	12732000	They're fucking amazing.
12733000	12734000	Really? From Walmart?
12735000	12738000	Yes. Because they're the same ones that, they're almost just like the ones from Costco. So good.
12739000	12741000	I would have thought maybe like Boston Market or something, but anyway.
12742000	12747000	Alright, that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Have a great holiday, you guys. Whatever it is you celebrate.
