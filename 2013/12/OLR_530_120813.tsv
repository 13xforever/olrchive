10758	12020	I am Loki!
31889	32850	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
60831	61111	Hi.
61351	61792	How are you?
62793	63253	Educated.
63593	64234	Educated.
64314	65354	The more you know.
65615	67556	Did you read a book today?
68377	70038	No, I've been watching documentaries all week.
70058	72520	Because that's what LeVar Burton taught me growing up.
72560	72980	Take a look.
73020	73521	It's in a book.
73781	74381	Reading Rainbow.
74481	75042	Exactly.
75842	77183	I've been watching documentaries all week.
77444	77964	Oh, there you go.
78344	79325	They've been very interesting.
79926	85830	When I first got Netflix, or I should say, well, when Netflix was first out, it was only the DVDs, right?
86090	89353	So when I first got the Netflix streaming, whenever that was, it was a couple years ago, right?
89393	89573	Yeah.
91555	93898	One of the first things I did is I binged-watched documentaries.
93918	104792	I went through that phase, too, because Netflix streaming doesn't always have a lot of the current stuff, but they have a lot of the really low-budget documentaries and stuff, so it's a great thing to binge on.
104932	107795	There's actually YouTube channels now that are all documentaries.
108596	110799	And I've been watching a series called Extraordinary People.
112481	113762	I think a few years ago in the UK.
114643	117427	And they really, really, really like autistic savants.
118168	120390	But they meet people all over the world.
120410	121251	It's actually really cool.
121351	123053	And a lot of surgery ones too.
123454	125156	Like people with odd growths on their face.
126152	130936	Speaking of British, I noticed that Netflix, and this is like a paid advertisement for them.
131196	131676	We don't get paid.
131977	132857	Pay us, Netflix.
132937	134618	There's no little code we have or anything.
135059	140402	But they have a lot of BBC and British programming on there, I noticed that too, which is pretty awesome.
141587	144248	Do not insult Reading Rainbow by applying My Little Pony to it.
144368	145848	What are you looking at?
145888	146409	Our chat room?
146429	146909	That's deft.
147029	149230	At live.vognetwork.com.
149270	150890	Of course, you can join us in our chat.
151150	152071	What did Actdeft say there?
152131	153331	Oh, Reading Rainbow dash.
153811	154231	There it is.
155132	156292	Live.vognetwork.com.
156552	161834	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
162654	165315	Also joining us here in studio tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
165655	165755	Hello.
165775	166796	How are you doing, Loki?
167016	167356	Doing fine.
168076	168737	Awesome, awesome.
169217	175304	So, you know, there's a little parlor game that some of our chatters like to play, which is what food did Loki bring to the show tonight?
175724	177866	And an old favorite returns tonight.
177886	180469	I haven't seen you bring this in like six months, but what did you bring to the show tonight?
180689	181530	Triple bacon pizza.
181570	183092	Triple bacon pizza!
184533	185194	Good for the heart.
186796	187476	Low in sodium.
187797	187937	Yep.
188397	189078	All right, amazing.
189458	189999	I'll enjoy it.
190819	196140	Also joining us in the studio tonight as he has been on and off since Thanksgiving because he's spending the holidays in the area.
196240	199121	So why not give it up for VXJasonXV!
199401	206483	I'm sure everybody's very surprised to hear my voice again, but always great to be here as usual.
206603	207683	And always nice to have you.
208263	209563	We get a Jason for the holidays.
210343	211904	It's my Christmas present to everybody.
213231	215233	No, it's always great to have you.
215333	216795	The more people in the studio, the merrier.
217135	218737	You know, unfortunately, you don't get a lot.
218938	222522	It would be great if we were all in San Francisco or something where a lot of people kind of come through.
222542	225265	Yeah, make you losers drive an hour and a half to get down there to me.
225485	230410	Yeah, in Sacramento, it's a little harder to get the people up here to actually sit in studio with us.
230510	231432	But, you know...
231952	232392	DarkSakura.com
248084	251827	Yeah, isn't that hilarious how cold, I'm using my quoting fingers, how cold it is right now?
251847	252087	Yeah.
252587	255970	But it's like I tell people, you know, or like when it rains.
256010	259732	You know, DarkSakura loves to say, California, you guys don't know the rain.
259752	262654	You got to spend some time in the south where it really rains or, you know, what have you.
262674	265176	What about the rains in South Africa?
265196	266237	What about the rains in Spain?
266257	266777	The rains in South Africa?
266797	267758	It falls mainly on the plains.
267778	268378	Okay, Toto.
268398	269539	Thank you.
270280	271420	Okay.
272481	297740	for the record the weather right now is like February in Alabama well I was gonna say though one thing to keep in mind we're not built for certain things like if it were to rain here like it is in the south we'd all be underwater we'd be part of the ocean right and now all of your houses would fall over and say and with the cold you know we have we have like outdoor pipes and stuff here is very common and when it gets really houses made out of plywood yeah wrap your pipes bring your pets in because it's just not normal here so
298260	300401	I will take the earth shaking randomly under my feet any day
320481	322364	So it's 36 degrees here right now.
322604	325988	Is this when we play Guess What It Is in Colorado right now?
326549	327670	Negative 20, I'm sure.
327730	328071	Close.
328331	329172	That's what it feels like.
329252	329413	No.
329733	333338	It is currently 9 degrees and will be 1 degree before the show is over.
333358	333498	Wow.
333957	338578	WhatUpG and Chad at live.vognetwork.com says, I love the Snow Bowl games today.
339098	343699	Not that we talk a lot about sports ball here on OLR, but I got to say, I actually saw some of that game today.
343739	344319	Yes, I did.
344419	345659	I saw some footballs today.
346279	349340	And that was hardcore that they were out there playing in the snow.
349660	352801	And it's the type of thing where you can't even see the damn lines.
353321	356381	They have to project the lines out there because you can't even see them because of the damn snow.
356501	357642	They're paid employees.
357682	359562	They better play in any kind of condition.
359582	359802	Yeah.
360302	362763	Oh no, Rob, you were a band geek, so how about this?
363424	365084	Marching competition in the snow.
365925	372248	We never had the snow, but we had to do field show once in the pouring rain and so many of us slipped and fell.
372268	375570	Like, I slipped and fell in a mud thing, but you just get right back up and keep going.
375730	382853	The last marching band competition I did was in Prattville, Alabama, which, Prattville, and it was in the snow.
383834	384354	And we were all
385641	388784	And you had all the clarinet players that had the fingers cut out of their gloves.
388864	389985	Did you play clarinet?
390205	392067	No, Jamie played saxophone.
393208	393508	All right.
394088	397572	Anyhow, we could talk band geek stories all night, but it is a video gaming show.
397612	399894	So let's get back to the topic of video games at hand.
400594	401535	Tonight's kickoff topic.
401575	403717	Loki is actually going to start us off with our kickoff topic tonight.
403797	406620	It's something a lot of people on Twitter and everything's been talking about.
406960	409142	So I'm sure some of you are wondering when we were going to bring it up.
409182	409663	So here you go.
410504	417010	We're going to talk a little bit about the VGX award show thing that they had yesterday on Spike.
417210	420113	It was also streamed on Twitch and all that fun stuff.
421454	423516	Lots of interesting things coming out of that.
425078	427020	Mostly just some new trailers for things.
428421	429222	Announcements of...
430546	431826	Some things we'll get into later in the show.
452533	459517	I saw that trailer because I did not watch the VGX, and I kind of always said, I'm like, any of the good stuff will be on YouTube afterwards.
459737	460558	Oh, yeah.
461018	465901	I did see that trailer, and it was neat, but I was like, well, what's the game?
465941	473005	It looked neat how it was going from underwater to land to sky to space in just one fluid motion, and the art style was very neat.
473345	476387	So, yeah, I was kind of like, oh, this is neat, but is it a shooter?
476407	478348	Because I see bullets being counted in the corner.
479128	480229	What the heck game is it?
480819	497844	I don't know yeah that's the only thing that kind of gets me about it is I'm like alright cool story bro what's the game it just looks interesting yeah I look forward to the next chapter and what this game's like I'm not dissing the game it looked really good but I just I'm curious you know well okay what else is there
498208	510490	Well, okay, so basically the main thing about this is there's been a lot of conflicting opinions about the show since this is kind of a whole change of venue for the VGAs.
510610	519112	Now it's this new, there's no audience really, it's just kind of this studio set and they have developers on, they're interviewing them with different things.
519672	526333	To me it seemed like a very long version of their game trailer show that they normally have on Spike and
527633	538956	Except, you know, they gave out awards and they had Joel McHale and a lot of people didn't like Joel McHale because they thought he was just, you know, hating on the entire show and not taking anything seriously.
539456	544457	And which, I mean, if you're a paid presenter, I don't think that he's doing that on purpose.
544477	545898	That's just schtick, but whatever.
546758	546858	Um...
548378	573397	and you know he made some major faux pas as well that should be called out like he and to some people you may go oh it's the big deal but you know again if you're trying to break out of that whole machismo you know gaming culture and it's only for a certain type of people especially coming off last week when we had a guest that was really talking about inclusive games you know Joe McHale made a pretty off joke in the first 10 minutes of the show something about Wario getting a sex change
574137	587245	which can be construed as transphobic which you know I realize there's a fine line between are we too sensitive about getting offended easily and you know and so forth but it's just kind of the thing where it's like
589337	598809	You know, a joke like that kind of just leaves me very sourpuss face when we're all about trying to include more people in gaming culture.
599250	604096	Let's get away from gaming being just about dude bros and that sort of thing.
605177	605638	I don't know.
605758	609561	Maybe Spike TV feels some sort of allegiance to that demographic.
610241	610862	I don't know.
612183	616026	Again, I didn't watch it, but I heard about it, and I just kind of made a sour face.
616046	631038	Well, some of the things that he said were kind of ironic, I guess, because the whole thing, he's like, yeah, we're going to have lots of trailers and demos and basically stuff that you can consider one long, giant video game commercial or something.
631538	631618	And
632739	635821	I understand that's supposed to be a joke, but at the same time, that's kind of what this is.
635881	639523	It's just a big fucking commercial for these games.
639923	645306	And that's why the whole thing kind of seems like a joke in the first place, if you want to say even more of a joke than the VGAs were.
645886	648968	At least the VGAs, it was actually presented like an awards show, and...
649628	650548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
671323	686174	It's kind of like if someone had a bigger budget out there and just filmed themselves talking about what they think is the best games, even though I know they had an internet poll to nail down some of those winners and stuff.
687555	688356	I just, I don't know.
688396	689816	I can't really take it seriously.
689956	691177	Let me ask this question, then.
691237	697640	Why do we, as a gaming culture, I mean, these things only have enough clout and power as we give it.
697700	700921	Why do we continue, and I'm even accusing ourselves here.
700961	702182	Why are we even talking about it?
702702	706244	Why is gaming culture obsessed with this show?
706544	708505	Because Spike TV clearly wrote it off.
708785	710146	They'd rather air cops reruns.
710506	714868	People are more obsessed about the show because of the exclusive trailers and stuff that they show off.
714968	727373	It's basically the new stuff that we get to see that people, I don't think really a lot of people, aside from getting an affirmation that, hey, X series that I like got an award or something like that.
727433	732235	Look, I'm justified in my liking this series or something or complaining about that.
732655	739658	The general video game culture conflict between different people and opinions and stuff like that.
739978	744142	But for me, that's kind of one of the reasons I would tune in is just because of the new trailers.
744162	749548	And yeah, I know I could just watch them online, which I was going to do, but I just saw that there was a link to stream.
749628	751309	Oh, yeah, I didn't know they were streaming that online.
751329	756535	I checked out about 10 minutes of it, and thankfully saw that trailer for No Man's Sky.
756615	759337	My son was watching, too, and he's like, I want to see that trailer again.
759638	760539	I want to see that trailer again.
760599	761780	Let me get a couple comments here, Jamie.
762011	768077	Well, I was just thinking that part of me wonders how much of it is driven by sponsors.
768878	776845	If they're getting X amount of revenue dollars, then they have a continued reason to keep doing it in whatever way they want to as long as they keep getting the money in, right?
778047	778447	Of course.
778967	779248	Jason?
779788	784493	I was just going to say it's the leaving sports ball on in the background to watch the commercials effect.
785305	813992	so you think a lot of people were watching it very passively where it's like well it's a Saturday there's nothing better award shows are long and there's enough like it's it's something that you don't necessarily have to see just until you have to so you can you can glean a lot of information by having it on and having it around in lieu of doing something else but then as soon as they talk about a studio that you really enjoy or a game you're chomping at the bit to see more content of it's like okay now I'm gonna pay attention I'm gonna I'm going to give my active attention to this instead of my passive attention
814950	829903	And also the thing, you know, kind of represents, you know, a lot of people think Jeff is kind of a corporate sellout, you know, especially with the whole Doritos and, you know, Mountain Dew thing and they have him, you know, dress up like the Mountain Dew Pope and stuff or, you know, Doritos Pope and stuff.
830423	834567	Well, this is almost like an example of, you know, corporate sellout type of thing.
834787	837508	I'm going to say something that actually might surprise some people.
837848	845370	I'm going to defend him a little bit because I kind of think at his core, he is really not a sellout.
845730	852652	I actually think at his core, he really is a gamer like you and me, you know, wanting to do a job out there.
853332	856133	I think to some extent what's happened is...
857373	858694	It's either this or nothing.
859315	861056	And I think he kind of realizes that.
861536	866260	Like, in some ways, I think this was kind of a last-ditch effort to kind of save this sort of thing on Spike.
866300	867341	I mean, let's be real.
867541	869103	It wasn't on TV.
869223	873106	This thing was on its way out the door of broadcast TV or whatever.
873286	874267	However they want to spin it,
875027	877708	The reality is they showed cops reruns instead.
878729	890653	So I kind of think at his core he wants to do good things, but unfortunately there's only so much those sponsor people in the suits and the people that are so out of touch with this are willing to go.
891073	899657	So maybe that's why he was open to the idea of turning to the internet and trying to let it sort of go a new direction and so forth.
900097	901898	So I give him credit for that.
902378	905899	But unfortunately, it's kind of one of those, this was your chance and you blew it!
906199	907019	Well, here's the thing.
907199	912640	I don't think that it... Why is everyone so situated on the fact that this stuff needs to be on TV?
913241	916842	Most people nowadays, especially in the gaming community, don't watch a lot of TV.
917462	919282	It's all about internet stuff now.
919462	921003	All internet broadcast shows.
921583	926044	Hell, you have people that used to be on TV, like Adam Sessler, doing web shows now.
926764	928845	I'm sure that he could easily...
929349	929870	Thanks for watching!
947131	948272	That's what I think they need to do.
948573	952276	There is definitely a way out of it's not this or nothing.
952677	954118	There's plenty of options out there.
954439	956541	It's just they try to do it again.
957162	964749	And props to Spike for at least still considering gaming as a viable thing to have on their network because fuck, G4 just gave up on that.
964849	965030	Right.
965991	970716	Let me go to the chatroom because there's a lot of comments on this, of course, in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
971336	973058	It is the show where every gamer has a voice after all.
973459	976282	Actdeft says, again, take out Joel and it would have been fine.
977143	981147	Blackwolf says, I like what they tried to do, but they needed to do it, not try.
981527	984891	And I bet, again, that's a little bit of the battle between the suits and so forth.
985412	989797	Uh, Bobby also goes on to say, you know, Jeff has done some amazing journalism stuff.
989957	992240	Jeff's The Final Hours reporting is wonderful.
992401	994944	And I think a lot, I don't know a lot of people that would argue with that.
994964	996546	Exactly, that's why it's kind of a disappointment.
996586	998288	I mean, his game trailer show's good.
998809	1001573	You know, I have nothing, nothing bad to say about that.
1001653	1002253	It's a great show.
1003014	1008499	and it's just, it's kind of embarrassing that he's this good and yet here's this.
1008679	1012982	Here's a couple other comments that are really deep and this is really good stuff.
1013122	1017886	SSJ100Matt says, and this is in response to why do these awards even exist and so forth.
1018026	1023270	SSJ100Matt says, because we're a society that needs a winner and a loser in something.
1023671	1028995	Award shows in general give people validation that their favorite thing is better than other people's favorite thing.
1030407	1031989	Be damned if that doesn't hit the nail on the head.
1047822	1050583	Oh yeah, and it's not even just that.
1050763	1052323	Especially Western culture.
1052543	1054224	The Oscars, right?
1054324	1062386	People get obsessed with being able to call the Oscar pool or whatever at work and that whole thing.
1062466	1064067	I mean, that's just a part of culture.
1064687	1065187	Absolutely.
1065467	1066767	And especially in gaming.
1067628	1071329	Xbox One fanboys versus Sony fanboys versus Nintendo fanboys.
1071609	1073049	That absolutely goes on.
1073949	1075830	And then you've got other people who just laugh at them.
1077294	1077675	Let's see.
1077895	1079696	Also in our chat room.
1079856	1086701	I was actually going to say, but even that in and of itself is sort of a... Some people sort of get on their high horse about not being competitive.
1086922	1087542	Right, right.
1087842	1088323	Yeah, I know.
1088383	1090804	Yeah, there is... I mean, you have to have a little fun with it.
1090925	1094868	And, you know, it's... You don't want it to be the kind of thing where, oh, everybody wins an award.
1094888	1101573	Well, I'm the kind of guy that owns every console and I give everybody a fair opportunity.
1101633	1101793	Yeah.
1102993	1104414	I would like their income.
1106114	1110335	Dan and I used to be in that boat, and now we're kind of like we don't care anymore.
1111175	1116916	Yeah, seriously, if I was making an income that he's probably making on that show, I would wear a fucking Doritos Pope hat.
1117016	1118857	I don't care on TV.
1119637	1120497	I will sell out.
1120797	1123538	Akuma JP says, my milkshake is better than yours.
1124918	1125578	Could you teach me?
1125678	1126419	Would you have to charge?
1126479	1127719	I have more boys in the yard.
1131756	1132477	Thank you for that, Jason.
1133297	1134998	Another one just sprouted up.
1135198	1138779	When you're editing this week's show, be sure to crop out that little sentence.
1139460	1140380	All right.
1140440	1145002	No, I really want to read this serious comment from Scottatron because this is important, too, in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
1145022	1145602	Scottatron says,
1153726	1155167	just dumb if you ask me.
1155707	1160569	And you know, I had that criticism when I came back from GamerX.
1161329	1169592	I had a few choice words to say about one of the monologues that I saw Pandora Box give, who, you know, she kind of made a lot of those jokes too.
1169632	1175554	And I'm like, okay, Pandora, you might be at like a GLBTQI, that whole thing, quilt bag or whatever it is.
1175794	1179536	You might be at one of these types of conventions, but it's also a gaming convention.
1179816	1181516	Don't get up here and offend gamers either.
1181977	1182797	And that was something I...
1183237	1183898	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1199367	1224477	but Ranma counters with this it says if geeks can't make fun of themselves then what the fuck are we but I don't know I I think it's a little bit different when it is someone that you count on to do it appropriately yeah I agree and I don't agree like I do agree we have to be able to get offended a little bit and that's why I'm not here raging more about some of this but it's kind of like one of those things like okay the you're living in your basement shit is old it's old joke
1225318	1227579	It's kind of like these jokes we've heard before.
1227639	1232782	It's kind of like someone named Richard and someone calling him dick is like, ah, yeah, I've never heard that before.
1232862	1234924	You know, it's very sex.
1234984	1239407	Sex change joke is just like you can do better.
1239527	1240147	It's tacky.
1240187	1241108	You can do better than that.
1241168	1244490	Like, especially in this day and age, like you're smarter than that.
1245256	1251119	It's like, if you're going to go for the insulting jokes to be fun, to be funny, go from the Lampanelli page.
1251199	1254941	But don't, you know, don't think that you're actually being funny.
1255482	1258363	Go look at South Park, because I think that shit's really funny.
1258503	1261465	But granted, they offend everybody, and it's just... Anyway.
1262065	1264546	That show has gotten incredibly stupid.
1264566	1267468	I don't know, the last few episodes were pretty good.
1267948	1268709	Alright, um...
1269469	1270751	Anyhow, so whatever.
1270791	1274436	I mean, again, I'm not like, oh my god, I'm so mad about the VGX.
1274516	1276599	I'm not mad about the VGX by any means.
1277160	1278382	Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at.
1278482	1282248	I'm literally asking the question where I'm like, why is this such a big fucking deal?
1283240	1291263	Kind of disappointed that there wasn't anything like a Fallout 4 trailer, and it was just like, hey, here's a new trailer for Titanfall.
1291423	1294024	I wish there was more new game announcements.
1294084	1297326	It's just kind of like new trailers for games that we've already seen.
1297426	1309731	Keep in mind, we're at the halfway point between E3s, too, so I think there is definitely a drive out there, a call for a winter E3 type of thing, and I think the Video Game Awards or VGX or whatever.
1309791	1310131	A winter E3?
1310591	1311472	A winter E3?
1311592	1312132	A winter E3?
1312312	1315094	I probably shouldn't ask this question but it just kind of sprang to mind listening to this
1341690	1364285	collectively the four of us are we out of touch no Jason because we're gamers and this is this is this is something we talked about a little bit last week I don't think we're out of I don't think we're out of touch because again the crux of the show is where every gamer has a voice we are gamers we have voices we use them so maybe that maybe that's the wrong question to ask but I
1365325	1369026	I really wish I could remember the detail of something that I was thinking about in one of these last couple of weeks.
1369426	1377729	But basically what it boils down to is that there are obviously multiple sides to everything and there is nothing wrong with one individual's opinion against the other.
1377769	1380870	They're both right, despite the points we just made five minutes ago.
1382070	1391053	But it's kind of like we... It seems weird to me because collectively we've said the same... It feels like we've said the same thing for a month.
1391453	1393454	A big collective sigh at the future.
1394454	1394794	and so on.
1410412	1418135	How we deviated from the fact that almost all of us, if not all of us, owned every console of the last generation.
1418416	1424739	It was like, you know, we grew up with our parents and we had the one that we wanted or the one that our parents got us.
1425399	1438506	And then we grew up more and we went for more and more and then we had jobs and we had income and we invested in the entire generation and took everything in and now we're here, the door is open, we can do what we want and we'll get there, but...
1439506	1442248	Let me tell you where I think your viewpoint skewed a little bit.
1442308	1447331	Because, I mean, I get where you're going with this, but there's a couple things that caught my ear there.
1447371	1451133	And one is that it's not that the future looks bleak for gaming.
1451253	1452073	I don't believe that.
1452594	1456136	It's just none of us were ready to jump on the bandwagon right now.
1456516	1459317	There's not the games to justify that right now.
1459378	1461999	But to say the future looks bleak, not necessarily.
1462259	1464180	There's some very exciting things on the horizon.
1464901	1466682	And we continue to push things forward.
1467222	1467482	Oculus Rift
1487425	1488987	So does the future of gaming look bleak?
1489087	1489268	No.
1489348	1492551	As we get one step closer to the holodeck, the future of gaming looks awesome.
1492892	1495515	It is awesome because now we're going to get a new Lawnmower Man movie.
1495655	1499480	But do they need my money right now?
1499720	1500401	I don't think so.
1500501	1507009	And Jason, if you think back to those consoles you did have as a kid, how many of them did your family really get on launch day?
1507469	1508330	I know my family.
1508390	1509630	Yes, we had a Super Nintendo.
1509670	1510511	We had a Nintendo.
1510971	1512032	I got a PlayStation.
1512432	1514633	None of those consoles did I have in the first year.
1514993	1518295	And in some cases, I think Super Nintendo was out for like three years before I got one.
1518375	1521677	I have never owned a console on launch day.
1522179	1527125	See, when you're the big kid and you get to make the purchases, then you get to, you know, kind of make some more of those decisions.
1527225	1532211	So it's not that we don't support the next generation of gaming by not getting those consoles right away.
1532232	1532892	We just get there eventually.
1532912	1537298	I just go, the realistic is, you know, now I've got to juggle the rest of the bills and so on.
1537378	1538319	Anyway, Jamie, I know you're down there.
1538459	1547105	Here's the other thing, too, is that we have experience to back us up, where we have been there for system launches, and we have gotten things close to launch window, you know?
1547886	1551749	I mean, Dan and I waited in line for our Dreamcast.
1552369	1553750	I waited in line for a Wii.
1554631	1559274	You know, actually, Kristen and I bribed our place in line at Target with Krispy Kreme.
1560933	1565956	You know, the other systems Dan was able to get day one because he managed a GameStop, you know.
1566677	1567637	We've had the ends.
1567717	1568738	We took advantage of it.
1569218	1575122	But now it's like we have that experience of the disappointment that's come afterwards.
1575142	1577244	Well, okay, the shiny's worn off.
1577824	1580166	Dan's done with, you know, Twilight Princess.
1580186	1580906	What do we do now?
1582527	1589292	I could sit here and try to play Trauma Center on Vicodin because that was right after my surgery too.
1591794	1592234	Sorry, go ahead.
1592515	1608832	I'm just saying that a lot of the people that you see waiting in line now are people who have more done maybe game launch waits or have had people to do the wait for them, but now they're getting the experience of getting it home and then going, well, what do I do now?
1610117	1610377	They broke?
1610397	1610437	No.
1610457	1610497	No.
1634776	1637580	Actually, actually, yes.
1638040	1639782	Compilations slash history.
1640003	1640243	No.
1641204	1642246	They're all Nintendo.
1644245	1649370	Which isn't going to do the people that call me a fanboy and that whole thing any favors.
1649450	1651832	But just, I'm going to fess up.
1652513	1654174	I bought a Wii U on launch day.
1654294	1655515	I bought a Wii on launch day.
1655636	1657057	I bought a DS on launch day.
1657157	1658558	I bought a 3DS on launch day.
1659839	1661321	I didn't buy a GameCube on launch day.
1661501	1662622	No, I didn't buy that.
1663142	1669268	Of the systems I can think of that I actually did punk down the money on on launch day, they were all Nintendo.
1670028	1672751	And I'm trying to think in my head right now, like, well, why is that, Rob?
1672791	1676153	Why did you buy those systems, but yet you wouldn't do it for the PlayStation 4 and so forth?
1676514	1678315	And again, it's about the games that were out.
1678936	1684380	And Wii U had a Mario game I really wanted to play, and it had the zombie you, and you know that.
1684660	1689424	The Wii had Zelda, you know, amongst... That was the big decider for me.
1689864	1691165	And so on and so on, you know.
1691265	1694188	And 3DS and DS were a little bit different, granted, but...
1694768	1697811	They were strong enough where I bought one on launch day.
1697831	1699492	Did I buy a Vita on launch day?
1699973	1701934	I don't think I did, but I bought it really close.
1702615	1703936	So Vita was close.
1704337	1709581	Well, Dan and I, before that, because he had gotten his Saturn at launch.
1710662	1714605	And I think he, yeah, Dan got his Saturn at launch and we got our Dreamcast at launch.
1715106	1718349	And we got an import Dreamcast soon after the Japanese launch.
1719790	1722032	So we were like that with everything Sega did.
1723206	1752431	one thing I haven't brought up on the show in a while is that I kind of took a siesta during that like I wasn't like when I was in college I actually I was going through some other stuff personally so I actually wasn't as big of a gamer during that period so I kind of missed the the Dreamcast launch probably right on up to the PlayStation 2 launch I think that finally started to bring me back in the fold thanks to DDR and everything and then I got into this show which really got me back into video games again but I kind of missed a gap there so but I kind of feel like if I was gaming I would have bought a Dreamcast on launch day
1753714	1753840	No.
1755256	1758418	I have to tell you the truth, that was actually one of the most fun launches I've attended.
1758618	1759139	Yeah, I bet.
1759419	1760400	Loki, any thoughts?
1761360	1764602	We kind of strayed a little bit from the original topic, I'm sorry, but this is good stuff.
1765043	1766264	I would blame Jason for that.
1766444	1767564	My fault.
1767684	1783015	I bought, well, I didn't buy anything this generation for launch stuff otherwise, but the PlayStation, Xbox 360 wasn't quite at launch because they were sold out, and so I got one from Craigslist, and so I got that near launch.
1783175	1784156	I mean, it was pretty close.
1784696	1785196	XBOX ONE XBOX ONE
1808937	1812479	I just, like, I don't even really... I still don't really need a PlayStation 4.
1812799	1813960	Like, there's nothing upcoming.
1814280	1815041	Infamous looks good.
1815261	1816562	For me, there is, though.
1817162	1818443	And we'll get to it later in the show.
1821444	1845338	I was also going to say there's some chatter in here about different people having different systems at launch the other thing too that made system launches different for me and Dan was that when the last gen came out he was managing a GameStop so it wasn't like we had to go and wait in line he could just go to the store and pick it up it'd be behind the desk
1845919	1846579	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1869113	1869413	DarkSakura
1889947	1906682	I played some Final Fantasy 14 I thought about 8 and then I went lol no what else did I play I actually started playing Mass Effect 2 again just because I wanted more stuff to caption um
1908043	1909044	Oh yeah, Animal Crossing.
1909645	1910685	I'm still playing Zelda.
1911006	1912307	I'm taking my sweet time with it.
1913988	1917791	I think I'm five songs away from having a complete song list in Animal Crossing now.
1918291	1918491	Nice.
1918852	1921854	Yeah.
1922454	1923955	Crap, what else is it that I've played?
1924596	1927238	Oh yeah, I tried to play Bust a Move Universe again and it's just awful.
1927538	1928299	I tried to like it.
1928419	1929720	It just was not good.
1930260	1933443	It's clearly the reason it was $14 brand new.
1933963	1934804	It's just hard to see.
1935504	1940446	and then I... Yeah, I think that's about it.
1941326	1946849	I kept going back and checking the roster list for Namco High because I'm really looking forward to playing it.
1948880	1949220	All right.
1950341	1951302	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1952002	1953983	This week I played more Grand Theft Auto.
1955444	1958586	Did a little bit more online on the 360.
1958826	1962408	Got my character up to, I think, level 20, which is weird.
1962989	1972394	See, it kind of sucks that they've nerfed everything because it's taken me so much longer to get up to level 20 on the Xbox 360 than it has on PlayStation 3, where I was playing it a lot more.
1973115	1975596	And on PlayStation 3, I think I'm up to 28 or 30 or something.
1978758	1985723	So it's kind of hard to get them all high level, especially when I split my time between two different versions of the game.
1987764	1988124	Let's see.
1988304	1989165	Other things I played.
1989205	1995429	I played a little Minecraft this week just when I didn't have any internet at work and stuff.
1996470	2001113	And it's as grindy as it's been.
2002354	2003014	But there's horses.
2003795	2005816	And I haven't really done anything with the horses.
2005956	2007677	They just taunt me from outside the window.
2008878	2020480	Um, and then I did, uh, as I was, uh, kind of hyping up last week, I did get to play some of the, um, final beta tests for Just Cause 2 multiplayer.
2021360	2022280	It's fantastic.
2022940	2027721	I mean, the game is pretty old, but, um... I was gonna say, we're on Just Cause 3 at this point, aren't we?
2028061	2029342	No, they haven't put out number three yet.
2029402	2030042	Oh, I thought we were.
2030522	2035843	No, that's, uh, hopefully gonna be worked on, but... Clearly it's a series I've overlooked a bit, sorry.
2036223	2036963	Yeah, like Rent Those Autos.
2037003	2037043	Um...
2040453	2043700	I would say though, it's pretty amazing what they've done with this game.
2043740	2048811	They have a game that was a single player game and they turned it into almost like an MMO.
2048911	2050695	I mean, there are literally...
2053464	2054085	Thanks for watching!
2072918	2076459	Um, the only thing is like, I haven't played Just Cause 2 in a long time.
2076579	2083600	So, you know, the weapons are kind of limited and, you know, there's not a whole ton of vehicles, but you can like buy your own weapons in game.
2083740	2087701	You kill people and you get money and, or you can do races and get money that way.
2088421	2095263	Um, you know, you can jump to different places like teleport or you can, um, you know, join races and, um,
2096344	2096984	Thanks for watching!
2116139	2123364	So you can type in slash boost and then set it from 1.0 boost up to 20.
2123584	2126206	And so if you hit the gas and hit the boost, you can launch.
2126686	2130649	I was flying in a boat because I hit a wave or something like that.
2130669	2135412	And I went into the sky and it wasn't coming down.
2135432	2142277	But it's awesome because not only are you flying around and that stuff, but just cause you have this grappling hook.
2142417	2145399	So you can grapple onto things and planes.
2146639	2147340	Thanks for watching!
2167412	2167872	Thanks for watching!
2183464	2184104	It wasn't too bad.
2184124	2185825	It was playable and it was a lot of fun.
2185845	2190486	It definitely gave me quite a big grin playing it.
2190846	2191467	It was a lot of fun.
2192227	2201410	Since I can't kill anybody in Grand Theft Auto Online without being penalized for it, which is kind of lame, but this game, kill, kill, kill, kill, crash things into each other and
2203341	2204081	It's all sorts of chaos.
2205782	2206122	All right.
2208203	2211684	Busy, busy with you then with Just Cause Multiplayer.
2213204	2216906	Is there a faction or some way that all the VOG people can play with you?
2217506	2223308	Well, not right now because it's just a beta test, but you can create your own factions and join up and stuff like that.
2223368	2226069	So that might be something we can do later on, especially because right now,
2227289	2232953	It would be pretty hard to, like, stay together, because it's a huge map, and you kind of spawn into random locations.
2233273	2240257	You can teleport to different places, but, you know, it's very easy to lose each other in that game.
2240817	2254405	It was funny, though, there was one guy, like, I had jumped onto his boat, and he drove off, and so I stayed on his hood for a while, and then he kind of followed me around for a while, and then, like, you know, later on, I was playing through, and I passed by him, you know, parachuting and stuff, so...
2255666	2255946	I don't know.
2256866	2259227	It'll be fun once they launch it officially.
2261228	2262748	Jason, do you have something you want to share this week?
2265049	2276413	I'm sure this came up when it actually came out, but have we actually talked about the Miiverse 3DS, the DLC, for lack of a better word, for bonus games?
2277376	2279457	Not really in depth, so go for it.
2279597	2286259	It occurred to me this week when I was really drawing out my ability to play those.
2287200	2295803	Those games are insane amounts of fun, but the problem is, like StreetPass, they rely on you passing people to actually generate it.
2296763	2317635	I may have mentioned on the show sometime before that I have a router at home that takes advantage of Nintendo's remote street pass feature where somebody will... Somebody's data... Nintendo will save somebody's Mii data at a hotspot, and then when you go to that hotspot, you get their Mii data, your Mii goes in place, and so you can actually start to...
2318235	2320416	Proliferate at least a little bit more in the community.
2320476	2330482	And they're supposed to be doing something like a Starbucks, a McDonald's in Europe and a McDonald's in America at the same time will swap data across regions, that kind of stuff.
2330842	2338426	So I have a router that masquerades that and I get, you know, for Miiverse, I get 10 Miis in not even 10 minutes.
2339147	2346636	and it really makes those games shine and especially like Mii Force just how in-depth it really is.
2348759	2354447	I always forget the name of the ninja... Oh my goodness...
2356881	2358283	Monster Manor, Flower,
2375967	2377828	TigerClaw is very curious, how do you set up a router to do that?
2377888	2379690	Does it have to be a specific brand or model?
2402405	2409014	It does because you have to be able to change the router's MAC address.
2410816	2420249	The 3DS has to communicate to the internet and Nintendo themselves stores Mii data and a MAC address.
2420709	2426372	So the MAC address, there's a community, basically a homebrew community that revolves around this.
2427713	2431094	I can send you a ton of links and I will do that shortly.
2431995	2436597	I think the router I bought was like 40 bucks and there's plenty of alternatives around as well.
2437177	2443179	So, as I predicted I was going to do this week, as far as having time to sit down and game, that did not happen.
2443299	2461083	I was training a new hire this week, which means my time was split between my own daily duties as well as getting him up to speed, and then all the fun things of dinner at work and all that kind of stuff, which meant that I got back to the place that I'm staying at like 11 o'clock or midnight every single night.
2461263	2462783	But you've been working on something for a while, right?
2463003	2477367	I have, and the time that I did manage to have, and then finished off on Saturday, because everything lightened up yesterday, I actually sat down and at... I want to say it was DarkTetsuya's suggestion, but I don't recall who actually said it last week.
2477467	2486569	Somebody said in chat that it's great that we're putting this on YouTube as well, but can you take some advantage of visual content, i.e.
2486689	2487670	Classic Game of the Week?
2488070	2488970	I sat there and was like...
2490046	2492429	That's a great idea and it's totally doable.
2492749	2494291	So I took the show.
2494511	2498496	I got some of the resources from what Rob has done on the previous episode.
2499077	2502762	And I have a lot more ideas.
2502822	2504123	I just didn't have the time to do it this week.
2504143	2505124	You're just dipping your big toe in.
2505144	2507467	So it's like, okay, yay, you got the classic game.
2507507	2509530	Plus learning video editing and everything else.
2510090	2533196	so I took the video that Rob was playing in studio for Marble Madness while Jamie was talking about it and I spliced it into the video stream after the fact based off the audio that was going on it was time consuming as all hell and frustrating at times but I'm really really pleased with how it came out it's the only inner content of the video but there is more in store
2533836	2556780	all right well thank you for volunteering to take over the YouTube channel essentially it's gonna be great and you know we've gotten a little little bit of feedback on YouTube and I think people looking forward to seeing you know what we can do there and who knows you know I know I've said my piece about I don't know if talking heads during the show is the most interesting thing in the world and I've said my piece on that but who knows I might I might be swayed in 2014 you know things are a-brewin
2557040	2578543	and if we can't think of anything we can just always fill the rest of the video full of YTMD strobing throughout the whole video works for me Bobby Blackwolf our guy that's on before us here at the Voice Geeks Network he says in chat I'm a little jealous OLR gets all these people to do things for them aww Bobby
2579808	2585612	I've, if it's any consolation, it took me a decade to realize that I can contribute.
2586393	2586933	So now I am.
2587454	2587894	Well, thank you.
2588094	2588795	We appreciate it.
2589235	2589615	Really do.
2590136	2590416	All right.
2591357	2593618	Anyhow, let's talk about my gaming week.
2593678	2595800	I actually don't have a whole lot to share with my gaming week.
2597081	2598342	Oh gosh, what could I talk about?
2598382	2601304	Well, you know, I've still been playing Final Fantasy XIV like a true addict.
2601724	2602464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2630578	2631179	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2650905	2651446	DarkSakura
2666845	2668126	So I've been playing an awful lot of that.
2668526	2672389	Randomly this week, I'll talk about a random game I played this week.
2673269	2677432	So you know how there was that WB bundle that was on sale a few weeks ago and I've had the key in Steam?
2677772	2682795	So I was like, the other night, I didn't want to play MMOs because I'm like, alright, I've hit my limit on MMOs.
2682895	2686957	I need to play something else to just cleanse the palate a little bit and do something else in games.
2687417	2689499	I played Batman Arkham Asylum.
2689559	2693601	I partied like it was, what, 2009 or whenever that game came out.
2694041	2694642	But that's...
2695522	2706617	It was neat because it was the first time I played it on PC versus a console, and it runs really nice on my PC with the really crisp graphics, and I could just use an Xbox 360 controller, so it's just like playing it on console.
2707097	2710301	And it was great to go back and experience that again, and it's...
2711282	2718410	That game and Arkham City, and I haven't played the new one yet, but I know those first two at least are so well put together.
2718930	2722254	They do such justice to the Batman comics, I think.
2722874	2729061	I know not everybody may agree, but if you're more of a fan of the animated series and the comics and all that, I think those games do it so well.
2730242	2731884	Mark Hamill does a great Joker, of course.
2732444	2734226	I know he wasn't in the most recent one, but in the earlier ones.
2735106	2739869	I've watched Dan play through the other two, and they're great games.
2740069	2744272	Especially though I love all the Catwoman stuff in Arkham City.
2744292	2748074	I also have Arkham City on Steam, so I'll play that at some point.
2752737	2757820	I want to get through Arkham Asylum first, even though it might take me a little while, and you gotta tear me away from Final Fantasy XIV to do so.
2759501	2761883	And then I've just been slowly making progress in other games.
2762363	2774110	New Mario, New Zelda, I haven't been playing those as much as I was when I first got them, but I don't, I mean, there's no games left to buy at this point, so the good news is, you know, through the holidays, I'll be able to make progress on some of these games I fell behind in.
2774130	2776491	I think that's what a lot of you have planned, eh?
2776511	2777532	Alright.
2778612	2778712	Eh?
2779093	2779173	Eh?
2779193	2779233	Eh?
2779813	2780314	Don't you know.
2780354	2781275	All right.
2781355	2782036	Housekeeping.
2783317	2788464	You, of course, can friend the show at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and you can follow us on Twitter.
2788764	2789485	Don't friend our butts.
2789645	2792168	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2792208	2793971	Some people aren't going to get that joke, DarkSakura.
2794291	2796474	She's referencing an old-ass joke here on OLR.
2798135	2798916	What else was I going to say?
2799577	2800978	We are on YouTube now as well.
2801899	2803621	YouTube.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
2803661	2806243	Thank you, Jason, very much for taking the time to put that all together.
2806744	2811929	Don't bust your ass being a perfectionist on that because that's killed me so many times.
2813911	2840425	do it 99% and you're good in my defense I did because I didn't the video played essentially three and a half times and I know the second time was out of sync only this much I'm gonna fuck that up so bad Jason so don't get used to that it'll happen but we're dying for more YouTube comments on what you guys would like to see over there outside of cameras in the studio we know you all want that we'll
2841665	2841885	See.
2843606	2843966	Let's see.
2845646	2850347	As far as the schedule for the show goes, I don't see us taking any shows off between now.
2850467	2855608	I mean, the way Christmas and New Year's are this year, I think we're going to have shows right on through the new year.
2856528	2857609	Subject to change, though.
2858069	2860249	Loki will not be here next week, though, unfortunately.
2860269	2861510	At least we don't think he's going to be.
2861930	2864330	Loki, would you like to tell listeners why you're not going to be here next week?
2864470	2867691	I'm not going to be here next week because on Thursday I have to get my wisdom teeth out.
2868427	2869448	Good times.
2869748	2870148	I know.
2870248	2873831	We are dying for Loki videos on the anesthesia.
2890859	2891659	I was confused.
2892680	2895081	I was talking about my ex-boyfriend with my mother.
2895321	2897662	Like, I will never have anesthesia again after that.
2897822	2898803	What was I thinking?
2899563	2900023	I don't know.
2900183	2900823	Well, let's see.
2900883	2909007	We'll see what I talk about, but I told her that I think she should record me like, you know, David at their dentist thing.
2909027	2910187	We could just totally do that.
2910207	2912208	I think you should play Grand Theft Auto while you're on the anesthesia.
2912288	2914990	I probably will do it while I'm on the anesthesia.
2915450	2916930	Yeah.
2917151	2918251	That would be a hilarious video.
2918611	2920512	Playing Grand Theft Auto while I'm on anesthesia.
2921280	2921841	I'm asleep.
2923605	2924587	Nothing's happening.
2925589	2928515	I'm just gonna let it play and just let it sit there for 15 minutes.
2929747	2935789	No, so yeah, I'm not looking forward to that because I've never been put under and never had an IV.
2936389	2938610	All these firsts that I really don't want to have to do.
2939090	2944072	Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture here at the Voice of Geeks Network says, Wuss, get your butt to the show.
2944152	2944973	Been there, done that.
2945013	2947193	I had a hand sandwich two hours after mine were out.
2947253	2947994	No, exactly.
2948394	2949554	Hey, I'm totally with you.
2951255	2954016	I'm like ready to go back to work the next day, but my wife's like, oh.
2954136	2955338	Oh, you're not going to be able to eat anything.
2955358	2956339	You're not going to be able to go out to work.
2956359	2963528	I'm like, dude, he said I could eat something right after my jaw becomes unnumbed because they don't want you to bite through your cheek or something like that.
2963768	2965650	I just hope you don't run into the same thing that I did.
2966511	2966812	What's that?
2967492	2973159	Well, the bottom holes didn't fill up for three months and I looked like I'd been in a prize fight for the entire time.
2974013	2975934	Cool, then I'm going to totally say I'm in a price fight.
2975954	2978476	I also couldn't talk for those three months.
2979036	2981758	Because I was talking like this because I'm moving my jaw.
2982499	2985540	You know, I got to say, I think SSJ100Matt is absolutely right in the chat room.
2985561	2987322	And I believe his dad's a dentist, if I remember right.
2987362	2990043	He says, wisdom teeth recovery is different for each person.
2990123	2992045	I was able to eat fine a day or two after.
2992065	2993926	And yeah, I think it just depends on each person.
2994126	2995287	Yeah, it's only two.
2995447	2997748	Don't neglect the saline wash thing they tell you about.
2997768	2998569	That's super important.
2998809	3003871	Well, they're suturing them up, so I don't think it's going to be anything that we need to... I didn't have to do a saline wash either.
3004752	3006712	I'm not going to be able to wash anything if it's sutured up.
3007053	3007353	Okay.
3007693	3011094	I seem to remember something about you don't want to get dry socket.
3011735	3021259	No, what I had to do was this... Actually, they gave me a natural treatment to strengthen the gums, and then I didn't have to do any type of rinses or anything afterwards, but I had my wisdom teeth out.
3021279	3023420	I guess I went to the back alley, Dennis.
3023720	3025741	I had mine out, though, in the 2000s, you know.
3027324	3027965	Thanks for watching!
3045842	3046442	A meat shake!
3046582	3047743	That's not as good as you think it is.
3047763	3049843	Does your meat shake bring all the boys to the yard?
3050643	3052584	Does Jack in the Box still do the bacon milkshake?
3053044	3054925	Oh god, that wasn't very good.
3054945	3055625	That was pretty disgusting.
3055685	3057706	It just tastes like smoky vanilla.
3058106	3059126	I agree with AkumaJP.
3059266	3060346	OLR dentist edition.
3060386	3061887	We're going way too far down the dentist line.
3062247	3065868	Let's get into gaming news and what's going on in the video game world.
3065928	3067929	Even though it is the holidays, things are slowing down a little bit.
3067949	3069049	There's still some things to point out.
3069449	3069949	from the week.
3070089	3070749	Quite a bit, actually.
3070789	3071010	Loki?
3071210	3071930	Sorry, Scott.
3071970	3073430	I'm not actually going to be on Laughing Gas.
3073510	3077812	It's going to be actually... I'm pretty sure it's an IV.
3078712	3080253	That's too bad because I think it would be hilarious.
3080273	3080833	I was on both.
3081933	3083354	I don't think they're going to put me on both.
3084154	3089496	They did give me a... They needed both to knock out your soul, DarkSakura.
3089516	3090616	The whole reason...
3092097	3098742	You know what, it's true, but the whole reason is because it actually dilates your blood vessels.
3099143	3100083	They gave me something.
3100103	3101665	They couldn't get the IV in.
3101945	3105087	They gave me something to take the edge off before I go there.
3105147	3106929	I don't remember what it is, some sort of drug.
3107129	3109391	Could you take the edge off the show by doing some gaming news?
3111873	3114875	So Sony has reset some PlayStation Network passwords.
3115876	3117998	They said that there was some irregular activity.
3119085	3121886	and apparently they came out.
3122086	3123766	Try not to alarm anyone.
3124046	3136608	We routinely monitor for irregular activity and if such activity is detected, we may sometimes reset passwords of affected SCN accounts to protect consumers and their account information.
3136648	3141749	The password resets are not related to an attack nor a vulnerability in our data servers.
3142229	3146190	It is an example of an increasingly common threat of malicious online activity.
3146630	3159159	Although, I'd like to follow that up with, didn't I just read not too long ago that there was some people being affected by the same type of shit that we saw with the FIFA hacking now on the PlayStation 4?
3159740	3161561	And maybe it's something to do with that.
3162102	3165184	But maybe I'm also being too conspiracy furious.
3166437	3174719	No, and I have some serious concerns about this story because when I turned on my PlayStation 3 earlier this week, it made me reset my password.
3175419	3176860	So I'm one of the people that had to do it.
3177100	3179740	And so there was a part of me that's like, why?
3180341	3181621	Why am I being picked?
3181741	3185482	Because there shouldn't be any irregularities on my account.
3185842	3189863	I only use my PlayStation 3 and the Vita once in a great while.
3190263	3191984	Why am I having to reset my password?
3192004	3193044	Which is, you know, it's kind of...
3193664	3199273	I mean, changing your password is good and so forth, but it's like, okay, now I really have to have unique passwords for everything.
3199294	3202419	If it's in Constellation, they only hacked celebrities, okay?
3203044	3211949	Yeah, but that's my problem is that I'm like, wait a minute, does that mean I was one of those people that they saw vulnerability for from the 2 million other hack thing?
3211989	3214370	And I'm like, son of a bitch, like, am I at risk?
3214430	3216271	Like, it has me a little concerned.
3216932	3223475	So this is actually on the heels of a similar tech story about three or four weeks ago.
3224516	3227598	The chief one was the start of September with the big Adobe hack.
3228738	3239302	There were between that and then there are other miscellaneous news about... Not that Twitter and Facebook were hacked, but I saw something from them earlier this week.
3241023	3246365	LinkedIn and Adobe's password theft were like the big ones a couple months ago.
3247045	3250667	And this trend that's emerged from these really prominent companies is that
3251107	3253389	They will get that exported data.
3253829	3258092	And if your password, if your email address shows up, they'll warn you.
3258553	3266459	If your password matches the same password hash because any company in their right mind does not store plain text passwords, unfortunately some do.
3266839	3267600	These don't.
3268020	3273384	If your password matches a leaked hash, they reset your password because they force you.
3273664	3292470	you might have hit the nail on the head because I use unique passwords everywhere but you probably use the same email address but I use the same email address as PlayStation Network I had an Adobe account on there that could be it you might be right I feel a little better knowing that even with hashed passwords
3293590	3297254	I could, to the extent that I actually have this knowledge, I could delve in.
3297334	3299897	The quick overview is that... Remember, I'm a corporate trainer.
3299937	3301519	There's Adobe stuff.
3301579	3302100	There's a thing.
3302320	3306765	Why didn't they just say, hey, we saw that Adobe has been hacked.
3307045	3307846	These people have been hacked.
3308087	3308387	We ran...
3308387	3309648	I bet Codeman's an Adobe user.
3309708	3312669	I know he does stuff with video and graphic design.
3333643	3334023	That's weird.
3334183	3336845	I'm an Adobe user too, but I didn't have to reset my password.
3337045	3341347	Oh, that's because I don't... Well, I never got any... Did you use different emails though?
3341968	3344790	I don't know if I give them... And did you subscribe to their live services?
3345990	3348392	I never got anything to reset my Adobe passwords though.
3348552	3352154	Did you ever use like... The name escapes me all of a sudden.
3352194	3354095	The screencast or whatever it is that they use.
3354775	3356416	Or just any of their online services.
3356556	3357497	Acrobat Online or...
3358293	3375858	I've got the Creative Cloud because I was given the account for Creative Cloud for a year C. Allen Chatroom says Tinfoil Hat Radio I'm looking for a trend Okay, Shane Alinko says I don't use Adobe but I had to reset mine Alright, so y'all just blew a hole in my theory Do you use LinkedIn?
3377242	3378403	Oh, yeah.
3378443	3379223	Oh, yeah, I use LinkedIn.
3379263	3380103	Maybe he did, though.
3381204	3381524	No.
3382084	3384405	If Shane uses LinkedIn, then he's not on my profile.
3384505	3386186	I'd like to know why he's not my friend on LinkedIn.
3386206	3401772	I use LinkedIn with my work email, so I don't ever... There are many different sources of these things happening, and even when the extracted information and breach is released, sometimes it's not all of the information...
3403993	3416117	Again, if they just go off password hashes, which are not necessarily a perfect way of doing things, but if data doesn't match, your record doesn't show up, you don't have to change it, there is no one answer for everything.
3416177	3420318	This is the continuing saga of security exploits, vulnerabilities.
3421058	3422819	It happens, it continues on, whatever.
3422959	3425419	It happened as long as you take your precautions to stay safe.
3425699	3426580	We don't have a problem here.
3427000	3430981	Use distinct passwords, enable two-factor authentication if the service supports it,
3431801	3432422	Be safe out there.
3432642	3433583	It sucks sometimes.
3434323	3438807	And then it's awesome other times, like this show.
3438847	3439187	That's okay.
3439207	3440288	We're talking about drugs and chat.
3440848	3449795	Also, I don't want to... I want to really kind of just make sure I poke something with a sharp stick here, what Loki said about the whole FIFA hacks happening again on Sony.
3450175	3454639	I just want to make sure I call that out because that's a great concern to me.
3455139	3459442	And I seem to remember when this... My memory could be going here.
3459462	3460263	I seem to remember EA...
3461624	3462605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3486572	3488394	EA, you got some splainin' to do!
3512453	3518017	My brain has like seven companies in mind that's trying to remember the loop of the details and it's been a long time.
3518117	3519698	I think it's an explanation.
3519738	3524042	I'm not totally convinced it's the right one, especially now that we have this other thing going on here.
3524082	3533509	And I kind of need EA to be very clear here on why it's not them and some very specific about what they're doing with data and how they're keeping it safe.
3533949	3535351	I'm just saying that as a consumer.
3535491	3542998	I mean, you might be a tech person sitting there going, Rob, there's no way that... As a consumer right now, I don't trust that this isn't happening because of something on EA's side.
3544299	3552087	I mean, it's just too weird of a coincidence that it happened on Microsoft through an EA game and now it's happening through Sony on an EA game.
3554020	3554421	That's that.
3555021	3558343	Scottatron in chat says, yeah, like EA would fess up to anything.
3558843	3565508	Well, then we'll have to see how much we want to support them and give them information and money further on.
3566268	3571312	But anyhow, here's something that I'm sure a lot of you will be spending money on.
3571352	3575795	It was something that was announced during the VGX award show.
3575915	3583360	One of the few highlights out of the show, Telltale announced that they are working on a game, Tales from the Borderlands.
3583980	3605809	so of course Telltale did the speaking of video game award shows they won them all for Walking Dead last year now tons of people want to work with them so Gearbox Software one of the people is working with Telltale on this so it's a game in the Borderlands universe it will be an episodic series the storyline is defined by player choices Gearbox will be providing Borderlands assets
3606169	3610133	Telltale, however, is the ones that are designing the game.
3610233	3612975	Telltale did make new characters for this game.
3613296	3620823	They are saying they are not quite Vault Hunters, and some of the characters seen in it, possibly Handsome Jack.
3621663	3623124	Although it's more of a resemblance thing.
3623144	3624184	He was in the trailer.
3624244	3626906	Part of me kind of wonders, could it be like a prequel or something?
3627266	3631208	I think it's supposed to be during the same time as Borderlands 2 or before.
3632328	3632868	So we'll see.
3633549	3635330	That wasn't the only thing Telltale had to announce.
3635390	3640692	They announced quite a bit because they also announced that they're working on a Game of Thrones game.
3641533	3642533	Yay, Chair of Swords.
3642633	3645474	And I think, didn't we already have something?
3645534	3648876	Yeah, that came out I think last week or earlier this week.
3648956	3649897	Telltale clearly very busy.
3665787	3668770	One thing I noticed, there wasn't a lot that people have been talking about this year.
3668810	3681121	Telltale kind of didn't have a lot this year, although chat pointed out to me before the show, The Wolves Among Us or something was a game that came out this year, but that didn't get quite the chatter that some of their other releases have.
3681621	3681841	So...
3683763	3684604	DarkSakura.com
3714853	3720897	Well, you know we've had a lot of joy over a particular gaming franchise and that's Tomb Raider.
3721437	3726000	Well, the definitive edition is coming out for PS4 and Xbox One.
3727201	3733905	It's supposed to be out on January 28th in the US and in Europe on January 31st.
3734846	3736707	And it was announced on the game's Tumblr.
3736747	3738268	I'm glad to see Tumblr getting more love.
3739529	3751952	So you get all of the pre-order bonuses, the Tomb of the Lost Adventurer, and the multiplayer add-ons, eight DLC maps, six weapons, and four characters.
3751992	3759634	You also get extra Lara outfits and digital copies of the Tomb Raider The Beginning and the art book.
3760134	3761494	So lots of stuff.
3761594	3764455	Also, the final hours of Tomb Raider will be included as well.
3764835	3769681	The Xbox One version will have connect voice controls for weapon modding and menus.
3770743	3772024	And that's... I don't care.
3772205	3772305	So...
3773275	3779238	There's a part of me that wants to razz us a little bit because it's like, so we're remaking a game that just came out last year?
3779778	3786101	But then I think, all right, well, but at the same time... At least they gave you everything and didn't just move the game and have you rebuy everything.
3786121	3795305	Yeah, well, and the other thing is, too, that it's not uncommon for big games to get a Game of the Year edition that includes everything.
3795825	3802629	That's kind of what this is, but yet they turned it up for these new consoles, which I find... It's just interesting.
3802689	3810094	I haven't really seen something like this that I can think of before, you know, outside maybe Nintendo remaking some of the Wii games.
3810134	3812376	That's just not even the same thing, you know?
3812876	3814197	I like this sentence in the article.
3815155	3828486	on PS4 your controller will light up when using the torch it's cute especially I'm assuming they'll also use the backlight the eye light as well but the controller is already lit up all the time so am I using the torch all the time?
3832104	3850638	The big thing about that for me personally though is that given that I've played it on PC and just all of the graphical glory that it produced as well as being solid gameplay wise I think it'd be a nice treat for people at home to be able to play it up to that level too.
3851181	3869532	Yeah, and I gotta be honest, as much as I'm saying like, you know, oh, this is interesting, you know, I do still kind of want to, I actually really want to get it, because I thought the game was gorgeous as it was on, you know, even 360, and now they're talking about, oh, we're gonna turn up the graphics even more, and I'm kind of like, ooh, I kind of want to check that out.
3870012	3875515	For me, price, do I want to drop $60 on it again?
3875535	3879217	If you want to check it out with better graphics, play it on PC.
3879978	3880338	Ha ha ha!
3881480	3892387	To be fair, it's different to be better graphics from what they've got or they are going back and actually upping some of the assets and so forth.
3892587	3897510	This isn't just repackaging it and playing it on the new consoles.
3897530	3902814	Honestly, I think it's just putting more of the PC assets on the console.
3903054	3904795	I don't think they're going back and redoing anything.
3904835	3907156	That's not the impression I was getting, Loki.
3907176	3908097	I think there's more to it than that.
3908557	3908677	Yeah.
3908697	3912379	Especially because they talk about, like, the stuff... I know this... Alright, well, I guess we'll find out in a month and a half.
3912399	3915200	You're probably gonna go, big deal, but the stuff with the hair sounds very different.
3915580	3919622	So, like, that takes... You know, and they got these other studios to get involved, too.
3919642	3920383	So that takes work.
3920423	3921823	Wait, the stuff with her hair?
3922724	3925065	Yeah, they changed something that her hair is more...
3926543	3927123	Fluid?
3927504	3927884	Hairy.
3928084	3929165	It's more hair-like, yes.
3929185	3929485	Really?
3929805	3933768	Because I believe that was one of the PC things, if I remember correctly.
3933788	3935629	Let's take a look, shall we?
3935649	3944915	I do have to say that there was a difference in, as far as when I first loaded up the game with the lower end and then bumped it up all the way, there were a little bit few differences with hair mechanics.
3946556	3947596	Hair mechanics, remember.
3947616	3950258	It's a special thing, hair mechanics.
3950871	3960884	Yes, I would believe that would be the Tomb Raider Tress FX hair, which is an option on PC that's enhanced hair, both the physics and stuff.
3960904	3963428	Hair physics.
3963888	3965811	That, yes, would be a PC thing.
3966291	3968955	So basically they're taking the PC assets and putting them on next gen.
3969475	3971878	You know what hair physics always make me think of?
3975421	3976042	Soul Edge.
3976923	3982368	And the Tekken games when they started doing... You can see the strands of hair.
3983689	3985852	I was like, but it doesn't look like real hair.
3987193	3988835	I have to say that Lara's hair looked like hair.
3989515	3990176	It was very hairy.
3990407	3992848	Well, I just thought the game in general looked great.
3992928	4005633	So, you know, it already was starting to look, you know, like... I don't want to say it looked like next-gen, but it just looks like such a... It's a great example of what the previous-gen consoles were really capable of.
4006233	4006333	So...
4008319	4011623	And I'm fairly certain because, you know, Dan's been seeing me play the game.
4011664	4019654	I've gone back and played it, you know, tried to get a little bit further because I haven't beaten it yet, but I did play it fairly consistently and I would love to see Dan play through that.
4019674	4020375	I know he'd enjoy it.
4023419	4026001	I'm sure there are some people that missed the boat the first time around too.
4026101	4032086	I see in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Shane Alinko says, this is good for me as I didn't play the original release.
4032446	4033747	I'll definitely look into getting this.
4034588	4042835	But then there's a part of me that's like, how did you miss the original release when the game was on sale for a steal on some of the very Steam sales and so forth?
4043450	4047951	I used my Steam wallet gift and got it.
4048492	4050092	I paid three bucks extra for it.
4051573	4053273	There you go.
4054513	4055094	Let's move on.
4055574	4055974	More news.
4056034	4056294	Loki.
4057334	4057754	All right.
4059335	4059795	Let's see.
4059915	4063656	Let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One.
4063676	4068898	Remember one of the things that they kind of talked about, I think it was a few months ago, this whole...
4069878	4074481	Being able to publish using your Xbox One as a dev kit.
4075121	4078623	Actually, some people figured out how to do that, or at least get into the dev kit mode.
4078683	4080884	I've been dicking around with that.
4081725	4092871	For the actual devs, they've already listed 33 developers that are participating in their ID at Xbox program, I guess, if you want to call it that.
4093691	4101657	um including uh Behavior which I guess they did uh Wet and Naughty Bear Panic in Paradise.
4101938	4103759	Wet was a good game Naughty Bear not so much.
4104380	4116469	Bongfish uh Born Ready uh Cappy which did Super Time Force uh Concept Crytek uh Definition Six which did Spy Party um
4118270	4136685	Demerge, ShootManyRobots, Double Eleven, LittleBigPlanetVita, Double Fine, Drinkbox, Gaijin Games, the Bit.Trip series, Half Brick Studios, Fruit Ninja, Happy and Labs, Hidden Path, High Voltage Software, which did The Conduit.
4137245	4139147	Man, they haven't released anything in a long time.
4140127	4143150	Anise, you may remember them, Elite Beat Agents, anyone?
4143950	4150533	Iron Galaxy, Jackbox Games, Nicholas, which did Cave Story and VVVV.
4152014	4153755	I didn't know that same guy did both those games.
4153775	4154435	That's pretty sweet.
4155396	4162619	Ninja Bee, Other Ocean, which is the Dark Void Zero and Super Monkey Ball games on iOS.
4163259	4163880	Panic Button.
4167837	4174583	Signal Studios, Slightly Mad Studios, Team 17, Team Colorblind, The Men Who Wear Many Hats, The Odd Gentleman, Vladimir,
4182433	4208910	WayForward, Z-Boy Games, and Zen Studios If I remember correctly, Nicholas did the 3D... It's either that they published VVVVVV or that they brought it to DS or some other platform because that was Terry Cavanaugh and I'm pretty sure he self-publishes everything They might have done the ports then because I know a lot of these guys are doing ports of things And Cave Story did come out on multiple platforms as well
4210999	4220608	The other thing to kind of go along with that, though, is some of the indie publishers are running into, I guess, some of their...
4222987	4225309	Small print things in this part of this program.
4225729	4236218	For example, not only do you get, I guess, the wonderful... You get two console development kits, a Unity license, and the ability to publish your games by yourself.
4237219	4248228	Also, they ask that the games that launch same day on Xbox One and any other console platforms, they say they want launch parity rather than exclusivity.
4249169	4249329	And...
4250811	4254598	I guess one of the developers that ran into this...
4256468	4258029	Was it Vlambeer?
4258189	4259269	Yeah, Vlambeer.
4260149	4281116	They were saying that one of their games, Nuclear Throne, I guess, was supposed to... They were talking with them about bringing it to the Xbox One, and I guess they maybe wanted it to be exclusive, but somehow, because of that, they're actually going to publish it on PlayStation 4.
4281176	4282737	They said...
4285194	4310918	I guess I'll just come out on PlayStation 4 first I guess they didn't have an Xbox One version available but they wanted to publish it on that platform later on but because Microsoft is basically restricting you, you must launch your game on the Xbox One and then all the other platforms at the same time so they didn't want to hold up the other versions of the game for the
4311658	4313600	Could that be because of what happened with DuckTales?
4313700	4317222	Because DuckTales didn't come out on Xbox until way after the other versions.
4317843	4318543	I don't think it's that.
4318603	4325348	I think they just didn't want to be at a disadvantage as far as exclusive versions or something.
4325848	4326629	Maybe that's fine.
4327109	4330732	Maybe they just don't want Sony to have a window on that stuff.
4330772	4334154	Microsoft wants to have the window on Call of Duty DLC and all that bullshit.
4334194	4335115	Sure, of course.
4335415	4336916	So maybe that's what the issue is.
4338453	4349580	I think though, I don't know, maybe they can get around it by doing, you know, pulling kind of what Microsoft did with, you know, Minecraft, you know, having the Minecraft Xbox One version and then Minecraft PlayStation 4 version.
4349921	4353683	Technically, they're two different games, you know, and then they'd be able to publish it later on or something.
4354242	4358484	Black Wolf says, he wants to try to explain this here, the Xbox One wants parity.
4358864	4363126	The loophole, if you are already signed up for another platform, they don't have to wait.
4363466	4366287	So they said, quote, oh, they want parity if I sign.
4366367	4368048	Hey, Sony, want a one-month exclusive?
4368448	4369128	Quote, sure.
4369989	4372310	Okay, hey, Microsoft, we want to sign up.
4372470	4373350	Oh, okay, that's fine.
4376201	4402607	so interesting this is a great policy in theory for gamers, consumers most of all because it means that no matter what platform you've backed if your game is coming multi-console you will get it and you don't have to spoilers or any other consideration you don't have to wait on anybody else maybe in theory because Bobby just pointed out there's a way around it yeah but
4403367	4417335	As far as games that actually get released on multiple platforms at the same time, if you do not budget your time... This article basically talks that the development shop, that Vlambeer was caught off guard.
4418296	4431003	But if you do not budget your time properly or you just come across this, if you are bound to this, it's going to hurt your firm and potentially your results and potentially the game because you weren't expecting to have to put...
4432143	4443748	almost quite almost entirely literally two times the work in for one release date I love this concept but like anything else it has a trade-off that unfortunately gets to be pretty nasty pretty quick
4444815	4456184	If I were them, I would just want the least amount of restrictions possible for the developers because right now the perception is PlayStation 4 is very developer friendly.
4456844	4463970	Xbox One, I don't think they've quite gotten there yet where people are kind of recognizing as a platform that they can find their favorite indie games.
4465171	4469434	I would think they want the least amount of obstacles in between them and getting that, at least at the beginning.
4470615	4472877	Hell, change your rules later on down the line once you have
4473945	4477026	A decent catalog of indie games.
4478266	4484388	And I'm also kind of disappointed that they kind of got rid of the whole... It's kind of a two-fold thing.
4484408	4488270	I'm kind of disappointed that they got rid of the whole community games.
4488970	4492651	And the idea of, oh, I can use my Xbox One to publish my own games and stuff.
4492671	4493451	That's really cool.
4494032	4497833	But I understand that there were a lot of crappy games on that service.
4498593	4502597	At the same time, though, it still would be nice to have that ability to put your own games on there.
4502617	4508003	Maybe with some sort of peer review or something like that to filter out those massage simulators.
4508404	4509244	Clear out the chaff.
4510105	4510246	Yeah.
4518732	4519012	Xbox 360 games.
4549293	4567249	and there's people and I don't want to say that they're dumb enough to believe it but they're not educated enough on how these systems really work that they actually kind of believe it because they use the magic words that oh you're gonna you're gonna get into dev console mode on your Xbox one and it'll unlock the ability to play Xbox 360 games and
4568670	4570012	So, let's review.
4570753	4578744	The reason why Xbox 360 games are not playable on the Xbox One is because the chips inside have changed completely.
4578784	4580346	They are different manufacturers now.
4580446	4580967	Correct, Loki?
4581573	4583154	Yeah, it's a different architecture altogether.
4583394	4585556	And actually, see, that... Surprise!
4585836	4586897	That came from 4chan.
4588158	4592421	And basically, it's somewhat stumbled upon the way to get into developer mode.
4592661	4596564	And Microsoft said, hey, don't try to get into developer mode because it will break your console.
4597064	4598325	Because it's two parts.
4598685	4602088	Microsoft has to basically give you the access to this.
4602628	4607992	And then you also have to enable it on your console in order to actually switch it over to developer mode.
4608212	4610074	If you don't do it without their access...
4610754	4611674	IOS 7 makes your device waterproof!
4641624	4641964	Wait, what?
4641984	4642545	That was a thing?
4642565	4642885	No shit.
4642905	4643726	That was a thing?
4643746	4644386	I kid you not.
4644406	4645147	I didn't even hear that.
4645247	4651731	If you go to Twitter search and you type in iOS waterproof, the top tweet minus the fucking LG ad, whatever.
4652572	4658836	If you do that in Twitter search, I actually did this just to kind of make sure I wasn't crazy.
4658977	4664741	And sure enough, the very first tweet in the search results, 4chan convinced people that iOS 7 makes their iPhones waterproof.
4665061	4668323	Now they've convinced people to brick their Xbox Ones with backwards compatibility.
4668523	4668724	Hmm.
4669565	4672852	I think it's just a lesson that if something is too good to be true, it probably is.
4682355	4689419	I don't know, it's just interesting to me that there's always been smoke and mirrors, and there's a better terminology for this.
4690200	4695663	There's always been snake oil salesmen, but these are the internet snake oil salesmen.
4695683	4702527	I use common sense, but if they had the ability to play backwards, they have full backwards compatibility, they would be totally pimping that shit out.
4702947	4707369	If not trying to sell it as a DLC or something, but they would be pimping that shit out.
4707409	4709791	Hey, we have backwards compatibility, those guys don't.
4710151	4711532	Why would you lock that away?
4711992	4712852	Yeah, it's just silly.
4713433	4713693	Anyway.
4714393	4716914	Alright, let's move on to less silly things.
4717054	4718955	How about something that's a lot kinder?
4720855	4726418	Well, there's actually an article talking about the Humble Bundle and one of the charities that they've helped out.
4726438	4732060	They've actually been working to bring clean drinking water to Ethiopia, which I think...
4732680	4736883	It's definitely something positive that we need to be focusing on instead of people being assholes.
4738184	4746970	So basically, they worked with a particular charity that used 100% of the donations to bring clean water.
4747350	4755756	And so now they have 3,275 people in Ethiopia that are going to have clean water.
4756096	4759678	And the total amount came up to $121,780.
4763360	4787892	so that's pretty good news see we're not all assholes I like to hear the gamers doing good stories and plus it's kind of nice to see too we always kind of like I think a lot of us when we're buying these humble bundles and so forth we just kind of click the button and it's like oh yay some of my money's going to good pat myself on the back we don't really see it past that so I'm glad there's information out there like this to really kind of show like here is how the money is really helping you know what I mean
4788177	4802951	and I think it's good that they're being so transparent with how that money is being allocated to and giving us the option and you know it's sort of like hey you know you do something good for somebody else we'll do something good for you here have some fun
4803932	4823162	you know I've always been a big advocate of the charities like that especially you know even though I'm not too fond of Penny Arcade themselves I've been happy with Child's Play and with a lot of those charities that basically turns our love of games into almost love for other people right you know
4824844	4828186	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4828526	4834590	And I know this might be a short segment tonight, but we check in every week on what games are coming out in a video game store near you.
4834691	4835651	Starting with the US, Loki.
4836131	4840955	The only thing coming out this week is Sorcery Saga Curse of the Great Curry God on PlayStation Vita.
4841755	4850721	Actually, if I remember correctly, there's Dreamfall Adventures or Chrono... I think it's Dreamfall Adventures that's coming out on Xbox 360.
4851001	4852102	It's been delayed forever.
4852122	4853363	Maybe it's being delayed again, but...
4854123	4855064	That was supposed to be coming out.
4855765	4856746	And then guess what?
4856886	4858808	That's it for the entire year.
4859849	4860570	I figured as much.
4861482	4862022	Call of Duty Ghosts
4885482	4890524	As far as new games go, there's a new PlayStation 3 console bundle with Puppeteer that's out this week.
4890985	4897147	And Jinsei Ego 2 Next Generation and Nobunaga no Yabu Suzo comes out this week from Koei.
4897568	4902670	So that's what you can look forward to this week on December 12th as far as PlayStation 3 goes.
4902690	4903910	Let me check out 360.
4904911	4909813	The same Call of Duty Ghosts dubbed version is out there as well as Dishonored the Game of the Year Edition.
4909873	4910754	That's pretty much it for the 360.
4913235	4918258	Going to the PlayStation Vita, Hatsune Miku Project Diva gets a price reduction.
4919239	4920440	Vita's region-free, right?
4920980	4922321	This might be your time to pick it up.
4922601	4929005	So folks here in the U.S., if you want your version of Hatsune Miku for the Vita, this might be a good time to pick it up.
4929886	4934589	On the Wii U, the Balance Board USB adapter comes out this week.
4935129	4935730	and DarkSakura.
4962513	4981108	Lastly but not leastly on the Nintendo 3DS, Hometown Story, Kirameki Waku Waku Suite, Kobito no Fushigi Jigen Set comes out this week, Puzzle and Dragons Z, is that the same as the cell phone game?
4981669	4982229	I bet it is.
4982249	4982790	Yeah.
4984161	4986363	Hello Kitty to Mahou no Apron Rhythm Cooking
5003996	5004576	That's right.
5004977	5005777	You can cook.
5006778	5009360	It's Cooking Mama meets a rhythm game meets Hello Kitty.
5009460	5010160	I shit you not.
5010220	5011141	Go back to the name real quick.
5011341	5012002	I shit you not.
5012082	5014163	I want this game kind of bad, actually.
5014183	5015064	Rob, go back to the name real quick.
5015084	5015424	There you go.
5015504	5016105	No, not there.
5019427	5020047	Come on, close.
5020488	5020808	Right there.
5021368	5023870	Hello Kitty with the magic apron.
5025011	5027032	It's a rhythm cooking game starring Hello Kitty.
5027112	5027973	And a magic apron.
5028113	5029134	Why can't I have this?
5030740	5031341	I want this.
5031481	5031882	Give it to me.
5031902	5032703	You're not worthy.
5032963	5034766	Why is the 3DS not region-free?
5036068	5037950	You know it'll come out over here.
5037990	5040634	BadBatsMaru is making a steak, goddammit.
5041255	5042056	This is amazing.
5042933	5047975	YYIR would like to point out that Project Diva F is being localized and will be eventually released in North America.
5048155	5049696	Some people can't wait, YYIR.
5050636	5055759	Yeah, well, all those DDR games and 2DX games and whatnot that we have other language writing.
5055939	5057179	Telling the wrong show.
5058480	5060521	My Japanese PlayStation 2 says hello.
5061021	5061361	All right.
5061741	5063702	And soon my Japanese 3DS.
5065683	5065983	All right.
5066903	5068244	Let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.
5069290	5070851	Stick It To The Man Stick It To The Man
5092737	5093918	That's the best name ever.
5094459	5096260	I'm going to name my firstborn and stick it to the man.
5098021	5101825	Just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5102605	5105067	YYR in chat, by the way, saying you waited this long?
5105107	5106508	The game's been out over six months.
5106869	5108730	That's true because the...
5111347	5115208	That's true because the version that's coming out in Japan this week is like a best hits type of thing.
5115248	5116089	It's a price reduction.
5116589	5119790	And YYR is saying you could get the PlayStation 3 version right now.
5120170	5120610	You know what?
5120810	5124392	I do need to get that game because I said I would buy it when it comes down in price.
5124432	5125392	And I think it finally did.
5125472	5127813	So I want to get Hatsune Miku here.
5128214	5128414	All right.
5128454	5130735	Anyway, back to some news before we get to the classic game of the week.
5130815	5131035	Loki.
5131875	5139241	So, like we talked about last week with Forza 5 and their microtransactions, Gran Turismo 6 also had microtransactions.
5139801	5146426	And Sony, of course, claims that they are not required for players to advance in the game, but you might say the same about the Forza 5 ones.
5149008	5158338	Honestly, I've seen far less people complaining about these than the Forza ones, but I'm not really sure why, considering they both sound the same to me.
5158358	5159379	I guess that's how it's presented.
5160880	5167788	They're saying, as with previous installments of Gran Turismo, users are able to earn in-game credits and unlock cars by competing in races.
5168728	5178132	And if you want to buy credits, they are in increments of half a million on the PlayStation Network to speed up the process of unlocking content.
5179672	5181973	So, I don't know.
5182233	5188575	It sucks that there's microtransactions in both games, but like I said, I haven't played either one, so I don't know how they're presented.
5189436	5190736	But that still sucks.
5192637	5192917	Well...
5194881	5196122	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5223121	5229378	here's where I think people get miffed at this kind of thing because I'm sure there's a lot of you sitting at home going you know why is Loki mad this isn't a big deal
5232177	5246042	I think some of us feel like, especially some of us that really did the old school gaming and lived through the NES phase and so forth, I remember a day when you would pause the game, press up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start, and now your ship is fully decked out with everything you need to beat the game.
5246082	5248423	And some of us, that's the only way we wanted to play the game, right?
5249043	5255565	Now, if you want the fully decked out ship, you could sign on and pay $3.99 to get the special unlock key.
5255585	5256465	You know who we have to blame?
5256746	5257866	That's the problem.
5258386	5259927	You know who started this bullshit?
5259967	5260127	Hmm.
5261227	5264029	It's always the same company that starts this bullshit.
5264790	5265150	EA.
5265731	5269174	Because remember it was with, I want to say, The Godfather.
5270255	5271836	The PlayStation 2 version.
5273427	5273947	Thanks for watching!
5294215	5296376	But in the sense, yes, they are.
5296636	5304341	They are the root of all evil in the gaming industry because they came up with the concept of this Project $10 thing where they would do these online passes.
5304461	5305882	Everybody jumped on that shit.
5306482	5308683	They did this thing with, you know, hey, you know what?
5308703	5316228	We could sell shit that we give away for free on other platforms because people will buy them because they really want to do that stuff, and so let's just sell it.
5316648	5319990	And sure enough, they do it, and it's just gone downhill from there.
5320810	5322351	But they're the ones that always seem to be...
5323812	5328197	I don't know, innovating in that area, I guess, if you will.
5329678	5333262	So, yes, I am throwing shade at them because it is ridiculous.
5335705	5338568	Did Loki just say on the show that he's throwing shade?
5339929	5340650	What can I say, Rob?
5340670	5341491	You've rubbed off on me.
5346573	5347254	What's happened?
5347854	5348154	I know.
5348475	5349335	I'm embarrassed myself.
5349756	5351657	Well, you did say you had cooties before.
5351677	5352478	I guess so.
5352598	5353118	I guess so.
5353679	5353999	All right.
5354900	5358643	Okay, on a much more serious note, because this news sucks.
5358703	5360064	There's really no easy way to put it.
5361005	5366129	An actor named Danny Wells passed away this week, and he was 72 years old.
5366269	5370452	Although you might not recognize the name, you probably recognize the character.
5370552	5373455	He played Luigi on the Super Mario Bros.
5373475	5374936	Super Show when it was on in the 80s.
5376337	5388802	with Captain Lou that's right Captain Lou unfortunately he had passed away a few years ago so the brothers are reunited they have both moved on well some people though can't
5391011	5396733	They can't stand to not point out the irony that Nintendo had made this the year of Luigi and this is how it ends.
5396813	5397793	Yeah, I was thinking that too.
5397813	5403255	I mean, it's kind of one of those like, wow, that joke's kind of sick, but it is awkward.
5403475	5403975	You know what I mean?
5403995	5405636	Like, I don't know what word to put on that.
5405696	5408457	It is a little strange that this is the year of Luigi.
5408477	5409737	John Leguizamo's not dead, is he?
5410097	5410677	Never say never.
5438644	5439425	DarkSakura.com
5450709	5451930	Why aren't you playing this?
5452150	5454912	Maybe find a game where Wikipedia isn't making me log in.
5454932	5456834	I didn't know you had to log in.
5457074	5458275	Yeah, I didn't think you had to either.
5458695	5460056	So let's see if this reloads.
5460777	5468143	Okay, the classic game of the week is the second of unreleased games that I have spoken about on the show.
5468663	5470725	Although I've mentioned this one many, many times.
5471185	5472006	It's Thrill Kill!
5473419	5479881	Yeah, so it was an unpublished game from 1998 that came out on the PlayStation.
5480521	5494025	And the reason why I'm bringing this one up is the fact that it was really one of the big games that sort of people were able to get a hold of it because of the internet.
5494685	5496428	You know, someone leaked out the version.
5496728	5499613	And since then, we've had plenty of other games come out.
5500153	5504039	You know, didn't I bring up... Before I...
5506807	5518795	Space Fantasy Zone was the other game I had reviewed, but there's been other ones too, like the Crystal Dynamics Macross game, a Robotech game that never came out, but people have played it because the prototype's out online.
5519516	5530343	So Thrill Kill is one of those games, and the big thing about this one is that it was supposed to be a four-player fighting game, which I think it got turned into that Wu-Tang Clan game or something the engine did.
5531404	5536987	But this one was really a lot more of the BDSM.
5537848	5543011	It had a lot more of the fetish thing and a lot more of the crazy murder cannibalism.
5543331	5544252	It was gross.
5544432	5545433	This game was gross.
5545673	5552618	And then you had the character Judas that one of the extra characters looked like Ken and Ryu attached to the torso.
5553698	5555219	With one being upside down or the other.
5555740	5557921	And by the way, that was the single worst
5561103	5564445	ending of that game too because that was the first person I beat the game with.
5565406	5573751	So yeah, it was completed before it was cancelled and it did get leaked out and now people are able to play it on emulators, modded consoles.
5573831	5585898	We had the GameShark thing on ours so we used to use the paperclip and then after that we ended up using the GameShark to play our downloads and stuff like that.
5586568	5592391	So yeah, it was developed by Paradox Development and then later Midway Los Angeles.
5593031	5598554	And it was supposed to be published by Virgin Interactive, who was acquired by EA Pacific.
5599655	5600375	Oh, EA.
5601496	5610020	And then EA cancelled the game because they didn't want to publish a senselessly violent game that would hurt their image like they fucking needed it.
5611040	5633705	so anyway that guy just like pretended to sodomize the other guy and then kick him in the butt that's just mean oh she did it too and then she hit him with an electric prod yeah that's belladonna Jamie that's gross this game is so gross okay Rob's mom why don't you read a book
5638160	5638680	You know what?
5639461	5642023	That video that was on the internet just popped into my mind.
5642403	5647466	Read a book, read a book, read a motherfucking book.
5647946	5648347	Anyway.
5648707	5650548	Anyway.
5650868	5655531	The type of game that it is, it's a closed 3D room, and basically four players fight to the death.
5656092	5665618	It has thrill kills, which are like fatalities, and you build up a kill meter, so your bloodlust rises, and then you kill somebody, and blah, it's gross.
5666358	5671162	So basically, the plot of the story is that ten souls have gone and descended into hell.
5672262	5680388	And their hell is based off of the real world's sort of deviance, like the BDSM person.
5680468	5683470	You have Cletus, the butcher guy.
5683570	5688033	You have Dr. Faustus as one of the characters.
5690200	5719182	um I was looking in chat room now I'm thinking buy some speed stick it's not expensive anyway um yeah the chat room is starting to quote that video maybe I should have made that the cookie anyway so moving forward is basically um each of the characters is a murderer and um they are being judged and so are put into fighting so that one of them can reincarnate um they go in hopes of being reborn so yeah
5719642	5729996	The game, it was really, like the official US PlayStation magazine counted it as one of the most overrated canceled games.
5730697	5732860	And they were very correct with their quote.
5733020	5734682	It got lots of hype, but it really sucked too.
5735703	5737204	We just played this because it was hilarious.
5737605	5738525	So yeah, I was right.
5738565	5740667	It was remade into Wu-Tang Shaolin style.
5741528	5752856	And the engine was also used for a two-player X-Men Mutant Academy that was put out by Activision and its sequel and Rock'em Sock'em Robots Arena that was put out by Mattel.
5754958	5759301	And Game Informer linked this 10th on a list of the top 10 games that almost were.
5760482	5764185	It really was very bad.
5764554	5765475	Dying Fetus Dying Fetus
5787072	5787472	Fair enough.
5787492	5797901	And so while it was a festering pile of shit, because it really was, it was notable for being internet related.
5798101	5801064	Some movies are classics because they're so bad.
5801244	5802425	Like Showgirls, right?
5802665	5805788	So, you know, a classic game can still be one that...
5807301	5808982	You know, is of questionable taste.
5809002	5809543	And now I feel dirty.
5809563	5811264	Like that one, which is gross.
5811745	5812425	I feel dirty.
5812445	5813586	Well, maybe you should go read a book.
5813947	5814407	Read a book.
5814447	5815548	I'll get some Speed Stick.
5815588	5816389	It's not expensive.
5817049	5817289	All right.
5818490	5827197	That's going to do it for this first half of the show, but we have plenty more show to come, including the Fugo Question of the Week, Rapid Fire News, your emails, your phone calls, much more.
5827338	5834303	And yes, there might even, if you're all good kids, just in time for the holidays, I may have a story near the end about pornography.
5834784	5835604	So stay tuned.
5836365	5863742	And we'll get to all that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio We are live on this December the 8th of 2013 With the 530th episode of our program Alright, we've had a lot of gaming news so far But there's plenty more news to come So let's get right back into it, Loki
5866104	5867545	DUNKY KONG TROPICAL FREEZE
5885257	5899473	Yes, this was the big announcement that Nintendo had been teasing about on Twitter and everywhere else that they got on the show to share this incredibly important piece of information.
5899613	5901235	Oh, and the release date of February 21st.
5902776	5904038	What a wasted opportunity.
5906027	5933276	well if they've got nothing else to say I mean I don't even bother being there I mean seriously well I don't know like I get the whole like wanting to build hype for the game that's coming out and everything but I think and I don't know who's to really to blame for this if it's Nintendo's fault or if it's internet slash fans fault that this was hyped up like OMG they're gonna show a new Zelda they're not gonna show I don't think that they would do that but like but there were people out there that that was the expectation bar in some people's heads
5934596	5936637	It's not even that exciting of news.
5936677	5944000	I agree, it was blown up to be way bigger than what it ended up being, but I'm not sure who's really at fault for that.
5944020	5952644	This is kind of one of those bullet points that they go, during their Nintendo Directs, oh, and by the way, we have exclusive news on a new character for blah blah blah.
5952704	5954605	It was something that really didn't need to be...
5956105	5959087	You know, he didn't need to go to this show to do that.
5959307	5969033	I will say, though, that there's a part of me that does kind of see the humor in that Nintendo really hyped up that they were going to give VGX a big exclusive and then they kind of pooped on that.
5969153	5970994	Like, that is kind of funny in a way.
5972055	5973536	You have to see the humor in that, at least.
5973796	5974877	That is kind of, I mean...
5976269	5983255	I don't know, I'm sure they would have to have shared the news with them, but it kind of lets us play make-believe here for a little bit.
5983295	5992343	It would have been funny that they didn't tell them what it was, and so they're like, oh yeah, we're going to get them on the show, it's going to be incredible, and they drop the bomb, hey, and Cranky Kong's in Donkey Kong.
5993023	5993383	What? !
5994608	5995489	That's what you had?
5995949	5996609	Seriously?
5997530	6002072	Scottatron in chat says the hosts seemed pissed after this announcement, so maybe they didn't know.
6002092	6002913	They did seem kind of pissed.
6002933	6005594	They're like, oh, what about like news on a Metroid or something like that?
6005614	6012138	I heard some people on Twitter were saying that it almost came off as rude, like that they were kind of rude to Nintendo.
6012458	6014900	I mean, again, that could be through fandom lens.
6015100	6016801	I didn't watch it, but what was your impression?
6016821	6017301	Did you see that?
6017401	6019783	I saw the clip because they have this like kind of, you know...
6021423	6022724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6045663	6046123	Thanks for watching!
6068843	6070564	Seriously, it's like, who gives a shit?
6071224	6075626	I mean, it's not like it's... I don't know, it's not that big a deal.
6075646	6076586	I mean, yeah, that's cool.
6076626	6077587	It's a playable character.
6077687	6081429	All I'm saying is that Nintendo may not be the ones to really blame for that.
6081669	6084210	And if you look at it from a trolling perspective, it's great.
6084930	6085571	I understand that.
6085751	6092135	But who is this... I mean, Nintendo has to understand where their demographic is.
6092395	6095397	Who is watching an award show about video games?
6095957	6098078	Not casual people that play video games.
6098619	6101641	It's people that are fucking dedicated, hardcore into video games.
6101661	6104903	They're going to spend the time watching a video games award show.
6105563	6108545	And when you put this out there, no one gives a shit.
6108785	6109506	In fact, they just...
6110226	6115288	It further reinforces the fact that Nintendo just doesn't get what I want.
6115408	6120331	Yeah, this would have been a great time to announce... To be fair, I'm not... Announce a new Smash Bros.
6120351	6121151	character if you want to do that.
6121171	6131516	I'm not totally defending Nintendo here or whatever because this would be a great opportunity to come out and say, Virtual console games will now be playable across the internet and the camera on your Wii U, you can see your opponent.
6132216	6133817	Like, how amazing would that be?
6133937	6135758	Except that is never going to happen.
6136418	6137819	That's what frustrates people about Nintendo.
6137839	6145383	Even if you want to do something lame like announce a character or something, do it for a game that your hardcore fanbase is actually going to go after, which would be Smash Bros.
6145443	6146784	You know, announce a new Smash Bros.
6146824	6147684	character or something.
6148244	6149965	Cranky Kong is a new Smash Bros.
6150005	6150326	character.
6150646	6152447	Okay, that's a little bit more interesting now.
6152927	6154107	You know, it's just this...
6156248	6156549	Whatever.
6157249	6158590	For me, I'm not buying the game.
6158671	6160772	I don't even own the console, so it's not a big deal.
6160813	6163875	But it's just kind of like you had the opportunity.
6164236	6169681	You hyped this big thing, and then you could have just... I've been on the fence about this Donkey Kong game.
6169961	6173604	I don't really... You know, I like the Donkey Kong Country games, but I just don't... I don't know.
6173764	6176587	I just kind of feel like there'll be other stuff I want to play when this game comes out.
6177067	6180530	This didn't exactly sway me into the must-buy category.
6180590	6181251	Let's just put it that way.
6181391	6184253	Donkey Kong Country was special when it was on Super Nintendo.
6184273	6188816	Yes, and I think that's, for me, I'm going to be honest, I think that series is a little played out for me.
6188856	6196300	Yeah, now it's been there, done that, because there's nothing really advanced graphically or gameplay-wise that wasn't done.
6197301	6200463	But then again, Nintendo does platformers very well.
6200503	6202224	This new Mario game is one of the best of the year.
6202244	6206766	But this is the thing, is they're kind of saying, hey, you know, new Super Mario Bros.
6206786	6207547	sold pretty well.
6208107	6209848	Let's take the new Super Mario Bros.
6209888	6212648	gameplay and we'll inject it into yet another game.
6212948	6213889	And that's kind of what they're doing.
6213909	6217610	It's like, oh hey, four player co-op is what's going to be in this game.
6217770	6219810	I'm assuming because they have another character now.
6220610	6222471	So there's going to be four player co-op in this.
6222551	6225872	It's basically new Donkey Kong Country.
6225932	6227892	It's kind of what it seems like to me.
6228072	6229353	So much for rapid fire news.
6229993	6233534	Actdeft made the same point based off the description of the character he saw.
6233554	6235394	He made exactly the same point that I was going to.
6236135	6237175	Scrooge McCranky Kong
6238666	6239027	Kinda.
6239828	6240410	Alright, let's move on.
6240490	6242253	Anyways, Final Fantasy VIII came out on Steam.
6242955	6245439	Some people hated it, some people loved it.
6245479	6245880	It's $11.99.
6246942	6248145	Same price as Final Fantasy VII.
6249363	6250504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6273642	6274002	Thank God.
6274023	6274683	That's welcome.
6274703	6275664	That's a welcome change.
6275824	6277225	Okay, now I might buy it.
6277445	6280908	Yeah, this changes everything.
6281369	6282690	Rob, we need to let's play.
6283595	6284175	I'll think about it.
6285956	6287296	When it goes on sale.
6287836	6293198	I gotta read a real quick comment in the chat about the Nintendo thing and it's really good so I need to get this out there.
6293638	6295298	S2100 Matt says, but you know what?
6295318	6298259	Nintendo still makes bank so they don't have to announce anything.
6298639	6305921	Sadly it bothers people because Nintendo comes off like the old uncle who keeps giving their nephews the same gift every year for Christmas the past 20 years.
6306741	6307901	I like it when that gift is money.
6335074	6340776	I would love that, you know, instead of Mario, Metroid, Zelda, Kirby, I guess.
6341696	6346097	I would almost buy that argument, except for two big, big reasons.
6346717	6352899	A, the Mario games are almost, bar none, some of the best of the year every single time they come out.
6353199	6361101	And, you know, you don't hear that about a Madden game, or even about DDR, or whatever serial game you want to talk about, because that Mario 3D world is on point everywhere.
6361562	6379664	and you know if they can crank out something like that then every year then bring me it every year because that game is fucking amazing uh B Nintendo has tried some other franchises and they flopped Steel Diver have they really tried was that really an attempt they put it out as you know
6381144	6384486	a somewhat launch title for the 3DS, and then that was it.
6384526	6386227	They didn't support it any further than that.
6386447	6387447	It wasn't really a temp.
6387487	6388468	Nintendo Land?
6388708	6391589	Monita isn't exactly going to be an in-demand Smash Bros.
6391630	6392030	character.
6392370	6392970	Let's be real.
6395351	6396532	Monita's a little done.
6396612	6398533	Monita's going to get unplugged after that one.
6398593	6398893	Come on.
6399874	6400234	I don't know.
6400334	6402135	I just think that there's a lot more they could be doing.
6404055	6431515	uh Final Fantasy Realm Reborn PlayStation 4 version is going to launch April 2014 at least that's what's been announced in Japan well we found when you're going to get your system again Rob right I think it's probably most likely going to probably around the same time for North America as well so that's exciting and that was a 100% completely accurate statement by Jason YYR makes a very good point how about a new Star Fox that plays like Star Fox how about a new F-Zero developed by Nintendo
6433220	6433541	All right.
6434121	6440470	Well, here I have some Nintendo news that, you know, might I don't know, might change things a little bit.
6440510	6447339	But honestly, this one, not really, because Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams could be coming to Wii U in 2014.
6447439	6450243	Some of the new DLC for the Wii U.
6451544	6452746	Janna Sisters Twisted Dreams
6466341	6467182	So there you go.
6467622	6478328	They do say now in an interview with the studio head, Arian Gorsh, says that the Wii U version is more fun than other console versions because it was revised for a cleaner cut.
6478728	6482290	And they say the Wii U is the best console for indie releases.
6483311	6491736	That's what makes this noteworthy, if nothing else, is that, you know, even though some big studios are turning away and shunning the Wii U, some of the indies really, really love it.
6492656	6495898	Some other people that really, really love the Wii U, Time Magazine.
6495918	6517691	And usually I wouldn't note these types of things, but when it's coming from something that's a little more mainstream and not like gamer or tech focused like Time Magazine, and granted they have different sections, but Time Magazine came out with an article that said, these are 10 reasons why this holiday season you should get a Wii U and not a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One.
6518431	6544716	and this isn't really something that the media at large is really talking about because everybody's focusing on PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 1 PlayStation 4 and Xbox One like a lot of people kind of already written off Wii U but a time writer Matt Peckham came out and said you know what here's some reasons why you should choose the Wii U it boils down to this number one it has the games you want to play now number two and it'll have the games you want to play next year number three the Wii U gamepad is a
6546816	6549858	That's a little sketch.
6549918	6552419	If by portable you mean within your house, then maybe.
6552579	6556601	And I'm also scratching my head at the games you want to play next year and the games you want to play now.
6556621	6558202	Because what if those games have to be from EA?
6558382	6559683	Then you're not playing those games.
6560743	6565246	Number four, it is $300, which is $100 less than the PlayStation 4, so it's the cheapest.
6565606	6568287	Number five, there's no annual subscription fee.
6568867	6571169	Number six, it's high def enough.
6572069	6575031	Number seven, Wii U games are cheaper on balance.
6575412	6577353	I think that has to do with DLC and all that.
6577914	6581697	Number eight, Nintendo has the eShop, Sony and Microsoft have NADA.
6581777	6584699	That makes no sense to me, where he was going with that bullet point.
6585400	6587041	Yeah, I didn't get that either.
6587081	6588322	I straight up laughed at that one.
6588922	6591803	This whole article seems kind of, you know, fancy.
6591823	6605906	Well, yes, but I think there's too many people that have written off the Wii U when I think in some ways the Wii U does make a decent case where it could be the system this year and you could wait on the other systems until next year.
6605926	6608767	Because it does have more games that are available, period.
6608787	6609487	I'll tell you what.
6609887	6609987	I'll...
6611846	6622631	Since I was such a great marketing person for the PlayStation 4 last week, allow me to provide my services for the Wii U. The Wii U is a good choice for your family.
6622691	6627554	It has a lot of great family games, especially if you love the Nintendo games that you played a long time ago.
6628254	6631055	It's going to have a lot of your favorite classics and stuff, and that's what you're looking for.
6631075	6632376	This is going to be a great console for you.
6632616	6636998	Plus, the second screen controller is awesome when someone wants to watch TV or play something else or whatever.
6637378	6638859	It's great as far as that goes.
6639500	6653882	and yes it is cool that you don't have to pay for an online subscription for their online service so that's a plus and also a lot of the games are going to be cheaper usually then again also there's
6655276	6663123	I don't know, I should say a lot more family friendly options for the Wii U and what else could I possibly say?
6664864	6667727	If you like Mario and Zelda games that much, get one.
6668207	6677075	It's also the only console that's kind of focused on family gameplay and more local gameplay as well and it's also a console that's very friendly to indie games so you're going to find a lot of
6677435	6680558	The games that have the same features and kind of gameplay that you...
6702398	6708122	And then number 10, his reason is that it is more than just a game system with the whole TV and remote integration.
6708482	6716087	Again, that bullet point's a little bit shaky because, you know, Xbox One, you can do the whole watch TV in your Xbox.
6716107	6717888	I mean, it's, I don't see where...
6718368	6719910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6738368	6761967	I say your best option is probably to go PlayStation 3 and Xbox or Xbox 360 they're going to be cheaper than the Wii U there's a lot more games a lot cheaper games out there and they're going to have the games you're going to want to play this year and next year as well plus you can use it for TV and all that other stuff not knocking the Wii U as far as that goes but they just don't they have games that you know they have the Nintendo games and you're only gonna be able to find them there
6763708	6787970	and you know all right I we got to get past this buy a 3ds there you go uh the things that Nintendo has to work on according to the article just to be fair uh drop the system price again we need a new killer Zelda or Metroid or new Nintendo IP we haven't seen before almost echoing what we just said and needs more third-party games which I really don't know how they're going to get out of that that one it may take throwing money at people we'll see
6788590	6790632	Alright, one other thing I want to talk about.
6790652	6793214	Wait a second, I gotta ask here.
6793234	6795036	It says thanks Colette at the bottom there.
6795416	6802583	And then the very top, though, it's written by a guy named, you know... This particular website was tipped off from somebody else, probably.
6802643	6807447	Colette tipped off My Nintendo News about the Time article.
6808608	6809309	Oh, okay, got it.
6809369	6810570	Matt Peckman.
6811211	6814734	Okay, so that... I should have looked where... I don't know.
6815074	6816334	It just seemed very vague.
6816555	6819796	It was very thrown, extended, multiple search, yeah.
6820256	6820516	All right.
6820636	6821576	All right, moving on.
6822377	6827338	There's some news about the Typing of the Dead DLC for Typing of the Dead Overkill.
6828039	6830540	This time, now you might be thinking, Rob, didn't you talk about this last week?
6830580	6832740	But no, this is different because this one is free.
6833181	6835281	Free DLC as opposed to having to pay for it.
6835601	6842104	So this DLC will turn the game's phrases into lines of commentary from Football Manager.
6843044	6844726	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6863604	6864464	I have some stuff.
6866185	6876951	First of all, for fans of the Ys series, there is a fan translation for Ys V that never came out in the US.
6877111	6879692	It came out in 1995 on the Super Famicom.
6880132	6890678	And instead of the type of combat that the earlier Ys games had, it was a lot more Zelda-like, for lack of a better description.
6892200	6902875	and since basically and if I do remember correctly I think it's the same group that did Ys IV Dawn of Ys so if you want it go get it also Ultra Street Fighter IV is
6906943	6907724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6926676	6954786	so you can get the full bundle however for $40 and I watched the location testing for it some pretty neat stuff Poison actually is pretty badass and then for video games live Akira Yamaoka is going to be at the Dubai show on December 13th so if you're there, film it and send it to me
6956496	6959318	and stalk him for me because, yeah.
6959758	6961319	I mean, no, no, no.
6963100	6963460	All right.
6964761	6966962	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6968082	6968283	What?
6969363	6976447	He, Yamaoka, did the soundtrack or some aspect thereof to Bioshock?
6979056	6979917	I'm confused about this.
6980157	6984081	I think that's just some of the other stuff that they're playing.
6984141	6985903	That his spin on it could be.
6986223	6986504	Maybe.
6986604	6987024	Could be.
6987164	6991188	It's either his spin on it or it's just something that Video Games Live plays the music from that stuff.
6991208	6993030	I was very confused for a moment to continue.
6993050	6994291	I think it's Video Games Live.
6995132	6995332	Yeah.
6996113	6998816	Alright, let's get into the Fugle question of the week.
6998836	7001839	You take Facebook, you take Google, you smash it together, you get Fugle.
7010595	7011536	and DarkSakura.
7030166	7035010	We thought we'd ask a question about 80s and 90s television shows based on video games and gaming culture.
7035050	7036391	You guys have your favorites, I'm sure.
7036792	7038453	Did you watch any of them growing up?
7038573	7039554	What were your favorites?
7039634	7041816	Do you have any memories you want to share about those games?
7042216	7042997	So let's get to it.
7043017	7045279	Just a couple answers here over on Google+.
7047599	7050680	Redertainment says, Wait, I thought John Leguizamo died.
7050880	7055602	I remember John from my first hangover when I watched Land of the Dead because it was on TNT and I didn't want to move.
7055982	7057682	That was a nice way to spend a Tuesday afternoon.
7058283	7060203	Somebody else from Land of the Dead died, though.
7060443	7063244	There was rumors about him a few years ago, but it's not true.
7064425	7067986	Just like the kid from The Wonder Years is not Marilyn Manson.
7068366	7070907	And what other big rumors are out there?
7070927	7071207	Anyway.
7073188	7077869	Actdeft replied on Google+, and says, As many will probably say, I watched the Super Mario Bros.
7077909	7082931	Super Show, though I always waited anxiously every Friday for the Legend of Zelda episode.
7083271	7088073	It was cheesy as hell, but it was the 80s, so excuse me, princess.
7088633	7094015	But my favorite video game show or cartoon from back in the 90s is probably Sonic the Hedgehog or Sonic Saturday AM.
7094395	7096316	That series was freaking awesome.
7097816	7121906	I also lived for Zelda Fridays myself that was like if I were to answer this question Zelda Fridays were where it was at that and somebody had said it here on Facebook I'll read this answer from Degenerate Johnny this is my other answer if I could name one video game show from my childhood it would be Starrcade it was an 80s game show pun intended that challenged the skills and video game knowledge of gamers which was a real treat to watch
7122866	7132132	Back in the good old days of G4, the network re-aired old episodes of Starcade, which brought back fond memories I felt when I first saw the show.
7133113	7134573	That would also be my other answer.
7135054	7136074	I loved game shows.
7136134	7137435	I lived for game shows growing up.
7137535	7143719	I watched Game Show Network when I could, when it was early available, or USA used to show a bunch of old game shows too, I remember that.
7144179	7147782	And so, yeah, I loved that show.
7148122	7149022	And honestly...
7150263	7159887	If I could do anything in my little broadcasting career, getting to host a remake of Starcade would be my ultimate dream in life.
7160007	7163609	But I know that that's going to be a little bit difficult to do.
7163729	7167631	But if you ask me, what do you really want to do more than anything?
7167751	7174294	I would love to host a resurgence of that show, Starcade, because that show was awesome.
7175294	7179318	Unfortunately, with arcades kind of on their way out, I don't know.
7179358	7181800	It would have to be focused on retro games or something.
7181880	7185283	Maybe with the King of Kong and how well that does and all that.
7186604	7186884	Anyway.
7188085	7188526	Barcade.
7189106	7189626	Yeah, you never know.
7189687	7190167	Or a barcade.
7190972	7198980	let's see some other answers here KJ says very fond memories of GameProTV Captain and the Game Master Super Mario Bros.
7199020	7209410	Super Show and the short-lived Legend of Zelda cartoon although I used to yell at my TV when those kids were playing video game challenges on Nick Arcade mainly because those kids couldn't play Neo Geo games to save their lives
7210510	7212231	or any other system for that matter.
7235805	7236265	Why not?
7236866	7237246	It does.
7237386	7237706	It does.
7238927	7239347	Let's see.
7240447	7248931	Fifth Dream says, I like the crap out of the Qbert cartoon when I was a kid and I still get the theme song from the Pole Position cartoon stuck in my head now and then.
7249371	7253893	I also liked a Dragon Quest anime called Dragon Warrior that I recorded every week on VHS.
7254513	7254973	You know what?
7255454	7257715	I actually just mentioned Qbert in the chat room.
7257895	7258095	Yeah.
7258155	7262937	Because I used to watch that too because it was sort of like they're on another planet but they're based off of 50s American culture.
7264165	7264825	and Pac-Man.
7265505	7276289	Jonko, one of our friends from Koopa Club replied and said I used to watch Captain N every morning before school and then when I came home I'd run around with my NES controller wrapped around my waist like a belt brandishing my zapper.
7276429	7279550	I convinced myself that I was going to be Captain N when I grew up.
7280270	7283511	20 years later I made it happen through the magic of cosplay.
7284031	7284231	Awesome.
7284251	7289872	And by the way I just want to point out Jonko's little icon right now his little user picture is Captain N cosplay.
7290293	7290973	So props to you.
7292333	7310985	one more answer here from Ragenator who said yeah I watch stuff like Captain N, Super My Brother Super Show and it's ilk back in the late 80s and early 90s even then I thought that the quality of shows were kind of crappy but considered the overall lack of any real meaningful choices of gaming related programming I felt resigned to picking the less crappy of the crappy
7311605	7313305	Those are some of the answers from Facebook.
7313325	7317826	If you want to see the rest, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7318406	7319827	Any other shows that y'all want to bring up?
7319907	7321547	I think the chatter's hit on mine.
7321807	7322967	Well, there was the Pac-Man one.
7323167	7323987	Yeah.
7324447	7327348	Even the Christmas special, which I actually went back and watched.
7328228	7328708	It was horrible.
7330229	7335630	I watched Captain N. I hated how the characters were characterized, but I loved seeing the different worlds that they'd go to.
7335950	7337150	I thought the Game Boy was stupid.
7338110	7364467	and while it isn't a video game one it's definitely one of those 80s things that had to do with the whole pop music thing was I actually liked kid video do you remember that I do I do and there was another there was another game show where at the end if they did well they would run through and grab like all the video games they could with the velcro vest yes yes what somebody in chattel shouted out I used to watch that every Saturday yeah that was the other big video game show that one was awesome
7364921	7381188	and then um I watched GameProTV especially when they did the Neo Geo review because I used to have that one on tape and then I moved out here and Dan had a Neo Geo and I was like holy shit these exist you know so it was pretty funny and um
7383344	7387767	I really liked Pole Position, which I've got all of that downloaded.
7387968	7388988	Thank you, Tiger Claw.
7389048	7390629	Video Power was the name of it.
7390649	7393291	Video Power, that was definitely it.
7394732	7396554	Did we used to have a listener named VidPower?
7396774	7397094	We did.
7397174	7397914	Yeah, we did, yeah.
7399295	7404639	Um, there was another one that I used to... Nick Arcade?
7405079	7405579	Nah.
7405599	7406440	Well, what about you guys?
7406460	7410482	Well, she's thinking Loki, Jason, anything you want to throw out there?
7410502	7414064	I missed most of those, and I think that's because I'm just a few years younger than you guys.
7414184	7416826	I wasn't... Oh, rub it in.
7416866	7423470	Nick Arcade, though, I was like a teenager when that was out, so you had to be... Well, that's been rerun to fucking infinity, unlike every other show.
7423490	7423790	True.
7424471	7425951	So Nick Arcade is what I live for.
7425991	7426532	There was one...
7427032	7433256	that made me react in similar ways that wasn't actually video game related.
7434337	7441941	I caught it on Fox Family, ABC, whatever that network has been, called Masters of the Maze.
7443482	7448806	It was a trivia game and you run through the maze with this big suit and a...
7450267	7459255	and your assistant uses a joystick to tell you which way to go and you have all these gadgets and doodads on your vest that don't actually do anything and a blind advisor.
7459335	7460296	It was silly.
7460836	7462518	Yeah, I love Nick Arcade.
7463559	7471586	When I was thinking about shows that I used to watch, PBS had this after school special show called Square One and
7472246	7472967	Yes!
7474690	7475831	That show was the bomb.
7475871	7477613	Mathman.
7477753	7478935	That show was the shit.
7478955	7480877	That came to mind as soon as you guys were talking about Qbert.
7481078	7481879	And MathNet.
7482579	7484602	That was one of my favorite shows.
7484722	7487245	I used to run the fuck home so I could watch Square One.
7487325	7488046	What a nerd!
7488106	7490890	I'm running home to watch educational programming, but that show was the shit.
7490990	7495173	I am glad people are reacting to the show because I've never ever heard of it since I saw it.
7495193	7496694	Oh, in chat room I'm sure they're lighting up too.
7496754	7499136	There was that and then 321 Contact was huge.
7499336	7505421	I was a little too young for Electric Company.
7505461	7506482	I don't remember that as much.
7506582	7508663	Yeah, I remember Electric Company.
7508884	7513347	So that one was definitely one for me.
7515356	7519284	but I'm trying to... Now I'm actually having to pull up a list to remember.
7519364	7520747	Hold on, I've got something for Jason.
7520767	7521067	You ready?
7521207	7521508	You ready?
7521869	7522350	You ready, Jason?
7522550	7525416	You've already seen this much of Square One TV.
7525856	7527039	How much do you figures left?
7528584	7529905	This is .44 on the screen.
7529925	7533687	Here we go.
7533807	7536709	Mathman, your mission is to eat only multiples of six.
7536930	7540392	When you encounter a number, you will have until the count of three to make your decision.
7540632	7542093	Is that so, Maddox?
7542113	7542994	Does he sound like him?
7543014	7545035	You'll eat you if you are wrong.
7545195	7546436	Oh, no, not the glitch.
7546476	7548817	Why did they ever turn this into an actual game?
7548837	7549258	Like we had...
7549898	7552279	72, is that a full six?
7552319	7552539	Quick.
7552559	7552539	72?
7552900	7554800	He ate it.
7555101	7556881	He's right.
7556901	7558422	This is why they didn't turn it into a game.
7558442	7559263	They had number munchers?
7559283	7559643	I think so.
7566506	7585194	Yeah, but that wasn't... 844... Okay, so I was looking at other stuff, other ones, Rob, and there was like a really crappy Street Fighter cartoon, American done, that wasn't, you know, actually as good as any of the anime were.
7586894	7593037	And I know that the, I think that the game was based off of, there was Battletoads, you know, which was pretty funny.
7595638	7622272	there was a Mortal Kombat cartoon that was really awful and Double Dragon our buddy from Video Game Realness Mega Man 400 is in chat saying no one watched the Mega Man cartoon because nobody mentioned it I caught I remember wanting to watch it I think I caught like five minutes of it while I was it was absurdly early in the morning so I woke up caught a pinch of it and fell back to sleep
7623137	7624338	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7640888	7643571	Oh yeah, I heard about that Yeah, yeah, yeah So it's kind of cool
7657495	7663584	We are currently being yelled at and lectured by Mega Man 400 and chat for the lack of the Mega Man cartoon.
7664525	7665967	At some point, I guess I'll have to check that out.
7666208	7667269	I love PBS.
7667329	7670013	Tiger Claw says there were cartoons that were single shot episodes.
7670133	7671435	Even Bubsy had one.
7671635	7672156	Oh, God.
7672236	7672597	Wow.
7672797	7673157	Bubsy 3D.
7673766	7674807	Actdeft, no.
7675827	7676467	What does Actdeft say?
7677007	7678448	I loved Reboot 2 as a kid.
7678588	7680029	I tried to rewatch it on Netflix.
7680069	7681529	It was terrible.
7682230	7682510	All right.
7683190	7683810	We got to move on.
7683850	7685051	There's still more gaming news to get to.
7685091	7688833	We could do an entire three-hour episode about children's TV shows that we grew up on.
7689613	7691794	And maybe that'll happen over the holidays when it's really slow.
7692554	7693635	That could be like a good list list.
7693675	7695316	But for now, we got to get to more gaming news.
7695556	7697136	You know what we just need to do?
7697556	7699717	We need to do a spinoff show called 30-something radio.
7702160	7702680	Right?
7703141	7705525	The geeks who were in their 30s, the radio show.
7705565	7706045	Oh, my God.
7706306	7708409	You might be on to something, DarkSakura.

7711053	7711754	Patent pending.
7714198	7741360	all rights reserved Loki so the launch of Battlefield 4 hasn't been that great apparently they've had server issues like crazy and DICE has been just kind of trying to get things fixed so to kind of help with that they have halted work on everything but Battlefield 4 so I guess that's going to delay that Mirror's Edge reboot and Star Wars Battlefront
7742640	7744561	and also the expansions for Battlefield 4.
7744941	7748542	They want to get the game working ASAP.
7749282	7751342	We know we still have ways to go with fixing the game.
7752002	7757264	It is absolutely our number one priority and the team at DICE is working non-stop to update the game.
7758544	7760845	We know players are frustrated and we feel your pain.
7760925	7762485	We will not stop until this is right.
7763645	7765446	So it's good to see that they're taking charge.
7765506	7772227	It's too bad that it took almost two months before they did that.
7772427	7776268	Yeah, I'm not a Battlefield 4 player myself, but I have heard there have been some issues.
7776448	7780349	And Codeman says the servers are shit on PlayStation 4.
7780629	7782310	EA game and servers are shit?
7784112	7786816	To be fair, a lot of games have launch problems.
7786896	7792604	My beloved Final Fantasy XIV Rome Reborn was kind of a shitacular experience the first couple weeks because of similar issues.
7792624	7794687	This game's been out for like six weeks now.
7795532	7796132	No, games?
7796352	7802994	Well, I have a skewed perspective because A, I actually played 1.0, and B, the beta went on for so long.
7803274	7804595	No, I meant Battlefield 4.
7804675	7805135	Oh, Battlefield.
7805215	7805675	Oh, yeah, yeah.
7805795	7806255	Well, yeah.
7806615	7808896	No, they didn't get on it as fast as they should have.
7809356	7810456	I agree with that.
7811237	7811517	All right.
7812077	7814337	So anyway, moving on with some other news.
7814998	7818599	This story is about a beloved system of mine, the Commodore 64.
7819699	7821920	Yes, I have Commodore 64 news tonight.
7822180	7822340	Ha!
7823660	7852337	this is cool because Paul Kohler and Mikkel Hastrup who did a port of Super Crate Box which was called Super Bread Box they did a port of Super Hexagon which was a more recent game but they actually ported that to the Commodore 64 so let me actually play a little bit of this in studio it doesn't really do anything at the beginning but then when it gets into the video here a little bit
7854269	7857192	Check out that sweet Commodore 64 synth music.
7858874	7860816	When it gets a little further here in the video, maybe.
7861196	7865160	But you can actually play this in an emulator or you can actually play it on a regular system.
7867623	7867883	Nice.
7867943	7868724	I'm rocking out.
7870325	7871406	I know what I'm going to play this week.
7871667	7873569	Props to you guys for doing this.
7873589	7875010	This looks great for a Commodore 64 game.
7876992	7883637	I wonder if Terry Cavanaugh likes the Commodore 64, considering that these two last titles have been Commodore 64-looking games.
7885358	7892943	For those who did not know... I think a lot of people... I think a lot of people were influenced by the Commodore 64.
7893003	7893624	That was actually...
7897286	7925461	with the exception of educational games and maybe one or two other random things like VET which I talked about three weeks ago I never owned a Commodore 64 so I'm pretty distanced from like tape loading and actually understanding it's extent of basic that you have to use and all that kind of stuff but I loved the games I played on Commodore 64 Space Taxi Beachhead some I want to say it was Top Gun but it was something dogfight like
7926781	7930803	I used to play the hell out of this game and it was by the makers of Beachhead.
7930843	7932443	I need to do a Let's Remember video for this.
7932483	7932883	Plug, plug.
7932923	7933684	Maybe I'll do that this week.
7934104	7935064	It's a good week for YouTube.
7935364	7936545	Yeah.
7937705	7939206	It was by the makers of Beachhead.
7939226	7939766	They did a game.
7939806	7944988	This is kind of wrong if you think about it, but it was definitely a relic of the 80s.
7945028	7946828	It was a game called Raid Over Moscow.
7947409	7948049	Do you ever play this?
7948069	7948669	Yeah.
7949249	7957254	It was a game where, like, literally there's nuclear warheads being launched out of Moscow into America, and you're kind of going to stop it from happening.
7957894	7960516	And it's kind of controversial at the time when it came out.
7960616	7962597	But anyway, I don't know, why are we on this topic?
7962617	7968421	Sorry, you got me on Commodore 64 kick, and then you said Beachhead, and I was like, oh, did you know the Beachhead makers made this game?
7968741	7969041	It's them.
7969266	7969526	Anyway.
7970707	7973508	Or we could just listen to awesome chiptune songs that were made on the Commodore 64.
7973948	7974468	I'm down for that.
7974688	7978149	Ooh, you know, could somebody write a new OLR theme in the Commodore 64?
7978510	7979450	Sid Chip, that would be rad.
7979470	7980810	Do it.
7980910	7981411	I can ask.
7981531	7983031	Doesn't Bobby do some of that stuff?
7983852	7984612	Maybe, maybe.
7985032	7985292	All right.
7986133	7986473	Anyhow.
7986593	7986933	Oh, good.
7986973	7991175	I'm not the only one that remembers Dungeon Buster in chat says, that's a great game, remembers that one.
7991295	7993016	I always flew the plane into the wall.
7993317	7997479	The very first thing you have to do is fly the plane out of a hangar because, you know, you got to get a plane out there.
7998079	8001621	And I always crashed it into the wall because I was seven and awful at video games.
8002862	8004763	Anyway, let's move on.
8005003	8006023	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
8006704	8010226	I'm actually, we're still talking about cartoons in chat.
8011126	8014168	And I will freely admit that I loved Vehicle Voltron.
8015832	8020919	And now I'm actually trying to find subtitled copies of Die Ruger 15 that it was based off of.
8021400	8023483	I've got all of Golion, which is fucking depressing.
8024664	8026927	So this is a little bit...
8028941	8057701	it's related to video games in the terms that it uses the the Kinect but there is a robot called Russell that is it was created by scientists at looks like a Vanderbilt University in Tennessee that uses the Kinect sensor to work with autistic kids and basically and for people who don't really understand autism very well um
8059915	8071382	Basically, the biggest thing with just about any range of it is having problems with social cues and being overwhelmed very easily by sensory information.
8072483	8077406	And with looking at a human face, there's a lot of information that a person can miss.
8078007	8085752	But working into understanding movements and interaction with a robot that has limited forms of interaction itself...
8086612	8092174	has been helping a lot of these kids acclimatize better into a neurotypical society.
8092294	8094734	So it's pretty neat.
8094754	8101576	There's a quote in here from one of the scientists behind it that says autistic children understand the physical world much better than the social world.
8102337	8107018	So since this isn't as complex as a human being, the child isn't overstimulated.
8107418	8117742	But the fact that it's using the Kinect to sense the child's movements and react to it is, I'd have to say, a pretty good application for the technology.
8119663	8119763	So.
8123366	8135419	It's nice to hear about what the technology for gaming is kind of doing for good out there, especially when there's been a lot of dogging on Kinect lately because it's a required part of Xbox One and there's really not a lot of games using it.
8135860	8141166	So it is kind of nice to hear some of these other stories that help kind of, oh, this is why this technology is awesome.
8141766	8142227	Exactly.
8142527	8142627	And...
8144869	8162594	I think that in this case too, like I said, where a human can basically give way too much information for especially a more advanced autistic case, having a robot that's giving much limited information is a lot easier to process and better for integration.
8163435	8167776	Our robot overlords will be kind to us.
8171015	8171435	All right.
8172035	8172516	Let's move on.
8172536	8173956	A few more stories before we get to the mailbag.
8174076	8174316	Loki.
8174856	8176137	All right.
8176357	8182659	So as I mentioned in my gaming week, I did play a little bit of Just Cause 2, the multiplayer mod.
8183399	8188681	It's right now they're doing their final beta test of the servers and stuff this week.
8189681	8203811	and it will be launching officially on Steam December 16th and they haven't given a price to it yet I don't know if it's going to be free or if it's just going to be something that there's a fee to but
8205052	8232488	so far so good and it's pretty fun so look forward to that I guess in a couple weeks and if you can definitely join up in the beta if they haven't closed out yeah I think jc-mp.com and you can sign up there and get a steam key to yeah to get the latest client there so recommend you do that if you haven't already
8234028	8234829	It's fun.
8236890	8238952	You've talked enough about that here on this program.
8240913	8242815	Your excitement for it makes me kind of want to play it.
8242835	8244996	Because I bet I can get the game super cheap.
8245016	8247879	Unlike Grand Theft Auto 5, it's still a little pricey.
8247959	8259167	I skipped Just Cause 1, but Just Cause 2 is the longest adventure hunt collectible game that I've played ever.
8259507	8260888	And I got to...
8263189	8286194	94, 95, maybe 96% completion finished the story started a second playthrough like this game is one that I'm actually going through completion on the frustrating part is that the game is bugged and you literally cannot reasonably get 100% collection in that game but this sounds fucking awesome so sad it's Windows only PC only and Windows only
8287702	8295304	Well, here's a game that you'll probably only be able to experience on PC only pretty soon, although not if the publishers are able to get their way.
8295364	8298225	It's Skullgirls, which I know a lot of people have been talking about.
8299345	8303087	This game is by publisher Autumn Games, and here's the thing.
8303527	8314450	They are terminating their business deal with Konami, because Konami was the ones that actually got the game distributed and got it onto the Xbox Live Arcade and onto the PlayStation Network.
8314850	8319373	Well, because they are severing their ties with Konami, Konami has asked that the games be delisted.
8319793	8327458	So Skullgirls will be removed from the PlayStation Network on December 17th and off Xbox Live Arcade before the end of the year when the contract expires.
8327999	8332862	Now, unfortunately, what's happening with this whole thing is that...
8334102	8342824	They want to replace Skullgirls with a different self-published build that actually has some of the improvements that the PC update had in it.
8343184	8361389	They're trying to get that out ASAP, but I get the sense they might have been blindsided by this a little bit, that this was going to happen so fast, because the design director for Skullgirls, Mike Zamet, said that the delisting is kind of like Final Fantasy VI's magic user casting Ultima before he dies.
8361409	8362049	Yeah.
8364016	8382710	so it is a bit of a thing but I mean if you're going to end an agreement these things are going to happen so I'm not really sure what to think in this particular scenario I just hope that the well I think it's good that they're going to kind of at least make the new version a little better and they're going to bring some of the improvements over
8382990	8383831	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8399569	8409236	But maybe they can kind of make lemonade out of lemons or whatever the hell you want to call it by kind of using this as like another way to kind of relaunch the game and get it out there.
8409676	8412978	Rob, when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager.
8413799	8415960	When life gives you lemons, you mix it with vodka.
8418963	8420684	And then burn their house down with the lemons.
8423144	8423944	Ooh, I like this guy.
8424004	8425004	Squirted in their eyes.
8425805	8426105	All right.
8427205	8429725	Let's travel to the mailbag.
8431266	8433526	I knew Actdeft was a fan of Skullgirls, by the way.
8433586	8435487	Actdeft in chat says, support the Steam version.
8435807	8437827	So you do still have a way you can support this game, if something.
8438207	8438407	All right.
8438827	8439887	I was actually tempted to get it.
8440368	8440548	Yeah?
8440788	8441648	Yeah.
8441728	8442208	It looks fun.
8442248	8443988	I haven't had a chance to grab it yet.
8444008	8447209	I just had a couple of friends on my Tumblr who were super obsessed with Skullgirls.
8447829	8451830	So I know a lot more about the backstory of the game without ever having played it.
8452310	8452450	So...
8452930	8453910	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
8456211	8457491	Every week you guys email us.
8457531	8460472	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails.
8460972	8462712	And the DarkSakura will go to the email bag.
8462732	8464072	She's going to dive in head first.
8464632	8465453	It's sticky!
8466713	8467133	Gross.
8468293	8470774	And she's going to see what emails are in there tonight.
8470794	8471814	We have a lot tonight, right, Jenny?
8471834	8474274	Oh my god, we got one from an old school listener.
8474794	8476095	Yay, I love old school listeners.
8476295	8480016	Do you remember... I love new school ones too, though, for the record.
8480076	8481256	Do you remember Asian Buddy Paul?
8481736	8481956	Yeah.
8482616	8487159	Hey, OLR, I was talking about gaming news at work one day and wondered how the podcast was doing.
8487499	8489621	I'm glad you guys are still going very strong.
8489701	8490802	And that's from Asian Buddy Paul.
8493063	8495245	That literally was an email just saying hey.
8496585	8497766	Sup, OLR?
8498267	8498887	Sup, bro?
8499607	8500508	Sup, bitches?
8502770	8503950	Yeah, we're still here.
8504010	8504811	We're just a little older.
8506634	8525343	This comes from Robert M Last episode you were musing about dubstep Christmas music I got a sample music track a year ago The Capital Kings version of Carol of the Bells Easily one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard I have heard that Pause for Rob to look it up on YouTube and play a podcast Oh my god, that's exactly what I was doing And for Jamie's ears to recover
8525563	8534705	They have that, actually, at this... There's a court nearby that decorates lights in all their houses, and they have one guy that has that synced up to music.
8534805	8535906	That song, actually.
8535926	8539647	I think I saw this in a YouTube ad, of all things.
8540767	8541947	Just in the last couple of days.
8541967	8543688	Oh, silly YouTube.
8543828	8546648	Alright, well, let me get... Let me get to it.
8546708	8547308	Alright, here we go.
8547529	8549109	I'll skip ahead a little bit in the song here.
8552424	8554527	This doesn't sound anything too crazy.
8554547	8555549	Let me skip a little further.
8555770	8556931	There you go.
8556952	8562801	There's the buildup.
8562821	8563302	Come on.
8571796	8573600	That should be right there.
8573720	8576907	That's what I want to record on all of my Christmas cards.
8576947	8578851	Now they have the audio Christmas cards and stuff like that.
8579132	8579472	Right there.
8579552	8580655	Merry Christmas!
8580735	8582458	And then it drops to the bass right there.
8585515	8586617	Okay, maybe it wasn't that one.
8586657	8590782	He had actually a really cool Christmas song that was dubstep, but I don't think it was that.
8591003	8592044	That wasn't very good.
8592865	8597672	Wow.
8598953	8601857	Which brings me to this most likely non-video game question.
8602578	8606641	Is there Christmas music you enjoy any time of the year, regardless of your own traditions?
8607221	8617387	For me, it's the Sonic Santa Claus and They Might Be Giants cover, Takosky's Nutcracker Suite, and of course, Vince Giardi's Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack.
8617567	8618988	Keep up the great show.
8621529	8623150	No, I hate Christmas music, to be honest.
8623811	8624331	I really do.
8624731	8625392	I never liked it.
8626772	8628473	Except Bing Crosby.
8628493	8629213	I love the crooners.
8629373	8631114	I get a little bit annoyed with it.
8631174	8632674	It's not that I really hate Christmas music.
8632714	8633975	It just goes on too long.
8633995	8636396	Christmas music should be like... I'm tired of Mariah Carey.
8636696	8638056	The week of Christmas.
8638937	8639397	That's it.
8640137	8643218	Not December 1st and certainly not the day after Halloween.
8643878	8644699	The week of Christmas.
8644739	8645159	That's enough.
8646899	8648800	I've got kind of a weird one that I like.
8650180	8654362	I actually like the soundtrack to Toys.
8655077	8658520	Yes, Toys had a really good soundtrack.
8658560	8661542	It's not really Christmas, but they had Christmas themes in there.
8662103	8665786	It was light and fluffy and airy for some of the songs.
8665826	8666947	It was Tori Amos, too.
8668428	8669389	Did a couple tracks.
8669489	8674212	It was the one that they had the choir of kids singing or something like that.
8674312	8675513	That one's pretty cool.
8676434	8676975	and Hans Zimmer.
8676995	8678316	I mean, Hans Zimmer is fucking awesome.
8678356	8678976	What can you say?
8679637	8681018	For the record, there is a Hanukkah song.
8681178	8692928	There's actually a couple of Hanukkah songs I will listen to and one of them is the Maccabeats music rewrite for Candlelight and I will listen to Miracle because I freaking just love Matas Yahoo anyway.
8693089	8693569	He's awesome.
8693969	8694590	Holy shit.
8694630	8697132	I didn't realize there were so many great artists on this.
8697252	8698954	They had Frankie Goes to Hollywood.
8698994	8700535	I didn't even fucking know he was on that.
8700575	8701516	That's pretty sweet.
8703276	8711861	I will have you know, I am getting lectured in a private message by Shane Alinko about dissing Christmas music, apparently, which I just did.
8712442	8718105	Shane Alinko, by the way, bought Skylanders on the PlayStation 4 this week just so he could get his Christmas Skylanders character.
8718725	8719206	Just saying.
8719306	8720787	That boy is obsessed with Christmas.
8721647	8724309	I've just been ignoring all my villagers talking about Jingle.
8725429	8727671	Except I'm writing down what presents they want for Toy Day.
8727831	8731133	You know they are selling that Skylander character separately
8732236	8733857	In a couple weeks, by the way.
8735857	8739899	Ikuma JP says, oh my god, in Japan, all Mariah Carey, all the way.
8740039	8741379	I hate shops that play that song.
8742059	8742340	Yes.
8742740	8744220	Kmart has been playing it on repeat.
8744400	8747962	And the only reason I'm going to Kmart is because it's right around the corner from my freaking house.
8748802	8750182	And they were the only place that had long underwear.
8750322	8757345	There was another one, Boy George, that's a big favorite in Japan, too.
8759607	8761008	There is a Christmas track I will listen to.
8761849	8764692	It was Pet Shop Boys, all over the world.
8765993	8766614	Christmas Mix.
8767515	8769356	Rob, you need to find that for me because I will listen to that one.
8771018	8772399	No, no more Christmas music.
8772439	8772960	What's next?
8775442	8777224	Kind of long email from AZHP.
8777264	8777805	I'll go ahead and read it.
8778925	8779625	He writes good stuff.
8779805	8780826	Hey, OLR crew.
8780846	8784127	Maybe I should channel my mother and use the accent.
8784847	8785848	No, just read the email.
8786208	8786968	AZHP here.
8787548	8794671	I just listened to that bit at the top of this week's show where a listener wrote in saying you guys shouldn't be biased towards Sony or against Xbox.
8795511	8796972	I think that's a load of crap.
8798032	8799073	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8823351	8826134	Loki has like four Xbox 360s.
8826455	8828957	He plays GTA 4 every day on one.
8829618	8832822	So why shouldn't he be upset that Microsoft borked the Xbox One launch?
8833563	8838608	It would be more surprising if he wasn't upset about it because he feels so passionately about the company.
8839009	8840150	We hate because we love.
8842438	8842838	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
8862632	8862812	Hold on.
8888044	8890445	We, um, again, we hate because we love.
8891085	8896986	Everyone's a little bit biased, but we're biased because we know what we want in our hearts, and when we get it, we're happy.
8897406	8900087	But we don't, but when we don't get it, we're unhappy.
8900567	8901627	Thanks for reading my email.
8901687	8909128	As someone who has listened to this show on and off since its beginnings, I couldn't sit by and watch someone leave the show just because you guys were, quote, biased.
8909228	8910049	Everyone's biased.
8910369	8911629	That's where our opinions come from.
8911769	8912229	Deal with it.
8912309	8913529	Yours truly is H.P.
8913669	8915450	OLR's premier gold star recipient.
8916911	8917875	Thanks for watching!
8919404	8924567	Thank you for remembering more than I do about the history of the show and some of the things we said.
8924927	8930151	But my one little thing is that I think the beginning of the email said something like, well, I think that's crap or whatever.
8930211	8933913	But let's not forget, you know, we got to respect everybody's opinions or whatever.
8933953	8941438	And I would just hate for the person who was just trying to give honest feedback last week to feel like, you know, like now everybody's picking on somebody for their opinion.
8941758	8942499	No, I know.
8942559	8944760	And I just want to make sure it's very clear to their opinion.
8944901	8945401	Absolutely.
8945641	8945981	Absolutely.
8946021	8947862	Everybody's entitled to their opinion, period.
8947882	8948463	I just want to make that.
8949364	8953607	We can go to the next email now though.
8953967	8956269	Alright, well I'm asking permission if I can thank somebody on air.
8956849	8957269	Oh, okay.
8957470	8958791	Someone just did something super nice for me.
8958811	8960672	So I'll go ahead and read this email.
8961112	8963354	Last week's opening was very thought-provoking.
8963554	8967577	I don't think that OLR is centric to any specific console or platform.
8968038	8973962	I do think that many of the viewpoints we hear on OLR are representative of the core gaming community overall.
8974442	8979065	though not necessarily representative of the more ambiguous and generic gaming umbrella.
8979506	8983228	The PS4 offers little to no change from what gamers have largely grown accustomed to.
8983688	8987671	It doesn't threaten the status quo and I think that it is very appealing to core gamers.
8988231	8995937	I can to a large extent understand why the ire against Xbox Ones is so pervasive on gaming sites, forums, and podcasts.
8996537	9001720	Anecdotally, people who spend no time on these types of sites don't share a similar attitude.
9002041	9003762	By the way, this is written very well.
9004142	9006367	with great grammar, although I do miss the Oxford comma.
9009870	9018492	As gamers, I find that our community often, and perhaps the internet in general, loves to revel in negative news.
9019052	9025494	To that end, I can agree with the poster that it can be depressing to be inundated with a wet blanket attitude even in the midst of a console launch.
9025874	9028975	A very rare and exciting time, in my opinion.
9029656	9033937	I am not suggesting that we should ignore the negativity and all slide down a magical rainbow while holding hands.
9034297	9034997	Dude, that sounds fun.
9035557	9036698	Only if there's sheet cake involved.
9037598	9047727	What I am saying is that we also sit back and smile once in a while with the amazing choices we have as gamers on nearly every platform and at a variety of entry points and simply marvel.
9048427	9059797	Every time I even think about getting bitter, my son reminds me how much he loves Mario Cat, Super Mario 3D Land, and how he wants a Pokemon party for his next birthday and I realize that gaming is still as great as we want it to be.
9060157	9061859	Hugs and kisses to OLR, DarkCharger.
9062233	9062814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9082495	9082835	and DarkSakura.
9103084	9105045	So, I mean, it is an exciting time.
9105085	9106766	Moments like this don't come around very often.
9107386	9112489	And I think from E3, this whole conversation has been very charged.
9112889	9123714	What was very different about last time is that when it was Sony and Nintendo launching in the same month, you know, everybody was hazing Sony because, oh, Sony's looking like a bunch of crayon eaters right now.
9124195	9125996	And, wow, Nintendo's kind of doing something different.
9126016	9129577	I mean, that was the mindset of the internet, quote unquote, back then.
9130118	9130398	Now...
9131138	9143704	I mean, sure you've got your Xbox and your Sony fanboys and granted Microsoft made a lot of missteps at E3 but what really was different this time was Sony calling them out.
9144444	9150487	That was a key difference and that's caused there to be a little more sting in this whole war.
9150867	9155769	I think you can trace that back to that very moment when Sony made the YouTube
9156429	9161270	of how to play used games on the PlayStation 4 where one dude handed the game to the other.
9162590	9171952	I mean, I know we're not quite to the point where we look back on the biggest news stories of the year, but I would say the release of that YouTube was the biggest news story of 2013.
9172452	9184975	I'll probably end up saying that again at the end of the year, was when Sony themselves put out a video of how to trade a used game on the PlayStation 4 because that was just, you didn't see that last gen, that kind of slapping, basically.
9185555	9185795	Anyhow.
9186675	9187156	DarkSakura.
9188496	9190497	I am defending my love of Digimon Zero 2.
9192018	9192378	Random.
9192638	9193859	But only the Japanese version.
9193979	9194859	I really liked that one.
9195200	9195920	The movies were great.
9196120	9196380	Anyway.
9197781	9201223	This one comes from Ye Olde Ragenator.
9203064	9204264	By the way, you know how that began?
9204324	9205165	The Ye Olde thing?
9206325	9206966	Typography.
9207926	9213189	There used to be a letter that they did not have a type for and it looked very similar to the Y so they used that.
9213629	9215110	And that's why we have Ye Olde and not The Olde.
9215330	9216592	Let's get to ye olde next email.
9236654	9245480	and easily understandable way to refer to a generation of consoles rather than going the long-winded route of saying something like the 360 slash PS3 slash Wii generation.
9247561	9256347	Number two, with Steam's winter sale presumably starting within the next few days, what games do the three of you think should be on everyone's radar and should be bought if it goes on sale?
9259467	9263028	Well, there was a game on my list, but Codeman got it for me.
9263569	9263689	Oh.
9263869	9265670	So I'm going to be playing Skullgirls when I get home.
9265790	9266170	Oh, nice.
9266710	9267170	Lucky you.
9267290	9267650	That's great.
9267670	9268031	Lucky me.
9268051	9269091	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
9269111	9269952	He's a nice boy.
9270172	9270772	He is.
9271992	9272433	To be fair.
9272453	9273933	Mothers everywhere should approve of him.
9274113	9280116	I gave him a little gift on behalf of the show earlier this week, so I'm glad to see he's paying it forward.
9280136	9280777	That's very kind.
9283078	9284379	What else was I going to say with that?
9284439	9287240	So what Steam games should Ragenator be on the lookout for?
9287280	9288521	Is that basically the gist of what I'm hearing?
9288861	9290902	What we are on the lookout for, I guess.
9291363	9292483	I'm probably going to get Final Fantasy XIII.
9292543	9294585	Because it should be out by then.
9295453	9295993	On PC?
9296173	9298414	Yeah, they were saying that there should be a PC release.
9298434	9299395	I didn't know they were doing a PC release.
9299415	9299815	I thought there was.
9299835	9300195	Are you sure?
9300375	9301496	I think I read it somewhere.
9301516	9303197	I think it would have been out by now if that was the case.
9303917	9306718	Okay, well then, Dan's the one that told me about it, so.
9307599	9308559	What have I been keeping my eye on?
9308639	9312221	I ended up buying, like, Stanley Parable was something I was going to get, and I did get that.
9312281	9313521	Gone Home I ended up getting.
9313581	9314762	Spelunky I ended up getting.
9315102	9319344	Like, all the games I had on my watch list I ended up getting this past sale.
9319404	9319604	Yeah.
9320604	9333031	If Final Fantasy VIII goes on sale, I will buy it for the sole purpose of giving it another chance, especially with this thing that Loki was talking about where you can fix the magic system and only have to draw once, even if it's cheating, quote-unquote.
9333851	9337693	I think that's how I play through the game now that I think about it.
9337973	9339654	I'll probably get it too if it goes on sale.
9339694	9340915	Yeah, that's one I'd be looking forward to.
9340935	9341836	I don't know why I...
9342876	9343196	You know what?
9343276	9349041	I did look this up, and it wasn't 13, but Dan had mentioned something to me, and I think I had it stuck in my head.
9349842	9352564	But I almost picked it up for Xbox.
9355466	9360190	I'm actually loading up Steam right now to see if there's anything that jumps out of my mind.
9360270	9362292	It's like something I was waiting on to get.
9362392	9364374	Officially released Just Cause 2 multiplayer.
9365374	9365755	Hmm.
9366975	9386737	it's not on Steam but Grand Theft Auto 5 Hotline Miami is on sale right now which I have and it's fun I think I got that in an indie bundle I completely forgot that I for that for my gaming week I actually started playing Hotline Miami I forgot my gaming week Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed was free this weekend on Steam and I played that too because it was free yeah so it's on sale right now too
9387057	9390499	Honestly, Ragenator, I think everything I wanted I really bought in this last sale.
9390579	9394742	I'm sure there will be more indie games that I see little screenshots of and I'll be like, ooh, I want that.
9394822	9395383	Ooh, I want that.
9395403	9401387	There are a couple that appealed to me, but I think for right now, like that Ring Runner one actually looked interesting.
9403488	9407491	But for right now, I still have The Shiva to play.
9407751	9409712	I have Skullgirls to play.
9409732	9410653	I have Deadpool to play.
9410673	9411393	Yeah.
9411834	9416237	So you're probably never going to see me on Final Fantasy again because there's other shit to play.
9418098	9431131	but then patch 2.1 will hit and it'll be like I need to just freaking get past level 31 so that I can do that stupid quest that I'm stuck on my Arcanist job quest anyway, whatever 3.
9432512	9441441	Final Fantasy 8's recent release on Steam yay, Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy 8, meh or Final Fantasy 8, fuck that shit I think we just answered that question
9442671	9449613	I don't... I mean, I realized there was a little bit of a Twitter debate earlier this week that I got caught up in, and, you know, I kind of started it, so I deserved it.
9450093	9454675	But I don't despise Final Fantasy VIII by many means.
9454855	9459316	I just feel a few key flaws in that game really ruin the fun.
9459856	9462538	and so I don't remember it as fondly as the others.
9462798	9463879	But it has a good story.
9464520	9475507	I mean, you know, it was especially considering you could have made a game that was very similar to 7 when 7 did so well, but they didn't and they went a very different direction with the story and I do applaud them for that.
9478292	9483015	I'm trying to be nice, y'all, but it's still the worst Final Fantasy game next to 14 1.0.
9483496	9483896	I'm sorry.
9483916	9485057	It's just how I feel.
9485097	9485957	Opinions, I have them.
9486418	9490260	They did bring up the Tamagotchi and handheld Digimon.
9490300	9495123	They were both brought out by Bandai, which the Tamagotchi came out first, then Digimon came so that you could battle.
9495223	9496104	I had the little ones.
9496584	9502068	The handheld LCD Digimon battler things.
9502588	9503369	And then I was like,
9504029	9509473	I think I remember naming my, because I evolved a Devimon first, and I remember calling him Satan Common.
9510813	9513135	That was his name, and I thought I would name a dog that.
9514255	9518578	Four, I'm thinking of establishing a weekly VOG night on Counter-Strike Global Offensive on Steam.
9519238	9523581	I know that unlike TF2, it isn't free, but it will likely be on sale soon.
9524341	9528524	Would be there are any takers available?
9528564	9529925	This email is brought to you by StarFlex64.
9529945	9530306	Do a barrel roll.
9551383	9579830	and last email which by the way we did have one from YYR but I he said he'd call later I have paid attention to the chat yes and I'm honoring the previous statement alright live is better hi OLR crew I said hi firstly that's what it says here firstly thank you all for giving me a theme song Sky made a great choice with conga feeling though I'm waiting for the day he screws up and plays Miami Sound Machine's conga by accident laughing
9581164	9582005	Wait, I got a better one.
9582045	9583006	I got an even better one.
9583106	9583947	Give it a minute.
9583967	9584387	Keep going.
9584407	9585589	I'll play a theme song here at the end.
9586610	9587971	But enough about you guys.
9588011	9589372	I'm here to ask your pal Jason.
9590553	9594337	One, since Jason is now doing intros, is he being paid in peanuts or Oreos?
9594678	9595619	I did give him a candy cane.
9596720	9597881	He drinks some of our juice.
9601004	9602926	He's being paid in love and high fives.
9603687	9630139	I am being paid in involvement which has been it's legitimately wonderful to do we said Jason if you'll help us out we will give you what we get from doing this show we will match our salary I get an equal share of what we get that's what he gets okay back to the email has Jason introduced OLR to the Game Grumps web show
9631061	9658191	I've heard of it I know of Game Grumps I know I have name dropped it and similar channels that I follow once or twice and I'm pretty sure I've even worn a shirt out here and not that I of course have any I don't have any connection to any of these other shows except as a fan but I do have some ideas of things that I think could be kind of pretty fantastic but we'll see if I can actually get in touch with people and make things happen
9658772	9675270	I don't want to rip anything off no promises to speak of but I consume a hell of a lot of content so many of these things take place in California anyway so it's a little bit more doable and not just something by Skype I have ideas
9675450	9676431	We'll see what happens.
9702889	9704550	The Polaris Network, just in general.
9704771	9709754	I drop in, see whatever videos catch my eye, and then move on to something else.
9711015	9714057	Game Grumps, crap, what's his name?
9714538	9716279	Gerard, JKCompletesIt.
9718300	9743842	Markiplier, I've been watching quite a lot of his stuff lately and I feel like, oh, Continue Show does not a let's play, not a review but hey, let's play a game and publish a video of the memorial moments 30 minutes or so of a game updates every Wednesday they're in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and they're pretty fun to watch too
9744342	9747004	Most of the stuff I like are the review ones like Classic Game Room.
9747944	9749405	And I really like Game Sack.
9749445	9750245	They're a newer one.
9750785	9751406	And Game Theory.
9751906	9752826	I don't watch anything.
9753067	9754227	I really don't.
9754347	9756648	I actually do not watch review things.
9756748	9758750	I watch active content things.
9758950	9767454	Every single person that I just named plays a game and either voiceover afterwards or running commentary while they're playing the game.
9767934	9774578	I just want to clarify, I support indie broadcasting and people doing it, but it's just like, I'm too busy.
9775638	9780481	I like to watch the stuff my friends do, because a lot of my friends are doing live streaming, so I do a lot of that, and I'm too busy producing.
9781422	9791387	But to be honest, I think of my favorites right now, I'd really have to go for Game Theory, because I like the fact that it breaks apart and analyzes it.
9791647	9795189	Did just catch that the other day because... Is Link dead one?
9795449	9799232	No, Mario's Affliction.
9799252	9806316	I can't remember the name, but basically the fact that he's actually kind of the anti-hero in the legitimate lore and everything in the Mario universe.
9807157	9810859	So anyway, to go ahead and close up this email, since that was the last thing.
9811139	9811539	That's it.
9811639	9812960	Have a good night at the Nasty Canasta.
9813921	9815442	Oh, and here for Nasty Canasta...
9819786	9823669	This is Konga from Beatmania 2DX4 style by Good Cool.
9824049	9826752	I told you I have something better.
9826872	9828093	This one's fun to play, too.
9828193	9829173	Nasty Canasta.
9831916	9832176	Anyhow.
9833137	9834798	See, I'm not the only one that likes game theory.
9835618	9840482	I tried it one time a while back to mix Konga and Konga Feeling together.
9840582	9841943	It doesn't work.
9842023	9842704	It doesn't work.
9842804	9843885	I miss your remixes, Loki.
9846138	9846979	Alright, is that it for emails?
9847700	9847920	Yes.
9848100	9848861	Oh, well then there you go.
9848941	9852785	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Now he's busy with genetic mixes.
9854627	9857489	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send emails.
9857630	9858851	That would be fantastic.
9859892	9865217	In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week because, you know, we're angsty some of the time.
9865858	9866498	A lot of the time.
9867479	9867840	All the time.
9882614	9889236	So I have to do a little bit of a story, and then I will say a big F you to this jerk face.
9889876	9894017	I was going to Target, and some people on my Facebook and Tumblr know about this.
9894037	9901080	So I was going to Target, and there was this big guy just smoking in front of the door, blocking the path, and I was like, eh.
9901560	9908842	So I tried to walk around him, and he kept putting himself in my way, so I just scooted on around because I'm shorter and faster, and he tried to grab my arm.
9909915	9912116	Going into the target, and I mean, this guy's bigger than Dan.
9912836	9913996	Huh?
9914276	9916437	Sorry, I'm about to go off, so finish your story.
9916497	9919877	Well, and he speaks in this whiskey voice, you know, the whiskey chain smoker voice.
9920537	9930000	And then, so he tries to grab my arm, and I pull back, and I said, I meant to say Neanderthal, and I called him Neolithic, but I said, don't touch me, you Neolithic sack of shit.
9931620	9935461	Because I was, by that point, angry, because someone trying to grab me
9936403	9936944	Is he legal?
9937744	9941548	Apart from that, it's something that sets me off immediately.
9941728	9942389	Who does that?
9943129	9944451	This is not high school.
9944531	9945352	This is not a bully.
9945372	9946312	This is an adult.
9946673	9950356	You don't grab somebody at random outside of Target.
9950456	9957163	To quote my friend who I discussed this with, she's like, he's the type of person who thinks that women are property.
9959208	9960589	It's disgusting.
9960869	9969572	So just going into this, basically what happens is that by the time I got inside the building, after I said this to him, I just kept dashing back on into the building.
9969832	9971953	He is going to get maced, and good.
9972413	9975555	He is going to grab the wrong person, and he is going to be maced.
9975595	9982637	Well, I'm going to tell you, just knowing the way that I react to things, had he touched me, I probably would have completely lost my shit.
9983378	9986359	Because without going into too much detail about my own past...
9987219	9990542	I have lost my shit before when someone grabbed me.
9990702	9991703	And it didn't end pretty.
9991923	9992164	Anyway.
9992644	9993044	Oh, sorry.
9993064	9994185	I didn't loop the F-U.
9994586	9995046	It's okay.
9995667	9997689	So, so... I was too busy being angry.
9997749	10001252	And I'm short enough and he's tall enough that if I had punched him, I would have punched him in the dick.
10001332	10001832	So, anyway.
10002653	10008258	So, I scooted inside Target and he's yelling after me, Come back here, midget!
10009379	10010220	You're a midget, really?
10010240	10010760	For a record, I'm 5'3".
10012341	10017908	But that's all he could say, and I was like, and it just, because I was so angry and so worked up.
10018209	10019631	I would have called the police.
10019731	10023896	Actually, if I had been with you, I, oh, it would have gone down at the Target parking lot.
10025051	10026452	Well, let's put it this way.
10026552	10035581	I was so worked up and so angry and so fucking close to a full-blown meltdown that I let it out the only way I could think of, which was hysterical laughter.
10036422	10040886	Just laughing my ass off, and this guy outside of here goes, Man, she's laughing at you!
10040966	10042928	And he's like, Come back here, Major, are you laughing at me?
10043288	10050515	And that's almost better than the physical punching in the dick, because I publicly humiliated him, and that was pretty funny, too.
10051275	10055038	So, um, so, and thank you, Alan, I love you.
10055218	10057841	He said, um, it's because DarkSakura had the gall to be a woman in public.
10060134	10067917	So basically, once I calmed down and had a fun conversation with the lady in the sock department and, you know, how she's like, yeah, I saw him out there.
10068137	10070418	I tried to teach my son never to be like that.
10070719	10072459	And I was like, bless you, you know.
10073120	10077642	And they ended up escorting the guys off the property and I think they did call in the cops.
10077662	10082344	But I stayed inside the Walmart, not Walmart, but Target for a solid hour.
10082544	10085705	And you know what was even worse about that is that the Hanukkah stuff wasn't on sale yet.
10088067	10097296	So anyway, so I just ended up just wandering around and looking at stuff and looking at toys and playing on the internet on my phone and finally left.
10097536	10104183	And though I have to say that leaving the place is like that sort of there's like a layer of calm that comes when you're in.
10104623	10104943	Moving on, Loki.
10134207	10135948	Alright, well, I only have one.
10136788	10139749	Lucky for the fact that I have to get my wisdom teeth out.
10140669	10143030	Dammit, I thought I was determined to be wise!
10145250	10152313	Um, I don't really have a lot to F you, so F you to my snacking habit.
10152713	10153613	It's out of control!
10154534	10155515	Did you like your candy cane?
10155676	10156056	I did.
10156116	10158379	I ate the whole damn thing.
10158640	10159240	I have a habit.
10159421	10159961	I love food.
10160842	10161203	Jason.
10162384	10164788	I had one sometime this week, but I had a really good week.
10164968	10165749	I'm not angsty.
10165829	10166430	Sorry, guys.
10167231	10168993	F you to Jason for not having angst.
10169794	10170094	All right.
10171454	10172995	I just need to catch my breath.
10173255	10180136	Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10180156	10181036	Let's try to run through these quick.
10181396	10181796	All right.
10181916	10192399	So Atari, maybe coming back, they have finally received court approval to come out of bankruptcy.
10193179	10199200	I guess they have a payment plan now that involves paying back $3.8 million owed to the bankruptcy lender.
10200060	10210346	And once they have that and they're operating on their own, they can start paying, I guess, $1.75 million to different creditors over the course of three years.
10211226	10216249	And apparently that's a small portion of the over $10 million that they're owned.
10217990	10222792	But hey, that'd be good because at least it's not another studio going under.
10225053	10226894	Maybe they'll make another Alone in the Dark game.
10230740	10231140	All right.
10231881	10232861	Well, good luck to Atari.
10233181	10233482	All right.
10234022	10235162	One other story for you guys.
10235182	10237704	And as I promised, we would do a story about pornography.
10238244	10243567	And this is a story from a website that really needs to consider their ad model because it's just annoying.
10243827	10246128	And this is why people get ad blockers, Destructoid.
10246449	10254813	But anyway, Destructoid ran this story about what Pornhub had to say about pornography on the various consoles that are out there.
10255393	10260056	And Destructoid actually called Pornhub or emailed or whatever people do to talk to each other.
10261838	10278816	Pornhub is targeting consoles for website support because that is where some of our users today prefer to access our site and our aim is to offer a great user experience across all platforms.
10279497	10280859	Now the stuff you really want to know.
10281460	10283263	Where are people watching their pornography?
10283303	10290714	Because, you know, the PS3, the PS4, the Wii, the 360, they all can have the internet and therefore you can get porn on it.
10291955	10294239	Yes, a Nintendo console, the Wii, can get porn.
10295520	10317339	Anyhow, so the majority of porn, Pornhub traffic comes from the PlayStation 3 55% of pornography comes from the PlayStation 3 The Xbox 360 accounts for 39% And the Wii, as this website calls it, a limp 6% That's just because, have you tried internet on the Wii?
10317379	10319001	It's awful So true
10319796	10321917	And technically, though, it does work, though.
10322778	10323038	What?
10323318	10325560	The internet on the way to bring up porn.
10325800	10326160	It does.
10326480	10326961	I remember.
10327161	10327701	We've done that.
10328101	10328341	Yes.
10328782	10330743	It was research purposes, of course.
10331644	10333485	Anyway, so congratulations, PlayStation 3.
10333785	10335806	You are the kings and queens of pornography.
10336327	10336887	Yay.
10337807	10341090	Let's go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10341190	10343911	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10344031	10345512	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10345552	10345953	Who's this?
10346793	10348814	Oh my god, it's following you.
10373956	10375216	Yes, it is following me.
10375537	10377097	It will follow you around the room.
10377277	10380438	It will basically like if you walk out of view, it's going to be like confused.
10380558	10381478	Oh, God, where did he go?
10381598	10382319	Oh, my God, it's Hal.
10382339	10382779	It's over here.
10382959	10384619	Clean that mess up off your table.
10384639	10385840	It's going to zoom in on my face.
10386200	10386600	Sorry.
10386840	10387400	That's all right.
10389381	10390801	Give me some wheat thins, bro.
10393742	10395183	You cannot have my wheat thins.
10396598	10396918	All right.
10397539	10399340	Well, congratulations, YYR.
10399380	10404063	You are the first Xbox One caller to the show.
10404583	10406224	So can I troll you?
10406284	10409546	Also, I'm sorry you have to see my messy living room.
10409586	10413809	I was actually thinking about cleaning it up for this call, but then I said fuck it.
10414349	10414630	Wait, wait.
10414650	10416151	Can I try something real quick, YYR?
10416171	10416971	Can I try something real quick?
10417311	10417792	Okay, hold on.
10418532	10418872	Xbox.
10418892	10419273	No!
10419713	10420453	Power down.
10421634	10422014	No!
10422675	10423395	Don't do that.
10423495	10425156	And by the way, it's not power down.
10425717	10426217	Oh, okay.
10426820	10427541	Turn off now.
10427861	10428902	Xbox, turn off.
10430223	10431644	Don't listen to Rob, Xbox.
10432564	10434106	He'll deceive you every time.
10434226	10435307	He'll lead you astray.
10436147	10436447	All right.
10436528	10437368	No, it's interesting.
10437588	10450218	I actually have a feeling that it somehow can differentiate between voices in the room and voices from the speaker because my girlfriend already tried this and it didn't work out all that well.
10450659	10451079	Didn't work out.
10451499	10455002	So you're making Xbox One video calls to your girlfriend, huh?
10456247	10465913	Yes, actually, what's interesting, I was cleaning up my place for the last two days and listening to the last two weeks worth of OLR, and I see you mention that you're in San Francisco a lot.
10465933	10466874	Well, guess where she lives?
10467594	10468515	San Francisco.
10469155	10476039	So, we may, depending on what happens, we may need to make some plans to, you know, meet, chill out, because she's actually listening right now.
10476539	10477660	So, she'll know who you are.
10477900	10479481	Oh, well, howdy!
10479681	10481562	When are you coming to San Francisco?
10481582	10485405	Because our buddy Jason is in San Francisco for the holidays, so...
10486357	10494942	Oh, well, I mean, I'm going to visit her for a few days on the 19th, but I'm not sticking around for very long, because I basically used up all of my vacation this year.
10496002	10502266	Well, look up VXChaseNXV, because he's in, I almost said Seattle, what the hell, he's in San Francisco right now.
10502386	10504467	Keep in touch anyways, let's see if we can work something out.
10504487	10504927	There you go.
10505828	10506288	That's cool.
10506815	10511239	So I'm listening to OLR over the weekend, and by the way, how's the audio?
10511279	10512200	Is it coming through okay?
10512520	10513060	It's good.
10513501	10521247	You can tell that your microphone, like you're not talking into a microphone, that it's like a room microphone that has a big gain, but it's fine.
10521688	10522128	It's good enough.
10522188	10524230	Okay, so I shouldn't try plugging this in?
10524911	10527273	I'd be curious just to see what the quality difference is.
10528211	10529012	Okay, well, you know what?
10529052	10531014	I'll plug in my little mic here.
10531175	10532476	He's plugging in a little mic.
10532556	10534298	This is still a radio show.
10534338	10537102	We might all be looking at video, but I know the podcast listeners can't see it.
10537402	10538824	Okay, can you hear me now?
10538944	10541447	Oh, that sounds like a normal call now.
10541467	10543069	Wait, I think I lost you.
10543309	10543790	No, we're here.
10543810	10543850	Hi.
10543870	10544551	Are you still there?
10544851	10546353	Yes, and you sound great, so talk.
10546834	10547434	God damn it.
10548315	10550156	And this became a one-way conversation.
10550396	10551356	Oh my god, yeah.
10551376	10554918	That's too bad, because he sounds better on that thing.
10555058	10560921	I had to suppress the urge to reach out my hand and say, turn the volume up in sign language, but we don't have a cam in here.
10560941	10561941	Right, we don't have a cam in here.
10562101	10563021	Maybe I need to go get one.
10563742	10569784	He's pressing buttons, and I see the lights in his room fluctuating like he's running through different screens.
10570184	10571425	Alright, well I just unplugged it.
10571445	10572305	Can you hear me now?
10572485	10574586	Yeah, we could actually hear you before, and you sounded great.
10574606	10574866	No?
10575027	10575287	Yeah.
10575527	10575707	Huh?
10576227	10577248	Now he can't hear us at all.
10577688	10578568	You lost it entirely.
10579349	10579889	Hello?
10580249	10580990	This is exciting.
10583951	10584612	Okay, he hung up.
10587954	10588974	Xbox One, y'all.
10589034	10589955	Wave of the future.
10591376	10591956	He's calling back.
10592636	10593997	Okay, he's calling back right now.
10597699	10600321	Well, I would have to say that was absolutely a success.
10600441	10600661	Yeah.
10601809	10603769	We could hear you fine that whole time.
10604250	10604790	Just so you know.
10604990	10605490	Oh, really?
10605550	10605810	Yes.
10607110	10610471	Yeah, because I absolutely stopped hearing you.
10610551	10613632	I tried unplugging the mic and I still couldn't hear you.
10613692	10615192	So, yeah.
10615472	10618833	Just $4.99 at your local Walmart or Target.
10618853	10621073	$499 US dollars.
10622193	10622473	Alright.
10623054	10623834	What else is on your mind?
10623854	10625334	You send an email to the show, right?
10626034	10629715	Yeah, basically after listening I'm listening to six podcasts
10630111	10631512	Seven hours worth of OLR.
10631812	10636475	And of course there were a few times when I'm just like, I wish I was in chat so I could respond to things.
10636876	10639978	But there were three things in particular that I wanted to bring up.
10641759	10648783	The subject of the discontinuation of spot pass service for Swapnote was brought up at least four separate times.
10649824	10653426	And I wanted to throw in my two cents on that.
10653487	10655428	Because at first I thought also, why...
10655953	10656653	Why did they do that?
10656713	10660215	Why couldn't they just drop the photo feature and leave the rest of it intact?
10660996	10677705	But I thought about it for a while and then I understood this had to be done because Swapnote unfortunately put kids and teens in touch with people who could, you know, take their pictures and do bad things with them.
10678726	10684149	And if they had just dropped the photo feature, it would have left these kids and teens
10685307	10689629	Or more direct something like, hey, meet me at this park near your house.
10689689	10690849	That, you know, kills that idea.
10690869	10691229	It stops it.
10705940	10713029	My biggest problem though, YYR, is that how come the kids are talking to these people unsupervised in the first place?
10713249	10718917	If a parent is concerned about it, why is Swapnote even being downloaded in the first place?
10718957	10720579	I think if the parents were more involved...
10721219	10742282	Then you wouldn't have this happen And this isn't something that's... I mean, this is horrible And we do need to stop predators from predating on children But disabling Swapnote is not going to do that Because there's always email There's always the internet and other forms They found each other somehow So I just kind of feel like, you know, well, why...
10744125	10744685	I don't understand.
10744705	10747726	You're absolutely preaching to the choir.
10747866	10753128	I completely agree with you that parents need to be more hands-on about what their kids and teens are doing.
10753369	10760491	But for the moments that they're not, Nintendo being as family-friendly as they want to be, that is what they chose to do.
10760631	10762432	And I understand it.
10762692	10763252	It sucks.
10763752	10770715	But I can understand that decision because they needed to cut off the contact between these two parties.
10772530	10780436	It just also further goes to show why we're never going to have video play on the virtual console, and I just think that's the wrong direction for Nintendo in general.
10780476	10781937	It sucks for the rest of us.
10782097	10783978	Yeah, it does.
10784279	10785019	But you know what?
10785139	10789603	I think that just comes with the territory of gaming on a Nintendo platform.
10790123	10792525	We're just going to have to do those things on other platforms.
10793971	10802934	Well, I think Nintendo's other thing too is that just because a parent should do something, they know not all parents will do something, so it keeps their reputation safe.
10803554	10805115	They have their brand to look after.
10805355	10806615	Exactly, exactly.
10807996	10812577	So, anyway, the second thing I wanted to bring up was Forza 5 microtransactions.
10813097	10820200	You know, it seems like you guys don't think it's a really big deal, but I'm going to give you three reasons why folks are up in arms about it.
10821060	10823281	Number one, in older Forza games...
10824141	10829925	By playing through the game and completing the challenges or whatever, occasionally you would get cars for free.
10830125	10832287	Hey, you cleared this thing, you get this car.
10832807	10835029	They don't do that anymore in 5.
10835489	10841874	You cannot earn cars by any means except buying them with credits or tokens.
10842374	10846237	Except for the very first car you get when you start the game, because how can you drive without one?
10846593	10876322	so it's not like what we were just saying about Gran Turismo 6 where you just unlock them through the course of the story I had the impression that these two games were in very similar boats you have to buy all of the cars now at least that's what I've read online I just started playing the game myself I haven't really gotten to a point where I would want to buy another car yet but from what I've been reading in Amazon reviews and GameFAQs posts and other places there are no free cars anymore except the one you get at the start you have to buy everything now
10877011	10878312	Ready for your mind to be blown?
10878492	10878792	Uh-oh.
10879452	10881313	This is how DLC cars work.
10881373	10882493	This is item number two.
10883754	10885955	You pay real money for the DLC, yes?
10886495	10886735	Right.
10888216	10896779	When you do this, this adds the cars to the game, but you cannot actually drive the cars until you buy them from the in-game shop.
10898360	10898620	Ooh.
10899460	10906063	And if you don't have enough credits to do that, you get to open your wallet again and essentially pay twice to use these cars.
10907261	10907743	Uh huh.
10908746	10908967	Yup.
10910245	10914368	I'm really hoping somebody in the chatroom here is going to jump in and say you're wrong.
10914688	10917210	Like, no offense, but I just... I would hope so, too.
10917370	10918090	That would be great.
10918651	10919951	I hope someone tells me that.
10920392	10927416	Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf went to bed, and I know he's been playing the game, so... He said the exact same thing, though, on his show, I want to say, yeah.
10928277	10930739	Well, you know, here's the thing.
10930759	10936502	Number three item, which basically makes one and two worse, is credits are earned slower in the game than they were in Forza 4, so...
10937865	10942348	DKBeast in chat at live.vognetwork.com says he's not wrong
10968424	10971026	One of the most expensive cars early on.
10971506	10973527	They give you a free other car.
10973907	10975788	If not, they give you that car for free.
10975828	10981411	But in order to get in on this, you had to buy the game at launch and join their Forza Rewards program or whatever.
10981471	10982291	I don't know what that is.
10982511	10982872	Wow.
10984032	10985473	So it's a mess.
10985613	10991396	And I really don't like this whole, you bought a $60 game, now we'll throw free-to-play type elements into it.
10992268	10994610	is something I hope doesn't last too long.
10994970	10996071	I really hope so.
10996131	10997432	I hope people reject that.
10998012	10999253	Anyway, you said you had one more thing?
11000054	11006338	The last point I wanted to make, on the subject of Loki being too harsh towards the new consoles, no, I don't agree.
11006498	11008160	I don't think he was overly harsh at all.
11008480	11011662	The fact of the matter is, the games aren't there yet.
11011922	11021149	I mean, I bought an X1 because I want to be one of the first developers who didn't get into the early program to put games on the system.
11022175	11024397	I didn't buy it because I had to have it.
11024857	11029360	The game I've most been looking forward to playing is Peggle 2, and that comes out tomorrow.
11030821	11031301	Good choice.
11032282	11035504	I got Forza 5, I got Dead Rising 3, they've mostly been sitting there.
11036345	11043910	So it's like, you know, the Skype thing is cool, the TV features are neat, but I don't use most of them, I just, you know...
11044474	11053798	It's cool to be able to say, okay, watch CNN or watch Comedy Central or whatever, and the Xbox One will push the buttons on your cable box for you.
11054658	11057239	And again, this call coming from an Xbox One.
11058459	11059480	It's cute.
11059560	11062421	It's nice, but it's not a have-to-have kind of thing.
11062721	11066383	There's no real reason, in my opinion, to own one of these boxes right now.
11066483	11066823	Wow.
11066923	11068984	And there's no real reason to own a PS4.
11070064	11070424	Not yet.
11070824	11071805	The games aren't there yet.
11072205	11072545	Not yet.
11073837	11075518	YYR, this has been a fantastic call.
11075618	11076059	I love this.
11076159	11077880	I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls.
11079460	11080701	One quick thing.
11081181	11081642	Really quick.
11082322	11091247	The last thing from Past OLR, Jamie pointed out that our society, our government, and our healthcare systems don't give enough attention to mental health.
11091887	11093868	Probably the truest statement that ever was.
11094309	11096470	This needs to be dealt with.
11096570	11097690	It needs to be looked into.
11097751	11099491	It needs to be focused on.
11099572	11100432	It's really important.
11101070	11101771	I agree with that.
11101791	11103314	Thank you.
11103454	11107781	YYR, thank you so much for binge listening to OLR and then calling us from your Xbox One.
11107821	11110025	I appreciate it.
11110065	11111608	Too much is never enough.
11111688	11112229	Take care, buddy.
11113110	11113511	You too.
11113591	11113951	Bye.
11114690	11119673	Always a pleasure to hear from him, and that was a lot of fun to go to the Xbox One for the calls, but whoa!
11120414	11121734	What the fuck was that?
11121754	11123095	Are we dialing into AOL?
11123155	11124276	Are we connected to a BBS?
11124716	11126117	Did we just call a fax machine?
11126137	11128058	Was that a fax machine that was calling us?
11128178	11130560	By the way, Rob, you know what's actually super funny?
11131641	11135383	Is that Tiara just beat Mass Effect 2, and she romanced Garrus.
11135623	11142830	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
11142850	11144351	But the phone is still ringing off the hook.
11144392	11145072	Let's go to it.
11145392	11146293	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11146313	11146634	Who's this?
11148235	11150037	Trying to fix my... Can you hear me?
11150217	11150898	Yes, we can hear you.
11150958	11151178	Hi.
11151839	11152800	I had to fix my headphones.
11152940	11155562	Anyway, I just wanted to call real quickly about Danny Wells.
11156103	11157164	Yeah, this is Kai Judo, right?
11157925	11158465	Yeah, Kai Judo.
11158545	11158866	Hey, buddy.
11158886	11159226	How you doing?
11160236	11160497	All right.
11161418	11164684	Yeah, what I just wanted to mention was I didn't know him as Mario.
11164724	11166827	I knew him as the bartender on the Jeffersons.
11167368	11169372	That's where he's mostly known for me.
11169652	11170393	Oh, my God.
11170453	11171195	That's right.
11171255	11172237	He was, wasn't he?
11172984	11174865	Yeah, he was Charlie on the Jeffersons for years.
11174985	11178646	So that's really where his notoriety comes from, you know?
11178746	11181848	So many talented people on that show are deceased, you know?
11182228	11184209	I mean, is anybody from that show?
11184349	11186470	I mean, I know we lost Sherman Helmsley.
11186870	11188851	We lost Roxy Roker a long time ago.
11188911	11191312	I mean, there's so many people from that show that aren't around anymore.
11191332	11193493	I think Bentley might still be alive.
11193793	11195434	I think Florence is still alive, too.
11195674	11196974	Oh, yeah, Florence is alive.
11197254	11198895	But I think Bentley's alive, too.
11199916	11200256	Not sure.
11201016	11202337	But yeah, that's where I knew him from.
11202417	11204679	And I was looking him up on IMDB.
11204719	11207281	I didn't even know that this is another video game related thing.
11207342	11210624	He did some voice acting for one of the Spooner Cell games.
11211585	11212926	So he's been connected with video games.
11213547	11214548	That's really cool.
11215208	11219372	Well, I like that you're recognizing him for things that aren't just Luigi.
11219392	11222314	I mean, obviously our community remembers him for that an awful lot.
11222334	11223655	But that's great.
11223696	11225998	That's some awesome little like trivia type stuff.
11226018	11226378	That's cool.
11227185	11227485	The Jeffersons
11246627	11247547	Well, we're moving on.
11248148	11249228	Freaking love that show.
11249328	11250429	Yeah, that show was great.
11250529	11252830	A spinoff of All in the Family.
11253170	11254410	Never realized that until years later.
11254530	11259833	Yeah, we could talk about TV for hours, but All in the Family had so many freaking spinoffs.
11261473	11265455	You can even count Good Times as a spinoff from All in the Family.
11265575	11266015	That's true.
11266035	11269797	Because the mother came from Maud, which was a spinoff of...
11271017	11272219	All in the Family.
11272739	11278686	We need to write all this down for DarkSakura's future I'm a Nerd in 30 show.
11280688	11284052	You're going to have an episode all about connections to All in the Family.
11286614	11287315	One last thing.
11288156	11289097	When you guys mentioned the
11290058	11316231	the game show that let you run around and like pick video games um I thought at first I thought you met this other game show that I love called um it was like uh it was a takeoff of the newlywed game it was called I'm Telling where it had like a brother and sister I remember that show that show was great yes that was yeah that show was great and they had a similar thing where they would let you run through a maze and like you hit like this little uh siren thing to try to match what your brother or sister picked and you would get all the prizes that was just cool
11316591	11317612	I so remember that.
11317732	11323235	And like, because I was virtually, I mean, I do have a brother and a sister, but they're 14 and 16 years older than me.
11323715	11326156	So I was kind of like an only child growing up.
11326196	11331359	And I always was like, I want to, I want somebody to go on this show with, but you know, it was never going to happen.
11331899	11332140	Yeah.
11332160	11333400	They should have did a friend's edition.
11333580	11334701	That would have been, that would have worked.
11334961	11335321	Yeah.
11335541	11336182	Oh yeah.
11336202	11336982	That's all I got for you.
11337102	11338863	Kai Judo, thanks for the walk down memory lane.
11338903	11339383	Appreciate it.
11339403	11339824	Have a good one.
11340744	11341264	You too.
11341304	11341524	Bye.
11342085	11344125	Great tribute to Danny Wells.
11344145	11345626	What about the other things Danny Wells did?
11345686	11346526	Those were great.
11346546	11346946	I love that.
11347306	11352028	You know, DarkSakura, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
11352328	11359770	You know, DarkSakura, if you were to do a show like that, like the nerd stuff and I'm 30 or whatever, I could sing the theme song for you.
11360330	11362991	Those were the days.
11363691	11364312	Answer the phone.
11368018	11368859	We don't like my singing.
11368879	11370820	1-877-GAME-OLR Oh, hi.
11371160	11372701	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
11372721	11373101	Who's this?
11373621	11375723	This is the one and only Ranma calling from Brooklyn.
11376163	11376903	Hi, Ranma.
11377003	11378124	And you're on webcam, too.
11378144	11379905	Are you calling us from your Xbox One?
11380986	11383327	I'm calling from pre-Xbox One.
11383607	11388650	It's called having Skype next to your Xbox 360 and chatting that way because it's a lot more fun.
11388910	11392072	And you can shit talk that way while having Microsoft kind of breathing down your throat.
11392312	11394454	So you're calling us from an Xbox Vision camera.
11395314	11397515	Actually, no, I'm calling from my awesome Logitech camera.
11397735	11398195	Awesome.
11399115	11403237	Well, I noticed you got your Luigi hat on and you got your Luigi coffee cup.
11403257	11404377	You have a Luigi coffee cup?
11404397	11404957	That's awesome.
11405077	11406398	Yeah, I got it from Nintendo World.
11406418	11409539	They also have a Happy Holidays Christmas mug as well.
11410019	11410339	Nice.
11410559	11412199	You're in your Luigi shirt.
11412299	11413640	I see a Luigi shirt.
11413900	11414400	What does that say?
11414460	11415721	It's mirror imaged for me.
11415761	11419082	It says the L. The L does not stand for loser.
11420222	11423363	So you are in full black Luigi mode tonight.
11423891	11425173	Yeah, something like that.
11425393	11429117	A friend of mine does a webcomic called Sucks to be Ouija and it's pretty funny.
11429498	11432301	And somewhere around here I have a... Oh, here it is.
11432902	11436005	I also picked this up from my soon-to-be tree.
11438328	11441212	A Ouija ornament that says Happy Holidays.
11441732	11442874	That's adorable.
11443908	11445629	Now, I got some stuff we got to talk about.
11445669	11447510	So, Rob, get the coffee on.
11447530	11448371	We got some talking to do.
11448511	11448951	All right.
11449451	11450612	I'll get out the cheesecake.
11451532	11452773	Oh, fabulous, fabulous.
11453834	11455375	Tell me about that one time in St.
11455435	11455695	Olaf.
11460418	11461298	Rob, you are something else.
11461979	11462239	I know.
11462579	11463239	I get that a lot.
11463439	11463780	No, really.
11463800	11464100	What's up?
11465174	11475837	So, to back what Kaijito said, that's where I knew Danny Wells from because when the show first came on, I spotted Luigi before I noticed Mario was done by Captain Lou Albano, okay?
11477217	11481099	So, that whole thing kind of comes full circle to me.
11481599	11481759	Yeah.
11483559	11486221	Also, I'd like to say, fuck yes to Square One TV.
11486681	11490164	That show got me to run home to watch it, okay?
11490284	11490765	Me too.
11491625	11496709	Got out of school at 3.10, I was there watching Thundercats at 3.30, Square One TV at 4.
11498110	11501133	I think Square One was on for us at like 3.
11501273	11504976	I had to get home fast if I wanted to see it, because elementary school you get out a little earlier.
11505036	11508759	PBS affiliates don't have a set schedule, it differs from every single market.
11508799	11513182	I think for us it was on at 3, but I think it was timed for when elementary kids get out of school, so it makes sense.
11514054	11519156	and if I missed it on one PBS station, I could catch it on another PBS station like an hour or a half hour later.
11519196	11520116	You have more than one?
11520136	11521496	He's New York City, dude.
11521936	11529759	Yeah, we have PBS 13, there's Channel 21, there's 25, there's... There's like 50 PBSes.
11529839	11531039	I've never heard of this before.
11531119	11532420	It's New Jersey Network that we get Channel 50.
11533380	11534220	Well, we get a few of them.
11534920	11536981	We've got Channel 6, take it or leave it.
11539315	11542937	At the minute of how you have your antenna, you can pick up stations from Connecticut.
11543018	11545559	Oh, that's right, because there's a PBS9 in Reading.
11545679	11547521	Anyway, cool story, bro.
11548481	11551343	Let's talk about TV channels in your neck of the woods.
11551503	11553865	No, no, let's not, let's not.
11555026	11565773	And what I just realized, with Nintendo rehashing all of these video games, Nintendo's becoming that old celebrity that's trying to relive their prime with yet another Greatest Hits.
11566393	11568215	That's what it's like this time, you know?
11568255	11568475	It's like...
11568775	11592866	You first have Donkey Kong Country and Donkey Kong Country Returns Donkey Kong Country comes back again I think the next one is going to be Donkey Kong Country comes out of retirement The only difference is maybe extra level or redone music or something like that Donkey Kong is getting up there in age Yeah, how about Donkey Kong gets out of retirement home Are you looking forward to the new Donkey Kong Country game or are you over it?
11593689	11594149	I'm over it.
11594429	11598651	Like I said, I'm only picking up a Wii U once, Bayonetta 2, and Mario Kart 8 comes out.
11598731	11600192	Other than that, it can wait.
11600612	11601932	Mario Kart 8 is what, April?
11602933	11603133	Yeah.
11603653	11606594	I don't think they really have a date yet for it, but I think it was around April.
11606934	11607614	April or May-ish.
11607714	11609855	I am living for Mario Kart 8.
11610255	11611496	It better deliver.
11612836	11614277	Even if it gets delayed, I'm like,
11615986	11620928	Yeah, if it's a great Mario Kart game, it'll be worth the wait.
11621448	11624129	Yes.
11624209	11625289	A couple of things.
11625449	11629971	I think last week or week before, I talked about podcasting and the Sound Blaster card and stuff.
11631691	11634792	Any desktop PC off the shelf can do the same thing.
11635185	11637266	You have to go into the settings and enable it.
11637606	11638106	You can do it.
11638526	11638626	Oh.
11639307	11642008	For some reason, my studio computer doesn't do it so well.
11642048	11648811	And I just want to point out, just for our listeners, Ranma's call quality is dropping significantly, so that's why his voice kind of changed a little bit.
11648851	11649651	I don't know what's going on.
11650011	11651412	He might need to stop his porn torrents.
11652112	11660996	Or, no, I just, sometimes, you know, with all the 50 PBSes transmitting signals in New York City, sometimes the signal gets a little clogged.
11661036	11663677	I'm not sure following porn by PBS, never mind.
11664983	11691000	Ranma, I think you're right, it is my porn torrents Finally, finally, somebody fesses that fuck up on this show Yes, Ranma, it was my porn torrents Thank you, you're an honest man I abused my files connection I get 66 megs coming down, 33 megs going up Alright, Ranma, a quick last thought to get out here before we let you go Yes, okay, my last thought is this Um
11691576	11699479	If you want to play classic Nintendo cartridges on your Wii U, turn your Wii U on, push start A, and a slot will pop up for classic cartridges.
11700639	11703740	Okay, go post that to 4chan and see if somebody believes you.
11704201	11712224	Alright, Ranma, it's getting very crackly and stuff, so I really have to let you go, but thanks so much for the call, and have a good one, okay?
11713646	11714227	Alright, bye.
11714887	11718810	Ranma, anime jam session on Tuesday nights, everybody, here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
11719571	11721072	We can probably squeeze in one more call.
11722413	11724775	There's a little ad on my Skype right now I just want to point out.
11725056	11728339	Talk to friends while watching live TV with Skype on Xbox One.
11728499	11728679	No!
11731633	11733175	There's no box for me to respond.
11733195	11739321	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11739481	11746348	I do want to see if I can at least get to some of these Twitter topics because we had some good Twitter topics come in and we're falling a little behind here on the show.
11746989	11748270	Loki, did you have any last minute stories?
11749388	11749548	No.
11749928	11750128	No.
11750329	11751689	Okay.
11752929	11753350	Let's see.
11754170	11761973	Surtur wanted to ask, he hopes that Bobby and us talk about Gran Turismo 6 tonight.
11762513	11763113	You know what?
11763833	11764353	We got it.
11764734	11764894	Yeah.
11764954	11766654	And Dan's been playing the crap out of it.
11767174	11767955	He really liked it.
11768035	11771076	And then he actually watched football, which made me wonder who replaced my husband.
11773200	11774301	Dan doesn't usually watch football?
11774642	11776504	He does sometimes, but usually with other people.
11776604	11777946	He was in there watching it by himself.
11777986	11779749	I'm like, where's my husband?
11780590	11780931	Who are you?
11782405	11788709	Spazinator tweets us and asks, Loki, quadruple cheese and quadruple bacon pizza or quadruple bacon double cheeseburger?
11788849	11789810	I can answer that, pizza.
11790951	11793613	No, because that much cheese on the pizza is actually not very good.
11794053	11796134	Even extra cheese on the pizza is not very good.
11796675	11806141	And when you do quadruple cheese, trust me, I've seen it before, it's not as good as you'd think because that's a lot of grease you're adding on there and it just throws off the magic ratio.
11806721	11807862	Adding tons of bacon, though.
11807882	11808462	Go right ahead.
11808742	11810483	You're taking that question way too seriously.
11810903	11811383	I know.
11811903	11814404	I think you didn't take it far enough, to be honest.
11814424	11817285	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11817305	11822027	I wonder if that was on our end, because we were getting more calls a minute ago, and now nothing is lighting up.
11822147	11822628	Sad face.
11823148	11824288	Okay.
11824388	11824748	Let's see.
11826349	11832612	Actdeft tweeted us, there's more info surrounding the Legend of Sonic 3's soundtrack.
11832652	11835673	I wonder if this ties into the whole Michael Jackson thing, because wasn't there a
11836724	11839907	Wasn't there like a... Somebody ran a whole thing on that.
11839987	11840748	He didn't like it.
11840888	11852159	Jackson didn't like the limitations of the sound chip, didn't like the way the... He didn't like the results of the soundtrack, so they still kept some of the inspiration, but ultimately he wasn't credited and specifically involved.
11852259	11854881	Apparently, though, this actually doesn't have to do with the game trailers thing.
11854941	11860124	Apparently, and this is the story that Actdeft leaked us just to kind of try to cover this quickly.
11860965	11870671	Fervor Records on YouTube posted some unreleased music tracks from the band The Jetsons.
11870871	11872872	Not the Jetsons, but the Jetsons.
11873213	11873573	Clever.
11873733	11879557	And one track called Hard Times was somewhat like the theme of Ice Cap Zone.
11880057	11897057	well why does that fucking matter because the keyboardist of the group who is Brad Buxer worked on the title along with Michael Jackson which he said in an interview he's not sure what material the developers used in the game but I guess it was remnants of that unreleased song very interesting so
11898439	11898880	You know what?
11898920	11900401	Michael Jackson had something to do with it.
11900701	11907147	And because Michael Jackson is such a perfectionist, I would fully believe that he just didn't like the way it was turning out, so he walked away from it.
11907247	11907507	Easily.
11907748	11908088	Easily.
11908368	11911291	I think that's the simple story we have there.
11913133	11915295	Let me get to the calls real quick here.
11915315	11916315	We got one more call coming in.
11916335	11917256	This will probably be it for tonight.
11917276	11918217	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11918237	11918558	Who's this?
11920239	11920900	Hey, Zaku.
11920920	11921720	We haven't heard from you in a while.
11921740	11922161	What's up, buddy?
11923214	11923974	Oh, not that much.
11924114	11928797	Just trying to chill on my night off.
11929877	11933339	Somebody turned out the lights, but we're getting a lot of video calls tonight.
11933619	11934119	I like this.
11934179	11935220	So what's up, buddy?
11936368	11938230	No, I'm just trying to clean up Steam right now.
11938250	11941233	I managed to get a second hard drive.
11941994	11953647	Well, actually, two of them set up in RAID, but the idea is I'm going to start moving my Steam games towards that one and then actually downloading whatever else I don't have, whatever else is in my backlog right now.
11954808	11957652	You look like you woke up at 6 in the morning to call this program.
11957672	11957752	Yeah.
11959253	11961056	I'm just like getting ready to go to bed.
11961758	11962218	It's all good.
11962278	11962659	It's all good.
11962679	11964742	Just don't mind the sore throat and congestion.
11965023	11966425	So what are you playing on Steam then?
11966606	11970312	What's your big Steam games of choice that you got to move everything around to make space and stuff?
11971294	11976698	Well, I'm just trying to get stuff like the orange box, all the other half-life games.
11977138	11981701	I guess I lost track and never actually got around to downloading it.
11982561	11989626	And then stuff like the first two Mass Effects that I have and Sleeping Dogs.
11991477	11991757	DarkSakura.com
12016918	12044206	um I I guess have you noticed like um I don't know if you cover this already but remember that fighting game Skullgirls yes yeah I get to play that tonight um apparently in two weeks their publisher Konami is uh pulling their games from the PSN and Xbox I caught you you did wake up just to call this show because we did talk about that about an hour ago so yes we touched on some of the basics of that but what what are your thoughts with that
12045748	12048758	I don't know, I mean, this is typical behavior of them.
12049781	12061844	I mean, if it's them like, you know, screwing over ITG or basically not giving a shit about the Mimani series, it's them screwing over independent developers.
12062064	12079169	Well, hold on though, because I mean, and granted, I'm not going to claim to be up and up on Skullgirls and everything that's going on, but my understanding from what I'm reading is that they had an agreement, the agreement is ending as of such and such date, so Konami says, well, if we're not going to be making money from this anymore, then yank, it's getting pulled.
12079827	12086652	But they didn't even inform their developers.
12089274	12090835	They did it behind their back.
12090975	12099461	Obviously, they probably knew about the end of the agreement, but they didn't even give them a heads up so they can plan a transition.
12101633	12103254	That's like bad business practice.
12103714	12118243	It's very unprofessional of them, especially if you're in a contract with another company that you're working with and you don't have the wherewithal to provide for a smooth transition for all the other customers using it.
12118945	12127429	Let me ask you this, because, you know, what would be the best way to kind of give that message to Konami that you're not happy with what they did?
12127489	12132171	Because obviously the answer is not boycotting Skullgirls because, you know, you want to support that game.
12132191	12132952	So that's not the answer.
12133452	12137574	And I don't think boycotting all Konami products is really a realistic answer.
12137814	12139575	Because they don't have much that comes out in console.
12139595	12141216	Yeah, there's not enough stuff coming out.
12141556	12148239	So if gamers are really pissed off about this, Zaku, like you are, what do you think is the best way we can express that to Konami and make them listen?
12148379	12152123	Stop buying their iOS and Android games because that's where all their business is now.
12153244	12157147	They basically, I mean, Babani's gone mobile at this point.
12157448	12169939	Other than niche pockets in arcades in certain parts of the country, if not the world, everything else is just them microtransactioning all their IPs, their music rhythm-based IPs.
12171640	12172741	That's pretty much it.
12172961	12176264	Yeah, that's been the state of Bomani for a few years now, which is sad and depressing.
12176284	12176764	It's not even that.
12176784	12187032	It's just in general, the principle of an independent indie dev trying to find a publisher or give them the light of day, but then at the...
12187768	12197554	On the other hand, they're actually not giving them the professionalism that they gave them during the whole process.
12198655	12210422	As I said, it's really what happens when you try to work with other clients and those clients in particular don't want to give you everything necessary to achieve business goals.
12210984	12216547	Well, I'd be curious to see if Konami does end up having to respond to this at all, but I don't know.
12216567	12224972	I just kind of have this weird feeling that they probably won't, and gamers will support Skullgirls on PC later on, and that's that.
12225032	12229694	What they're trying to do right now is they're trying to find another publisher.
12229974	12233736	Right now, in the short term, they're trying to get another build in.
12233756	12237559	They're trying to get an update in just to keep the game alive.
12238679	12240861	Saku, I've got to...
12254733	12255733	I've got to wrap this up.
12255773	12257494	We've got to go because we're running way late.
12257574	12258914	But you know what?
12259214	12267057	I'd be curious to see what the response is on a greater scale to this because obviously there's a lot of people that are pretty unhappy about this.
12267157	12268157	But I don't know.
12268177	12270058	I just don't know if it's going to be enough to make waves.
12270098	12270478	But we'll see.
12270738	12270958	We'll see.
12271258	12271478	All right.
12271978	12272739	Zaku, take care, buddy.
12272799	12273279	Thanks for the call.
12273339	12273819	Have a good one.
12273879	12274099	All right.
12274159	12274599	Sleep well.
12274699	12274839	Bye.
12274999	12275199	Bye.
12275399	12277180	Vitamin C. You look like you have a cold.
12278640	12279920	No, no more phone numbers.
12280141	12284381	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're running long tonight, so we've got to wrap it on up.
12284661	12290063	But please, you can always email us your thoughts, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
12290443	12294664	I had one other Twitter topic I wanted to hit on, and we didn't have last-minute stories, right?
12295744	12306386	SSJ100Matt tweeted us, this is sports ball related, but someone took the Alabama versus Auburn unbelievable final play and remade it in Tecmo Bowl.
12307895	12309217	Okay, I have to watch that.
12310338	12313641	Somebody put this in a way that would make Jamie and I care.
12314381	12315783	It's really the news I'm hearing here.
12315823	12317264	And then I have to show it to my mother.
12318265	12319846	My mom was reporting for Alabama.
12319866	12321207	Tecmo Bowl is great.
12321568	12323510	All right, we got to wrap it up.
12323550	12329575	We are so done because this is almost a four-hour show tonight, and it's not even a marathon show.
12329855	12332678	But thank you guys for staying with us tonight the whole way through.

12355311	12359134	I don't know if you guys know this, but we broke the top 15 game shows this past week.

12405655	12406475	I always look forward to it.
12407075	12408836	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
12411620	12415163	I am doing a very good job of having ideas, not writing them down and forgetting them.
12415503	12417285	So here is to forgetfulness.
12417305	12418626	You have a laptop in front of you.
12418646	12419807	I know, I know.
12419927	12423870	Launch that notes application and have it open at all times, sir.
12424071	12425752	Yes, I am definitely doing that from here on out.
12425892	12426453	That's an order.
12426953	12428494	All right, Loki, your final thought tonight.
12429855	12456672	um I also forgot that I played Surgeon Simulator 2013 today or I should say I let my son watch me do that it was more like knocking stuff off desk simulator because that's what I was doing because he was too afraid of the actual surgeries it's like I don't like this game um so yeah so that's all I have alright and DarkSakura your final thought tonight
12457426	12457688	Meh.
12458913	12459335	You know why?
12459556	12459757	Why?
12460259	12462349	Because I went Pinkberry and it's not cheat day.
12465465	12467206	I'm going to leave it at that.
12468668	12470890	Because I may or may not have something in the freezer right now.
12472532	12473132	I'll save it.
12473493	12474373	You bitch!
12474393	12475454	I'll save it.
12476495	12482521	My final thought for the night is candy canes are the best thing about Christmas.
12483442	12484804	Candy canes are the best thing about Christmas.
12485284	12487786	And that new candy cane flavor at Pinkberry?
12487806	12488287	Yeah.
12489147	12489407	DarkSakura.com
12515086	12516668	Alright, quickly, because we're going to play the credits.
12516989	12525100	We were at Golfland, and they had these big Pepsi bong bone drink things, and so I let Rob have a sip of it, and I said, I don't have cooties or anything.
12525120	12527303	He's like, okay, and took a drink, passed it back, and goes, I have gay.
12528525	12530968	And Irene was there, and I was like, oh my god, Irene, let's date.
12534269	12535530	And for the rest of the day, you did.
12537591	12538192	Kinda.
12538232	12538852	She just shrugged.
12539072	12539593	Maybe.
12540373	12542054	I know, Irene's pretty cute.
12544676	12547178	Thank you guys again for downloading the show and checking it out.
12547198	12548078	We really appreciate it.
12548358	12550220	We'll be back to do this all again next week.
12550480	12551981	Same bat time, same bat channel.
12552501	12554603	Have a great week in your gaming, whatever it is you're playing.
12554843	12555623	Just have fun.
12555863	12557705	It is an exciting time to be a gamer.
12557845	12558125	Good night.
12558991	12559912	Thank you for watching.
12588974	12590034	See you next week!
