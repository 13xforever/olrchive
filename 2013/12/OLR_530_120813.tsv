0	17160	The Video Game Awards have come and gone and some exciting news has come out of it.
17160	20640	Telltale picks up not one but two huge franchises slated for 2014.
20640	23040	While one may be the worst kept secret, the other may surprise you.
23040	29760	Your reactions, phone calls, and more on the show where every video gamer has a voice.
29760	35360	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35360	37120	where every gamer has a voice.
37120	45700	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode 530 for this December the 8th of 2013.
45700	49520	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me over the next few hours to talk video games and
49520	54400	gaming culture and gamer lulls and probably a lot of other miscellaneous talk too.
54400	57120	We have to fill three hours somehow.
57120	58640	She's joining me as she does every week.
58640	60840	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
60840	61840	Hi.
61840	62840	How are you?
62840	63840	Educated.
63840	64840	Educated.
64840	65840	The more you know.
65840	67800	Did you read a book today?
67800	70120	No, I've been watching documentaries all week.
70120	72640	Because that's what LeVar Burton taught me growing up.
72640	73640	Take a look, it's in a book.
73640	74640	Reading Rainbow.
74640	75640	Exactly.
75640	77200	I've been watching documentaries all week.
77200	78200	Oh, there you go.
78200	79960	They've been very interesting.
79960	84800	When I first got Netflix, or I should say, well when Netflix was first first out it was
84800	86120	only the DVDs, right?
86120	88960	So when I first got the Netflix streaming, whenever that was, it was a couple of years
88960	89960	ago, right?
89960	90960	Well, you know, ish.
90960	93840	One of the first things I did is I binged watched documentaries.
93840	97500	Like I went through that phase too because, you know, Netflix streaming doesn't always
97500	101240	have a lot of the current stuff, but they have a lot of the really like low budget,
101240	103820	I'm using my pointy fingers, like documentaries and stuff.
103820	105080	So it's a great thing to binge on.
105080	108700	There's actually YouTube channels now that are all documentaries.
108700	114840	And I've been watching a series called Extraordinary People on I think a few years ago in the UK.
114840	120200	And they really, really, really like autistic savants, but they meet people all over the
120200	121200	world.
121200	122200	It's actually really cool.
122200	126180	And a lot of surgery ones too, like people with odd growths on their face.
126180	130520	Speaking of British, I noticed that Netflix is, and this is like a paid advertisement
130520	131520	for them.
131520	132520	We don't get paid.
132520	133520	Pay us Netflix.
133520	137840	There's no little code we have or anything, but they do, they have a lot of BBC and British
137840	138840	programming on there.
138840	140940	I noticed that too, which is pretty awesome.
140940	144480	So do not insult Reading Rainbow by applying My Little Pony to it.
145120	146120	What are you looking at?
146120	149280	Our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
149280	150880	Of course you can join us in our chat.
150880	152080	What did Act Def say there?
152080	155240	Oh, Reading Rainbow dash.
155240	156580	Live.vognetwork.com.
156580	160120	We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right
160120	162800	after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
162800	164140	Also joining us here in studio tonight.
164140	165140	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
165140	166140	Hello.
166140	167140	How you doing, Loki?
167140	168140	I'm fine.
168140	169140	Awesome.
169140	170140	Awesome.
170140	173040	So, you know, there's a little, little parlor game that some of our chatters like to play,
173100	175840	which is what food did Loki bring to the show tonight?
175840	177880	And an old favorite returns tonight.
177880	180080	I haven't seen you bring this in like six months, but what did you bring to the show
180080	181080	tonight?
181080	182080	Triple bacon pizza.
182080	184640	Triple bacon pizza.
184640	186820	Good for the heart.
186820	187820	Low in sodium.
187820	188820	Yep.
188820	189820	All right.
189820	190820	Amazing.
190820	191820	I'll enjoy it.
191820	194300	Also joining us in the studio tonight as he has been on and off since Thanksgiving because
194300	196300	he's spending the holidays in the area.
196300	201040	So why not give it up for VX Jason XV, X, Y, Z, L, N, O, P.
201040	202040	DBQ LOL.
202040	205940	I'm sure everybody's very surprised to hear my voice again, but always great to be here
205940	206940	as usual.
206940	207940	And always nice to have you.
207940	210400	I'm it's we get adjacent for the holidays.
210400	212440	It's my Christmas present to everybody.
212440	216360	No, it's, it's, it's always great to have you are we, the more people in the studio,
216360	219720	the merrier, you know, unfortunately you don't get a lot of, it would be great if we were
219720	222900	all in San Francisco or something where a lot of people kind of come through and make
222900	225440	you losers drive an hour and a half to get down there to me.
225440	226440	Yeah.
226440	229800	In Sacramento, it's a little harder to get the people up here to actually sit in studio
229800	230800	with us.
230800	235360	But, uh, you know, if you're ever in the area, let me know, always open a guest.
235360	237180	It's it's, it's, it's conveniently located.
237180	242040	You guys have an airport, you guys have a train station, you don't have an airport and
242040	247240	running water, the whole government in California, 40 degree temperature week.
247240	249080	And yeah, isn't that hilarious?
249080	252720	How cold I'm using my 20 fingers, how cold it is right now.
252720	256640	But it's like I tell people, um, you know, or like when it rains, you know, dark soccer
256640	259800	loves to say, California, you guys don't know the rain.
259800	263200	You got to spend some time in the south where it really rains or you know, what have you.
263200	265240	But what about the rains in South Africa?
265240	266880	What about the rains in Spain?
266880	267880	Falls mainly on the plane.
267880	268880	Okay.
268880	269880	Toto.
269880	275840	Um, uh, uh, the record, the weather right now is like February in Alabama.
275840	279760	Well, I was gonna say though, one thing to keep in mind, we're not built for certain
279760	280760	things.
280760	282800	Like if it were to rain here, like it is in the south, we'd all be under water.
282800	284640	We'd be part of the ocean, right?
284640	286600	And now all of your houses would fall over.
286600	290480	And with the cold, you know, we have, we have like outdoor pipes and stuff here is
290480	291480	very common.
291480	292480	And when it gets really cold.
292480	293480	And houses made out of plywood.
293480	294480	Yeah.
294480	297840	Wrap your pipes, bring your pets in cause it's just not normal here.
297840	302480	So you've never had to know the pleasure of filling your bathtub full of water and putting
302480	306880	a teaspoon of bleach in it so that you have clean water when your water stops working
306880	308280	after a hurricane.
308280	309280	No thank you.
309280	315440	You've never seen a tree the width of this table be uprooted right in front of your eyes.
315440	318280	I will take the earth shaking randomly under my feet any day.
318280	320520	I will take a hurricane any day.
320520	322600	So it's 36 degrees here right now.
322600	326560	Is this when I, is this when we play guess what it is in Colorado right now?
326560	327920	Negative 20 I'm sure.
327920	328920	Close.
328920	329920	That's the feels like.
329920	330920	No.
330920	333480	It is currently nine degrees and will be one degree before the show is over.
333480	334480	Wow.
334480	338420	What up G in chat at live.voggenetwork.com says, I love the snowball games today.
338420	341960	You know, not, not that we talk a lot about sports ball here on, here on OLR, but I got
341960	343880	to say, I actually saw some of that game today.
343880	344880	Yes I did.
344880	348720	I saw some footballs today and uh, that was hardcore that they were out there playing
348720	352320	in the snow and like it's the type of thing where like that you can't even see the damn
352320	355720	lines that like they have to project the lines out there cause you can't even see them cause
355720	356720	the damn snow.
356720	357720	They're paid employees.
357720	359640	They better play in any kind of conditions.
359640	361980	Oh no Rob, you were, you were a band geek.
361980	365960	So how about this marching competition in the snow?
365960	371320	We never had the snow, but we had to do field show once in the pouring rain and so many
371320	372320	of us slipped and fell.
372320	375740	Like I slipped and fell in a mud thing, but you just get right back up and keep going.
375740	380760	The last marching band competition I did was in Prattville, Alabama, which Prattville,
380760	386520	um, and it was in the snow and we were all fucking cold and you had all the clarinet
386520	388800	players that had the fingers cut out of their gloves.
388800	390240	Did you play clarinet?
390240	392320	No, Jamie played saxophone.
392320	394160	All right.
394160	397640	Anyhow we could talk band geek stories all night, but it is a video gaming show.
397640	400120	So let's get back to the topic of video games at hand.
400120	401740	Uh, tonight's kickoff topic.
401740	403860	Ricky is actually going to start us off with our kickoff topic tonight.
403860	406980	It's something a lot of people on Twitter and everything's been talking about.
406980	409220	So I'm sure some of you are wondering when we were going to bring it up.
409220	410220	So here you go.
410220	411220	Yeah.
411220	415460	It's just, we're going to talk a little bit about the VGX award show thing that they had
415460	421620	yesterday on spike and it was also streamed on Twitch and all that fun stuff.
421620	424300	Lots of interesting things coming out of that.
424300	431060	Um, mostly just some new trailers for things, um, announcements of some things we'll get
431060	432060	into later in the show.
432060	437540	Some other stuff we'll get into later and, um, uh, at least one cool game that, um, or
437540	441900	brand new game that I saw, um, well actually it was several brand new games, but one from
441900	446340	like an indie developer, um, that was, uh, no man's sky that looked pretty awesome.
446340	451500	It was kind of stole the show and at least that seems to be the consensus.
451500	457340	Um, I saw that trailer cause I did not watch the VGX, but I, I, and I kind of always said,
457340	459640	I'm like, any of the good stuff will be on YouTube afterwards.
459640	460640	So yeah.
460880	464520	I did see that trailer and it was, it was neat, but I couldn't like, I was like, well,
464520	465520	what's the game?
465520	469960	Like, you know, it looked neat how it was going from underwater to land, a sky to space
469960	473360	in just like one fluid motion and the art style was very neat.
473360	476480	So yeah, I was kind of like, Oh, this is neat, but what is it a shooter?
476480	478440	Cause I see bullets being counted in the corner.
478440	480720	Is it a, what the heck game is it?
480720	481720	I don't know.
481720	482720	Yeah.
482720	485400	That's the only thing that kind of gets me about it is I'm like, all right, cool story,
485400	486400	bro.
486400	487640	What's the game?
487640	488640	It just looks interesting.
488640	489640	Yeah.
489640	493880	And then, you know, I, I look forward to the next chapter and what this game's on.
493880	494880	I'm not dissing the game.
494880	497320	It looked really good, but I just, I'm curious, you know, well, okay.
497320	498320	What else is there?
498320	499320	Well, okay.
499320	504920	So basically the, the main thing about this is there's been a lot of conflicting opinions
504920	509680	about the show since this is going to kind of a whole change of venue for, you know,
509680	510680	the VGAs.
510680	513920	Now it's this new, there's no audience really.
513920	518200	It's just kind of this studio set and they have developers on, they're interviewing them
518200	519700	with different things.
519700	523840	To me, it seemed like a very long version of, you know, their game trailers show that
523840	530440	they normally have on, on Spike and except, you know, they gave out awards and they had
530440	534880	Joel McHale and a lot of people didn't like Joel McHale because they thought he was just,
534880	539560	you know, hating on the entire show and not taking anything seriously.
539560	544320	And which, I mean, if you're a paid presenter, you're, I don't think that he's doing that
544320	545320	on purpose.
545320	551760	But whatever, um, and you know, he made some major faux pas as well.
551760	552880	That should be called out.
552880	556320	Like he, and to some people you may go, Oh, what's the big deal.
556320	561800	But you know, again, if you're trying to break out of that whole machismo, you know, gaming
561800	565200	culture and it's only for a certain type of people, especially coming off last week when
565200	568620	we had a guest that was really talking about inclusive games, you know, Joel McHale made
568620	572560	a pretty off joke in the first 10 minutes of the show, something about Wario getting
572560	579160	a sex change, which can be construed as transphobic, which, you know, I realize there's a fine
579160	585720	line between are we too sensitive about getting offended easily and you know, and so forth.
585720	591720	But it's just kind of the thing where it's like, you know, I just, as a joke like that
591720	597600	kind of just leaves me very like sour puss face when we're all about trying to include
597600	599400	more people in gaming culture.
599400	604400	Let's get away from gaming being just about dude bros and, and that sort of thing.
604400	609760	But I don't know, maybe Spike TV feels some sort of allegiance to that demographic.
609760	610760	I don't know.
610760	614980	But I just, when I, again, I didn't watch it, but I heard about it and I was just kind
614980	615980	of, I just kind of made a sour face.
615980	620040	Well, some of the things like that he said were kind of ironic, I guess, because you
620040	623600	know, the whole thing he's like, he's like, yeah, we're going to have lots of, you know,
623600	629640	trailers and demos and basically stuff that you can consider one long giant, you know,
629640	631600	video game commercial or something.
631600	635120	And I understand that it's supposed to be a joke, but at the same time, that's kind
635120	636120	of what this is.
636120	640040	It's just a big fucking commercial for these games.
640040	642840	And that's why the whole thing kind of seems like a joke in the first place.
642840	647260	If you want to say even more of a joke than the VGA's were, at least the VGA's was actually
647260	652060	presented like an award show and you could kind of imagine, or at least you make believe
652060	657960	that it's an award show and not necessarily something that is used to drive certain properties
657960	661320	ahead and good for marketing and that kind of stuff.
661320	665860	But I just don't know, it's harder to take this seriously, especially when they come
665860	671380	out of the gate looking like this and it looks ridiculous.
671380	675300	It's kind of like, you know, if we had a bigger budget or like if someone had a bigger budget
675300	680460	out there and just filmed themselves talking about what they think is the best games, even
680460	686360	though I know that they had an internet poll to nail down some of those winners and stuff.
686360	690020	But I just, I don't know, I can't really take it seriously.
690020	693960	Let me ask this question, then why do we, as a gaming culture, I mean these things only
693960	700120	have enough clout and power as we give it, why do we continue, and I'm even accusing
700120	702760	ourselves here, why are we even talking about it?
702760	706760	Why is gaming culture obsessed with this show?
706760	710120	Because Spike TV clearly wrote it off, they'd rather air cops rerun it.
710120	713920	I think people are more obsessed about the show because of the exclusive trailers and
713920	715040	stuff that they show off.
715040	719260	It's basically the new stuff that we get to see that people, I don't think really a lot
719260	726700	of people, aside from getting an affirmation that, hey, X series that I like got an award
726700	731500	or something like that, look, I'm justified in my liking this series or something, or
731500	732500	complaining about that.
732500	739620	The general video game culture conflict between different people and opinions and stuff like
739620	740620	that.
740620	744000	But for me, that's kind of one of the reasons I would tune in, is just because of the new
744000	745000	trailers.
745000	748260	And yeah, I know I could swatch them online, which I was going to do, but I just saw that
748260	751680	there was a link to a stream, oh yeah, I didn't know they were streaming that online, I checked
751680	756840	out about 10 minutes of it, and thankfully saw that trailer for No Man's Sky, my son
756840	760000	was watching too, and he's like, I want to see that trailer again, I want to see that
760000	761000	trailer again.
761000	762000	Let me get a couple comments here, Jamie.
762000	768280	Well, I was just thinking that, part of me wonders how much of it is driven by sponsors.
768280	773540	If they're getting X amount of revenue dollars, then they have a continued reason to keep
773540	777380	doing it in whatever way they want to, as long as they keep getting the money in, right?
777380	778380	Of course.
778380	779380	Jason?
779380	783520	I was just going to say, it's the leaving sports ball on in the background to watch
783520	785340	the commercials effect.
785340	789020	So you think a lot of people were watching it very passively, where it's like, well,
789020	790760	it's a Saturday, there's nothing better.
790760	794640	Award shows are long, and there's enough, it's something that you don't necessarily
794640	797240	have to see just until you have to.
797240	801180	So you can glean a lot of information by having it on and having it around in lieu
801180	805220	of doing something else, but then as soon as they talk about a studio that you really
805220	809660	enjoy or a game you're chomping at the bit to see more content of, it's like, okay, now
809660	813180	I'm going to pay attention, I'm going to give my active attention to this instead of my
813180	814180	passive attention.
814180	819940	And also the thing kind of represents, a lot of people think Jeff is kind of a corporate
819940	826660	sellout, especially with the whole Doritos and Mountain Dew thing, and they have him
826660	830120	dress up like the Doritos pope and stuff.
830120	834640	Well, this is almost like an example of corporate sellout type of thing.
834640	837720	I'm going to say something that actually might surprise some people.
837720	844280	I'm going to defend him a little bit, because I kind of think at his core, he is really
844280	845560	not a sellout.
845560	852140	I actually think at his core, he really is a gamer like you and me wanting to do a job
852140	853180	out there.
853180	859360	I think to some extent what's happened is, it's either this or nothing.
859360	861940	And I think he kind of realizes that.
861940	865600	In some ways, I think this was kind of a last ditch effort to kind of save this sort of
865600	866600	thing on Spike.
866600	869280	I mean, let's be real, it wasn't on TV.
869280	873240	This thing was on its way out the door of broadcast TV or whatever.
873240	878760	However they want to spin it, the reality is they showed cops reruns instead.
878760	883300	So I kind of think at his core, he wants to do good things, but unfortunately there's
883300	889060	only so much those sponsor people and the suits and the people that are so out of touch
889060	891100	to this are willing to go.
891100	897340	So maybe that's why he was open to the idea of turning to the internet and trying to let
897340	900760	it sort of go a new direction and so forth.
900760	905140	So I give him credit for that, but unfortunately it's kind of one of those, this was your chance
905140	906140	and you blew it.
906320	910960	Well here's the thing is, I don't think that it, why is everyone so situated on the fact
910960	913400	that this stuff needs to be on TV?
913400	917520	Most people nowadays, especially in the gaming community, don't watch a lot of TV.
917520	921320	It's all about internet stuff now, all internet broadcast shows.
921320	926560	Hell, you have people that used to be on TV like Adam Sessler doing web shows now.
926560	931360	You know, I'm sure that he could easily, hell, he's backed by game trailers.
931360	936040	He could easily go to game trailers and have his own damn show that's more serious and
936460	939500	still has the same type of people on there.
939500	945060	And he doesn't have to bow to the corporate sponsors of Spike or whatever, MTV, to have
945060	947340	all this nonsense that's in there.
947340	948660	That's what I think they need to do.
948660	953640	There is definitely a way out of, it's not this or nothing, there's plenty of options
953640	954640	out there.
954640	960200	It's just they try to do it again, and props to Spike for at least still considering gaming
960200	965140	as a viable thing to have on their network, because fuck, G4 just gave up on that.
965780	968880	Let me go to the chatroom, because there's a lot of comments on this, of course, in the
968880	973520	chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, it is the show where every gamer has a voice after all.
973520	977120	ActDeaf says, again, take out Joel and it would have been fine.
977120	981560	BlackWolf says, I like what they tried to do, but they needed to do it, not try.
981560	985580	And I bet, again, that's a little bit of the battle between the suits and so forth.
985580	990120	Bobby also goes on to say, you know, Jeff has done some amazing journalism stuff.
990120	994160	Jeff's The Final Hours reporting is wonderful, and I think a lot, I don't know a lot of people
994180	995180	that would argue with that.
995180	996180	Exactly, and that's why it's kind of a disappointment.
996180	1001700	I mean, his game trailer show's good, you know, I have nothing bad to say about that.
1001700	1003140	It's a great show.
1003140	1008780	And it's just, it's kind of embarrassing that he's this good, and yet here's this.
1008780	1013340	Here's a couple other comments that are really deep, and this is really good stuff.
1013340	1018340	SSJ100Matt says, and this is in response to why do these awards even exist and so forth.
1018340	1023980	SSJ100Matt says, because we're a society that needs a winner and a loser in something.
1023980	1027840	Award shows in general give people validation that their favorite thing is better than other
1027840	1030420	people's favorite thing.
1030420	1032280	Be damned if that doesn't hit the nail on the head.
1032280	1033280	100%.
1033280	1034280	100%.
1034280	1035280	Absolutely.
1035280	1036420	I mean, and that's not even just games.
1036420	1038280	I just talked about football a minute ago.
1038280	1040560	I mean, isn't that kind of the big thing behind football?
1040560	1042320	My team's better than your team, right?
1042320	1045600	I mean, that's a lot of culture right there.
1045600	1047120	They have even the Espys.
1047120	1050480	Oh, yeah, well, yeah, and it's just not even, it's not even just that.
1050480	1051480	The Oscars.
1051480	1052560	Especially western culture.
1052560	1054560	The Oscars, right?
1054560	1061900	People get obsessed with being able to call the Oscar pool or whatever at work and that
1061900	1062900	whole thing.
1062900	1064780	I mean, that's just a part of culture.
1064780	1065780	Absolutely.
1065780	1067660	And especially in gaming.
1067660	1071700	Xbox One fanboys versus Sony fanboys versus Nintendo fanboys.
1071700	1073300	That absolutely goes on.
1073300	1077380	Well, then you've got the other people who just laugh at them.
1077380	1078380	Let's see.
1078380	1079380	Also in our chat room.
1079760	1084080	I was actually going to say, but even that in and of itself is sort of a, some people
1084080	1086680	sort of get on their high horse about not being competitive.
1086680	1087680	Right, right.
1087680	1088680	Yeah, I know.
1088680	1089680	Yeah, there is.
1089680	1092680	I mean, you have to have a little fun with it and you know, it's, you don't want it to
1092680	1096120	be the kind of thing where, oh, everybody wins an award because you know, I'm the kind
1096120	1102840	of guy that owns every console and I give everybody a fair opportunity.
1102840	1104240	I would like their income.
1104240	1109200	You know, Dan and I, Dan and I used to be in that boat and now we just like, we're kind
1109220	1110220	of like, we don't care anymore.
1110220	1111220	I guess.
1111220	1114660	Seriously, if I was making an income that he's probably making on, you know, that show,
1114660	1116940	I will wear a fucking Doritos Pope hat.
1116940	1119540	I don't care on TV.
1119540	1120700	I will sell out.
1120700	1125020	Akuma JP says my milkshake is better than yours.
1125020	1126020	Could you teach me?
1126020	1127020	Would you have to charge?
1127020	1128620	I have more boys in the yard.
1128620	1132780	Thank you for that, Jason.
1132780	1136580	Uh, when you're the one just sprouted up, when you're editing this, when you're editing
1136600	1139000	this week's show, be sure to crop out that little sense.
1139000	1140000	All right.
1140000	1143320	Uh, no, I really want to read this serious comment from Scott, a Tron, cause this is important
1143320	1147480	to in our chairman at live.com Scott, a Tron says, Joel kept making jokes about gamers
1147480	1149980	being virgins and living in their mother's basement.
1149980	1153960	Exactly what gamers want to hear during an award show for the gaming industry.
1153960	1154960	Just dumb.
1154960	1158960	If you ask me and you know, I had that criticism.
1158960	1164160	When I came back from gamer X, I had a few choice words to say about one of the monologues
1164180	1169660	that I saw Pandora box give who, you know, she kind of made a lot of those jokes too.
1169660	1174900	And I'm like, okay, Pandora, you might be at like a G L B T Q I that whole thing quilt
1174900	1175900	bag or whatever it is.
1175900	1179420	You might be at one of these types of conventions, but it's also a gaming convention.
1179420	1182020	Don't get, don't get up here and offend gamers either.
1182020	1185820	And that was something I, you know, as much as I love her and still do, I just was really
1185820	1186820	put off by that.
1186820	1190620	Uh, when I came back from that, I just think Joel's material, maybe he's a little old cause
1190620	1195040	he was kind of doing that, you know, at the Ubisoft stuff when he, um, you know, was hosting
1195040	1196040	that.
1196040	1201240	It's just, it's getting new material, uh, but Rama counters with this and says, if geeks
1201240	1204440	can't make fun of themselves, then what the fuck are we?
1204440	1205440	But I don't know.
1205440	1211640	I think it's a little bit different when it is someone that you count on to do it appropriately.
1211640	1212640	Yeah, I agree.
1212640	1213640	And I don't agree.
1213640	1214640	Like I do agree.
1214640	1217720	We have to be able to get offended a little bit and that's why I'm not here raging more
1217720	1220600	about some of this, but it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, okay,
1220600	1223820	the, you're living in your basement shit is old.
1223820	1224820	It's old.
1224820	1225820	Joke is old.
1225820	1226820	Yeah.
1226820	1227820	It's kind of like these jokes we've heard before.
1227820	1231460	It's kind of like someone named Richard and someone calling him Dick is like, ah, yeah,
1231460	1232860	I've never heard that before.
1232860	1239580	You know, it's very sex change joke is just like you, you can do better than that.
1239580	1240580	It's tacky.
1240580	1241580	You can do better than that.
1241580	1245300	Like, especially in this day and age, like you're smarter than that.
1245300	1250180	It's like if you're going to go for the insulting jokes to be fun, to be funny, go from the
1250180	1255480	Lampanelli page, but don't, you know, don't think that you're actually being funny.
1255480	1260040	Go look at South Park cause I think that shit's really funny, but granted they offend everybody
1260040	1264600	and it's just, but anyway, that show has gotten incredibly stupid.
1264600	1266200	I don't know.
1266200	1267880	The last few episodes are pretty good.
1267880	1268880	All right.
1268880	1270720	Um, anyhow, so, so whatever.
1270720	1274440	I mean, again, I'm not, I'm not like, Oh my God, I'm so mad about the VGX.
1274440	1277040	I'm not mad about the VGX by any means.
1277040	1278040	Yeah.
1278040	1279040	That's kind of where I'm at.
1279040	1283380	I'm like literally asking the question where I'm like, why is this such a big fucking deal?
1283380	1286820	Kind of disappointed that there wasn't anything like, you know, a fallout four trailer and
1286820	1290060	it was just like, it's like, Hey, here's a new trailer for Titanfall.
1290060	1291060	Yeah.
1291060	1292060	Yeah.
1292060	1295700	I wish there was more new game announcements, you know, it was just kind of like, you know,
1295700	1297540	new trailers for games that we've already seen.
1297540	1301340	Keep in mind, we're at the halfway point between E3's too.
1301340	1307140	So I think there is definitely a, uh, a drive out there, a call for like a winter E3 type
1307140	1308140	of thing.
1308140	1312760	And I think the video game awards are a winter E3, a winty three, a wintry three, wintry
1312760	1313760	three.
1313760	1314760	Yeah.
1314760	1315760	That type of thing.
1315760	1316760	You know what I mean?
1316760	1319080	Like a, like something, some news to be a tent pole between the different E3's, you
1319080	1323560	know, just something to kind of keep us going until the next one.
1323560	1324560	But I don't know.
1324560	1328100	I felt the announcements that came out of previous, the, the, the VGX's or whatever
1328100	1330120	were, were better, were stronger.
1330120	1331120	You know what I mean?
1331120	1334140	Then, then what we got this year, steam is more exciting.
1334140	1336620	Steam sales are a lot more exciting.
1336620	1340880	I probably shouldn't ask this question, but it just kind of spring to mind listening to
1340880	1341880	this.
1341880	1345840	Collectively, the four of us, are we out of touch?
1345840	1351680	No, Jason, because we're gamers and this is, this is, this is something we talked about
1351680	1352860	a little bit last week.
1352860	1356560	I don't think we're out of, I don't think we're out of touch because again, the crux
1356560	1358680	of the show is where every gamer has a voice.
1358680	1359680	We are gamers.
1359680	1360680	We have voices.
1360680	1361680	We use them.
1361680	1366160	So maybe that, maybe that's the wrong question to ask, but I, I really wish I could remember
1366160	1369460	the detail of something that I was thinking about in one of these last couple of weeks,
1369460	1372940	but basically what it boils down to is that there are, there are obviously multiple sides
1372940	1376700	to everything and there is nothing, there is nothing wrong with, with one individual's
1376700	1377820	opinion against the other.
1377820	1382120	They're both right, despite the points we just made five minutes ago.
1382120	1388920	But it's kind of like we, it's, it seems weird to me because collectively we've said the
1388920	1392940	same, it feels like we've said the same thing for a month, a big collective sigh at the
1392940	1400260	future, despite the fact that consoles continue to shatter all records constantly, console
1400260	1401260	sales and everything.
1401260	1405540	So out of touches, that was definitely the wrong question to ask, but I want to, it would
1405540	1414780	be very interesting to find how we, how we deviated from the fact that almost all of
1414780	1419340	us, if not all of us owned every console of the last generation, it was like, you know,
1419340	1423780	we grew up, we grew up with our parents and we had the one that we wanted or the one that
1423780	1425420	our parents got us.
1425420	1428380	And then we grew up more and we, we went for more and more.
1428380	1433200	And then we had jobs and we had income and we invested in the entire generation and took
1433200	1434200	everything in.
1434200	1438420	And now we're here, the door is open, we can do what we want and we'll get there.
1438420	1443500	But let me tell you where I think your viewpoint skewed a little bit because I mean, I, I get
1443500	1446820	where you're going with, with this, but there's, there's a couple of things that caught my
1446820	1447820	ear there.
1447820	1451140	One is that it's not that the future looks bleak for gaming.
1451140	1452660	I don't believe that.
1452660	1456680	It's just none of us were ready to jump on the bandwagon right now.
1456680	1459420	There's not the games to justify that right now.
1459420	1462380	But to say the future looks bleak, not necessarily.
1462380	1467140	There's some very exciting things on the horizon and, and we continue to push things forward.
1467140	1468900	I'll give you a great example, Jason.
1468900	1472780	It's something we don't talk about enough here on the show, the Oculus Rift.
1472780	1474020	Really freaking cool, right?
1474020	1475980	I know Bobby Blackwell's gonna back me up on that.
1475980	1482020	That quite literally changes everything because it was done, it was done to an incredibly
1482020	1487460	limited extent in the nineties and then it meaningfully disappeared until last year.
1487460	1489100	So does the future of gaming look bleak?
1489100	1490100	No.
1490100	1492900	As we get one step closer to the holodeck, the future of gaming looks awesome.
1492900	1495700	It is awesome because now we're going to get a new lawnmower man movie.
1495700	1499580	But do they, but do they, do they need my money right now?
1499580	1500580	I don't think so.
1500580	1504260	Jason, if you think back to those consoles you did have as a kid, how many of them did
1504260	1507340	your family really get on launch day?
1507340	1508340	I know my family.
1508340	1509340	Yes.
1509340	1510340	We had a Super Nintendo.
1510340	1511340	We had a Nintendo.
1511340	1512340	I got a PlayStation.
1512340	1515040	None of those consoles did I have in the first year.
1515040	1518260	And in some cases, I think a Super Nintendo was out for like three years before I got
1518260	1519260	one.
1519260	1522220	I have never owned a console on launch day.
1522220	1525260	See when you're, when you're the big kid and you get to make the purchases, then you get
1525260	1527220	to, you know, kind of make some more of those decisions.
1527220	1531100	So it's not that we don't support the next generation of gaming by not getting those
1531100	1532100	consoles right away.
1532100	1533100	We just get there eventually.
1533100	1536980	I just go, the realistic is, you know, now I've got to juggle the rest of the bills and
1536980	1537980	so on.
1537980	1538980	Anyway, Jamie, I know you're done.
1538980	1542380	Here's the other thing too, is that we have experience to back us up where we have been
1542380	1546840	there for system launches and we have gotten things close to launch window.
1546840	1552260	You know, I mean, Dan and I waited in line for our, um, our Dreamcast.
1552260	1557180	I waited in line for a Wii, you know, actually Kristen and I bribed our place in line.
1557180	1562660	In line at target with, with Krispy Kreme, um, you know, the other systems, Dan was able
1562660	1567740	to get day one because he managed a GameStop, you know, we've had the ends.
1567740	1574200	We took advantage of it, but now it's like we have that experience of the disappointment
1574200	1575200	that's come afterwards.
1575200	1576200	Well, okay.
1576200	1580260	The, the Chinese weren't off Dan's done with, you know, Twilight princess.
1580260	1581260	What do we do now?
1581260	1588540	Um, I could sit here and try to play, uh, trauma center on Vicodin cause that was right
1588540	1592420	after my surgery too, you know, sorry, go ahead.
1592420	1597740	I'm just saying that a lot of the people that you see waiting in line now aren't people
1597740	1602700	who have more done, you know, maybe game launch weights or have had people to do the weight
1602700	1608300	for them, but now they're getting the experience of getting it home and then going, well, what
1608300	1610180	do I do now?
1610180	1613660	You know, what's really funny that I'm just now realizing, cause I'm thinking through
1613660	1616940	in my head, like, what did I buy on launch day and what did I buy in the launch window
1616940	1618260	and so forth?
1618260	1624660	And every system that I bought on launch day, every single one of them that I had on the
1624660	1628540	launch day that I actually said, you know what, I'm going to buy this purchase.
1628540	1631820	Do you, I bet you can guess, do you know what they all have in common?
1631820	1638780	No, uh, actually, actually, yes.
1638780	1639780	Compilations slash history.
1639780	1647020	No, no, they're all Nintendo, which isn't, which isn't going to do the, the people that
1647020	1651340	call me a fan boy and he, and that whole thing, any favors, but just real it, I'm going to
1651340	1652340	fess up.
1652340	1655860	I'm, I think that I bought a Wii U on launch day, I bought a Wii on launch day, I bought
1655860	1661020	a DS on launch day, I bought a 3DS on launch day, uh, I didn't buy a GameCube on launch.
1661020	1665580	I didn't know I didn't buy that, but you know, of, you know, of the games, the systems
1665580	1668620	I can think of that I actually did punk down the money on, um, on launch day, they were
1668620	1670140	all Nintendo.
1670140	1672820	And I'm trying to think in my head right now, like, well, why is that Rob?
1672820	1675820	Why did you buy those systems, but yet you wouldn't do it for the PlayStation four so
1675820	1676820	forth.
1676820	1681400	And again, it's about the games that were out and we, you had a Mario game I really
1681400	1686900	wanted to play and it had the zombie you and, and you know that the, we had Zelda, you know,
1686900	1690900	and amongst that was the big decider for me and so on and so on.
1690900	1696000	You know, and 3DS and DS were a little bit different granted, but you know, they were
1696000	1697780	strong enough where I bought one on launch day.
1697780	1699740	Did I buy a Vita on launch day?
1699740	1702660	I don't think I did, but I bought it really close.
1702660	1704420	So Vita was close.
1704420	1710980	Well Dan and Dan and I, um, before that, cause he had gotten his Saturn at launch and I think
1710980	1715580	he, yeah, Dan got his Saturn at launch and we got our Dreamcast at launch and we got
1715580	1718900	an import Dreamcast soon after Japanese launch.
1718900	1723220	Um, so we were like that with everything Sega did.
1723220	1726500	One thing I haven't brought up on the show in a while is that I kind of took a siesta
1726500	1727500	during that.
1727500	1730220	Like I wasn't like when I was in college, I actually, I was going through some other
1730220	1733500	stuff personally, so I actually wasn't as big of a gamer during that period.
1733500	1739020	So I kind of missed the, uh, the Dreamcast launch probably right on up to the PlayStation
1739020	1740020	two launch.
1740020	1743900	I think that finally started to bring me back in the fold thanks to DDR and everything.
1743900	1747180	And then I got into this show, which really got me back into video games again.
1747180	1748920	But uh, I kind of missed a gap there.
1748920	1752180	So, but I kind of feel like if I was gaming, I would have bought a Dreamcast on launch
1752180	1755180	day.
1755180	1756180	I have to tell you the truth.
1756180	1758420	That was actually one of the most fun launches I've attended.
1758420	1759420	No, I bet.
1759420	1760420	Loki, any thoughts?
1760420	1763180	Um, we kind of strayed a little bit from the original topic.
1763180	1764740	I'm sorry, but this is good stuff.
1764740	1766420	I would blame Jason for that.
1766420	1767420	My fault.
1767420	1768420	Yeah.
1768420	1773220	Um, I bought, well, I didn't buy anything this generation will for launch stuff otherwise.
1773220	1779340	Um, but the PlayStation, Xbox 360 wasn't quite at launch because they were sold out.
1779340	1782900	And so I got one from Craigslist and so I got that near launch.
1782900	1788020	I mean, it was pretty close, but I bought like almost the entire library of launch games
1788020	1789020	when they came out.
1789020	1794820	So, I mean, and I was vastly disappointed by a lot of them because it was just like,
1794820	1797500	eh, it's not that great, but I don't know.
1797500	1802700	Assuming I can budget again, I will have a PlayStation for January, February next year
1802700	1804980	is when I'm looking to get my PlayStation for Xbox.
1804980	1808820	One will be like late summer, probably the holiday season console.
1808820	1812860	I'm just like, I don't even really, I still don't really need a PlayStation forward.
1812860	1814340	Like there's nothing upcoming.
1814340	1815340	Infamous looks good.
1815340	1816340	That's for me.
1816340	1817340	For me there is though.
1817340	1819540	And we'll get to it later in the show.
1819540	1825500	Well, I was also going to say there's some, uh, you know, some chatter in here about,
1825500	1828500	you know, different people having different systems at launch.
1828500	1834340	The other thing too, that made system launches different for me and Dan was that when the
1834340	1837820	last gen came out, he was managing a GameStop.
1837820	1840940	So it wasn't like we had to go and wait in line.
1840940	1845980	He could just go to the store and pick it up, you know, it'd be behind the desk.
1845980	1849900	We weren't going to, the only reason we waited in line for the Wii, I waited in line for
1849900	1852320	the Wii is because we weren't originally going to get one.
1852320	1853860	So we had no order on it.
1853860	1857580	And then we were trying to, you know, wait in line for OLR.
1857580	1858580	That was fun though.
1858580	1859580	It was kind of fun.
1859580	1861460	I had a good time hanging out with Kristen that night.
1861460	1866580	And then there were the people that were walking, no, he wasn't that one with us, but then there
1866580	1870060	were the people walking up at, you know, eight in the morning right here to buy one.
1870060	1871060	Sorry.
1871060	1872580	We only have enough for the people who were in line.
1872580	1873580	Anyhow.
1873580	1874580	All right.
1874580	1876500	Uh, good reminiscing, good stories.
1876500	1877700	We got a little bit off topic though.
1877700	1881180	I want to get into our gaming weeks so we can get into what's going on in gaming news
1881180	1882180	this week.
1882180	1885260	Uh, so let's get into how was your gaming week, the types of video games that you have
1885260	1889700	been playing this week, whatever system it's on, uh, or PC, uh, dark Sakura.
1889700	1893020	I played some final fantasy, uh, 14.
1893020	1901140	Um, I thought about eight and then I went, lol, no, um, we, uh, what else did I play?
1901140	1906340	I actually started playing Mass Effect 2 again, just because I wanted more stuff to caption.
1906340	1907980	Um, what is it?
1907980	1908980	Oh yeah.
1908980	1909980	Animal crossing.
1909980	1910980	I'm still playing Zelda.
1910980	1912860	I'm taking my sweet time with it.
1912980	1918260	Um, I, I think I'm five songs away from having a complete song list in animal crossing now.
1918260	1919260	Nice.
1919260	1920260	Yeah.
1920260	1924220	Um, we, uh, crap, what else was it that I played?
1924220	1925220	Oh yeah.
1925220	1927460	I tried to play bust to move universe again and it's just awful.
1927460	1928460	I tried to like it.
1928460	1930380	It's, it just was not good.
1930380	1933700	It's clearly the reason it was $14 brand new.
1933700	1935580	It's just hard to see.
1935580	1941220	And then, um, I, uh, yeah, I think that's about it.
1941220	1945660	I kept going back and, uh, checking the, uh, roster list for Namco High cause I'm really
1945660	1947300	looking forward to playing it.
1947300	1948300	All right.
1948300	1951620	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1951620	1954300	Um, this week I played more Grand Theft Auto.
1954300	1958900	Um, did a little bit more online on the 360.
1958900	1962420	Got my character up to, I think, level 20, which is weird.
1962420	1966700	See, it kind of sucks that they've nerfed everything cause it, it's taken me so much
1966700	1971260	longer to get up to like level 20 on the Xbox 360 than it has on PlayStation 3 where
1971260	1973260	I was playing it a lot more.
1973260	1977620	And like on PlayStation 3, I think I'm up to like 28 or 30 or something.
1977620	1984340	Um, so it's kind of hard to get them all high level, especially when I split my time between
1984340	1986380	two different versions of the game.
1986380	1988380	Um, let's see.
1988380	1993080	Other things I played, I played a little Minecraft, um, this week just when I didn't have any
1993080	1996580	internet, um, at work and stuff.
1996580	2002420	And it's as grindy and, I don't know, as it's been, so.
2002420	2005980	But there's horses and, uh, I haven't really done anything with the horses.
2005980	2008340	They just taunt me from outside the window.
2008340	2015060	Um, and then I did, uh, as I was, uh, kind of hyping up last week, I did get to play
2015060	2021440	some of the, um, final beta tests for Just Cause 2 multiplayer.
2021440	2022440	It's fantastic.
2022440	2027120	I mean, the game is pretty old, but, um, I was gonna say, we're on Just Cause 3 at this
2027120	2028120	point, aren't we?
2028120	2029360	No, they haven't put out number three yet.
2029360	2030360	Oh, I thought we were.
2030360	2035040	No, that's, uh, hopefully gonna be worked on, but clearly it's a series I've overlooked
2035040	2036040	a bit.
2036040	2037040	Sorry.
2037040	2038040	Yeah, like Rent There's Auto.
2038040	2044080	Um, I would say though, it's pretty amazing what they've done with this game.
2044080	2048560	They, they have a game that was a single player game and they turned it into almost like an
2048560	2049560	MMO.
2050160	2055200	There were, there are literally hundreds of people online at a time.
2055200	2061400	Um, I think the lowest I saw it was about 800 people in one game on one server, 800
2061400	2062400	people.
2062400	2067200	And then the most was like 1400 people on one server, all playing together at the same
2067200	2068200	time.
2068200	2072760	Yeah, granted there was a few lag issues here and there, but it wasn't super terrible.
2072760	2078160	Um, the only thing it's like, I haven't played Just Cause 2 in a long time, so, you know,
2078160	2081340	the weapons are kind of limited and, you know, there's not a whole ton of vehicles,
2081340	2083760	but you can like buy your own weapons in game.
2083760	2088160	You kill people and you get money and you, or you can do races and get money that way.
2088160	2094080	Um, you know, you can jump to different places like teleport or you can, um, you know, join
2094080	2099080	races and you know, literally it'll just teleport you once you have enough people for a race
2099080	2104280	and you do the race and you earn money and you can buy vehicles, weapons, different player
2104280	2107920	skins and it's just, it's amazing what they've done.
2107920	2112920	And they even had at one point a thing, although it was disabled the last time I played this
2112920	2116200	afternoon, but they had a thing to boost your vehicle speed.
2116200	2121400	So you can type in, you know, slash boost and then set it from, you know, 0.5 or you
2121400	2123640	know, 1.0 boost up to 20.
2123640	2126400	And so if like you hit the gas and hit the boost, you can like launch.
2126400	2131080	I was flying in a, in a boat because I hit a wave or something like that and I was just
2131080	2135200	like, I went into the sky and it wasn't coming down.
2135200	2139440	But I mean, it's awesome because not only, you know, are you, you know, flying around
2139440	2144000	that stuff, but just cause you have like this grappling hook so you can, you know, grapple
2144000	2149080	onto things and planes and it's just fun and the game is super cheap.
2149080	2152840	So seriously, if they're launching the full version of the game later on this month, we'll
2152840	2156960	talk about that a little later, but the game itself is like two bucks.
2156960	2157960	It's like three bucks.
2157960	2160720	I think it's $2.99 on Steam.
2160720	2164480	Pick that game up and then definitely if you can pick up the multiplayer mod, hopefully
2164480	2167760	it's not going to be, I don't think it's gonna be that expensive, but you know, if
2167760	2172020	it's running pretty decent as it is with 1400 people with one server, when they open that
2172020	2175660	up and have a lot more servers, it's going to be pretty amazing.
2175660	2180560	So and I mean, I had, you know, the frame rate dropped a little bit when you have like
2180560	2184200	hundreds of people in one spot, but it wasn't too bad.
2184200	2185840	It was playable and it was a lot of fun.
2185840	2190000	I definitely gave me quite a big grin.
2190000	2191000	Neo Planet.
2191000	2192000	A lot of fun.
2192320	2196080	Since I can't kill anybody in Grand Theft Auto Online without being penalized for it,
2196080	2200600	which is kind of lame, but this game, kill, kill, kill, kill, you know, crash things into
2200600	2205080	each other and it's all sorts of chaos.
2205080	2207000	All right.
2207000	2213240	Uh, busy, busy with you then, uh, with, uh, Just Cause multiplayer and, uh, is there like
2213240	2218000	a, is there a faction or some way that all the VoG people can play with you or, um, well,
2218000	2222320	not right now because it's just a beta test, but you can create your own factions and join
2222320	2223400	up and stuff like that.
2223400	2227640	So that might be something we can do later on, especially because right now I would be
2227640	2232040	pretty hard to like stay together because it's a huge map and you kind of spawn into
2232040	2233280	random locations.
2233280	2239120	You can teleport to different places, but you know, it could, it's very easy to lose
2239120	2240760	each other in that game.
2240760	2241760	It was funny though.
2241760	2246400	There was one guy like I had jumped onto his boat and he drove off and so I stayed on his
2246400	2249760	hood for a while and then he kind of followed me around for a while.
2249760	2253720	And then like, you know, later on I was playing through and I passed by him, you know, parachuting
2253720	2254720	and stuff.
2254720	2259280	So I don't know, it'll be fun once, uh, once they launch it officially.
2259280	2260280	All right.
2260280	2263320	Uh, Jason, do you have something you want to share this week?
2263320	2270040	I I'm sure this came up when it actually came out, but have we like actually talked about
2270040	2277640	the, uh, the Miiverse 3DS, uh, the, the, the DLC for lack of a better word for bonus games?
2277640	2278760	Not really in depth.
2278760	2279760	So go for it.
2279760	2285720	I actually, it occurred to me this week when I was like really drawing out my ability to
2285720	2286720	play those.
2286720	2292640	Um, it's actually, those games are insane amounts of fun, but the problem is like Street
2292640	2296160	Pass, they rely on you passing people to actually generate it.
2296160	2301240	Um, I may have mentioned on the show sometime before that I have a router at home that takes
2301240	2307680	advantage of Nintendo's remote Street Pass feature where somebody will, somebody's data,
2307680	2311720	Nintendo will save somebody's Mi data at a hotspot.
2311720	2316400	And then when you go to that hotspot, you get their Mi data, your Mi goes in place.
2316400	2320560	And so you can actually start to proliferate at least a little bit more in the community.
2320560	2325720	And they're supposed to be doing something like, uh, a Starbucks, a McDonald's in Europe
2325760	2330120	and a McDonald's in America at the same time, we'll swap data across regions, that kind
2330120	2331120	of stuff.
2331120	2335440	So I have a router that masquerades that and I get, you know, for, for Miiverse, I get,
2335440	2343160	uh, 10 Mi's in not even 10 minutes and it, it really makes those games shine.
2343160	2347080	And especially like Mi Force, just how in depth it really is.
2347080	2359160	Um, I always forget the name of the, the, uh, Ninja, um, I can, yeah, I can never remember
2359160	2363120	the fourth game, but just a rock, paper, scissors.
2363120	2364120	Yeah.
2364120	2366880	It's lit that, that is, I thought I would like that game the most, but it is literally
2366880	2370600	just a grind fest for, for troops, um, rock, paper, scissors.
2370600	2371600	Yeah, whatever.
2371640	2376320	Monster Manor, uh, uh, Flower, wow.
2376320	2377320	I'm forgetting all of these.
2377320	2378320	Aren't I?
2378320	2379320	The Flower.
2379320	2380320	Yeah.
2380320	2383120	The Warriors way with the rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors.
2383120	2384120	Thank you.
2384120	2385120	And then Mi Force.
2385120	2388080	The other three are insane amounts of fun and I did not expect them to be.
2388080	2392660	So I have actually been really nursing those games this week because it takes me like two
2392660	2396880	to three weeks in San Francisco to be able to pick up 10 Mi's, which kind of surprises
2396880	2397880	me.
2397880	2398880	Um.
2398880	2399880	Tiger Claw is very curious.
2399880	2400880	How do you set up a router to do that?
2400880	2402560	Does it have to be a specific brand or model?
2402560	2408160	It does because you have to be able to change the router's Mac address.
2408160	2416660	Um, because that's the, uh, the 3DS has to communicate to the internet and Nintendo themselves
2416660	2420760	stores Mi data and a Mac address.
2420760	2425240	So the Mac address, uh, there's a, there's a community, basically a homebrew community
2425240	2426880	that revolves around this.
2426880	2431920	Um, I can send you a ton of links, um, and I will do that shortly.
2431920	2436280	I think the router I bought was like 40 bucks and there's plenty of alternatives, uh, around
2436280	2437280	as well.
2437280	2442040	So as I predicted I was going to do this week, as far as having time to sit down and game,
2442040	2443200	that did not happen.
2443200	2448240	I was training a new hire this week, which means my time was, you know, split between
2448240	2451160	my own daily duties as well as getting him up to speed.
2451160	2456560	And then all the fun things of dinner at work and all that kind of stuff, which meant that
2456560	2460840	I got back to the place that I'm staying at like 11 o'clock or midnight every single
2460840	2461840	night.
2461840	2462840	But you've been working on something for a while.
2462840	2467640	I have in the time that I did manage to have and then finished off on Saturday because
2467640	2469440	everything lightened up yesterday.
2469440	2475460	I actually sat down and at, um, I want to say it was dark touch Tetsuya's suggestion,
2475460	2477800	but I don't recall who actually said it last week.
2477800	2483480	Somebody said in chat that it's great that we're putting this on YouTube as well, but
2483480	2488040	can you take some advantage of visual content, ie classic game of the week?
2488040	2492840	I sat that I was like, that's a great idea and it's totally doable.
2492840	2497720	So I took the show, I took, uh, I got some of the resources from what Rob has done on
2497720	2499280	the previous episode.
2499280	2502800	And I, I wanted to do, I have a lot more ideas.
2502800	2504200	I just didn't have the time to do with this.
2504200	2505200	You're just dipping your big toe in.
2505200	2506200	So I was like, you know, okay.
2506200	2507200	Yay.
2507200	2508200	Yay.
2508200	2509200	You got the classic game.
2509200	2510200	Plus learning video editing and everything else.
2510200	2511200	That's the first.
2511200	2515840	I took the video that Rob was playing in studio for marble madness while Jamie was talking
2515840	2516840	about it.
2516840	2522120	And I spliced it into the video stream after the fact based off the audio that was going
2522120	2528000	on, it was time consuming as all hell and frustrating at times, but I'm really, really
2528000	2529440	pleased with how it came out.
2529440	2533240	It's the only inner content of the video, but there is more in store.
2533240	2534240	All right.
2534240	2537560	Well, thank you for volunteering to take over the YouTube channel.
2537560	2538560	Essentially.
2538560	2539560	It's going to be great.
2539560	2542520	We've gotten a little, a little bit of feedback on YouTube, and I think people looking forward
2542520	2546400	to seeing, you know, what we can do there and who knows, you know, I know I've said
2546400	2550400	my piece about, I don't know if talking heads during the show is the most interesting thing
2550400	2551400	in the world.
2551400	2552880	I know I've said my piece on that, but who knows?
2552880	2558320	I might, I might be swayed in 2014 things are a Bruin, you know, and if we can't think
2558320	2564600	of anything, we can just always fill the rest of the video full of YTMD strobing, you know,
2564600	2567120	the whole works for me, works for me.
2567120	2572600	Bobby Black Wolf, our, uh, our, uh, guy that's on before us here at, uh, the voice keys network.
2572600	2574400	He says in chat, I'm a little jealous.
2574400	2576960	So LR gets all these people to do things for them.
2576960	2579560	Oh, Bobby.
2579560	2586480	I've if it's any consolation, it took me a decade to realize that I can contribute.
2586480	2587480	So now I am.
2587480	2588480	Well, thank you.
2588480	2589480	We appreciate it.
2589480	2590480	Really do.
2590480	2591480	All right.
2591480	2593640	Uh, anyhow, let's, uh, talk about my gaming week.
2593640	2596240	I actually don't have a whole lot to share with my gaming week.
2596240	2598280	Um, Oh gosh, what could I talk about?
2598280	2601480	Well, you know, I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14, like a true addict.
2601480	2605840	Uh, luckily I'm not the only podcaster addicted to this stuff just before tonight's show.
2605840	2609080	I was helping my buddy, uh, who's one of the hosts on Koopa club.
2609080	2610080	I was helping him.
2610080	2613360	Uh, Jonko was one of the hosts over there and I was helping him with some of the things
2613360	2616880	you have to do when you're level 50, uh, like the primal battles and so forth.
2616880	2620480	I will say this as far as Final Fantasy 14 goes, cause it's not in the show world tonight.
2620480	2627200	Uh, there was a new trailer for the patch, uh, the patch 2.1 that hits Monday after next.
2627200	2631160	Uh, there's a new trailer that was out this week for that 10 minute trailer cause it shows
2631160	2632880	like a little bit of all the stuff that's new.
2632880	2636960	There's a lot of, and it kind of needs it as much as I love Final Fantasy 14, the end
2636960	2638680	game content's pretty thin.
2638680	2640920	So they're really beefing that up with this new patch.
2640920	2641920	That's very exciting.
2641920	2643020	So happy to see it.
2643020	2644680	Did you finish your lightning quests?
2644680	2646720	No, I failed on that.
2646720	2648000	I accidentally did them.
2648000	2650960	I did the first one and I slacked off on the others.
2650960	2654260	So I actually have a few screens of what lightning looks like in game.
2654260	2658280	The good news is if you didn't do the lightning quest, they will be back in February when
2658280	2660520	lightning returns comes out in the US.
2660520	2664040	So there you'll, you'll get a second shot to do those and there'll probably be more
2664040	2666200	people that are new to the game and so forth at that point.
2666200	2669480	Uh, so I've been playing an awful lot of that randomly this week.
2669480	2672600	I'll talk about a random game I played this week.
2672600	2676440	Um, so you know how there was that WB bundle that was on sale a few weeks ago and I've
2676440	2677820	had the key in steam.
2677820	2681340	So I was like, the other night, you know, I had, I didn't want to play MMOs cause I'm
2681340	2682840	like, all right, I've hit my limit on MMOs.
2682840	2685940	I need to play something else to, to just, you know, cleanse the pallet a little bit
2685940	2687260	and do something else in games.
2687260	2693060	I played Batman Arkham Asylum, like I partied like it was what, 2009 or whenever that game
2693060	2694180	came out.
2694180	2699000	But uh, that's, it was neat because I, I, it was the first time I played it on PC versus
2699000	2703880	a console and it runs really nice on my PC with the really crisp graphics and I could
2703880	2705420	just use an Xbox 360 controller.
2705420	2707180	So it's just like playing on console.
2707180	2713060	And it was great to go back and experience that again and it's that game and, and um,
2713060	2716260	you know, Arkham city and I haven't played the new one yet, but I know those first two
2716260	2718540	at least are so well put together.
2718540	2721740	Like they're, they're, they do such justice to the Batman comics.
2721740	2725540	I think, I mean, I know not everybody may agree, but you know, if you're more of a fan
2725540	2728600	of like the animated series and the comics and all that, any of those games do it so
2728600	2729600	well.
2729600	2733160	And uh, Mark Hamill does a great joker of course in the, I know he wasn't in the most
2733160	2735020	recent one, but in the earlier ones.
2735020	2739900	I watched Dan play through the, the, the other two and they're great games.
2739900	2744820	I mean, yeah, especially though I love all the Catwoman stuff in, um, Arkham, in Arkham
2744820	2745820	city.
2745820	2746820	That's great.
2746820	2747820	Yeah.
2747820	2751200	So, uh, and yeah, I need to play, I also have Arkham city on steam, so I'll play that at
2751200	2754780	some point, but, uh, I want to get through Arkham asylum first, even though it might
2754780	2758540	take me a little while and you got to tear me away from Final Fantasy 14 to do so.
2758540	2761980	Um, and then I've just been slowly making progress in other games.
2761980	2765600	Uh, new Mario, new Zelda, I haven't been playing those as much as I was when I first
2765600	2769600	got them, but I don't, I mean, there's no games left to buy at this point.
2769600	2772820	So the good news is, you know, through the holidays, I'll be able to make progress on
2772820	2774020	some of these games I fell behind in.
2774020	2776220	I think that's what a lot of you have planned.
2776220	2777220	Eh?
2777220	2778220	All right.
2778220	2779220	Eh?
2779220	2780220	Eh?
2780220	2781220	Don't know.
2781220	2782220	All right.
2782220	2783220	Uh, housekeeping.
2783220	2787220	Uh, you of course can friend the show at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and you can follow
2787220	2788860	us on Twitter.
2788860	2789860	Don't friend our butts.
2790740	2793980	Twitter.com slash O L R. Some people aren't going to get that joke, dark saga.
2793980	2799020	She's, she's referencing an old ass joke here on O L R. Um, what else is it going to say?
2799020	2801140	Uh, we are on YouTube now as well.
2801140	2803700	Uh, youtube.com slash orange launch radio.
2803700	2806920	Thank you, Jason, very much for taking the time to put that all together.
2806920	2812300	Don't bust your ass being a perfectionist on that because that's killed me so many times,
2812300	2817700	but do it 99% and you're good.
2817700	2822580	In my defense I did because I didn't, the, the, the video played essentially three and
2822580	2829180	a half times and I know the second time was out of sync, but I'm going to fuck that up
2829180	2830180	so bad.
2830180	2831180	Jason.
2831180	2832180	So don't get used to that.
2832180	2833180	It'll happen.
2833180	2834180	All right.
2834180	2836700	Uh, but we're, we're dying for more youtube comments on what you guys would like to see
2836700	2838940	over there outside of cameras in the studio.
2838940	2840180	We know you all want that.
2840180	2841180	We'll see.
2841180	2849100	Um, let's see, uh, as far as the schedule for the show goes, I don't see us taking any
2849100	2850420	shows off between now.
2850420	2853680	I mean the way Christmas and new year's are this year, I think we're going to have shows
2853680	2858300	right on through the new year, a schedule subject to change though.
2858300	2859740	Loki will not be here next week though.
2859740	2862140	Unfortunately, at least we don't think he's going to be.
2862140	2864340	Loki would you like to tell listeners why you're not going to be here next week?
2864340	2868580	I'm not going to be here next week cause on Thursday I have to get my wisdom teeth out.
2868580	2869580	Good times.
2870260	2873540	We are dying for Loki videos on, on the,
2873540	2874540	I will try.
2874540	2875820	I'm not going to have anything to do.
2875820	2877840	So you know, I'm just going to be sitting at home.
2877840	2882180	So Nellie, uh, she, she said she's gone through it.
2882180	2885260	I think, Hey, I don't know if she's gone through it, but I think people have gone through it
2885260	2888500	and they say, when you get out of general anesthesia, you're just very tired.
2888500	2889500	So who knows?
2889500	2890740	I may be sleeping.
2890740	2892560	I was confused.
2892560	2895420	I was talking about my ex boyfriend with my mother.
2895420	2897900	Like I will never have anesthesia again after that.
2897900	2899340	What was I thinking?
2899340	2900340	I don't know.
2900340	2901340	Well, let's see.
2901340	2902900	We'll see what we talk, what I talk about.
2902900	2908780	But um, I told her that I think she should record me like, you know, David after Dennis
2908780	2909780	thing.
2909780	2910780	Oh, we could just totally do that.
2910780	2912260	I think you should play Grand Theft Auto while you're on the anesthesia.
2912260	2913260	I probably will do.
2913260	2915260	Oh, while I'm on the anesthesia.
2915260	2916260	Yeah.
2916260	2918860	That, that would be a hilarious view.
2918860	2921140	Playing Grand Theft Auto while I'm on anesthesia.
2921140	2922140	I'm asleep.
2922140	2923140	Nothing's happening.
2923140	2929100	I'm just going to let it play and just sit there for 15 minutes.
2929660	2930660	No.
2930660	2935020	Um, so yeah, I'm not looking forward to that cause I've never been put under and uh, never
2935020	2936420	had an IV.
2936420	2938940	All these firsts that I really don't want to have to do.
2938940	2943220	Brad, uh, our buddy from pod culture here at the boys and geeks network says, wuss,
2943220	2944220	get your butt to the show.
2944220	2945220	Been there, done that.
2945220	2947300	I had a hand sandwich two hours after mine were out.
2947300	2948300	No, exactly.
2948300	2949740	I, Hey, I'm totally with you.
2949740	2953620	You know, I, I, I'm like ready to go back to work the next day, but you know, my wife's
2953620	2955620	like, oh, wait, you're not gonna be able to eat anything.
2955620	2956620	You're not really going to have to work.
2956660	2960580	Dude, he said I could eat something right after, you know, my job becomes a numb because
2960580	2963660	they don't want you to bite through your, you know, cheek or something like that.
2963660	2968660	I just hope you don't run into the same thing that I did was that, well, the bottom holes
2968660	2973100	didn't fill up for three months and I looked like I'd been in a prize fight for the entire
2973100	2974100	time.
2974100	2975100	Cool.
2975100	2976100	Then I'm going to totally say I'm in a price fight.
2976100	2980540	I also couldn't talk for the, those three months because I was talking to you cause
2980540	2982540	you're moving me my jaw.
2982540	2985580	You know, I got to say, I think SSG 100 Matt is absolutely right in the chat room and I
2985620	2989260	believe his dad's a dentist if I remember right, he says wisdom teeth recovery is different
2989260	2990260	for each person.
2990260	2993500	I was able to eat fine a day or two after and yeah, I think it just depends on each
2993500	2994500	person.
2994500	2995500	Yeah.
2995500	2997860	So don't, don't neglect the saline wash thing they tell you about.
2997860	2998860	That's super important.
2998860	3001540	Well, they're suturing them up, so I don't think it's going to be anything that I'm going
3001540	3004100	to need to, I didn't have to do a saline wash either.
3004100	3006860	I don't think I'm not going to be able to wash anything if it's sutured up.
3006860	3007860	Okay.
3007860	3011380	I seem to remember something about you have to do so that you don't want to get dry socket.
3011380	3012380	No.
3012380	3016540	So what I had to do was this, um, actually they gave me like a natural treatment to strengthen
3016540	3020140	the gums and then I didn't have to do any type of rinses or anything afterwards, but
3020140	3021140	I had my wisdom teeth out.
3021140	3023180	I guess I went to the back alley, Dennis.
3023180	3026900	Well, I had mine out though in the two thousands, you know?
3026900	3031500	Well, you know, my wife's like, you know, you can't eat anything afterwards cause what
3031500	3032980	if you get like something in there?
3032980	3034260	I'm like, that's okay.
3034260	3035260	If I eat meat.
3035260	3036260	You can have a milkshake.
3036260	3037780	If I, if I, well I'm going to have smoothies.
3037780	3042020	If I can, uh, you know, if I can just eat meat, I'll just shove meat in there cause you know,
3042020	3043020	flesh and flesh.
3043020	3044020	It works.
3044020	3045020	Have a meat milkshake.
3045020	3046020	A meat shake.
3046020	3047780	That's not as good as you think it is.
3047780	3050260	Does your meat shake bring all the boys to the yard?
3050260	3052660	Uh, does Jack in the box still do the bacon milkshake?
3052660	3053660	You could do that.
3053660	3054660	Oh God.
3054660	3055660	That was just, that wasn't very good.
3055660	3056660	That was pretty disgusting.
3056660	3057660	It just seems like smokey vanilla.
3057660	3060440	I agree with, I agree with Akuma JP, OLR, dentist edition.
3060440	3062420	We're going way too far down the dentist line.
3062420	3066020	Let's get into, uh, gaming news and what's going on in the video game world.
3066020	3068060	Even though it is the holidays, things are slowing down a little bit.
3068060	3070220	There's still some things to point out from the week.
3070220	3071220	Quite a bit actually.
3071220	3072220	Sorry, Scott.
3072220	3076700	I'm trying, I'm actually going to be on laughing gas is going to be actually, uh, I'm pretty
3076700	3078820	sure it's an Ivy.
3078820	3080220	That's too bad cause I think it would be hilarious.
3080220	3081780	I was on both.
3081780	3086740	I don't think they're going to put me on both cause they did give me a, was it a, they needed
3086740	3088380	both to knock out your soul.
3088380	3089380	Dark soccer.
3089380	3096100	The whole, the whole reason, you know what, this is true, but the whole, the whole reason
3096100	3099180	is because, um, it actually dilates your blood vessels.
3099180	3101900	They gave me something, they couldn't get the IV in.
3101900	3105100	They gave me something to take the edge off before I go there.
3105100	3106100	I don't remember what it is.
3106100	3112180	So some sort of drug that could you take the edge off the show by doing some gaming news?
3112180	3115140	So Sony has reset some PlayStation network passwords.
3115140	3121460	Um, they said that there was some irregular activity and apparently, you know, they, they
3121460	3126460	came out, try not to, you know, alarm anyone, you know, re routinely monitor for a regular
3126460	3131860	activity and if such activity is detected, we may sometimes reset passwords of affected
3131860	3136660	SCN accounts to protect consumers and their account information.
3136660	3142260	The password resets are not related to an attack nor vulnerability in our data servers.
3142260	3146660	It is an example of an increasingly common threat of malicious online activity.
3146660	3151660	Although I'd like to follow that up with, didn't I just read not too long ago that there
3151660	3156540	was some people being affected by the same type of shit that we saw with, you know, the
3156540	3161900	FIFA hacking now on the PlayStation 4 and maybe it's something to do with that.
3161900	3165460	But maybe I'm also, you know, being too conspiracy furious.
3165460	3172180	No, and I have some serious concerns about this story because when I turned on my PlayStation
3172180	3175460	3 earlier this week, it made me reset my password.
3175460	3177180	So I'm one of the people that had to do it.
3177180	3180380	And so there was a part of me that's like, why?
3180380	3182180	Why am I being picked?
3182180	3185740	Because there shouldn't be any irregularities on my account.
3185740	3190300	I only use my PlayStation 3 and the Vita once in a great while.
3190300	3192060	Why am I having to reset my password?
3192060	3196260	Which is, you know, it's kind of, I mean, changing your password is good and so forth,
3196260	3199020	but it's like, okay, now I really have to have unique passwords.
3199020	3201980	If it's in a constellation, they only hacked celebrities.
3201980	3202980	Okay.
3202980	3203980	Yeah.
3203980	3205820	But that's my problem is that I'm like, wait a minute.
3205820	3210660	Does that mean I was one of those people that they saw vulnerability for from the two
3210660	3212020	million other hack thing?
3212020	3213460	And I'm like, son of a bitch.
3213460	3214460	Like, am I at risk?
3214460	3216980	Like, it has me a little concerned.
3216980	3224460	So this is actually on the heels of a similar tech story about three or four weeks ago.
3224460	3228780	The chief one was the start of September with the big Adobe hack.
3228780	3234980	There were between that and then there are other miscellaneous news about, not that Twitter
3234980	3241060	and Facebook were hacked, but I saw something from them earlier this week.
3241060	3247180	LinkedIn and Adobe's password theft were like the big ones a couple months ago.
3247180	3251980	And this trend that's emerged from these really prominent companies is that they will get
3251980	3253900	that exported data.
3253900	3260100	And if your password, if your email address shows up, they'll warn you if your password
3260100	3264500	matches the same password hash, because any company in their right mind does not store
3265020	3266020	plain text passwords.
3266020	3267020	Unfortunately, some do.
3267020	3268020	These don't.
3268020	3273340	If your password matches a leaked hash, they reset your password because they force you
3273340	3274340	to.
3274340	3279180	You might've hit the nail on the head because I, I use unique passwords everywhere.
3279180	3280740	But you probably use the same email address.
3280740	3283660	But I use the same email address as PlayStation network.
3283660	3286460	I had an Adobe account on there.
3286460	3287800	That could be it.
3287800	3288800	You might be right.
3288800	3293620	And I feel a little better knowing that even, even with, even with hash passwords that I
3293620	3297340	could, to the extent that I actually have this knowledge, I could delve into the quick,
3297340	3300020	the quick overview is that remember, I'm a corporate trainer.
3300020	3301020	There's Adobe.
3301020	3302020	There's an Adobe stuff.
3302020	3303020	Here's the thing.
3303020	3306900	Then why didn't they just say, Hey, we saw that, you know, Adobe has been hacked near
3306900	3308140	these people have been hacked.
3308140	3312620	We ran a list, you know, comparing, you know, the emails that were affected, um, from those
3312620	3313620	sites.
3313620	3315900	And as a precautionary measure, we went ahead and reset the passwords.
3315900	3317700	I think of it a little bit more explanation.
3317700	3322340	If that's the case, that would, it would actually be better in their favor because they would
3322340	3324860	be, Oh, they're very proactive about that.
3324860	3327940	Code man in chat says I had to reset my PSN password too.
3327940	3329960	I bet code man's an Adobe user.
3329960	3330960	He does all that.
3330960	3333720	I know he does stuff with video and graphic design.
3333720	3334720	That's weird.
3334720	3336780	I'm an Adobe user too, but I didn't have to reset my password.
3336780	3339900	Oh, that's because I don't, well, I never got it.
3339900	3341820	Did you use different emails though?
3341820	3344700	I don't know if I give them, did you subscribe to their live services?
3344700	3345700	You probably didn't.
3345700	3346700	Yeah.
3346700	3348580	See, that's, I never got anything to reset my Adobe passwords though.
3348580	3353300	Did you ever use like, um, I, the name escapes me all of a sudden of the screencast or whatever
3353300	3359220	it is that they use or just any of their online services, acrobat online or I've got the creative
3359220	3364900	cloud because we was given the account for creative cloud for a year.
3364900	3367540	See Allen chat room says tinfoil hat radio.
3367540	3369420	I'm looking for a trend.
3369420	3370420	Okay.
3370420	3373180	Shane Alinko says I don't use Adobe, but I had to reset mine.
3373180	3374180	All right.
3374180	3375180	So y'all just blew a hole in my theory.
3375180	3376180	Do you use LinkedIn?
3376180	3377180	Oh yeah.
3377180	3378180	Oh yeah.
3378780	3380420	Maybe, maybe he did though.
3380420	3381420	Hmm.
3381420	3382420	No.
3382420	3384180	If Shane uses LinkedIn, then he's not on my profile.
3384180	3388140	I usually know why he's not my friend on LinkedIn with my work email.
3388140	3394340	So I don't ever, there's, there are many different sources of these things happening.
3394340	3400100	And even when the, the, the, the extracted information and breach is released, sometimes
3400100	3407420	it's not all of the information again, if, if, if they just go off password hashes, which
3407420	3412740	are not necessarily a perfect way of doing things, but if data doesn't match, your record
3412740	3413740	doesn't show up.
3413740	3414740	You don't have to change it.
3414740	3416260	There is no one answer for everything.
3416260	3421060	This is the continuing saga of security exploits vulnerabilities.
3421060	3422060	It happens.
3422060	3423640	It continues on whatever it happened.
3423640	3427060	As long as you take your precautions to stay safe, we don't have a problem here.
3427060	3431820	Use distinct passwords, enable two factor authentication if the service supports it,
3431820	3432820	be safe out there.
3432820	3434380	It sucks sometimes.
3434380	3435380	And then it's awesome.
3435380	3436380	Like this show.
3436380	3437380	Uh, yeah.
3437380	3438380	That's okay.
3438380	3440580	We're talking about drugs and chat.
3440580	3445700	Uh, also I don't, I don't want to, I want to really kind of just make sure I poke something
3445700	3446900	with a sharp stick here.
3446900	3450580	What Loki said about the whole FIFA hacks happening again on Sony, I just want to make
3450580	3455300	sure I call that out because that's a great concern to me.
3455300	3459420	And now I seem to remember when this, now my memory could be going here.
3459420	3465380	I seem to remember EA through this on Microsoft big time when that happened, EA pushback and
3465380	3469180	in land of Microsoft and I was one of those people that got hacked on Microsoft and so
3469180	3470180	forth.
3470180	3471180	And I said, you know what?
3471180	3472460	No, there's a connection here.
3472460	3476100	They created an EA account for me to buy all these.
3476100	3481140	There's something going on on EA side that they're not fessing up to.
3481140	3486020	And if this is, if this happened again, now it's through Sony.
3486020	3489460	I think EA, you got some explaining to do.
3489460	3493340	Didn't we, this, my, my brain could just be linking this in a strange way, but didn't
3493340	3498900	we basically narrow it down to, uh, that kind of stuff happening because of Amazon's
3498900	3505820	lax customer support, like, like Amazon, reverse social engineering on Microsoft, not Amazon,
3505820	3510380	and like using, using other profile details, uh, other credit card information or an email
3510380	3511380	address destination.
3511380	3514580	They're like, my, my brain has like seven companies in mind.
3514580	3517980	It's trying to remember the loop of the details and it's been a long time.
3517980	3519700	I think it's an explanation.
3519700	3523240	I'm not totally convinced it's the right one, especially now that we have this other thing
3523240	3524240	going on here.
3524240	3530960	And I kind of need EA to be very clear here on why it's not them and some, some very specific
3530960	3533800	about what they're doing with data and how they're keeping it safe.
3533800	3537440	I'm just saying that as a consumer, I mean, you might be a tech person sitting there going,
3537440	3541480	Rob, there's no way that I just, as a consumer right now, I don't trust that this isn't happening
3541480	3544200	because of something on EA side.
3544200	3549640	I mean, it's, it's just too weird of a coincidence that it happened on Microsoft through an EA
3549640	3554200	game and now it's happening through Sony on an EA game.
3554200	3558960	That's that Scott of Tron and chat says, yeah, like EA would fess up to anything.
3558960	3564160	Well, then we'll have to see how much we want to support them and give them information
3564160	3566360	and money further on.
3566360	3571320	But anyhow, here's something, uh, that I'm sure a lot of you will be spending money on.
3571320	3575920	It was something that was announced during the, uh, VGX, uh, award show.
3575920	3580040	One of the, one of the few highlights out of the show, uh, telltale announced that they
3580040	3584020	are working on a game tales from the borderlands.
3584020	3589040	So of course telltale did the, the speaking of video game award shows, they, they won
3589040	3591240	them all for walking dead last year.
3591240	3593080	Now tons of people want to work with them.
3593080	3596840	So gearbox software, one of the people is working with telltale on this.
3596840	3598680	So it's a game in the borderlands universe.
3598680	3600440	It will be an episodic series.
3600440	3602760	The storyline is defined by player choices.
3602760	3608200	Um, gearbox will be providing borderlands assets telltale, however, is the ones that
3608200	3610720	are, uh, designing the game.
3610720	3613320	Telltale did make new characters for this game.
3613320	3619320	They are saying they are not quite vault hunters, uh, and some of the characters seen in it,
3619320	3624400	possibly handsome Jack, uh, although it's more of a resemblance in the trailer, part
3624400	3627200	of me kind of wonders, could it be like a prequel or something?
3627200	3632360	I think it's supposed to be during the same time as borderlands two or before.
3632360	3633360	So we'll see.
3633360	3635400	Uh, that wasn't the only thing telltale had to announce.
3635400	3639280	They, uh, announced quite a bit because they also announced that they're working on a game
3639280	3640760	of thrones game.
3640760	3646440	Uh, so yeah, and I think isn't, do we already have some, they already kind of, that came
3646440	3651240	out I think last week or earlier this week, but they did say it's based on the HBO series,
3651240	3652240	not the books.
3652240	3653240	Um, cool.
3653240	3656280	So that's, you know, cause I think they've kind of gone different directions at this
3656280	3657280	point.
3657280	3660200	So it will be based off the HBO series and it is now official.
3660200	3661680	So, uh, there you go.
3661680	3664400	So a telltale clearly very busy.
3664400	3668340	Uh, one thing I noticed that there wasn't a lot that people have been talking about
3668340	3669340	this year.
3669340	3672560	Telltale kind of didn't have a lot this year, although chat pointed out to me before the
3672560	3677440	show, um, the, the wolves among us or something was a game that came out this year, but that
3677440	3681660	didn't, that didn't get quite the chatter that some of their other releases have.
3681660	3687320	So, um, you know, I'm wondering if there will be more in 2014, although I think walking
3687320	3691360	dead episode or season two is supposed to be like really soon.
3691360	3695000	Uh, some are saying it might be later this month, although it seems like a really weird
3695000	3699360	time to release next year, probably early next year, but you never know.
3699360	3702740	I mean, you know, telltale could recognize that they do a bulk of their business through
3702740	3706080	digital distribution and they could release whenever.
3706080	3709480	And you know, what a great thing to pick up on these gaming consoles right away.
3709480	3710480	Who knows?
3710480	3711480	Who knows?
3711480	3712480	So, all right.
3712480	3714120	Uh, moving on dark soccer.
3714720	3720200	Well, you know, we've had a lot of, uh, joy over a particular gaming franchise and that's
3720200	3721200	Tomb Raider.
3721200	3725080	Well, the definitive edition is coming out for PS4 and Xbone.
3725080	3726560	I mean, Xbox one.
3726560	3734940	Um, it's supposed to be out on January 28th in the US and in Europe on January 31st.
3734940	3736680	And it was announced on the games Tumblr.
3736680	3739560	I'm glad to see Tumblr getting more love.
3739600	3746120	So you get all of the pre-order, um, bonuses, the, the Tomb of the Lost Adventurer and the
3746120	3752040	multiplayer add-ons, uh, eight DLC maps, uh, six weapons and four characters.
3752040	3757840	You also get extra Lara outfits and, um, digital copies of the, uh, Tomb Raider, the beginning
3757840	3760200	and the art, the art book.
3760200	3761760	So lots of stuff.
3761760	3764880	Also the final hours of Tomb Raider will be included as well.
3764880	3770080	The Xbox one version will have, uh, connect voice controls for weapon modding and menus.
3770080	3772240	Um, and that's, I don't care.
3772240	3776480	So there's, there's a part of me that wants to razz this a little bit because it's like,
3776480	3779840	so we're, so we're remaking a game that just came out last year.
3779840	3783400	But then I think, all right, well, but at the same time, at least they gave you everything
3783400	3786080	and didn't just move the game and have you rebuy everything.
3786080	3787080	Yeah.
3787080	3791760	Well, and the other thing is too that the, you know, it's not uncommon for big games
3791760	3795960	to get a like game of the year edition that includes everything.
3795960	3801280	That's kind of what this is, but yet they, they, they turned it up for these new consoles,
3801280	3802680	which I find, it's just interesting.
3802680	3806840	We haven't, I haven't really seen something like this that I can think of before, you
3806840	3810280	know, outside maybe Nintendo remaking some of the Wii games.
3810280	3812120	That's, that's just not even the same thing.
3812120	3817520	You know, I like the sentence in the article on PS4, your controller will light up when
3817520	3819640	using the torch.
3819640	3820640	It's cute.
3820640	3824280	I'm assuming they'll also use the backlight, the eye light as well.
3824280	3826840	But the controller is already lit up all the time.
3826840	3828960	So am I using the torch all the time?
3828960	3829960	Perhaps.
3829960	3832120	It's gonna change colors.
3832120	3836360	The big thing about that for me personally though, is that given that I've played it
3836360	3845200	on PC and just all of the just graphical glory that it produced, as well as being solid gameplay
3845200	3849680	wise, I think it would be a nice treat for people at home to be able to play it up to
3849720	3850720	that level too.
3850720	3851720	Yeah.
3851720	3854960	And I gotta be honest, as much as I'm saying like, you know, Oh, this is interesting.
3854960	3859440	You know, I, I do still kind of want to, I actually really want to get it because I thought
3859440	3864800	the game was gorgeous as it was on, you know, even 360 and now they're talking about, Oh,
3864800	3867440	we're going to turn it, turn up the graphics even more.
3867440	3872880	I'm kind of like, Ooh, I kind of want to check that out for me price.
3872880	3876960	Do I want to drop $60 on it again?
3876960	3881480	You want to check it out with better graphics played on PC.
3881480	3886720	But to, to be fair, they, I mean, it's, it's different to be like better graphics from
3886720	3891760	what they've got or they are going back and actually upping some of the assets and so
3891760	3892760	far.
3892760	3895920	I mean, they're, they're, this isn't just repackaging it.
3895920	3897920	I think it's playing it on the new console.
3897920	3903000	I think it's just putting the PC assets on your, more of the PC assets on the console.
3903000	3904920	I don't think they're going back and redoing anything.
3904920	3906960	That's not the, eh, that's not the impression I was getting.
3906960	3909400	Look, yeah, I think there's more to it than that because especially cause they talk about
3909400	3910400	like this stuff.
3910400	3911400	I know this.
3911400	3912400	All right.
3912400	3913400	Well I guess we'll find out in a month and a half.
3913400	3915640	But the stuff with the hair sounds very different.
3915640	3919440	So like that takes, you know, and they, they con they got these other studios to get involved
3919440	3920440	too.
3920440	3921440	Is that takes work.
3921440	3922440	There's stuff with her hair.
3922440	3923440	Yeah.
3923440	3924440	They, they changed something.
3924440	3928160	Their hair is more fluid, hairy.
3928160	3929160	It's more hair-like.
3929160	3930160	Really?
3930160	3934360	Cause I believe that was one of the PC things, if I remember correctly.
3934360	3940000	I do have to say that there was a difference in, as far as when I first loaded up the game
3940000	3944080	with the lower end and then bumped it up all the way, there were a little bit few differences
3944080	3950360	with hair mechanics, hair mechanics, remember the special thing, hair mechanics.
3950360	3951360	Yes.
3951360	3957640	I would believe that would be the Tomb Raider Tress FX hair, uh, which is an option on PC.
3957640	3962120	That's the enhanced hair, um, both, you know, the physics and stuff.
3962120	3966280	So that, yes, would be a PC thing.
3966280	3969920	So basically they're taking the PC assets and putting them on next gen, but hey, whatever,
3969920	3970920	that's fine.
3970920	3973120	You know what hair physics always make me think of?
3973120	3980480	Uh, Soul Edge and all, and the, the Tekken games when they started doing, you can see
3980480	3987080	that the strands of hair, I was like, but it doesn't look like real hair.
3987080	3989080	I have to say that Lara's hair looked like hair.
3989080	3990200	It was very hairy.
3990200	3992960	Well, I just thought, I just thought the game in general looked great.
3992960	3997580	So, you know, it already was starting to look, you know, like, I don't want to say it looked
3997580	4003200	like next gen, but it just, it looks like such a, it's a, it's a great example of what
4003200	4006280	the previous gen consoles were really capable of.
4006280	4011640	So I'm, I'm fairly certain cause you know, Dan's been seeing me play the game.
4011640	4015240	I've gone back and played it, you know, tried to get a little bit further cause I haven't
4015240	4019640	beaten it yet, but I did play it fairly consistently and I would love to see Dan play through that.
4019680	4021680	But I know he'd enjoy it.
4021680	4025200	Yeah, I'm sure, and you know, I'm sure there are some people that miss the boat the first
4025200	4026200	time around too.
4026200	4030320	I see in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Shane says, Shane Alinko says, this is good
4030320	4032400	for me as I didn't play the original release.
4032400	4034200	I'll definitely look into getting this.
4034200	4037320	So, but then there's a part of me that's like, how did you miss the original release when
4037320	4043360	the game was like on sale for a steal on some of the very steam sales and so forth?
4043400	4050400	I used my, uh, my steam wallet gift and got it, like I paid three bucks extra for it.
4050400	4052400	So there you go.
4052400	4053400	All right.
4053400	4055680	Uh, let's move on.
4055680	4056680	More news.
4056680	4057680	Loki.
4057680	4058680	All right.
4058680	4063800	Um, let's see, let's talk a little bit about, uh, the Xbox one.
4063800	4067880	Um, remember one of the things that they kind of talked about, I think it was a few months
4067880	4075000	ago, this whole, you know, being able to publish using your Xbox one as like a dev kit.
4075000	4078560	And actually some people figured out how to do that or at least get into the dev kit mode
4078560	4080840	and I've been dicking around with that.
4080840	4085840	But, um, for the actual devs, um, they've already, um, listed 33 developers that are
4085840	4094080	participating in their ID at, um, Xbox, uh, program, I guess if you want to call it, um,
4094080	4101240	including, uh, behavior, which, uh, I guess they did, uh, wet and naughty bear panic in
4101240	4102240	paradise.
4102240	4103240	What was a good game?
4103240	4104240	Naughty bear.
4104240	4112400	Not so much bong fish, uh, born ready, uh, Cappy, which is super time force, uh, concept
4112400	4120520	cry tech, uh, definition six, which did spy party, um, demerge the shoot many robots,
4120520	4126680	uh, double 11, little big planet Vita, double fine, uh, drink box, gaijin games, the bit
4126680	4134680	trip series, uh, half brick studios, fruit ninja, happy in labs, uh, hidden path, high
4134680	4139080	voltage software, which did the conduit, which man, they haven't released anything in a long
4139080	4140080	time.
4140080	4146560	Um, anise, you may remember them, elite beat agents, anyone, uh, iron galaxy, jackbox games,
4146560	4150760	um, Nicholas, which the cave story and VVVVVV.
4150760	4153640	I didn't know that same guy did both those games.
4153640	4154640	Pretty sweet.
4154640	4161760	Um, ninja B, other ocean, which, uh, the, uh, dark void zero and super monkey ball games
4161760	4169480	on iOS, uh, panic button, which unfortunately connects star Wars signal studios, uh, slightly
4169480	4175280	mad studios, team 17 behind the worm series, uh, team colorblind, uh, the men who wear
4175280	4182440	many hats, best name of development house ever, uh, the odd gentlemen, Vladimir, uh,
4182440	4186760	way forward, uh, Z boy games and Zen studios.
4186760	4193800	If I remember correctly, Nicholas, uh, did the 3d, it's either that they published VVVVVV
4193800	4200720	or that they brought it to DS or some other platform because that was Terry Cavanaugh.
4200720	4204800	And I'm maybe, yeah, maybe they published, they might've done the ports then.
4204800	4208160	Cause I know like these guys are doing ports of things and cave story did come out on multiple
4208160	4209160	platforms as well.
4209160	4210160	It's true.
4210160	4216120	Um, the other thing that can kind of go along with that though is, uh, some of the, um,
4216120	4224800	indie publishers are running into, uh, I guess some of their small print things in this part
4224800	4225800	of this program.
4225800	4231040	Uh, for example, not only do you get, you know, I guess the wonderful, like, um, you
4231040	4235440	get two console development kits, a unity license, and the ability to publish your games
4235440	4236440	by yourself.
4236440	4241840	Um, also they asked that, um, the games that launched same day on X-Box one and any other
4241840	4249280	console platforms, um, they say, um, they want launch parody rather than exclusivity.
4249280	4256520	And um, I guess one of these, so it, one of the developers that ran into this, um, was
4256520	4259280	it, uh, Vladimir, I, yeah, Vlambeer.
4259280	4265520	Um, they're saying that they, one of their games, a nuclear throne, I guess was supposed
4265520	4271680	to, they were talking with them about bringing it to the X-Box one.
4271680	4279160	And um, I guess they maybe wanted it to be exclusive, but somehow because of that, they're
4279160	4281600	actually going to publish it on PlayStation four.
4281600	4289040	Um, you know, they said, I guess, uh, it'll just come out on PlayStation four first, I
4289040	4294660	guess they're, they didn't have an X-Box one version available, but they wanted to
4294660	4297880	publish it on that platform later on.
4297880	4304280	Um, but because Microsoft basically restricting you, you must launch your game on the X-Box
4304280	4306560	one and then all the other platforms at the same time.
4306560	4307560	Oh, I see.
4307560	4311720	So, you know, they didn't want to hold up the other versions of the game for the, could
4311720	4313400	that be because of what happened with DuckTales?
4313400	4317320	Cause you know, DuckTales didn't come out on X-Box till way after the other versions.
4317320	4318560	And I think, I don't think it's that.
4318560	4322240	I think they just want to have, they don't want to be at a disadvantage as far as like
4322240	4324880	exclusive versions or something like that.
4324880	4329400	I maybe, maybe that's fine, but maybe they just don't want Sony to have like a window
4329400	4331120	on that stuff.
4331120	4334280	Microsoft wants to have the window, you know, on call of duty DLC and all that bullshit.
4334280	4335280	Sure.
4335280	4338360	Um, so maybe that's what the issue is.
4338360	4341880	I think though, maybe they can get around it by doing, you know, pulling them kind of
4341880	4348040	what Microsoft did with, you know, Minecraft, you know, have the Minecraft X-Box one version
4348040	4350360	and then Minecraft PlayStation four version.
4350360	4352840	Technically they're two different games, you know, and then they'd be able to publish it
4352840	4353840	later on or something.
4353840	4357200	Uh, Black Wolf says, he wants to try to explain this here.
4357200	4359620	The X-Box one wants parody, the loophole.
4359620	4363500	If you are already signed up for another platform, they don't have to wait.
4363500	4368400	So they said, quote, Oh, they want parody if I sign, Hey Sony, one a one month exclusive
4368400	4369400	quote.
4369400	4370400	Sure.
4370400	4371400	Uh, okay.
4371400	4372400	Hey, Hey Microsoft.
4372400	4373400	We want to sign up.
4373400	4374400	Oh, okay.
4374400	4375400	That's fine.
4376240	4378540	So interesting.
4378540	4385040	This is a, this is a great policy in theory for, you know, gamers consumers most of all,
4385040	4389840	because it means that no matter what platform you've backed, if your game is coming multi-console,
4389840	4394400	you will get it and you don't have to spoilers or any other consideration that you don't,
4394400	4396600	you don't have to wait on anybody else.
4396600	4401360	But if maybe in theory, because, you know, Bobby just pointed out, there's a way around
4401360	4402360	it.
4402360	4403360	Yeah.
4403360	4407640	As far as games that actually get released on multiple platforms at the same time, if
4407640	4414560	you do not budget your time, and this article basically talks that, um, that the development
4414560	4420720	shop, uh, that Vlambeer was caught off guard, but if you do not budget your time properly
4420720	4426400	or you just come across this, if you are bound to this, it's going to hurt your firm and
4426400	4430600	potentially your results and potentially the game because you weren't expecting to have
4430600	4437280	to put almost almost entirely, literally two times the work in for one release date.
4437280	4442400	I love this concept, but like anything else, it has a trade off that unfortunately gets
4442400	4444820	to be pretty nasty pretty quick.
4444820	4449600	If I were them, you know, I would just want the least amount of restrictions possible
4449600	4456680	for the developers because right now the perception is PlayStation four is very developer friendly
4456680	4457680	Xbox one.
4457680	4462360	I don't think they've quite gotten there yet where people are kind of recognized as a platform
4462360	4465080	that they can find their favorite indie games.
4465080	4468600	I would think they want the least amount of obstacles in between them and getting that
4468600	4472480	at least at the beginning, you know, hell, change your rules later on down the line if
4472480	4479280	you know, once you have a decent catalog of indie games, but, and I'm also kind of disappointed
4479280	4484440	that they kind of got rid of the whole, you know, it's kind of a twofold thing.
4484440	4489440	I'm kind of disappointed that they got rid of the whole community games and knew the
4489440	4492800	idea of, Oh, I can use my Xbox one to publish my own games and stuff.
4492800	4493800	That's really cool.
4493800	4498520	But I understand, you know, that there were a lot of crappy games on that, that service
4498520	4502040	at the same time though, it still would be nice to have that ability to put your own
4502040	4503040	games on there.
4503040	4507600	Maybe it was some sort of peer review or something like that to filter out, you know, those massage
4507600	4508600	simulators.
4508600	4509960	Let's clear out the chaff.
4509960	4510960	Yeah.
4510960	4516320	To register participation for this week's episode of orange laundry radio at vog network.com
4516320	4518800	use the passphrase sailboat.
4518800	4521920	Well let's move on with more information about the Xbox one, cause there's a really weird
4521920	4526120	rumor going on out there and it's just, it's one of those things I think it's kind of trolling
4526120	4531660	people who can't or who don't understand technology or I don't know, because there's this weird
4531660	4535240	picture going around out there and I'm not going to repeat the description here cause
4535240	4539360	I don't want to perpetuate a rumor that could potentially damage people's consoles, but
4539360	4543720	it's the equivalent of basically telling people, Hey, if you put up, up, down, down, left,
4543720	4549320	right, left, right, BA star into your Xbox one, you will be able to play Xbox 360 games.
4549320	4554160	And there's people, and I don't want to say that they're dumb enough to believe it, but
4554160	4558940	they're not educated enough on how these systems really work that they actually kind of believe
4558940	4562240	it because they use the magic words that, Oh, you're going to, you're going to get into
4562240	4568660	dev console mode on your Xbox one and it'll unlock the ability to play Xbox 360 games.
4568660	4575360	So let's review. The reason why Xbox 360 games are not playable on the Xbox one is
4575360	4580620	because the chips inside have changed completely. They are different manufacturers now. Correct
4580620	4585860	Loki? Yeah, it's different architecture altogether. And actually you see that surprise and it
4585860	4592020	came from 4chan. Um, and basically it's someone stumbled upon the way to get into developer
4592020	4595820	mode and Microsoft said, Hey, don't try to get into developer mode cause it will break
4595820	4601520	your console because it's two parts. Microsoft that's basically, you know, give you the access
4601520	4606140	to this and then you also have to enable it on your console in order to actually switch
4606140	4611120	it over to kind of like developer mode. If you don't do it without their access, it causes
4611120	4615100	all sorts of different problems with it. So if you, if you follow the rules, what you're
4615100	4619020	doing, you're not, you're not unlocking anything. You're causing your Xbox one to basically
4619020	4625060	do like an infinite loop booting. So it's just, it's just some troll thing from 4chan.
4625100	4630020	So, you know, just to be clear, don't get, don't, if you read something that's too good
4630020	4634660	to be true, it probably is. This is the second time in three months, something like this
4634660	4639140	has happened. Oh, what was the other one? The first one? IOS seven makes your device
4639140	4645260	waterproof. Wait, that was a thing? That was a thing? I kid you. I didn't even hear that.
4645260	4650660	If you go to Twitter search and you type in IOS waterproof, the top tweet minus the fucking
4650660	4656580	LG ad, whatever. Uh, if you go that, if you do that in a, in Twitter search, I actually
4656580	4660420	did this just to kind of make sure I wasn't crazy. And sure enough, the very first tweet
4660420	4665060	in the search results 4chan convinced people that IOS seven makes their iPhones waterproof.
4665060	4670540	Now they've convinced people to break their Xbox ones with backwards compatibility. Uh,
4670540	4675060	IOS seven came out, uh, uh, mid September, early September, three months later. Look
4675060	4678480	at this all over again. I think it's, you know, just a lesson that if something is too
4678480	4684960	good to be true, it is very, I don't know. It's just interesting to me that, you know,
4684960	4688100	there's always, there's always been smoke and mirrors and uh, there's a better, there's
4688100	4692960	a better terminology for this. Uh, there's always been snake oil salesman, but this is
4692960	4696840	like, this is the, these are the internet snake oil sales common sense. But if they
4696840	4700680	had the ability to play backwards, they're have full backwards compatibility. They would
4700680	4705980	be totally pimping that shit out if not trying to sell it, you know, as a DLC or something.
4705980	4709060	But they would be pimping that show. Hey, we have backwards compatibility. Those guys
4709060	4715500	don't. I mean, why would you lock that away? Yeah, it's a silly anyway. All right. Uh,
4715500	4721620	let's move on to less silly things. How about something that's a lot kinder? Um, well, uh,
4721620	4725660	there's actually an article talking about the humble bundle and one of the charities
4725660	4729220	that they've helped out. They've actually been, um, working to bring clean drinking
4729220	4735580	water to Ethiopia, which I think is definitely something positive that we need to be focusing
4735580	4742380	on instead of people being assholes. Um, so basically, um, they worked with a particular
4742380	4747940	charity that used a hundred percent of the donations to bring clean water. And so now
4747940	4757220	they have, uh, 3,275 people in Ethiopia that are going to have a clean water. And the total
4757220	4765460	amount was, uh, it came up to $121,780. So that's pretty good news. See, we're not all
4765460	4769380	assholes. I like to hear the gamers doing good stories and it plus it's kind of nice
4769380	4773340	to see too. We always kind of like, I think a lot of us when we're buying these humble
4773340	4776900	bundles and so forth, we just kind of click the button and it's like, Oh yay, some of
4776900	4781900	my money's going to good pat myself on the back. We don't really see it past that. So
4781900	4785940	I'm glad there's information out there like this to really kind of show like here is how
4785940	4789740	the money is really helping. You know what I mean? And I think it's good that they're
4789740	4796300	being so transparent with how that money is being allocated to and giving us the option.
4796300	4800740	And you know, it's, it's sort of like, Hey, you know, you do something good for somebody
4800740	4805900	else. We'll do something good for you here. Have some fun. You know, I've always been
4805900	4810220	a big advocate of the charities like that, especially, uh, you know, even though I'm
4810220	4815100	not too fond of Penny Arcade themselves, I've been happy with Child's Play and with a lot
4815100	4821780	of those, um, charities that basically turns our love of games into almost love for other
4821780	4827300	people. Right. You know. All right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some
4827300	4831140	release dates. And I know this might be a short segment tonight, but we check in every
4831140	4835300	week on what games are coming out in a video game store near you, starting with the U S
4835300	4839060	Loki. Uh, the only thing coming out this week is Sorcery Saga Curse of the Great Curry
4839060	4845940	God on PlayStation Vita. Um, actually, if I remember correctly, there's Dreamfall, uh,
4845940	4850820	ventures or chronic, I think it's Dreamfall adventures. That's coming out on Xbox three
4850820	4854460	six. It's been delayed forever. Maybe it's being delayed again, but, uh, that was supposed
4854460	4860820	to be coming out. And then guess what? That's it for the entire year. I figured as much.
4860820	4865980	All right. Well in Japan, uh, things are moving a little bit differently because, uh, obviously
4865980	4869920	the holidays are a little bit different over there. So, you know, uh, you can pre-order
4869920	4873700	one of these games to go with your Christmas cake if you like. Uh, but on the PlayStation
4873700	4878820	three this week on December 12th in Japan, um, some game of the year additions, dishonored,
4878820	4883860	uh, crisis three going into best hits, uh, call of duty ghost gets a dubbed version,
4883860	4888700	uh, released this week. As far as new games go, there's a new PlayStation three console
4888700	4893580	bundle with puppeteer. That's out this week. And, uh, Jinsei ego to next generation and
4893580	4899620	Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou comes out this week from Koei. So that's what you can look forward
4899620	4904780	to this week on December 12th, as far as PlayStation three goes, let me check out three 60. Um,
4904780	4908860	the same call of duty ghost dubbed version is out there as well as dishonored the game
4908860	4914340	of the year edition. That's pretty much it for the three 60, um, going to the PlayStation
4914340	4921020	Vita Hatsune Miku project diva gets a price reduction. Uh, Vita's region free, right?
4921020	4925140	This might be your time to pick it up. So you folks here in the U S if you want your
4925140	4929980	a version of Hatsune Miku for the Vita, this might be a good time to pick it up. Uh, on
4929980	4935900	the Wii U, uh, the balance board USB adapter comes out this week, uh, which I imagine is
4935900	4940140	for Wii fit you, but I don't know exactly what that the balance board USB adapter, are
4940140	4943740	they going to let you start plugging that into computers and stuff? I didn't even know
4943740	4947260	that was a thing. Um, well, you know what? It's not coming out from Nintendo. It's a
4947260	4951940	third party, so it must be some type of battery pack. I'm guessing. Oh yeah. Maybe it's some
4951940	4956100	weird kind of thing. All right. Well that's there, but you can also get monster hunter
4956100	4961380	front frontier G and a beginner's package that's out from Capcom this week on the Wii
4961380	4968500	U. Uh, lastly, but not leastly on the Nintendo 3DS, uh, hometown story, Kira, Maki, waku
4968500	4975260	waku suite, uh, Kobito, Zukin, Kobito, no Fushigi, G, can set comes out this week, puzzle
4975300	4985100	and dragons Z. Is that the same as the cell phone game? I bet it is. Yeah. Yeah, I think
4985100	4989820	it is. Yeah. Same as the cell phone game is getting like a, uh, spruced up 3DS version
4989820	4995540	in Japan this week. Um, also, uh, and probably most importantly this week in Japan on the
4995540	5004180	Nintendo 3DS, hello kitty to Maho no apron rhythm cooking comes out this week. That's
5004180	5009700	right. You can cook. It's, it's cooking mama meets a rhythm game meets hello kitty. I should
5009700	5014300	not go back to the name real quick. I shit you not. I want this game kind of bad. Actually.
5014300	5020580	Go back to the name real quick. There you go. I'm not there. Uh, come on. Close right
5020580	5026940	there. Hello kitty with the magic apron. It's a rhythm cooking game starring hello kitty
5026940	5033020	and a magic apron. Why can't I have this? I want this. Give it to me. You're not worthy.
5033020	5039300	Why is the 3DS not region free? Because it'll come out over here. Bad bats. Maru is making
5039300	5044980	a state. God damn it. This is amazing. While I would like to point out the project diva
5044980	5048900	F is being localized and will be eventually released in North America. Some people can't
5048900	5054040	wait while I are. Yeah. Well, uh, all those DDR games and 2d X games and whatnot that
5054040	5059780	we have language writing and telling the wrong show, telling her my Japanese PlayStation
5059780	5068620	2 says hello. All right. And soon my Japanese 3DS. All right. Uh, let's go to the UK. Dark
5068620	5073940	Sakura. Well, there's, we actually have a good number more in the UK than we did over
5073940	5081740	here. Um, on the 10th is the novelist for Mac and PC. On the 11th is Angry Birds Go.
5081740	5087500	The 12th is, um, velocity ultra for PC. And on the 13th is stick it to the man and we
5087500	5095480	fit you. Stick it to the man. That's the best name ever. I didn't name my firstborn
5095480	5101500	stick it to the man. Just a few more stories for you guys than the classic game of the
5101500	5105660	week. Uh, Y Y R in chat, by the way, saying you waited this long. The game's been out
5105660	5112700	over six months. That's true because, uh, the, um, that's true because the version that's
5112700	5116360	coming out in Japan this week is like a best hits type of thing. It's a price reduction
5116360	5121200	and Y Y R saying you could get the PlayStation 3 version right now. You know what? I do need
5121200	5124680	to get that game because I said I would buy it when it comes down in price and I think
5124680	5129280	it finally did. So I want to get Hatsune Miku, uh, here. All right. Anyway, back to some
5129280	5133280	news before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki. So like we talked about last
5133280	5139700	week with Forza 5 and their microtransactions, um, Gran Turismo 6 also had microtransactions
5139700	5144680	and Sony of course claims that they are not required for players to advance in the game,
5144680	5150840	but you might say the same about the Forza 5 ones. Um, honestly haven't seen how I've
5150840	5155800	seen far less people complaining about these and the Forza ones, but I'm not really sure
5155800	5160960	why considering they're both sound the same to me. I guess it's how it's presented. Um,
5160960	5164980	they're saying as with previous installments of Gran Turismo, users are able to earn in
5164980	5170920	game credits and unlock cars by competing in races. And, uh, if you want to buy credits,
5170920	5176360	they are in increments of 500 or half a million on the PlayStation network to speed up the
5176360	5184160	process of unlocking content. So I don't know. It sucks that there's microtransactions in
5184160	5189600	both games, but like I said, I haven't played either one, so I don't know how they're presented,
5189600	5197760	but that still sucks. Well, the impression that I'm getting from what I'm hearing about
5197760	5201960	it is that it's, it's really not like something they're trying to shove down your face or
5201960	5206120	anything. Like it's not, it's not like the stigma that a lot of free to play games have
5206120	5209520	where they're like pay to win and so forth. That's not really what they're doing in this
5209520	5213640	game because it's one of those things that's optional. You can, you can earn the stuff
5213640	5218360	in game, which you know is, is any Gran Turismo game kind of did that. Or you can buy it if
5218360	5224160	you are too impatient to wait and unlock the stuff yourself. Here's where I think people
5224160	5226920	get miffed at this kind of thing because I'm sure there's a lot of you sitting at home
5226920	5233400	going, you know, why is Loki mad? This isn't a big deal. I think some of us feel like,
5233400	5236800	especially some of us that really did the old school gaming and lived through the NES
5236800	5241720	phase and so forth. I remember a day when you would pause the game, press up, up, down,
5241720	5244720	down, left, right, left, right, BA, start, and now your ship is fully decked out with
5244720	5247440	everything you need to beat the game. And some of us, that's the only way we wanted
5247440	5252800	to play the game, right? Now, if you want the fully decked out ship, you could sign
5252800	5257480	on and pay $3.99 to get the special unlock key. You know who we have to blame? That's,
5257480	5262960	that's, that's, you know, who started this bullshit. It's always the same company that
5262960	5270280	starts this bullshit. EA. Cause remember it was with, I want to say the Godfather, the
5270280	5275640	PlayStation two version, have the codes that you can put in with the controller, just like
5275640	5279640	you would normally the original Xbox version, have the codes you put in the controller,
5279640	5284200	the Xbox 360 version, have the codes, or I should say the cheats that you buy on the
5284200	5294480	Xbox live marketplace. EA is the root of all evil. It's, it's, it's a joke. Yes. But in
5294480	5300080	the sense, yes they are. They are the root of all evil in the gaming industry because
5300080	5304080	they came up with the concept of this project, $10 thing where they would do these online
5304080	5308320	passes. Everybody jumped on that shit. They did this thing with, you know, like, Hey,
5308320	5312440	you know what? We can sell shit that we give away for free on other platforms because people
5312440	5316680	will buy him because they really want to do that stuff. And so let's just sell it. And
5316680	5321400	sure enough, they do it and it's just gone downhill from there. But they're the ones
5321400	5330120	that always seem to be, I don't know, innovating in that area, I guess if you will. So yes,
5330120	5336600	I am throwing shade at them because it is ridiculous. And you know, did Loki just say
5336600	5346720	on the show that he's throwing shade? What can I say, Rob? You've rubbed off on me. What's
5346720	5352200	happened? I know I'm embarrassed myself. Well, you did say you had cooties before. I guess
5352200	5357520	so. I guess so. All right. Uh, okay. On a, on a much more serious note, cause this, uh,
5357520	5362880	this news sucks. There's really no easy way to put it. Uh, an actor named Danny Wells
5362880	5368160	passed away this week and he was 72 years old. Although you might not recognize the name,
5368160	5374160	you probably recognize the character. He played Luigi on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show when
5374160	5379280	it was on in the eighties. Um, with captain Lou. That's right. Captain Lou. Unfortunately,
5379280	5383840	he had passed away a few years ago, so, uh, the brothers are reunited. They have both
5383840	5393760	well, some people though, can't bear. They can't stand to not point out the irony that
5393760	5398600	Nintendo had made this the year of Luigi and this is how it ends. It's kind of one of those like,
5398600	5404120	wow, that joke's kind of sick, but it is, it is awkward. You know what I mean? Like,
5404120	5409200	I don't know what word to put on that. It is a little strange that this is the year was not
5409200	5416640	dead. Is he? No. John Lake was almost not dead. He played Luigi in the movie because just, yeah,
5416640	5422000	Bob Hoskins isn't dead either. So whatever. But Danny Wells did pass away this week. So, um,
5422000	5427120	rest in peace and thanks for the memories from the Super Mario Brothers Super Show. All right,
5427120	5433000	let's travel back to a time in gaming's history. Can we get a real twisted version of the Super
5433000	5437920	Mario Brothers show with like Danny DeVito playing Mario or something like that? Never say
5437920	5442240	never. Anyway, I think he's too busy with the Always Sunny in Philadelphia show though. All
5442240	5447080	right. It's the classic game of the week. It's a chance for us to go into the gaming vault and
5447080	5453080	find a game where Dark Sakura says, Hey, why aren't you playing this? Maybe find a game where
5453080	5457760	Wikipedia isn't making me log in. I didn't know you had to log in. Yeah, I didn't think you had
5457760	5464080	to either. So let's see if this reloads. Okay. They get the classic game of the week is the
5464080	5469520	second of unreleased games that I have spoken about on the show. Although I've mentioned this
5469520	5478760	one many, many times. It's Thrill Kill. Yeah. So, um, it was an unpublished game from 1998 that came
5478760	5484720	out on the PlayStation. And the reason why I'm bringing this one up is the fact that it was
5484720	5493320	really one of the, uh, big games that sort of people were able to get ahold of it because of
5493360	5498120	the internet, you know, someone leaked out the version and since then we've had, you know,
5498120	5507000	plenty of other games come out, you know, didn't I bring up, uh, before I, uh, you know, Space
5507000	5510440	Fantasy Zone was the other game I had reviewed, but you know, there's been other ones too, like
5510440	5517120	the Crystal Dynamics, um, uh, Macross game, a Robotech game that never came out, but people
5517120	5521080	have played it because the prototypes out online. Um, so Thrill Kill is one of those games. And the
5521080	5527120	big thing about this one is that it was supposed to be a four player fighting game, which I think
5527120	5532320	it got turned into that Wu-Tang Clan game or something the engine did. Um, but this one was
5532320	5540320	really a lot more of the, uh, BDSM, you know, had a lot more of the fetish thing and a lot more of
5540320	5547480	the, you know, crazy murder cannibalism cause it was gross. And then you had the character Judas
5547480	5553960	that one of the extra characters looked like Ken and Ryu attached to the torso, you know, with one
5553960	5561560	being upside down or the other. And by the way, that was like the single worst, uh, uh, ending of
5561560	5569280	that game too. Cause that was the first version I beat the game with. Um, so yeah, it was completed before, um, it was canceled and it
5569280	5574200	did get leaked out and now people are able to play it on emulators, modded consoles. I mean, we had,
5574200	5581920	um, the, uh, Game Shark thing on ours. So we, you know, after we used to use the paperclip and then
5581920	5587480	after that we ended up using a Game Shark to play our downloads and stuff like that. So yeah, um, it
5587480	5593760	was developed by Paradox Development and then later Midway Los Angeles. And it was supposed to be
5593760	5603840	published by Virgin Interactive who was acquired by EA Pacific. Oh, EA. And then, um, EA canceled the game
5603880	5609080	because they didn't want to publish a senselessly violent game that would hurt their image. Like they
5609080	5619160	fucking needed it. Um, so anyway, um, that guy just like pretended to sodomize the other guy and then kick
5619160	5626000	him in the butt. That's just mean. Oh, she did it too. And then she hit him with an electric prod. Yeah, that's
5626600	5638400	Jamie. That's gross. This game is so gross. Okay, Rob's mom. Um, why don't you read a book? You know
5638400	5648440	what? That video that was on the internet just popped into my mind. Read a book, read a book, read a motherfucking book. Anyway,
5648480	5655640	um, it was the type of game that it is. It's a closed 3d room and basically four players fight to the death.
5656000	5663520	It has, um, thrill kills, which are like fatalities and you build up a kill meter. Um, so your bloodlust rises.
5663560	5669880	Ooh. And then you kill somebody in blood. It's gross. So basically the plot of the story is that 10 souls have gone
5669960	5679760	and descended into hell and their hell is based off of, um, the real world's, uh, sort of deviance, like the BDSM
5679760	5691680	person. You have Cletus, the, you know, butcher guy. You have, uh, uh, a Dr. Faustus is one of the characters. Um, I was
5691680	5699280	looking in chat room. Now I'm thinking buy some speed stick. It's not expensive. Anyway. Um, yeah, the chat room is
5699280	5706920	starting to quote that video. Maybe I should have made that cookie. Anyway. So moving forward is basically, um, each
5706920	5714880	of the characters is a murderer and, um, they are being judged and so are put into fighting so that one of them can
5714880	5725840	reincarnate. Um, they go in hopes of being reborn. So yeah, the game, um, it was really, um, like the official US
5725840	5732520	PlayStation magazine counted as one of the most overrated canceled games and they were very, uh, correct with their
5732520	5738320	quote. It got lots of hype, but it really sucked too. We just played this because it was hilarious. So yeah, I was
5738320	5746040	right. It was remade into Wu-Tang Shaolin style and, um, the engine was also used for a two player X-Men Mutant
5746040	5752520	Academy, um, that was put out by Activision and its sequel and Rock'em Sock'em Robots Arena that was put out by
5752520	5762400	Mattel. Um, and Game Informer linked this, uh, 10th on a list of the top 10 games that almost were. It really was
5763520	5772880	very bad. The music in this was done by an industrial band called Contagion and another group called Dying Fetus did
5772880	5779040	music that was incorporated into the game, but was not recorded exclusively for Thrill Kill. And that is the classic
5779040	5785640	game. And I had to bring it up because again, this was one of the first really big ones that spread because of the
5785640	5797480	internet. And so while it was a festering pile of shit, because it really was, it was notable for being internet
5797480	5804880	related. Some movies are classics because they're so bad, like Showgirls, right? So, you know, a classic game can
5804880	5813040	still be one that, uh, you know, is of questionable taste like that one, which is gross. Well, maybe you should go
5813040	5819880	read a book, read a book, get some speed stick. It's not expensive. All right. Uh, that's gonna do it for this first
5819880	5824240	half of the show, but we have plenty more show to come, including the Fugu Question of the Week, rapid fire news,
5824240	5830600	your emails, your phone calls, much more. And yes, there might even, if you're all good kids just in time for the
5830600	5838080	holidays, I may have a story near the end about pornography. So stay tuned and we'll get to all that and more when we
5838080	5840320	come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5843040	5855480	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this December the 8th of 2013 with the 530th episode of
5855480	5862720	our program. Uh, all right. We've had a lot of gaming news so far, but there's plenty more news to come. So let's get
5862720	5863840	right back into it. Loki.
5863840	5876120	All right. Um, so let's talk a little bit about, um, one of the announcements that was at the whole VGX and that was
5876120	5886600	that Cranky Kong is going to be the new character that's joined the roster for Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze. Yes, this
5886600	5895120	was the big announcement that Nintendo had been teasing about on Twitter and everybody everywhere else that they got on
5895120	5903040	the show to share this incredibly important piece of information. Oh, and the release date of February 21st. What a
5903040	5904080	wasted opportunity.
5905880	5912400	Well, if they've got nothing else to say, I mean, I don't even bother being there. I mean, seriously. Well, I don't know.
5912400	5918680	Like I get the whole like wanting to build hype for the game that's coming out and everything, but I think, and I don't know
5918680	5925680	who's to really to blame for this, if it's Nintendo's fault or if it's internet slash fans fault that this was hyped up, like OMG,
5925680	5930440	they're going to show a new Zelda. They're not going to show. I don't think that they would do that, but like, but there was
5930440	5936200	people out there that that was the expectation bar in some people's heads, you know, it's just, it's not even that exciting of
5936200	5943240	news. I mean, it's, I agree. It was, it was, it was blown up to be way bigger than what it ended up being. But I mean, this is
5943240	5948320	like, this is like kind of one of those bullet points that they go and, you know, during their Nintendo directs, Oh, and by the
5948320	5954200	way, we have those exclusive news on a new character for blah, blah, blah. I mean, it was something that really didn't need to
5954200	5962440	be, you know, he didn't need to go to this show to do that. I will say though, that there's a part of me that does kind of see
5962440	5968760	the humor and that Nintendo really hyped up that they were going to give VGX a big exclusive. And then they kind of pooped on
5968760	5976480	that. Like that is kind of funny in a way you have to, you have to see the humor in that at least that is kind of, I mean, I don't
5976480	5982920	know. I'm sure they would have to have shared the news with them, but it'd been kind of, let's just play make believe here for a
5982920	5987060	little bit. It would have been funny that they didn't tell them what they was. And so they, Oh yeah, we're gonna give them on the
5987060	5995100	shows. It's gonna be incredible. Yeah. And they dropped the bomb. Hey, cranky gongs and donkey code. What? That's what you
5995100	6002340	had? Seriously? Scott of Tron and chat says the host seemed pissed after this announcement. So maybe they didn't. They did
6002340	6007140	see you have his, they're like, Oh, what about like news on a Metroid or something like that? I heard some people on Twitter
6007140	6013580	were saying that it almost came off as rude, like that Nintendo, that they were kind of rude to Nintendo. I mean, again, that
6013580	6018460	could be through fandom lens. I didn't watch it, but what was your impression? Did you see that? I saw the clip because they
6018460	6026700	have this like kind of, you know, uh, edited clip thing of all the moments of the show, you know, all the like shit that went
6026700	6035980	down and I did see that and I don't know. I, my reaction probably would have been the same thing. Like, Ooh, cool. No, really.
6036020	6040500	What's your, what's your special little exclusive announcement that you're going to have? I mean, that was a cool trailer and
6040740	6046500	you know, Donkey Kong, but what's your real announcement? Oh, that was the real announcement. Oh, you're going to give us a
6046500	6054900	release date? Grool. And that's what he said. He's like, Hey, but I already gave your release date and yeah, I caught the, I
6054900	6061620	caught the joke and I gave you the release date and this new exclude character. What else did you want? You're like, fuck
6061620	6069420	something else. You know, I, that's kind of the reaction that it seemed like that they were giving. And yeah, I seriously, it's
6069420	6076580	like, who gives a shit? I mean, it's, it's not like it's, I don't know. It's not that big a deal. I mean, yeah, that's cool.
6076580	6082380	It's a playable character. All I'm saying is that Nintendo may not be the ones to really blame for that. And if you look at it
6082380	6090940	from a trolling perspective, it's great. I understand that. But who, who is this? I mean, Nintendo has to understand where
6090940	6098700	their dera demographic is, who is watching an award show about video games, not casual people that play video games. It's
6098700	6104540	people that are fucking dedicated hardcore into video games. They're going to spend the time watching a video games award
6104540	6113980	show. And when you put this out there, no one gives a shit. In fact, they just, it further reinforces the fact that Nintendo
6113980	6118700	just doesn't get what I want. You know? Yeah. Like this would have been a great time to announce, I mean, to be, to be fair,
6118700	6124340	it's, I'm not like, I'm not totally defending Nintendo here or whatever, because this is a, this would be a great
6124340	6129980	opportunity to come out and say, virtual console games will now be playable across the internet and the camera on your
6129980	6136740	Wii U, you can see your opponent. Like, how amazing would that be? Except that is never going to happen. That's what
6136740	6140820	frustrates people about Nintendo. Even if you want to do something lame like announce a character or something, do it for a
6140820	6146100	game that your hardcore fan base is actually going to go after, which would be Smash Brothers. You know, now it's a new
6146100	6151620	Smash Brothers character or something. Cranky Kong is the new Smash Brothers character. Okay, that's a little bit more
6151620	6160140	interesting now. Yeah. You know, it's just this, whatever. For me, I'm not buying the game. I don't even own the console, so it's
6160140	6167380	not a big deal, but it's just kind of like, you had the opportunity to hype this big thing and then you could have just, I've been on
6167380	6173420	the fence about this Donkey Kong game. I don't really, you know, I like the Donkey Kong Country games, but I just don't, I don't
6173420	6179260	know. I just kind of feel like there'll be other stuff I want to play when this game comes out. This didn't exactly sway me into
6179260	6185180	the must buy category. Let's just put it that way. Donkey Kong Country was special when it was on Super Nintendo. Yes, and I think
6185180	6189860	it's, I think that's, for me, I'm going to be honest, I think that series is a little played out for me. Yeah, now it's been there done
6189860	6198820	that because there's nothing really advanced graphically or gameplay wise that wasn't done. But then again, then again, Nintendo
6198820	6204420	does platformers very well. This new Mario game is one of the best of the year. But this is the thing is they're trying to, they're
6204420	6211140	kind of saying, Hey, you know, new Super Mario Brothers sold pretty well. Let's take the new Super Mario Brothers gameplay and we'll
6211140	6217260	inject it into yet another game. And that's kind of what they're doing. It's like, Oh, Hey, four player co-op is what's going to be in
6217260	6222660	this game. I'm assuming because they have another character now. Yeah. So there's gonna be four player co-op in this. And it's
6222660	6229020	basically new, new Donkey Kong Country, or, you know, I mean, it's kind of what it seems like to me so much for rapid fire.
6229860	6235460	Act-def made the same point based off the description of the character. He saw the, he made exactly the same point that I was going to
6236020	6237260	Scrooge McCranky Kong.
6238580	6240380	Kinda. Oh, all right, let's move on.
6240420	6249540	Anyways, Final Fantasy 8 came out on Steam. Some people hated it. Some people loved it. It's $11.99. Same price as Final Fantasy 7. That's
6249540	6258540	it. Oh, and they tweaked some things. The Chocobo World thing that was a PocketStation thing. That's actually now synced with the game. I
6258580	6266220	guess you can launch that and play that as well. Um, and then they also have the option to, I think, boost your magic in the game to
6266220	6272540	like level 100. Um, just by putting an option in to make it, I guess, easier. So you don't have to draw as much.
6273660	6280460	That's welcome. That's a welcome change. Okay. Now, now I might buy it. Yeah. Now I'm, uh, yeah, I, this changes everything.
6281260	6282820	Rob, we need to let's play.
6283580	6284620	I'll think about it. Okay.
6285260	6287380	All right. And then, uh, it goes on sale.
6287500	6293260	Kelly, I got to read a real quick comment in the chat about the Nintendo thing and it's, it's really good. So I need to get this out there.
6293500	6299700	As the 200 Matt says, but you know what? Nintendo still makes bank, so they don't have to announce anything. Sadly, it bothers people
6299700	6306460	because Nintendo comes off like the old uncle who keeps giving their nephews the same gift every year for Christmas, the past 20 years.
6306700	6308020	I like it when that gift is money.
6308180	6310260	I thought that analogy was pretty clever anyway.
6310780	6317660	Well, Nintendo's, I mean, to be fair, Nintendo, if we're going to go back to it, Nintendo is starting to serialize their Mario games.
6317860	6321260	You know, we give all these other companies shit for releasing yearly released games.
6321620	6323340	Nintendo's kind of done that with Mario.
6323540	6327100	It's starting to get kind of redundant.
6327100	6330900	Like I don't, I mean, Mario games are good and stuff, but let's, let's mix it up.
6330940	6333740	Like, like I would love to see a new franchise for Nintendo.
6334740	6340820	I would love that, you know, instead of Mario, Metroid, Zelda, Kirby, I guess.
6341420	6346180	I would almost buy that argument except for two big, big reasons.
6346300	6352900	A, the Mario games are almost bar none some of the best of the year every single time they come out.
6352980	6360860	And you know, you don't hear that about a Madden game or even about DDR or whatever serial game you want to talk about because that Mario 3D world is on point.
6361340	6366780	And you know, if they can crank out something like that, then every year, then bring me it every year because that game is fucking amazing.
6367980	6372180	B, Nintendo has tried some other franchises and they flopped.
6372460	6373300	Steel Diver.
6375260	6376500	Have they really tried?
6376700	6378100	Was that really an attempt?
6378220	6384500	They put it out as, you know, a somewhat launch title for the 3DS and then that was it.
6384540	6386260	They didn't support it any further than that.
6386380	6387420	It wasn't really an attempt.
6387460	6388540	Nintendo Land.
6388540	6391940	Monita isn't exactly going to be an in-demand Smash Brothers character.
6391980	6393020	Let's be real.
6395180	6396460	Monita's a little done.
6396500	6398460	Monita's going to get unplugged after that one.
6398500	6398860	Come on.
6399740	6400100	I don't know.
6400180	6402060	I just think that there's a lot more they could be doing.
6404180	6405580	Final Fantasy Realm Reborn.
6405860	6409340	PlayStation 4 version is going to launch April 2014.
6409420	6411180	At least that's what's been announced in Japan.
6411220	6413180	Well, we found when you're going to get your system again, Rob.
6413500	6413860	Right.
6414340	6419100	I think it's probably most likely going to have probably around the same time for North America as well.
6419140	6420660	So that's exciting.
6421540	6423940	And that was a 100% completely accurate statement by Jason.
6425220	6426660	YYR makes a very good point.
6427100	6429620	How about a new Star Fox that plays like Star Fox?
6429660	6430500	How about a new F-Zero?
6430540	6431620	Developed by Nintendo.
6433060	6433500	Yes.
6434020	6440420	Well, here I have some Nintendo news that, you know, might, I don't know, might change things a little bit.
6440420	6442180	But honestly, this one, not really.
6442220	6447300	Because Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams could be coming to Wii U in 2014.
6447340	6450340	Some of the new DLC for the Wii U.
6451460	6457420	Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, it's a good game, but it's like, this isn't the type of news that's really going to turn a lot of heads.
6457460	6458860	It's just, okay, you know, cool.
6458900	6460940	Indie's on Wii U, still going there.
6460980	6464020	And it's nice to hear about DLC actually working on Wii U.
6464380	6465620	So, cool.
6466220	6467220	So there you go.
6467540	6478340	They do say now, in an interview with the studio head, Arian Gorsh, says that the Wii U version is more fun than other console versions because it was revised for a cleaner cut.
6478660	6482420	And they say the Wii U is the best console for indie releases.
6483260	6491700	That's what makes this noteworthy, if nothing else, is that, you know, even though some big studios are turning away and shunning the Wii U, some of the indies really, really love it.
6492580	6495820	Some other people that really, really love the Wii U, Time Magazine.
6495820	6506540	And usually I wouldn't note these types of things, but when it's coming from something that's a little more mainstream and not like gamer or tech focused, like Time Magazine, and granted they have different sections.
6507100	6517660	But Time Magazine came out with an article that said, these are 10 reasons why this holiday season you should get a Wii U and not a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One.
6518220	6530380	And this isn't really something that the media at large is really talking about because everybody's focusing on PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 1, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, like a lot of people kind of already written off Wii U.
6530700	6535460	But a time writer, Matt Peckham, came out and said, you know what, here's some reasons why you should choose the Wii U.
6535460	6536580	It boils down to this.
6536900	6539140	Number one, it has the games you want to play now.
6539500	6542100	Number two, and it'll have the games you want to play next year.
6542540	6545780	Number three, the Wii U game pad is a portable console.
6546660	6548340	That's a little sketch.
6548340	6549620	And I'm also kind of scratching-
6549620	6552260	And by portable you mean within your house then maybe.
6552420	6559660	And I'm also scratching my head at the games you want to play next year and the games you want to play now because what if those games have to be from EA, then you're not playing those games.
6560580	6565180	Number four, it is $300, which is $100 less than the PlayStation 4, so it's the cheapest.
6565420	6568300	Number five, there's no annual subscription fee.
6568660	6571260	Number six, it's high def enough.
6571860	6575140	Number seven, Wii U games are cheaper on balance.
6575300	6577340	I think that has to do with DLC and all that.
6577780	6579940	Number eight, Nintendo has the eShop.
6579940	6581620	Sony and Microsoft have Nada.
6581700	6585740	That makes no sense to me where he was going with that bullet point because-
6585740	6588300	Yeah, I didn't get that one there, I straight up laughed at that one.
6588860	6591980	This whole article seems kind of, you know, pantsy.
6592380	6603620	Yes, but I think there's too many people that have written off the Wii U when I think in some ways the Wii U does make a decent case where it could be the system this year.
6603980	6608740	And you can wait on the other systems until next year because it does have more games that are available, period.
6608740	6618380	I'll tell you what, since I was such a great marketing person for the PlayStation 4 last week, allow me to provide my services for the Wii U.
6619460	6622660	The Wii U is a good choice for your family.
6622660	6630220	It has a lot of great family games, especially if you love the Nintendo games that you played a long time ago, it's going to have a lot of your favorite classics and stuff.
6630220	6632420	And that's what you're looking for. This is going to be a great console for you.
6632500	6637060	Plus the second screen controller is awesome when someone wants to watch TV or play something else or whatever.
6637060	6638900	I mean, it's great as far as that goes.
6639700	6644420	And yes, it is cool that you don't have to pay for an online subscription for their online service.
6644420	6645820	That's a plus.
6646140	6650500	And also a lot of the games are going to be cheaper, usually.
6651940	6659820	Then again, also there's, I don't know, I should say a lot more family friendly options for the Wii U.
6659820	6663180	And what else could I possibly say?
6664700	6667780	If you like Mario and Zelda games that much, get one.
6668100	6673300	It's also the only console that's kind of focused on family gameplay and more local gameplay as well.
6673420	6676100	And it's also a console that's very friendly to indie games.
6676100	6680780	So you're going to find a lot of the games that have the same features and kind of gameplay that you...
6680780	6682980	That's funny because that was dude's number nine.
6682980	6685620	It has an indie lineup, has a decent indie lineup.
6685780	6691340	By the way, just to clarify the eShop thing, the writer was talking more about the virtual console and the backwards compatibility
6691340	6695860	where you can play the Nintendo, Super Nintendo and Wii games all because of virtual console.
6695860	6698100	It wasn't so much the fact that it has an online store.
6698100	6701180	It was more what's available in that store, the classic games.
6702260	6708180	And then number 10, his reason is that it is more than just a game system with the whole TV and remote integration.
6708380	6716100	Again, that bullet point's a little bit shaky because Xbox One, you can do the whole watch TV in your Xbox.
6716100	6719940	I mean, it's... I don't see where... I mean, I like... Don't get me wrong.
6719940	6726340	I'm not knocking what Wii U does because that TV stuff where you can chat during like big TV events is different.
6726340	6730420	It's neat, but it's not... I don't think it's nearly as strong of a bullet point.
6730420	6732060	I think if you're honestly looking...
6732060	6738020	If you're buying a console for your family and you haven't bought a game console ever or in a long time,
6738180	6742980	I say your best option is probably to go PlayStation 3 and Xbox or Xbox 360.
6742980	6744500	They're gonna be cheaper than the Wii U.
6744500	6747860	There's a lot more games, a lot cheaper games out there,
6747860	6752340	and they're gonna have the games you're gonna wanna play this year and next year as well.
6752340	6754660	Plus, you can use it for TV and all that other stuff.
6754660	6758100	Not knocking the Wii U as far as that goes, but they just don't...
6758100	6762100	They have games that, you know, they have the Nintendo games and you're only gonna be able to find them there.
6763220	6764820	And, you know...
6764820	6766340	Alright, we gotta get past this.
6766340	6767860	Buy a 3DS. There you go.
6768180	6771140	The things that Nintendo has to work on, according to the article, just to be fair.
6771940	6773460	Drop the system price again.
6774340	6778820	We need a new killer Zelda or Metroid or new Nintendo IP we haven't seen before.
6778820	6780420	Almost echoing what we just said.
6780420	6785620	And needs more third-party games, which I really don't know how they're gonna get out of that one.
6785620	6788420	It may take throwing money at people. We'll see.
6788420	6790740	Alright, one other thing I wanna talk about...
6790740	6793380	Wait a second. I gotta ask here.
6793380	6795220	It says, thanks, Colette, at the bottom there.
6795300	6799140	And then at the very top, though, it's written by a guy named, you know...
6799140	6802580	This particular website was tipped off from somebody else, probably.
6802580	6807380	Colette tipped off my Nintendo news about the time article.
6808340	6810100	Oh, okay, got it. Matt Peck...
6810100	6811060	Okay, I...
6811060	6812100	Okay, so that...
6812100	6812600	I...
6813220	6814020	Should've looked where...
6814020	6814900	I don't know.
6814900	6816420	It just seemed very vague.
6816420	6819540	It was very thrown, extended, multiple...
6819540	6820100	Yeah.
6820100	6820500	Alright.
6820500	6821540	Alright, moving on.
6822180	6827220	There's some news about the Typing of the Dead DLC for Typing of the Dead Overkill.
6827860	6828340	This time...
6828340	6830340	Now, you might be thinking, Rob, didn't you talk about this last week?
6830340	6832980	But no, this is different, because this one is free!
6832980	6835460	Free DLC, as opposed to having to pay for it.
6835460	6842020	So, this DLC will turn the game's phrases into lines of commentary from Football Manager.
6842980	6846580	So, if you wanna type football phrases, such as,
6847140	6854340	horror leg break, spooned it over, agent's fees, little flick off, Manchester Derby...
6855140	6857940	If you wanna type any of those phrases, you can do that.
6857940	6859860	It's cute, and it's free.
6859860	6860820	So, cool.
6861940	6863380	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
6863380	6864340	I have some stuff.
6866020	6872580	First of all, for fans of the Ys series, there is a fan translation for Ys V.
6873300	6879780	That was, it never came out in the US, it came out in 1995 on the Super Famicom,
6879780	6886020	and instead of the type of combat that the earlier Ys games had,
6886020	6890660	it was a lot more Zelda-like, for lack of a better description.
6891940	6894580	And since, basically, if I do remember correctly,
6894580	6896740	I think it's the same group that did Ys IV Dawn of Ys.
6897620	6899620	So, if you want it, go get it.
6900580	6909140	Also, Ultra Street Fighter IV will actually be available as a digital upgrade,
6909140	6913860	that is going to be for $14.99 in early June.
6913860	6917220	That's also the same price as in terms of Euros,
6917220	6920100	so they're actually kind of getting it a little bit cheaper than...
6921380	6924260	No, they're getting it more expensive than we are.
6924260	6925220	So, oops.
6925940	6930180	So, you can get the full bundle, however, for $40.
6931300	6937380	And I watched the location testing for it.
6937380	6938580	Some pretty neat stuff.
6938580	6940980	Poison actually was pretty, pretty badass.
6941860	6945860	And then, for Video Games Live,
6946660	6951220	Akira Yamaoka is going to be at the Dubai show on December 13th.
6951220	6954740	So, if you're there, film it, and send it to me.
6956180	6957620	And stalk him for me, because...
6958980	6959540	Yeah.
6959540	6960740	I mean, no.
6960740	6961240	Oh, no.
6962900	6963400	All right.
6964580	6966820	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6969220	6970180	He...
6970180	6976420	Yamaoka did the soundtrack, or some aspect thereof, to Bioshock?
6977620	6978820	Where's an evil?
6978820	6980020	I'm confused about this.
6980020	6983540	I think that's just some of the other stuff that they're playing.
6983620	6986100	That his spin on it could be...
6986100	6986500	Maybe.
6986500	6986980	Could be.
6986980	6991060	It's either his spin on it, or it's just something Video Games Live plays the music from that stuff.
6991060	6992900	I was very confused for a moment to continue.
6992900	6994980	I think it's Video Games Live, probably.
6994980	6995220	Yeah.
6995940	6996660	All right.
6996660	6998740	Let's get into the FUGL question of the week.
6998740	7001780	You take Facebook, you take Google, you smash it together, you get FUGL.
7001780	7015860	Let's go to our question, as we do post every week on our Facebook page.
7015860	7022020	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio
7022020	7025300	are the places where you can follow us on the social networkings.
7025300	7029940	And we thought this week, in honor of Danny Wells, who passed away this week,
7029940	7033140	we thought we'd ask a question about 80s and 90s television shows,
7033140	7034900	based on video games and gaming culture.
7034900	7036580	You guys have your favorites, I'm sure.
7036580	7038420	Did you watch any of them growing up?
7038420	7039460	What were your favorites?
7039460	7042020	Do you have any memories you want to share about those games?
7042020	7042900	So let's get to it.
7042900	7045460	Just a couple answers here over on Google Plus.
7047380	7050660	Rhetortainment says, wait, I thought John Languizamo died.
7050660	7053540	I remember John from my first hangover when I watched Land of the Dead,
7053540	7055780	because it was on TNT and I didn't want to move.
7055780	7057700	That was a nice way to spend a Tuesday afternoon.
7057700	7058420	I think there was rumors...
7058500	7060260	Somebody else from Land of the Dead died, though.
7060260	7063140	There was rumors about him a few years ago, but it's not true.
7064340	7068100	Just like the kid from the Wonder Years is not Marilyn Manson.
7068100	7070820	And what other big rumors are out there?
7070820	7072020	Anyway, all right.
7072980	7076500	ActDeaf replied on Google Plus and says, as many will probably say,
7076500	7078660	I watched the Super Mario Brothers Super Show,
7078660	7083060	though I always waited anxiously every Friday for the Legend of Zelda episode.
7083060	7085140	It was cheesy as hell, but it was the 80s.
7085140	7088420	So excuse me, princess.
7088420	7091060	But my favorite video game show or cartoon from back in the 90s
7091060	7094260	is probably Sonic the Hedgehog or Sonic Saturday AM.
7094260	7096020	That series was freaking awesome.
7097620	7100500	I also lived for Zelda Fridays myself.
7100500	7102580	That was like, if I were to answer this question,
7103300	7105060	Zelda Fridays were where it was at.
7105060	7108340	That and somebody had said it here on Facebook.
7108340	7109940	I'll read this answer from Degenerate Johnny.
7109940	7111300	This is my other answer.
7111300	7113460	If I could name one video game show from my childhood,
7113460	7115140	it would be StarCade.
7115140	7117300	It was an 80s game show, pun intended,
7117300	7120260	that challenged the skills and video game knowledge of gamers,
7120260	7121860	which was a real treat to watch.
7122740	7124260	Back in the good old days of G4,
7124260	7127380	the network re-aired old episodes of StarCade,
7127380	7131300	which brought back fond memories I felt when I first saw the show.
7132980	7134580	That would also be my other answer.
7134580	7136020	I loved game shows.
7136020	7137380	I lived for game shows growing up.
7137380	7139700	I watched game show network when I could,
7139700	7141380	when it was, you know, early available.
7141540	7143220	USA used to show a bunch of old game shows too.
7143220	7144020	I remember that.
7144020	7147860	And so, yeah, I loved that show.
7147860	7150900	And honestly, it would be my dream.
7150900	7154340	If I could do anything in my little broadcasting career,
7154340	7157940	quote unquote, getting to host a remake of StarCade
7157940	7159860	would be my ultimate dream in life.
7159860	7162260	But, you know, I know that that's going to be
7162260	7163620	a little bit difficult to do.
7163620	7165940	But if you ask me,
7165940	7167540	what do you really want to do more than anything?
7167620	7172420	I would love to host a resurgence of that show StarCade,
7172420	7174260	because that game, that show was awesome.
7175140	7178420	Unfortunately, with arcades kind of on their way out,
7178420	7179220	I don't know.
7179220	7181780	It would have to be focused on retro games or something.
7181780	7185540	Maybe with the King of Kong and how well that does and all that.
7185540	7185860	All right.
7186420	7186820	Anyway.
7187940	7188900	Barcade.
7188900	7189540	Yeah, you never know.
7190820	7192180	Let's see some other answers here.
7193700	7197140	KJ says very fond memories of GameProTV.
7197140	7199380	Captain and the GameMaster, Super Mario Bros. Super Show,
7199380	7201940	and the short lived Legend of Zelda cartoon.
7201940	7203860	Although I used to yell at my TV when those kids
7203860	7206180	were playing video game challenges on Nick Arcade.
7206180	7208420	Mainly because those kids couldn't play Neo Geo games
7208420	7209380	to save their lives.
7210260	7212180	Or any other system for that matter.
7213220	7215220	Tiger Claw says as a kid growing up in the 80s,
7215220	7217380	I remember watching Saturday Supercade,
7217380	7220100	a block of cartoons based on classic 80s arcade games
7220100	7223380	like Donkey Kong, which was Mario's first appearance on TV.
7223380	7225700	I remember watching all cartoon versions of the first three
7225700	7227060	Super Mario games as well.
7227540	7230180	Captain and the GameMaster was also my favorite series growing up.
7232260	7234500	Ronnie B says Pokemon, if that counts.
7235620	7236100	Why not?
7236660	7237220	It does.
7237220	7237620	It does.
7238740	7239140	Let's see.
7240260	7244900	Fifth Dream says I like the crap out of the Qbert cartoon when I was a kid.
7244900	7247060	And I still get the theme song from the pole position
7247060	7249060	cartoon stuck in my head now and then.
7249060	7251780	I also liked a Dragon Quest anime called Dragon Warrior
7251780	7253780	that I recorded every week on VHS.
7254340	7255220	You know what?
7255220	7257620	I actually, I just mentioned Qbert in the chat room.
7258260	7260340	I used to watch that too because it was sort of like,
7260340	7262900	they're on another planet, but they're based off of 50s American culture.
7264100	7264740	And Pac-Man.
7265380	7267860	Jonko, one of our friends from Koopa Club replied and said,
7267860	7270820	I used to watch Captain N every morning before school.
7270820	7273460	And then when I came home, I'd run around with my NES controller
7273460	7276260	wrapped around my waist like a belt, brandishing my zapper.
7276260	7279860	I convinced myself that I was going to be Captain N when I grew up.
7279860	7283780	20 years later, I made it happen through the magic of cosplay.
7283780	7284100	Awesome.
7284100	7286580	And by the way, I just want to point out Jonko's little icon right now,
7286580	7290100	his little user picture is his cap, is Captain N cosplay.
7290100	7290980	So props to you.
7292100	7294340	One more answer here from Raginator who said,
7294340	7297380	yeah, I watched stuff like Captain N, Super Mario Brothers Super Show,
7297380	7299700	and it's ilk back in the late 80s and early 90s.
7299700	7302580	Even then I thought that the quality of shows were kind of crappy,
7302580	7305780	but considered the overall lack of any real meaningful choices
7305780	7309060	of gaming related programming, I felt resigned to picking the
7309060	7311460	less crappy of the crappy.
7311460	7313220	Those are some of the answers from Facebook.
7313220	7317700	If you want to see the rest, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
7318260	7319780	Any other shows that y'all want to bring up?
7319780	7321620	I think that the chatters hit on mine.
7321620	7323060	Well, there was the Pac-Man one.
7323060	7327300	Yeah, even the Christmas special, which I actually went back and watched.
7328020	7328660	It was horrible.
7329540	7331380	I knew I watched Captain N.
7331380	7333620	I hated how the characters were characterized,
7333620	7335780	but I loved seeing the different worlds that they'd go to.
7335780	7337140	I thought the Game Boy was stupid.
7337780	7341300	And while it isn't a video game one, it's definitely one of those 80s
7342020	7346100	things that had to do with the whole pop music thing was I actually liked kid video.
7346980	7348020	Do you remember that?
7348020	7348740	I do.
7348740	7349060	I do.
7349060	7351940	And there was another, there was another game show where at the end,
7351940	7355300	if they did well, they would run through and grab like all the video games they could.
7355300	7356500	With the velcro vest?
7356500	7357060	Yes.
7357060	7357460	Yes.
7358100	7359860	Somebody in chattel shouted out.
7359860	7362180	I used to watch that every Saturday.
7362180	7363620	Yeah, that was the other big video game show.
7363620	7364740	That one was awesome.
7364740	7368020	And then, um, I watched Game Pro TV,
7368580	7370260	especially when they did the Neo Geo review,
7370260	7371700	because I used to have that one on tape.
7372500	7375380	And then I moved out here and Dan had a Neo Geo.
7375940	7378100	And I was like, holy shit, these exist.
7378740	7380500	You know, so it was pretty funny.
7380500	7386340	And, um, I, I loved, uh, I, I really liked Pole Position,
7386340	7387860	which I've got all of that downloaded.
7387860	7388980	Thank you, Tiger Claw.
7388980	7390580	Video Power was the name of it.
7390580	7392180	Video Power, that was definitely it.
7394500	7396580	Do we used to have a listener named Vid Power?
7396580	7397060	We did.
7397060	7397620	Yeah, we did.
7397620	7398120	Yeah.
7398760	7403720	Um, a couple, there was, there was another one that I used to...
7403720	7404840	Nick Arcade.
7404840	7405320	Nah.
7405320	7406280	Well, what about, what about you guys?
7406280	7410120	Well, she's thinking, Loki, Jason, anything you want to throw out there?
7410120	7411560	I missed most of those.
7411560	7413960	And I think that's because I'm just a few years younger than you guys.
7413960	7414520	I wasn't...
7414520	7415240	Oh, rub it in.
7415880	7416680	I, I don't...
7416680	7417640	Nick Arcade though.
7417640	7419240	I was like a teenager when that was out.
7419240	7423400	Well, that's been rerun to fucking infinity, unlike every other show.
7423400	7423800	True.
7423800	7425800	Um, so Nick Arcade is what I live for.
7425880	7432360	There was one that, that, that made me, uh, react in similar ways that wasn't actually
7432360	7433560	video game related.
7433560	7441240	Um, I caught it on, uh, Fox Family, ABC, whatever that, that network has been, uh, called Masters
7441240	7441880	of the Maze.
7442520	7448040	Um, it was, it was a, it was a trivia game and you run through the maze with this big
7448040	7453560	suit and, uh, the, your, your assistant uses the joystick to tell you which way to go and
7453560	7458200	you have all these good gadgets and doodads on your vest that don't actually do anything
7458200	7459160	in a blind or visor.
7459160	7460280	It was, it was silly.
7460280	7460840	Uh, yeah.
7460840	7462920	And love Nick, Nick, Nick Arcade.
7462920	7469800	Um, when I was thinking about shows that I used to watch, PBS had this afterschool special
7469800	7475720	show called Square One and they had, yes, yes, that show was the bomb.
7475720	7476760	Math, Math Man.
7476760	7480440	Yeah, that show was the shit that came to mind as soon as you guys were talking about
7480840	7482120	and math net.
7482120	7483960	I, that was like one of my favorite shows.
7483960	7484600	It was awesome.
7484600	7487000	I used to fucking run the fuck home so I could watch Square One.
7487000	7487960	Like what a nerd.
7487960	7490840	I'm running home to watch educational programming, but that show was the shit.
7490840	7492600	I am glad people are reacting to the show.
7492600	7493000	Yes.
7493000	7493400	Oh God.
7493400	7494840	You never, ever heard of it.
7494840	7495560	Oh, in chat room.
7495560	7496600	I'm sure they're lighting up too.
7496600	7497160	There was that.
7497160	7499000	And then three, two, one contact was huge.
7500520	7505320	Um, I was a little, little, little too young for electric company.
7505320	7506440	I don't remember that as much.
7506440	7506760	Yeah.
7506760	7508760	I, I remember electric company.
7508760	7516520	So that one was, uh, was definitely one for me, but I'm trying to, to,
7517320	7519240	now I'm actually having to pull up a list to remember.
7519240	7519640	Hold on.
7519640	7520680	I've got something for Jason.
7520680	7521080	You ready?
7521080	7521640	You ready?
7521640	7522440	You ready, Jason?
7522440	7525640	You've already seen this much of Square One TV.
7525640	7526920	How much do you figure is left?
7528440	7529800	This is 0.44 on the screen.
7529800	7530200	Here we go.
7533640	7537000	Math Man, your mission is to eat only multiples of six.
7537080	7540280	When you encounter a number, you will have until the count of three to make your decision.
7545000	7546360	Oh no, not the glitch.
7546360	7548680	Why did they ever turn this into an actual game?
7548680	7551320	Like we had 72.
7551320	7552280	Is that a multiples of six?
7552280	7552780	Quick.
7553560	7554200	He ate it.
7554200	7554920	He's right.
7554920	7555420	Okay.
7555480	7556760	Um, why is it?
7556760	7558520	This is why they didn't turn it into a game.
7558520	7562920	Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man.
7562920	7564280	They had number munchers.
7564280	7565640	I think so.
7566360	7567400	Yeah, but that wasn't.
7567400	7569480	Number, number, number, number, number, number.
7569480	7570360	844.
7574360	7580040	So I was looking at other stuff, other ones, Rob, and there was like a really crappy Street
7580040	7585000	Fighter cartoon American done that wasn't, you know, actually as good as any of the anime
7585000	7585500	were.
7586680	7591640	And I know that the, I think that the game was based off of, there was Battle Toads,
7591640	7593000	you know, which was pretty funny.
7593720	7599720	Um, there was a, there was a Mortal Kombat cartoon that was really awful.
7600360	7601880	Um, and Double Dragon.
7601880	7607000	Our, our, our buddy from video game realness, uh, Mega Man 400 is in chat saying no one
7607000	7608440	watched the Mega Man cartoon.
7609000	7610200	Cause nobody mentioned it.
7610200	7617240	I caught, I remember wanting to, I think I caught like five minutes of it while I was,
7617880	7619480	it was absurdly early in the morning.
7619480	7622280	So I woke up, caught a pinch of it and fell back to sleep.
7623000	7623320	Wow.
7623320	7626280	Queen Samia says they have an updated electric company going on now.
7626280	7627240	Do they really?
7627240	7629400	I have to see kind of awesome.
7629400	7630760	I love the electric company.
7630760	7631260	All right.
7631720	7637960	The square one stuff though, just to say we actually had this thing for my homeroom, um,
7637960	7645400	that was square one for school where we would get a news alert thing and then they would
7645400	7649960	show like the math man and they would show just little segments and then do, and this
7649960	7651800	is what's going on with science right now.
7651800	7656120	So we'd get kind of like a, a special version of square one at school.
7656120	7657320	So it was kind of cool.
7657320	7662200	We are currently being yelled at and lectured by a Mega Man 400 in chat for the lack of
7662200	7663480	the Mega Man cartoon.
7664040	7665880	Uh, at some point, I guess I'll have to check that out.
7665880	7669960	Uh, Tiger Claw says there were cartoons that were single shot episodes.
7669960	7671400	Even Bubsy had one.
7671400	7672120	Oh God.
7672120	7672600	Wow.
7672600	7673560	Bubsy 3D?
7673560	7674440	Act F'd?
7674440	7674940	No.
7675640	7676440	What does Act F say?
7676440	7678360	I loved Reboot 2 as a kid.
7678360	7679960	I tried to rewatch it on Netflix.
7679960	7681400	It was terrible.
7682040	7682680	All right.
7682680	7683640	Uh, we got to move on.
7683640	7684920	There's still more gaming news to get to.
7684920	7689080	We could do an entire three hour episode about children's TV shows that we grew up on.
7689080	7692120	Uh, and maybe that'll happen over the holidays when it's really slow.
7692120	7695160	Uh, that could be like a good list list, but for now we got to get to more gaming news.
7695160	7699640	So, you know, we just need to do, we need to do a spinoff show called 30 something T
7699640	7700440	uh, radio.
7701880	7705400	30, the geeks who were in their thirties, the radio show.
7705400	7705880	Oh my God.
7705880	7707960	That you might be onto something dark soccer.

7715000	7715500	All right.
7716200	7716840	Uh, Loki.
7718040	7721240	So, uh, the launch of battlefield four hasn't been that great.
7721240	7726840	Apparently they've had server issues like crazy and dice has been just kind of, um,
7727480	7728600	trying to get things fixed.
7728600	7735240	So to kind of help with that, um, they have halted work on everything but battlefield four.
7735240	7740840	Um, so I guess that's gonna, you know, delay that mirrors edge reboot and star star was
7740840	7741800	bell front.
7741800	7746520	Um, and also the expansions for battlefield four, they want to get the game working.
7746520	7751320	Um, you know, ASAP, we know we still have ways to go with fixing the game.
7751320	7754280	It's that it is absolutely our number one priority.
7754280	7757160	And the team at dice is working nonstop to update the game.
7757880	7761800	And we know players are frustrated and we feel your pain and we will not stop until
7761800	7762440	this is right.
7763400	7765320	So it's good to see that they're taking charge.
7765320	7770440	It's too bad that it took like, you know, a whole, you know, almost two months before,
7770440	7772200	you know, they did that.
7772200	7772360	Yeah.
7772360	7775800	I'm not a battlefield four player myself, but I have heard there have been some issues.
7775800	7777240	So that's, uh, yeah.
7777240	7780360	And code man says there, the servers are shit on PlayStation four.
7780360	7782200	EA game and servers are shit.
7783240	7784120	Say it ain't.
7784120	7786680	So to be fair, a lot of games have launched problems.
7786680	7791160	My beloved Final Fantasy 14 Rome Reborn was kind of a shit-tacular experience the first
7791240	7792520	couple of weeks because of similar issues.
7792520	7793000	Couple of weeks.
7793000	7794680	This game's been out for like six weeks now.
7795400	7796200	No games.
7796200	7802200	Well, I haven't skewed perspective because a, I actually played 1.0 and B the beta went
7802200	7802840	on for so long.
7802840	7804520	It wasn't that I'm in, I'm in battlefield.
7804520	7805080	Oh, battlefield.
7805080	7805400	Oh yeah.
7805400	7805640	Yeah.
7805640	7806440	Well, yeah.
7806440	7808920	No, they, they didn't get on it as fast as they should have.
7808920	7810360	I agree with that.
7811080	7811880	All right.
7811880	7814360	So anyway, uh, moving on with some other news.
7814360	7819560	Uh, this story is about a beloved system of mine, the Commodore 64.
7819560	7822040	Yes, I have Commodore 64 news tonight.
7822040	7822540	Ha.
7823160	7830040	Uh, this is cool because, uh, Paul Kohler and Mikel Hastert, who did a port of super
7830040	7833160	crate box, which was called super bread box.
7833160	7841320	They did a port of super hexagon that is, uh, yeah, which was a more recent game, but
7841320	7844920	they actually ported that to the Commodore 64.
7844920	7847400	So let me actually play a little bit of this in studio.
7848040	7851400	Well, it doesn't really do anything at the beginning, but then when it gets into the
7851400	7859320	video here a little bit, check out that sweet Commodore 64 synth music when it gets a little
7859320	7863160	further here in the video, maybe, but you can actually play this in an emulator or you
7863160	7865080	can actually play it on a regular system.
7867400	7867800	Nice.
7867800	7868600	I'm rocking out.
7870040	7871320	I know what I'm going to play this week.
7872120	7873480	Props to you guys for doing this.
7873480	7875560	This looks great for a Commodore 64 game.
7876520	7881720	I wonder if Terry Cavanaugh likes the Commodore 64, considering that these two last titles
7881720	7886280	have been Commodore 64 looking games for those who did not know.
7887960	7893240	I think a lot of people, I think a lot of people were influenced by the Commodore 64.
7893960	7899560	That was actually, uh, I, with the exception of educational games and maybe one or two
7899560	7902600	other random things like that, which I talked about three weeks ago.
7902600	7908840	Um, I, I never owned a Commodore 64, so I'm pretty distanced from like tape loading and
7908840	7912680	actually understanding its extended basic that you have to use and all that kind of
7912680	7913480	stuff.
7913480	7921160	But I loved the games I played on Commodore 64, uh, Space Taxi, um, Beachhead.
7922280	7925880	Some, I want to say it was Top Gun, but it was something Dogfight like.
7925880	7930680	And then this, I used to play the hell out of this game and it was by the makers of Beachhead.
7930680	7932760	I need to do a let's remember video for this plug plug.
7932760	7933880	Maybe I'll do that this week.
7933880	7935240	It's a good week for YouTube.
7935240	7935480	Yeah.
7936200	7939080	This, uh, it was by the makers of Beachhead.
7939080	7939640	They did a game.
7939640	7944120	This is kind of, it's kind of wrong if you think about it, but it was definitely a relic
7944120	7944840	of the eighties.
7944840	7947160	It was a game called Raid Over Moscow.
7947160	7947960	Do you ever play this?
7949160	7953720	It was a game where like, literally there's nuclear warheads being launched out of Moscow
7953720	7957640	into America and you're kind of going to stop it from happening.
7957640	7960440	And it was, it's kind of controversial at the time when it came out.
7961240	7961640	I don't know why.
7961640	7962440	Why are we on this topic?
7962440	7962680	Sorry.
7963880	7965320	You got me on Commodore 64 kick.
7965320	7968040	And then you said Beachhead and I was like, Oh, did you know the Beachhead makers made
7968040	7969480	this game anyway?
7970440	7973800	Or we could just listen to awesome Chiptune songs that were made on the Commodore 64.
7973800	7974440	I'm down for that.
7974440	7974680	Ooh.
7974680	7979080	You know, could somebody write a new OLR theme in the Commodore 64 said chip that would be
7979080	7979320	rad.
7980280	7980760	Do it.
7980760	7981400	I can ask.
7981400	7982920	Doesn't Bobby do some of that stuff?
7983720	7984200	Maybe.
7984200	7984840	Maybe.
7984840	7985560	All right.
7985560	7986360	Uh, anyhow.
7986360	7986840	Oh, good.
7986840	7990280	I'm not the only one that remembers Dungeon Buster in chat says that's a great game.
7991160	7993160	I always flew the plane into the wall.
7993160	7995880	The very first thing you have to do is fly the plane out of a hangar.
7995880	7997400	Cause you know, you got to get a plane out there.
7997960	8001560	And I always crashed it into the wall cause I was seven and awful at video games.
8002680	8005320	Anyway, uh, let's move on dark soccer.
8005320	8005960	What do you have for us?
8006520	8012920	I'm actually, uh, we're still talking about cartoons in chat and I will freely admit that
8012920	8018840	I loved vehicle Voltron because, and now I'm actually trying to find subtitled copies of
8018840	8020680	die rigger 15 that it was based off of.
8020680	8023480	So I've got all of go lion, which is fucking depressing.
8024520	8032440	So this is a little bit, um, it's, it's related to video games in the terms that it uses the,
8032440	8041960	um, the connect, but there is a robot called Russell that is, um, it was created by scientists,
8042440	8049320	um, at, uh, looks like a Vanderbilt university in Tennessee that uses the connect sensor to work
8049320	8056280	with autistic kids and basically, um, and for people who don't really understand autism very
8056280	8064840	well, um, basically the biggest thing, what, you know, with just about any range of it is having
8064840	8071240	problems with social cues and being overwhelmed very easily by sensory information.
8072200	8077240	And with looking at a human face, there's a lot of information that a person can miss,
8077880	8084520	but working into understanding movements and interaction with a robot that has limited forms
8084520	8091560	of interaction itself has been helping a lot of these kids acclimatize better into a neurotypical
8091560	8092200	society.
8092200	8094600	So it's, it's pretty neat.
8094600	8098920	There's a quote in here from one of the scientists behind it that says autistic children understand
8099000	8101480	the physical world much better than the social world.
8102200	8107240	So since this isn't as complex as a human being, the child isn't overstimulated.
8107240	8113640	But the fact that it's using the connect to sense the child's movements and react to it
8114360	8117720	is, I'd have to say a pretty good application for the technology.
8119480	8127800	So it's, it's nice to hear about, you know, what the technology for gaming is kind of doing
8127800	8131160	for good out there, especially when there's been a lot of dog in on connect lately because,
8131160	8135240	you know, it's a required part of Xbox one and there's really not a lot of games using
8135240	8135640	it.
8135640	8139240	So it is kind of nice to hear some of these other stories that help kind of, oh, this
8139240	8141080	is, this is why this technology is awesome.
8141640	8142280	Exactly.
8142280	8150040	And I think that in this case too, where, you know, like I said, where a human can basically
8150040	8158040	give way too much information for, especially a more advanced autistic case, having a robot
8158040	8162520	that's giving much limited information is a lot easier to process and better for integration.
8163160	8167720	So our, our robot overlords will be kind to us.
8170520	8171320	All right.
8171880	8173960	Let's move on a few more stories before we get to the mailbag.
8173960	8174760	Loki.
8174760	8175080	All right.
8175720	8181640	Um, so as I mentioned in my gaming week, I did play a little bit of just cause to the
8181640	8182600	multiplayer mod.
8183240	8188680	It's right now they're doing their final beta test of the servers and stuff this week.
8189240	8196360	And, um, it will be launching officially on steam December 16th and they haven't given
8196360	8197800	a price to it yet.
8197800	8202040	I don't know if it's going to be free or if it's just going to be something that, um,
8202040	8205960	there's a fee to, but so far so good.
8205960	8207240	And it's, it's pretty fun.
8207240	8210600	So, um, look forward to that, I guess in a couple of weeks.
8210600	8216840	And, uh, if you can definitely join up in the beta if they haven't, um, close out.
8216840	8223400	Yeah, I think, uh, JC dash MP.com and, uh, you can sign up there and get a steam key
8223400	8229160	to, um, uh, yeah, to, uh, get the, uh, latest client there.
8229160	8232440	So, um, recommend you do that if you haven't already.
8233720	8234600	Cause it's fun.
8236680	8241800	You've talked enough about that here on this program, just your excitement for it makes
8241800	8242920	me kind of want to play it.
8242920	8244840	It's cause I bet I can get the game super cheap.
8245480	8247800	Unlike grand theft auto five is still a little pricey.
8247800	8255160	I skipped just cause one, but I like just cause two is the, is the longest adventure
8255160	8259240	hunt collectible, collectible game that I've played ever.
8259240	8268040	And I, and I got to, um, 94, 95, maybe 96% completion, uh, finished the story, started
8268040	8272040	a second play through like this game is one that I'm actually going through completion
8272040	8278440	on the frustrating part is that the game is bugged and you literally cannot reasonably,
8278440	8280920	uh, get a hundred percent collection in that game.
8280920	8283080	But this sounds fucking awesome.
8283160	8283640	So sad.
8283640	8286200	It's windows only PC only and windows only.
8287560	8292520	Well, here's a game that, uh, you'll probably only be able to experience on PC only pretty
8292520	8296760	soon, although not if the publishers are able to get their way at skull girls, which I know
8296760	8298520	a lot of people have been talking about.
8298520	8301800	Um, this game is by publisher autumn games.
8301800	8306840	And, uh, here's the thing they are terminating their business deal with Konami because Konami
8306840	8311880	was the ones that actually, uh, got the game distributed and got it onto the Xbox live
8311880	8314760	arcade and onto the PlayStation network.
8314760	8318600	Well, because they are severing their ties with Konami, Konami has asked that the games
8318600	8319640	be delisted.
8319640	8324520	So skull girls will be removed from the PlayStation network on December 17th and on off Xbox live
8324520	8327880	arcade before the end of the year when the contract expires.
8327880	8334600	Now, um, unfortunately what's happening with this whole thing is that, uh, they want to
8334600	8340680	replace skull girls with a, I guess a different self published build that actually has some
8340680	8343000	of the improvements that the PC update had in it.
8343000	8347160	They're trying to get that out ASAP, but I get the sense they might've been blindsided
8347160	8352120	by this a little bit, that this is going to happen so fast because, uh, the design director
8352120	8358200	for skull girls, Mike Zamet said, uh, that the delisting is, uh, kind of like final fantasy
8358200	8361320	six is magic user casting Ultima before he dies.
8363800	8369320	So, uh, it's, it is a bit of a, uh, uh, thing, but I mean, if you're going to end an agreement,
8370280	8371800	these things are going to happen.
8371800	8375000	So I'm not really sure what to think in this particular scenario.
8375000	8379000	I just hope that the, uh, uh, well, I think it's good that they're going to kind of at
8379000	8382440	least make the new version a little better and they're going to bring some of the improvements
8382440	8382840	over.
8382840	8383800	So that's pretty cool.
8383800	8384920	And so they'll get that up there.
8385640	8390440	They need to get it in, I guess like next week, if before PlayStation quality assurance,
8390440	8393480	like closes for the holidays, if they don't want there to be a gap.
8393480	8397960	But I think the reality is there's probably going to be a little bit of a gap before this
8397960	8403960	game's available again, but maybe they can kind of make, um, make lemonade out of lemons
8403960	8407240	or whatever the hell you want to call it by kind of using this as like another way to
8407240	8409240	kind of relaunch the game and get it out there.
8409240	8412920	You know, when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager.
8413640	8415880	When life gives you lemons, you mix it with vodka.
8418840	8420680	And then burn their house down with the lemons.
8422680	8424840	And then squirt it in their eyes.
8425640	8426360	All right.
8426360	8429800	Uh, let's travel to the mailbag.
8429800	8433400	Um, I, I figured, I knew ActDeft was a fan of Skullgirls by the way.
8433400	8435560	ActDeft in chat says support the steam version.
8435560	8438040	So you do still have a way you can support this game of something.
8438040	8438680	All right.
8438680	8439800	I was actually tempted to get it.
8439800	8442120	So yeah, yeah, it looks, it looks fun.
8442120	8443880	I just, I haven't had a chance to get, grab it yet.
8443880	8447240	I just had a couple of friends on my Tumblr who were super obsessed with Skullgirls.
8447240	8447640	Yeah.
8447640	8452200	So I know a lot more about the backstory of the game without ever having played it.
8452200	8453800	So, all right, let's go to the mailbag.
8453800	8459240	Every week you guys email us mailbag at orange launch trader.com
8459240	8462600	is the place to send us emails and the dark soccer will go to the email bag.
8462600	8464040	She's going to dive in head first.
8464040	8465320	It's sticky.
8466600	8467000	Gross.
8468040	8470680	And she's going to see what emails are in there tonight.
8470680	8471240	We have a lot tonight.
8471240	8471960	Oh my God.
8471960	8474600	We got one from an old school listener.
8474600	8474920	Yay.
8474920	8476120	I love old school listeners.
8476120	8476920	Do you remember?
8476920	8479880	Um, uh, I love new school ones too though for the record.
8479880	8481560	Do you remember Asian buddy Paul?
8481560	8481800	Yeah.
8482440	8483320	Hey, OLR.
8483320	8487320	I was talking about gaming news at work one day and wondered how the podcast was doing.
8487320	8489560	I'm glad you guys are still going very strong.
8489560	8490760	And that's from Asian buddy Paul.
8491880	8494440	Um, well, that literally was an email.
8494440	8495160	Just saying, Hey.
8495800	8496360	Hey.
8496360	8497400	Sup, OLR.
8497400	8498040	Sup.
8498040	8498680	Sup, bro.
8499480	8500440	Sup, bitches.
8502680	8503800	Yeah, we're, we're still here.
8503800	8505160	We're just a little older.
8505160	8505660	Okay.
8506600	8507560	This comes from Robert M.
8508360	8511880	Last episode you were musing about dubstep Christmas music.
8511880	8514600	I got a sample music track a year ago.
8514600	8516520	The capital King's version of Carol of the Bells.
8516520	8518440	Easily one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.
8518440	8519160	I have heard that.
8519160	8519640	And in fact,
8519640	8522120	Pause for Rob to look it up on YouTube and play a podcast.
8522120	8522600	Oh my God.
8522600	8523640	That's exactly what I was doing.
8523640	8525480	And for Jamie's ears to recover.
8525480	8527320	They have that actually at this.
8527320	8532280	There's a court nearby that, um, decorates lights in all their houses.
8532280	8534680	And they have one guy that has that synced up to music.
8534680	8535800	That song actually.
8536520	8537000	It's pretty awesome.
8537000	8539560	I think I saw this in a YouTube ad of all things.
8540600	8541560	Just in the last couple of days.
8541560	8542360	Oh, silly.
8542360	8542840	You too.
8543720	8544280	All right.
8544280	8546600	Well, let me get, let me get to it.
8546600	8547400	All right, here we go.
8547400	8549160	I'll skip ahead a little bit in the song here.
8552280	8554360	This doesn't sound anything too crazy.
8554360	8555480	Let me skip a little further.
8555480	8572600	That should be right there.
8573240	8576760	That's that's what I want to record on all of my, you know, Christmas cards.
8576760	8579400	Now they have the audio Christmas cards and stuff like that right there.
8579400	8580600	Merry Christmas.
8580600	8582360	And it drops right there.
8585320	8585560	Okay.
8585560	8586520	Maybe it wasn't that one.
8586520	8589320	He had actually a really cool Christmas song that was dubstep.
8589320	8590840	But I don't, I don't think it was that.
8590840	8591960	That wasn't very good.
8592760	8593000	Wow.
8596440	8597560	Okay.
8598760	8601800	Which brings me to this most likely non-video game question.
8602360	8607080	Is there Christmas music you enjoy any time of the year regardless of your own traditions?
8607080	8610200	For me, it's the Sonic Santa Claus and They Might Be Giants cover,
8611080	8613560	Nutcracker, uh, Tchaikovsky, Nutcracker Suite,
8614120	8617480	and of course Vince Guiardi's A Charlie Brown Christmas Soundtrack.
8617480	8618920	Keep up the great show.
8619640	8623000	Um, no, I hate Christmas music to be honest.
8623640	8624520	I really do.
8624520	8625320	I never liked it.
8626600	8628360	Except like Bing Crosby.
8628360	8629240	I love the crooners.
8629240	8631000	I get a little bit annoyed with it.
8631000	8632600	It's not that I really hate Christmas music.
8632600	8633640	It just goes on too long.
8633640	8635000	Like Christmas music should be like-
8635000	8636600	I'm tired of Mariah Carey.
8636600	8638040	The week of Christmas.
8638840	8639320	That's it.
8640040	8643160	Not December 1st and certainly not the day after Halloween.
8643720	8644600	The week of Christmas.
8644600	8645160	That's enough.
8646520	8648920	I've got a kind of a weird one that I like.
8648920	8654280	Um, I actually like, um, the soundtrack to Toys.
8655000	8655480	Yes.
8655480	8657800	Toys had a really good soundtrack, but I mean-
8657800	8661080	They had like, it's not really Christmas, but I mean Christmas themes.
8661080	8664280	It was, it was light and fluffy and airy for some of them.
8664280	8665720	But they had like, there was that one song-
8665720	8666840	It was Tori Amos too.
8668120	8669320	Yeah, it was a couple tracks.
8669320	8674200	It was the one, um, the one that they had like the choir of kids singing or something like that.
8674200	8675400	That one's like pretty cool.
8676200	8676920	And Hans Zimmer.
8676920	8678200	I mean Hans Zimmer is fucking awesome.
8678200	8678840	What can you say?
8679480	8681000	For the record, there is a Hanukkah song.
8681000	8683000	There's actually a couple of Hanukkah songs I will listen to.
8683000	8689160	And one of them is the Maccabeats music rewrite for Candlelight.
8689160	8692920	And I will listen to Miracle because I freaking just love Matsus Yahoo anyway.
8692920	8693800	He's awesome.
8693800	8694520	Holy shit.
8694520	8697160	I didn't realize there were so many great artists on this.
8697160	8698840	They had Frankie Goes to Hollywood.
8698840	8700440	I didn't even fucking know he was on that.
8700440	8701480	That's pretty sweet.
8702680	8703720	Hans Zimmer.
8703720	8709320	I will have you know, I am getting lectured in a private message by Shane Alinko about
8709320	8712280	dissing Christmas music apparently, which I just did.
8712280	8716200	Shane Alinko, by the way, bought Skylanders on the PlayStation 4 this week just so he
8716200	8718040	could get his Christmas Skylanders character.
8718600	8719160	Just saying.
8719160	8720760	That boy is obsessed with Christmas.
8721480	8724200	I've just been ignoring all my villagers talking about Jingle.
8724840	8727720	You know, they just I'm writing down what presents they want for Toy Day.
8727720	8733240	You know, they they are selling that Skylander character separately in a couple of weeks,
8733240	8733740	by the way.
8735640	8739800	And Ikuma JP says, Oh, my God, in Japan, all Mariah Carey, all the way.
8739800	8741320	I hate shops that play that song.
8741960	8742600	Yes.
8742600	8744200	Kmart has been playing it on repeat.
8744200	8747160	And the only reason I'm going to Kmart is because it's right around the corner from
8747160	8747960	my freaking house.
8748520	8750200	And they were the only place that had long underwear.
8750200	8757400	There was another one by Boy George that that's a big favorite in Japan, too.
8758520	8760920	There's there is a Christmas trick I will listen to.
8761560	8764600	It was Pet Shop Boys all over the world.
8765800	8766300	Christmas.
8767320	8769320	Rob, you need to find that for me because I will listen to that one.
8770840	8772280	No, no more Christmas music.
8772280	8772840	What's next?
8773560	8777080	Um, kind of long email from AZHP.
8777080	8777800	I'll go ahead and read it.
8778680	8779720	He writes good stuff.
8779720	8784040	Hey, OLR crew, maybe I should like channel my mother and use the accent.
8784680	8786040	No, just read the email.
8786040	8787320	AZHP here.
8787320	8791240	I just listened to that bit at the top of this week's show where listener wrote in saying
8791240	8794600	you guys shouldn't be biased towards Sony or or against Xbox.
8795320	8796920	I think that's a lot of crap.
8798280	8801640	Anyone who has been listening to this show for any length of time knows you guys want
8801640	8803400	every console to succeed.
8803400	8806520	It would be great if every console launched issue free.
8807320	8812280	Um, had great games that you were dying to play and were controversy free.
8812920	8815880	But the problem is that's not the case.
8815880	8819960	And when passionate people like yourselves feel that a company you believed in isn't
8819960	8823240	delivering what you feel they're capable of, you respond passionately.
8823240	8826280	Loki has like four Xbox 360s.
8826280	8828840	He plays GTA 4 every day on one.
8829400	8832760	So why shouldn't he be upset that Microsoft borked the Xbox One launch?
8833400	8837800	It would be more surprising if he wasn't upset about it because he feels so passionately
8837800	8838840	about the company.
8838840	8840040	We hate because we love.
8842360	8847000	If we take it all back to the very beginnings of OLR, Konami practically could do no wrong
8847000	8852280	by us even if they never launched a better version of DDR in USA than Konami X on PS1
8852280	8854200	and DDR USA in the arcades.
8854200	8858680	That didn't stop you guys from rousing them for their disc DLC and DDR universe.
8858680	8861880	You guys imported Japanese PS2s to play DDR and 2DX.
8862440	8866600	That didn't stop you from saying that Kuraragi eats crayons for about two years after the
8866600	8867960	PS3 launched.
8867960	8870040	And let's not forget Nintendo.
8870040	8873720	As much as you guys love each Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, and Zelda game that comes out,
8873720	8878120	Nintendo's failure to understand online has always been a pain point that you go back
8878120	8883240	to again and again ever since the DS and Wii launched with friends codes and no usable
8883240	8884120	friends interface.
8886440	8886940	Hold on.
8887880	8890360	We, again, we hate because we love.
8890920	8894280	Everyone's a little bit biased, but we're biased because we know what we want in our
8894280	8897240	hearts, and when we get it, we're happy.
8897240	8900440	But when we don't get it, we're unhappy.
8900440	8901560	Thanks for reading my email.
8901560	8905320	As someone who has listened to this show on and off since its beginnings, I couldn't
8905320	8909080	sit by and watch someone leave the show just because you guys were, quote, biased.
8909080	8910200	Everyone's biased.
8910200	8911640	That's where our opinions come from.
8911640	8912200	Deal with it.
8912200	8915400	Yours truly is HP, OLR's premier gold star recipient.
8915400	8923480	Uh, thank you for remembering more than I do about the history of the show and some
8923480	8924760	of the things we said.
8924760	8928200	But my one little thing is that I think that the beginning of the email said something
8928200	8932040	like, well, I think that's crap or whatever, but let's not forget, you know, we got to
8932040	8933800	respect everybody's opinions or whatever.
8933800	8937640	And I would just hate for the person who is just trying to give honest feedback last week
8937640	8941560	to feel like, you know, like now everybody's picking on somebody for their opinion.
8941560	8942360	No, I know.
8942360	8944680	And I just want to make sure it's very clear their opinion.
8944760	8945400	Absolutely.
8945400	8945880	Absolutely.
8945880	8947720	Everybody's entitled to their opinion, period.
8947720	8950280	I just want to make that explicitly clear.
8950280	8950920	So thank you.
8952360	8953800	We can go to the next email now though.
8953800	8954040	All right.
8954040	8956600	Well, I'm asking permission if I can thank somebody on air.
8956600	8957240	Oh, okay.
8957240	8958760	Someone just did something super nice for me.
8959560	8960920	So go ahead and read this email.
8960920	8963400	Last week's opening was very thought provoking.
8963400	8967800	I don't think that OLR is centric to any specific console or platform.
8967800	8972760	I do think that many of the viewpoints we hear on OLR are representative of the core
8972760	8977560	gaming community, though not necessarily representative of the more ambiguous and
8977560	8979320	generic gaming umbrella.
8979320	8983480	The PS4 offers little to no change from what gamers have largely grown accustomed to.
8983480	8988040	It doesn't threaten the status quo and I think that it is very appealing to core gamers.
8988040	8992920	I can add to a large, I can to a large extent understand why the IR against Xbox ones is
8992920	8996360	so pervasive on gaming sites, forums, and podcasts.
8996360	9001880	Anecdotally, people who spend no time on these types of sites don't share a similar attitude.
9001880	9006040	By the way, this is written very well with great grammar, although I do miss the Oxford
9006040	9006360	comma.
9009400	9016680	As gamers, I find that our community often, and perhaps the internet in general, loves
9016680	9018920	to revel in negative news.
9018920	9022520	To that end, I can agree with the poster that it can be depressing to be inundated with
9022520	9025720	a wet blanket attitude even in the midst of a console launch.
9025720	9029400	A very rare and exciting time in my opinion.
9029400	9032680	I am not suggesting that we should ignore the negativity and also lay down a magical
9032680	9034120	rainbow while holding hands.
9034120	9035320	Dude, that sounds fun.
9035320	9036680	Only if there's sheet cake involved.
9037400	9041560	What I am saying is that we also sit back and smile once in a while with the amazing
9041560	9046600	choices we have as gamers on nearly every platform and at a variety of entry points
9046600	9047640	and simply marvel.
9048280	9052440	Every time I even think about getting bitter, my son reminds me how much he loves Mario
9052440	9057080	Cat, Super Mario 3D Land, and how he wants a Pokemon party for his next birthday and
9057080	9059960	I realize that gaming is still as great as we want it to be.
9059960	9062040	Hugs and kisses to OLR, Dark Charger.
9062040	9063400	This is an exciting time.
9063400	9067320	I agree with that in the email is that, you know, despite all the wars and disagreements
9067320	9069800	sometimes, this is a very exciting time to be a gamer.
9069800	9074200	If you think about it next year, just to put this in perspective, we're almost to 2014,
9074200	9074440	right?
9075400	9079880	Next year will mark the 12th year of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.
9079880	9085560	In the 12 years that we've been doing the show, you've had two consoles releasing in
9085560	9091160	the same month twice and one of them was this month or this past month, November.
9091160	9094360	The other time was when the PlayStation 3 and the Wii launched in the same month back
9094360	9100440	in 2006, which would have been like the second year of the podcast form of the show after
9100440	9102920	we made the switch from the DDR stuff.
9102920	9104920	So, I mean, it is an exciting time.
9104920	9107080	Moments like this don't come around very often.
9107080	9112680	And I think from E3, this whole conversation has been very charged.
9112760	9117480	What was very different about last time is that when it was Sony and Nintendo launching
9117480	9122040	in the same month, you know, everybody was hazing Sony because, oh, Sony's looking like
9122040	9123880	a bunch of crayon eaters right now.
9123880	9125880	And wow, Nintendo's kind of doing something different.
9125880	9129960	I mean, that was the mindset of the internet, quote unquote, back then.
9129960	9135640	Now, I mean, sure, you've got your Xbox and your Sony fanboys and Gran and Microsoft made
9135640	9138040	a lot of missteps at E3.
9138040	9143640	But what really was different this time was Sony calling them out.
9144280	9146280	That was a key difference.
9146280	9150680	And that's caused there to be a little more sting in this whole war.
9150680	9157080	I think you can trace that back to that very moment when Sony made the YouTube of how to
9157080	9161160	play used games on the PlayStation 4, where one dude handed the game to the other.
9162440	9167160	I mean, I know we're not quite to the point where we look at back on the biggest news
9167160	9171080	stories of the year, but I would say the release of that YouTube was the biggest news
9171080	9172360	story of 2013.
9172360	9175880	I'll probably end up saying that again at the end of the year was when Sony themselves
9175880	9180280	put out a video of how to trade a used game on the PlayStation 4, because that was just
9180280	9185320	that you didn't see that last gen, that kind of slapping, basically.
9185320	9187080	Anyhow, DarkSaga.
9188200	9190440	I am defending my love of Digimon 02.
9191880	9192440	Random.
9192440	9193800	But only the Japanese version.
9193800	9195000	I really liked that one.
9195000	9195960	The movies were great.
9195960	9201160	Anyway, this one comes from Ye Olde Reginator.
9202200	9205080	Hi, oh, you know, by the way, you know how that began the Ye Olde thing?
9206200	9206920	Typography.
9207720	9211640	There used to be a letter that they did not have a type for, and it looked very similar
9211640	9213400	to the Y, so they used that.
9213400	9215160	And that's why we have Ye Olde and not The Olde.
9215160	9216680	Let's get to Ye Olde next email.
9216680	9217560	Hi, OLR crew.
9217560	9218840	It's Reginator again.
9218840	9221480	I just thought I'd post some random questions this week.
9221480	9225720	One, I've noticed that as of the PS2 Xbox GameCube generation of consoles, unlike
9225720	9229960	previous generations, console generation stopped being referred to as being the insert
9229960	9232200	number here bit console or generation.
9232200	9233400	Why the drop in the practice?
9233400	9238440	It seems to me that the practice is a quick, easy, and easily understandable way to refer
9238440	9242920	to a generation of consoles, rather than going the long-winded route of saying something
9242920	9245400	like the 360 slash PS3 slash Wii generation.
9247400	9251480	Number two, with Steam's Winter Sale presumably starting within the next few days, what games
9251480	9255560	do the three of you think should be on everyone's radar and should be bought if it
9255560	9256280	goes on sale?
9259320	9263320	Well, there was a game on my list, but Codeman got it for me.
9263320	9263640	Oh.
9263640	9265560	So I'm going to be playing Skullgirls when I get home.
9265560	9266520	Oh, nice.
9266520	9267080	Lucky you.
9267080	9267560	That's great.
9267560	9268280	Lucky me.
9268280	9268680	Thank you.
9268680	9269000	Thank you.
9269000	9270040	He's a nice boy.
9270040	9270600	He is.
9271800	9277320	To be fair, I gave him a little gift on behalf of the show earlier this week.
9277320	9279960	So I'm glad to see he's paying it forward.
9279960	9280760	That's very kind.
9282920	9284280	What else was I going to say with that?
9284280	9287160	So what Steam games should Rage Nator be on the lookout for?
9287160	9288760	Is that basically the gist of what I'm hearing?
9288760	9291160	Well, what we are on the lookout for, I guess.
9291160	9294600	I'm probably going to get Final Fantasy 13 because it should be out by then.
9295240	9296040	On PC?
9296040	9296600	Yeah.
9296600	9298360	They were saying that there should be a PC release.
9298360	9299320	I didn't know they were doing a PC release.
9299320	9299720	I thought there was.
9299720	9300200	Are you sure?
9300200	9301560	I think I read it somewhere.
9301560	9303560	I think it would have been out by now if that was the case.
9303560	9306600	Okay, well then Dan's the one that told me about it, so.
9307400	9308520	What have I been keeping my eye on?
9308520	9312120	I ended up buying Stanley Parable was something I was going to get, and I did get that.
9312120	9313400	Gone Home I ended up getting.
9313400	9314920	Spelunky I ended up getting.
9314920	9319240	Like all the games I had on my watch list, I ended up getting this past sale.
9320360	9325160	If Final Fantasy 8 goes on sale, I will buy it for the sole purpose of giving it another chance,
9325160	9330120	especially with this thing that Loki was talking about where he can fix the magic system and only
9330120	9332920	have to draw once, even if it's cheating, quote unquote.
9334520	9337800	I think that's how I played through the game now that I think about it.
9337800	9339560	I'll probably get it too if it goes on sale.
9339560	9340680	Yeah, that's one I'd be looking forward to.
9340680	9345560	I don't know why I, you know what, I did look this up, and it wasn't 13,
9345560	9348920	but Dan had mentioned something to me, and I think I had it stuck in my head.
9349640	9352360	But I almost picked it up for Xbox, but.
9355240	9359080	I'm trying to, I'm actually loading up Steam right now to see if there's anything that
9359080	9362200	jumps out of my mind as like something I was waiting on to get.
9362200	9364280	Officially released Just Cause 2 multiplayer.
9366760	9368040	It's not on Steam, but Grand Theft Auto 5.
9368040	9371240	Hotline Miami is on sale right now, which I have and is fun.
9371240	9373160	I think I got that in an indie bundle.
9373160	9375720	I completely forgot for that for my gaming week.
9375720	9377560	I actually started playing Hotline Miami.
9377560	9379960	I forgot my gaming week.
9379960	9382520	Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed was free this weekend on Steam,
9382520	9384120	and I played that too because it was free.
9384120	9384620	Yeah.
9385080	9386840	So it's on sale right now too.
9386840	9390440	Honestly, Ragenator, I think everything I wanted, I really bought in this last sale.
9390440	9393480	I'm sure there will be more indie games that I see little screenshots of,
9393480	9394600	and I'll be like, Ooh, I want that.
9394600	9395320	Ooh, I want that.
9395320	9399560	There are a couple that appealed to me, but I think for right now,
9399560	9401320	like that Ringrunner one actually looked interesting.
9403320	9407560	But for right now, I still have the Shiva to play.
9407560	9409560	I have now I have Skullgirls to play.
9409560	9410920	I have Deadpool to play.
9410920	9411720	Yeah.
9411720	9414840	So you're probably never going to see me on Final Fantasy again,
9414840	9416200	because I don't know if there's shit to play.
9417880	9420440	But then patch 2.1 will hit and it'll be like, Ooh.
9420440	9425160	I need to just freaking get past level 31 so that I can do that stupid
9425160	9429560	quest that I'm stuck on, my Arkanis job quest.
9430360	9431080	Anyway, whatever.
9431960	9434920	Three, Final Fantasy VIII's recent release on Steam.
9434920	9437320	Yay, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, meh.
9437320	9439240	Or Final Fantasy VIII, fuck that shit.
9440120	9441320	I think we just answered that question.
9442440	9445800	I don't, I mean, I realized there was a little bit of a Twitter debate
9445800	9449960	earlier this week that I got caught up in, and I kind of started it, so I deserve it.
9449960	9454680	But I don't despise Final Fantasy VIII by many means.
9454760	9459720	I just feel a few key flaws in that game really ruin the fun.
9459720	9464360	And so I don't remember it as fondly as the others, but it has a good story.
9464360	9468520	I mean, you know, it's, and it was especially considering you could have
9468520	9472360	made a game that was very similar to VII when VII did so well, but they didn't.
9472360	9474360	And they went a very different direction with the story.
9474360	9475960	And I do applaud them for that.
9475960	9481560	So I'm trying to be nice y'all, but it's, it's still the worst Final
9481560	9483480	Fantasy game next to 14, 1.0.
9483480	9484200	I'm sorry.
9484200	9485000	It's just how I feel.
9485000	9485400	Opinions.
9485400	9485880	I have them.
9485880	9490120	By the way, they did bring up the Tamagotchi and handheld Digimon.
9490120	9493480	They were both brought out by Bandai, which the Tamagotchi came out first.
9493480	9495080	Then Digimon came so that you could battle.
9495080	9502360	I had the little ones, the handheld LED, or not LED, but LCD Digimon battler things.
9502360	9507720	And then I was like, I think I remembered naming my, because I evolved to Devimon first.
9507720	9509400	And I remember calling him Satan Common.
9510600	9511560	That was his name.
9511560	9513080	And I was, thought I would name a dog that.
9513640	9517960	For, I'm thinking of establishing a weekly Vognite on Counter-Strike Global Offensive
9517960	9519000	on Steam.
9519000	9523480	I know that unlike TF2, it isn't free, but it will likely be on sale soon.
9524200	9528120	Would, would, would be, there are any takers?
9528680	9535480	It was actually just on sale recently and I did pick it up, because it means that I
9535480	9539080	have pretty much the entirety of the, the first party Valve pack.
9539080	9542120	I have literally everything they have ever released first party.
9543160	9544920	Mine is Left 4 Dead, one and two.
9546040	9547080	So nevermind.
9547080	9549080	This email is brought to you by Star Fox 64.
9549080	9549800	Do a barrel roll.
9551160	9555800	And last email, which by the way, we did have one from YYR, but I.
9555800	9556760	He said he'd call later.
9556760	9558600	I have paid attention to the chat.
9558600	9559000	Yes.
9559000	9561640	And I'm honoring the previous statement.
9561640	9562200	All right.
9562200	9563160	Live is better.
9563160	9564360	Hi, O.L.R. Crew.
9564360	9565080	I said hi.
9566040	9567400	Firstly, that's what it says here.
9568120	9571000	Firstly, thank you all for giving me a theme song.
9571000	9576360	Sky made a great choice with conga feeling, though I'm waiting for the day he screws
9576360	9579000	up and plays Miami Sound Machines conga by accident.
9581000	9581960	Wait, I got a better one.
9581960	9582920	I got an even better one.
9582920	9583640	Give it a minute.
9583640	9584280	Keep, keep going.
9584280	9585560	I'll play a theme song here at the end.
9586440	9587880	But enough about you guys.
9587880	9589320	I'm here to ask your pal Jason.
9590280	9594440	One, since Jason is now doing intros, is he being paid in peanuts or Oreos?
9594440	9595560	I did give him a candy cane.
9596520	9597800	He drinks some of our juice.
9598760	9603320	He's being paid in love and high fives.
9603320	9609960	I am being paid in involvement, which has been it's what it's legitimately wonderful
9609960	9610440	to do.
9610440	9616760	We said, Jason, if you'll help us out, we will give you what we get from doing the show.
9616760	9617480	We will match.
9617480	9621080	I get an equal share of what we get.
9621080	9621800	That's what he gets.
9625560	9626520	Okay, back to the email.
9627400	9630120	Has Jason introduced OLR to the Game Grumps web show?
9630840	9631640	I've heard of it.
9632680	9634120	I know of Game Grumps.
9634120	9638360	I know I have name dropped it and similar channels that I follow once or twice.
9638360	9640440	And I'm pretty sure I've even worn a shirt out here.
9641320	9646760	And not, not that I of course have any, I don't, I don't have any connection to any
9646760	9652280	of these other shows except as a fan, but I do have some ideas of things that I think
9652280	9654920	could be kind of pretty fantastic.
9654920	9658200	But we'll see if I can actually get in touch with people and make things happen.
9658200	9658440	Okay.
9658440	9659800	I'm like, I don't want to rip anything off.
9659800	9660280	Certainly.
9660280	9661000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
9661000	9666680	Certainly like no, no promises to speak of, but I consume a hell of a lot of content and
9667320	9670360	you know, so many of these things take place in California anyway.
9670360	9674280	So it's a little bit more doable and not just something by Skype.
9674280	9675320	I have ideas.
9675320	9681320	Well, Hey, since we're on the topic, um, what video shows do you like other than Game Grumps?
9681320	9683560	Um, I like, I like Game Sack.
9683560	9688840	Another one of my sources for news, like the first couple of times I did the intro is that,
9688840	9690920	um, she goes by Dodger.
9690920	9692360	She has two different channels.
9692360	9696040	Uh, her gaming channel all the time is Press Heart to Continue.
9696040	9701400	And she does a news show on Saturday nights that I usually try to follow to take in more
9701400	9702440	content as well.
9702440	9707400	Uh, the Polaris Network, just in general, I drop in, see whatever videos catch my eye
9707400	9710200	and then, and then, you know, move on to something else.
9710200	9713400	Um, Game Grumps, uh, uh, uh, crap.
9713400	9714360	What's his name?
9714360	9715000	Gerard.
9715000	9716440	Uh, JK completes it.
9716440	9719000	Um, Markiplier.
9719000	9721880	I've been watching quite a, quite a lot of his stuff lately.
9721880	9730200	And I feel like, Oh, Continue show, um, does, uh, it not, not a let's play, not a review,
9730200	9735720	but Hey, let's play a game and publish a video of the Memorial moments.
9735720	9739640	30, 30 minutes or so of a game, uh, updates every Wednesday.
9739640	9743400	They've been there in, uh, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, uh, and they're pretty fun to
9743400	9743880	watch too.
9743880	9746920	So most of the stuff I like are the review ones, like classic game room.
9747720	9749320	And, uh, I really like Game Sack.
9749320	9751720	They're a newer one and game theory.
9751720	9752840	I don't watch anything.
9752840	9753640	I don't, I really don't.
9753640	9756600	I actually, I actually do not watch review things.
9756600	9758760	I watch like active content things.
9758760	9765320	Every single person that I just named does plays a game and either voiceover afterwards
9765320	9767640	or running commentary while they're playing the game.
9767640	9772040	And I just want to clarify, like, I just, I support indie broadcasting and people, you
9772040	9774440	know, doing it, but it's just like, I'm too busy.
9775320	9778280	I like to do watch the stuff my friends do because a lot of my friends are doing live
9778280	9778520	streaming.
9778520	9784040	So I do a lot of that and I'm too busy producing, but to be honest, I think I honestly, I think
9784040	9785480	of my favorites right now.
9785480	9791080	I'd really have to go for game theory because I like the fact that it breaks apart and analyzes.
9791080	9795320	I did just catch that the other day because link dead one.
9795320	9799160	No, uh, uh, Mario, uh, Mario's affliction.
9799160	9803080	I can't remember the name, but basically the fact that he's actually kind of the antihero
9803080	9806280	in like the, the legitimate lore and everything in my universe.
9807000	9811240	So anyway, um, to go ahead and close up this email, since that was the last thing that's
9811240	9811480	it.
9811480	9812040	Have a good night.
9812040	9812920	The nasty canasta.
9813720	9815480	Oh, and here for nasty canasta.
9819640	9823480	This is Conga for BeatMania 2DX4 style by Good Cool.
9825320	9826680	Yeah, I told you I have something better.
9826680	9828040	This one's fun to play too.
9828040	9829080	Nasty canasta.
9830760	9831080	All right.
9831720	9832120	Anyhow.
9832680	9832920	Ha.
9832920	9834760	See, I'm not the only one that likes game theory.
9835400	9840440	I tried it one time while back to mix conga and conga feeling together.
9840440	9841160	It doesn't work.
9841160	9841880	It doesn't work.
9841880	9842600	It doesn't work.
9842600	9843880	I miss your remixes, Loki.
9845960	9846200	All right.
9846200	9847000	Is that it for emails?
9847560	9847880	Yes.
9847880	9848760	Oh, well then there you go.
9848760	9850600	Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com.
9850600	9852520	Now he's busy with genetic mixes.
9852600	9857480	Is the place to mailbag at orangelauntrader.com is the place to send emails.
9857480	9858760	That would be fantastic.
9859720	9864520	In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week because, you know, we're angsty
9864520	9865160	some of the time.
9865720	9866440	A lot of the time.
9867320	9867800	All the time.
9882520	9889160	So I have to do a little bit of a story and then, um, I will say a big FU to this jerkface.
9889720	9893880	I was going to target and some people on my Facebook and Tumblr know about this.
9893880	9897960	So I was going to target and there's this big guy just smoking in front of the door,
9897960	9898840	blocking the path.
9899560	9901480	And I was like, eh.
9901480	9904840	So I tried to walk around him and he kept putting himself in my way.
9904840	9907560	So I just scooted on around cause I'm shorter and faster.
9907560	9910600	And he tried to grab my arm going into the target.
9910600	9912040	And I mean, this guy's bigger than Dan.
9913160	9915400	I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm about to go off.
9915400	9916360	So finish your story.
9916360	9920280	Well, and he speaks in this whiskey voice, you know, the whiskey chain smoker voice.
9920280	9925800	And then, so he tries to grab my arm and I pulled back and I said, I meant to say Neanderthal
9925800	9929880	and I called him Neolithic, but I said, don't touch me, you Neolithic sack of shit.
9931480	9936840	Because I was by that point angry because someone trying to grab me is illegal.
9937560	9941160	Apart from that, it's something that sets me off immediately.
9941160	9942280	Who, who does that?
9943000	9944360	This is not high school.
9944360	9945240	This is not a bully.
9945240	9946520	This is an adult.
9946520	9950360	You don't grab somebody at random outside of target.
9950360	9956200	To quote my friend who I discussed this with, she's like, he's the type of person who thinks
9956200	9957160	that women are property.
9958760	9960760	It's, it's, it's disgusting.
9960760	9966440	So just going into this, basically what happens that by the time I got inside the building,
9966440	9969640	after I said this to him, I just kept dashing back on into the building.
9969640	9972200	He is going to get maced and good.
9972280	9975480	He is going to, he's going to grab the wrong person and he is going to be maced.
9975480	9978040	Well, I'm going to tell you just knowing the way that I react to things.
9978040	9984600	Had he touched me, I probably would have completely lost my shit because I, without going into
9984600	9990520	too much detail about my own past, I have lost my shit before when someone grabbed me
9990520	9992440	and it didn't end pretty anyway.
9992440	9993080	Oh, sorry.
9993080	9994920	I didn't loop the FU is okay.
9995560	9999880	So, so I was too busy being, and I'm short enough and he's tall enough that if I had,
9999880	10000280	I punched him.
10000280	10001160	I would have punched him in the deck.
10001160	10006120	So anyway, so I, I scooted inside target and he's yelling after me.
10007000	10008120	Come back here, midget.
10012120	10013560	But that's all he could say.
10013560	10017960	And I was like, and it just, I, cause I was so angry and so worked up.
10017960	10019560	I would have called the police.
10019560	10023960	Actually, if I had been with you, I, Oh, it would have gone down as a target parking lot.
10024920	10026360	Well, I, let's put it this way.
10026360	10032360	I was, I was so worked up and so angry and so fucking close to a full-blown meltdown
10032360	10035480	that I let it out the only way I could think of, which was hysterical laughter.
10036200	10038040	Just laughing my ass off.
10038040	10040760	And this guy outside of here, he goes, man, she's laughing at you.
10040760	10043000	And he's like, come back here midget are you laughing at me?
10043000	10046920	I was like, that's better is almost better than the physical punching in the deck because
10047880	10049480	I publicly, you know, humiliated him.
10049480	10050440	And that was pretty funny too.
10051080	10054520	So, um, so, and thank you, Alan.
10054520	10055000	I love you.
10055080	10057800	You said, um, it's because dark soccer had the ball to be a woman in public.
10059960	10064920	So basically once I calmed down and had a fun conversation with the lady in the sock department
10064920	10067880	and you know how she's like, yeah, I saw him out there.
10067880	10070680	I tried to teach my son never to be like that.
10070680	10072040	And I was like, bless you.
10072040	10075720	You know, and they ended up escorting the guys off the property.
10075720	10080200	And I think they did the cops, but I stayed inside the Walmart, not Walmart, the target
10080920	10082360	for a solid hour.
10082360	10085640	And you know, what was even worse about that is that the Hanukkah stuff wasn't on sale yet.
10087960	10092760	So anyway, so I just ended up just wandering around and looking at stuff and looking at
10092760	10097320	toys and playing on the internet on my phone and finally left.
10097320	10102040	And though I have to say that leaving the place is like that sort of, there's like a
10102040	10106760	layer of calm that comes when you're in that heightened state where you observe everything
10106760	10109400	and nothing escapes attention.
10109400	10111880	I've gotten in my car and the freak out started happening.
10111960	10115160	And by the time I got home, I was in full blown freak out mode.
10115160	10117560	I could barely say anything to anybody.
10117560	10119640	And even the cat wouldn't come near me.
10119640	10121560	And when Dan came home, I just lost my shit.
10121560	10129320	So, but in that situation, no, fuck him and fuck every man like him in the universe.
10129320	10130520	This is why we need feminism.
10132120	10133240	Moving on Loki.
10134040	10134680	All right.
10134680	10135880	Well, I only have one.
10135880	10139720	That's the fact I have to get my wisdom teeth out.
10140520	10140920	Damn it.
10140920	10142920	I thought I was determined to be wise.
10148200	10150120	I don't really have a lot to F you.
10150120	10153480	So F you to my snacking habit is out of control.
10154360	10155480	Do you like your candy cane?
10155480	10155960	I did.
10155960	10159240	I ate the whole damn thing because I have a habit.
10159240	10159880	I love food.
10160680	10164760	Jason, I had one sometime this week, but I had a really good week.
10164760	10165560	I'm not angsty.
10166920	10168920	F you to Jason for not having angst.
10169720	10170040	All right.
10170920	10175720	Uh, just a couple of just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line
10175720	10180040	at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype, orange lounge radio.
10180040	10181240	Let's try to run through these quick.
10181240	10181800	All right.
10181800	10188360	So Tari, maybe on the back or coming back, uh, they have finally, um, received court
10188360	10190680	approval to come out of bankruptcy.
10190680	10197320	Um, they, I guess they have a payment plan now that involves a payback at 3.8 million
10197320	10199560	owned to the bankruptcy lender.
10199640	10204280	And, uh, once they have that and they're operating on their own, they can start paying, I guess,
10204280	10210760	1.75 million to, um, you know, different creditors over the course of three years.
10210760	10216680	And, uh, apparently that's a small portion of the over 10 million that they're owned.
10216680	10219080	Um, but Hey, that'd be good.
10219080	10222680	Cause, uh, at least it's not a studio, another studio going under.
10224840	10226840	Maybe they'll make another aluminum, the dark game.
10226920	10228040	Oh, it's a this crap.
10230600	10231160	All right.
10231160	10233000	Uh, well, good luck to Atari.
10233000	10233400	All right.
10233400	10235000	Uh, one other story for you guys.
10235000	10237960	And as I promised, we would do a story about pornography.
10237960	10242440	And, uh, this is a story from a website that really needs to consider their ad model because
10242440	10243560	it's just annoying.
10243560	10246200	And, uh, this is why people get ad blockers destructoid.
10246200	10252120	But anyway, destructoid ran this story about, uh, what Pornhub, uh, had to say about, uh,
10252120	10255080	pornography on the various consoles that are out there.
10255080	10259640	And a destructoid actually called Pornhub or emailed or whatever people do to talk to
10259640	10260360	each other.
10260360	10266360	And, uh, the Pornhub vice president, Corey Price, I don't know what he's vice president
10266360	10267480	of, I guess just porn.
10267480	10271640	Uh, so the vice president of porn said, quote, Pornhub is targeting consoles for website
10271640	10275240	support because that is where some of our users today prefer to access our site.
10275240	10278760	And our aim is to offer a great user experience across all platforms.
10279320	10283160	Now, the stuff you really want to know, where are people watching their pornography?
10283160	10288440	Because you know, the PS3, the PS4, the Wii, the 360, they all can, you know, have the
10288440	10290600	internet and therefore you can get porn on it.
10291160	10294200	Um, yes, a Nintendo console, the Wii can get porn.
10295080	10301000	Um, anyhow, so the majority of porn, Pornhub traffic comes from the PlayStation 3.
10301000	10305560	55% of pornography comes from the PlayStation 3.
10305560	10313000	Uh, the Xbox 360 accounts for 39% and the Wii, as this website calls it, a limp
10313000	10313320	6%.
10314840	10317240	That's just because have you tried internet on the land?
10317240	10318440	It's awful.
10318440	10319000	So true.
10319560	10321800	And technically though, it does work though.
10322600	10323160	What?
10323160	10325560	The internet on the way to bring up porn.
10325560	10326280	It does.
10326280	10327000	I remember.
10327000	10327960	We've done that.
10327960	10328600	Yes.
10328600	10330600	It was research purposes, of course.
10331480	10333640	Anyway, so congratulations PlayStation 3.
10333640	10336200	You are the Kings and Queens of pornography.
10336200	10336700	Yay.
10337640	10340440	Let's go to the phones at one eight seven seven game.
10341000	10343880	Or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
10343880	10344280	Hello.
10344280	10345400	You're on orange launch radio.
10345400	10345880	Who's this?
10346600	10347240	Am I now?
10347800	10348920	This is Y Y R.
10348920	10349640	Hi, you're on.
10349640	10351000	Greetings and salutations.
10351000	10351960	And I love your shirt.
10351960	10353000	This is video.
10354520	10355880	We're getting a video call.
10355880	10356840	Are you seeing this?
10356840	10358120	Did you see it zoom in?
10358120	10359000	Yeah, like zoom.
10359000	10360600	This is an Xbox call, isn't it?
10361320	10363800	Yes, this is I'm calling you for my Xbox one.
10363800	10369640	And now let me show you basically either one of the coolest or most creepy things that
10369640	10373080	the Xbox one will do as you say, God is following you.
10373800	10375320	Yes, it is following me.
10375320	10377080	It will follow you around the room.
10377080	10380360	It will basically like, if you walk out of view, it's going to be like confused.
10380360	10381400	Oh God, where did he go?
10381400	10381880	Oh my God.
10381880	10384520	It's how clean that mess up off your table.
10384520	10386120	It's going to zoom in on my face.
10386120	10386680	Sorry.
10386680	10387240	That's all right.
10389160	10390600	Give me some wheat thins, bro.
10393560	10396360	You cannot have my wheat thins.
10396360	10396860	All right.
10397420	10398780	Well, congratulations.
10398780	10398940	Why?
10398940	10404460	Why are you are the first, uh, Xbox one caller to the call to the show.
10404460	10406060	So can I, can I troll you?
10406940	10407500	I'm sorry.
10407500	10409420	You have to see my messy living room.
10409420	10414140	I was actually thinking about cleaning it up or this call, but that's all right.
10414140	10414460	Wait, wait.
10414460	10415580	Can I try something real quick?
10415580	10417100	Why do I try something real quick?
10417100	10417660	Okay, hold on.
10418300	10420300	Xbox power down.
10421500	10425420	No, by the way, it's not power down.
10425420	10427660	Oh, it's turn off now.
10427660	10428780	Xbox turn off.
10430060	10431580	Don't listen to rob Xbox.
10432380	10434060	He'll deceive you every time.
10434060	10435180	He'll lead you astray.
10435900	10436300	All right.
10436300	10437420	No, it's interesting.
10437420	10442860	I actually have a feeling that it somehow can differentiate between voices in the room
10442860	10449580	and voices from the speaker because my girlfriend already tried this and it didn't work out
10449580	10450460	all that well.
10450460	10451340	Didn't work out.
10451340	10454940	So you're, uh, making Xbox one video calls to your girlfriend, huh?
10455820	10457740	Uh, yes, actually what's interesting.
10457740	10462060	Um, I was cleaning up my place for the last two days and listening to the last two weeks
10462060	10463260	worth of OLR.
10463260	10465740	And I see you mentioned that you're in San Francisco a lot.
10465740	10466780	Well, guess where she lives?
10467420	10468380	San Francisco.
10469020	10473420	So, uh, we may, depending on what happens, we may need to make some plans to, you know,
10473420	10476380	me chill out because she's actually listening right now.
10476380	10477740	So she'll know who you are.
10477740	10479500	Do you, oh, well, howdy.
10479500	10481500	Where, where, when are you coming to San Francisco?
10481500	10485180	Cause, cause our, our buddy Jason is in San Francisco for the holidays.
10486060	10490780	Oh, well, I mean, I'm going to visit her for a few days on the 19th, but I'm not sticking
10490780	10491660	around for very long.
10491660	10495100	Cause I'm, I basically used up all of my vacation this year.
10495100	10495820	Nope.
10495820	10497980	Well, uh, look, look up VX chase next week.
10497980	10498940	Cause he's in us.
10498940	10500220	He's said Seattle.
10500220	10500780	What the hell?
10500780	10502220	He's in San Francisco right now.
10502220	10503180	Keep in touch anyways.
10503180	10504380	Let's see if we can work something out.
10504380	10504780	There you go.
10505660	10506620	That's cool.
10506620	10511180	So I'm listening to OLR over the weekend and by the way, um, how's the audio?
10511180	10511820	Is it coming through?
10511820	10512300	Okay.
10512300	10512780	It's good.
10513340	10517660	You can tell that your, your microphone, like you're not talking into a microphone that
10517660	10521180	it's like a room microphone that has a big gate, but it's, it's fine.
10521180	10522060	It's, it's good enough.
10522060	10522380	Okay.
10522380	10524060	So I shouldn't try plugging this in.
10524700	10527180	I'd be curious just to see what the quality difference is.
10528060	10528300	Okay.
10528300	10528940	Well, you know what?
10528940	10531020	I'll plug in my, uh, a little mic here.
10531020	10532940	He's plugging in a little microservices.
10532940	10534140	Is there still a radio show?
10534140	10537260	We might all be looking at video, but I know the podcast listeners can't see it.
10537260	10537660	Okay.
10537660	10538780	Uh, can you hear me now?
10538780	10539660	Oh, that sounds okay.
10539660	10541340	That sounds like a normal call now.
10541340	10541820	Yeah.
10541820	10543100	I think I lost you.
10543100	10543740	No, we're here.
10543740	10544700	Hi, still there.
10544700	10545020	Yes.
10545020	10545740	You sound great.
10545740	10546700	So talk.
10546700	10547340	God damn it.
10548140	10550140	And this become old can't became a one week.
10550140	10550940	Oh my God.
10550940	10554620	Yeah, that's too bad because he sounds better on that thing.
10554620	10559900	I had to suppress the urge to reach out my hand and say, turn the volume up in sign language,
10559900	10560940	but we don't have a camera.
10560940	10561900	We don't have a cam in here.
10561900	10563260	Maybe I need to go get one.
10563260	10563580	What are you?
10563580	10568220	He's pressing buttons and I see the lights in his room, like fluctuating, like he's
10568220	10569980	running through different screens.
10569980	10570300	All right.
10570300	10571340	Well, I just thought plugged it.
10571420	10572380	Can you hear me now?
10572380	10572620	Yeah.
10572620	10574940	We could actually hear you before and you sounded great.
10574940	10575420	Yeah.
10575420	10576060	Huh?
10576060	10577500	Now he can't hear us at all.
10577500	10578540	You lost it entirely.
10580140	10581260	This is exciting.
10581260	10581900	Why?
10581900	10582380	Uh, maybe.
10582380	10583180	Oh, you don't know what else?
10583180	10583740	Let's see.
10583740	10583980	Okay.
10583980	10584540	He hung up.
10587740	10589820	Xbox one y'all wave of the future.
10591180	10591900	He's calling back.
10592540	10592780	Okay.
10592780	10593900	He's calling back right now.
10597500	10600140	Well, I would have to say that was absolutely a success.
10601660	10604060	We can hear you fine that whole time.
10604060	10604780	Just so you know.
10604780	10605420	Oh, really?
10605420	10605660	Yes.
10606940	10607180	Yeah.
10607180	10610380	Because the, yeah, I absolutely stopped hearing you.
10610380	10613580	I tried unplugging the mic and I still couldn't hear you.
10613580	10615660	So yeah, that didn't work out so well.
10615660	10618780	Just $4.99 at your local Walmart or Target.
10618780	10621020	$499 US dollars.
10622060	10622860	All right.
10622860	10623740	What else is on your mind?
10623740	10625260	You send an email to the show, right?
10625900	10626140	Yeah.
10626140	10630940	Basically after listening, you know, I'm listening to a six, seven hours worth of
10631580	10635100	and of course there were a few times when I'm just like, oh, I wish I was in chat so I
10635100	10636700	could respond to things.
10636700	10639900	But there were three things in particular that I wanted to bring up.
10641580	10646220	The subject of the discontinuation of spot pass service for swap note was brought up
10646220	10648300	at least four separate times.
10648300	10648620	Okay.
10649500	10651900	And I wanted to throw in my two cents on that.
10653020	10656540	And because at first I thought also, why, why did they do that?
10656540	10660140	Why couldn't they just drop the photo feature and leave the rest of it intact?
10660940	10667420	But I thought about it for a while and then I understood this had to be done because swap
10667420	10675660	note, unfortunately put kids and teens in touch with people who could, you know, take
10675660	10677660	their pictures and do bad things with them.
10678460	10685340	And if they had just dropped the photo feature, it would have left these kids and teens with
10685340	10687980	a way to communicate with their potential abusers.
10688540	10692540	At which point the potential abusers could just say, oh, well now send your pictures
10692540	10696460	to this email address or send your pictures to this phone or things like that.
10696460	10703020	It could have gone from there by completely pulling the plug that, you know, kills that
10703020	10703660	idea.
10703660	10704380	It stops it.
10705820	10710860	My biggest problem though, YYR is that, that why are kids, how come the kids are talking
10710860	10713020	to these people unsupervised in the first place?
10713020	10717660	Like, you know, if, if a parent is concerned about it, why is, why is swap note even being
10717660	10718780	downloaded in the first place?
10718780	10722860	I think if the parents were more involved, then you wouldn't have this happen.
10722860	10727900	And it, this isn't something that's, I mean, this is horrible and we do need to stop predators
10727900	10729500	from predating on children.
10729500	10735100	But disabled, disabling swap note is not going to do that because there's always email, there's
10735100	10736380	always the internet and other forms.
10736380	10738060	They found each other somehow.
10738060	10744540	So I just kind of feel like, you know, well, why, I don't understand.
10744540	10745660	So it strikes me as a parent.
10745660	10747660	You are absolutely preaching to the choir.
10747660	10752220	I completely agree with you that parents need to be more hands on about what their kids
10752220	10753180	and teens are doing.
10753180	10757180	But for the moments that they're not, you know, Nintendo being as family friendly as
10757180	10760460	they want to be, that is what they chose to do.
10760460	10762460	And I, I understand it.
10762460	10768940	It sucks, but I can understand that decision because they needed to cut off the, you know,
10768940	10770700	the contact between these two parties.
10771740	10776220	It just, it just also further goes to show why we're never going to have video play on
10776220	10777180	the virtual console.
10777180	10780300	And I just think that's the wrong direction for Nintendo in general.
10780300	10781900	It just, it sucks for the rest of us.
10781900	10784140	And I, yeah, it does.
10784140	10784940	But you know what?
10784940	10787020	I think that just comes with the territory.
10787020	10789500	I was, you know, gaming on a Nintendo platform.
10790220	10792460	We're just going to have to do those things on other platforms.
10793740	10798140	Well, I think Nintendo's other thing too is that just because a parent should do something,
10798140	10800700	they know not all parents will do something.
10800700	10802860	So it keeps their reputation safe.
10803420	10805180	They have their brand to look after.
10805180	10805980	Exactly.
10805980	10806540	Exactly.
10807900	10812940	So the, anyway, the second thing I wanted to bring up was Forza 5 microtransactions.
10812940	10816860	You know, it seems like you guys don't think it's a really big deal, but I'm going to give
10816860	10820140	you three reasons why folks are up in arms about it.
10820860	10826460	Number one, in older Forza games, by playing through the game and completing the challenges
10826460	10829980	or whatever, occasionally you would get cars for free.
10829980	10832620	Hey, you cleared this thing, you get this car.
10832620	10834700	They don't do that anymore in 5.
10835340	10842780	You cannot earn cars by any means except buying them with credits or tokens, except for the
10842780	10846460	very first car you get when you start the game, because how can you drive without one?
10846940	10851100	So it's not like what we were just saying about Gran Turismo 6, where you just unlock
10851100	10852140	them through the course of the story.
10852140	10855180	Anyway, I had the impression that these two games are in very similar boats.
10856540	10858860	You have to buy all of the cars now.
10858860	10860380	At least that's what I've read online.
10860380	10862140	I just started playing the game myself.
10862140	10866060	I haven't really gotten to, you know, a point where I would want to buy another car yet.
10866060	10870780	But from what I've been reading in Amazon reviews and Game Facts posts and other places,
10870780	10874460	there are no free cars anymore except the one you get at the start.
10874460	10875980	You have to buy everything.
10876060	10878220	Now, ready for your mind to be blown?
10879340	10881260	This is how DLC cars work.
10881260	10882460	This is item number two.
10883580	10885900	You pay real money for the DLC, yes?
10888060	10893980	When you do this, this adds the cars to the game, but you cannot actually drive the cars
10893980	10896700	until you buy them from the in-game shop.
10899260	10903260	And if you don't have enough credits to do that, you get to open your wallet again and
10903260	10905980	essentially pay twice to use these cars.
10907100	10907600	Huh.
10908540	10909040	Yep.
10909980	10910780	I'm waiting.
10910780	10914460	I'm really hoping somebody in the chat room here is going to jump in and say you're wrong.
10914460	10915980	Like, no offense, but I just-
10915980	10917180	I would hope so too.
10917180	10918140	That would be great.
10918140	10920140	I hope someone tells me that.
10920140	10923740	Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf went to bed, and I know he's been playing the game, so-
10923740	10925500	He said the exact same thing, though, on his show.
10925500	10925980	Really?
10925980	10926380	I want to say, yeah.
10928060	10930620	Well, you know, here's the thing.
10930620	10935100	Number three item, which basically makes one and two worse, is credits are earned slower
10935100	10937580	in the game than they were in Forza 4, so-
10937580	10944700	I will give this little thing, and that is that, okay, well, there's a lot of DLC that
10944700	10949740	you download that you can't really play until you get to a certain point in the game, but
10949740	10953900	I don't know, something just seems really, really tacky about it.
10953900	10954620	Super tacky.
10954620	10957820	DKBeast in chat at live.vognetware.com says he's not wrong.
10957820	10959420	Wow.
10959420	10962300	Yeah, I was really hoping I would be, but no.
10963020	10965420	And the developer has responded.
10965420	10970700	Basically what happened was if someone bought, like, one of the most expensive cars early
10970700	10973660	on, they give you a free other car.
10973660	10977740	If not, they give you that car for free, but in order to get in on this, you had to buy
10977740	10981340	the game at launch and join their, like, Forza rewards program or whatever.
10981340	10982380	I don't know what that is.
10982380	10982700	Wow.
10983820	10987420	So it's a mess, and I really don't like this whole-
10987420	10991340	you bought a $60 game, now we'll throw free-to-play type elements into it.
10992060	10994780	It's something I hope doesn't last too long.
10994780	10995980	I really hope so.
10995980	10997820	I hope people reject that.
10997820	10999180	Anyway, you said you had one more thing?
10999900	11005100	The last point I wanted to make, on the subject of Loki being too harsh towards the new consoles,
11005100	11006300	no, I don't agree.
11006300	11008300	I don't think he was overly harsh at all.
11008300	11011740	The fact of the matter is, the games aren't there yet.
11011740	11016060	I mean, I bought the next one because I want to be one of the first, you know,
11016700	11021580	developers who didn't get into the early program to put games on the system.
11021580	11024700	You know, I didn't buy it because I had to have it.
11024700	11029260	The game I've most been looking forward to playing is Peggle 2, and that comes out tomorrow.
11030700	11031200	Good choice.
11032060	11035420	I got Forza 5, I got Dead Rising 3, they've mostly been sitting there.
11036220	11040300	So it's like, you know, the Skype thing is cool.
11040300	11043020	The TV features are neat, but I don't use most of them.
11043020	11049660	I just, you know, it's cool to be able to say, okay, watch CNN or watch Comedy Central
11049660	11053740	or whatever, and the Xbox One will push the buttons on your cable box for you.
11054460	11057180	And again, this call coming from an Xbox One.
11058300	11062620	It's cute, you know, it's nice, but it's not a have-to-have kind of thing.
11062620	11066380	There's no real reason, in my opinion, to own one of these boxes right now.
11066380	11066780	Wow.
11066780	11068940	And there's no real reason to own a PS4.
11069820	11070620	Not yet.
11070620	11072060	The games aren't there yet.
11072060	11072540	Not yet.
11073100	11073580	All right.
11073580	11075500	YYR, this has been a fantastic call.
11075500	11075980	I love this.
11075980	11078060	I got to let you go so we can get some more calls.
11078060	11079340	But thank you for demoing.
11079340	11081580	One quick thing, actually, yeah, really quick.
11082140	11088460	The last thing from PastoLR, Jamie said, Jamie pointed out that our society, our government,
11088460	11091180	and our healthcare systems don't give enough attention to mental health.
11091740	11094140	Probably the truest statement that ever was.
11094140	11096380	This needs to be dealt with.
11096380	11097580	It needs to be looked into.
11097580	11099420	It needs to be focused on.
11099420	11100860	It's really important.
11100860	11101820	I agree with that.
11101820	11102380	Absolutely.
11102940	11103180	All right.
11103180	11107500	YYR, thank you so much for binge listening to OLR and then calling us from your Xbox
11107500	11107660	One.
11107660	11108780	I appreciate it.
11108780	11109900	And he was very well prepared.
11109900	11111180	Too much is never enough.
11111180	11111500	All right.
11111500	11112140	Take care, buddy.
11112940	11113500	You too.
11113500	11113820	Bye.
11114460	11115740	Always a pleasure to hear from him.
11115740	11118780	And that was a lot of fun to go to the Xbox One for the calls.
11118780	11119260	But whoa.
11120220	11121020	What the fuck was that?
11121020	11122220	Are we dialed into AOL?
11122220	11123020	Did somebody here-
11123020	11124220	Are we connected to a BBS?
11124220	11125020	Did somebody just-
11125020	11125980	Did we just call a fax machine?
11125980	11128060	Was that a fax machine that was calling us?
11128060	11130460	By the way, Rob, you know what's actually super funny?
11131420	11133980	Is that Tiara just beat Mass Effect 2.
11133980	11134220	Yeah.
11134220	11135580	And she romanced Garrus.
11135580	11136300	1877-
11136300	11138300	Definitely sister after my own heart.
11138300	11140700	1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.
11140700	11142060	Orange Lounge Radio.
11142060	11142700	All one word.
11142700	11144220	But the phone is still ringing off the hook.
11144220	11145180	Let's go to it.
11145180	11146220	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11146220	11146620	Who's this?
11148060	11148460	Second.
11148460	11150060	Trying to fix my- can you hear me?
11150060	11150780	Yes, we can hear you.
11150780	11151020	Hi.
11151580	11152780	I had to fix my iPhone.
11152780	11155900	Anyway, I just wanted to call real quickly about Danny Wells.
11155900	11156140	Yeah.
11156140	11157100	This guy's Judo, right?
11157660	11157900	Yeah.
11157900	11158380	Guy Judo.
11158380	11158700	Hey, buddy.
11158700	11159180	How you doing?
11160060	11160380	All right.
11161260	11161420	Yeah.
11161420	11164540	What I just wanted to mention was I didn't know him as Mario.
11164540	11167180	I knew him as the bartender on the Jeffersons.
11167180	11169340	That's where he's mostly known for me.
11169340	11170300	Oh, my God.
11170300	11171020	That's right.
11171020	11172140	He was, wasn't he?
11172780	11172940	Yeah.
11172940	11174860	He was Charlie on the Jeffersons for years.
11174860	11178620	So that's really where his notoriety comes from, you know?
11178620	11181340	So many talented people on that show are deceased.
11181340	11184220	You know, I mean, is anybody from that show?
11184220	11186620	I mean, I know we lost Sherman Helmsley.
11186620	11188700	We lost Roxy Roker a long time ago.
11188780	11191260	I mean, there's so many people from that show that aren't around anymore.
11191260	11193660	I think Bentley might still be alive.
11193660	11195500	I think Florence is still alive, too.
11195500	11196140	Oh, yeah.
11196140	11198860	Florence is alive, but I think family's alive, too.
11199740	11200220	Not sure.
11200860	11202300	But yeah, that's where I knew him from.
11202300	11204620	And I was looking him up on IMDB.
11204620	11205500	I didn't even know that.
11205500	11207260	This is another video game related thing.
11207260	11210620	He did some voice acting for one of the Splinter Cell games.
11211420	11213420	So he's been connected with video games.
11213420	11214380	That's really cool.
11215020	11218380	Well, I like that you're recognizing him for things that
11218620	11219340	aren't just Luigi.
11219340	11222220	I mean, obviously, our community remembers him for that an awful lot.
11222220	11223500	But that's great.
11223500	11225900	That's some awesome little, like, trivia type stuff.
11225900	11226400	That's cool.
11227020	11227180	Yeah.
11227180	11229580	If you grew up in the 80s, I mean, you know that guy's face.
11229580	11232620	I mean, he's been like an extra on so many television shows.
11232620	11236140	He's always playing, like, some kind of slimy, carn-artist type of guy.
11236780	11238380	He just has one of those faces.
11238380	11241020	Well, plus, you know, I mentioned earlier in the show,
11241020	11243020	I binged on game shows a lot when I was a kid.
11243020	11245100	And what came on after game show binges?
11245100	11246460	The Jeffersons.
11246940	11247420	Moving on.
11248220	11249180	Freaking love that show.
11249180	11250380	Yeah, that show is great.
11250380	11252460	A spin-off of All in the Family.
11252460	11254380	Never realized that till years later.
11254380	11256860	Yeah, we could talk about TV for hours.
11256860	11259740	But yeah, All in the Family, we had so many freaking spin-offs.
11261340	11265420	You can even count Good Times as a spin-off from All in the Family.
11265420	11265900	That's true.
11265900	11271580	Because the mother came from Maud, which was a spin-off of the All in the Family.
11271900	11278540	All right, we need to write all this down for Dark Sakura's future I'm a Nerd in 30 show.
11280940	11283980	You're gonna have an episode all about connections to All in the Family.
11285980	11287180	And one last thing.
11287980	11292460	When you guys mentioned the game show that let you run around and, like, pick video games.
11293660	11297260	I thought, at first, I thought you met this other game show that I love called,
11297260	11299580	it was like, it was a take-off of the new League of Legends game.
11299580	11300860	It was called I'm Telling.
11300860	11302300	We had, like, a brother and sister.
11302300	11303020	I remember that show.
11303020	11304060	That show is great.
11304060	11306300	Yes, that was great.
11306300	11309420	And they had a similar thing where they will let you run through a maze and, like,
11309420	11314140	you hit, like, this little siren thing to try to match with your brother or sister pick.
11314140	11315500	Then you would get all the prizes.
11315500	11316380	That was just cool.
11316380	11317580	I so remember that.
11317580	11320860	And, like, because I was virtually, I mean, I do have a brother and a sister,
11320860	11323580	but they're 14 and 16 years older than me.
11323580	11326060	So I was kind of like an only child growing up.
11326060	11329340	And I always was like, I want somebody to go on this show with.
11329340	11331260	But, you know, it was never going to happen.
11331260	11333420	Yeah, they should have done a Friends edition.
11333420	11334860	That would have been, that would have worked.
11334860	11335340	Yeah.
11335340	11335980	Oh, yeah.
11335980	11336940	That's all I got for you.
11336940	11338780	Kaijuto, thanks for the walk down memory lane.
11338780	11339260	Appreciate it.
11339260	11340220	Have a good one.
11340220	11340460	All right.
11340460	11340860	You too.
11340860	11341180	All right.
11341180	11341900	Bye.
11341900	11343980	Great tribute to Danny Wells.
11343980	11345580	What about the other things Danny Wells did?
11345580	11346460	Those are great.
11346460	11347100	I love that.
11347100	11350140	You know Dark Soccer, 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype,
11350140	11352140	Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
11352140	11355900	You know, Dark Soccer, if you were to do a show like that,
11355900	11357740	like the nerd stuff and I'm 30 or whatever,
11357740	11359180	I could see in the theme song for you.
11360220	11362860	Those were the days.
11363500	11364220	Answer the phone.
11367820	11368780	We don't like my singing.
11368780	11370380	1877 Game OLR.
11370380	11371020	Oh, hi.
11371020	11371420	Hi.
11371420	11372620	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
11372620	11373420	Who's this?
11373420	11375980	This is the one and only Ron McCalling from Brooklyn.
11375980	11376860	Hi, Rama.
11376860	11378060	And you're on webcam too.
11378060	11379820	Are you calling us from your Xbox One?
11380620	11383420	Yeah, I'm calling from pre-Xbox One.
11383420	11386620	It's called having Skype next to your Xbox 360
11386620	11388700	and chatting that way because it's a lot more fun
11388700	11390940	and you can shit talk that way without having Microsoft
11390940	11392140	kind of breathing down your throat.
11392140	11394380	So you're calling us from an Xbox Vision camera?
11395100	11395740	Actually, no.
11395740	11397580	I'm calling from my awesome Logitech camera.
11397580	11398080	Awesome.
11398940	11401500	Well, I noticed you got your Luigi hat on
11401500	11403100	and you got your Luigi coffee cup.
11403100	11404300	You have a Luigi coffee cup?
11404300	11405260	That's awesome.
11405260	11406300	Got it from Nintendo World.
11406300	11409580	They also have a Happy Holidays Christmas mug as well.
11409580	11412140	You're in your Luigi shirt.
11412380	11413740	I see a Luigi shirt that says...
11413740	11414300	What does that say?
11414300	11415660	It's mirror imaged for me.
11415660	11416380	It says the L...
11417020	11419020	The L does not stand for loser.
11420060	11423740	So you are in full black Luigi mode tonight.
11423740	11425180	Yeah, something like that.
11425180	11428140	A friend of mine does a webcomic called Sucks to be Weegee
11428140	11429340	and it's pretty funny.
11429340	11431260	And somewhere around here I have a...
11431260	11432700	Oh, here it is.
11432700	11435820	I also picked this up from my soon to be tree.
11438060	11441100	A Luigi ornament that says Happy Holidays.
11441660	11442780	That's adorable.
11443740	11445580	Now, I got some stuff we gotta talk about.
11445580	11447420	So Rob, get the coffee on.
11447420	11448380	We got some talking to do.
11448380	11449260	All right.
11449260	11450540	I'll get out the cheesecake.
11451340	11452220	Oh, fabulous.
11452220	11452720	Fabulous.
11453740	11455660	Tell me about that one time in St. Olaf.
11460220	11461740	Rob, you are something else.
11461740	11462380	I know.
11462380	11463260	I get that a lot.
11463260	11463660	No, really.
11463660	11464160	What's up?
11465020	11468780	To back what Kaijido said, that's what I knew Danny Wells from
11468780	11473500	because when the show first came on, I spotted Luigi before I noticed Mario was
11473500	11475260	done by Captain Lou Albano, okay?
11477020	11481420	So that whole thing kind of comes full circle to me.
11481420	11481920	Yeah.
11482220	11482720	Oh.
11483340	11486540	Also, I like to say, fuck yes to Square One TV.
11486540	11490140	That show got me to run home to watch it, okay?
11490140	11490640	Me too.
11491500	11496940	Got out of school at 3.10, I was there watching Thundercat to 3.30, Square One TV at 4.
11497900	11500860	I think Square One was on for us at like three.
11500860	11503980	Like I had to get home fast if I wanted to see it because, you know, elementary school,
11503980	11504940	you get out a little earlier.
11504940	11506860	PBS affiliates don't have a set schedule.
11506860	11508540	It differs from every single market.
11508540	11511660	Yeah, I think for us it was on at three, but I think it was timed for like when elementary
11511660	11513100	kids get out of school, so it makes sense.
11513740	11516380	Yeah, and if I missed it on one PBS station, I could catch it.
11516380	11519100	On another PBS station, like an hour or a half hour later.
11519100	11520220	You have more than one?
11520220	11521740	He's New York City, dude.
11521740	11526780	Yeah, we have PBS 13, there's Channel 21, there's 25.
11527500	11529980	There's like 50 PBSes.
11529980	11530940	Never heard of this before.
11530940	11533180	There's a network that we get to Channel 50.
11533180	11534140	Well, we get a few of them.
11534780	11536940	We've got Channel 6, take it or leave it.
11539100	11542860	And the minute you have your antenna, you can pick up stations from Connecticut.
11542860	11545500	Oh, that's right, because there's a PBS 9 in Reading.
11545500	11546700	Anyway, cool story, bro.
11548300	11551340	Let's talk about TV channels in your neck of the woods.
11551340	11553740	No, no, let's not, let's not.
11554700	11559980	And what I just realized, with Nintendo rehashing all of these video games,
11559980	11565660	Nintendo is becoming that old celebrity is trying to relive their prime with another greatest hits.
11566220	11567740	That's what it's like this time.
11567740	11570700	You know, it's like you first have Donkey Kong Country in,
11570700	11573900	Donkey Kong Country Returns, Donkey Kong Country comes back again.
11573900	11577420	I think the next one's going to be Donkey Kong Country comes out of retirement.
11577420	11582460	The only difference is maybe extra level or redone music or something like that.
11582540	11584300	Donkey Kong is getting up there in age.
11585180	11588220	Yeah, how about Donkey Kong gets out of retirement home?
11589100	11592780	Are you looking forward to the new Donkey Kong Country game or are you over it?
11593500	11594300	I'm over it.
11594300	11597260	Like I said, I'm only picking up a Wii U once, Bayonetta 2,
11597260	11598620	and Mario Kart 8 comes out.
11598620	11600460	Other than that, it can wait.
11600460	11601900	Mario Kart 8 is what, April?
11602780	11603420	Yeah.
11603420	11606460	I don't think they really have a date yet for it, but I think it was around April.
11606460	11607980	Yeah, April or Mayesh.
11607980	11610060	I am living for Mario Kart 8.
11610060	11611420	It better deliver.
11612220	11615260	Yeah, even if it gets delayed, I'm like, I can wait.
11615820	11621340	Yeah, if it's a great Mario Kart game, it'll be worth the wait.
11621340	11621580	Yes.
11623180	11625260	A couple of things.
11625260	11629900	I think last week, a week prior, I talked about podcasting and the Sound Blaster card and stuff.
11631500	11635020	Any desktop PC off the shelf can do the same thing.
11635020	11637420	You have to go into the settings and enable it.
11637420	11638220	You can do it.
11638220	11640140	Oh, for some reason,
11640140	11641900	my studio computer doesn't do it so well.
11641900	11644300	And I just want to point out, just for our listeners,
11644300	11646780	Rama's call quality is dropping significantly,
11646780	11648700	so that's why his voice kind of changed a little bit.
11648700	11649740	I don't know what's going on.
11649740	11652140	He might need to stop his porn torrents or...
11652140	11652620	No, I just...
11653260	11658380	Sometimes, with all the 50 PBSs transmitting signals in New York City,
11658380	11660860	sometimes the signal gets a little clogged.
11660860	11663100	I'm not sure if you're following porn by PBS.
11663100	11663580	Never mind.
11664780	11665580	Well, I think you're right.
11665580	11668860	It is my porn torrents.
11668860	11672300	Finally, finally, somebody fesses that fuck up on this show.
11672300	11674460	Yes, Robin, it was my porn torrents.
11674460	11675180	Thank you.
11675180	11676380	You're an honest man.
11677100	11679340	I abuse my files connection.
11679340	11682860	I get 66 megs coming down, 33 megs going up.
11682860	11686380	All right, Rama, a quick last thought to get out here before we let you go.
11687420	11687740	Yes.
11688460	11690300	Okay, my last thought is this.
11691340	11694540	If you want to play classic Nintendo cartridges on your Wii U,
11694540	11699500	turn your Wii U on, push start A, and a spot will pop up for classic cartridges.
11700460	11704060	Okay, go post that to 4chan and see if somebody believes you.
11704060	11709420	All right, Rama, it's getting very crackly and stuff, so I really have to let you go.
11709420	11712140	But thanks so much for the call, and have a good one, okay?
11713500	11714060	All right, bye.
11714700	11718700	Rama, anime jam session on Tuesday nights, everybody, here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
11719340	11721020	We can probably squeeze in one more call.
11722220	11723980	There's a little ad on my Skype right now.
11723980	11728380	I just want to point out, talk to friends while watching live TV with Skype on Xbox One.
11728380	11728880	No.
11731420	11734060	There's no box for me to respond, so.
11734060	11739260	All right, 1877 Game O-L-R or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11739260	11741900	I do want to see if I can at least get to some of these Twitter topics,
11741900	11743740	because we had some good Twitter topics come in,
11743740	11746220	and we're falling a little behind here on the show.
11746780	11748220	Loki, did you have any last minute stories?
11748780	11749740	Uh, no.
11749740	11750460	No, okay.
11751100	11753180	Um, let's see.
11754060	11760220	Surtur wanted to ask, he hopes that Bobby and us talk about Grand Tourism.
11760220	11762300	Grand Tourismo 6 tonight.
11762300	11766940	You know what, Dan, we got it, and Dan's been playing the crap out of it.
11766940	11769180	He really liked it, and then he actually watched football,
11769180	11770940	which made me wonder who replaced my husband.
11773020	11774460	Dan doesn't usually watch football?
11774460	11776380	He does sometimes, but usually with other people.
11776380	11777820	He was in there watching it by himself.
11777820	11779660	I'm like, where's my husband?
11780460	11780940	Who are you?
11781980	11783820	Uh, Spazinator tweets us and asks,
11783820	11786780	Loki, quadruple cheese and quadruple bacon pizza,
11786780	11788700	or quadruple bacon double cheeseburger?
11788700	11789420	I can answer that.
11789420	11789920	Pizza.
11790780	11793660	No, because that much cheese on the pizza is actually not very good,
11793660	11796540	and even extra cheese on the pizza is not very good.
11796540	11798860	And when you do quadruple cheese, trust me, I've seen it before.
11798860	11801980	It's just, it's not as good as you'd think, because it's too much.
11801980	11803740	That's a lot of grease you're adding on there,
11803740	11806540	and it just, it throws off the magic ratio.
11806540	11808620	Adding tons of bacon though, go right ahead.
11808620	11810460	You're taking that question way too seriously.
11810460	11810940	I know.
11810940	11811500	All right.
11811500	11814060	How do you think he didn't take it far enough, to be honest?
11814060	11817180	1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11817180	11818300	I wonder if that was on our end,
11818300	11820460	because we were getting more calls a minute ago,
11820460	11823020	and now nothing is lighting up, sad face.
11823020	11824620	Okay, let's see.
11826140	11827580	ActDeft tweeted us,
11828540	11832460	there's more info surrounding the legend of Sonic 3's soundtrack.
11832460	11834860	I wonder if this ties into the whole Michael Jackson thing,
11834860	11837580	because wasn't there a, wasn't there like a,
11838220	11839820	somebody ran a whole thing on that.
11839820	11840700	He didn't like,
11840700	11842780	Jackson didn't like the limitations of the sound chip,
11842780	11843740	didn't like the way the,
11844460	11846220	he didn't like the results of the soundtrack,
11846220	11848620	so they still kept some of the inspiration,
11848620	11852140	but ultimately he wasn't credited and specifically involved.
11852140	11852780	Okay, apparently though,
11852780	11854780	this actually doesn't have to do with the game trailers thing.
11854780	11857100	Apparently, and this is the story that ActDeft leaked us,
11857100	11860060	just to kind of try to cover this quickly,
11862060	11865900	Fever, it's Fervor, Fervor Records on YouTube,
11865900	11870700	posted some unreleased music tracks from the band the Jetsons,
11870700	11873100	not the Jetsons, but the Jetsons.
11873100	11873580	Clever.
11873580	11879900	And one track called Hard Times was somewhat like the theme of Ice Cap Zone.
11879900	11881740	Well, why does that fucking matter?
11881740	11884460	Because the keyboardist of the group, who is Brad Buxer,
11885340	11888060	worked on the title along with Michael Jackson,
11888060	11889660	which he said in an interview.
11889660	11892540	He's not sure what material the developers used in the game,
11892540	11895740	but I guess it was remnants of that unreleased song,
11896620	11898700	so you know what?
11898700	11900380	Michael Jackson had something to do with it.
11900380	11902780	And because Michael Jackson is such a perfectionist,
11903420	11906060	I would fully believe that he just didn't like the way it was turning out.
11906060	11907580	So he walked away from it easily.
11907580	11908140	Easily.
11908140	11911180	I think that's the simple, simple story we have there.
11912860	11915100	Let me get to the calls real quick here.
11915100	11916140	We got one more call coming in.
11916140	11917100	This will probably be up for tonight.
11917100	11918060	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11918060	11918560	Who's this?
11919980	11921580	Hey, Zaku, we haven't heard from you in a while.
11921580	11922080	What's up, buddy?
11922940	11923980	Oh, not that much.
11923980	11928380	Just trying to chill on my night off.
11928380	11931100	Well, somebody turned out the lights,
11931100	11933260	but we're getting a lot of video calls tonight.
11933260	11933980	I like this.
11933980	11935180	So what's up, buddy?
11936220	11938140	No, I'm just trying to clean up Steam right now.
11938140	11941100	Managed to get like a second hard drive.
11941820	11943660	Well, actually two of them set up in raid,
11943660	11948620	but the idea is I'm gonna start moving my Steam games towards that one
11949420	11951660	and then actually downloading whatever else I don't have,
11951660	11953500	whatever else is in my backlog right now.
11954620	11957580	You look like you woke up at six in the morning to call this program.
11959180	11961020	I'm just like getting ready to go to bed.
11961580	11962140	It's all good.
11962140	11962620	It's all good.
11962620	11964860	Just don't mind the sore throat and congestion.
11964860	11966700	So what are you playing on Steam then?
11966700	11968140	What's your big Steam games of choice
11968140	11970220	that you got to move everything around to make space and stuff?
11971100	11974380	Well, I'm just trying to get stuff like the orange box,
11974380	11976620	all the other, you know, the other Half-Life games.
11976620	11981660	I just like, I guess I lost track and never actually got around to downloading it.
11982380	11985020	And then, you know, stuff like the two, you know,
11985020	11989500	the first two Mass Effect that I have and Sleeping Dogs.
11991100	11994700	I don't know if I want to do GTA 4 because I'm still on five, obviously.
11995340	11999100	And I still have Arkham Asylum and Arkham City that I still have to like fire up.
12001260	12004780	Everybody's got a backlog the size of 50 PBS stations
12005420	12007900	that they have to work their way through this holiday season.
12007900	12010860	Thank gosh, there's no more games coming out right now.
12010860	12013500	But what, what, what can, what can the listeners of our show
12013500	12015260	or what can we help you with tonight, Zaku?
12016460	12020700	Um, I, I guess, have you noticed, like, um,
12020700	12025820	I don't know if you covered this already, but remember that fighting game Skullgirls?
12026380	12026860	Yes.
12026860	12028140	Yeah, I get to play that tonight.
12029180	12031820	Um, apparently in two weeks,
12031820	12035900	their publisher Konami is pulling their games from the PSN and Xbox Live.
12035900	12036780	I caught you.
12036780	12040700	You did wake up just to call this show because we did talk about that about an hour ago.
12040860	12044140	So yes, we touched on some of the basics of that, but what, what are your thoughts with that?
12045580	12045980	I don't know.
12045980	12048700	I mean, this is this, this typical behavior of them.
12049580	12053900	I mean, if it's not, if it's them, like, you know, screwing over
12055020	12059020	itg or basically not giving shit about the money series,
12059580	12061900	it's them screwing over independent developers.
12061900	12066140	Well, hold on though, because I mean, and granted, I'm not going to be,
12066140	12069820	I'm not going to claim to be up and up on Skullgirls and everything that's going on,
12069820	12072780	but my understanding from what I'm reading is that they had an agreement.
12072780	12074860	The agreement is ending as of such and such date.
12074860	12076700	So Konami says, well, if we're not going to be making
12076700	12079100	money from this anymore than Yank, it's getting pulled.
12079660	12081820	But they didn't even, they didn't even, uh,
12082780	12086620	it didn't even inform their, their actual, uh, their developers.
12087500	12090780	They did not like, they did it behind their back.
12090780	12095340	Obviously they probably knew, they probably knew about the, the end of the agreement,
12095340	12099340	but they didn't even give them a heads up so they can plan a transition.
12100380	12101500	That's bad.
12101500	12103500	That's like bad business practice.
12103500	12109020	Like it's very unprofessional of them, especially if you're in a contract with a particular,
12109020	12113580	with another company that you're working with and you don't have the wherewithal to, you know,
12114460	12118220	provide for a smooth transition for all the other customers, all the other customers using it.
12118780	12123500	Let me, let me ask you this because, you know, what, what would be the best way to kind of
12123500	12127340	give that message to Konami that you're not happy with what they did?
12127340	12130940	Because obviously the answer is not boycotting Skullgirls because, you know,
12130940	12133180	you want to support that game, so that's not the answer.
12133180	12137420	And I don't think boycotting all Konami products is really a realistic answer.
12139420	12141420	Yeah, there's not, there's not enough stuff coming out.
12141420	12145180	So if, if gamers are really pissed off about this, Zaku, like you are,
12145180	12148220	what do you think is the best way we can express that to Konami and make them listen?
12148220	12150140	Stop buying their iOS and Android games.
12150140	12151500	Cause that's where all their business is now.
12153100	12156620	They basically, I mean, Babani's gone mobile at this point.
12156620	12161500	I don't, other than like niche pockets in arcades and certain parts of the country,
12161500	12167340	if not the world, everything else is just them microtransactioning all their, their,
12167340	12170060	their IPs, their music, rhythm based IPs.
12171500	12172460	That's pretty much it.
12172460	12175260	Well, yeah, that's been the state of Mamani for a few years now,
12175260	12177420	which is sad and depressing, but other people-
12177420	12183580	The principle of a work, you know, an independent, you know, an indie dev trying to, you know,
12183580	12189020	find a publisher, give them the light of day, but then at the, you know, the other hand,
12189020	12192540	they're actually, you know, they're actually doing not being, you know,
12192540	12197500	not giving them the professionalism that they gave them during the whole process.
12198460	12202940	As I said, it's, it's what, it's really what happens when you try to work with another,
12203740	12207420	with other clients and those clients in particular,
12207420	12210860	don't want to give you everything necessary to achieve business goals.
12210860	12215580	Well, I'd be curious to see if Konami does end up having to respond to this at all,
12215580	12218380	but I don't know, I just kind of have this weird feeling that-
12218380	12219180	They probably-
12219180	12224620	They probably won't and gamers will support Skullgirls on PC later on and then that's,
12224620	12225340	that's that.
12225340	12225900	But Zaku-
12225900	12230060	I guess what they're trying to do right now is they're trying to find another publisher or
12230060	12233980	trying to, well, right now in the short term, they're trying to get another build in,
12233980	12238860	they're trying to get an update in just to keep the game alive, per se.
12239580	12244140	But in, in terms of, yeah, they're done with Konami at this point, but they just need to,
12245260	12249580	they just need to, you know, be more, they need to do a little bit more due diligence
12249580	12252140	on their actual, on their future publisher.
12252780	12255660	All right, Zaku, I've got to, I've got to wrap this up.
12255660	12258940	We've got to go because we're running way late, but you know what?
12258940	12264540	I, I'd be, I'd be curious to see what the response is on a greater scale to this because
12264540	12267020	obviously there's a lot of people that are pretty unhappy about this.
12267020	12268060	But, uh, I don't know.
12268060	12270540	I just, I just don't know if it's going to be enough to make waves, but we'll see.
12270540	12271100	We'll see.
12271100	12271340	All right.
12271340	12271740	All right.
12271740	12272620	Zaku, take care, buddy.
12272620	12273180	Thanks for the call.
12273180	12273740	Have a good one.
12273740	12274060	All right.
12274060	12274860	Sleep well.
12274860	12275260	Bye.
12275260	12276140	Vitamin C.
12276140	12277500	You look like you have a cold.
12277500	12277820	All right.
12277820	12279580	One, uh, no, no more phone numbers.
12279580	12279980	Sorry, guys.
12279980	12283100	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but, uh, we're running along tonight, so we've
12283100	12286860	got to wrap it on up, but please, uh, you can always email us your thoughts.
12286860	12290220	Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com.
12290220	12293980	I had one other Twitter topic I wanted to hit on and, and we didn't have last minute
12293980	12294620	stories, right?
12295420	12297020	S2 100 Matt tweeted us.
12297020	12303260	This is sports ball related, but someone took the Alabama versus Auburn unbelievable final
12303260	12306300	final play and remade it in Tecmo bowl.
12307260	12308140	So, okay.
12308140	12309180	I have to watch that.
12309180	12315260	And then somebody put this in a way that would make Jamie and I care is really the news I'm
12315260	12315660	hearing.
12315660	12317180	And then I have to show it to my mother.
12318060	12321420	My mom was reporting for Alabama bowl is great.
12321420	12322060	All right.
12322060	12323420	Uh, we got to wrap it up.
12323420	12328220	We are like, so done because, uh, this is almost a four hour show tonight and it's,
12328220	12331820	it's not even a marathon show, but thank you guys for staying with us tonight.
12331820	12333980	The whole way through really appreciate it.
12333980	12337580	You know, we always say here at orange launch radio, if you like the show, all we ask, tell
12337580	12342780	a friend or five or 15 or 50 about the show, help us spread the word about orange launch
12342780	12343020	radio.
12343020	12344060	We really appreciate it.
12344060	12347980	Uh, leave us a nice word or a nice review wherever you found this show.
12347980	12349820	Maybe that was iTunes podcast.
12349980	12353420	Stitcher radio, uh, has been doing great for us lately.
12353420	12355420	And we really want to thank the folks at Stitcher.
12355420	12359020	I don't know if you guys know this, but we broke the top 15 game shows this past week.
12359020	12363820	That, that blows my, blows my mind and that's really because of you guys out there listening
12363820	12364540	and supporting the show.
12364540	12365580	So I really appreciate it.
12365580	12367740	So, uh, leave a nice review and so forth.
12367740	12369660	Uh, every little bit helps.
12369660	12373340	And I think that's a big part of why we are doing as well as we are over there.
12373340	12378780	Um, before we close up shop tonight and play the credits, uh, I gotta get people's final
12378780	12379500	thoughts.
12379500	12381340	Jason, thank you once again for being here.
12381340	12382540	I hope you had a good time.
12382540	12385580	Always, always, always, always, always what people may not realize.
12385580	12391180	You have to drive an, an hour and 45 minutes to get here one way on a Sunday and you do
12391180	12395660	it for this show and then you go back and you, yeah, and you edit the video.
12395660	12399020	So you, you are, we, we really appreciate your dedication and thank you.
12399020	12399580	Thank you.
12399580	12403580	The show would not be possible without you literally because you've also helped us with
12403580	12404460	many a web thing.
12404460	12405020	So thank you.
12405020	12405420	Thank you.
12405420	12406540	I always look forward to it.
12406540	12408860	Uh, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
12411260	12415260	I am doing a very good job of having ideas, not writing them down and forgetting them.
12415260	12416300	So here's to here.
12416300	12417180	You forgetfulness.
12417180	12419020	You have a laptop in front of you.
12419020	12419820	I know.
12419820	12423900	Launch that notes application and have it open at all times, sir.
12423900	12425740	Yes, I am definitely doing that from here on out.
12425740	12426780	That's an order.
12426780	12427100	All right.
12427100	12428460	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.
12429260	12434940	Um, I also forgot that I played surgeon simulator 2013 today.
12434940	12437020	Or I should say, I let my son watch me do that.
12437020	12441900	It was more like knocking stuff off desks, a simulator, because that's what I was doing
12442460	12445500	because he was too afraid of the actual surgeries.
12445500	12446780	It's like, I don't like this game.
12447740	12453580	Um, so yeah, so that's all I have.
12454460	12454940	All right.
12454940	12456620	And dark soccer, your final thought tonight?
12457260	12457760	Meh.
12458700	12459420	You know why?
12459420	12460060	Why?
12460060	12462300	Because I went pink berry and it's not cheat day.
12462300	12462800	Okay.
12464620	12465020	Okay.
12465020	12467500	That's I'm going to leave it at that, uh, beak.
12468220	12473500	Yeah, because I may or may not have something in the freezer right now, but I'll save it.
12473500	12474220	I'll save it.
12474220	12475020	I'll save it.
12475020	12475740	All right.
12475740	12482460	Uh, my final thought for the night is, um, candy canes are the best thing about Christmas.
12483260	12487420	Candy canes are the best thing about Christmas and that new candy cane flavor at the pink
12487420	12487920	berry.
12488940	12493260	Actually, they do have peppermint, but dark soccer brought me a pumpkin candy cane before
12493260	12493580	the show.
12493580	12494700	It's like a giant one.
12494700	12496540	I ate it all during the show.
12497580	12498780	Cause I love food.
12498780	12500140	You were done before the show.
12500140	12501420	Actually, that was during Bobby.
12501420	12502300	I love food.
12502300	12504300	Did it really taste like pumpkin pie?
12504300	12505020	It was good.
12505020	12505180	Yeah.
12505180	12506780	It tastes like, I offered to let you lick it.
12507340	12508380	I don't want your cooties.
12508380	12510300	You already gave me gay seven years ago.
12511100	12511980	Remember that?
12511980	12512940	Sorry about that.
12512940	12514860	No, no, there's a story.
12514860	12515180	All right.
12515180	12515580	Quickly.
12515580	12516860	Cause we got plenty of credits.
12516860	12521420	We were at Goff land and they had these big Pepsi bong bone drink things.
12521420	12524940	And so I let Rob have a sip of it and I said, I don't have cooties or anything.
12524940	12525500	He's like, okay.
12525500	12526460	And took a drink, passed it back.
12526460	12527660	He goes, I have gay.
12527660	12530940	I was like, and Irene was there and I was like, Oh my God, Irene, let's date.
12534060	12538940	And for the rest of the day, you did kind of, she just shrugged.
12538940	12539440	Maybe.
12539980	12540380	All right.
12540380	12541980	Uh, I know Irene's pretty cute.
12541980	12547100	Uh, thank you guys again for downloading the show and checking it out.
12547100	12548140	We really appreciate it.
