1
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:11,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Guy, and Loki!

2
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:33,126
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

3
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi How are you, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

4
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:03,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay You're okay?

5
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:24,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Been better I think you and I are kind of in the same boat right now We are recovering from the plague Yes, we both have been a bit plague-ish this past weekend Although I don't think it's the same plague, or maybe it is, I don't know But I don't think I gave you cooties I don't think you gave me cooties I wasn't very, very sick But I've just been tired and worn down, so

6
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:26,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got it from Becky.

7
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:27,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Or from Dan getting it at work.

8
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been sitting here rolling my eyes for a solid month.

9
00:02:03,564 --> 00:02:09,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Because seriously, this isn't cold and it's not humid, so you don't get cold with wet wind.

10
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:11,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's a funny piece of that puzzle.

11
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:18,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's not here tonight in studio, although he's been joining us on and off for the past month, not here tonight is Jason, our announcer.

12
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:22,213
[SPEAKER_02]: He has the night off, and would you like to guess why he has the night off?

13
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:23,114
[SPEAKER_02]: He has the plague.

14
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:23,834
[SPEAKER_02]: He has the plague!

15
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:32,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm fairly certain that the whole reason why I haven't been as sick as everybody else has been is because I practically live at the gym now.

16
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:47,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you not supposed to work out when you're sick, though?

17
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was like a big no-no.

18
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:59,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I was reading lately that for people who spend regular, like at least two or three days at the gym a week, tend to have a stronger immune system.

19
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:00,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.

20
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:07,039
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anything, that would explain why I've only been sick for like a day.

21
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:12,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but like Extrovert from Horde House is a big old gym guy now and he still gets sick a lot.

22
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:16,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not a lot, but like as sick as often as I do.

23
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:22,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I haven't gotten sick nearly as often as I used to before this became a regular thing, so...

24
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:23,807
[SPEAKER_02]: TechMasterLoki

25
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:39,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

26
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:40,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

27
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:41,313
[SPEAKER_02]: What day did you have your wisdom teeth out?

28
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:42,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday.

29
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:42,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday.

30
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:43,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're here.

31
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:44,755
[SPEAKER_02]: This is only like three days later.

32
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,757
[SPEAKER_02]: See, it's so different for different people.

33
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:48,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some people are better like the next day.

34
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:50,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Like go right back to work.

35
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are out for like two weeks.

36
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:53,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

37
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:54,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks.

38
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:55,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

39
00:03:56,685 --> 00:04:00,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't you one of the ones that was out for like a frickin' two months or something insane?

40
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Four months.

41
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:03,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, what happened?

42
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,170
[SPEAKER_05]: The holes never filled in on the bottom teeth.

43
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So I basically had swelling and bruising for at least two of those months.

44
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:14,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the pain didn't... I was on antibiotics for... I was on five different antibiotics.

45
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:15,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that pre-OLR though?

46
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:17,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't remember that affecting the show.

47
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:17,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugh.

48
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:19,918
[SPEAKER_02]: The show's been on too long.

49
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, sorry.

50
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:22,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's... Around 2004.

51
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, then I guess we would have had the show.

52
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:25,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Loki's moment.

53
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:25,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

54
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:30,166
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I saw the swelling, um, and I can't really chew food.

55
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:32,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I can sort of chew food.

56
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:37,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I've been slowly getting into more solid stuff, you know, because before it was smoothies and soup.

57
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,153
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

58
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:45,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So, today, I tried to do french fries from McDonald's and it sort of works.

59
00:04:46,158 --> 00:04:46,739
[SPEAKER_07]: It sort of works.

60
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,399
[SPEAKER_07]: You're making it work.

61
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:48,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then, um,

63
00:04:51,260 --> 00:05:00,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I'm not, like pain medication, I'm not really taking any unless, you know, sometimes during the night just because it makes the swelling, the feeling of the swelling go down.

64
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:04,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Like right now, like today, I don't feel as swollen, but it feels like it's all swollen on the inside.

65
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Like sometimes like if I sleep on my side or something, I feel like I bite my cheek or something.

66
00:05:09,553 --> 00:05:09,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

67
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:11,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of get that feeling right now.

68
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:12,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

69
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:13,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I already had one of the stitches come out, so.

70
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:14,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

71
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:17,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, you know, sitting there talking, I was like, pfft.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,580
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this?

73
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,741
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a string here.

74
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:22,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew!

75
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:24,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not get too detailed.

76
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:26,863
[SPEAKER_02]: We want people to keep listening before we get to the video game talk.

77
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:30,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm glad to see you're doing much better.

78
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:33,586
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you're one of those people that made a quick recovery, so good for you.

79
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:38,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently I metabolize the anesthesia medicine really fast too.

80
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, what happened to the Loki goes to the dentist or whatever video that was going to be planned?

81
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't really out of it.

82
00:05:47,157 --> 00:06:00,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I was a little tired and stuff at first because they gave me Valium to take before I went there, which is good because I have all sorts of unnecessary phobias about all sorts of...

83
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Surgical, probably because I haven't really done any of that stuff.

84
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:09,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had any experience with having surgery or being put under.

85
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really go to the doctor that often, so I get a little nervous around needles and stuff.

86
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't like it.

87
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:21,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there's no real danger to it, but it still makes me uneasy.

88
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,332
[SPEAKER_07]: The Valium helped.

89
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:26,015
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't let me stay awake and listen to them.

90
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:27,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

91
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:46,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, work.

92
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:48,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad that shit knocks me the hell out.

93
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:55,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I woke up and they're all trying to help me out, help me sit down.

94
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, I'm not dizzy.

95
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I can walk just fine.

96
00:06:58,841 --> 00:06:59,662
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a problem.

97
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:01,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we went out to the car.

98
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:06,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I'm not really, I'm tired, but I'm not really dizzy or anything.

99
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:06,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Bummer.

100
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:08,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, unfortunately I wasn't loopy.

101
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Nellie said I said weird things, but all of those were intentional weird things.

102
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:12,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, you always say weird things.

103
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:16,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I was making bad jokes, and she's like, well, you said this joke.

104
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:22,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, but I remember saying that, and I meant that on purpose, so that's not just me saying weird things.

105
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:47,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let me go to the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com and if you are listening live on this Sunday night, come on down to the chat room live.vognetwork.com We often read comments from chat on the show because it is the show where every gamer has a voice YYR starting us off tonight saying, come for the video game talk stay for the gross medical drama Yes

106
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,351
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an episode of VR.

107
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,331
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't that bad.

108
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:53,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if I start talking about my hernia surgery that I had a few years ago.

109
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we not?

110
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:55,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not.

111
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:55,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we not?

112
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:56,455
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not fun.

113
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:56,975
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

114
00:07:57,015 --> 00:07:57,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

115
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:58,156
[SPEAKER_07]: That was way worse than this.

116
00:07:59,357 --> 00:08:00,117
[SPEAKER_07]: I was awake through that.

117
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:03,239
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt saying, don't have rice.

118
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say popcorn either way.

119
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:07,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.

120
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:08,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not chewing anything.

121
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:10,223
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty much all liquid stuff right now.

122
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:11,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate a lot of pudding.

123
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff that I can... Eggs, you know, like I had eggs last night and those are dull.

124
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:21,982
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like the best eggs ever because, you know, after having just smoothies and, you know, tomato bisque soup.

125
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:22,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like pudding?

126
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:23,584
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

127
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:26,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say because you can mix protein powder and pudding.

128
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:31,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my wife wanted me to have like... She got... Well, she meant to get rice pudding but it ended up being tapioca.

129
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:32,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no.

130
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome Unicorn is in our chatroom saying, man, when I had all four wisdom teeth out, I agreed to fill in for dinner theater the same night.

131
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:50,706
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hardcore, because having to sing, I would assume dinner theater means you sing, and just all that vibration would, oh, that's not fun.

132
00:08:51,987 --> 00:08:57,531
[SPEAKER_02]: That must have been some non-impacted easy peasy teeth coming out there, because that's too much.

133
00:08:57,878 --> 00:09:02,260
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I was just thinking back to... I wanted to stay awake so I could watch.

134
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted them to put a mirror so I could watch.

135
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,161
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thanks.

136
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:06,041
[SPEAKER_05]: But they wouldn't let me.

137
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they wouldn't let me watch my hand surgery either because it was too small.

138
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:17,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But they had to give me laughing gas to make my veins dilate so that they could get the IV in.

139
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:21,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And that hand stayed bruised for like a week and a half.

140
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:22,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw that.

141
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:40,426
[SPEAKER_02]: some more comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Zebediah the Messiah saying long time listener on iTunes first live show well welcome, welcome to the show yeah we've been getting some new listeners lately just thanks to, well I know he said he's a long time listener but just thanks to Stitcher, he's doing very well

142
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:41,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't recognize that name either.

143
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,187
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Awesome Unicorn as well, who I don't recognize.

144
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that a little redundant?

145
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:46,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, aren't all unicorns awesome?

146
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,129
[SPEAKER_07]: All unicorns are pretty awesome.

147
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:55,052
[SPEAKER_05]: The girl at Starbucks, when I told her that I wanted a unicorn when she asked if I wanted anything else, she drew a unicorn farting rainbows on my cup.

148
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,054
[SPEAKER_05]: On the little sticker that goes on my reusable cup.

149
00:09:58,074 --> 00:09:58,754
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

150
00:09:58,794 --> 00:09:59,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept it.

151
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:00,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

152
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:00,755
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.

153
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:05,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And then DarkTetsuya in chat says, I was wondering if there was going to be a show or not.

154
00:10:05,657 --> 00:10:08,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing everyone's sick and then Loki having his wisdom teeth out.

155
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:14,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we had to be here because otherwise Zebediah the Messiah would not have had a live show to listen to.

156
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:18,764
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I didn't know how it... I mean, I didn't know how... Everyone was saying, oh, you're going to be out for a while.

157
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:19,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't know.

158
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully nothing... I mean, so far, I think everything's healing just fine.

159
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows, like a week from now, you know, oh, sorry, that just...

160
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Infection, lol So they give you Keflex?

161
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:50,117
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Amoxicillin, and then I have the, because I can't swallow pills, yet somehow, thank goodness that that volume was really small, because I couldn't drink water with it, because normally I just, I down a little water and salt and stuff.

162
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:52,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Druggie lounge radio, everybody.

163
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:54,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, this is legal if you've been prescribed it.

164
00:10:54,119 --> 00:11:00,884
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, I have whatever, it's like Tylenol with codeine or whatever, whatever that is.

165
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:02,879
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave me Vicodin.

166
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when those stopped working, they gave me horse pill Vicodin.

167
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:11,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the one that's pure, pure hydrocodone and no other crap.

168
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:15,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I just... When I had my gallbladder out, I slept for like a week straight.

169
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,490
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what I did.

170
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,091
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I did?

171
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:21,313
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I left the house after gallbladder surgery, do you know what I went to do?

172
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:26,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my gallbladder surgery like two days before Halloween because it was my ex's birthday.

173
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:26,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Hilarious.

174
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:31,802
[SPEAKER_02]: But the first time I left the house after that was to go vote against Prop 8.

175
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:34,444
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first time I left the house after my gallbladder surgery.

176
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:36,165
[SPEAKER_02]: What a worthy cause.

177
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:37,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very worthy cause.

178
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:39,708
[SPEAKER_05]: And you didn't vote absentee.

179
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:41,773
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I never vote absentee.

180
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:47,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of those people where I'm like, I think absentee, for me, I realize tons of people vote absentee and that's cool, at least you're voting.

181
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,636
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, absentee takes the magic out of it.

182
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:54,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I like to go in the little booth, click the, I don't know, there's just something about that whole process.

183
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:55,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like people.

184
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:56,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is fine.

185
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:01,280
[SPEAKER_05]: So I vote, I take my absentee, well, the voting place is actually, I could walk there in five minutes.

186
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

187
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So I fill out my absentee ballot at home with the internet in front of me and then I go take it and drop it off.

188
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:08,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

189
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:08,589
[SPEAKER_02]: That works.

190
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:13,035
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've gone to the place, but I voted in a very comfortable manner.

191
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:13,615
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

192
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:14,076
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

193
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:20,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, before we get into argument weeks and the things we've been playing this week, some other topics here at the top of the show.

194
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:25,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a whole lot in regards to kickoff topics, but we are entering the holiday period.

195
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we here at OLR, as far as I know, we're going to be doing shows every Sunday.

196
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:35,753
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not taking any time off for the holidays because everybody kind of lucks out this year with Christmas and New Year's being on, what, Wednesdays?

197
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Christmas and New Year's are both on Wednesday this year.

198
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:41,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday happens to be the 29th, so whatever.

199
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:42,814
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be here those days.

200
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,075
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us are traveling anywhere major.

201
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:52,277
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be here through the holidays, but since we're starting to ramp up toward that season, I don't know about you guys, but

202
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:57,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have a lot of time off where I'm doing nothing for like a week and a half at least.

203
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:02,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys going to be catching up on any games or do you have any gaming plans through the holidays?

204
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:06,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a wish list of things you got to get through in the next month?

205
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:12,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I still have to beat Skullgirls with everybody, which I just started it last night and beat it with Parasol.

206
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not last night, but the other day.

207
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:19,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do want to get at least up to a 35 and finish that stupid quest that I'm stuck on.

208
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's in 14.

209
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:21,037
[SPEAKER_02]: 14, yeah.

210
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah, okay.

211
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:29,285
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm still trying to do the play a new game every week thing, so like this past one with Skullgirls, I'm going to start Deadpool next week.

212
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:30,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

213
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:31,688
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

214
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my goal is just to do something different.

215
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:35,275
[SPEAKER_02]: One new game a week.

216
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:35,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

217
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:38,181
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they'll be going to Washington later.

218
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:40,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good luck.

219
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:41,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

220
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:42,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Snowpocalypse.

221
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:45,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Get lots of pictures of the snow on the way up there.

222
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say thank you very much, Loki, before the show.

223
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:51,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you don't mind me saying this on air, but Loki gave some Christmas presents out before the show.

224
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:55,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a Steam gift card from Loki, and I believe DarkSakura got one as well.

225
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:56,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

226
00:13:56,245 --> 00:14:00,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm armed and ready for the winter sale.

227
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,209
[SPEAKER_02]: When does that start, Loki?

228
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:02,410
[SPEAKER_02]: The winter sale for Steam?

229
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought the winter sale was already done.

230
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:05,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it the fall sale?

231
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:06,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't keep track of these sales.

232
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:09,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's going to be a Christmas New Year's sale.

233
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:10,715
[SPEAKER_02]: There always is, right?

234
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:11,376
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

235
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,736
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't call it Christmas.

236
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,477
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it holiday sale, right?

237
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:18,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we just saw was the winter sale, and now there will be the Christmas sale.

238
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in chat set us straight.

239
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,162
[SPEAKER_05]: The winter festival sale.

240
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the fall sale that they had.

241
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

242
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's fall-spring.

243
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:24,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

244
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:26,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fall-spring because the thing was upside down.

245
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:27,545
[SPEAKER_02]: It said spring.

246
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:27,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the winter sale is coming right up.

248
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

249
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

250
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,960
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just saying yay.

251
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yay.

252
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:35,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, sales.

253
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:37,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what about your projects?

254
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,625
[SPEAKER_02]: You love to start projects that you never finish.

255
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:40,725
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that tablet going?

256
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:46,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, because I was actually thinking about that the other day because I got some more stuff for that.

257
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally, I was going to use...

258
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:59,601
[SPEAKER_07]: It's similar to how they did the crossplane thing where they had individual circuit boards for each controller and it would have hooked up almost like a cartridge that you'd plug in.

259
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:06,006
[SPEAKER_07]: So I bought a Sonic 2 and Sonic & Knuckles Genesis thing.

260
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:07,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to rip the whole thing apart and use the...

261
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:11,349
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, connectors on there for that.

262
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:14,970
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's too damn small for what I want to do.

263
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to need to add stuff to it later on.

264
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:19,011
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, okay, that's not the way to go.

265
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:26,753
[SPEAKER_07]: So the way to go is actually buying this... It's like a USB thumbstick that you plug into your system.

266
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what they call it now.

267
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:31,215
[SPEAKER_07]: But it basically allows you to...

268
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:43,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Use almost any controller on any system, including keyboard and mouse, on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PC, and it just works.

269
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do that.

270
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:55,149
[SPEAKER_07]: That simplifies wiring everything a lot more than it was before, because now I don't have to worry about having to switch between multiple different systems.

271
00:15:55,789 --> 00:16:01,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just wire up one controller to it, and then just run it through that, and it would work on multiple systems.

272
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:03,795
[SPEAKER_07]: instead of having to do all that stuff.

273
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:07,358
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, I'm still consciously working on all that stuff.

274
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:12,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have to get the parts and figure out the feasibility and stuff to get it working.

275
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:23,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Mainly right now is I'm trying to figure out how to make the actual case for all of it because that's going to be difficult since I've never done vacuum forming before and I have to design the case and...

276
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:34,702
[SPEAKER_07]: But before that, I was kind of distracted by, okay, how am I going to get this so that I can wire up different controllers, configurations and stuff to one system?

277
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:40,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now I don't do that anymore, so that makes it a lot easier in the design process.

278
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:43,159
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm still going to make it, eventually.

279
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your plan while you... Because I know you probably have a little time off of work.

280
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:47,402
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your plan during that?

281
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:48,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any time off of work.

282
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:49,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

283
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:53,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, you know, like... The days, but... The days, oh, yeah.

284
00:16:54,547 --> 00:17:07,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I will have time off of work a few weeks after that, but... Well, that's for the baby, so... Well, actually, right now, I've been kind of in the, you know, what do I want to play and stuff, and...

285
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:09,397
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

286
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:46,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, DeepSilverInvolition, for wasting 40 fucking hours of my time playing that game and basically making my save completely useless.

287
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:52,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's apparently a widespread problem where not only is it not a save thing...

288
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like people that bought the DLC, their game's just not fucking working anymore.

289
00:17:57,924 --> 00:17:59,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so frustrating.

290
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:01,708
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, thanks a lot.

291
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:05,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, you know what, I just want to play something stupid today.

292
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to play some Saints Row.

293
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:10,775
[SPEAKER_02]: After losing 40 hours in a game, how would you have the motivation to play again?

294
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:14,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to cheat like a motherfucker is how I would do it.

295
00:18:14,578 --> 00:18:15,719
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's the thing, though.

296
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:22,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to grind through, even cheating like crazy to make it super easy so I can just get through all of it fast.

297
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to do that.

298
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:31,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Why should I even put myself through the effort to play this game when it's so obviously broken that...

299
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I can't, I can't do it.

300
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:43,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just, it's not gonna be worth it for these DLC missions, which, let me be honest, they're probably about 30 minutes long each, if I'm lucky.

301
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:46,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I just don't know if I want to do it.

302
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:51,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would like to go back and do it, but I wish my save would work just fine, because...

303
00:18:52,546 --> 00:19:07,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it was fun and it's definitely not mods because I've uninstalled, I deleted the whole game off my computer, redownloaded everything, no mods are in there it still fucking doesn't work so it's just something with their game and it's disappointing

304
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:36,561
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, I don't know I try to figure something else to play for me, I kind of want to do the Jamie thing and try to do some new games although with Final Fantasy XIV getting a patch this week I'm obviously going to dump a lot of my time into that but I'm trying not to spend my entire vacation because my work actually shuts down between Christmas and New Year's we have to take the time off so I have lots of time off to do very little because my family doesn't do an awful lot of holidays you can hang out with me

305
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,784
[SPEAKER_02]: We can absolutely hang out and do stuff.

306
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to Ikea every day.

307
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:41,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day.

308
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:48,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, things should hopefully slow down a couple days after Christmas, which is the period that I've got all this time and nothing to do.

309
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:54,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I might finally crack and get the PlayStation 4 because the finances are looking pretty good now, so this might be the time.

310
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:55,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally do that.

311
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:59,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, and I understand if you're still hesitant about picking up the PlayStation 4 because there aren't a lot of games out there.

312
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:03,889
[SPEAKER_07]: There is one game that's on current gen systems that would take up a good portion of your time.

313
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me guess.

314
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it start with grand and end with a five?

315
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it does.

316
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:11,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I was looking to see if it was on sale at Target when I was on Amazon.

317
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:12,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Thirty nine.

318
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:13,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

319
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I might jump on that.

320
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:15,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I really might jump on that.

321
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:16,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

322
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:18,559
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

323
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying, just saying.

324
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:48,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not knocking the system, but it's just like, you know, there's not a lot I would play on it.

325
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:54,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Even like the PlayStation 4, like either of the systems, there's not a lot I would really... We have no reason to look at either right now.

326
00:20:54,683 --> 00:21:04,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't need a PlayStation 4 right now, but, you know, knowing that after seeing the Final Fantasy XIV footage with the remote play, I'm like, oh, God, I want... At least you know a date now.

327
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:05,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

328
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:19,979
[SPEAKER_05]: and by the way, we just picked up Star Fox 3DS last night because we had coupons and Dan's all over that one so we've got plenty to play right now and Dan has a villager in Normandy you can go run by his tent now that Normandy is open

329
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:48,020
[SPEAKER_02]: the other big games I have to beat are Mario 3D World and Zelda Link Between Two Worlds because I do love both those games a lot probably my best of the year for sure but I keep getting distracted with all these other games I'm trying to play too so I definitely want to play those games and beat them probably inevitably during the winter sale Bioshock Infinite will be on sale and I can finally play and beat that and I'm hoping I can get I think it's still on sale now it's been like dirt cheap like 10 bucks I bought mine ages ago for dirt cheap

330
00:21:48,180 --> 00:22:00,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping I can get The Last of Us and Beyond Two Souls from the rental company over the holidays as well that would be fantastic or Zelda Wind Waker is on my list too because I gotta catch up with that

331
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,861
[SPEAKER_05]: We've actually got Ocarina for 3DS on our list.

332
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:03,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and I do.

333
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:04,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

334
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:05,743
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

335
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:08,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Go into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

336
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:12,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome Unicorn says, Resogun make the PS4 purchase worth it for me.

337
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:14,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of the games I'm really eyeing.

338
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:15,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to get that.

339
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth Dream said, PlayStation 4 is worth it for Doki Doki Universe right now.

340
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:20,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know a lot about that game.

341
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:21,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of it.

342
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:29,756
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR says, a friend who works at GameStop said today that PS4s were sold out in 10 minutes, but Xbox Ones were in stock all day and didn't sell.

343
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,157
[SPEAKER_02]: He had no idea why.

344
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:35,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm hoping that if I do want to get a PlayStation 4, I can actually get one.

345
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:37,859
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be really great.

346
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

347
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragenator says, Sky, technically no one actually needs any games or system.

348
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,683
[SPEAKER_02]: People need food, water, shelter, oxygen, etc.

349
00:22:46,763 --> 00:22:48,684
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, do you want the system?

350
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:50,425
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, starting us off.

351
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:11,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now.

352
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:12,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.

353
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you lying to the listeners?

354
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:14,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't lie to the listeners.

355
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:14,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Normandy's open.

356
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:15,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody come hang out.

357
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds.

358
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hubby made a house in Normandy, right?

359
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:21,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucker.

360
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I love him.

361
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:51,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that asshole I'm also playing Zelda I uh

362
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:57,111
[SPEAKER_05]: What else did I play?

363
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:10,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I played Skullgirls, which I really like, and finally got to, for some reason it doesn't work very well with the Capcom fighting controller, but it works just fine with the regular Xbox 360 controller, so that's what I'm using.

364
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:15,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I loaded the Shiva, and then I stopped playing it.

365
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:20,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I've probably done five more playthroughs of the Stanley Parable, and I got the Portal ending.

366
00:24:22,443 --> 00:24:24,165
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

367
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:42,856
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

368
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:00,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to play more Bus to Move Universe.

369
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:02,793
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is not very good.

370
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:10,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to like it so much because playing it on my phone is freaking awesome, but playing it on the 3DS is not awesome.

371
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:11,300
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not awesome.

372
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:19,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, oh yeah, I've been playing a lot of Bejeweled on my phone because that's my I really need to get sleepy game.

373
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:23,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the music in that game.

374
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:24,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't help it.

375
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:28,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It does kind of have like new agey Philip Glass type of soundtrack to it.

376
00:25:28,714 --> 00:25:29,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I love Philip Glass.

377
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:34,777
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, but the one on the phone, it's like this epic type music.

378
00:25:35,337 --> 00:25:46,943
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of almost like whenever you see ancient Mesopotamia, that type of music, you know, like you're watching Ben-Hur or something.

379
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

380
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:50,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic movie trailer of epicness.

381
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:50,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic.

382
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,258
[SPEAKER_05]: It's epic.

383
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I played more of Fractal.

384
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:00,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have Fractal?

385
00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:01,625
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

386
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:03,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm getting you Fractal.

387
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:03,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

388
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:04,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to live with it.

389
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:05,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

390
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:06,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Fractal is a great game.

391
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Free games rule.

392
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:12,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm ruining one of your presents.

393
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:14,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have Fractal yet?

394
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:15,176
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to play Fractal.

395
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:22,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Fractal is like the best puzzle game in the universe.

396
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:23,683
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me super happy.

397
00:26:24,323 --> 00:26:26,184
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, for anyone who just showed up, Normandy's open.

398
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's probably about it because I didn't play any Final Fantasy this week.

399
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:32,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I played last week, which is how I got harassed for my name.

400
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:39,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody go on the VOG website and read my article.

401
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:41,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there you go.

402
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:43,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

403
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:45,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Grand Theft Auto Online.

404
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:52,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I ended up in a lobby with, I guess, a modder or hacker or whatever you want to call him.

405
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:57,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever the case may be, I ended up level 40 and I have $13 million now, so that ain't bad.

406
00:26:59,273 --> 00:27:07,178
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I messed around with the content creator a little bit and tried to make a race and it turned out okay.

407
00:27:07,658 --> 00:27:09,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you can stack objects.

408
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:21,287
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like a trick where you can stack objects and make them float in the air, which is kind of what I wanted it to do in the first place, but they made it so damn difficult to do that, so I just kind of didn't mess with that part too much.

409
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:22,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

410
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the way it integrates in your game and stuff.

411
00:27:44,884 --> 00:27:47,966
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the waypoints on there, but they're orange instead of blue.

412
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:54,850
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can go on Social Club and basically bookmark any stuff that you like on there.

413
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:59,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will show up in your game and you can play it and do all sorts of fun stuff.

414
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:04,957
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now they have just the race and deathmatch creator, but I guess more stuff is coming out later on.

415
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:07,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, what else did they play this week?

416
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:08,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

417
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other strange stuff, or a little unusual, I guess, for me.

418
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:19,830
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we were bored, and I was trying to occupy Josh, so I tried to get him to play Wii Sports.

419
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:25,537
[SPEAKER_07]: That didn't work, because he didn't want to play it, and he wanted to watch me play it, so I showed him bullying.

420
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So I played a little Wii Sports this week.

421
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um...

422
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:32,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Also played a little bit of Rabbids Go Home.

423
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:38,367
[SPEAKER_07]: He thought that game was a little bit funnier because the rabbits are being stupid and gathering trash.

424
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,447
[SPEAKER_07]: He still didn't understand.

425
00:28:39,747 --> 00:28:41,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Those games are kind of made for kids, too.

426
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:42,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

427
00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:48,151
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't understand why the rabbit was screaming at people and their clothes were falling off and they were collecting clothes.

428
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:53,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was worrying that their shopping cart was going to tip over because it was stacked really tall with all sorts of weird things.

429
00:28:55,093 --> 00:28:55,833
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of funny.

430
00:28:55,874 --> 00:28:57,094
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, you've got to be careful.

431
00:28:58,074 --> 00:28:58,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't turn so fast.

432
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,238
[SPEAKER_07]: and then what else did I play?

433
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:21,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I played a little bit of Just Cause Multiplayer just getting in the last little bit of their beta that should be launching actually tomorrow so I'm looking for that I'll be coming out on Steam worthwhile investment if I say so myself and then what else did I play?

434
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:26,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh... A little Call of Duty, I guess, at work.

435
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:28,978
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing really else to play there.

436
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:32,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um... That's pretty much it for right now.

437
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:38,306
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh... Hopefully... Hopefully we'll get into some Saints Row.

438
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:40,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I want to go back.

439
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,329
[SPEAKER_07]: It... It...

440
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad.

441
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,471
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just frustrated.

442
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:47,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Rabble, rabble, rabble.

443
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:49,451
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, it's sad.

444
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:58,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Games like Saints Row 2 and stuff, I really liked going back into those and playing them again and stuff, but it's just the last couple of games they put out.

445
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:02,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Even Saints Row 3rd, I think I played through that at least two or three times.

446
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:04,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to do it again.

447
00:30:04,194 --> 00:30:07,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to go through all the hassle because it's like, I've already seen that joke.

448
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:09,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny.

449
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:11,556
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I don't know.

450
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:22,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, maybe if a certain other host that was on this network, you know, that would pick up a copy, then it might be worth it since I have to start from the beginning.

451
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:26,572
[SPEAKER_07]: We could go through together and play through a co-op campaign.

452
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I can also get those extra achievements I don't have yet.

453
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:30,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Travis Donovan, hope you're listening.

454
00:30:33,829 --> 00:31:01,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Bobby Okay, my gaming week I actually played a lot of random shit this week I powered on my 360 I've never heard of a lot of random shit, Rob It's a new game, it's by Random Shit Co So I powered on my 360 this week Which is like the first time in like four months Like I turned it on and it had to do a Like I seriously think the last time I played my 360 was When the Mass Effect DLC came out Sure it wasn't Forza Horizon

455
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack shit.

456
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

457
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your friends list expand on 360 now, too?

458
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:37,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Xbox supports a thousand friends?

459
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:42,056
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because all I see... I don't see what you're playing on Xbox One.

460
00:31:42,096 --> 00:31:43,757
[SPEAKER_07]: All I see is that you're on Xbox One.

461
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:45,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see what they're doing.

462
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:49,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is kind of weird, because you could do that on PC.

463
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember I used to see what people were playing on PC, but...

464
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:55,444
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they integrated there, so no, I don't have more than 100 people.

465
00:31:56,144 --> 00:31:56,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird.

466
00:31:57,025 --> 00:32:01,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have 99 friends right now, so find my username if you want to be the 100th person.

467
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:05,069
[SPEAKER_03]: You have 99 friends, but so-and-so ain't one?

468
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, somebody dropped me this week.

469
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who, because it won't tell me.

470
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:30,863
[SPEAKER_02]: and BlackWolf confirms no it doesn't well that sucks I was hoping for that expansion but oh well I admittedly haven't played a lot of 360 I'm not being a hater it's just nothing new I've really bought on 360 lately but I went back and visited some of my classics because I have a shit ton of downloads especially from like Xbox Live Arcade when Xbox first came out I know there's all that free stuff still although yeah I've been checking some of that out

471
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:31,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And they love you.

472
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:53,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Blessings be upon you for the mucus coming from your nose

473
00:33:17,102 --> 00:33:17,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

474
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:19,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those, like, you're going to sneeze, you're going to sneeze.

475
00:33:19,543 --> 00:33:19,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

476
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:22,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.

477
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:23,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Radio host's worst enemy.

478
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:24,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

479
00:33:24,386 --> 00:33:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's live.

480
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:25,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing I can do about it.

481
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:26,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

482
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:29,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine being in customer service and having that happen when you're trying to... Oh, I'm sure.

483
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:31,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in customer service for seven years.

484
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:31,789
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

485
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:36,672
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're trying to explain one's mortgage interest to them while they're yelling at you.

486
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:39,273
[SPEAKER_07]: You see where this spot is right here.

487
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:39,773
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where...

488
00:33:41,074 --> 00:33:42,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's see.

489
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:50,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was playing Spelunky on now PlayStation Network, which literally it is the exact same game as it is on PC, so there's not a lot I can report on.

490
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:52,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play it on Vita.

491
00:33:52,486 --> 00:33:57,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks great, although it's so tiny and it's hard to read things, but it worked well enough, so I'm cool with that.

492
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:02,237
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played one other game, and this game...

493
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:32,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm gonna get shit for my opinion because I didn't really get it and I have a lot of friends that are really really into this game but I'm gonna be completely honest I loved the presentation of this game I loved the way things looked and I was really cracking up but when it came down to the game itself I just really didn't have a lot of fun with the wonderful 101 on Wii U and I know I'm gonna get crap for that but it is what it is

494
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:33,651
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

495
00:34:49,452 --> 00:35:14,001
[SPEAKER_02]: so like the gist of it is that you control like an entire group of people and you pick up more people as you're running along and those people can be in different patterns like they can be in a circle to turn your main guy into having a giant like punching glove type of thing or it can be a straight line for a sword and then at some point when your group gets big enough you can kind of have both going on at once and then you also draw lines to get from place to place but a

496
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:16,182
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

497
00:35:44,196 --> 00:36:12,390
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess the game is supposed to be very challenging which you know I can respect it for that but it was a lot of um just kind of slash slash like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game with this interesting mechanic so mash and slash and hope you get it right yeah kinda that's what I felt when I was playing the game and so I feel kind of bad for razzing it because again it had a great setup and everything was in this really cool like package and the presentation was awesome and it looked great um

498
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,552
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the game itself, I just didn't really have fun with it.

499
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:17,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

500
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:22,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like this is one of those games that if I revisit it in a month or two, maybe I'll enjoy it again.

501
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:24,256
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't really care for it.

502
00:36:25,076 --> 00:36:26,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you are entitled to your opinion.

503
00:36:26,357 --> 00:36:26,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

504
00:36:26,837 --> 00:36:27,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

505
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:29,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I'm going to get emails telling me I'm wrong.

506
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:29,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

507
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it looked like Pikmin.

508
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:31,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know.

509
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:35,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

510
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:39,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful Pikmin.

511
00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:39,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

512
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:41,528
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

513
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:43,909
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

514
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:44,930
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

515
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really it for my gaming week.

516
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:51,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might try to get into that game like one more time.

517
00:36:52,053 --> 00:36:54,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, that was the game I played when I was sick.

518
00:36:54,354 --> 00:36:59,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could have been like kind of, but I'll try it one more time after I feel better.

519
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:03,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I still don't care for it, I'm probably going to send that one on back and get something else.

520
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:05,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that's really it for my gaming week.

521
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:06,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody else?

522
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:11,475
[SPEAKER_02]: pizza pizza pizza you bringing me pizza?

523
00:37:12,376 --> 00:37:14,019
[SPEAKER_04]: no alright

524
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:17,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, some quick housekeeping.

525
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:22,079
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, you better bring out your DS so that I can get the last piece of the puzzle I need for the Rhythm Heaven puzzle.

526
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Your thing hasn't street passed with me yet?

527
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:23,740
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

528
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Should have.

529
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh, weird.

530
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:24,980
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

531
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:35,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so don't forget to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and Google+, google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

532
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:38,463
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as shows off over the next few weeks, we don't have any planned.

533
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,623
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be here Sundays.

534
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:40,804
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

535
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:03,680
[SPEAKER_02]: You get an entry into the raffle, but you do have to opt into the raffle.

536
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,880
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not just entered by default.

537
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:10,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So you actually need to go to vognetwork.com, click on raffles, and actually enter the raffle.

538
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:16,408
[SPEAKER_02]: This month we are giving away a $20 gift card to an online source of your choice.

539
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning, I think the options are...

540
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:25,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox, PlayStation, Steam, Wii U, and regular Wii because those are still separate.

541
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:30,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I know iTunes is in there too for people who don't even have any gaming consoles whatsoever.

542
00:38:30,497 --> 00:38:31,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Play probably.

543
00:38:31,998 --> 00:38:34,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Google Play was one of the options, but it probably should be.

544
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure if you came in and said, I really don't want any of those.

545
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Google Play.

546
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure we can make that happen for you.

547
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:45,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is over at vognetwork.com slash raffle.

548
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:46,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

549
00:38:49,289 --> 00:39:13,874
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you you can either check in live and you get five points just for listening to the show or there's a if you're listening on the podcast feed there's a passphrase hidden somewhere in the show and you've probably heard it before Jason interrupts the show at some point and says to register participation for this week's episode and then he gives you a little passphrase you go to vognetwork.com you type that in the front page and you will get your points but make sure you opt into the raffle if you want to win your $20 card that's not Google Play

550
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:16,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

551
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:17,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Bobby in chat?

552
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, can they have Google Play?

553
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:22,118
[SPEAKER_02]: If they really want that more than anything, can they have Google Play?

554
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:24,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll need to hear back from Bobby.

555
00:39:25,581 --> 00:39:27,242
[SPEAKER_02]: VOG Master Bobby in just a minute here.

556
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:30,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Other thing I want to promote.

557
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:36,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It's award season for things that you like, movies and so forth, and podcasts are no different.

558
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:42,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, we didn't get nominated for the podcast awards, although I appreciate those of you guys that tried.

559
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:43,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I know many of you were trying.

560
00:39:43,692 --> 00:39:44,052
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't.

561
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:45,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, we didn't get nominated, sorry.

562
00:39:45,732 --> 00:39:47,153
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we did not get nominated for the Podcast Awards.

563
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:49,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of indie shows did, though, so I can't be mad.

564
00:39:50,274 --> 00:39:53,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a pretty good feeling I know which one of them is going to win.

565
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they do win it, they totally deserve it.

566
00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:59,556
[SPEAKER_02]: But I won't say it because I don't want to make a boobie of myself.

567
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:03,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, Podcast Awards, unfortunately, we're not there.

568
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:08,078
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have a chance to do the Stitcher Awards are going on right now.

569
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:11,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love Stitcher because Apple's podcast app right now,

570
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:13,932
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

571
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:46,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of the other VOG Network shows like Bobby's going for games and hobbies as well so a lot of our listeners are kind of voting for us one day and voting for him another day which is cool.

572
00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:53,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Under Station Live I think is making a push for Most Original which can't think of a better title for what they do over there.

573
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be awesome if they got that.

574
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:56,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out again.

575
00:40:56,962 --> 00:41:00,045
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of Stitcher Radio at Stitcher.com and we would appreciate

576
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:26,387
[SPEAKER_02]: your consideration during award season just you know it the exposure helps grow our family as I say at the end of every show we don't ask for your money we don't ask for anything just help spread the word about just your soul yeah just your eternal soul all right let's get into gaming news though that's what you really came here for you didn't come here to hear me promo all this stuff you want to hear about gaming news and us riffing on it so uh Loki oh wait wait

577
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:30,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a... Okay, BlackWolf has the determination.

578
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,951
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, do Google Play cards exist?

579
00:41:33,152 --> 00:41:33,492
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.

580
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:34,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they do.

581
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:34,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've seen them too.

582
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And BlackWolf says, then I guess they can has.

583
00:41:38,074 --> 00:41:39,835
[SPEAKER_02]: So you heard it here first.

584
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:41,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Add it into the raffle this month.

585
00:41:41,556 --> 00:41:42,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Play if you want.

586
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:43,538
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want.

587
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:45,839
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

588
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's get into gaming news.

589
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:49,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

590
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:57,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so this week everybody was up in arms because Content ID started going crazy.

591
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:58,945
[SPEAKER_07]: It became self-aware.

592
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:05,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, it started flagging a ton of videos, even more so than normal.

593
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:10,372
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is mainly because they opened it up from just, you know...

594
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:13,976
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

595
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:40,007
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, YouTube made a comment on it and basically said, nothing illustrates the incredible growth and evolution of YouTube better than the enterprise class.

596
00:42:40,047 --> 00:42:41,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this is all PR speak, by the way.

597
00:42:41,748 --> 00:42:42,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to interrupt that.

598
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:47,774
[SPEAKER_07]: As these networks grow, we are making products and blah, blah, blah.

599
00:42:47,794 --> 00:42:48,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

600
00:42:49,055 --> 00:42:54,520
[SPEAKER_07]: It is part of our commitment to ensure that all enterprise partners can continue to thrive and be successful on YouTube.

601
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's a whole bunch of bullshit.

602
00:42:56,401 --> 00:43:00,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, they said that, yes, those content ID things that went out were not a mistake.

603
00:43:00,865 --> 00:43:02,286
[SPEAKER_07]: They are real.

604
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:04,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So there.

605
00:43:05,222 --> 00:43:18,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of the problem is, you know, these videos, you know, for those not aware of the Content ID service, you know, I'm sure you'll probably hear from, you know, anybody that you follow on YouTube or, you know, a ton of people, you know, especially in the blogs recently.

606
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:26,616
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically this way of automating the process of finding, you know, videos out there that inflict or that...

607
00:43:28,097 --> 00:43:30,579
[SPEAKER_07]: have copyrighted material within them.

608
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:35,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the way it works is they have a 30-second sample or sample of their song.

609
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:40,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's like the first 30 seconds or video.

610
00:43:40,747 --> 00:43:41,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can be submitted to this service.

611
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:47,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And it basically checks the waveforms or whatever to see if they match this ID.

612
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:50,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Think of it like an MD5 tag or something like that.

613
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:52,997
[SPEAKER_07]: It checks to make sure that this is what this is.

614
00:43:53,657 --> 00:44:08,668
[SPEAKER_02]: some of our just to give some perspective some of our videos on the Orange Lounge Radio YouTube account have been flagged like old videos like things I don't really care about that were us playing DDR at E3 and like the song that's being played in DDR content matches

615
00:44:08,988 --> 00:44:27,277
[SPEAKER_02]: so even though we're filming off it because you know E3 is loud and has that background noise and even though we're filming off the TV it's still content matches which you know whatever like I really don't you know care I mean to be fair we were showing video of someone else's game not trying to really like monetize that or whatever but it's just kind of one of those eye roll things you know yeah

616
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:45,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, you know, the other thing, well, like I said, it's automated because before this content ID, you know, thing existed, it would be up to the content holders, you know, like Warner Brothers or whoever, you know, to actually go and find those videos and flag them manually.

617
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:49,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a very manual process and they bitched and moaned at saying, oh, look at all this stuff's getting, you know, copyrighted, there's...

618
00:44:50,516 --> 00:44:56,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Full episodes of shows and stuff on YouTube and this needs to be taken care of or else we're going to sue you.

619
00:44:56,097 --> 00:45:01,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's where they came up with this content ID thing and now everyone's getting flagged.

620
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:03,979
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is though it's automated.

621
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:07,699
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not necessarily done by these companies.

622
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:11,560
[SPEAKER_07]: So for example, say Capcom or something like that.

623
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, they probably have their materials in there because they don't want someone infringing upon that stuff.

624
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:20,284
[SPEAKER_07]: but they may be okay with you putting that stuff in there.

625
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:21,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Which Capcom is.

626
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:21,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which they are.

627
00:45:22,327 --> 00:45:36,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's still, you know, you have to go through the whole process of, you know, basically contesting it and then, you know, it gets sent to the Capcom or their legal team and they have to either say, you know,

628
00:45:37,924 --> 00:45:43,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we agree this is an error or no, this really is infringing and stuff.

629
00:45:43,688 --> 00:45:48,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can lead to copyright flags or copyright strikes.

630
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:50,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Three strikes and, of course, you're gone.

631
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:56,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Your videos are gone and you're not going to be using that YouTube account anymore to make money.

632
00:45:58,897 --> 00:46:01,219
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really annoying.

633
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:03,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, personally, I've had to deal with some of this stuff.

634
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:11,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a video that I made that was just some tutorial for Grand Theft Auto map editing and stuff.

635
00:46:11,364 --> 00:46:14,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have any music in the background, but there was no audio there.

636
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:19,189
[SPEAKER_07]: YouTube said, hey, here's some pre-approved tracks that you can use.

637
00:46:19,669 --> 00:46:21,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Using their own service, I picked one of those tracks.

638
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:22,571
[SPEAKER_07]: It got flagged.

639
00:46:23,351 --> 00:46:23,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

640
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:46,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

641
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:08,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a huge... This really irritates the piss out of me.

642
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:16,130
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on with that where other people are putting in their content ID and it's not even stuff that they really own.

643
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,133
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what needs to be come down hard on.

644
00:47:20,654 --> 00:47:25,399
[SPEAKER_02]: These companies that put in these content claims for things they don't really own.

645
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:48,146
[SPEAKER_02]: that that needs to stop and YouTube needs to come down hard and fast on that but they won't and that's that's gonna be this is gonna be a very interesting turning point because you've got a lot of very angry people about this because you know there's people that make their living off of YouTube videos and you know as much as you might want to say get a real job or things like that video editing is a bitch

646
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:59,794
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason I don't really like to put OLR on video, and I'm very thankful to our own VXJasonXV because he's the sucker that signed up and said, sure, I'll edit the videos to put it up on YouTube or whatever.

647
00:47:59,914 --> 00:48:04,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Jason, because ain't nobody got time for that as far as I'm concerned.

648
00:48:05,018 --> 00:48:06,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I got other things I want to do.

649
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,561
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a pain to edit videos.

650
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:11,743
[SPEAKER_02]: So these people that do edit video and do work on it, you know what?

651
00:48:11,803 --> 00:48:12,644
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to watch it,

652
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:19,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the author can make like a tenth of a cent or whatever they get from the ad that shows in the beginning.

653
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:29,349
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the people who have been making their money that way, like Classic Game Room, I think the Cine Massacre stuff, they've already left YouTube for other places.

654
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:33,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And SF Debris, I think, went to Vimeo or this other one.

655
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Vimeo allows gaming content.

656
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:36,511
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not for gaming.

657
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:40,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the guy who does the Star Trek and Doctor Who reviews.

658
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:42,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

659
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:47,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he went to Vimeo or he went to one other one, but he's been off of YouTube for a while now.

660
00:48:48,615 --> 00:48:55,000
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not good though because I mean, yeah, we're talking about the gaming portion of it, but I'm sure that not just gaming is affected by it.

661
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a ton of people are affected by it, you know, especially just all sorts of content producers and that's not good.

662
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:02,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not sending them a good message.

663
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:10,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically saying you're... And it's bad enough that once they do, you know, content ID you or whatever, they flag your video.

664
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:13,233
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not making revenue on that video anymore.

665
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:18,175
[SPEAKER_07]: The person who ever flagged it, they just assume that, whatever, they're making money off of it.

666
00:49:18,195 --> 00:49:19,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo does that.

667
00:49:19,495 --> 00:49:24,936
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so generous, and they allow you to keep your video up so that they can make money off of it.

668
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:26,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just ridiculous.

669
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:29,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I monetize the videos on my channel, Rob Roberts Plays.

670
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:35,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I sign up for the monetization and whatever, and I realize it's kind of shaky ground with copyright because I am playing...

671
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:39,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people's games, but they're old games.

672
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to think I'm kind of educating and bringing light to it, whatever.

673
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:46,082
[SPEAKER_07]: The amount of money, trust me, the amount of money is ridiculous.

674
00:49:46,102 --> 00:49:46,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

675
00:49:46,462 --> 00:49:47,042
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.

676
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:52,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I also don't have any disillusions that I'm going to make a shit ton of money off this and quit my job.

677
00:49:52,844 --> 00:49:55,325
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not going to happen, and I'm totally fine with that.

678
00:49:55,645 --> 00:50:02,887
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the kind of thing where I'm like, hey, if maybe one of the videos were to end up going viral and I can get money to afford a new microphone, then great.

679
00:50:03,847 --> 00:50:08,489
[SPEAKER_02]: We do spend money out of our own pockets to do this show and VOG and all that.

680
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,270
[SPEAKER_02]: If I told you how much I spend on my own money on this shit, you'd probably be surprised.

681
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

682
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:14,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to yield anybody.

683
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:15,271
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my hobby.

684
00:50:15,451 --> 00:50:17,311
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people spend money on their hobbies.

685
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:21,833
[SPEAKER_02]: If your hobby is remote control car racing, you probably drop a lot of money into that.

686
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:22,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Stan does.

687
00:50:22,613 --> 00:50:22,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

688
00:50:22,873 --> 00:50:24,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm saying.

689
00:50:24,693 --> 00:50:25,334
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my hobby.

690
00:50:25,374 --> 00:50:26,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I drop money into it.

691
00:50:26,094 --> 00:50:26,474
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

692
00:50:26,694 --> 00:50:27,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with pinball.

693
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:29,475
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can recoup a little bit of that, then great.

694
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:33,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I realized too with the Let's Plays, this is a slippery slope.

695
00:50:33,638 --> 00:50:39,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently did a Let's Remember video for The Legend of Zelda on NES, and you know that shit got flagged.

696
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:42,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just kind of one of those, I just rolled my eyes and like, whatever.

697
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, fine, I don't care.

698
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:47,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, 30 cents lost, what am I gonna do?

699
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:54,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one thing, Bobby just linked in chat about Jonathan Blow being flagged for posting his own game.

700
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:56,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, see that's really not good.

701
00:50:56,702 --> 00:51:00,743
[SPEAKER_02]: That shows a real problem with the content ID matching system though.

702
00:51:00,863 --> 00:51:03,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And GameGuru pointed out that it was SF Debris went to blip.

703
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:06,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it was one of those other ones.

704
00:51:06,545 --> 00:51:12,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Those comments from live.vognetwork.com SSJ100Matt saying there is going to be and should be a great exodus from YouTube.

705
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:15,967
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to start getting fed up with their flagging and content policies.

706
00:51:16,327 --> 00:51:19,228
[SPEAKER_02]: If many of the big time YouTube channels started leaving, people will follow.

707
00:51:19,568 --> 00:51:24,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be honest, YouTube is not a particularly difficult to steal technology.

708
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,652
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tons of other companies that do the whole video embedding thing.

709
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:32,836
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just kind of takes somebody stepping up and saying, yes, we welcome the gaming content.

710
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:36,859
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people assuming that Twitch would jump on that real quick.

711
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:42,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It would make sense because they already have ways that you can highlight and create a video on demand thing.

712
00:51:42,563 --> 00:51:45,985
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't have a way where you can upload your own videos that I know of.

713
00:51:46,085 --> 00:51:48,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can, and I just haven't really looked at that.

714
00:51:49,768 --> 00:52:03,497
[SPEAKER_02]: but needless to say the focus on Twitch TV certainly isn't video on demand but this is a huge opportunity for them if a competitor wanted to come in for Twitch TV this is a great way to get their foot in the door but I think the problem is and this is I don't

715
00:52:04,177 --> 00:52:04,838
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

716
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:38,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong, I understand if I take a track from some CD or something and blatantly put that up there in CD quality on YouTube, okay, that is infringing.

717
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:39,182
[SPEAKER_07]: That's ridiculous.

718
00:52:39,802 --> 00:52:42,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is weird because I see that shit all the time.

719
00:52:43,471 --> 00:52:43,891
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.

720
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:47,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go find a top 40 hit, bring up the YouTube and play it right now.

721
00:52:47,572 --> 00:52:50,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Although now I know we're putting our shows on YouTube, I better not.

722
00:52:51,554 --> 00:52:53,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see videos all the time.

723
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:55,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Or full-length movies.

724
00:52:55,275 --> 00:52:58,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched The Flight of the Navigator the other day on YouTube.

725
00:52:59,036 --> 00:52:59,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the fuck out.

726
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,516
[SPEAKER_07]: That video's on YouTube?

727
00:53:00,536 --> 00:53:01,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

728
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:02,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that movie.

729
00:53:02,117 --> 00:53:03,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That movie was awesome.

730
00:53:03,797 --> 00:53:05,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I watch documentaries all the time on YouTube.

731
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:07,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Freakin' Addictin'

732
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:51,342
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is the system is just not... I think a good compromise, and even still this isn't perfect, it would be... Let's say that a video comes out and... Let's just use an example of Nintendo.

733
00:53:51,863 --> 00:53:52,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo...

734
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,325
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't like the fact that you're using their video or something like that.

735
00:53:58,345 --> 00:53:59,587
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to monetize it or whatever.

736
00:53:59,847 --> 00:54:03,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that you should be able to split the revenue between what you've done and them.

737
00:54:04,193 --> 00:54:06,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a perfectly acceptable solution.

738
00:54:07,517 --> 00:54:11,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets a little complicated when you're talking music and stuff like that.

739
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:22,867
[SPEAKER_02]: The music one is a real tricky slope though, because to some extent I think the artists licensed their music for that game, they did not expect all this other stuff.

740
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:33,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is maybe how music needs to be licensed going forward, but I can kind of see a little bit more where these games with these very AAA soundtracks, it's a really slippery slope.

741
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:34,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of get that.

742
00:54:36,918 --> 00:55:04,521
[SPEAKER_07]: um the other thing I was gonna say is you know just because a lot of these companies or and I don't necessarily like that I don't blame those companies because a lot of them were like dude we don't know what's going on either I mean we just you know started to hear about this you know let us know if your video got flagged and you know or you know go ahead and you know object to it and we'll uh you know we'll go ahead and you know flag it and let it go through and stuff we we want you to have that stuff out there but um

743
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:16,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, there are lists out there of actual games that people will let you play and they want you to play at different publishers.

744
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,511
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the MMOs.

745
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:19,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Blizzard games.

746
00:55:19,792 --> 00:55:21,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a Wikia, for example.

747
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:25,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Wikia called letsplaylist.wikia.com

748
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:47,240
[SPEAKER_07]: and they even have a whole you know hashtag on Twitter who who lets play and those are all companies that will let you basically play their games and they're fine with you monetizing it usually and it will I think it will even let you know if if they you know allow that and stuff and

749
00:55:47,880 --> 00:56:05,210
[SPEAKER_07]: and I mean like you know like for example like Minecraft you can do that I want to say even I was surprised you know Rockstar they're fine with you doing Grand Theft Auto and you know that kind of stuff in there so there are companies out there and I think if that's going to be if they're going to really if these I

750
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:06,911
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

751
00:56:33,988 --> 00:56:37,789
[SPEAKER_02]: CodeMan in chat, speaking of live streaming and so forth.

752
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:42,350
[SPEAKER_02]: CodeMan over at live.vognetwork.com says, Twitch will eventually be in the same boat.

753
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:45,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's becoming more popular and copyright laws will hit it.

754
00:56:45,891 --> 00:56:53,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad that these things were made to share experiences with people and a few rotten apples screwed up for the bunch.

755
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:54,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he meant to say it's sad.

756
00:56:54,974 --> 00:56:55,174
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

757
00:56:56,614 --> 00:57:07,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting though, because now Twitch is in this really interesting boat where, well, but they're a part, they are literally integrated into PlayStation 4 now, and will be soon on Xbox One, or at least they certainly have that channel already.

758
00:57:08,026 --> 00:57:15,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo, not so much, but Nintendo kind of does their own thing with online, you know, they're not looking to get Twitch on there anytime soon.

759
00:57:16,154 --> 00:57:22,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but because now that Twitch is integrated into the consoles, it's going to make that kind of, it makes it a really weird thing.

760
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:26,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I can't see gaming companies suddenly coming after Twitch when Twitch is a part of the console.

761
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:31,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like if you put a game out on the PlayStation 4, you know that that's going to happen.

762
00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:38,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, from my understanding is, of course, game companies can turn it on and off, but who's going to be that dick company to turn it off?

763
00:57:41,368 --> 00:57:51,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody's in a rush to be the first to have that notorious distinction of you can't stream it on PlayStation 4 granted I guess Playroom's already in that boat but for other reasons completely

764
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:56,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else on the YouTube dramas you want to share, Loki?

765
00:57:57,431 --> 00:58:02,894
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just more interested to see how this is going to fall out, I guess.

766
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:04,415
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, see the reaction.

767
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:06,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it only happened late last week.

768
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:12,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if we've really heard a lot from publishers.

769
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:16,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, YouTube's kind of said their thing.

770
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:17,762
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

771
00:58:17,782 --> 00:58:19,042
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be interesting to see what...

772
00:58:20,203 --> 00:58:23,785
[SPEAKER_07]: What steps are going to be taken if people are planning on moving elsewhere?

773
00:58:24,426 --> 00:58:25,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what's going to happen?

774
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:35,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of PlayStation 4 streaming, BlackWolf says, I believe NBA 2K14 turns off the sound on the streams and captures, so it's all silent.

775
00:58:35,092 --> 00:58:38,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And that probably has to do with, you know, because a game like that's got a huge soundtrack behind it.

776
00:58:39,074 --> 00:58:40,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Those EA sports games always do.

777
00:58:40,655 --> 00:58:42,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So that wouldn't surprise me.

778
00:58:43,016 --> 00:58:45,418
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'd think that they would still be able to do game audio.

779
00:58:45,498 --> 00:58:47,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the game audio you think would be there.

780
00:58:48,599 --> 00:59:15,845
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah alright, anyhow going to another story really what they should do and this is the appropriate solution for NBA 2K14 is to really just substitute all the music in the game with Space Jam Space Jam the entire time that would be the perfect solution or I believe I can fly or I believe I can fly amazing

781
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:23,423
[SPEAKER_08]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SHELL.

782
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:24,343
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

783
00:59:26,064 --> 00:59:29,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to some games that won't be showing up on PlayStation 4.

784
00:59:29,305 --> 00:59:30,546
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably won't show up anywhere.

785
00:59:30,686 --> 00:59:35,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 38 Studios, the big studio that went bankrupt.

786
00:59:35,648 --> 00:59:43,931
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the baseball player guy owned, and then they made Kingdoms of Amalur, and then they shut down, and it left the state of Rhode Island with a big...

787
00:59:47,252 --> 00:59:52,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the auction happened this week to sell off some of their IPs and the trademarks and so forth.

788
00:59:52,695 --> 00:59:53,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And get this.

789
00:59:54,176 --> 01:00:00,079
[SPEAKER_02]: No buyer found for Project Copernicus, which was the MMO project they were working on.

790
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,542
[SPEAKER_02]: No buyer found for the sequel rights to Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning.

791
01:00:04,662 --> 01:00:05,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wanted to buy it.

792
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:06,803
[SPEAKER_02]: A dollar.

793
01:00:07,444 --> 01:00:10,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I think you have to have what they call a reasonable price.

794
01:00:10,465 --> 01:00:11,966
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be a reasonable... Two dollars?

795
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:13,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Two dollars.

796
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:15,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've got some peanuts too.

797
01:00:16,891 --> 01:00:19,674
[SPEAKER_02]: 38 Studios had their own social media platform called Helios.

798
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:21,136
[SPEAKER_02]: No buyer.

799
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:24,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Intellectual Property Rights for Catan.

800
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,281
[SPEAKER_02]: No buyer.

801
01:00:25,861 --> 01:00:27,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And the big huge game engine.

802
01:00:27,804 --> 01:00:28,324
[SPEAKER_02]: No buyer.

803
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:29,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they sell anything?

804
01:00:29,986 --> 01:00:30,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they did.

805
01:00:30,846 --> 01:00:38,852
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold a lot that included Rise of Nations and Rise of Legends, those games and the associated intellectual properties.

806
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:45,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other one that they sold was for the Big Huge Games trademark itself, which is kind of a catchy name for a game studio.

807
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:47,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Catan would have been fun.

808
01:00:47,819 --> 01:00:48,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Catan.

809
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they already had Catan.

810
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:50,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

811
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:51,241
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it.

812
01:00:51,762 --> 01:00:53,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It was for the rights for that.

813
01:00:53,643 --> 01:00:53,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

814
01:00:54,944 --> 01:01:03,627
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, apparently there were, I guess, five parties that were actually participating in the auction, but over 20 parties had expressed interest.

815
01:01:03,987 --> 01:01:16,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, what did sell went for $320,000, which might not sound too bad, but apparently Rhode Island, the debt they owe Rhode Island, $100 million.

816
01:01:16,212 --> 01:01:16,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's...

817
01:01:17,372 --> 01:01:20,093
[SPEAKER_02]: practically pennies on the debt that they actually owe.

818
01:01:20,953 --> 01:01:21,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

819
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:28,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the state will continue to negotiate with interested parties to try to sell that which was unsold thus far.

820
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:30,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes.

821
01:01:31,435 --> 01:01:34,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the state of Rhode Island could turn into Big Huge Games.

822
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:38,416
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just... Big Island.

823
01:01:38,456 --> 01:01:39,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Island games.

824
01:01:39,976 --> 01:01:40,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

825
01:01:40,956 --> 01:01:41,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Island?

826
01:01:41,756 --> 01:01:42,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Big?

827
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:42,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

828
01:01:42,857 --> 01:01:43,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

829
01:01:44,077 --> 01:01:44,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really an island?

830
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:46,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

831
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:49,557
[SPEAKER_02]: And its name wasn't really Rhode Island either.

832
01:01:49,597 --> 01:01:55,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhode Island's short for its full name, which is... Oh, God, I'm going to make myself look stupid.

833
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:56,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocky Rhode Island.

834
01:01:56,419 --> 01:01:59,620
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Rhode Island and something plantations.

835
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:03,302
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

836
01:02:03,382 --> 01:02:04,702
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we just move on?

837
01:02:05,323 --> 01:02:07,283
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I don't want to look stupid here on OLR.

838
01:02:07,383 --> 01:02:09,564
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going on Wikipedia.

839
01:02:10,345 --> 01:02:12,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from California, all right?

840
01:02:13,346 --> 01:02:13,606
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

841
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:14,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the crap it means.

842
01:02:15,006 --> 01:02:17,327
[SPEAKER_02]: The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

843
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,348
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the full name of the state.

844
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:20,303
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

845
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:46,182
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to sell the state to get out of debt for that game.

846
01:02:46,382 --> 01:02:48,922
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have to get a triple mortgage on their state.

847
01:02:49,222 --> 01:02:49,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

848
01:02:49,622 --> 01:02:50,203
[SPEAKER_02]: This just in.

849
01:02:50,243 --> 01:02:52,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhode Island is now a part of New Jersey.

850
01:02:54,443 --> 01:02:56,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that they'd stoop that low.

851
01:02:57,124 --> 01:02:57,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

852
01:02:57,504 --> 01:02:58,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Love you, New Jersey.

853
01:02:58,424 --> 01:02:58,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Kidding.

854
01:02:59,024 --> 01:02:59,825
[SPEAKER_02]: She's kidding, people.

855
01:02:59,845 --> 01:03:00,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Kidding.

856
01:03:00,445 --> 01:03:00,785
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

857
01:03:01,045 --> 01:03:02,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about terrorism?

858
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:04,425
[SPEAKER_02]: The state of Rhode Island and New Jersey plantations.

859
01:03:04,766 --> 01:03:05,646
[SPEAKER_05]: How about terrorism?

860
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:06,126
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

861
01:03:06,146 --> 01:03:06,526
[SPEAKER_02]: How about it?

862
01:03:07,506 --> 01:03:09,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the NSA has a new bestie.

863
01:03:10,427 --> 01:03:11,107
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who it is?

864
01:03:12,187 --> 01:03:12,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

865
01:03:15,388 --> 01:03:21,130
[SPEAKER_05]: The NSA is going on World of Warcraft and other online games to look for terrorists.

866
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is America and we're afraid of terrorists.

867
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:24,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

868
01:03:26,391 --> 01:03:30,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just American agencies as well, it's British agencies too.

869
01:03:30,415 --> 01:03:36,059
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently it's this whole Anglo-Saxon descent stupidity thing, I don't know.

870
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:47,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So the NSA and the Government Communications Headquarters in the UK have been monitoring activity and harvesting data from World of Warcraft and Second Life.

871
01:03:48,088 --> 01:04:01,730
[SPEAKER_05]: and apparently some other games that they're trying to see if they're I guess if terrorists are trying to fish for information through MMOs just by posing as a regular player.

872
01:04:02,991 --> 01:04:05,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of in my life.

873
01:04:06,191 --> 01:04:15,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that our tax money could be spent on better things and I want to know if they worked out anything with Blizzard to actually set that up or any of these other ones.

874
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Blizzard came out and said they didn't know.

875
01:04:41,235 --> 01:04:51,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems to me that they are really just picking anything that they can.

876
01:04:52,681 --> 01:05:01,046
[SPEAKER_05]: But they said that basically where they got the legal ability to do that was because of a 1981 executive order signed by Ronald Reagan.

877
01:05:02,306 --> 01:05:08,271
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not only did he ruin our economy, he also did that too, that gave it authority to collect the data.

878
01:05:08,932 --> 01:05:12,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So privacy groups are basically, you know, stepping in and what?

879
01:05:13,462 --> 01:05:14,643
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a real forward thinker.

880
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:17,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And the ability to spy on World of Warcraft.

881
01:05:17,866 --> 01:05:20,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what World of Warcraft is, but someday this will mean something.

882
01:05:24,111 --> 01:05:30,076
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, and I'm just going to read this line in this article here from Computer World.

883
01:05:30,557 --> 01:05:40,305
[SPEAKER_05]: In one document from around that time, the NSA talked about how it was able to gather information on user accounts, characters, and guilds related to known Islamic extremist groups by monitoring World of Warcraft.

884
01:05:40,325 --> 01:05:40,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

885
01:05:40,866 --> 01:05:41,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Really.

886
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:44,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

887
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:45,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't

888
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:08,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Well said, sir.

889
01:06:08,816 --> 01:06:09,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Well said.

890
01:06:10,839 --> 01:06:11,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

891
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I think part of this is overblown.

892
01:06:16,104 --> 01:06:16,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be honest.

893
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:24,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I think part of this is overblown because I don't think the NSA was necessarily paying a whole bunch of people to sit around in cubicles and play World of Warcraft all day.

894
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that was quite what they were doing.

895
01:06:25,835 --> 01:06:26,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Dream job.

896
01:06:26,555 --> 01:06:29,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they trying to hack into it?

897
01:06:29,216 --> 01:06:29,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Possible.

898
01:06:29,697 --> 01:06:32,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's probably more what's going on with our gold farms.

899
01:06:32,658 --> 01:06:38,581
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they were taking data feeds and whatnot and user logs.

900
01:06:38,721 --> 01:06:48,866
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, it wouldn't be out of the question that they would have people who are actually trying to communicate with groups that were

901
01:06:49,366 --> 01:06:50,887
[SPEAKER_05]: are flagged with a certain name.

902
01:06:51,547 --> 01:06:52,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't hear me out here.

903
01:06:52,988 --> 01:06:58,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I'm saying it's not as bad as you think, I'm not saying it's appropriate because I kind of don't agree.

904
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:00,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like, well, what good did it do?

905
01:07:01,232 --> 01:07:02,112
[SPEAKER_02]: What did we stop?

906
01:07:02,153 --> 01:07:06,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know there's those people out there that are like, lol, let's do a controversial name for our guild.

907
01:07:07,195 --> 01:07:07,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

908
01:07:07,615 --> 01:07:09,496
[SPEAKER_05]: We are, you know, Pony Jihad or something.

909
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:11,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's tons of trolls online.

910
01:07:11,117 --> 01:07:12,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck if they were, you know...

911
01:07:13,298 --> 01:07:14,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Spying on Xbox Live, man.

912
01:07:14,919 --> 01:07:16,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's a terrorist on there.

913
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:16,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, though.

914
01:07:16,981 --> 01:07:19,363
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference between a terrorist and an asshole.

915
01:07:19,543 --> 01:07:24,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We've heard of people that have committed hideous crimes that happen to be World of Warcraft players.

916
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:26,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an unfortunate coincidence.

917
01:07:26,188 --> 01:07:32,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe, I really hope I'm not misspeaking here, but there's unfortunately so many crappy people in the world.

918
01:07:32,472 --> 01:07:32,692
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

919
01:07:52,092 --> 01:07:53,893
[SPEAKER_02]: That question is not being answered.

920
01:07:54,314 --> 01:07:59,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And not even the Warcraft transcripts, assumably, that they subpoenaed were able to answer that question.

921
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:05,341
[SPEAKER_02]: But my point is that they're able to get that information when they need it, when the police has it or whatever.

922
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:10,204
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as prevention stuff goes, we're not seeing that anything was prevented.

923
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:12,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that guy did what he did.

924
01:08:12,345 --> 01:08:14,467
[SPEAKER_05]: His chat log would be like, LFR sucks.

925
01:08:15,456 --> 01:08:16,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably not very interesting.

926
01:08:16,597 --> 01:08:17,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Dot's running out.

927
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:17,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

928
01:08:18,938 --> 01:08:19,799
[SPEAKER_02]: This tank sucks.

929
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:20,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he'll please.

930
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,601
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll please, yeah, thank you.

931
01:08:22,721 --> 01:08:29,685
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, it's just... But... I don't know where I was going with this.

932
01:08:29,765 --> 01:08:30,486
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing's just...

933
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:32,521
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

934
01:08:50,816 --> 01:08:52,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I remembered what it was I wanted to say.

935
01:08:52,357 --> 01:08:57,342
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing you should be aware of is that your conversations that you have in these MMOs, they're not private.

936
01:08:57,422 --> 01:08:58,704
[SPEAKER_02]: They are being tracked.

937
01:08:59,144 --> 01:09:05,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And if something ever happened to you or you did something, they will get the records and look at every chat you've had.

938
01:09:06,251 --> 01:09:09,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be whether you were cybering with somebody or what.

939
01:09:09,834 --> 01:09:12,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the stuff you do when you put that information on a server, it's not private.

940
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:43,222
[SPEAKER_02]: emails not private really in that regard I mean you could go and subpoena those companies too and so forth so you know just be aware if you think you're having these ultra private conversations on these websites you're not nope so alright however I do have a resource for people who want to stay hidden on the internet and it's actually a tumblr called we are hidden well you could also just take that plug that's in the back of your computer that attaches to the internet and you can unplug it and there you go

941
01:09:44,244 --> 01:09:48,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, for people who are paranoid about that, there's a resource out there.

942
01:09:49,169 --> 01:09:51,933
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're really paranoid about being on the internet, don't be on the internet.

943
01:09:52,153 --> 01:09:54,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

944
01:09:54,576 --> 01:09:55,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Do or don't.

945
01:09:56,418 --> 01:10:02,906
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the world we live in today, you really can't not be on the internet and participate in modern society.

946
01:10:03,977 --> 01:10:04,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I know.

947
01:10:04,838 --> 01:10:06,779
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, don't have a Facebook.

948
01:10:06,879 --> 01:10:09,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I know plenty of people that don't use Facebook or any of that stuff, you know, so.

949
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:10,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

950
01:10:11,162 --> 01:10:13,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook is its own can of worms.

951
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:14,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.

952
01:10:14,504 --> 01:10:16,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear that thing this week?

953
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:24,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if it's true or not, but that Facebook actually can see, like, if you type a status and you delete it, they still track, like, what you were going to post.

954
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:28,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they were doing some type of weird, like, tracking thing behind the scenes.

955
01:10:28,652 --> 01:10:29,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear I saw some article on that.

956
01:10:29,953 --> 01:10:31,674
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a lot of me bitching about people.

957
01:10:31,914 --> 01:10:35,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, and I'm thinking like, wow, mine's going to be really awful.

958
01:10:37,497 --> 01:10:40,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I write a lot of very angry things that I delete and don't post on Facebook.

959
01:10:40,879 --> 01:10:41,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a good little vent.

960
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:44,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to go back to LiveJournal if that's the case.

961
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:44,742
[SPEAKER_05]: LiveJournal.

962
01:10:44,762 --> 01:10:45,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's all go back to LiveJournal.

963
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:48,744
[SPEAKER_05]: LiveJournal is going to be like, what the hell are all these people?

964
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:49,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Facebook, right.

965
01:10:51,409 --> 01:10:56,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf, our pal in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, sure you can participate in modern society without the internet.

966
01:10:56,731 --> 01:10:57,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Old people do it all the time.

967
01:10:58,831 --> 01:10:59,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Even my mom.

968
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,072
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hardly modern society, Bob.

969
01:11:01,092 --> 01:11:03,013
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom's on Twitter, for God's sake.

970
01:11:05,213 --> 01:11:08,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I want to see what Ellen is tweeting about, Rob.

971
01:11:09,135 --> 01:11:10,175
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I join the Twitters?

972
01:11:12,594 --> 01:11:13,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I love your mom.

973
01:11:13,254 --> 01:11:13,615
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

974
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:15,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

975
01:11:15,236 --> 01:11:15,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

976
01:11:16,657 --> 01:11:18,017
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

977
01:11:19,478 --> 01:11:20,259
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see.

978
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about... I just lost... What happened here?

979
01:11:25,562 --> 01:11:26,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Something moved.

980
01:11:26,343 --> 01:11:27,663
[SPEAKER_07]: The NSA.

981
01:11:28,244 --> 01:11:29,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn you, NSA.

982
01:11:29,605 --> 01:11:32,066
[SPEAKER_07]: No, let's talk a little bit about SteamOS.

983
01:11:32,086 --> 01:11:32,947
[SPEAKER_07]: That just came out.

984
01:11:32,967 --> 01:11:34,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least they have the beta test out there.

985
01:11:35,336 --> 01:11:53,074
[SPEAKER_07]: and they also shipped out those 300 steam machines sadly not to my house I am disappointed but yes you can actually check it out if you don't have a steam machine to test out on you can download it now and yeah

986
01:11:55,123 --> 01:12:03,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, one of the things about the Steam OS is they're not trying to be a replacement for your own OS that you have right now.

987
01:12:03,728 --> 01:12:07,790
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is a good, I guess, alternative for gaming or something.

988
01:12:08,811 --> 01:12:09,551
[SPEAKER_07]: But check it out.

989
01:12:10,371 --> 01:12:15,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And they even have... Those Steam machines out there, they sound pretty sweet.

990
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:17,815
[SPEAKER_07]: And they came in like a wooden crate and everything.

991
01:12:18,296 --> 01:12:20,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so fucking disappointed that I didn't get one.

992
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:21,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Second to use a new computer.

993
01:12:22,058 --> 01:12:22,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

994
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:24,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really sad I didn't get one either, but it is what it is.

995
01:12:27,662 --> 01:12:30,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we heard anything about people that are actually using SteamOS?

996
01:12:30,283 --> 01:12:34,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know it's out there, but I'm not hearing a lot of reviews on it or anything, like how it works.

997
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:35,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard anything yet.

998
01:12:35,927 --> 01:12:40,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess a lot of people are just hesitant to use it because it's like, well, I'm not going to exactly overwrite Windows with SteamOS.

999
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:44,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't have a second computer for it, then what can you do?

1000
01:12:44,233 --> 01:12:49,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not necessarily because I think you can multi-boot into that stuff and do it that way.

1001
01:12:51,177 --> 01:13:17,113
[SPEAKER_07]: but I'm not really sure how I haven't messed with Steam or I haven't messed with Linux in a long time last time I tried to mess with Linux is when I heard that Linux would allow me to somehow mount the file system on some DDR disk I don't remember, something had to do with Dance Dance Revolution hacking that but uh yeah that was that um

1002
01:13:17,822 --> 01:13:18,202
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1003
01:13:18,783 --> 01:13:20,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to try to move on.

1004
01:13:20,203 --> 01:13:23,245
[SPEAKER_02]: For our live listeners, the podcasts only will hear this.

1005
01:13:23,325 --> 01:13:24,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Our live stream just dropped completely.

1006
01:13:24,986 --> 01:13:26,527
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't connect to our streaming server.

1007
01:13:26,887 --> 01:13:30,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not even my internet because I still see IRC and everything and everybody's freaking out.

1008
01:13:30,549 --> 01:13:31,410
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't even connect.

1009
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:32,911
[SPEAKER_03]: The NSA shut us down.

1010
01:13:33,311 --> 01:13:34,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they did.

1011
01:13:35,072 --> 01:13:35,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, would you mind?

1012
01:13:35,752 --> 01:13:36,853
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to flip the script a little bit.

1013
01:13:36,873 --> 01:13:38,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you go to your story next?

1014
01:13:38,234 --> 01:13:39,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose I could do such a thing.

1015
01:13:39,735 --> 01:13:43,517
[SPEAKER_02]: While I try to fix what's going on here, even though it might be out of my control.

1016
01:13:46,000 --> 01:14:00,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Firefly Online is going to be a thing and it is launching in summer 2014 by developer QMX and it's going to be on iOS and Android but they are going to be expanding onto PC and Mac and may include other platforms.

1017
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there's not a lot of information out other than soon, but basically it's going to be you get your ship, you get your crew, you have to keep them happy, you have to trade, craft, collect, fly around the verse, and you also have a freeform flight simulator built into it.

1018
01:14:23,145 --> 01:14:44,820
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh they're basically uh saying that it's going to be uh you know when you start off you're basically going to be kind of another version of the Firefly crew you play as a brown coat captain and then you get other factions through later DLC releases but um it sounds kind of fun I'm looking forward to it I might play it because I love Firefly it's the Joss

1019
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:56,570
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really cool news for those that were, because, you know, obviously, that show had a huge cult to it, and people want to see it come back, and they want to see, you know, what's... The comic's coming out, too.

1020
01:14:56,911 --> 01:14:57,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1021
01:14:57,251 --> 01:14:58,652
[SPEAKER_05]: That's based after the movie.

1022
01:14:58,752 --> 01:15:03,076
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, what a nice way to kind of at least continue the story, because we all know, like, the show can't come back.

1023
01:15:03,176 --> 01:15:04,578
[SPEAKER_02]: All those actors are on to new things.

1024
01:15:04,598 --> 01:15:05,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it just, it's not going to happen.

1025
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:08,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't Marina Baccarin, like, super pregnant right now?

1026
01:15:09,002 --> 01:15:09,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

1027
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:10,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she's super pregnant right now.

1028
01:15:10,843 --> 01:15:11,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.

1029
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:13,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Although her hair grew back.

1030
01:15:14,588 --> 01:15:15,809
[SPEAKER_05]: She had long hair in the last picture I saw.

1031
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:21,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this is a great way for people to at least continue that.

1032
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:24,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird to me that an MMO for Firefly didn't happen sooner.

1033
01:15:25,236 --> 01:15:25,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1034
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:52,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Why you're nothing but firefly pieces of pudding sitting on a plate.

1035
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:53,763
[SPEAKER_05]: You're custard!

1036
01:15:54,684 --> 01:16:09,853
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but for people who are really into doing things in that universe, there actually is a tabletop game that I want to say, well, the former White Wolf put out, because I think it's the same type of gameplay system as Werewolf and Vampire, those ones.

1037
01:16:10,713 --> 01:16:17,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, there's a comic going to be coming out that's based on the Fallout after the Serenity movie.

1038
01:16:17,897 --> 01:16:22,439
[SPEAKER_05]: So it seems that that universe is getting a lot of love lately.

1039
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:31,602
[SPEAKER_02]: You think the fact that the Avengers is doing well and all that helps kind of bump up Whedon's properties?

1040
01:16:32,262 --> 01:16:32,842
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Joss.

1041
01:16:33,263 --> 01:16:35,143
[SPEAKER_05]: People who love Joss love Joss regardless.

1042
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:42,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the record, I was never a big Buffy fan and I didn't like Angel until its last season because that was when the writers stopped giving a fuck.

1043
01:16:43,186 --> 01:16:44,687
[SPEAKER_05]: That was when we had the Puppet Time episode.

1044
01:16:45,527 --> 01:17:14,587
[SPEAKER_05]: but I loved Firefly I didn't watch Dollhouse but I've liked Joss's writing when he wrote for Astonishing X-Men that's probably the most I've enjoyed any X-Men title like since the Dark Phoenix stuff when I was a little kid so our stream did come back for the live listeners welcome back apparently it was not our fault I don't know what's up with that but anyway going to some comments in our chat room SSJ100 Matt says this still seems like an April Fool's joke is it a joke?

1045
01:17:15,251 --> 01:17:15,511
[SPEAKER_05]: ESGN ESPN

1046
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:40,180
[SPEAKER_02]: ESGN, ESports Global Network

1047
01:17:58,994 --> 01:18:01,517
[SPEAKER_02]: E-sports, of course, is a lot of the head-to-head combat.

1048
01:18:01,537 --> 01:18:04,501
[SPEAKER_02]: You see some of the big games that support this right now.

1049
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:06,904
[SPEAKER_02]: League of Legends, Dota 2, of course.

1050
01:18:06,924 --> 01:18:08,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Those MOBAs are huge for this.

1051
01:18:08,486 --> 01:18:11,489
[SPEAKER_02]: StarCraft 2, World of Warcraft Arena.

1052
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:14,313
[SPEAKER_02]: You see a lot of this being e-sports.

1053
01:18:15,494 --> 01:18:17,796
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked a little bit about this on my other show, Horde House, as well.

1054
01:18:18,056 --> 01:18:21,359
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing now people are getting visas to come into the U.S.

1055
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had a guy for StarCraft II got a visa to come in on that game this week to play that, so that's pretty cool.

1056
01:18:30,186 --> 01:18:38,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, ESGN will be launching at ESGN.com, and ESGNTV.com is the video site for its dedicated 24-hour channel.

1057
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:43,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it is not something that's planned to be on standard television, quote-unquote, but...

1058
01:18:43,576 --> 01:18:49,264
[SPEAKER_02]: What is standard TV anymore in the world of Netflix and Hulu and YouTube and all that?

1059
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:51,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to be a very interesting experiment.

1060
01:18:51,528 --> 01:18:52,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck to them.

1061
01:18:52,369 --> 01:18:53,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know...

1062
01:18:54,324 --> 01:19:03,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we don't talk a lot about StarCraft 2 and League of Legends on this show, but if y'all need three fun and fabulous commentators on a Sunday night, we might be available.

1063
01:19:04,389 --> 01:19:05,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say if the money's right.

1064
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:06,550
[SPEAKER_02]: If the money's right.

1065
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,872
[SPEAKER_02]: All joking aside, let's get to the release dates.

1066
01:19:10,932 --> 01:19:14,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Travel the world and check out what's coming out in a gaming store near you.

1067
01:19:14,413 --> 01:19:16,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not a lot, right, Loki?

1068
01:19:16,654 --> 01:19:17,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not a thing.

1069
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:18,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a thing, huh?

1070
01:19:19,015 --> 01:19:19,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a thing.

1071
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:20,616
[SPEAKER_07]: We are done for the year.

1072
01:19:22,034 --> 01:19:22,796
[SPEAKER_07]: In the US, right?

1073
01:19:22,816 --> 01:19:23,336
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US.

1074
01:19:23,377 --> 01:19:23,697
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US.

1075
01:19:23,777 --> 01:19:28,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, aside from, you know, digital stuff obviously coming out, but nothing at retail.

1076
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:29,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Dragoon 3

1077
01:19:52,491 --> 01:20:02,699
[SPEAKER_02]: A brand new DualShock controller in crystal color comes out, as well as FIFA 14 World Class Soccer Bonus Edition, and Shin Gundam Musou comes out this week as well.

1078
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's still some heavy hitters in Japan the rest of the year.

1079
01:20:05,981 --> 01:20:17,590
[SPEAKER_02]: The day after Christmas, Boxing Day, if you will, for Canada, in Japan they're getting Final Fantasy X and X-2's remasters are out on December 26th, so just barely making it this year, so...

1080
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:20,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Still plenty to come over there.

1081
01:20:20,252 --> 01:20:25,976
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Xbox 360, Band Fused, Rock Legends is there as well, as well as Shooting Love Collection.

1082
01:20:26,736 --> 01:20:31,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And going over to the Vita, on the PlayStation Vita this week, Amnesia V Edition.

1083
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the same Amnesia that is the scary game that we have here?

1084
01:20:36,263 --> 01:20:36,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it is.

1085
01:20:37,704 --> 01:20:38,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not.

1086
01:20:38,345 --> 01:20:41,707
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more based off an anime, I believe, with a lot of cards.

1087
01:20:42,267 --> 01:20:42,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like this guy...

1088
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:45,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did all my cards go?

1089
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:46,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did these come from?

1090
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:48,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1091
01:20:50,152 --> 01:20:51,733
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a crap ton on the Vita this week.

1092
01:20:52,074 --> 01:20:53,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead or Alive 5 gets a price reduction.

1093
01:20:54,615 --> 01:20:57,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Diabolic Lovers Limited V Edition comes out this week.

1094
01:20:58,718 --> 01:21:04,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Geki Johan Mahou Shoujo Madoka That's Magica The Battle Pentagram comes out this week.

1095
01:21:04,862 --> 01:21:09,265
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big anime series that half my friends on Tumblr are losing their shit over.

1096
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:13,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Hakoyuki Kuyokoroku Injustice Kudwafter Kudwafter

1097
01:21:29,235 --> 01:21:29,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck Yes Madoka

[SPEAKER_02]: Shin Gundam Musou comes out this week on the Vita as well.

1099
01:21:51,276 --> 01:21:51,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, Gundam.

1100
01:21:52,156 --> 01:21:53,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Busy, busy week on the Vita.

1101
01:21:53,497 --> 01:21:57,039
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Wii U, nothing, sorry.

1102
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:06,405
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Nintendo 3DS, however, High School D x D, Koneku no Album, My Little Cat comes out in Japan.

1103
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:07,786
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a kiddie game.

1104
01:22:07,806 --> 01:22:08,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to see what this is.

1105
01:22:09,587 --> 01:22:10,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

1106
01:22:10,568 --> 01:22:11,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

1107
01:22:11,188 --> 01:22:12,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I am flailing.

1108
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:13,389
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks amazing.

1109
01:22:13,489 --> 01:22:14,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I need this in my life.

1110
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:15,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I need this in my life.

1111
01:22:16,691 --> 01:22:19,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone get me a Japanese 3DS.

1112
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:20,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1113
01:22:21,113 --> 01:22:23,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like... It's kitties in fancy hats.

1114
01:22:23,134 --> 01:22:30,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like real pictures of cats in like sailor suits and pink hats and like orange Halloween sweaters.

1115
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:32,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't even look like they're going to murder you.

1116
01:22:32,919 --> 01:22:35,660
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this is what it comes to.

1117
01:22:36,061 --> 01:22:38,642
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why Swapnil was removed.

1118
01:22:40,429 --> 01:22:44,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to link that to our chatters right now so they can take a look at that.

1119
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:47,644
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room is harassing me into watching Madoka.

1120
01:22:48,692 --> 01:22:49,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I need this in my life.

1121
01:22:49,493 --> 01:22:56,136
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means that's going to be the next thing I have to marathon since I marathoned all of Shingeki no Kyojin so far and Claymore.

1122
01:22:56,336 --> 01:22:57,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Who makes this game?

1123
01:22:57,657 --> 01:22:58,298
[SPEAKER_02]: MTO.

1124
01:22:58,538 --> 01:23:00,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recognize that name.

1125
01:23:00,459 --> 01:23:02,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking on the box art.

1126
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:03,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loves MTO.

1127
01:23:04,161 --> 01:23:05,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have a Twitter or something?

1128
01:23:05,322 --> 01:23:06,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I want this game.

1129
01:23:06,562 --> 01:23:07,923
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to petition for that.

1130
01:23:08,323 --> 01:23:12,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh my god, thank you for posting a picture of Redertainment.

1131
01:23:12,766 --> 01:23:16,168
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to harass them like we did for President Cat.

1132
01:23:18,322 --> 01:23:19,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I still want to play that game too.

1133
01:23:21,844 --> 01:23:23,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I want that in my life.

1134
01:23:25,446 --> 01:23:27,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Koneko no Album, My Little Cat.

1135
01:23:28,927 --> 01:23:29,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Koneko means kitten.

1136
01:23:30,868 --> 01:23:34,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I wonder if it's just like you take pictures of your own cat and then this program helps you.

1137
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:36,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Putting Midna in outfits!

1138
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:38,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, that's gonna be great!

1139
01:23:38,812 --> 01:23:39,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

1140
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:41,500
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys.

1141
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what to do with you.

1142
01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:47,302
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, did you know that A Legend of Zelda The Link Between Worlds is still not out in Japan?

1143
01:23:47,362 --> 01:23:49,083
[SPEAKER_02]: They will not be getting that until December 26th.

1144
01:23:49,263 --> 01:23:52,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to put Midna in a frilly little dress.

1145
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:54,844
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to murder the shit out of me in my sleep.

1146
01:23:55,244 --> 01:23:56,545
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not going to drop this all night.

1147
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:58,105
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be Midna.

1148
01:23:58,525 --> 01:23:58,966
Mom!

1149
01:23:59,466 --> 01:23:59,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Mom!

1150
01:24:00,306 --> 01:24:00,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Mom!

1151
01:24:01,066 --> 01:24:01,606
[SPEAKER_05]: This sucks.

1152
01:24:02,907 --> 01:24:03,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's how she talks.

1153
01:24:04,007 --> 01:24:05,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Is AkumaJP helping us out here?

1154
01:24:05,588 --> 01:24:06,768
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this link he just gave us?

1155
01:24:07,768 --> 01:24:08,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1156
01:24:08,509 --> 01:24:14,353
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know AkumaJP is over there and maybe can... Are... Is this... Oh my god!

1157
01:24:14,773 --> 01:24:17,635
[SPEAKER_05]: They're ID pictures and you can make one look like a Bosozoku.

1158
01:24:18,776 --> 01:24:20,277
[SPEAKER_02]: This is outstanding.

1159
01:24:21,559 --> 01:24:23,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, somebody get me a Japanese 3DS and this game.

1160
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,442
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to do with cats being adorable.

1161
01:24:26,823 --> 01:24:28,584
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet would eat this shit up.

1162
01:24:28,604 --> 01:24:29,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that picture.

1163
01:24:29,885 --> 01:24:31,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like they're dressed up as Bosozoku.

1164
01:24:31,586 --> 01:24:32,306
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so awesome.

1165
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:33,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Horrible radio.

1166
01:24:33,147 --> 01:24:33,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you guys.

1167
01:24:33,887 --> 01:24:35,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

1168
01:24:35,648 --> 01:24:43,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe what I can do, I can beg Jason to maybe take some of these links and put some of the pictures in the YouTube.

1169
01:24:43,734 --> 01:24:45,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And put them on our Tumblr.

1170
01:24:45,775 --> 01:24:48,039
[SPEAKER_02]: or just look it up again for yourself.

1171
01:24:48,339 --> 01:24:49,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Look it up for yourself, the game.

1172
01:24:50,903 --> 01:24:53,087
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out there on your favorite import gaming website.

1173
01:24:53,347 --> 01:24:55,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I gotta get through some PSP games though.

1174
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:55,891
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

1175
01:24:56,151 --> 01:24:58,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm inspired to dress up Midna on her Tumblr.

1176
01:24:59,586 --> 01:25:22,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Some PSP games, as if the Vita wasn't enough, you also have After School, Colorful Step, Undou Yubu comes out this week, Lovely Quest Unlimited, Nobunaga no Yabu Sosensoku with a power-up kit comes out this week, that's a price reduction actually, and Ore no Kanojo no Uro Omote, Pure Sweetheart comes out on the PSP this week, still kicking in Japan.

1177
01:25:22,983 --> 01:25:23,944
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

1178
01:25:24,634 --> 01:25:26,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I need the kiddie game.

1179
01:25:26,614 --> 01:25:27,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1180
01:25:27,235 --> 01:25:27,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1181
01:25:29,495 --> 01:25:31,495
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 18th, we have Zen Pinball 2.

1182
01:25:32,115 --> 01:25:34,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 19th, Colossatron, Massive World Threat.

1183
01:25:34,856 --> 01:25:36,376
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a cool name, Colossatron.

1184
01:25:36,976 --> 01:25:40,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on Wii U, we have Knit Underground, K-N-Y-T-T.

1185
01:25:41,397 --> 01:25:45,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Ridge Racer Slipstream for the Android, iPad, and iPhone.

1186
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:49,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And nothing else until... Xmas.

1187
01:25:50,139 --> 01:25:50,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Xmas.

1188
01:25:52,429 --> 01:25:54,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should call it Extifermas and worship Extifer.

1189
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:56,391
[SPEAKER_02]: We might do that on Horde House this week.

1190
01:25:56,912 --> 01:25:59,573
[SPEAKER_02]: We are having a holiday special on Horde House this week.

1191
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:01,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be on a holiday special.

1192
01:26:01,975 --> 01:26:02,255
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1193
01:26:02,995 --> 01:26:03,415
[SPEAKER_02]: At school.

1194
01:26:03,635 --> 01:26:08,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, which may or may not have to do with cats.

1195
01:26:09,219 --> 01:26:16,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sony has patented a brand new, looks like a Move controller.

1196
01:26:19,036 --> 01:26:29,725
[SPEAKER_07]: The difference being that instead of having an analog stick on that one side, the main difference is it's going to have a touchpad, kind of like how they have on the Vita and on the front of the PlayStation 4 controllers.

1197
01:26:43,576 --> 01:26:56,335
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe, it makes sense if you think about it, because now they will need some sort of extra input, you know, to cover, you know, PlayStation 4 games that use the move controller.

1198
01:26:56,756 --> 01:26:58,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe this is what this is about.

1199
01:27:01,434 --> 01:27:08,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really do a lot of games use the move controller.

1200
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:17,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they going to start bringing it back like how they did with Resistance and Killzone and stuff where they have a giant fucking gun that looked ridiculous with the move controllers in there?

1201
01:27:17,918 --> 01:27:24,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of got the feeling they were trying to kind of get rid of the move, kind of shove that under the rug or something.

1202
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,700
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the impression I was getting.

1203
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:27,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe not.

1204
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:29,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1205
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:31,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1206
01:27:32,401 --> 01:27:35,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm trying to do a little research on this game company that makes this game.

1207
01:27:35,082 --> 01:27:37,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I found their websites and I'm trying to see if they have a Twitter.

1208
01:27:37,082 --> 01:27:37,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's a Facebook.

1209
01:27:38,442 --> 01:27:39,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to find a Twitter.

1210
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:41,103
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a dog one too!

1211
01:27:41,912 --> 01:28:11,313
[SPEAKER_02]: yes there's dress your oh my gosh but the kitty one's the best okay but this is good because now I can give out this URL so the podcast listeners can be like what the hell are they freaking out about so I'm gonna I'm gonna just totally give them a free plug here on the show because they're they make games to dress up your kitties and doggies mto-power.com that's mto-power.com is the maker of these games and there's got to be a way to to send them a message and let them know we want these games in America I have hiccups now

1212
01:28:12,403 --> 01:28:13,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the cute kitties give you...

1213
01:28:15,778 --> 01:28:17,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't burp on the microphone!

1214
01:28:18,279 --> 01:28:21,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Burping is a good way to get rid of hiccups.

1215
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:24,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I never, ever said I was ladylike.

1216
01:28:25,181 --> 01:28:25,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

1217
01:28:26,362 --> 01:28:27,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

1218
01:28:27,222 --> 01:28:28,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Tigerclaw, for linking it in the chatroom.

1219
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:31,763
[SPEAKER_02]: One more story for you guys.

1220
01:28:31,783 --> 01:28:34,484
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of those gaming good news stories.

1221
01:28:34,544 --> 01:28:36,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank heavens.

1222
01:28:36,505 --> 01:28:42,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaming exercise games, whether you love them or you're sick of hearing about them, they do a lot of good for our community.

1223
01:28:43,287 --> 01:28:47,332
[SPEAKER_02]: and a new study is out this week about Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus.

1224
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:57,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Wii Fit Plus was available on the Nintendo Wii and now they have the newer version that's on the Wii U. I believe the demo's done, but you can check that out too.

1225
01:28:57,945 --> 01:28:58,426
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the Wii U.

1226
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:07,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they say that Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus improves the lives of patients with type 2 diabetes and helps control their blood sugar levels.

1227
01:29:08,254 --> 01:29:15,600
[SPEAKER_02]: This is by BMC and Doctrine Disorders who carried out the trial with 220 participants for a period of 12 weeks.

1228
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:24,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Half were asked to use Wii Fit Plus for half an hour a day and the second half were under routine care and just, you know, got everything 12 weeks later.

1229
01:29:25,889 --> 01:29:30,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that actually got the fitness game lost weight and improved their blood sugar levels.

1230
01:29:31,246 --> 01:29:32,026
[SPEAKER_04]: because guess what?

1231
01:29:32,566 --> 01:29:33,527
[SPEAKER_04]: They were doing exercise.

1232
01:29:33,547 --> 01:29:33,967
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1233
01:29:34,107 --> 01:29:34,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1234
01:29:34,607 --> 01:29:39,248
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the thing is I kind of look at this and go, well, duh, exercise leads to good things.

1235
01:29:39,488 --> 01:29:41,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, of course, this is what happened.

1236
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:45,190
[SPEAKER_02]: When you give the people the stuff for free, I guess there's more incentive to play that.

1237
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:52,472
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyhow, experts noted that the daily physical activity increased, mental health and subjective well-being increased as well.

1238
01:29:52,972 --> 01:29:55,713
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of patients suffering from depression decreased.

1239
01:29:56,553 --> 01:29:59,794
[SPEAKER_02]: However, interesting, a third of the patients dropped out of the trial.

1240
01:30:00,554 --> 01:30:05,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning that people retaining the same level of enthusiasm over a sustained period of time was difficult.

1241
01:30:06,876 --> 01:30:09,796
[SPEAKER_02]: According to Dr. Richard Elliott, who's with Diabetes UK, So,

1242
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:24,181
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what whatever gets people motivated right

1243
01:30:37,216 --> 01:30:43,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, the biggest thing is exercise and cutting out the sugar.

1244
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:45,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Because guess what diabetes is?

1245
01:30:46,248 --> 01:30:47,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Problem with insulin.

1246
01:30:49,493 --> 01:30:52,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Although if you have type 1 diabetes, cutting out the extra sugar is not always good for you.

1247
01:30:53,430 --> 01:31:00,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, moving on to a more simple time when we weren't really able to interact with our games, unless it was Dance Aerobics.

1248
01:31:00,571 --> 01:31:02,532
[SPEAKER_05]: When Diabetes was Wilford Brimley.

1249
01:31:02,632 --> 01:31:03,132
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1250
01:31:04,032 --> 01:31:05,252
[SPEAKER_02]: The Classic Game of the Week.

1251
01:31:05,932 --> 01:31:12,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week, DarkSakura goes into the Classic Gaming Vault and finds one game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game.

1252
01:31:12,614 --> 01:31:13,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of eating all that candy.

1253
01:31:13,914 --> 01:31:14,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Write the F now.

1254
01:31:15,814 --> 01:31:19,335
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1255
01:31:19,515 --> 01:31:20,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Poll position.

1256
01:31:21,078 --> 01:31:22,739
[SPEAKER_02]: A very true classic indeed.

1257
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:23,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1258
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:25,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it's an arcade racer.

1259
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:25,700
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out in 1982.

1260
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:30,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that intro music because that's the only music in the game.

1261
01:31:30,642 --> 01:31:31,803
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much the only music in the game.

1262
01:31:31,843 --> 01:31:33,523
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of it is just squeaky noises.

1263
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:37,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep it really low in the background just in case.

1264
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:39,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It was manufactured by Atari.

1265
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:41,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, worldwide by Namco.

1266
01:31:41,207 --> 01:31:42,447
[SPEAKER_05]: In the U.S., it was done by Atari.

1267
01:31:43,448 --> 01:31:47,249
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually the most popular coin-op game in 1983.

1268
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:58,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has an upright cabinet or an environmental cockpit cabinet, which my Chuck E. Cheese's slash Showbiz Pizza in Mobile, Alabama had one forever.

1269
01:31:59,094 --> 01:31:59,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

1270
01:31:59,535 --> 01:32:00,655
[SPEAKER_05]: They still fucking have it.

1271
01:32:01,255 --> 01:32:01,976
[SPEAKER_05]: The same one.

1272
01:32:02,936 --> 01:32:03,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just surprised it works.

1273
01:32:05,677 --> 01:32:09,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically you have the accelerator, you have a brake pedal, and you have your wheel.

1274
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:23,584
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was the highest-grossing arcade game in North America in 1983, and it sold 21,000 machines for $61 million, equivalent to 2012's $140 million.

1275
01:32:24,024 --> 01:32:25,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So just put it in modern money.

1276
01:32:26,665 --> 01:32:30,306
[SPEAKER_05]: The most successful racing game of its time, pretty much.

1277
01:32:30,466 --> 01:32:34,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had a Saturday morning cartoon, which I watched the hell out of, and have every episode of downloaded.

1278
01:32:34,947 --> 01:32:35,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus it had a cool intro.

1279
01:32:37,308 --> 01:32:54,991
[SPEAKER_05]: um it uh basically pole position I think was the big inspiration for most of the modern driving games that we have now so basically in the game you have a formula one race car and you do a time trial lap to qualify for um the Fuji racetrack and uh

1280
01:32:56,627 --> 01:32:57,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1281
01:33:23,268 --> 01:33:50,302
[SPEAKER_05]: and it also was had it was in full color and had scaling sprites including your race cars and your signs to give you perspective it was for the US release Namco actually approached Bally Midway to either and said okay one of you can get one of these games and so Bally took Mappy and Atari took Pole Position and

1282
01:33:51,903 --> 01:33:57,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so basically, it's been probably one of the most ported systems, too.

1283
01:33:57,788 --> 01:34:02,231
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been put out by Atari Soft and a lot of the home computers and consoles in the early 80s.

1284
01:34:03,072 --> 01:34:08,256
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 90s, there was a pole position on PC that came back in Microsoft's return of arcade.

1285
01:34:08,596 --> 01:34:11,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been on PlayStation, N64, and Dreamcast in the Namco Museum.

1286
01:34:12,539 --> 01:34:16,821
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's also been on PS2, GameCube, GBA and Xbox.

1287
01:34:17,641 --> 01:34:28,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuji Speedway was renamed Namco Speedway in the Museum series and for the Plug and Play series that were part of the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade it was called Blue Speedway.

1288
01:34:29,405 --> 01:34:47,795
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's also a version to work with the Puffer Exercise Bike Controller and it has been put out on iPod back in the day and now we have iOS versions with Pole Position Remix and Pole Position 2, which was the sequel, has also been re-released as well.

1289
01:34:48,295 --> 01:34:52,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, Pole Position 2 being the sequel, it came out in 1983 and let me see...

1290
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate my iPad sometimes.

1291
01:35:00,422 --> 01:35:20,892
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as that, a lot of people are saying that Final Lap is the unofficial Pole Position 3, which is sort of a racing RPG spinoff that came out on the TurboGrafx-16, also known as the PC Engine.

1292
01:35:22,232 --> 01:35:23,913
[SPEAKER_05]: That version was called Final Lap Twin.

1293
01:35:24,854 --> 01:35:32,199
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned earlier, there was Pole Position Remix for iPhone and it had the courses for Pole Position 2 and a new course.

1294
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:38,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was also a cartoon of the same name, like I said, that I watched a bunch of times.

1295
01:35:38,724 --> 01:35:40,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And Pole Position showed up in the movie Daryl.

1296
01:35:42,286 --> 01:35:44,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the movie Daryl?

1297
01:35:44,047 --> 01:35:44,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

1298
01:35:44,648 --> 01:35:45,769
[SPEAKER_05]: The boy who was an android.

1299
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:49,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And he won a very high score in that game.

1300
01:35:49,651 --> 01:35:50,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, Pole Position Remix.

1301
01:35:51,542 --> 01:35:51,882
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1302
01:35:52,423 --> 01:35:52,763
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

1303
01:35:52,803 --> 01:35:54,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Your classic game of the week.

1304
01:35:54,806 --> 01:35:55,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Pole Position.

1305
01:35:56,848 --> 01:35:58,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Available like 11 billion different places.

1306
01:35:58,790 --> 01:35:59,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1307
01:35:59,611 --> 01:36:00,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1308
01:36:00,111 --> 01:36:02,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just because it was the most popular arcade game that year.

1309
01:36:02,634 --> 01:36:03,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it.

1310
01:36:03,235 --> 01:36:04,256
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember it.

1311
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:05,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everywhere.

1312
01:36:05,617 --> 01:36:06,038
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

1313
01:36:06,118 --> 01:36:07,880
[SPEAKER_05]: We built our old main cabinet out of a pole position.

1314
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:08,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1315
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:09,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

1316
01:36:09,741 --> 01:36:11,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Shermie lived in it for a little while.

1317
01:36:11,361 --> 01:36:12,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It was her cat condo, seriously.

1318
01:36:13,502 --> 01:36:15,163
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great use for a pole position machine.

1319
01:36:15,183 --> 01:36:17,964
[SPEAKER_05]: My cat is, you know how fat Shermie was.

1320
01:36:17,984 --> 01:36:18,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.

1321
01:36:18,484 --> 01:36:20,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, how the crap did she get in it?

1322
01:36:21,146 --> 01:36:31,510
[SPEAKER_05]: She found a little door where the pedal was, and she would just live, we had this pole position machine sitting in our apartment for a year it had to be, or at least half a year, and Shermie lived in it.

1323
01:36:33,069 --> 01:36:33,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Cats are amazing.

1324
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:38,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere because when we come back there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1325
01:36:39,055 --> 01:36:45,061
[SPEAKER_02]: More news, the Fuku Question of the Week, your calls, and much more when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1326
01:36:51,448 --> 01:36:51,748
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1327
01:37:11,932 --> 01:37:14,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I live in an interfaith home.

1328
01:37:15,033 --> 01:37:16,753
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a Christmaka family.

1329
01:37:17,414 --> 01:37:17,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1330
01:37:18,054 --> 01:37:18,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is fair.

1331
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:22,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we taught Julian about Hanukkah because he had to study for school.

1332
01:37:23,455 --> 01:37:25,676
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a really good little gambler now with the dreidel.

1333
01:37:26,196 --> 01:37:27,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And he loves guilt.

1334
01:37:27,616 --> 01:37:28,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't?

1335
01:37:28,497 --> 01:37:29,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was going around going...

1336
01:37:33,223 --> 01:37:48,109
[SPEAKER_05]: and Becky and I determined that there's not a we call it the phlegm sound because there's no real translation for phlegm sound from Hebrew to English other than Chanukah

1337
01:37:48,909 --> 01:37:50,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whatever it is you celebrate.

1338
01:37:50,751 --> 01:37:52,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kwanzaa's the 26th.

[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1344
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:05,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a big thank you from all of us to you guys who are such a great support for the show.

[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a really good year this year.

1346
01:38:07,825 --> 01:38:11,648
[SPEAKER_02]: and just additional exposure through Stitcher and podcasts.

1347
01:38:12,468 --> 01:38:18,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I know personally I've met a lot of other great podcasts through GamerX was a great way to connect with a lot of other podcasters.

1348
01:38:18,852 --> 01:38:19,513
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.

1349
01:38:20,533 --> 01:38:21,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And just so on.

1354
01:38:28,958 --> 01:38:29,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember...

1355
01:38:30,419 --> 01:38:31,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Electric Sisterhood was this year.

1356
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:33,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if there was one other one this year, if that was last year.

1357
01:38:33,781 --> 01:38:36,883
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that hopefully continuing to grow into next year.

1358
01:38:36,943 --> 01:38:39,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, yeah, lots of great things happening.

1359

01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:01,820
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

1369

[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever else I end up doing.

1370
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:06,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really hoping to get that New York City trip in this year that I've been needing to take for the past six years.

1371
01:39:08,164 --> 01:39:09,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to go to GamerX.

1372
01:39:09,364 --> 01:39:11,626
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a great OLR family in New York City.

1373
01:39:11,646 --> 01:39:13,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we can make GamerX happen for you.

1374
01:39:13,707 --> 01:39:14,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be easy.

1375

[SPEAKER_02]: So there we go.

1376
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:22,432
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into some more gaming news, some rapid fire news.

1377
01:39:22,512 --> 01:39:26,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to buy Loki a little time because he's taking care of what he has to do for his wisdom teeth.

1378
01:39:26,815 --> 01:39:27,195
[SPEAKER_02]: You all right?

1379
01:39:28,413 --> 01:39:37,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, alright Gotta do your salt water rinse, yep Don't want to get an infection, that's fine, I understand Is shoving all those salted french fries in your mouth Isn't the same effect?

1380
01:39:37,328 --> 01:39:42,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't remember having to do that But I remember them giving me Two different mouthwashes

1381
01:39:43,931 --> 01:39:44,732
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1382
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:14,761
[SPEAKER_07]: and

1383
01:40:16,837 --> 01:40:21,120
[SPEAKER_07]: To celebrate that, I'm not sure if they're releasing on any more platforms here anytime soon.

1384
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:25,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it is on its way to Vita, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4.

1385
01:40:25,964 --> 01:40:27,845
[SPEAKER_07]: So, soon.

1386
01:40:28,726 --> 01:40:29,986
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be even more copies.

1387
01:40:31,488 --> 01:40:32,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Elder Scrolls Online.

1388
01:40:32,588 --> 01:40:35,150
[SPEAKER_07]: They finally announced the launch date of April 4th.

1389
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:37,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, that is going to be a busy month for MMOs.

1390
01:40:38,252 --> 01:40:38,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta say.

1391
01:40:40,414 --> 01:40:42,155
[SPEAKER_07]: PC... Well, that's for PC and Mac.

1392
01:40:42,816 --> 01:40:45,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Next-gen version not coming until June...

1393
01:40:46,358 --> 01:40:51,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're hoping to get on the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, you're going to be waiting a little bit longer.

1394
01:40:52,900 --> 01:41:12,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And last but not least, this is kind of surprising because I remember this game from a while ago when Atari released it, but Mark Echo's Getting Up, contents under pressure, the kind of weird graffiti slash futuristic...

1395
01:41:13,565 --> 01:41:39,098
[SPEAKER_07]: um government totalitarian game um originally like I said put out by Atari and now though the rights have actually been um snatched up and um it's been released onto Steam so you can check it out um thanks to Devolver Digital for publishing that and that's available on Steam and I think it's actually at least it was on sale so um

1396
01:41:40,876 --> 01:41:47,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's still on sale for 50% off, so $7.49 if you want to check out the game if you may have missed it.

1397
01:41:49,483 --> 01:41:53,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on in music gaming news that isn't so happy.

1398
01:41:53,948 --> 01:41:58,352
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Max Technica 2 and Technica 3 had this online thing called Platinum Crew.

1399
01:41:58,973 --> 01:42:04,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be confused with the Vita version of DJ Max Technica, which I know a lot of you have, but the arcade versions had the Platinum Crew.

1400
01:42:04,759 --> 01:42:06,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that is shutting down.

1401
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:08,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It will no longer be available as of December 1st.

1402
01:42:10,965 --> 01:42:12,387
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1403
01:42:25,962 --> 01:42:26,402
[SPEAKER_02]: SADNESS TO DJ MAXX

1404
01:42:49,481 --> 01:42:50,342
[SPEAKER_02]: All but dead now.

1405
01:42:50,582 --> 01:42:51,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much, unfortunately.

1406
01:43:12,157 --> 01:43:15,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It got pulled due to an intellectual property dispute.

1407
01:43:16,019 --> 01:43:16,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And who closed it?

1408
01:43:17,299 --> 01:43:18,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom.

1409
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Submitted a request on November 19th.

1410
01:43:20,801 --> 01:43:23,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Phantasm was trying to get a developer's license for the game.

1411
01:43:23,903 --> 01:43:26,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have reimagined a lot of the Ghost and Goblin stuff.

1412
01:43:27,344 --> 01:43:31,886
[SPEAKER_02]: If for whatever reason they did not get the rights, they were going to rename it King Arthur.

1413
01:43:32,146 --> 01:43:33,267
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they were just going to call it.

1414
01:43:33,627 --> 01:43:42,631
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it got shut down because I guess Capcom didn't really... It was one of those things where it sounded like they were... Just getting the impression again.

1415
01:43:42,951 --> 01:43:45,872
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to do that after the fact, not before the fact.

1416
01:43:46,252 --> 01:43:49,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And Capcom didn't want the name of the game being used like that.

1417
01:43:49,534 --> 01:43:51,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can kind of see that.

1418
01:43:52,295 --> 01:44:01,859
[SPEAKER_02]: In happier news, our track record for helping out Kickstarters improves this week as read-only memories did get funded.

1419
01:44:01,899 --> 01:44:02,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

1420
01:44:02,959 --> 01:44:05,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to admit, they were really close.

1421
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:08,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really down to the wire, but they did make it.

1422
01:44:08,323 --> 01:44:17,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations to Matt Kahn, who was on the show a couple weeks ago, as well as everybody over at MidBossGames that helps them out because they did reach beyond their goal.

1423
01:44:17,268 --> 01:44:25,333
[SPEAKER_02]: They hit a final tally, 64,378, and they were trying to make 62,000 to get matched by Ouya.

1424
01:44:25,373 --> 01:44:27,615
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good news is now they will be matched by Ouya.

1425
01:44:28,075 --> 01:44:30,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that game is happening.

1426
01:44:30,257 --> 01:44:33,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're hoping that will be playable at GamerX, too.

1427
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:37,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So, congrats to those guys over there at MidBoss Games.

1428
01:44:37,904 --> 01:44:38,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Woot.

1429
01:44:39,125 --> 01:44:39,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally cool.

1430
01:44:39,785 --> 01:44:40,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Look forward to playing.

1431
01:44:41,667 --> 01:44:42,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1432
01:44:42,928 --> 01:44:45,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the screen capture that Bob Coffee just put in chat?

1433
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:46,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not.

1434
01:44:46,331 --> 01:44:47,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yours don't load, do they?

1435
01:44:47,912 --> 01:44:48,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what am I looking at here?

1436
01:44:49,934 --> 01:44:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Wayne Brady from Nintendo.

1437
01:44:51,515 --> 01:44:52,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Wayne Brady.

1438
01:44:52,356 --> 01:44:53,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1439
01:44:54,355 --> 01:44:54,855
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.

1440
01:44:55,075 --> 01:44:55,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1441
01:44:55,715 --> 01:44:57,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a gold shirt wearing you?

1442
01:44:57,136 --> 01:44:57,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

1443
01:44:57,716 --> 01:44:58,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1444
01:44:58,236 --> 01:44:58,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1445
01:44:58,516 --> 01:45:00,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a gold letterbox.

1446
01:45:00,297 --> 01:45:00,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1447
01:45:00,817 --> 01:45:06,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, there is a Fable anniversary set coming out on February 4th, 2014.

1448
01:45:06,438 --> 01:45:11,140
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the 1080p HD version of the original Fable.

1449
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:13,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So, actually, it will be a good game.

1450
01:45:13,701 --> 01:45:16,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will also have launch day weapons and outfits pack.

1451
01:45:16,481 --> 01:45:21,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get a loot weapon that is supposed to be pretty awesome.

1452
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:24,345
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1453
01:45:42,143 --> 01:45:50,028
[SPEAKER_05]: The core version is the 25th anniversary with nine figures, four of Witcher Mega Man, four Robot Masters, and one Dr. Wily.

1454
01:45:50,908 --> 01:45:53,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a $70 packet.

1455
01:45:53,510 --> 01:46:05,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for $140 you get a deluxe version that adds Time Man and Oil Man and 40 card player decks and individual Robot Master game boards and dozens of token pieces.

1456
01:46:06,277 --> 01:46:06,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So good for them.

1457
01:46:08,338 --> 01:46:14,784
[SPEAKER_05]: and another cool thing and this is actually thanks to my hubby who gave me this bit of news while I was trying to work last night.

1458
01:46:16,025 --> 01:46:26,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultra Street Fighter 4 is going to have online training and 3 vs 3 matches like King of Fighters so you can get your Street Fighter 4 on KOF style.

1459
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:37,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I am just looking forward to doing my final fight team of Andorre or Hugo, sorry Poison and

1460
01:46:38,022 --> 01:46:39,303
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1461
01:46:58,857 --> 01:47:01,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when they released Final Fight Guy on the NES.

1462
01:47:01,399 --> 01:47:02,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a big-ass deal.

1463
01:47:02,759 --> 01:47:03,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what I have?

1464
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fight Guy in the box.

1465
01:47:05,481 --> 01:47:07,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, in retro... I'm sorry, not on NES.

1466
01:47:07,482 --> 01:47:08,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Super NES was Final Fight Guy.

1467
01:47:08,863 --> 01:47:10,444
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a Blockbuster exclusive.

1468
01:47:10,984 --> 01:47:14,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um... What's that other... God, fuck.

1469
01:47:14,587 --> 01:47:17,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Mighty Final Fight was the... Mighty Final Fight was the Nintendo one.

1470
01:47:17,548 --> 01:47:18,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of shit.

1471
01:47:18,549 --> 01:47:20,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of shit, you guys.

1472
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:20,730
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

1473
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:22,912
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things everybody's like, yeah, Mighty Final Fight.

1474
01:47:22,932 --> 01:47:23,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they play it, they're like, wow.

1475
01:47:23,932 --> 01:47:24,693
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was fun.

1476
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:26,054
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun for being shit.

1477
01:47:26,314 --> 01:47:26,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1478
01:47:27,034 --> 01:47:36,897
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I'd have to say that Final Fight Guy was always my... I had a copy of it that I had borrowed from someone who stole it from Blockbuster.

1479
01:47:38,658 --> 01:47:39,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I was in Alabama.

1480
01:47:39,718 --> 01:47:40,218
[SPEAKER_05]: We're poor.

1481
01:47:40,298 --> 01:47:40,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Classy.

1482
01:47:41,398 --> 01:47:41,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.

1483
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:47,540
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I gave it back and I moved out here with my friend's Chrono Trigger that he just let me keep.

1484
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:53,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dan and I looked into Final Fight Guy loose and then we looked into the box separately.

1485
01:47:54,602 --> 01:47:56,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we have Final Fight Guy in the box.

1486
01:47:57,303 --> 01:48:03,044
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, let's just cut to the chase and do a Capcom versus SNK 3 already.

1487
01:48:03,064 --> 01:48:03,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yes.

1488
01:48:03,984 --> 01:48:04,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.

1489
01:48:04,984 --> 01:48:05,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Hands in the air.

1490
01:48:06,005 --> 01:48:06,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Testify.

1491
01:48:07,425 --> 01:48:07,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Preach it.

1492
01:48:08,185 --> 01:48:08,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Preach.

1493
01:48:09,325 --> 01:48:09,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Preach.

1494
01:48:10,125 --> 01:48:10,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I tell you?

1495
01:48:10,826 --> 01:48:11,446
[SPEAKER_02]: This needs to happen.

1496
01:48:11,466 --> 01:48:15,486
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, one of the other games that we bought last night was Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

1497
01:48:15,866 --> 01:48:16,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1498
01:48:17,007 --> 01:48:19,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we had to buy one, get one, and we couldn't find another freebie game.

1499
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:20,007
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1500
01:48:20,027 --> 01:48:21,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you had nothing better to do.

1501
01:48:21,127 --> 01:48:22,468
[SPEAKER_05]: We also got Metal Gear Rising.

1502
01:48:22,748 --> 01:48:23,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1503
01:48:23,148 --> 01:48:24,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could play around as pretty boy.

1504
01:48:26,758 --> 01:48:27,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, is that it?

1505
01:48:27,681 --> 01:48:27,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1506
01:48:28,002 --> 01:48:30,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1507
01:48:37,464 --> 01:48:42,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities, we ask a question and you guys answer it.

1508
01:48:42,928 --> 01:48:44,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1509
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:50,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is the holiday season and I'm feeling awfully charitable, I think I'm going to read all the answers tonight, of which there are an awful lot of them.

1510
01:48:50,933 --> 01:48:51,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Rob.

1511
01:48:51,793 --> 01:48:52,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So heads up, guys.

1512
01:48:52,554 --> 01:48:53,274
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it.

1513
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:54,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do it.

1514
01:48:54,515 --> 01:48:54,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheerleader.

1515
01:48:55,115 --> 01:48:55,776
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.

1516
01:48:55,916 --> 01:48:56,456
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only what?

1517
01:48:56,476 --> 01:48:57,617
[SPEAKER_02]: How many answers are on Facebook?

1518
01:48:58,197 --> 01:48:57,617
17.

1519
01:48:58,237 --> 01:48:58,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do this.

1520
01:48:59,018 --> 01:48:59,398
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1521
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:02,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the Fugu question of the week.

1522
01:49:02,691 --> 01:49:06,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh God, this was a moment in history on the internet.

1523
01:49:06,935 --> 01:49:11,419
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet just exploded and the gifts were priceless.

1524
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:22,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm sure you've all heard by now the bombshell that was dropped on the music industry when Beyonce just released a new album with no promotion or fanfare.

1525
01:49:22,248 --> 01:49:25,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole internet went to the Church of Beezus Christ.

1526
01:49:25,811 --> 01:49:27,671
[SPEAKER_02]: and was like, Breach, honey.

1527
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, it's good.

1528
01:49:29,972 --> 01:49:31,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a great album.

1529
01:49:32,092 --> 01:49:44,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, I think my favorite thing that came out of the whole thing is that gif where she just, like Beyonce goes to the table and she just swipes all the albums of like Katy Perry and Gaga and Miley and everything just right off the table.

1530
01:49:44,675 --> 01:49:47,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I will say this quickly, tangent, sorry, apologies, but...

1531
01:49:48,716 --> 01:49:49,537
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1532
01:50:11,636 --> 01:50:12,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

1533
01:50:14,797 --> 01:50:15,477
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so awful.

1534
01:50:15,777 --> 01:50:16,377
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

1535
01:50:16,658 --> 01:50:18,698
[SPEAKER_05]: VH1 had that whole Divas thing for a while, remember?

1536
01:50:18,738 --> 01:50:18,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1537
01:50:19,598 --> 01:50:20,239
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that was cool.

1538
01:50:20,299 --> 01:50:23,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when they would all come together at the end and sing like an Aretha song?

1539
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:29,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And they brought out Carole King at the end, and everyone tried to out-Diva Carole King, and you don't out-Diva Carole King.

1540
01:50:29,922 --> 01:50:30,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1541
01:50:30,722 --> 01:50:31,902
[SPEAKER_05]: On her song.

1542
01:50:32,102 --> 01:50:33,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I understand.

1543
01:50:33,483 --> 01:50:35,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Beyonce just fucking out-Diva'd them all.

1544
01:50:35,983 --> 01:50:38,124
[SPEAKER_02]: She just walked into the room, dropped the mic, and left.

1545
01:50:38,164 --> 01:50:40,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I get it, but, you know.

1546
01:50:40,045 --> 01:50:40,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she's bejesus.

1547
01:50:41,525 --> 01:50:44,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should support all talented artists.

1548
01:50:44,967 --> 01:50:47,449
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also just like that her album is called Beyonce.

1549
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:49,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1550
01:50:50,371 --> 01:50:53,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that aside, Shane is blowing up in chat.

1551
01:50:53,673 --> 01:50:54,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sick of her.

1552
01:50:54,953 --> 01:50:56,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so sick.

1553
01:50:57,215 --> 01:50:58,576
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fucking huge album.

1554
01:50:58,616 --> 01:51:03,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back to check how many... What she did though, what she did was unprecedented.

1555
01:51:03,379 --> 01:51:04,019
[SPEAKER_02]: 400,000 copies sold.

1556
01:51:04,059 --> 01:51:07,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Gaga and Britney combined.

1557
01:51:07,648 --> 01:51:12,810
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like, not just all the music, but she's got videos out for half the stuff on the album.

1558
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:13,210
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.

1559
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:16,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that's on... And they're good videos.

1560
01:51:16,111 --> 01:51:16,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, alright, look.

1561
01:51:16,831 --> 01:51:17,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so anyway.

1562
01:51:17,511 --> 01:51:18,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, sorry.

1563
01:51:18,532 --> 01:51:19,072
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

1564
01:51:19,412 --> 01:51:21,613
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, what the fuck does this have to do with gaming, Rob?

1565
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:23,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't Beyonce sue a video game company?

1566
01:51:23,794 --> 01:51:25,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just like, huh?

1567
01:51:25,594 --> 01:51:27,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, she did, but here's the point.

1568
01:51:27,995 --> 01:51:30,638
[SPEAKER_02]: The gaming community is, this is no stranger to us.

1569
01:51:30,778 --> 01:51:32,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we see this all the time, right?

1570
01:51:32,199 --> 01:51:35,703
[SPEAKER_02]: They come out in E3 and say, hey, if you want to get this today, you can.

1571
01:51:36,363 --> 01:51:36,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what?

1572
01:51:37,264 --> 01:51:38,325
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you?

1573
01:51:38,345 --> 01:51:40,127
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to stop all this woman-on-woman fighting.

1574
01:51:40,167 --> 01:51:41,268
[SPEAKER_05]: We need woman-on-man fighting.

1575
01:51:41,308 --> 01:51:43,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to see Beyonce take out Nickelback for good.

1576
01:51:44,271 --> 01:51:47,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody wants to see Beyonce take out Nickelback for good.

1577
01:51:49,313 --> 01:52:17,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see it like freaking I don't know Celine Dion can take out Nickelback for good for all I care alright anyway so the gaming industry is no surprise this we see these it's out today announcements a lot what if you could in the gaming community have one I said realistic stealth announcement because I didn't want people to be like hologram gaming out today like okay if you could get a realistic stealth announcement this holiday season what bombshell do you want to see drop this holiday season so here we go

1578
01:52:18,525 --> 01:52:47,414
[SPEAKER_02]: um coming up first from Jimmy B who I think honestly he got five likes on this post so I think he kind of has the winning answer here but Jimmy B over on Facebook says Half-Life 3 pops up on Steam on Christmas morning internet explodes we're praying everybody prayer circle let's all form one Half-Life 3 that would be the bombshell I'd like that would melt steam that would melt the internet are you kidding

1579
01:52:48,167 --> 01:53:10,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is ironic, steam melting Alright, Jeremy J, our buddy from Koopa Club Hey Jeremy J, says I'd love to see Game Boy Advance games appear on the Wii U, eShop, OS, all stealth-like Specifically Metroid Zero Mission But yeah, that's a good realistic prediction Nintendo making more money off of old games, absolutely

1580
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:17,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Degenerate Johnny says, I want Rockstar to announce that Grand Theft Auto 5 is out now for the Wii U. It's current gen, so making a port shouldn't be a problem.

1581
01:53:18,028 --> 01:53:24,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, you can use the touchpad screen to help navigate throughout the city as well as play around with the iFruit app while playing GTA 5.

1582
01:53:24,955 --> 01:53:26,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Loki, but I had to speak my mind.

1583
01:53:27,117 --> 01:53:28,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did he have to apologize?

1584
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:31,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be offended by Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Wii U, Loki?

1585
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:32,860
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1586
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:33,380
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1587
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:34,621
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of awesome, actually.

1588
01:53:34,901 --> 01:53:35,301
[SPEAKER_02]: He's right.

1589
01:53:35,341 --> 01:53:37,142
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole integration with the app would be pretty cool.

1590
01:53:37,283 --> 01:53:40,344
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, back to the Beyonce versus Nickelback thing.

1591
01:53:41,104 --> 01:53:44,086
[SPEAKER_05]: While I think Beyonce could take Nickelback, I think Rush could take Beyonce.

1592
01:53:46,047 --> 01:53:47,968
[SPEAKER_05]: All they have to do is have Neil Peart drum on her head.

1593
01:53:50,269 --> 01:53:51,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, moving on.

1594
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:59,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy from PodCulture, Brad, says, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 emulation on the new consoles.

1595
01:53:59,956 --> 01:54:01,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't think that's going to happen, buddy.

1596
01:54:01,397 --> 01:54:01,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1597
01:54:02,939 --> 01:54:07,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the PlayStation 3 would be a lot closer because of the Gaikai technology.

1598
01:54:08,063 --> 01:54:08,903
[SPEAKER_02]: That's possible.

1599
01:54:09,043 --> 01:54:10,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360, I don't know.

1600
01:54:10,464 --> 01:54:14,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Microsoft will do it maybe if they can, but we'll see.

1601
01:54:14,888 --> 01:54:17,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabrice A replies and says, Easy.

1602
01:54:17,370 --> 01:54:18,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega launches a new console.

1603
01:54:19,832 --> 01:54:21,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not stick to the classics?

1604
01:54:22,885 --> 01:54:51,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert K said the rumored to be finished Shenmue HD is released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in time for the in-game Christmas festivities because sailors and I need hope Robert K taking a game of lucky hit on his his gander there so good luck Codeman says I would like Nintendo to announce a new Mario Galaxy I literally went crazy when I played the game for the first time I think a lot of people would like to see a new Mario Galaxy

1605
01:54:52,436 --> 01:54:54,840
[SPEAKER_02]: FifthDream says, is Fallout 4 realistic enough?

1606
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:55,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 15?

1607
01:54:56,642 --> 01:54:57,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

1608
01:54:57,484 --> 01:55:03,112
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be cool if Sony suddenly updated the PlayStation 4 with CD, MP3, and streaming media support.

1609
01:55:03,172 --> 01:55:03,973
[SPEAKER_02]: A firmware update.

1610
01:55:04,013 --> 01:55:05,074
[SPEAKER_02]: That could definitely happen.

1611
01:55:06,403 --> 01:55:10,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Elliot B says, I could ask for a new Metroid Prime or Guitar Room Man, but I'll go with something a little more realistic.

1612
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:12,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Heists in GTA 5 Online.

1613
01:55:13,284 --> 01:55:16,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Launching the online mode without a decent selection of co-op missions was very silly.

1614
01:55:17,305 --> 01:55:19,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the fighter jet death matches are getting stale.

1615
01:55:19,506 --> 01:55:21,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar, throw us a bone already.

1616
01:55:21,566 --> 01:55:22,306
[SPEAKER_02]: You agree with Elliot?

1617
01:55:22,747 --> 01:55:23,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

1618
01:55:23,287 --> 01:55:24,047
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to see some heists?

1619
01:55:24,687 --> 01:55:27,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Heists would be fun, but I don't think it's necessarily getting stale.

1620
01:55:27,848 --> 01:55:34,189
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that they have all these content creator things, it'd be cool to do your own missions or make custom game types and stuff.

1621
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:56,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Sial responds and says Capcom releases a new good Mega Man or a new 2D Metroid from Nintendo Daniel T says the announcement of virtual console cross buy followed by a one more thing announcing the availability of as Jeremy said select Game Boy Advance titles or in my dreams DS and GameCube titles would make me fanboy so hard

1622
01:55:57,997 --> 01:56:08,284
[SPEAKER_02]: John from Critical Myth, our pals over there, Mondays 4 o'clock Pacific on VOG, says Final Fantasy XI free to play on PS Vita 24th December 2013.

1623
01:56:08,324 --> 01:56:10,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Loki would like that very much as well.

1624
01:56:11,506 --> 01:56:16,590
[SPEAKER_02]: BloodDrunk replies and says Steam Holiday Sale Day 1 Half-Life 3 status available now.

1625
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:19,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that response should have been read to like, duh, duh, duh.

1626
01:56:33,892 --> 01:56:35,935
[SPEAKER_05]: or in the Howard Cosell voice.

1627
01:56:36,235 --> 01:56:38,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but don't expect me to do that when I'm sick.

1628
01:56:39,879 --> 01:56:41,682
[SPEAKER_02]: You all know my impressions are not very good.

1629
01:56:43,424 --> 01:56:47,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer L says, I would love the next generation of Pokemon to come out all stealthily.

1630
01:56:47,849 --> 01:56:49,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids around the world would panic.

1631
01:56:50,931 --> 01:57:08,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Pokemon games are capable of coming out without hype But that would be really funny to see happen Ragenator says As totally unrealistic as it may be I'd say that for the Steam Winter Sale Everything is completely and utterly free For a certain period within the sale It's a pipe dream, yeah, but one can dream, right?

1632
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:10,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1633
01:57:24,156 --> 01:57:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly on Facebook, our pal Delvin from Video Game Realness, which is a really fun podcast out of Canada.

1634
01:57:31,741 --> 01:57:38,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Delvin replies and says, Some kind of major Wii U release that none of us saw coming.

1635
01:57:38,585 --> 01:57:40,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Star Fox or Metroid-like.

1636
01:57:40,226 --> 01:57:41,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Something no one is expecting.

1637
01:57:42,767 --> 01:57:44,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Spanish Inquisition the game.

1638
01:57:45,269 --> 01:57:50,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we might have a bit more restored faith in Wii U and say they knew what they were doing all along.

1639
01:57:51,352 --> 01:57:57,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, I think Wii U needs the fanfare to kind of get their investors rallied up a little more, but I'm going to hope.

1640
01:57:57,977 --> 01:58:02,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to form a prayer circle with you because I would love to see that happen on Wii U as well.

1641
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:04,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And shut them haters down.

1642
01:58:04,582 --> 01:58:05,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut them haters down.

1643
01:58:06,643 --> 01:58:08,064
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, a few comments from Google+.

1644
01:58:08,144 --> 01:58:11,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Redertainment says, price drop on everything.

1645
01:58:11,286 --> 01:58:17,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, PS3, 360, games, accessories, everything reduced in price.

1646
01:58:18,011 --> 01:58:19,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'd like a pony.

1647
01:58:21,139 --> 01:58:26,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to reply to something Ranma said about PC will never become the master race for gaming.

1648
01:58:27,506 --> 01:58:29,068
[SPEAKER_05]: All games will be nerfed to console standards.

1649
01:58:29,328 --> 01:58:29,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Not quite so.

1650
01:58:30,089 --> 01:58:32,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's some people that refuse to leave Mac.

1651
01:58:32,371 --> 01:58:32,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget that.

1652
01:58:33,913 --> 01:58:40,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, as far as Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and all that goes, 2014, it'll be a belated Christmas gift for Entertainment Belated.

1653
01:58:41,401 --> 01:59:09,717
[SPEAKER_02]: uh Actdeft says a secret Nintendo Direct this week before we sign off we would like to gladly announce that we're releasing F-Zero Universe a new installment on the beloved F-Zero franchise with HD graphics online play in a new customization mode so you can change your machine however you like when's it going to be released you asked right after this Nintendo Direct is over on the Wii U eShop and a retail version in January how's that for a bombshell announcement well I came

1654
01:59:11,417 --> 01:59:12,878
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I'd like to hear.

1655
01:59:13,778 --> 01:59:14,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1656
01:59:16,299 --> 01:59:16,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1657
01:59:17,659 --> 01:59:20,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I came over to the computer to place my pre-order.

1658
01:59:20,180 --> 01:59:20,780
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I meant.

1659
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing dirty.

1660
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:22,720
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1661
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:24,821
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to call your mom.

1662
01:59:25,081 --> 01:59:26,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam H. Please don't.

1663
01:59:26,561 --> 01:59:29,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam H. says Uncharted 4 available today.

1664
01:59:30,582 --> 01:59:32,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Colin M. says Shenmue 3.

1665
01:59:33,243 --> 01:59:35,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Chalk another Shenmue answer up there.

1666
01:59:35,384 --> 01:59:45,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly but not leastly, Tech2030 replies and says, A new all-hand-drawn 2D Metroid game for Wii U or 3DS would make me the most excited.

1667
01:59:45,409 --> 01:59:45,989
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1668
01:59:46,709 --> 01:59:47,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Love those answers.

1669
01:59:47,510 --> 01:59:49,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys over on Google Plus and Facebook.

1670
01:59:50,011 --> 01:59:51,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Fugo Question of the Week.

1671
01:59:51,072 --> 01:59:51,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I did read them all.

1672
01:59:52,012 --> 01:59:53,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the holiday spirit.

1673
01:59:53,033 --> 01:59:53,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to read them all.

1674
01:59:54,233 --> 01:59:56,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I like hearing people's fanboy dreams.

1675
01:59:56,374 --> 01:59:57,134
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you guys?

1676
01:59:57,215 --> 02:00:00,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you would love to see the stealth announcement comes out?

1677
02:00:03,352 --> 02:00:03,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1678
02:00:03,913 --> 02:00:04,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I was replying to chat room.

1679
02:00:04,854 --> 02:00:05,394
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

1680
02:00:07,537 --> 02:00:07,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1681
02:00:08,558 --> 02:00:12,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really, right now, I don't know.

1682
02:00:13,023 --> 02:00:13,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't know.

1683
02:00:13,764 --> 02:00:16,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I would go with the Half-Life thing.

1684
02:00:17,508 --> 02:00:19,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that would be pretty awesome.

1685
02:00:20,332 --> 02:00:20,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Half-Life!

1686
02:00:20,912 --> 02:00:21,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're done.

1687
02:00:21,333 --> 02:00:21,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1688
02:00:22,867 --> 02:00:49,450
[SPEAKER_02]: the one thing I want more than anything dear Jesus for your birthday I would really like more than anything to see after all these years and all this hoping and all this praying dear Beyonce may I please have the Guardian Legend on virtual console can I get an amen or a true sequel

1689
02:00:51,203 --> 02:00:52,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I will take what I can get.

1690
02:00:52,924 --> 02:00:55,566
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a Guardian Legend variety game.

1691
02:00:55,746 --> 02:00:58,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Compile needs to rise from their grave.

1692
02:00:58,609 --> 02:01:00,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Rise from your grave!

1693
02:01:00,270 --> 02:01:02,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And not do any more Puyo Pop.

1694
02:01:03,253 --> 02:01:06,275
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more Guardian Legend and more Compile shooters.

1695
02:01:08,337 --> 02:01:09,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and Loki?

1696
02:01:10,018 --> 02:01:14,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I'd go for a new DDR.

1697
02:01:15,356 --> 02:01:16,337
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just keeping it simple.

1698
02:01:16,357 --> 02:01:17,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted a new TDR.

1699
02:01:17,619 --> 02:01:18,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that would be shocking.

1700
02:01:18,781 --> 02:01:21,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we're going to do a new TDR.

1701
02:01:21,345 --> 02:01:21,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1702
02:01:21,986 --> 02:01:22,266
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1703
02:01:22,366 --> 02:01:23,768
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only shocking if it's good.

1704
02:01:24,049 --> 02:01:29,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like for our Roosevelt Golf Land to magically have a 2DX machine again and not get rid of it.

1705
02:01:29,978 --> 02:01:32,681
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Scandia is going to get a 2DX machine, probably.

1706
02:01:32,861 --> 02:01:33,041
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1707
02:01:34,122 --> 02:01:37,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you may remember the guy that runs Seanigan.

1708
02:01:37,445 --> 02:01:39,767
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Seanigan, he has this wonderful arcade.

1709
02:01:39,787 --> 02:01:40,588
[SPEAKER_07]: In his garage?

1710
02:01:40,728 --> 02:01:41,228
[SPEAKER_07]: In his garage.

1711
02:01:41,248 --> 02:01:42,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's also at the drive-in, too.

1712
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:45,432
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I ran into, he works at Scandia.

1713
02:01:45,888 --> 02:01:52,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he's picking three of his machines to bring in there, one of which is a 2DX20, I guess, or whatever.

1714
02:01:52,713 --> 02:01:59,899
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually randomly met while I was playing some game over there, one of the shooting games, and we just started talking about his machines.

1715
02:01:59,959 --> 02:02:01,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to get that guy on this show if he's here locally.

1716
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:03,101
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on my Facebook.

1717
02:02:03,261 --> 02:02:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, get him.

1718
02:02:03,862 --> 02:02:04,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Send him a message.

1719
02:02:04,663 --> 02:02:05,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Get him on the show.

1720
02:02:07,164 --> 02:02:07,445
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1721
02:02:08,125 --> 02:02:11,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Shane is sending me a private message in chat because apparently I skipped his answer.

1722
02:02:11,207 --> 02:02:13,268
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's because you answered late, you jerk.

1723
02:02:13,749 --> 02:02:30,019
[SPEAKER_02]: But our buddy Shane from Horde House says, I want a stealth announcement for F-Zero for Wii U and 3DS in the same style as the ACGX versions, and then unlockable GX versions in both the Wii U and 3DS, and Jack Levin's theme making a comeback because it was the best in GX.

1724
02:02:30,339 --> 02:02:32,660
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an awfully tall order, but I would love to see that.

1725
02:02:32,761 --> 02:02:33,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1726
02:02:33,701 --> 02:02:34,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

1727
02:02:34,501 --> 02:02:35,261
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you first.

1728
02:02:35,461 --> 02:02:40,602
[SPEAKER_07]: The current votes for machines that they are going to bring is top three machines will go to the location.

1729
02:02:40,722 --> 02:02:49,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Top three so far, 2DX Linkle, upgraded to Tricoro, PoppyMusic20, upgraded to Sunny Park, and DGMAX Technica 3.

1730
02:02:50,144 --> 02:02:51,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo!

1731
02:02:51,884 --> 02:02:55,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Other is number three, but who knows how Other is.

1732
02:02:56,145 --> 02:02:57,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with all of these selections.

1733
02:02:58,566 --> 02:03:00,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And I forgot what I was going to say, so it doesn't matter.

1734
02:03:00,956 --> 02:03:03,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then let's get back into some news, Loki.

1735
02:03:03,966 --> 02:03:04,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1736
02:03:06,969 --> 02:03:09,431
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Xbox One, let's talk a little bit more about that.

1737
02:03:11,192 --> 02:03:12,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of surprised that they kind of went back.

1738
02:03:13,234 --> 02:03:21,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess it never really worked for retail games, but they're not requiring demos.

1739
02:03:22,462 --> 02:03:26,084
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up to the devs to basically decide whether they're going to put out a demo for their game.

1740
02:03:26,425 --> 02:03:32,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, originally, you had to have a demo for any Xbox Live Arcade game that was out there.

1741
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:38,473
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I guess they're kind of going the route of like the retail games where it doesn't necessarily have to have a demo.

1742
02:03:38,713 --> 02:03:51,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of think that's a little lame because games are expensive and sometimes the demos get you to buy the game or in some cases I guess get you not to buy the game if you can't beat the demo.

1743
02:03:54,199 --> 02:03:57,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it's interesting.

1744
02:03:58,082 --> 02:04:20,096
[SPEAKER_07]: There is one, I guess one of the demos that they're actually putting out, and I really hate, I think Nintendo was the one that kind of started this, but those demos that have a certain number of playthroughs you can do on them before they lock you out of them completely, like Dead Rising 3, they're going to let you play it for 20 minutes, and then you can play it for two more times other than that, and then it's done.

1745
02:04:20,116 --> 02:04:21,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1746
02:04:21,677 --> 02:04:22,458
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.

1747
02:04:22,478 --> 02:04:23,418
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, what the hell, man?

1748
02:04:24,259 --> 02:04:26,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that different from what PlayStation Plus has you do.

1749
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:28,301
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play the first hour, but still.

1750
02:04:28,562 --> 02:04:39,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I remember back when they had the timed demos for Saints Row, and I played that demo over and over and over again, and it just got me hyped about the game, and I bought it immediately when it came out.

1751
02:04:40,009 --> 02:04:44,071
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's how I killed my time until it came out, was by playing that demo over and over and over again.

1752
02:04:45,352 --> 02:04:46,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess just...

1753
02:04:47,293 --> 02:05:06,794
[SPEAKER_07]: um whatever do you have to download the whole stinking thing just to play 20 minutes or does it do like the streaming thing i think it's the i think it's probably a shorter demo it's that's good but it's apparently the map i mean but it's just 20 minutes of it so maybe we have to download the whole thing i don't know um and they've also hit the 2 million sales mark as of um

1754
02:05:08,912 --> 02:05:11,093
[SPEAKER_07]: as of the 11th.

1755
02:05:11,653 --> 02:05:13,454
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hooray.

1756
02:05:15,055 --> 02:05:15,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

1757
02:05:15,415 --> 02:05:15,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

1758
02:05:16,055 --> 02:05:17,576
[SPEAKER_07]: So, everybody's doing well.

1759
02:05:17,736 --> 02:05:18,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Selling lots of consoles.

1760
02:05:19,016 --> 02:05:22,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's spinning it like they're winning, but at the end of the day, they're both doing well.

1761
02:05:22,838 --> 02:05:24,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony and Microsoft, anyway.

1762
02:05:25,179 --> 02:05:25,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the only thing.

1763
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:31,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I'm worried about any of these companies, but I'm seeing a pattern emerge here, and...

1764
02:05:32,822 --> 02:05:34,844
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1765
02:05:53,340 --> 02:06:19,735
[SPEAKER_07]: so it gets me worried that maybe they aren't flying off shelves not to say that they're doing bad I mean they sold 2 million units worldwide so that's not bad but it may be slowing down a lot faster and I think a lot of that has to do probably with the launch lineup there's just not a lot to drive people to buy them so that's my concern I guess it would go with Playstation 2 because maybe they're just not producing a ton of units I think they're about neck and neck as far as sales go

1766
02:06:19,975 --> 02:06:26,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be said as well, even though maybe Nintendo's not having the best luck with Wii U, and it doesn't seem like their fortune's turning around.

1767
02:06:26,098 --> 02:06:30,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're selling more of them, but it's not in the same league as these other consoles right now.

1768
02:06:31,061 --> 02:06:33,422
[SPEAKER_02]: 3DS still continues to sell like wildfires.

1769
02:06:33,482 --> 02:06:36,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a huge success story for Nintendo, so at least there's that.

1770
02:06:37,144 --> 02:06:38,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So they won't be going out of business.

1771
02:06:39,946 --> 02:06:40,226
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1772
02:06:40,886 --> 02:06:43,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, speaking of sales, let's go over to the MPD numbers.

1773
02:06:43,508 --> 02:06:47,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki, you might have to help me out here a little bit because you read into more of the stuff than I do.

1774
02:06:47,871 --> 02:06:49,472
[SPEAKER_02]: But video game sales for the U.S.

1775
02:06:49,512 --> 02:06:55,056
[SPEAKER_02]: in November up 7% from last year, which you would hope is going to happen when you have new consoles out.

1776
02:06:55,456 --> 02:06:58,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardware jumped up 58% again with two new consoles out.

1777
02:06:59,019 --> 02:07:00,260
[SPEAKER_02]: You would hope those numbers go up.

1778
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:07,262
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 4, the top-selling console in November, and PlayStation was number one in sales overall for home consoles.

1779
02:07:08,202 --> 02:07:12,463
[SPEAKER_02]: My fans will be quick to tell you that, well, they had an additional week to sell those consoles.

1780
02:07:12,903 --> 02:07:13,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1781
02:07:13,583 --> 02:07:16,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, they're both doing very well.

1782
02:07:18,125 --> 02:07:20,225
[SPEAKER_02]: 909,132 Xbox One units sold in the U.S.

1783
02:07:20,265 --> 02:07:22,986
[SPEAKER_02]: in the first nine days, meaning over 100,000 a day.

1784
02:07:24,606 --> 02:07:25,967
[SPEAKER_02]: The top-selling games.

1785
02:07:26,027 --> 02:07:26,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the top 10.

1786
02:07:28,737 --> 02:07:29,697
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.

1787
02:07:28,797 --> 02:07:29,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty Ghosts 2.

1788
02:07:30,738 --> 02:07:31,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Battlefield 4 3.

1789
02:07:32,178 --> 02:07:32,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Assassin's Creed 4 4.

1790
02:07:34,278 --> 02:07:35,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Madden 25 5.

1791
02:07:35,879 --> 02:07:36,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto 5 6.

1792
02:07:37,819 --> 02:07:39,319
[SPEAKER_02]: NBA 2K14 7.

1793
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:42,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Skylanders Swap Force 8.

1794
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:43,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Dance 2014 9.

1795
02:07:44,461 --> 02:07:45,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney Infinity 10.

1796
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:48,722
[SPEAKER_02]: FIFA 14 No surprise at all.

1797
02:07:48,762 --> 02:07:54,723
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your typical big sellers, the Call of Duty and the Battlefield, your Assassin's Creed, the Sports Balls,

1798
02:07:55,563 --> 02:08:01,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto is still in there and then the kiddie toy games with Skylanders and Disney Affinity rounding out your top 10.

1799
02:08:01,768 --> 02:08:03,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of surprises in there, right?

1800
02:08:03,909 --> 02:08:04,049
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1801
02:08:04,830 --> 02:08:08,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some of those Nintendo numbers because we do have some numbers about Nintendo.

1802
02:08:08,933 --> 02:08:12,215
[SPEAKER_02]: 770,000 Nintendo 3DSs sold in November.

1803
02:08:12,395 --> 02:08:12,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1804
02:08:16,258 --> 02:08:22,121
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 3DS has been out for a couple years, and they sold almost as many of those as they did Xbox Ones.

1805
02:08:22,542 --> 02:08:23,242
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good.

1806
02:08:25,063 --> 02:08:37,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Wii U hardware sales, they say up by 340%, but I think we all know that's kind of a spin because three times a little number is still not probably going to be a huge number.

1807
02:08:38,090 --> 02:09:06,487
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is what it is but Super Mario 3D World 215,000 digital and physical units in the first 8 days not too shabby especially in light of the article from Japan that didn't have quite the impressive number last week but it should be noted that didn't allow it to crack the top 10 but considering that Super Mario 3D World is on one console and one console that hasn't really cracked through as well as every single one of those games in the top 10 that I read off multiple formats

1808
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:13,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would assume I'm looking right here to set some of the weekly charts for hardware.

1809
02:09:13,823 --> 02:09:16,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to see if I can pull up older stuff.

1810
02:09:16,524 --> 02:09:17,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's not helping.

1811
02:09:18,424 --> 02:09:24,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, for hardware though, like for example, the week of the 7th, that would have been a week ago.

1812
02:09:25,907 --> 02:09:33,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii U moved 72,000 units in North America and the 3DS 244,000.

1813
02:09:33,329 --> 02:09:40,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of give you an idea, you know, when they're saying 700,000, you're probably looking at maybe 150,000 units of Wii U, which is not bad.

1814
02:09:43,792 --> 02:09:44,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad.

1815
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:45,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's good.

1816
02:09:46,153 --> 02:09:51,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's one of those things where it's like, it's not going to bankrupt the company, but it's going to be very interesting to see what they do in 2014.

1817
02:09:52,537 --> 02:09:54,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is Nintendo going to stick with it?

1818
02:09:54,618 --> 02:10:00,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of think they're stubborn enough and they believe in it enough that I think they're going to stick with it.

1819
02:10:01,102 --> 02:10:10,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what they're going to do to sell more, but I think they believe enough in Bayonetta and Smash Brothers and whatever Zelda or Mario game they have hidden up their sleeve for holiday 2014.

1820
02:10:11,305 --> 02:10:13,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart next year is going to be huge.

1821
02:10:13,546 --> 02:10:15,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they believe enough in those that they're going to still try.

1822
02:10:17,699 --> 02:10:27,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it turns it around for them, because if Mario Kart or Smash Brothers can't move units, then they're going to be in trouble.

1823
02:10:27,326 --> 02:10:30,688
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some people saying that Nintendo will announce a new console at this E3.

1824
02:10:31,469 --> 02:10:31,629
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1825
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:33,310
[SPEAKER_07]: That's way too soon.

1826
02:10:33,550 --> 02:10:35,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Internally, are they having that dialogue?

1827
02:10:35,652 --> 02:10:36,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1828
02:10:37,573 --> 02:10:38,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

1829
02:10:38,494 --> 02:10:41,456
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very interesting to see what happens at E3 this year for Nintendo.

1830
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:47,491
[SPEAKER_05]: They seem to be pushing themselves into that outside of the regular release stuff, you know?

1831
02:10:48,331 --> 02:10:48,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1832
02:10:48,671 --> 02:10:52,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's just disappointing not seeing the third-party support just not there.

1833
02:10:52,894 --> 02:10:54,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they're going to be showing stuff on screen.

1834
02:10:55,455 --> 02:11:00,838
[SPEAKER_07]: They're always going to say that they have the third-party support, but they don't have full third-party support, and that's what's really hurting them.

1835
02:11:00,858 --> 02:11:01,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, 3DS does.

1836
02:11:02,879 --> 02:11:03,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily.

1837
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:06,641
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no EA 3DS games anymore.

1838
02:11:06,781 --> 02:11:07,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

1839
02:11:07,322 --> 02:11:07,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1840
02:11:08,174 --> 02:11:09,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they've completely cut them off.

1841
02:11:09,555 --> 02:11:12,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, they have plenty of stuff on 3DS keeping it going, you know?

1842
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:15,861
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of stuff on 3DS.

1843
02:11:16,482 --> 02:11:20,366
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when they speak about Nintendo partners and not just 3DS and Wii U separately, you know what I mean?

1844
02:11:20,566 --> 02:11:25,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because EA's not supporting them on any of the platforms right now.

1845
02:11:26,285 --> 02:11:30,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Zebediah the Messiah in our chatroom says Mario Kart Wii U bundle and I'm in.

1846
02:11:31,627 --> 02:11:33,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a guaranteed from Nintendo.

1847
02:11:33,648 --> 02:11:36,449
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, you know Costco and Best Buy and all that.

1848
02:11:36,469 --> 02:11:37,529
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have their bundles.

1849
02:11:37,709 --> 02:11:38,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1850
02:11:39,110 --> 02:11:45,932
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR says Smash Brothers usually sells consoles, but I think the biggest threat to Smash selling Wii U consoles is Smash for 3DS.

1851
02:11:47,272 --> 02:11:54,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the other thing too is a lot of people already bought the Wii U for Smash Brothers, so you can't really count a lot of new sales from that.

1852
02:11:54,635 --> 02:11:54,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Who

1853
02:11:54,815 --> 02:11:57,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Who buys a console for a game two years out from now?

1854
02:11:59,728 --> 02:12:00,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1855
02:12:00,751 --> 02:12:01,733
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of considered.

1856
02:12:02,375 --> 02:12:03,478
[SPEAKER_02]: You considered, but you didn't?

1857
02:12:03,578 --> 02:12:03,718
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1858
02:12:05,316 --> 02:12:34,069
[SPEAKER_02]: so you know anyway I would say if you're gonna get a Wii U get a fucking Wii U because the Mario 3D World is one of the best games you're gonna play this year period especially if you have people in your house to play games with or people over frequently you will not find a better party multiplayer game experience than you will with Mario 3D World that's what you're missing but you know again do you want to pay three what would that be about $300 system plus game just wait the price will come down do you want to pay $300 to be the coolest kid on the block

1859
02:12:36,932 --> 02:12:38,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1860
02:12:38,693 --> 02:12:39,473
[SPEAKER_02]: More news.

1861
02:12:39,593 --> 02:12:40,113
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1862
02:12:40,874 --> 02:12:43,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do have another bit of news.

1863
02:12:43,315 --> 02:12:48,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And this actually came to me by means of one of my friends who I met through Tumblr.

1864
02:12:49,757 --> 02:12:51,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to give you the story of how I met her later.

1865
02:12:52,398 --> 02:12:53,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was very interesting.

1866
02:12:53,719 --> 02:12:54,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Trading porn pics?

1867
02:12:54,939 --> 02:12:55,119
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1868
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:55,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1869
02:12:57,641 --> 02:12:58,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Tumblr.

1870
02:12:58,602 --> 02:12:59,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just here for the gifts.

1871
02:12:59,524 --> 02:13:04,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at the Russian market and saw one of their free publications with someone's Homestuck fan art on it on the cover.

1872
02:13:05,230 --> 02:13:07,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And the article that it was advertising had nothing to do with Homestuck.

1873
02:13:08,533 --> 02:13:12,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So I found out who did it, messaged her, and mailed her the magazine in Australia.

1874
02:13:13,479 --> 02:13:14,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's something.

1875
02:13:15,036 --> 02:13:17,819
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been chatting off and on back.

1876
02:13:18,139 --> 02:13:18,940
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a really good artist.

1877
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,742
[SPEAKER_05]: She's done a thank you pic for me.

1878
02:13:20,762 --> 02:13:22,163
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a really, really good artist.

1879
02:13:22,664 --> 02:13:37,078
[SPEAKER_05]: But she linked me this story about how the South Australian government is doing an anti-gaming campaign that has a little girl with shades on at a poker table looking at her iPad saying, gambling starts with games.

1880
02:13:39,040 --> 02:14:01,293
[SPEAKER_05]: and basically what they're trying to do is I think it has more to do with the Facebook style and casual games, the online poker and the microtransaction type games but they have a site that's called nogame.sa.gov.au which I hate giving it anything but go look at it and laugh.

1881
02:14:02,574 --> 02:14:24,794
[SPEAKER_05]: so basically it's supposed to say it's wanting to add an MA 15 plus to any game that includes simulated gambling meaning slot machines a card mechanics even what was the last Pokemon games Diamond and Pearl had like a slot machine thing in them didn't they I don't remember

1882
02:14:25,248 --> 02:14:31,652
[SPEAKER_05]: or, you know, any game that has some kind of variety of anything that could be, you know, construed as gambling.

1883
02:14:32,113 --> 02:14:36,696
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're trying to get this bit of a... Is Pachinko considered gambling?

1884
02:14:36,836 --> 02:14:38,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Nintendo Land has the Pachinko in it.

1885
02:14:39,077 --> 02:14:39,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally gambling.

1886
02:14:40,018 --> 02:14:42,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, Pachinko technically is gambling.

1887
02:14:42,559 --> 02:14:45,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... Final Fantasy X-2 has, like, Casino Land.

1888
02:14:45,401 --> 02:14:46,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1889
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:53,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, look at Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Casino Night Zone Which was like the best zone in the whole game I know, right?

1890
02:14:54,767 --> 02:14:59,752
[SPEAKER_02]: MM2K in chat at live.vognetwork.com says Australian government hates games It sure seems that way

1891
02:15:00,256 --> 02:15:19,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Ron Curry, who is the CEO of Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, has gone out saying that the view is supported by the fact that there was no consultation with an industry lead in the lead up to this policy announcement and the subsequent awareness campaign, meaning that they haven't even reached out to work with the companies.

1892
02:15:19,895 --> 02:15:22,157
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going on a broad generalization.

1893
02:15:23,398 --> 02:15:28,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the way that this was linked to me is, have you seen this fuckery?

1894
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:33,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's not exactly what, you know, how she said it, but it was pretty much the same thing.

1895
02:15:34,001 --> 02:15:43,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was going on to explain how there's a lot of revenue in South Australia comes from slot machines.

1896
02:15:43,204 --> 02:15:49,466
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big problem with gambling because, and I believe they're called pokies there.

1897
02:15:49,806 --> 02:15:51,147
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're blaming games for that?

1898
02:15:51,667 --> 02:16:01,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, out of curiosity, I wanted to know, because you know, right here in the States right now, everybody's talking about mega millions, because the lottery is up to like $500 million, and even I'm buying a lotto ticket, that says something.

1899
02:16:01,574 --> 02:16:04,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually don't pay the idiot tax, as my mom calls it.

1900
02:16:04,596 --> 02:16:06,598
[SPEAKER_02]: You gonna pay the idiot tax, Rob?

1901
02:16:07,278 --> 02:16:09,380
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you buy the lottery tickets, you're an idiot.

1902
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:10,561
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway.

1903
02:16:10,721 --> 02:16:11,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she wouldn't be saying that if you won.

1904
02:16:11,922 --> 02:16:12,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1905
02:16:12,522 --> 02:16:16,245
[SPEAKER_02]: When I win, and we see what home she gets put in, we'll see.

1906
02:16:16,345 --> 02:16:17,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Let her retire in Boca.

1907
02:16:18,466 --> 02:16:22,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as she also says, it costs a dollar to dream these days, doesn't it, Rab?

1908
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:27,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the reason why I bring that up is I was curious, does Australia have the lottery?

1909
02:16:27,794 --> 02:16:29,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know much about the culture there.

1910
02:16:29,416 --> 02:16:30,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Australia have lottery?

1911
02:16:30,356 --> 02:16:31,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some chatters can set me straight.

1912
02:16:31,798 --> 02:16:37,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we have any Aussies in chat tonight, but I'm looking at Wikipedia, which I always love to go to to look up information.

1913
02:16:37,422 --> 02:16:40,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like there's some different types of Australian lotteries, kind of depending about where you are.

1914
02:16:40,945 --> 02:16:41,145
[SPEAKER_02]: There's

1915
02:16:41,846 --> 02:16:46,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Tats has a lottery in Victoria, Tasmania, and the Australian Capital Territory in the Northern Territory.

1916
02:16:46,692 --> 02:16:49,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some state-owned, including the South Australian lotteries.

1917
02:16:50,056 --> 02:16:53,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason why I bring that up is like, well, okay, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.

1918
02:16:54,021 --> 02:17:01,089
[SPEAKER_02]: The government has a sanctioned lottery system, yet we're going to pinpoint video games as don't play games because it'll lead to gambling.

1919
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:01,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Like,

1920
02:17:03,308 --> 02:17:04,889
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1921
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:24,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1922
02:17:46,094 --> 02:17:54,284
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's caused, you know, there have been political parties formed to, you know, to get rid of the legalized gambling.

1923
02:17:55,265 --> 02:18:01,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if people are having such a big problem with it to the point that they're trying to censor games to...

1924
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,281
[SPEAKER_05]: to prevent that.

1925
02:18:04,621 --> 02:18:13,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't they just pass the legislation and get rid of the machines or else regulate them a lot harder than they are now.

1926
02:18:14,066 --> 02:18:15,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the other side of that.

1927
02:18:16,227 --> 02:18:17,688
[SPEAKER_05]: They get a lot of money from those machines.

1928
02:18:18,168 --> 02:18:20,469
[SPEAKER_05]: They get a lot of money from those machines.

1929
02:18:20,549 --> 02:18:30,134
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like in Mississippi after Katrina because they didn't want the casinos on Mississippi soil so they were on barges.

1930
02:18:31,395 --> 02:18:47,169
[SPEAKER_05]: and then right after Katrina hit and the casinos were like we're going to leave because we're not going to build them on barges for the next hurricane to knock us over Mississippi changed their laws really quickly so that they could keep that source of revenue and keep all those jobs in Biloxi

1931
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:59,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it's, it's obviously if you know somebody that's addicted to gambling, you know, that's a real thing, but there's lots of, you can get addicted to anything, you know, you can get addicted to video games and that's dangerous too, you know, but I just don't.

1932
02:18:59,992 --> 02:19:01,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's excessive compulsive behavior.

1933
02:19:01,173 --> 02:19:01,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1934
02:19:02,514 --> 02:19:04,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you're gonna, I like gambling.

1935
02:19:04,395 --> 02:19:05,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Did video games cause that?

1936
02:19:05,716 --> 02:19:06,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

1937
02:19:06,957 --> 02:19:22,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate gambling I also put a limit on my gambling like if I go to Reno or something I usually say okay $100 in fun money that's how much I would spend on a concert ticket to go see a AAA concert or you know a night out with drinks for Alan and I you know see

1938
02:19:23,115 --> 02:19:25,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Your limit is about 10 times more than my limit.

1939
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:37,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the only times I have ever gone gambling with a purpose is when I had 50 cents and needed cab money and made myself $15.

1940
02:19:38,274 --> 02:19:40,535
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR in chat says, Gambling video games might cause gambling.

1941
02:19:40,555 --> 02:19:40,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but...

1942
02:20:03,310 --> 02:20:03,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1943
02:20:04,331 --> 02:20:09,552
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird for me to say that, oh, because they played it in the game, they got addicted to gambling.

1944
02:20:09,592 --> 02:20:15,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they were wired for that anyway, wouldn't just playing gambling kind of get them into that?

1945
02:20:16,634 --> 02:20:29,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to do with... I kind of have a problem with calling certain behaviors an addiction, except they do give that same sort of chemical response.

1946
02:20:31,935 --> 02:20:36,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that case, you're creating your own drug by performing the action.

1947
02:20:37,139 --> 02:20:45,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it comes, the only way to break that is to either remove the ability to do the action or remove the positive sensation that comes from the action.

1948
02:20:45,884 --> 02:21:01,655
[SPEAKER_05]: But even with losing money, losing friends, suffering financial difficulties because of the reward, the behavior, it doesn't stop that feeling of pleasure that somebody gets from participating in it.

1949
02:21:02,035 --> 02:21:03,936
[SPEAKER_05]: which is why you have people that are addicted to gambling.

1950
02:21:03,976 --> 02:21:05,517
[SPEAKER_05]: You have people that are addicted to gaming.

1951
02:21:05,958 --> 02:21:09,760
[SPEAKER_05]: You have people who are pathological house cleaners.

1952
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:14,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the same kind of pleasure response that comes from continued action.

1953
02:21:14,063 --> 02:21:14,683
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my mother.

1954
02:21:14,883 --> 02:21:17,345
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother will follow you in the house with a vacuum cleaner.

1955
02:21:17,645 --> 02:21:18,086
[SPEAKER_02]: She will.

1956
02:21:18,306 --> 02:21:18,746
[SPEAKER_02]: No joke.

1957
02:21:19,246 --> 02:21:20,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I have literally caught her doing this.

1958
02:21:20,507 --> 02:21:29,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a cup of coffee and I sat it on her counter or whatever and I was talking and talking and then I picked it up and put the cup away in the sink and she came in right behind me and wiped down the counter.

1959
02:21:31,633 --> 02:22:00,187
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's I'm trying to there's and for a lot of people you know I'm trying to get back to what I was trying to say with this too is that instead of treating the enabler being the gambling or the gateway as they're calling it the games that have the gambling element they need to treat the the behavior addiction

1960
02:22:02,130 --> 02:22:07,654
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't penalize a whole group for something that's a problem of a handful of people.

1961
02:22:08,274 --> 02:22:12,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you or someone you know got addicted to gambling and video games are to blame for it, we'd love to hear from you.

1962
02:22:12,838 --> 02:22:17,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Meanwhile, back into the news, Loki.

1963
02:22:17,921 --> 02:22:21,103
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like one of those advertisements for like Ricky Lake.

1964
02:22:21,343 --> 02:22:27,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Call 1-877-GO-RICKY Did your drag queen dad beat you when you were a child?

1965
02:22:27,648 --> 02:22:28,949
[SPEAKER_07]: If so, call us now.

1966
02:22:29,622 --> 02:22:31,042
[SPEAKER_05]: That show is such a fucking train wreck.

1967
02:22:31,623 --> 02:22:33,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.

1968
02:22:33,663 --> 02:22:36,264
[SPEAKER_02]: She'd be like, oh my god, I'm not getting into this.

1969
02:22:36,284 --> 02:22:37,925
[SPEAKER_02]: She'd just stand back and watch like, oh my god.

1970
02:22:37,985 --> 02:22:43,606
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always that look of her hand pressed against her face and her jaw dropped like, I can't control what's going on.

1971
02:22:43,826 --> 02:22:47,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Ricky, go back to doing Waters movies.

1972
02:22:47,047 --> 02:22:50,889
[SPEAKER_02]: The legit best weave pulling of all time came from the Ricky Lake show too.

1973
02:22:50,929 --> 02:22:51,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Google it.

1974
02:22:51,749 --> 02:22:53,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Ricky Lake weave pulling.

1975
02:22:53,209 --> 02:22:54,470
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fascinating.

1976
02:22:54,510 --> 02:22:54,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1977
02:22:55,450 --> 02:23:04,821
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt says Australian PSA, don't gamble or a dingo will eat your baby I'm sure the Australians that listen to this show greatly appreciate that SSJ100 Matt

1978
02:23:05,569 --> 02:23:06,489
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you expect?

1979
02:23:06,569 --> 02:23:12,951
[SPEAKER_07]: When a game service doesn't exactly work like it's supposed to, what are you to do?

1980
02:23:13,091 --> 02:23:17,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you should go on the internet and complain.

1981
02:23:17,952 --> 02:23:22,054
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, the lawyers come and decide, hey, let's make this into a class action lawsuit.

1982
02:23:22,194 --> 02:23:28,035
[SPEAKER_07]: In which case, that's what's happening now with a law firm investigating EA and Battlefield 4.

1983
02:23:30,196 --> 02:23:34,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Law firm Holzer Holzer and Holzer Holzer and Fistel.

1984
02:23:35,197 --> 02:23:37,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that name, that's awesome.

1985
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:53,588
[SPEAKER_07]: LLC is investigating whether EA, I guess they claim that regarding the development and sales of Battlefield 4 and its impact on EA's revenue and projects moving forward, complied with federal security laws.

1986
02:23:53,868 --> 02:23:55,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what the hell that means.

1987
02:23:55,149 --> 02:24:00,993
[SPEAKER_07]: All I know is people are bitching about Battlefield 4 and that I'm guessing that they're smelling money somewhere.

1988
02:24:01,053 --> 02:24:01,213
[SPEAKER_07]: That

1989
02:24:01,553 --> 02:24:10,220
[SPEAKER_07]: hmm that whole SimCity thing was really fucked up and people were really pissed by that hmm maybe we can get some of the money out of that EA's got money right?

1990
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:12,282
[SPEAKER_07]: EA's got a bit of money I think

1991
02:24:13,319 --> 02:24:14,660
[SPEAKER_02]: because they charge us for everything.

1992
02:24:16,021 --> 02:24:22,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking, though, that this may not necessarily be... If the internet wins this class action lawsuit, we lose.

1993
02:24:22,945 --> 02:24:23,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

1994
02:24:24,046 --> 02:24:26,568
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not necessarily for people that are playing the game.

1995
02:24:26,628 --> 02:24:36,134
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for investors basically saying that they misled investors that they knew that Battlefield 4 was going to be a fucked up thing and that they knew that they were going to lose money and stuff.

1996
02:24:36,254 --> 02:24:36,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Clever.

1997
02:24:36,834 --> 02:24:39,416
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's all about.

1998
02:24:39,896 --> 02:24:41,678
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, seriously, it's...

1999
02:24:42,558 --> 02:24:42,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Money.

2000
02:24:43,220 --> 02:24:44,785
[SPEAKER_07]: They smell money, they're gonna go for the money.

2001
02:24:45,648 --> 02:24:46,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like blood and sharks.

2002
02:24:47,874 --> 02:24:48,356
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you gonna do?

2003
02:24:50,519 --> 02:24:52,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Shark is delicious, but you can't eat people.

2004
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:57,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, I know I would eat this game right up if it comes out.

2005
02:24:58,581 --> 02:25:00,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't love the Second Densetsu series?

2006
02:25:01,201 --> 02:25:05,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't know it by that name, perhaps if I said Secret of Mana, remember that game?

2007
02:25:05,182 --> 02:25:07,062
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a classic, classic Super Nintendo game.

2008
02:25:07,082 --> 02:25:08,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is sad, because Legend of Mana was kind of crap.

2009
02:25:09,063 --> 02:25:13,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Mana was pretty balls, but Second Densetsu 3, really good.

2010
02:25:13,184 --> 02:25:14,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardcore awesome.

2011
02:25:15,404 --> 02:25:22,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret of Evermore, Underrated, I realized it wasn't really part of the same series because it was Square America's game, but Underrated, I think.

2012
02:25:23,269 --> 02:25:25,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Time was really mean to that game.

2013
02:25:27,032 --> 02:25:31,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the Of Mana series, I think a lot of us would love to play a new game in that again.

2014
02:25:31,875 --> 02:25:43,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are hints that an unannounced title in the series could be brewing, and this is because of a Christmas album that featured a song from an as-of-yet-unreleased game.

2015
02:25:43,962 --> 02:25:52,025
[SPEAKER_02]: The official page for Xmas Collections 2 includes a mention of Second Detsetsu, the series' Japanese name, labeled as Future Project.

2016
02:25:52,745 --> 02:25:55,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, could this be Circle of Mana?

2017
02:25:55,406 --> 02:26:00,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Circle of Mana was a Japanese release on iOS and Android devices, which I'm...

2018
02:26:00,908 --> 02:26:03,429
[SPEAKER_02]: which is very strange that we don't have that here yet.

2019
02:26:03,569 --> 02:26:07,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of time before that's translated and comes out over here.

2020
02:26:07,731 --> 02:26:10,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie instantly picked up her phone and started searching.

2021
02:26:10,113 --> 02:26:11,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Only in Japan, Jamie.

2022
02:26:11,593 --> 02:26:12,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Only in Japan.

2023
02:26:12,834 --> 02:26:14,135
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look and bookmark it.

2024
02:26:14,455 --> 02:26:16,136
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why you jailbreak your devices.

2025
02:26:17,076 --> 02:26:17,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

2026
02:26:17,857 --> 02:26:22,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyhow, I know I would love to see a new of Mana game.

2027
02:26:22,679 --> 02:26:27,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hope that is something that's in the pipeline for oh, wouldn't that be an awesome PlayStation 4 game?

2028
02:26:29,042 --> 02:26:29,423
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki?

2029
02:26:38,643 --> 02:26:39,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there could be any truth here?

2030
02:26:39,804 --> 02:26:40,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's just circle of mana?

2031
02:26:41,145 --> 02:26:41,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I need new pants.

2032
02:26:44,167 --> 02:26:44,427
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2033
02:26:45,688 --> 02:26:47,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to the mailbag.

2034
02:26:47,230 --> 02:26:51,413
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, unfortunately, will have to put her phone down to find the game that she's not going to be able to find.

2035
02:26:52,233 --> 02:26:54,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to go to the mailbag.

2036
02:26:58,358 --> 02:26:58,719
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2037
02:26:58,859 --> 02:27:03,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week, you guys email us mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

2038
02:27:03,442 --> 02:27:07,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag head first and find an email that she thinks, hey.

2039
02:27:08,151 --> 02:27:08,971
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's twitching.

2040
02:27:09,172 --> 02:27:15,695
[SPEAKER_02]: This one should be read on air because if I don't read it, we'll get another email next week chewing me out.

2041
02:27:16,755 --> 02:27:17,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a couple emails this week, right?

2042
02:27:19,296 --> 02:27:19,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one or two, right?

2043
02:27:21,397 --> 02:27:21,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Three.

2044
02:27:22,078 --> 02:27:22,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, three, okay.

2045
02:27:22,898 --> 02:27:23,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me get this straight.

2046
02:27:23,859 --> 02:27:27,721
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys do a video game podcast, but you couldn't be bothered to actually watch a video game's award show.

2047
02:27:28,121 --> 02:27:32,563
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you were able to do a little Monday morning quarterbacking and bash the show none of you watched.

2048
02:27:32,643 --> 02:27:33,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I didn't bash anything.

2049
02:27:34,844 --> 02:27:39,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched the live stream and it was better than the usual schtick you see in award shows.

2050
02:27:39,087 --> 02:27:47,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of making a big deal about the subjective superlatives of best this and that, the show is bringing gamers the previews of upcoming games, something all gamers are normally excited to see.

2051
02:27:48,194 --> 02:27:49,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And bashing Joel is just mean.

2052
02:27:49,635 --> 02:27:51,456
[SPEAKER_05]: He was hired to do a job and I thought he earned his pay.

2053
02:27:51,496 --> 02:27:57,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Calling him transphobic was unfairly judgmental considering you didn't watch the show and everything you heard about it was taken out of context.

2054
02:27:58,021 --> 02:28:00,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, you do have a right to your opinion, but next time do your homework.

2055
02:28:01,284 --> 02:28:02,505
[SPEAKER_05]: You do a video game podcast.

2056
02:28:02,525 --> 02:28:05,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems a little odd and disappointing that not one of you took the time to watch the show.

2057
02:28:05,288 --> 02:28:05,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, wow.

2058
02:28:05,828 --> 02:28:06,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely, Narc.

2059
02:28:07,470 --> 02:28:11,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember saying anything about the guy because I didn't watch it and I didn't have anything to say.

2060
02:28:12,691 --> 02:28:17,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't watch it, and I was recanting things that I read across the internet.

2061
02:28:17,933 --> 02:28:23,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that people were offended at some of the things that Joel McHale said, whether you weren't or not, other people were.

2062
02:28:23,596 --> 02:28:27,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I thought I was defending him, but that was me.

2063
02:28:27,617 --> 02:28:38,242
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, this guy's welcome to his opinion, but I kind of have a problem with the... He says, because you guys have a video game podcast, you should watch this show.

2064
02:28:38,942 --> 02:28:39,142
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2065
02:28:40,483 --> 02:28:40,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

2066
02:28:41,494 --> 02:28:44,676
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's something I don't care about watching, I don't have to watch anything.

2067
02:28:45,456 --> 02:28:50,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I listen to other independent podcasts that do their award shows, and I'm curious what they have to say.

2068
02:28:50,439 --> 02:28:54,962
[SPEAKER_02]: People like you and me that do their own shows, and I read websites.

2069
02:28:55,803 --> 02:29:00,486
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes this any more or less of a deal than those?

2070
02:29:01,690 --> 02:29:03,491
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not proven to me in the email.

2071
02:29:03,532 --> 02:29:06,654
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I heard in there was, oh, they have previews of new games.

2072
02:29:07,234 --> 02:29:07,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

2073
02:29:07,815 --> 02:29:09,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I did look at all of those on YouTube after.

2074
02:29:10,677 --> 02:29:14,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And if Joel was so great, why did they excise him completely from the TV version?

2075
02:29:16,822 --> 02:29:18,664
[SPEAKER_07]: And I watched part of the show.

2076
02:29:18,684 --> 02:29:28,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't watch the whole thing because I had things to do that day, but I did catch part of it and I commented on the part I saw as well as the recaps I saw on YouTube, which I know were cleverly edited together.

2077
02:29:29,324 --> 02:29:34,887
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was going to be perfectly honest about it, I've been so busy with school and other stuff, I actually didn't even know it was on.

2078
02:29:35,567 --> 02:29:43,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like I said, I have my feelings about what I've heard from that, but I don't care either way.

2079
02:29:44,052 --> 02:29:47,734
[SPEAKER_02]: If you play a musical instrument, are you required to watch the Grammys?

2080
02:29:48,134 --> 02:29:48,434
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2081
02:29:48,674 --> 02:29:51,696
[SPEAKER_02]: If you make home movies, are you required to watch the Oscars?

2082
02:29:51,716 --> 02:29:51,756
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2083
02:29:54,299 --> 02:29:56,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of throwing it out there.

2084
02:29:57,221 --> 02:30:05,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm challenging because obviously this guy puts VGX up on a pedestal, which is fine.

2085
02:30:05,065 --> 02:30:05,985
[SPEAKER_02]: You're allowed to do that.

2086
02:30:06,105 --> 02:30:09,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we were too harsh on things.

2087
02:30:09,767 --> 02:30:15,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think his criticism is that we're criticizing the show, yet we didn't watch the entire show.

2088
02:30:15,850 --> 02:30:19,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, if I had to watch that entire show, I'd be tearing my hair out.

2089
02:30:19,672 --> 02:30:20,793
[SPEAKER_07]: It was slow.

2090
02:30:21,073 --> 02:30:23,034
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very slow paced.

2091
02:30:23,734 --> 02:30:24,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to do that.

2092
02:30:24,954 --> 02:30:26,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to explain two things last week.

2093
02:30:26,895 --> 02:30:32,718
[SPEAKER_02]: One, what I heard everybody else saying because, yeah, of course I'm going to say, oh, this is the feeling I was getting.

2094
02:30:33,218 --> 02:30:41,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I read this person's blog that was very upset over the joke that Joel McHale said because this was a transgender person themselves that was very upset at the joke.

2095
02:30:41,841 --> 02:30:45,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I was going to communicate that I heard some people were pretty pissed off at this joke.

2096
02:30:46,503 --> 02:30:46,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

2097
02:30:49,945 --> 02:30:54,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you why I don't watch it because I don't see the reason to.

2098
02:30:55,369 --> 02:31:03,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not like I can sit here on a video game show and just flat out say, which is the honest truth, that I didn't care about the fact that there was an award show.

2099
02:31:03,575 --> 02:31:05,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't care who won and I didn't care about watching it.

2100
02:31:06,677 --> 02:31:07,618
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make good radio.

2101
02:31:09,370 --> 02:31:21,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I love video games You, the emailer, love video games The chatters that are here love video games DarkSakura and Loki love video games That is why we do a video game podcast End For the record, I really didn't care

2102
02:31:22,102 --> 02:31:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I don't want to sound combative or anything, although this email was pretty pointed, because everybody does have a right to their opinion, and I can get where you're kind of like, well, don't shut your yap if you're going to comment on something you didn't even watch.

2103
02:31:34,985 --> 02:31:38,086
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's what's going on out there.

2104
02:31:38,146 --> 02:31:39,506
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to comment on it somehow.

2105
02:31:39,806 --> 02:31:45,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a big human nature kind of thing, at least amongst the average neurotypical human being.

2106
02:31:45,848 --> 02:31:49,549
[SPEAKER_05]: No one likes to hear when someone does not like something that they like.

2107
02:31:50,069 --> 02:31:50,769
[SPEAKER_02]: A very good point.

2108
02:31:51,317 --> 02:32:00,605
[SPEAKER_05]: however, it must be understood that sometimes you may like something and other people either will not like it or don't give a shit about it you have to live with that

2109
02:32:01,664 --> 02:32:11,133
[SPEAKER_02]: You wrote that article on VOG this week all about Homestuck, which is something... Well, but to be fair, that's something plenty of people have judged without really looking at it themselves.

2110
02:32:11,354 --> 02:32:12,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be accurate to say?

2111
02:32:12,555 --> 02:32:13,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say so, yeah.

2112
02:32:13,316 --> 02:32:19,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be plenty because some of the cosplayers have been boneheads, and you touched on that in the article.

2113
02:32:20,343 --> 02:32:24,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, sometimes it's people giving it a bad image and so forth, so...

2114
02:32:24,947 --> 02:32:37,312
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was looking for graphics, because I wanted a good background to do the banner from, I actually found a write-up by a mother who had just thought it was the crap.

2115
02:32:37,732 --> 02:32:39,213
[SPEAKER_05]: She wasn't interested in it.

2116
02:32:39,273 --> 02:32:40,573
[SPEAKER_05]: She thought it was corrupting her kids.

2117
02:32:40,974 --> 02:32:46,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And then actually took the time to sit and go through the entire thing and ended up loving the story.

2118
02:32:46,816 --> 02:32:48,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a mom probably in her 50s.

2119
02:32:49,617 --> 02:32:50,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Ended up really liking it.

2120
02:32:50,999 --> 02:32:54,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, already a sci-fi fan found things that she could relate to in it.

2121
02:32:55,745 --> 02:33:01,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, you know, maybe if I had sat down and watched it, then maybe I would have liked it.

2122
02:33:01,393 --> 02:33:04,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't care enough.

2123
02:33:04,838 --> 02:33:05,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't bash it.

2124
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:07,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I bashed it, did I?

2125
02:33:08,267 --> 02:33:08,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2126
02:33:09,068 --> 02:33:11,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris109 in our chatroom says, Video games rule.

2127
02:33:12,290 --> 02:33:13,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, dude.

2128
02:33:13,070 --> 02:33:13,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games rule.

2129
02:33:14,291 --> 02:33:15,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And Chris109 says, Opinions.

2130
02:33:16,172 --> 02:33:19,134
[SPEAKER_02]: They are awesome, yet cause issues because people misunderstand it.

2131
02:33:19,695 --> 02:33:20,075
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2132
02:33:20,375 --> 02:33:26,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say thank you for the email, and I think if people think we need to be called out on something, then do it.

2133
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:29,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Tone is going to be very important in that.

2134
02:33:29,841 --> 02:33:34,304
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get an email that says, Fuck you, you fucking fuck, then we're probably not going to respond to that in kind.

2135
02:33:34,384 --> 02:33:35,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's probably one of my emails.

2136
02:33:36,126 --> 02:33:36,526
Yeah.

2137
02:33:37,066 --> 02:33:39,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But, well, it goes back to that Facebook comment from a couple weeks ago.

2138
02:33:39,948 --> 02:33:45,331
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as long as you do it respectfully, we'll give you, you know, we'll have a respectful dialogue.

2139
02:33:45,511 --> 02:33:47,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of the day, have a beer and play some games.

2140
02:33:48,232 --> 02:33:51,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that the email was disrespectful.

2141
02:33:52,111 --> 02:33:52,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't either.

2142
02:33:52,891 --> 02:33:58,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit pointed, but I understand why there's anger.

2143
02:33:58,793 --> 02:34:10,035
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also think that at the same time, just because, and this is something I kind of wished I'd put in my article too, and I do understand that if you're not going to watch something, it doesn't put you in a position to bash it.

2144
02:34:10,115 --> 02:34:18,637
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it doesn't mean that you can't take a community-wide opinion and report on it, which is what we did.

2145
02:34:21,463 --> 02:34:22,004
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

2146
02:34:41,426 --> 02:34:52,203
[SPEAKER_02]: well okay let's be real though yes I have heard plenty of Nickelback unfortunately and all that's just I think we can all agree Nickelback sucks all right next email sorry

2147
02:34:52,947 --> 02:34:55,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Seasons Greetings and Salutations, OLR.

2148
02:34:55,289 --> 02:34:56,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I love when people say that.

2149
02:34:56,330 --> 02:34:57,651
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what movie that line came from?

2150
02:34:58,171 --> 02:34:58,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Heathers.

2151
02:34:59,812 --> 02:35:01,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Greetings and Salutations.

2152
02:35:01,193 --> 02:35:01,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Heathers.

2153
02:35:01,914 --> 02:35:02,514
[SPEAKER_02]: That movie is great.

2154
02:35:02,534 --> 02:35:03,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to watch that.

2155
02:35:03,515 --> 02:35:04,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Had Shannon Doherty in it.

2156
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:05,156
[SPEAKER_05]: She was awesome.

2157
02:35:05,917 --> 02:35:06,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So was Winona Ryder.

2158
02:35:06,717 --> 02:35:07,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Winona Ryder.

2159
02:35:07,698 --> 02:35:09,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I want her to be my sister or something.

2160
02:35:09,779 --> 02:35:17,465
[SPEAKER_05]: When Winona Ryder showed up... My dream family is like George Takei as my daddy and Winona Ryder as like my cool older sister.

2161
02:35:18,326 --> 02:35:19,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Betty White as your grandma.

2162
02:35:19,126 --> 02:35:19,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Betty White is my grandmother.

2163
02:35:19,967 --> 02:35:20,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

2164
02:35:22,495 --> 02:35:25,497
[SPEAKER_02]: When Winona Ryder showed up in Star Trek, I was so excited.

2165
02:35:25,798 --> 02:35:28,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, and then they cut like half her scenes.

2166
02:35:28,340 --> 02:35:29,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so disappointing.

2167
02:35:29,561 --> 02:35:30,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

2168
02:35:30,301 --> 02:35:30,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anyway.

2169
02:35:31,182 --> 02:35:33,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Firstly, I hope Rob is recovering from the VOG plague.

2170
02:35:33,924 --> 02:35:38,228
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I heard it affect Jess from USL, then Shane from Horde House, now Alan and Rob.

2171
02:35:38,468 --> 02:35:42,271
[SPEAKER_05]: To prevent yourselves from getting the plague, all VOG members should perform the anti-VOG plague ritual.

2172
02:35:42,351 --> 02:35:46,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It involves a dead hippo, burnt out TV tubes, short bits of string, and fire-breathing squirrel.

2173
02:35:47,555 --> 02:35:47,635
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2174
02:35:47,956 --> 02:35:48,056
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2175
02:35:48,675 --> 02:35:50,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel a lot better today than I did yesterday.

2176
02:35:51,517 --> 02:35:54,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a temperature and I'm not congested in the head.

2177
02:35:54,358 --> 02:35:55,899
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just I have stuffiness.

2178
02:35:55,939 --> 02:35:57,040
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll be back to work tomorrow.

2179
02:35:57,060 --> 02:36:00,682
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sucks to be sick on a weekend when I had social stuff planned.

2180
02:36:01,842 --> 02:36:03,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I love everybody in the chat.

2181
02:36:04,263 --> 02:36:05,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris1 and I know they really suck.

2182
02:36:08,507 --> 02:36:13,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, the reason I am emailing you all is because this week has been a significant week for my mobile gaming.

2183
02:36:14,130 --> 02:36:17,452
[SPEAKER_05]: For the past few months, I've been playing a mobile game called Jurassic Park Builder.

2184
02:36:18,092 --> 02:36:23,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically your run-of-the-mill sim game involving filling your park with dinosaurs and leveling them to create cash.

2185
02:36:23,615 --> 02:36:24,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2186
02:36:46,914 --> 02:36:52,026
[SPEAKER_05]: With that being said, have you ever encountered an update on a non-MMO game that changed the very nature of the original game?

2187
02:36:52,407 --> 02:36:53,750
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you feel about those changes?

2188
02:36:53,950 --> 02:36:55,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so sincerely, Degenerate Johnny.

2189
02:36:56,254 --> 02:37:01,756
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really tough question because in this day and age, I mean, we're used to the whole patching and things like that.

2190
02:37:01,796 --> 02:37:07,539
[SPEAKER_02]: But, like, you know, that's something new in the past 10 years where games are updated like that and changed like that.

2191
02:37:07,559 --> 02:37:08,779
[SPEAKER_02]: That's only new since iPhone.

2192
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:10,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly can't think of anything.

2193
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:11,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I know one.

2194
02:37:12,741 --> 02:37:13,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Mortal Kombat 2.

2195
02:37:13,621 --> 02:37:13,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2196
02:37:14,502 --> 02:37:18,944
[SPEAKER_05]: From the beta versions to the new ones because you lost your infinite combos as they tweak stuff.

2197
02:37:19,084 --> 02:37:19,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

2198
02:37:19,864 --> 02:37:39,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous on the iPhone actually made it playable because the first version was awful but then they actually changed the control scheme and it's actually playable that was a big one let me say this though, I'll answer the question with this so I'm going to take it a slightly different direction, sorry about it but back in the day I remember when sequels would go in really random directions

2199
02:37:39,406 --> 02:37:53,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Zelda 2 Right, Zelda 2 for better or worse I did a Let's Remember this week, plug plug On my YouTube channel, Rob Roberts Plays YouTube.com slash Rob Roberts Plays, plug plug But I did a Let's Remember for the game Donkey Kong 3 Yes, that one was bizarre Wasn't it?

2200
02:37:53,673 --> 02:37:59,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was very bizarre Because it was such a departure And I even talked about this in the video Such a departure from Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.

2201
02:37:59,556 --> 02:38:02,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Because those two were platformers Although I think it had more in common with Jr.

2202
02:38:02,658 --> 02:38:04,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Donkey Kong 3 was a fucking shooter game

2203
02:38:04,679 --> 02:38:07,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but... Disguised as Donkey, with the Donkey Kong skin on it.

2204
02:38:07,861 --> 02:38:13,065
[SPEAKER_05]: But the otherwise look of the game, I think, had more in common with Junior.

2205
02:38:13,305 --> 02:38:14,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for the fact that... The aesthetic was the same.

2206
02:38:14,967 --> 02:38:19,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Stanley disappeared, never to be seen again, except in obscure references in Smash Bros.

2207
02:38:19,070 --> 02:38:19,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

2208
02:38:20,110 --> 02:38:22,311
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think was in a Game & Watch game but that's really it.

2209
02:38:22,631 --> 02:38:28,072
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think about like back in the NES games sometimes sequels were really radical departures from the original games.

2210
02:38:28,272 --> 02:38:28,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

2211
02:38:29,172 --> 02:38:37,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Even like Castlevania 2 really played I mean sure it was still the whole like jump and whip and all that type of stuff that the first game had.

2212
02:38:37,934 --> 02:38:39,435
[SPEAKER_05]: But what a terrible night for a curse.

2213
02:38:39,535 --> 02:38:44,776
[SPEAKER_02]: But the first game was more of an arcade game where the second game was more of an adventure you know backdrop.

2214
02:38:44,796 --> 02:38:46,356
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more of an annoying game.

2215
02:38:46,856 --> 02:38:48,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the sequel though.

2216
02:38:48,497 --> 02:38:49,097
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 was great.

2217
02:38:49,517 --> 02:38:52,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that's the best we can do with the answers there.

2218
02:38:52,559 --> 02:38:55,940
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, SSJ100 Matt says that Heathers is going to be an off-Broadway show.

2219
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:58,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to say in chat as well, Ragenator talking about Heathers.

2220
02:38:59,222 --> 02:39:04,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragenator in chat says, Heathers also gave us the line, Well, fuck me gently with a chainsaw.

2221
02:39:05,305 --> 02:39:05,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

2222
02:39:05,986 --> 02:39:09,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It also gave us the line, Big fun was one.

2223
02:39:09,608 --> 02:39:09,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Big fun.

2224
02:39:10,328 --> 02:39:12,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love my dead gay son.

2225
02:39:18,133 --> 02:39:20,876
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a fan of Orange Launch Radio, you do need to watch the movie Heathers.

2226
02:39:20,916 --> 02:39:22,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen the movie Heathers, Loki?

2227
02:39:22,117 --> 02:39:22,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell me you've seen Heathers.

2228
02:39:23,398 --> 02:39:23,539
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2229
02:39:23,779 --> 02:39:25,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Loki!

2230
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:26,081
[SPEAKER_02]: You're killing me!

2231
02:39:26,121 --> 02:39:26,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

2232
02:39:26,822 --> 02:39:27,843
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best movie!

2233
02:39:31,026 --> 02:39:32,428
[SPEAKER_05]: It also was like

2234
02:39:34,785 --> 02:39:37,451
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to play it on Comedy Central like every other day.

2235
02:39:37,912 --> 02:39:40,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Great pate, but I really must dash if I'm going to meet that funeral.

2236
02:39:40,857 --> 02:39:42,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

2237
02:39:43,964 --> 02:39:45,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch Heathers this holiday season.

2238
02:39:45,807 --> 02:39:46,649
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll thank us later.

2239
02:39:46,972 --> 02:39:52,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the movie that got Que Sera Sera stuck in my head every time someone says the name Heather.

2240
02:39:54,453 --> 02:39:58,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Que Sera Sera Anyway, last email.

2241
02:39:59,694 --> 02:40:12,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Orange Lounge Radio, with the release of some less than stellar Wii U and Super Mario 3D World sales figures this week, this past week, sorry, it has been provided yet another excuse for doom and gloom for the console.

2242
02:40:12,877 --> 02:40:41,990
[SPEAKER_05]: this led me to wonder when exactly sales figures started mattering to people who aren't investors more than liking the games of the systems that were being played I myself have loved my Wii U since release date and it has absolutely changed how gaming has fit into my life my boyfriend has become an avid gamer due to a mixture of first party titles and indie releases that he would never have bothered playing elsewhere the system never fails to create memories at parties and Nintendo's mastery of the couch co-op style of gameplay is still as evident as ever

2243
02:40:43,274 --> 02:40:55,162
[SPEAKER_05]: but even loving the system as much as I do I am still given pause to doubt myself when I hear people focus so heavily on something as impersonal as sales data as something that should speak to the quality of a system

2244
02:40:56,844 --> 02:40:57,185
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2245
02:41:21,227 --> 02:41:49,311
[SPEAKER_05]: so my question to you is this now that companies make such public displays of game sales and sales data for gaming related products are so easy to locate is liking a product enough I'm always willing to speak well for titles I enjoy never to the exclusion of others whenever the topic arises but is there something else that can be done to improve the image of products such as Super Mario 3D World which will likely have its spectacular reviews overshadowed by being one of the lowest selling 3D Mario titles ever

2246
02:41:52,179 --> 02:41:52,559
[SPEAKER_02]: was that it?

2247
02:41:53,441 --> 02:42:09,720
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you for the entertainment you provide each week and Daniel because I don't say last names on there I think that was a good email and thank you for that and thank you for your masterful grammar sales shouldn't matter to your enjoyment of the game

2248
02:42:10,054 --> 02:42:10,474
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it shouldn't.

2249
02:42:10,594 --> 02:42:14,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, don't we all, I mean, Oh, for fuck's sake, I like Xanadu.

2250
02:42:15,936 --> 02:42:17,937
[SPEAKER_02]: But haven't we talked about this on a previous show as well?

2251
02:42:17,957 --> 02:42:23,219
[SPEAKER_02]: There's those cult games that maybe not everybody necessarily played, but you love, right?

2252
02:42:23,259 --> 02:42:27,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I talked about, there's a great card game called Cold Sept that's like Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering.

2253
02:42:28,041 --> 02:42:28,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Love those games.

2254
02:42:28,981 --> 02:42:30,482
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, they don't sell beans here.

2255
02:42:30,522 --> 02:42:35,364
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I think they didn't even come out with a 3DS version here because those games didn't sell very well, which was a tragedy.

2256
02:42:35,924 --> 02:42:38,365
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, yeah, you should like what you're going to like.

2257
02:42:39,510 --> 02:42:43,034
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be no shame in your game.

2258
02:42:43,275 --> 02:42:48,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I love bad movies better than some of the top rated Oscar winning movies ever.

2259
02:42:48,460 --> 02:42:51,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up Barbarella recently and I fucking love that movie because Jane Fonda was hot.

2260
02:42:52,064 --> 02:42:52,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2261
02:42:53,586 --> 02:42:54,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean...

2262
02:42:57,592 --> 02:42:59,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It shouldn't be a guilty pleasure.

2263
02:42:59,593 --> 02:43:01,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It should just be a pleasure.

2264
02:43:01,394 --> 02:43:03,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you love it, fucking love it.

2265
02:43:03,755 --> 02:43:09,258
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter how well or how niche or how many copies is sold or anything.

2266
02:43:09,278 --> 02:43:10,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like what you like.

2267
02:43:10,479 --> 02:43:11,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2268
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:13,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right.

2269
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:20,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of... Well, it's the whole thing about some people feel that theirs has to be the best, that theirs is better than everybody else.

2270
02:43:20,204 --> 02:43:21,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that whole fanboyism.

2271
02:43:22,345 --> 02:43:23,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, in the chat?

2272
02:43:23,246 --> 02:43:23,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2273
02:43:23,726 --> 02:43:23,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2274
02:43:24,406 --> 02:43:25,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that awesome...

2275
02:43:25,547 --> 02:43:29,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you, Awesome Unicorn, because I also read grammar and etymology books for fun.

2276
02:43:30,251 --> 02:43:33,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You should change your nick to Awesome Emailing Unicorn.

2277
02:43:35,316 --> 02:43:35,996
[SPEAKER_02]: What was I going to say?

2278
02:43:38,739 --> 02:43:40,720
[SPEAKER_02]: You made me lose my tangent with that.

2279
02:43:41,281 --> 02:43:41,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I lose my thought.

2280
02:43:43,277 --> 02:43:46,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Barbarella, Psychedella.

2281
02:43:47,039 --> 02:43:50,200
[SPEAKER_02]: But people should play whatever they want and like it.

2282
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:51,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, the fanboyism.

2283
02:43:51,781 --> 02:43:58,744
[SPEAKER_02]: People will use sales figures and wield it as a weapon as something like, look at what's going on with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2284
02:43:58,884 --> 02:44:00,385
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both selling well.

2285
02:44:00,845 --> 02:44:05,889
[SPEAKER_02]: But still the fanboys are going to say, oh, well, but it's because the number of regions this is selling in.

2286
02:44:05,909 --> 02:44:08,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because of, you know, such and such.

2287
02:44:08,150 --> 02:44:10,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be fair, we've asked those same questions on the show.

2288
02:44:11,032 --> 02:44:15,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's because we know there's spin going into this from Microsoft and Sony.

2289
02:44:15,555 --> 02:44:19,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are kind of curious, like, which one is selling a little better.

2290
02:44:19,498 --> 02:44:22,000
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't make the other system worse necessarily.

2291
02:44:22,480 --> 02:44:23,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Wii U owner.

2292
02:44:24,221 --> 02:44:46,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my Wii U an awful lot even though I didn't necessarily care for the wonderful 101 and I'm gonna hear shit about that non-stop this week but I love Mario 3D World it is one of my top five games of the year for sure and I know Nintendo's gonna put out some great stuff for it in 2014 and there are more reasons to buy a Wii U right now than there are to buy a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One

2293
02:44:47,182 --> 02:44:48,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that be the same story in 2014?

2294
02:44:49,304 --> 02:44:52,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm a little worried about for Nintendo's sake.

2295
02:44:53,248 --> 02:44:54,749
[SPEAKER_02]: But 3DS will keep them afloat.

2296
02:44:54,809 --> 02:44:55,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

2297
02:44:56,251 --> 02:44:57,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Like whatever you're going to like.

2298
02:44:57,272 --> 02:45:01,616
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of great games to justify a Wii U purchase.

2299
02:45:02,396 --> 02:45:05,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Love is not wrong, but it can sometimes be really gross and sticky.

2300
02:45:07,651 --> 02:45:07,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2301
02:45:08,971 --> 02:45:09,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

2302
02:45:10,212 --> 02:45:10,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Yerp.

2303
02:45:10,712 --> 02:45:11,592
[SPEAKER_02]: That is it for emails.

2304
02:45:11,632 --> 02:45:16,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com And by the way, I would like to go back and still thank NARP for the email.

2305
02:45:17,493 --> 02:45:20,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being honest with us and making your opinion known.

2306
02:45:20,554 --> 02:45:21,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I said thank you for that email as well, didn't I?

2307
02:45:21,954 --> 02:45:25,074
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't say thank you and I'm saying thank you so he doesn't think I'm a total bitch.

2308
02:45:25,094 --> 02:45:26,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only a 95% bitch.

2309
02:45:27,635 --> 02:45:31,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to Jenner and Johnny too because I don't think we thanked him for the email either.

2310
02:45:31,096 --> 02:45:33,116
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you Unicorn Friend with the great grammar.

2311
02:45:35,222 --> 02:45:38,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you to everybody who takes the time out of the week to say hello to us.

2312
02:45:38,184 --> 02:45:38,504
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

2313
02:45:38,524 --> 02:45:42,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you to anybody else who loves Xanadu and Barbarella because those are the two best movies ever.

2314
02:45:43,908 --> 02:45:44,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no.

2315
02:45:45,389 --> 02:45:47,890
[SPEAKER_05]: You watched them at my bachelorette party.

2316
02:45:47,931 --> 02:45:48,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

2317
02:45:48,251 --> 02:45:50,472
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were eating jello shots.

2318
02:45:50,532 --> 02:45:51,413
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this fuckery?

2319
02:45:51,493 --> 02:45:54,015
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was awesome because I fucking love those movies.

2320
02:45:54,035 --> 02:45:57,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, then again, I love showgirls and that's my Halloween tradition is to watch showgirls.

2321
02:45:57,817 --> 02:46:01,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Which we did at my house and drank wine and watched showgirls and it was great.

2322
02:46:01,299 --> 02:46:02,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And Miss Monet was with us.

2323
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:03,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Is she a gamer?

2324
02:46:03,281 --> 02:46:04,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we need to get her on the show.

2325
02:46:04,341 --> 02:46:04,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think she is.

2326
02:46:05,439 --> 02:46:06,861
[SPEAKER_05]: But we should have her on the show anyway.

2327
02:46:06,941 --> 02:46:07,421
[SPEAKER_02]: We should.

2328
02:46:07,522 --> 02:46:09,163
[SPEAKER_02]: She can teach a pole dancing class during the show.

2329
02:46:09,224 --> 02:46:10,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friend Monet is a pole dancer.

2330
02:46:10,865 --> 02:46:12,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to work with Monet, which I knew Monet before.

2331
02:46:13,869 --> 02:46:15,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew Rob, and I knew Monet separately.

2332
02:46:16,732 --> 02:46:18,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I found out that they knew each other.

2333
02:46:18,574 --> 02:46:20,577
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like my circle of Rob.

2334
02:46:20,677 --> 02:46:20,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2335
02:46:21,538 --> 02:46:24,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's Kat and... Yeah, Kat through Rocky.

2336
02:46:24,261 --> 02:46:25,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys know Mystique.

2337
02:46:25,522 --> 02:46:25,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2338
02:46:28,525 --> 02:46:31,507
[SPEAKER_02]: For my birthday party last year, Monet had a pole dancing class.

2339
02:46:31,527 --> 02:46:36,891
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about this on Horde House because Extifer came to the pole dancing class and he was really good at it.

2340
02:46:36,931 --> 02:46:37,632
[SPEAKER_02]: This was so random.

2341
02:46:37,652 --> 02:46:42,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently him and Monet ran into each other at a postal service concert and they remembered each other.

2342
02:46:42,856 --> 02:46:44,858
[SPEAKER_02]: The world is such a small, funny place sometimes.

2343
02:46:46,459 --> 02:46:49,501
[SPEAKER_05]: There was mention on my Facebook about doing a Cards Against Humanity session.

2344
02:46:49,661 --> 02:46:50,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

2345
02:46:50,342 --> 02:46:52,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been getting my 12 days of Cards Against Humanity.

2346
02:46:54,585 --> 02:47:00,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this is too much talking about people that our listeners don't know, so we need to get into the F- We need to introduce our listeners to these people.

2347
02:47:00,550 --> 02:47:00,770
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

2348
02:47:00,810 --> 02:47:02,011
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get into the F-U's of the week.

2349
02:47:18,244 --> 02:47:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, F-U's of the week.

2350
02:47:21,587 --> 02:47:21,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good.

2351
02:47:22,588 --> 02:47:23,168
[SPEAKER_05]: F-U to the sick.

2352
02:47:23,448 --> 02:47:23,949
[SPEAKER_05]: F-U to the plague.

2353
02:47:25,109 --> 02:47:43,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I will follow her because I have the exact same FU FU to the fact that I got sick especially when I had a weekend where I actually had a bunch of stuff planned I was supposed to go wine tasting with friends this weekend who drove up from out of town and I couldn't fucking go but they did the most adorable thing for me and I just love friends hugs and kisses if you guys are out there listening

2354
02:47:44,862 --> 02:47:51,967
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was supposed to go to a big holiday party with some of my friends here locally and that was supposed to be Friday night.

2355
02:47:52,007 --> 02:47:55,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't go because I was sick and it's rude to go to a dinner party when you're sick and cough on all the food.

2356
02:47:56,689 --> 02:47:57,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So, boo!

2357
02:47:58,831 --> 02:47:59,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

2358
02:48:00,031 --> 02:48:00,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

2359
02:48:01,352 --> 02:48:07,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just F'ed to the fact that I still have to heal up for a while before I can actually eat real food.

2360
02:48:07,476 --> 02:48:07,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

2361
02:48:10,257 --> 02:48:12,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's giving FUs tonight to Conditions.

2362
02:48:13,241 --> 02:48:13,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a theme tonight.

2363
02:48:14,002 --> 02:48:15,603
[SPEAKER_07]: You should puree some turkey.

2364
02:48:15,663 --> 02:48:16,604
[SPEAKER_07]: And why not?

2365
02:48:16,705 --> 02:48:20,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give an FU to Volition and Deep Silver for their fucking broken-ass game.

2366
02:48:21,970 --> 02:48:22,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to play that.

2367
02:48:23,232 --> 02:48:24,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I have another FU.

2368
02:48:24,854 --> 02:48:25,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

2369
02:48:25,154 --> 02:48:26,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes to you and Victoria.

2370
02:48:26,976 --> 02:48:27,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, FU.

2371
02:48:28,237 --> 02:48:29,179
[SPEAKER_05]: For Frivalo.

2372
02:48:30,291 --> 02:48:31,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's great wine, isn't it?

2373
02:48:31,432 --> 02:48:34,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I bought a bottle, and normally I'm not a sweet wine person.

2374
02:48:34,755 --> 02:48:38,037
[SPEAKER_05]: As I described this to Victoria, it tastes like angels pissed in my cup.

2375
02:48:39,539 --> 02:48:40,239
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing.

2376
02:48:42,141 --> 02:48:43,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Frivolo's really good.

2377
02:48:43,262 --> 02:48:45,544
[SPEAKER_02]: That winery should pay me money for that endorsement.

2378
02:48:45,944 --> 02:48:47,425
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, don't buy it at Whole Foods.

2379
02:48:47,465 --> 02:48:48,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Total Wine because it's four bucks cheaper.

2380
02:48:49,207 --> 02:48:49,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

2381
02:48:49,847 --> 02:48:50,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just go to the winery.

2382
02:48:50,768 --> 02:48:51,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not far.

2383
02:48:51,368 --> 02:48:52,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you live here.

2384
02:48:53,230 --> 02:48:54,131
[SPEAKER_05]: You've never taken me.

2385
02:48:54,351 --> 02:48:55,752
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to take me, Rob, next time you go.

2386
02:48:56,813 --> 02:48:57,073
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2387
02:48:57,693 --> 02:48:58,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's see.

2388
02:48:59,734 --> 02:49:00,514
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do I want to say?

2389
02:49:01,395 --> 02:49:02,715
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a couple more stories for you guys.

2390
02:49:02,795 --> 02:49:07,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR and our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2391
02:49:07,897 --> 02:49:09,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I've got to admit, I'm a little bit worried.

2392
02:49:09,478 --> 02:49:11,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby didn't have a single caller tonight on his show.

2393
02:49:11,759 --> 02:49:14,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to get people to call into Orange Launch Radio?

2394
02:49:14,300 --> 02:49:14,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall see.

2395
02:49:15,761 --> 02:49:16,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming up in a moment.

2396
02:49:16,521 --> 02:49:18,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, some quick stories here.

2397
02:49:18,242 --> 02:49:18,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2398
02:49:19,322 --> 02:49:21,724
[SPEAKER_07]: The Oculus Rift is moving along.

2399
02:49:21,824 --> 02:49:32,512
[SPEAKER_07]: They just received $75 million in funding from the venture capital firm Andresen Horowitz, led by Mark Anderson Horowitz.

2400
02:49:35,554 --> 02:49:38,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does it seem like there's too many, or Andreessen?

2401
02:49:39,276 --> 02:49:41,177
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too many letters in these words.

2402
02:49:42,098 --> 02:49:43,599
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like they have extra E's in there.

2403
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:48,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, and he's the founder of Netscape.

2404
02:49:49,522 --> 02:49:50,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, I remember Netscape.

2405
02:49:50,763 --> 02:49:53,304
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the browser to go to before Firefox.

2406
02:49:53,344 --> 02:49:53,804
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

2407
02:49:54,024 --> 02:49:54,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Netscape was the bomb.

2408
02:49:55,125 --> 02:49:55,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2409
02:49:55,585 --> 02:49:57,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Dial into Prodigy, then fire up Netscape.

2410
02:49:57,726 --> 02:50:01,048
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what we used to call it back when I was on AOL because there was a big rivalry?

2411
02:50:01,188 --> 02:50:01,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutscape.

2412
02:50:01,729 --> 02:50:02,009
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

2413
02:50:02,449 --> 02:50:03,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Prodigy, I mean.

2414
02:50:03,069 --> 02:50:03,870
[SPEAKER_05]: We called it Buttigy.

2415
02:50:04,210 --> 02:50:04,511
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew,

2416
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:43,461
[SPEAKER_07]: uh yes my first website was designed in Netscape that shit was the bomb um so anyways so they um apparently they liked what they saw and you know I'm sure 75 million dollars in funding can only help um they've already secured I guess previously 16 million dollars in the first round of funding in June so I'm very uh very curious to see what happens hopefully one day I will have an Oculus Rift myself but uh

2417
02:50:45,523 --> 02:50:46,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting closer.

2418
02:50:46,984 --> 02:50:54,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting closer to this total immersion future or something.

2419
02:50:55,487 --> 02:51:01,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says, On Prodigy, we just called AOL, AOL because that was insulting enough.

2420
02:51:02,689 --> 02:51:04,210
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I remember AOL when it was DOS.

2421
02:51:05,578 --> 02:51:26,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when it was free because they kept sending you those 30 day trials No, I remember having a phish account I didn't phish it either I remember when AOL was Quantum Link on the Commodore 64 and yeah, I used to dial into BBSs on my 300 baud modem It's hardcore, bitches, hardcore

2422
02:51:27,697 --> 02:51:38,441
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I still have my same, when they went to where you could have your free accounts, I actually still have the same username on my AIM from that account.

2423
02:51:38,601 --> 02:51:39,361
[SPEAKER_05]: It's DarkSakura.

2424
02:51:39,621 --> 02:51:40,001
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.

2425
02:51:40,021 --> 02:51:41,382
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hide so no one can find me.

2426
02:51:41,582 --> 02:51:44,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, wait a minute, now you're going to get tons of AOL instant messages.

2427
02:51:44,803 --> 02:51:45,283
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not.

2428
02:51:45,403 --> 02:51:46,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Who uses instant messenger anymore?

2429
02:51:46,784 --> 02:51:48,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and Becky and Victoria.

2430
02:51:48,124 --> 02:51:48,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

2431
02:51:48,724 --> 02:51:49,205
[SPEAKER_05]: A few people.

2432
02:51:49,365 --> 02:51:49,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2433
02:51:49,925 --> 02:51:50,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I never use it.

2434
02:51:50,605 --> 02:51:53,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the people are people I've been friends with from my old AOL days.

2435
02:51:53,986 --> 02:51:55,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't use Facebook Messenger either.

2436
02:51:56,107 --> 02:51:59,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a messenger that I prefer but even then I only talk to like two people on it.

2437
02:51:59,795 --> 02:52:06,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I only keep AIM up because there's maybe like a handful of people and sometimes some of my friends from Alabama are on it.

2438
02:52:06,067 --> 02:52:07,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all text messages now.

2439
02:52:07,469 --> 02:52:08,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of where people went.

2440
02:52:08,487 --> 02:52:09,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's easier to type.

2441
02:52:09,968 --> 02:52:10,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I understand.

2442
02:52:11,209 --> 02:52:21,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one more story for you guys, and don't read too much into this, but it's very exciting to know that Nintendo has renewed the trademark for Metroid Prime.

2443
02:52:21,799 --> 02:52:27,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people are doing, you know, shaking and crying because, ooh, this means there's going to be a new Metroid Prime on Wii U.

2444
02:52:27,964 --> 02:52:28,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there might be.

2445
02:52:28,765 --> 02:52:29,285
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

2446
02:52:29,365 --> 02:52:42,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would certainly make a lot of sense for Retro to go and do another Metroid Prime game for the Wii U. But we do know that the trademark was renewed on August 13, 2013, probably just to protect, you know, the games that already exist.

2447
02:52:43,194 --> 02:52:46,336
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know Nintendo loves to package up its old shit eventually.

2448
02:52:46,356 --> 02:52:52,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the next Nintendo console, we'll probably have GameCube games and Wii games downloadable.

2449
02:52:53,260 --> 02:52:56,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, they just want to keep that trademark out there for sure.

2450
02:52:56,322 --> 02:52:58,863
[SPEAKER_02]: But wouldn't it be nice to have another Metroid Prime game?

2451
02:52:59,584 --> 02:53:02,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that will be their ace in the hole at E3.

2452
02:53:02,626 --> 02:53:02,926
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2453
02:53:04,892 --> 02:53:05,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2454
02:53:27,034 --> 02:53:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line.

2455
02:53:29,296 --> 02:53:29,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's open.

2456
02:53:29,776 --> 02:53:32,719
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype.

2457
02:53:32,879 --> 02:53:34,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2458
02:53:34,420 --> 02:53:36,221
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give us a call right now if you'd like.

2459
02:53:36,642 --> 02:53:40,785
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's anything you want to share or talk about maybe that we didn't bring up or something we did bring up.

2460
02:53:40,805 --> 02:53:41,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

2461
02:53:42,386 --> 02:53:44,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call and we will talk about it.

2462
02:53:45,388 --> 02:53:51,593
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, I'm going to go to Twitter topics and see if Loki has any last minute stories or Dark Sakura.

2463
02:53:51,633 --> 02:53:51,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

2464
02:53:52,494 --> 02:53:52,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

2465
02:53:52,834 --> 02:53:56,297
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't really have anything at the moment.

2466
02:53:57,250 --> 02:54:00,232
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, good thing the phone is ringing and we can actually go to some calls.

2467
02:54:00,272 --> 02:54:01,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2468
02:54:01,333 --> 02:54:01,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2469
02:54:02,393 --> 02:54:05,335
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one with the fastest internet finger in the whole wide internet chat.

2470
02:54:05,415 --> 02:54:05,936
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Ranma.

2471
02:54:06,016 --> 02:54:07,176
[SPEAKER_02]: You're very good at this, Ranma.

2472
02:54:07,196 --> 02:54:07,917
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2473
02:54:08,577 --> 02:54:09,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I do try.

2474
02:54:09,358 --> 02:54:13,220
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some topics I do want to cover real quick, and I got to be on my merry little way.

2475
02:54:13,340 --> 02:54:13,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2476
02:54:14,401 --> 02:54:20,705
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I feel with Loki, with the whole dentist thing, because once I went to, I have my

2477
02:54:21,574 --> 02:54:40,334
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 Impacted Teeth Pulled Out Before I Had To Do An 8 Hour Shift At Work Oh God I'm Thinking Okay Get It Done Drop Off The Meds Go To Work Won't Be That Big Of A Deal 20 Minutes Into My Shift I'm Like It Hurts It Hurts

2478
02:54:41,769 --> 02:54:43,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Take my break, grab the meds.

2479
02:54:43,490 --> 02:54:47,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I was pretty much floating on cloud nine for the next eight hours after that.

2480
02:54:49,974 --> 02:54:52,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my, how did you even work a shift on those?

2481
02:54:52,836 --> 02:54:55,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe you didn't just somehow get the day off or something.

2482
02:54:55,938 --> 02:54:56,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2483
02:54:56,819 --> 02:54:58,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a high tolerance for pain.

2484
02:54:59,161 --> 02:55:02,803
[SPEAKER_06]: There was that time that I dislocated my knee and they gave me Tylenol 3.

2485
02:55:03,884 --> 02:55:05,325
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave me a weak prescription.

2486
02:55:05,425 --> 02:55:06,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I only needed it for one day.

2487
02:55:07,106 --> 02:55:07,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

2488
02:55:10,233 --> 02:55:10,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2489
02:55:11,134 --> 02:55:14,075
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole YouTube debacle about them flagging videos.

2490
02:55:14,256 --> 02:55:14,816
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

2491
02:55:15,016 --> 02:55:15,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

2492
02:55:16,717 --> 02:55:21,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel those users' pains because some of my videos get flagged as well.

2493
02:55:22,119 --> 02:55:32,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our OLR episodes that have been posted on YouTube are getting flagged, and it's making me question if we should continue to do it, to be honest, because it was all a kind of experiment anyway.

2494
02:55:32,183 --> 02:55:38,286
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's been a couple people who have been very vocal about their support of the YouTube posting, so I am trying to stick it out for them.

2495
02:55:39,246 --> 02:55:42,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so very nice that they welcome us with open arms.

2496
02:55:42,787 --> 02:55:44,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, you fucking stole that shit.

2497
02:55:45,248 --> 02:55:46,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you make that?

2498
02:55:46,109 --> 02:55:47,709
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel, but whatever.

2499
02:55:47,869 --> 02:55:48,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry, Rama.

2500
02:55:49,910 --> 02:55:51,591
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool, it's cool, because the issue is...

2501
02:55:52,389 --> 02:56:02,291
[SPEAKER_06]: With my videos, the Japanese come to make the albums of Sony, EMI, and them.

2502
02:56:02,711 --> 02:56:14,674
[SPEAKER_06]: They will have the videos flagged because us videographers who record masquerades, they realize we didn't get permission to use their music in the video, and I'm like,

2503
02:56:15,856 --> 02:56:17,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't put the song there.

2504
02:56:17,677 --> 02:56:18,998
[SPEAKER_06]: It was part of the skit.

2505
02:56:19,098 --> 02:56:21,640
[SPEAKER_06]: It was part of the musical or whatever.

2506
02:56:21,921 --> 02:56:25,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just put back, I just, under fair use, leave me alone, please.

2507
02:56:25,903 --> 02:56:28,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Worst case scenario, some countries can't see my videos.

2508
02:56:28,966 --> 02:56:29,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2509
02:56:30,227 --> 02:56:32,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, that's so irritating to even have to go through that, you know?

2510
02:56:33,029 --> 02:56:34,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2511
02:56:34,890 --> 02:56:37,212
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole 38 Studios bid, I'll tell you what.

2512
02:56:38,032 --> 02:56:38,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I will give 38 Studios...

2513
02:56:41,260 --> 02:56:43,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair value for all their franchises.

2514
02:56:44,545 --> 02:56:43,463
$20.

2515
02:56:44,645 --> 02:56:48,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe I'm being more than fair.

2516
02:56:48,511 --> 02:56:50,374
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even the price of the game.

2517
02:56:52,397 --> 02:56:53,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe it is now, actually.

2518
02:56:53,639 --> 02:56:54,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong.

2519
02:56:54,660 --> 02:56:55,702
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be the price of the game now.

2520
02:56:58,312 --> 02:57:02,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking there's not a lot of call out there for a sequel to Kingdoms of Amalur.

2521
02:57:02,213 --> 02:57:04,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I know some people really liked it.

2522
02:57:04,194 --> 02:57:05,214
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like I heard nothing.

2523
02:57:05,534 --> 02:57:07,015
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it was a crap game.

2524
02:57:07,355 --> 02:57:08,995
[SPEAKER_02]: It was decent from what I hear.

2525
02:57:09,095 --> 02:57:12,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually kind of surprised no one wants the sequel rights.

2526
02:57:12,657 --> 02:57:14,217
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever.

2527
02:57:16,598 --> 02:57:17,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

2528
02:57:17,789 --> 02:57:23,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and last thing before I get out of here, I am returning to my Pokemon roots.

2529
02:57:24,277 --> 02:57:26,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you going back to red and blue, or what are you doing?

2530
02:57:27,561 --> 02:57:28,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing the game again.

2531
02:57:28,782 --> 02:57:31,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked up a copy of Y. You know what?

2532
02:57:31,085 --> 02:57:32,847
[SPEAKER_02]: The new 3DS games are really good.

2533
02:57:33,267 --> 02:57:34,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you having fun with it so far?

2534
02:57:35,149 --> 02:57:36,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's still sealed.

2535
02:57:36,890 --> 02:57:41,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I told myself I am not unwrapping Y till I finish A Link Between Worlds.

2536
02:57:42,533 --> 02:57:47,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fair, because I was going to say, if you're going to sit there with an unopened copy of the game, I will sick Shane Alinko on you.

2537
02:57:48,335 --> 02:57:49,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And he will use his powers.

2538
02:57:49,876 --> 02:57:54,318
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I'm fairly certain that Dan's gifting me that for a holiday mess.

2539
02:57:55,759 --> 02:58:01,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting X. I told him I wanted X. So you'll have somebody to trade Pokemans with.

2540
02:58:02,122 --> 02:58:04,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I only bought the game for one reason.

2541
02:58:05,429 --> 02:58:08,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Toys R Us had it on sale last week for $20.

2542
02:58:08,993 --> 02:58:10,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I got Best Buy to price match it.

2543
02:58:10,555 --> 02:58:11,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

2544
02:58:11,055 --> 02:58:11,636
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good deal.

2545
02:58:11,716 --> 02:58:12,837
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a steal for that game.

2546
02:58:12,877 --> 02:58:14,279
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I did with my Mass Effect 3.

2547
02:58:14,779 --> 02:58:15,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it for $10 cheaper.

2548
02:58:15,781 --> 02:58:16,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

2549
02:58:16,962 --> 02:58:20,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And then everyone on my Facebook is like, can I get it for X?

2550
02:58:20,346 --> 02:58:20,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I get it for X?

2551
02:58:21,026 --> 02:58:22,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I don't know.

2552
02:58:22,468 --> 02:58:23,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Take it in.

2553
02:58:23,429 --> 02:58:23,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask them.

2554
02:58:23,810 --> 02:58:24,650
[SPEAKER_06]: They might be nice.

2555
02:58:24,670 --> 02:58:25,471
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of people have said...

2556
02:58:26,092 --> 02:58:30,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Best Buy was able to price match it for X as well because they're practically the same game.

2557
02:58:30,797 --> 02:58:31,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they are the same game.

2558
02:58:32,018 --> 02:58:32,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

2559
02:58:33,519 --> 02:58:35,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Ranma, thanks so much for the call.

2560
02:58:35,441 --> 02:58:36,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

2561
02:58:36,642 --> 02:58:37,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

2562
02:58:37,043 --> 02:58:37,944
[SPEAKER_02]: An anime jam session.

2563
02:58:37,984 --> 02:58:38,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody listen.

2564
02:58:38,584 --> 02:58:39,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday nights.

2565
02:58:39,625 --> 02:58:40,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, one more thing before I get out of here.

2566
02:58:42,288 --> 02:58:46,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, I do believe, is the 24th for our show.

2567
02:58:46,953 --> 02:58:49,655
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be our final show of the holiday before we take a break.

2568
02:58:49,775 --> 02:58:49,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

2569
02:58:51,342 --> 02:58:57,949
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be doing the anime jam session or getting crunked Christmas Eve special.

2570
02:58:58,229 --> 02:58:59,971
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going live on Christmas Eve?

2571
02:59:00,031 --> 02:59:00,832
[SPEAKER_02]: That's impressive.

2572
02:59:00,872 --> 02:59:01,733
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are hardcore.

2573
02:59:02,968 --> 02:59:11,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because we'd rather get drunk with our friends and guests than our own families because if we're with our families, we're going to drink anyway.

2574
02:59:12,515 --> 02:59:13,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

2575
02:59:13,856 --> 02:59:19,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I have plans with my own family on Christmas Eve, but if I get back in time, I'll join y'all for a round.

2576
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:22,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably going to have to drink to make it through our Christmas Eve.

2577
02:59:22,902 --> 02:59:23,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

2578
02:59:23,823 --> 02:59:29,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't want to spend Christmas with your family, spend Christmas with the drunken bastards at Anime Jam Session.

2579
02:59:29,887 --> 02:59:30,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

2580
02:59:30,547 --> 02:59:31,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

2581
02:59:31,047 --> 02:59:31,948
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a great show.

2582
02:59:32,008 --> 02:59:35,209
[SPEAKER_02]: But you still have one more show before that because this week coming up is the 17th.

2583
02:59:35,389 --> 02:59:37,690
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, yeah, we have a lot of stuff coming up.

2584
02:59:37,750 --> 02:59:40,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that following week, all bets are off.

2585
02:59:40,851 --> 02:59:41,651
[SPEAKER_02]: All bets are off.

2586
02:59:41,671 --> 02:59:42,131
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2587
02:59:42,191 --> 02:59:46,593
[SPEAKER_02]: This week is the Horde House holiday special, and I'm going to tell you it's a doozy.

2588
02:59:47,393 --> 02:59:48,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on to your butts.

2589
02:59:49,354 --> 02:59:51,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I only have one thing to say about that.

2590
02:59:51,695 --> 02:59:51,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

2591
02:59:52,655 --> 02:59:53,736
[SPEAKER_02]: May the fierce be with you.

2592
02:59:54,976 --> 02:59:55,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2593
02:59:55,737 --> 02:59:56,037
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2594
02:59:56,057 --> 02:59:56,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to you later.

2595
02:59:57,197 --> 02:59:57,458
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2596
02:59:57,538 --> 02:59:57,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2597
02:59:58,158 --> 02:59:59,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a Beyonce day.

2598
02:59:59,719 --> 02:59:59,999
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2599
03:00:01,540 --> 03:00:01,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, wait.

2600
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:02,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma doesn't like Beyonce.

2601
03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:03,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

2602
03:00:03,221 --> 03:00:06,162
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2603
03:00:06,302 --> 03:00:07,283
[SPEAKER_02]: May be Jesus be with you.

2604
03:00:08,303 --> 03:00:09,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Or use your name on Skype.

2605
03:00:10,124 --> 03:00:11,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2606
03:00:11,365 --> 03:00:12,045
[SPEAKER_02]: All one word.

2607
03:00:12,265 --> 03:00:16,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

2608
03:00:16,327 --> 03:00:17,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the phones.

2609
03:00:17,068 --> 03:00:17,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have another call.

2610
03:00:17,968 --> 03:00:18,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2611
03:00:18,969 --> 03:00:19,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2612
03:00:20,229 --> 03:00:21,230
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Ragenator.

2613
03:00:21,270 --> 03:00:22,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Ragenator, how you doing?

2614
03:00:23,371 --> 03:00:23,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty good.

2615
03:00:24,391 --> 03:00:25,071
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?

2616
03:00:25,672 --> 03:00:26,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, two things.

2617
03:00:26,992 --> 03:00:41,359
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to do a rant about the whole YouTube group I have, but since that's going to take a little while, I just want to get the quick thing out of the way.

2618
03:00:43,139 --> 03:00:47,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm feeling a little generous, I'm going to do a little game giveaway, a Steam game.

2619
03:00:48,282 --> 03:00:48,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2620
03:00:49,878 --> 03:01:04,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in fact, this weekend, since it was a steam sale on DinoDA, where the game was basically $2 for a single copy or a four-pack for $6, I can't figure what the hell.

2621
03:01:04,708 --> 03:01:08,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up the four-pack, keep a copy for myself, give away $8.

2622
03:01:09,231 --> 03:01:10,432
[SPEAKER_02]: He's Santinator tonight.

2623
03:01:10,592 --> 03:01:11,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight he's Santinator.

2624
03:01:13,394 --> 03:01:15,656
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't figure what the hell.

2625
03:01:16,328 --> 03:01:22,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Give away one of the copies of the game tonight on OR.

2626
03:01:22,892 --> 03:01:37,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we'll do is, well, I'm going to ask a question directly in chat, that way you guys don't get an unfair advantage because of the delay.

2627
03:01:40,675 --> 03:01:46,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first person that answers the question directly, go ahead and shout the answer out in

2628
03:01:48,030 --> 03:01:49,491
[SPEAKER_00]: No, in text, in chat, who will get the game?

2629
03:01:49,511 --> 03:01:50,812
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm posting it right now.

2630
03:01:50,852 --> 03:01:54,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let the chatters have it, but I'm almost positive I know what it is.

2631
03:01:54,855 --> 03:01:56,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have to do with cards?

2632
03:01:56,716 --> 03:01:56,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2633
03:02:16,289 --> 03:02:17,090
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say.

2634
03:02:17,250 --> 03:02:18,250
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2635
03:02:18,270 --> 03:02:19,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it does.

2636
03:02:19,190 --> 03:02:19,771
[SPEAKER_02]: There's your hint.

2637
03:02:20,191 --> 03:02:20,451
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2638
03:02:21,871 --> 03:02:24,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wanted to rant a little bit on the YouTube thing.

2639
03:02:24,092 --> 03:02:28,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm going to ask you to try to keep it a little bit concise because we do want to end the show at a reasonable hour.

2640
03:02:29,054 --> 03:02:30,314
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's your thoughts on the YouTube thing?

2641
03:02:30,915 --> 03:02:31,175
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2642
03:02:31,675 --> 03:02:32,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.

2643
03:02:32,615 --> 03:02:42,979
[SPEAKER_00]: On one hand, I know that companies be it Nintendo or Valve or Microsoft, whoever, yeah, they would like to protect their IPs.

2644
03:02:43,871 --> 03:03:03,460
[SPEAKER_00]: That's understandable, but at the same time, you know, fans being Bobby Blackwell, yourself, me, whoever, we like these games, we want to support games, and we want to promote the games.

2645
03:03:04,960 --> 03:03:08,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is show off these games, and

2646
03:03:10,313 --> 03:03:15,135
[SPEAKER_00]: We're effectively giving these games free publicity.

2647
03:03:15,575 --> 03:03:27,401
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing PR for these games and the game manufacturers are not paying us one red cent for this promotion.

2648
03:03:27,641 --> 03:03:28,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask you this though, Rachel.

2649
03:03:28,741 --> 03:03:36,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to interrupt you real quick just to ask a tough question because, you know, yes, we're giving the games free publicity, but doesn't a game maker have a right to say, I don't want that publicity?

2650
03:03:39,325 --> 03:03:40,706
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way to look at it.

2651
03:03:40,946 --> 03:03:45,167
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look at it that way or consider it.

2652
03:03:46,308 --> 03:03:53,170
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I can't figure out why a company wouldn't want free publicity for the game.

2653
03:03:53,210 --> 03:04:02,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I already mentioned that assuming that the game isn't crap, they want publicity for the games because usually they'll get extra sales.

2654
03:04:02,613 --> 03:04:07,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Casey Point earlier this year, Bobby Blackwell,

2655
03:04:07,950 --> 03:04:17,037
[SPEAKER_00]: On Twitch, he had showed off Sacred Citadel, which is the Go Force and Conquer game.

2656
03:04:17,518 --> 03:04:22,962
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw his stream and I liked the game, bought the game.

2657
03:04:23,582 --> 03:04:26,945
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what was it, Deep Silver that put the game out?

2658
03:04:27,682 --> 03:04:30,503
[SPEAKER_00]: They made $15 off of me because of their stream.

2659
03:04:51,707 --> 03:04:59,452
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's when you have these other websites like 4Gamer or Machinima or whatever and they're the ones that I get content ID matched with.

2660
03:04:59,552 --> 03:05:06,497
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not right because it wasn't their stuff to content match in the first place.

2661
03:05:06,577 --> 03:05:07,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't their game.

2662
03:05:07,637 --> 03:05:09,399
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

2663
03:05:09,419 --> 03:05:10,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2664
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:11,140
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2665
03:05:11,620 --> 03:05:12,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Rage Leader, I got to let you go.

2666
03:05:13,681 --> 03:05:17,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know though in chat who ends up winning that code and we will talk to you later.

2667
03:05:18,596 --> 03:05:19,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, have a nice night

2668
03:05:33,936 --> 03:05:38,457
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2669
03:05:39,758 --> 03:05:40,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2670
03:05:40,498 --> 03:05:42,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to some of the tweets that we got tonight.

2671
03:05:43,458 --> 03:05:47,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Redertainment sent us a tweet that we did touch on earlier in the show, but just to mention it again.

2672
03:05:48,160 --> 03:05:50,380
[SPEAKER_02]: The Read Only Memories Kickstarter got funded.

2673
03:05:50,460 --> 03:05:50,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

2674
03:05:51,220 --> 03:05:54,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed MidBoss Games even retweeted our tweet that we were going live tonight.

2675
03:05:54,901 --> 03:05:56,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're supporting us just like we supported.

2676
03:05:56,562 --> 03:05:57,322
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys rule!

2677
03:05:58,612 --> 03:05:59,433
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys rule.

2678
03:06:00,293 --> 03:06:01,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling the love.

2679
03:06:01,274 --> 03:06:02,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I am feeling the love.

2680
03:06:02,935 --> 03:06:05,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Just you wait for Gamer X 2.

2681
03:06:06,117 --> 03:06:07,758
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole lot of you are getting glomped.

2682
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:09,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, DarkSakura?

2683
03:06:10,520 --> 03:06:11,101
[SPEAKER_05]: If I get to go.

2684
03:06:11,121 --> 03:06:12,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you will.

2685
03:06:13,723 --> 03:06:14,503
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make it work out.

2686
03:06:15,164 --> 03:06:17,345
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Rob, you have to cosplay with me.

2687
03:06:17,846 --> 03:06:18,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

2688
03:06:19,487 --> 03:06:23,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if I lose 20 pounds, then I will cosplay with you.

2689
03:06:25,011 --> 03:06:25,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not gonna happen.

2690
03:06:25,971 --> 03:06:26,051
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2691
03:06:27,608 --> 03:06:28,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you!

2692
03:06:29,469 --> 03:06:30,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to go there.

2693
03:06:30,629 --> 03:06:30,769
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2694
03:06:31,230 --> 03:06:31,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

2695
03:06:31,470 --> 03:06:33,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery.

2696
03:06:33,671 --> 03:06:33,831
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2697
03:06:34,111 --> 03:06:34,631
[SPEAKER_05]: It can happen.

2698
03:06:34,991 --> 03:06:38,233
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would invite you to go to the gym with me.

2699
03:06:39,026 --> 03:07:07,698
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I go to the other gym I know you do but I can get you into my gym alright anyway we'll talk later about that meanwhile we got some tweets if my fat ass could lose 20 pounds you could do it easy no fat shaming we shouldn't fat shame but I can say I'm fat if I want to but I saw that video this week but anyway you know what I feel for health reasons I feel I know I can be better have a better body than the one I'm at you know what as long as you love you

2700
03:07:09,068 --> 03:07:35,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I can do I do love me but I know I can do better all right anyway um moving on awkward talk moving on uh we have some tweets SSU and Hunter Matt guy trollingly applies to a college football coaching job citing his years of Madden and NCAAF playing do you do you think that do you think that we would be eligible for a job at a gaming company just because we did this podcast

2701
03:07:37,344 --> 03:07:45,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I will actually, I will say, and I think I've talked about this on the show, I'm not going to tell you who, but twice I've applied for positions with gaming companies.

2702
03:07:46,133 --> 03:07:54,242
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them I actually was really close with and I decided to, because I would have had to relocate and I would have had to stop doing the show and everything else.

2703
03:07:54,702 --> 03:07:56,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided to not go forward with it.

2704
03:07:56,284 --> 03:07:59,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to tell you what it was, but you guys know I am a corporate teacher.

2705
03:08:00,087 --> 03:08:01,248
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I do during the day.

2706
03:08:01,428 --> 03:08:03,990
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a corporate teaching job with a video game company.

2707
03:08:04,090 --> 03:08:04,471
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

2708
03:08:04,531 --> 03:08:05,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would have been really cool.

2709
03:08:06,132 --> 03:08:12,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just the relocation kind of like I couldn't do it because of where they wanted me to go, you know, would have been tough.

2710
03:08:13,118 --> 03:08:37,160
[SPEAKER_02]: but um yeah so um but yeah I mean like you know but but does the fact that we do a podcast mean we should work for video game companies not necessarily yes well I mean if it's graphic design then that for you that's good yeah Loki does sales you know so you know maybe that type of stuff would be good for him I would love to do design for like digital manuals and that type of thing

2711
03:08:38,041 --> 03:08:41,024
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt says, I've cited OLR in a job interview once.

2712
03:08:41,164 --> 03:08:41,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't get the job.

2713
03:08:42,245 --> 03:08:42,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear it.

2714
03:08:44,807 --> 03:08:49,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used people for references, though, as people have listed Orange Lounge Radio as jobs.

2715
03:08:49,591 --> 03:08:50,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you do that, DarkSakura?

2716
03:08:50,672 --> 03:08:52,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You put OLR down and me as a professional contact?

2717
03:08:52,674 --> 03:08:54,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I put OLR down.

2718
03:08:54,335 --> 03:08:57,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you were already one of my references.

2719
03:08:57,758 --> 03:09:01,522
[SPEAKER_05]: But I put OLR down as a client for freelance design.

2720
03:09:02,202 --> 03:09:04,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And I put myself down as art director for VOG.

2721
03:09:04,244 --> 03:09:08,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I have used it as an example of management skills, doing this show and keeping you two in line.

2722
03:09:08,865 --> 03:09:10,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

2723
03:09:10,746 --> 03:09:12,306
[SPEAKER_02]: We all help each other out, to be honest.

2724
03:09:13,367 --> 03:09:14,467
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see.

2725
03:09:14,507 --> 03:09:16,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one other tweet here I wanted to read.

2726
03:09:16,548 --> 03:09:26,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was from Eric RPG sent us a tweet, and it was just a link over to a Kickstarter for Grapple Knight is another Kickstarter.

2727
03:09:26,790 --> 03:09:28,631
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming this is a Kickstarter he's behind.

2728
03:09:29,031 --> 03:09:30,152
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2729
03:09:49,103 --> 03:09:51,925
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get her back on the show for sure at some point.

2730
03:09:52,005 --> 03:09:54,987
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you remember our buddy?

2731
03:09:55,507 --> 03:10:00,090
[SPEAKER_02]: She came on the show right after it was announced she was going to be on the Tester 3.

2732
03:10:00,530 --> 03:10:02,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy Asuka was on the show.

2733
03:10:03,032 --> 03:10:05,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, funny enough, we didn't know this.

2734
03:10:05,233 --> 03:10:06,814
[SPEAKER_02]: She called in just out of the blue.

2735
03:10:06,834 --> 03:10:08,035
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't arrange the interview or anything.

2736
03:10:08,075 --> 03:10:09,536
[SPEAKER_02]: She knew a listener of the show.

2737
03:10:10,276 --> 03:10:11,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope Stan's still listening if he's out there.

2738
03:10:11,937 --> 03:10:13,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for hooking that up.

2739
03:10:13,498 --> 03:10:18,121
[SPEAKER_02]: But she called into the show one night and it happened to be the week before she got kicked off the Tester 3.

2740
03:10:18,601 --> 03:10:19,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, she was very cool.

2741
03:10:19,922 --> 03:10:20,562
[SPEAKER_02]: But she was very cool.

2742
03:10:20,582 --> 03:10:21,343
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of fun with her.

2743
03:10:21,363 --> 03:10:21,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, get this.

2744
03:10:22,864 --> 03:10:25,245
[SPEAKER_02]: She's on the King of the Nerds season two.

2745
03:10:26,326 --> 03:10:30,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, girl, I know you can't talk about if you won or lost the thing.

2746
03:10:30,509 --> 03:10:31,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

2747
03:10:31,209 --> 03:10:35,312
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, win or lose, you have been on the Tester and King of Nerds.

2748
03:10:35,592 --> 03:10:38,914
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the nerdiest reality show contestant of all time.

2749
03:10:41,522 --> 03:10:44,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I just thought that was hilarious that she's on that show now.

2750
03:10:44,464 --> 03:10:49,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have her back to talk about that, which sounds like Ranma saying, fuck King of the Nerds.

2751
03:10:49,228 --> 03:10:51,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he'll be really excited for that interview then.

2752
03:10:51,910 --> 03:10:54,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Redertainment says she's on actual TV.

2753
03:10:54,252 --> 03:10:54,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2754
03:10:55,754 --> 03:10:56,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy, huh?

2755
03:10:58,078 --> 03:10:59,761
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, let's see.

2756
03:10:59,901 --> 03:11:01,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Other stuff I wanted to mention.

2757
03:11:02,305 --> 03:11:11,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Peeker Uno tweeted the show and said, I missed last week's topic, but one of my favorite TV programs was Nightmare, a virtual reality RPG game show in the 90s.

2758
03:11:13,030 --> 03:11:14,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that kind of.

2759
03:11:14,451 --> 03:11:15,031
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

2760
03:11:16,072 --> 03:11:18,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I don't think we're getting any other calls.

2761
03:11:19,334 --> 03:11:19,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.

2762
03:11:19,854 --> 03:11:20,354
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL, bye.

2763
03:11:20,375 --> 03:11:22,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

2764
03:11:22,616 --> 03:11:23,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one last bit.

2765
03:11:24,457 --> 03:11:26,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, and then we'll close up shop for tonight.

2766
03:11:26,398 --> 03:11:27,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is pretty exciting.

2767
03:11:27,439 --> 03:11:28,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been actually waiting for this to happen.

2768
03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:34,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition has now added Steam Workshop support.

2769
03:11:34,043 --> 03:11:34,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

2770
03:11:34,723 --> 03:11:35,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And a level editor.

2771
03:11:36,204 --> 03:11:39,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, does it have multiplayer play yet online?

2772
03:11:39,325 --> 03:11:40,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming if it has the level.

2773
03:11:40,806 --> 03:11:42,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised it doesn't if it already.

2774
03:11:42,786 --> 03:11:44,147
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, yeah.

2775
03:11:44,187 --> 03:11:46,067
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a bombshell announcement I could use.

2776
03:11:46,087 --> 03:11:47,468
[SPEAKER_07]: 60 maps for download already.

2777
03:11:48,048 --> 03:11:50,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're adding their own rating system and mini forum.

2778
03:11:51,369 --> 03:11:56,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And the game's also 75% off until tomorrow, which means I'm going to have to buy it right now.

2779
03:11:56,508 --> 03:11:57,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I just realized something.

2780
03:11:58,089 --> 03:11:59,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to check Drunken Robot Pornography.

2781
03:12:00,269 --> 03:12:00,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

2782
03:12:00,469 --> 03:12:01,330
[SPEAKER_02]: To see if they've updated.

2783
03:12:01,690 --> 03:12:03,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, I've still been playing the alpha.

2784
03:12:03,370 --> 03:12:03,771
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2785
03:12:04,411 --> 03:12:06,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too with Audio Surf 2.

2786
03:12:06,952 --> 03:12:08,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been getting little updates here and there.

2787
03:12:08,232 --> 03:12:14,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I've got my Steam card so I can buy... Yeah, I think you're going to have to buy the game being it's only $2.49.

2788
03:12:15,835 --> 03:12:17,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it really?

2789
03:12:17,295 --> 03:12:17,575
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only $2.49.

2790
03:12:17,675 --> 03:12:19,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that's a good one.

2791
03:12:19,836 --> 03:12:20,236
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good one.

2792
03:12:20,256 --> 03:12:20,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2793
03:12:20,677 --> 03:12:22,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem 3D together, $3.74.

2794
03:12:22,877 --> 03:12:22,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2795
03:12:24,998 --> 03:12:25,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Tempting, tempting.

2796
03:12:25,618 --> 03:12:25,859
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2797
03:12:27,179 --> 03:12:29,020
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2798
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:30,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for listening to us.

2799
03:12:30,921 --> 03:12:33,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay in here for the whole show, the whole way through for us.

2800
03:12:33,943 --> 03:12:45,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we could entertain you during your day with our chatter about video games wherever you're listening to us, whether you're here live Sunday night just chilling with our show or if you're listening to us on your commute or at your workday on Monday.

2801
03:12:45,889 --> 03:12:48,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for taking the time out to listen to Orange Launch Radio and supporting the show.

2802
03:12:49,071 --> 03:12:50,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Support independent broadcasting.

2803
03:12:50,991 --> 03:12:54,852
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many hardworking people like us out there that do this just for the love of it.

2804
03:12:55,172 --> 03:12:57,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go forth and download lots of indie podcasts.

2805
03:12:58,253 --> 03:13:08,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, word of mouth is key to the success of this show because there's so many of these big corporate podcasts that have much money in their pockets that can buy the promotion and so forth.

2806
03:13:09,135 --> 03:13:09,856
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do that.

2807
03:13:09,896 --> 03:13:13,336
[SPEAKER_02]: So all we ask, if you enjoy the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

2808
03:13:13,656 --> 03:13:14,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread the word.

2809
03:13:15,017 --> 03:13:15,997
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not as cute as us.

2810
03:13:16,757 --> 03:13:17,238
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not.

2811
03:13:17,418 --> 03:13:17,698
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not.

2812
03:13:17,718 --> 03:13:18,158
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very pretty.

2813
03:13:18,178 --> 03:13:18,798
[SPEAKER_05]: We're super adorable.

2814

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys once again for checking out the show.

2818
03:13:27,644 --> 03:13:31,286
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wouldn't mind saying a nice word on iTunes reviews, that would be great.

2819
03:13:31,386 --> 03:13:34,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Stitcher reviews are hugely helpful too.

2820
03:13:34,648 --> 03:13:40,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I directly attribute the increase we've had in our exposure on Stitcher to those of you that are taking the time to write reviews.

2821
03:13:40,931 --> 03:13:41,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much.

2822

[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

03:14:10,389 --> 03:14:14,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't let me buy you a fractal on my Steam app, so I have to do it when I get home.

2832
03:14:15,490 --> 03:14:16,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, shucks.

2833
03:14:16,391 --> 03:14:17,571

2834
03:14:18,931 --> 03:14:20,731
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always... I love you more than Loki.

2835
03:14:20,751 --> 03:14:22,032
[SPEAKER_05]: He only spent $3 on you.

2836
03:14:22,052 --> 03:14:22,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent $7.

2837
03:14:22,272 --> 03:14:22,312

[SPEAKER_07]: I have to spend $3 on me?

2841
03:14:29,017 --> 03:14:31,419
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

[SPEAKER_05]: See?

2843
03:14:34,001 --> 03:14:35,662

2844
03:14:38,685 --> 03:14:42,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave us reviews that are nice and sweet because we're cute.

03:15:15,549 --> 03:15:21,916
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I'm just throwing it out there, I'm actually planning on doing a Let's Draw series.

2850
03:15:22,697 --> 03:15:23,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And what would that be?

2851
03:15:23,678 --> 03:15:24,379
[SPEAKER_02]: You just draw?

2852
03:15:25,300 --> 03:15:34,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, pretty much, I get votes for a character that someone wants to see me draw, and I will do one once a month and give it away as a freebie.

2853
03:15:35,094 --> 03:15:35,575
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fun.

03:15:36,877 --> 03:15:37,538
[SPEAKER_02]: A little community.

2856
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:39,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Gather round.

2857
03:15:39,221 --> 03:15:41,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of a let's play, it's a let's draw.

2858
03:15:41,765 --> 03:15:43,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't have to worry about people breathing on my shit.

2859
03:15:43,689 --> 03:15:46,994
[SPEAKER_02]: She's just like Bob Ross, but they're bitchy little clouds.

2860
03:15:49,901 --> 03:15:50,661
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2861
03:15:50,821 --> 03:15:51,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you know what?

03:15:52,382 --> 03:15:54,243
[SPEAKER_05]: That came up in my oil painting class last week.

2863
03:15:54,883 --> 03:15:56,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I can't be like Bob Ross.

2864
03:15:56,664 --> 03:15:58,325
[SPEAKER_05]: My clouds are a little angrier than his.

2865
03:15:58,785 --> 03:16:00,666
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, so are they fussy little clouds?

2866

03:16:01,587 --> 03:16:02,167
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fussy.

2868
03:16:02,787 --> 03:16:03,127
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2869
03:16:03,428 --> 03:16:06,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we hope you and your bitchy little clouds have a wonderful week.
