1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,200
We are nearly a week away from Christmas and there is plenty of cheer to go around.

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,920
Read Only Memories has hit its funding goal, SteamOS is here for system builders and hobbyists,

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,120
and large scale investments continue to roll in for the Oculus Rift.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,920
This and more on the slightly sickly episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,920
Jason is way too happy in that intro tonight.

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,920
Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:48,920
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this December the 15th of 2013, episode number 531 of our program.

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,920
My name is Rob Roberts, here to join you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,920
with my co-host, say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Hi.

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
How are you DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm okay.

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
You're okay?

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Been better.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
I think you and I are kind of in the same boat right now.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,920
We are recovering from the plague.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Yes, we both have been a bit plagueish this past weekend.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Although I don't think it's the same plague, or maybe it is, I don't know.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,920
But I don't think I gave you cooties.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,920
I wasn't very very sick, but I've just been tired and worn down.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Well, as I think one of the emails we'll get into later, there's like a vog plague going around.

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Because I think Jess from Understation Live has something that she gave to Alan.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Alan gave it to me, or maybe Alan gave it to Jess.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,920
I think I got it from Becky.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Or from Dan getting it at work.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,920
I think it's just in general the plague of living in Sacramento, California.

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,920
I think finally all that government nonsense is just making us all sick at the same time.

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Or it's the cold, because you know us Californians are freaking out about the fact it's in the upper 20s.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
I don't live in Alaska, people.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,920
I've been sitting here rolling my eyes for a solid month.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Because seriously, this isn't cold and it's not humid, so you don't get cold with wet wind.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Well, here's a funny piece of that puzzle.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Who's not here tonight in studio, although he's been joining us on and off for the past month.

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Not here tonight is Jason, our announcer.

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,920
He has the night off, and would you like to guess why he has the night off?

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
He has the plague.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
He has the plague!

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,920
And he's from Colorado, and they get like negative 11 billion degrees in parts of Colorado where he's from.

39
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,920
So I don't think we can blame the harsh upper 20s of California on that.

40
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,920
But I'm fairly certain that the whole reason why I haven't been as sick as everybody else has been is because I practically live at the gym now.

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Aren't you not supposed to work out when you're sick though? I thought that was like a big no-no.

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:59,920
No. I was reading lately that for people who spend regular, like at least two or three days at the gym a week, tend to have a stronger immune system.

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Huh.

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,920
So if anything, that would explain why I've only been sick for like a day.

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Yeah, but like Extrovert from Hoard House is a big old gym guy now, and he still gets sick a lot.

46
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Huh.

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Well, not a lot, but like as sick as often as I do.

48
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,920
I don't know, but I haven't gotten sick nearly as often as I used to before this became a regular thing, so.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Alright, well also say hello to Techmaster Loki is here tonight.

50
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Hello.

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
How you doing, Loki?

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm here.

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Well, you don't have the plague.

54
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
No, I don't have the plague.

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,920
But if people were following along with previous editions of the show, you had wisdom teeth surgery this week.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Yeah, that was fun.

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
But you're here.

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
So you made a quick recovery.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Yeah.

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
What day did you have your wisdom teeth out?

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Thursday.

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Thursday.

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
So you're here.

64
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
That is only like three days later.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
See, it's so different for different people.

66
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Like some people are better like the next day.

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Can I go right back to work?

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Some people are out for like two weeks.

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Yeah.

70
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Two weeks.

71
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Were you one of the ones that was out for like a frickin like two months or something?

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Insane for months.

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Oh my God.

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
What happened?

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
The holes never filled in on the bottom teeth.

76
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
So I basically had swelling and bruising for at least two of those months.

77
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
And then the pain.

78
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,920
I was on antibiotics for, I was on five different antibiotics.

79
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Was that pre-OLR though?

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Cause I don't remember that affecting the show.

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Show's been on too long.

82
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
All right.

83
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Sorry.

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Low keys.

85
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Around 2004.

86
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Oh, then I guess we would have had the show.

87
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Low keys moment.

88
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Sorry.

89
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
No, I saw the swelling.

90
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Um, and I can't really chew food.

91
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I mean, I can sort of chew food.

92
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Like I, I've been slowly getting into more solid stuff, you know, because before is smoothies

93
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
and soup and that's it.

94
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,920
So today I tried to do French fries from McDonald's and it sort of works.

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
It sort of works.

96
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
You're making it work, I guess.

97
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Um, and then, um, yeah, so I, I'm not like pain medication.

98
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm not really taking any unless, you know, sometimes during the night, just because it

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
makes the swell, the feeling of the swelling go down.

100
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Like right now, like today, I don't feel as swollen, but it feels like it's all swollen

101
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
on the inside.

102
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Like, cause sometimes like if I sleep on my side or something, I feel like I bite my cheek

103
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
or something.

104
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
So I kind of get that feeling right now.

105
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I already had one of the stitches come out.

106
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,920
So I was like, no, sitting there talking.

107
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,920
I was like, there's a string here and it's like, okay, let's not get too detailed.

108
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,920
We want people to keep listening for when we get to the video game talk.

109
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,920
But, uh, I'm glad to see you're doing much better.

110
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,920
It looks like you're just, you're one of those people that made a quick recovery.

111
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
So good for you.

112
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Apparently, uh, I metabolize, um, the, uh, anesthesia medicine really fast too.

113
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Yeah.

114
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I was going to say what happened to the, uh, Loki goes to the dentist or whatever video

115
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
that was going to be planned.

116
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
What happened?

117
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
I wasn't really out of it.

118
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,920
You know, I mean, I was a little like, um, tired and stuff like at first cause they,

119
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,920
they gave me Valium to take before I went there, which is good because like I have like

120
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,920
all sorts of unnecessary phobias about like all sorts of, you know, surgical could probably

121
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
haven't really done any of that stuff.

122
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,920
You know, I've never had any experience with like having surgery or being put under or,

123
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,920
um, you know, I don't really go to the doctor that often.

124
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,920
So, you know, I get a little nervous around needles and stuff.

125
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
I just don't like it.

126
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,920
And I know, I know that there's no real danger to it and it's just, you know, it still makes

127
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
me uneasy, but the Valium helped.

128
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,920
So they wouldn't let me stay awake and listen to them.

129
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Um, well the Valium, yeah, the Valium helped and then they, uh, you know, they were going

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,920
to put in the IV and I just, I just didn't want to watch that cause I was like, ah, no

131
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
thanks.

132
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
So I closed my eyes and they gave me the oxygen and that was the last thing I remember.

133
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,920
But then, um, they, I did feel them doing stuff, but not necessarily anything painful.

134
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
I just felt them doing stuff in my mouth.

135
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Like, I don't know, work.

136
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Oh, I'm so glad that shit knocks me the hell out.

137
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,920
And then, then, then I woke up and you know, um, you know, they're all trying to like to

138
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
help me out, you know, help me sit down.

139
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
I'm like, no, I'm not dizzy.

140
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
I can walk just fine.

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
You know, that's not a problem.

142
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
So we went out to the car.

143
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm like, I'm not really, I'm tired, but I'm not really dizzy or anything.

144
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
So yeah, unfortunately it wasn't loopy.

145
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Nellie said I said weird things, but all of those were intentional weird things.

146
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
You always say weird things.

147
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
I was making bad jokes and that she's like, well, you said this joke.

148
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm like, yeah, but I remember saying that and I meant that on purpose.

149
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,920
So, you know, that, that's not just me saying weird things.

150
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
All right.

151
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Let me go to the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

152
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,920
nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network,

153
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
vog network.com.

154
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,920
And if you are listening live on this Sunday night, come on down to the chat room,

155
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
live.vog network.com.

156
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,920
We often read comments from chat on the show because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

157
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,920
YYR starting us off tonight saying, come for the video game talk, stay for the gross medical drama.

158
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Yes.

159
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
It's like an episode of VR.

160
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
It wasn't that bad.

161
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Now, if I started talking about my hernia surgery that I had a few years ago.

162
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Can we not?

163
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Let's not.

164
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Yeah, that was not fun.

165
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
All right.

166
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Way worse than this.

167
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
I was awake through that.

168
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Uh, SSG 100 Matt saying don't have rice.

169
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
I would say popcorn either.

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Either way.

171
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Well, yeah, I know I'm not chewing anything or it's pretty much all liquid stuff right now.

172
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
I ate a lot of pudding.

173
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Stuff that I can eggs, you know, like I had eggs last night and those are dull.

174
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
They're like the best eggs ever.

175
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Because, you know, after having just smoothies and, you know, tomato bits.

176
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Do you like pudding?

177
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
No.

178
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,920
I was going to say, cause you can mix protein powder and my wife wanted me to have like,

179
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,920
she got, well, she meant to get rice pudding, but it ended up being tapioca.

180
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm like, no, uh, awesome.

181
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Unicorn is in our chat room saying, man, when I had all four wisdom teeth out, I agreed

182
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,920
to fill in for dinner theater the same night.

183
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
That's hardcore.

184
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Cause like having to sing, I would assume dinner theater means you sing.

185
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,920
And like I just saw that vibration would, Oh, no, that's not fun.

186
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,920
I must, that must've been some like non-impacted easy peasy teeth coming out there.

187
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Cause that's too much.

188
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
God, I was just thinking back to, I wanted to stay awake so I could watch.

189
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,920
I wanted them to put a mirror so I could watch, but they wouldn't let me, well, they wouldn't

190
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,920
let me watch my hand surgery either because it was too small, but they had to give me

191
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,920
laughing gas to make my, uh, uh, uh, my veins dilate so that they could get the IV in.

192
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,920
And that hand stayed bruised for like a week and a half.

193
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Uh, so we're comments from a chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

194
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Uh, Zebediah, the Messiah saying long time listener on iTunes first live show.

195
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Well, welcome.

196
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Welcome to the show.

197
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Yeah.

198
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
We've been getting some new listeners, listeners lately, just thanks to it.

199
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Well, I know he said he's a long time listener, but just thanks to, um, Stitcher.

200
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
He's awesome.

201
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Unicorn very well.

202
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Yeah.

203
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
I don't recognize the unicorn as well.

204
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Who I don't recognize redundant.

205
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I mean, all unicorns are pretty awesome.

206
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
The girl at Starbucks.

207
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,920
When I told her that I wanted a unicorn, when she asked if I wanted anything else, she drew

208
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
a unicorn farting rainbows on my cup.

209
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,920
I'm a little sticker that goes on my reusable cup.

210
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
I kept it.

211
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
It was great.

212
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
That's amazing.

213
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Uh, and then dark Tetsuya in chat says, I was wondering if there was going to be a show

214
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,920
or not hearing everyone's sick and then Loki having, having his wisdom teeth out.

215
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,920
He, he, he, well, we had to be here because otherwise Zebediah, the Messiah would not

216
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
have had a live show to listen to.

217
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
And honestly, I didn't know how it, I mean, I didn't know how everyone.

218
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
I didn't know how everyone was saying, Oh, you know, you're going to be out for a while.

219
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
And I, I didn't know.

220
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,920
And, and hopefully nothing, I mean, so far I think everything's healing just fine.

221
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Who knows?

222
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Like a week from now.

223
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
And you know, Oh, sorry.

224
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
That just didn't quite heal.

225
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Right.

226
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Infection.

227
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
LOL.

228
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
I'm taking, I'm taking antibiotics.

229
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Yeah.

230
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
So I'm good.

231
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
So they give you Keflex?

232
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Uh, no.

233
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Amoxicillin.

234
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,920
And, uh, then I have the, cause I can't swallow pills yet somehow.

235
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Thank goodness that that volume was really small because like I couldn't drink water

236
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
with it.

237
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Cause normally I just, I down a little water and salt and stuff.

238
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Draggy lounge radio, everybody.

239
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Hey, this is legal if you've been prescribed it.

240
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,920
But, uh, no, I have, uh, whatever.

241
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,920
It's like Tylenol with codeine or whatever, whatever that is.

242
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
They gave me Vicodin.

243
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,920
And then when those stopped working, they gave me horse pill Vicodin.

244
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Like the one that's pure, pure hydrocodone and no other crap.

245
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,920
I just, when I had my gallbladder out, I slept for like a week straight.

246
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
That's just what I did.

247
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,920
I let the, you know what I did the first time I left the house after gallbladder surgery,

248
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
do you know what I went to do?

249
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,920
I have a gallbladder surgery like two days before Halloween.

250
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Cause it was my ex's birthday.

251
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Hilarious.

252
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,920
But, um, the first time I left the house after that was to go vote against Prop 8.

253
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,920
That was the first time I left the house after my gallbladder surgery.

254
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
It was a very worthy cause.

255
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
And you didn't vote absentee.

256
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
No, I never vote absentee.

257
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm one of those people where I'm like, I think absentee for me, I realized tons of people vote absentee and that's cool.

258
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
At least you're voting.

259
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
For me, absentee takes the magic out of it.

260
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Like I like to go in the little booth, click the, I don't know.

261
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
There's just something about that whole process.

262
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
I don't like people.

263
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,920
So I vote, I take my absentee, well the voting place is actually, I could walk there in five minutes.

264
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,920
So I fill out my absentee ballot at home with the internet in front of me and then I go take it and drop it off.

265
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Oh, okay. That works.

266
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,920
So I've gone to the place, but I voted, but I voted in a very comfortable manner.

267
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
There you go. All right.

268
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Uh, anyhow, uh, before we get into argument weeks and the things we've been playing this week, uh, some other topics here at the top of the show.

269
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,920
I don't have a whole lot in regards to kickoff topics, but we are entering the holiday period.

270
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Um, although we here at OLR, as far as I know, we're going to be doing shows every Sunday.

271
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,920
We're not taking any time off for the holidays cause, um, everybody kind of lucks out this year with Christmas and New Year's being on what, Wednesdays?

272
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I think Christmas and New Year's are both on Wednesday this year.

273
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Like Sunday happens to be like the 29th and so, you know, whatever, we'll be here those days.

274
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Um, none of us are traveling anywhere major, so we will be here through the holidays.

275
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:57,920
But since, you know, we're starting to kind of ramp up toward that season, I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to have a lot of time off where I'm doing nothing for like a week and a half at least.

276
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Are you guys going to be catching up on any games or do you have any gaming plans through the holidays? Like a wish list of things you gotta get through in the next month?

277
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Well, um, I still have to beat Skullgirls with everybody, which I just started it last night and beat it with Parasoul.

278
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Well, not last night, but the other day.

279
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,920
And I do want to get at least up to a 35 and finish that stupid quest that I'm stuck on.

280
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
And that's in 14?

281
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
14, yeah.

282
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:29,920
But, um, I'm still trying to do the play a new game every week thing. So like this past one with Skullgirls, I'm going to start Deadpool next week.

283
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
So, there you go.

284
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
So that's my goal is just to do something different.

285
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Your one new game a week. I like that.

286
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,920
And then we might, they'll be going to Washington later, so.

287
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Oh, good luck.

288
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,920
Snowpocalypse.

289
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Get lots of pictures of the snow on the way up there.

290
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,920
I will say thank you very much, Loki, before the show.

291
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,920
I hope you don't mind me saying this on the air, but Loki gave some Christmas presents out before the show.

292
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
I got a Steam gift card from Loki, and I believe Dark Soccer got one as well.

293
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
I did.

294
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,920
So, I'm armed and ready for the winter sale.

295
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,920
That is, when does that start, Loki? The winter sale for Steam?

296
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Soon.

297
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,920
The winter sale was already done. Or is it the fall sale? I can't keep track of these sales.

298
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Well, there's going to be a Christmas, New Year's sale. There always is, right?

299
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,920
But they don't call it Christmas. They call it holiday sale, right?

300
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,920
I think what we just saw was the winter sale, and now there will be the Christmas sale.

301
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Ah, somebody in chat said a straight one.

302
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
The winter festival sale.

303
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Live.vlogger.com.

304
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
It was the fall sale that they had, remember, because it was fall-spring.

305
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Oh, yeah, it was fall-spring, because the thing was upside down, it said spring.

306
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
So, I think the winter sale is coming right up.

308
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Yay.

309
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Go ahead.

310
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
No, just saying yay.

311
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Oh, yay.

312
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Yay, sales.

313
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Loki, what about your projects? You love to start projects that you never finish.

314
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
How's that tablet going?

315
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Actually, because I was actually thinking about that the other day, because I got some more stuff for that.

316
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Originally, I was going to use, it's similar to how they did the cross-plane thing where they had individual circuit boards for each controller,

317
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,920
and it would have hooked up almost like a cartridge that you'd plug in.

318
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,920
So, I bought a Sonic 2 and Sonic & Knuckles Genesis thing.

319
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,920
I was going to rip the whole thing apart and use the connectors on there for that.

320
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,920
But, it's too damn small for what I want to do, and I'm going to need to add stuff to it later on.

321
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
So, I'm like, okay, that's not the way to go.

322
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:26,920
So, the way to go is actually buying this, it's like a USB thumb stick that you plug into your system.

323
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:34,920
I forget to call it now, but it basically allows you to use almost any controller on any system,

324
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:43,920
including a keyboard, mouse, on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PC, and it just works.

325
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
You can do that.

326
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,920
So, that simplifies wiring everything a lot more than it was before,

327
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,920
because now I don't have to worry about having to switch between multiple different systems.

328
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,920
I can just wire up one controller to it and then just run it through that,

329
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,920
and it would work on multiple systems instead of having to do all that stuff.

330
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,920
But, no, I'm still consciously working on all that stuff.

331
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,920
I just have to get the parts and figure out the feasibility and stuff to get it working.

332
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Mainly right now is I'm trying to figure out how to make the actual case for all of it,

333
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,920
because that's going to be difficult since I've never done vacuum forming before,

334
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,920
and I had to design the case.

335
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,920
But before that, I was kind of distracted by,

336
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
okay, how am I going to get this so that I can wire up different controllers,

337
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,920
configurations, and stuff to one system?

338
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Well, now I don't do that anymore, so that makes it a lot easier in the design process.

339
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
But I'm still going to make it eventually.

340
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,920
So, what's your plan while you, because I knew you probably had a little time off of work.

341
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
What's your plan during that?

342
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
I don't have any time off of work.

343
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Oh.

344
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
I mean, you know, like...

345
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
The days, but...

346
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Head of days, okay.

347
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,920
I mean, I will have time off of work a few weeks after that, but...

348
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Well, that's for the baby, so...

349
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Well, actually, right now, I've been kind of...

350
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,920
What do I want to play and stuff?

351
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Yeah, I had one game I wanted to really play,

352
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,920
and I was even so kindly after talking such shit about their DLC practices,

353
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,920
I still, despite all of that, supported them in their terrible DLC practices

354
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,920
by purchasing the Season Pass while it was on sale for Saints Row IV.

355
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,920
My reward for that was, fuck you, you're not...

356
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Your save isn't going to fucking work anymore, you fucker.

357
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,920
So that was my thanks.

358
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Thank you, Deep Silver Infelition, for wasting 40 fucking hours of my time,

359
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,920
you know, playing that game, and basically making my save completely useless.

360
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,920
And it's apparently a widespread problem, where not only is it not a save thing,

361
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,920
it's, like, people that bought the DLC, their game's just not fucking working anymore, so...

362
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Oh, that's so frustrating.

363
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
It's just... thanks a lot, you know?

364
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,920
I was like, you know what, I just want to play something stupid today,

365
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
I just want to play, you know, some Saints Row.

366
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,920
After losing 40 hours in a game, how would you have the motivation to play again?

367
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,920
I'm gonna cheat like a motherfucker, is how I would do that.

368
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,920
But, see, that's the thing that was like, I don't even want to grind through,

369
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,920
even cheating like crazy to make it super easy so I can just get through all of it fast.

370
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
I don't even want to do that.

371
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Why should I even put myself through the effort to, you know, play this game

372
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,920
when it's so obviously broken that I just... I can't... I can't do it.

373
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,920
And it's just, it's not gonna be worth it for these DLC missions, which, let me be honest,

374
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,920
they're probably about 30 minutes long each, if I'm lucky.

375
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,920
And so, I just don't know if I want to do it.

376
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Yeah, I would like to go back and do it, but I wish my save would work just fine,

377
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,920
because, I don't know, it was fun, and it's definitely not mods,

378
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,920
because I've uninstalled... I deleted the whole game off my computer,

379
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,920
redownloaded everything, no mods are in there, it still fucking doesn't work,

380
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,920
so it's just something with their game, and it's disappointing.

381
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Alright.

382
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,920
But, yeah, I don't know. I tried to figure something else to play.

383
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,920
For me, I kind of want to do the Jamie thing and try to do some new games,

384
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,920
although with Final Fantasy XIV getting a patch this week,

385
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm obviously gonna dump a lot of my time into that,

386
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
but I'm trying not to spend my entire vacation,

387
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,920
because my work actually shuts down between Christmas and New Year's,

388
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,920
like, we have to take the time off, so I have lots of time off to do very little,

389
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
because, you know, my family doesn't do an awful lot on holidays.

390
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
You can hang out with me.

391
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
You can absolutely hang out and do stuff.

392
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Go to Ikea every day.

393
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Every day. Well, things should hopefully slow down a couple days after Christmas,

394
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,920
which is the period that I've got all this time and nothing to do.

395
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
I might finally crack and get the PlayStation 4,

396
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
because the finances are looking pretty good now,

397
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
so this might be the time I finally do that.

398
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Well, you know, and I understand if you're still hesitant about picking up the PlayStation 4,

399
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
because there aren't a lot of games out there,

400
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,920
there is one game that's on current gen systems that would take up a good portion of your time.

401
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Let me guess, does it start with Grand and end with a 5?

402
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Yes, it does.

403
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Actually, I was looking to see if it was on sale at Target when I was there the other day.

404
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Amazon, $39.99.

405
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Is it? I might jump on that. I really might jump on that.

406
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,920
We just put out the level creator this week, so I got working on that a little bit.

407
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,920
By the way, you know what I saw 5 of at Target in Roseville last night?

408
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Xbox Ones.

409
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Yeah, I saw it. There were plenty at the ones here in ESAC, too.

410
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Dan's like, you want to get one? I'm like, no.

411
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
I'm kind of surprised.

412
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,920
I mean, you'll get one eventually.

413
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Maybe.

414
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
It does have Killer Instinct.

415
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Don't care.

416
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,920
I'm just saying, just saying.

417
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,920
It's just like, you know, there's not a lot I would play on it.

418
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Even the PlayStation 4, either of the systems, there's not a lot I would really do.

419
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,920
We have no reason to look at either right now.

420
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I really don't need a PlayStation 4 right now,

421
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,920
but knowing that after seeing the Final Fantasy XIV footage with the remote play,

422
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I'm like, oh, God, at least I know a date now.

423
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Exactly, exactly.

424
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,920
And, by the way, we just picked up Star Fox 3DS last night because we had coupons.

425
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
And Dan's all over that one.

426
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
So I was like, we've got plenty to play right now.

427
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
And Dan has a villager in Normandy.

428
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,920
You can go run by his tent now that Normandy is open.

429
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,920
The other big games I have to beat are Mario 3D World and Zelda Link Between Two Worlds

430
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,920
because I do love both those games a lot, probably in my best of the year, for sure.

431
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,920
I keep getting distracted with all these other games I'm trying to play, too,

432
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
so I definitely want to play those games and beat them.

433
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Probably inevitably during the winter sale, BioShock Infinite will be on sale,

434
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
and I can finally play and beat that, and then I'm hoping I can get...

435
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I think it's still on sale now. It's been, like, dirt cheap, like 10 bucks.

436
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
I bought mine ages ago for dirt cheap.

437
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm hoping I can get The Last of Us and Beyond Two Souls from the rental company

438
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,920
over the holidays as well. That would be fantastic.

439
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Or Zelda Wind Waker is on my list, too, because I've got to catch up with that.

440
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,920
We've actually got Ocarina for 3DS on our list. Dan and I do.

441
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Wow. All right. Go into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

442
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Awesome Unicorn says, Resogun made the PS4 purchase worth it for me.

443
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Yeah, that's one of the games I'm really eyeing. I definitely want to get that.

444
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Fifth Dream said PlayStation 4 is worth it for Doki Doki Universe right now.

445
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I don't know a lot about that game. I've heard of it.

446
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,920
YYR says, a friend who works at GameStop said today that PS4s were sold out in 10 minutes,

447
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,920
but Xbox Ones were in stock all day and didn't sell. He had no idea why.

448
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah, I'm hoping that if I do want to get a PlayStation 4, I can actually get one.

449
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
That would be really great.

450
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,920
Let's see. Raginator says, Skye, technically no one actually needs any games or system.

451
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,920
People need food, water, shelter, oxygen, etc. The question is, do you want the system?

452
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,920
You don't know my addiction, Raginator. I need it.

453
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Valid smartass point that I would have made.

454
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Intervention.

455
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Anyhow, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week.

456
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Not what we're looking forward to, but the things we've actually had our hands on this week.

457
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,920
I know I've had a few. I don't know about you guys.

458
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Dark Sakura, starting us off.

459
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now.

460
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Yes you are. Why are you lying to the listeners? Don't lie to the listeners.

461
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Normandy's open. Everybody come hang out.

462
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,920
I've been playing Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds.

463
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Your hubby made a house in Normandy, right?

464
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,920
I made him a house in Normandy and he said he would play.

465
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,920
So I just got him started off and picked one.

466
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
So he has a shack.

467
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Because I am the mayor. No, he has a tent.

468
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Because you start off with a tent.

469
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Because I am the mayor, I decided where his house was going to be because city planning.

470
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
And I gave him the rules.

471
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Do not walk on the grass. You can walk on the path.

472
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
First thing he does is run through my lilies.

473
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Fucker. I love him.

474
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
So yeah, I'm also playing-

475
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
I love that asshole.

476
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
I'm also playing Zelda.

477
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
I...

478
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
What else did I play?

479
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Oh yeah, I played Skullgirls, which I really like.

480
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
And finally got to-

481
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,920
For some reason it doesn't work very well with the Capcom fighting controller.

482
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,920
But it works just fine with the regular Xbox 360 controller.

483
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
So that's what I'm using.

484
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,920
I loaded the Shiva and then I stopped playing it.

485
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I've probably done five more playthroughs of the Stanley parable.

486
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
And I got the Portal ending.

487
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Did you get that yet?

488
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Oh, Rob just shook his head.

489
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Yeah, basically, if you keep going through the wrong door-

490
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Stanley parable is on my holiday list.

491
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Because I own it. I bought it on the sale, but I haven't played it yet.

492
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Okay. Well, just remember that going through the wrong door is an option.

493
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Because I don't want to ruin it for you.

494
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
But I got dumped into Portal.

495
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
So that was pretty funny.

496
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
Oh, sorry.

497
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,920
What else did I play? Because I played other stuff too.

498
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
I tried to play more Bust-A-Move Universe.

499
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
It really is not very good.

500
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
I want to like it so much.

501
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Because playing it on my phone is freaking awesome.

502
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,920
But playing it on the 3DS is not awesome.

503
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
It's nawesome.

504
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Oh yeah, I've been playing a lot of Bejeweled on my phone.

505
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Because that's my I-really-need-to-get-sleepy game.

506
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,920
And I like the music in that game. I can't help it.

507
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,920
It does kind of have New Agey, Philip Glass type of soundtrack to it.

508
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Oh, I love Philip Glass. But the one on the phone?

509
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,920
It's like this epic type music.

510
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
It's kind of almost like...

511
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Like whenever you see Ancient Mesopotamia, that type of music.

512
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Like you're watching Ben-Hur or something.

513
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Epic movie trailer of epicness?

514
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Epic. It's epic.

515
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,920
And then I played more of...

516
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Fractal.

517
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Do you have Fractal?

518
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
No.

519
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Fractal? And you're going to live with it.

520
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Sweet.

521
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Fractal is a great game.

522
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Free games rule.

523
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
So I'm ruining one of your presents.

524
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Do you have Fractal yet? You need to play Fractal.

525
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Fractal? I probably do.

526
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Fractal is like the best puzzle game in the universe.

527
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
It makes me super happy.

528
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
By the way, for anyone who just showed up, Normandy is open.

529
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Okay, that's probably about it.

530
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I didn't play any Final Fantasy this week. I played last week.

531
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Which is how I got harassed for my name.

532
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,920
And everybody go on the VOG website and read my article.

533
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Alright. There you go.

534
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Loki, how was your gaming week?

535
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
I played Grand Theft Auto Online.

536
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:52,920
I ended up in a lobby with a modder or hacker or whatever you want to call them.

537
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,920
Whatever the case may be. I ended up level 40 and I have 13 million dollars now.

538
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
So that ain't bad.

539
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,920
And then I messed around with the content creator a little bit.

540
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,920
And tried to make a race and it turned out okay.

541
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
I guess you can stack objects.

542
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,920
There's like a trick where you can stack objects and make them float in the air.

543
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Which is kind of what I wanted it to do in the first place.

544
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
But they made it so damn difficult to do that.

545
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,920
So I just kind of, you know, didn't mess with that part too much.

546
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
But there's some pretty neat stuff out there.

547
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Unfortunately the one track that someone used as an example, like a floating racetrack, really sucked.

548
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
But I did play it.

549
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
There's some other ones.

550
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,920
It was where you're jumping over overpasses with cars with giant ramps.

551
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
That was kind of fun.

552
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,920
But I like the way it integrates in your game and stuff.

553
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,920
You see the waypoints on there but they're orange instead of blue.

554
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:54,920
And you can go on Social Club and basically bookmark any stuff that you like on there.

555
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,920
And it will show up in your game and you can play it and do all sorts of fun stuff.

556
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,920
So right now they have just the race and deathmatch creator.

557
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,920
But I guess more stuff is coming out later on.

558
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,920
And then what else did they play this week?

559
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Oh! Some other strange stuff for a little unusual I guess for me.

560
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,920
So we were bored and I was trying to occupy Josh.

561
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,920
So I tried to get him to play Wii Sports.

562
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,920
That didn't work because he didn't want to play it and he wanted to watch me play it.

563
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
So I showed him bullying.

564
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
So I played a little Wii Sports this week.

565
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,920
And also played a little bit of Rabbids Go Home.

566
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,920
He thought that game was a little bit funnier because the Rabbids are being stupid and gathering trash.

567
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
He still didn't understand.

568
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Those games are kind of made for kids too.

569
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Yeah, exactly.

570
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,920
He didn't understand why the rabbit was screaming at people and their clothes were falling off and they were collecting clothes.

571
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,920
And he was worrying that their shopping cart was going to tip over because it was stacked really tall with all sorts of weird things.

572
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
So that was kind of funny.

573
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,920
He's like, you've got to be careful. Don't turn so fast.

574
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
So that was kind of funny.

575
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,920
And then what else did they play?

576
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,920
I think I played a little bit of Just Cause Multiplayer just getting in the last little bit of their beta.

577
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,920
That should be launching actually tomorrow.

578
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
So I'm looking forward to that.

579
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
I'll be coming out on Steam.

580
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Worthwhile investment if I see so myself.

581
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,920
And then what else did I play?

582
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,920
A little Call of Duty I guess at work.

583
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
There's nothing really else to play there.

584
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,920
And that's pretty much it for right now.

585
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,920
But hopefully we'll get into some Saints Row.

586
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,920
I don't know if I want to go back.

587
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,920
It's sad.

588
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
You're just frustrated.

589
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,920
No seriously, it's sad.

590
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Games like Saints Row 2 and stuff, I really like going back into those and playing them again and stuff.

591
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,920
But it's just the last couple of games they put out.

592
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Like even Saints Row the Third, I think I played through that at least two or three times.

593
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
I just don't want to do it again.

594
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,920
I don't want to go through all the hassle because it's like, I've already seen that joke.

595
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
It's funny.

596
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:19,920
Maybe, maybe if a certain other host that was on this network would pick up a copy.

597
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,920
Then it might be worth it since I have to start from the beginning.

598
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,920
We could go through together and play through a co-op campaign.

599
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Then I can also get those extra achievements I don't have yet.

600
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Alright Travis Donovan, I hope you're listening.

601
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Or Bobby.

602
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Okay, my gaming week. I actually played a lot of random shit this week.

603
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
I powered on my 360.

604
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
I've never heard of a lot of random shit, Rob.

605
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
It's a new game. It's by Random Shit Co.

606
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,920
So I powered on my 360 this week, which is like the first time in like four months.

607
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
I turned it on and it had to do a...

608
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:59,920
I seriously think the last time I played my 360 was when the Mass Effect DLC came out.

609
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
Sure it wasn't Forza Horizon.

610
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Maybe one of those. No, because the DLC was after the Forza Horizon stuff.

611
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,920
That was like, Forza Horizon-a-thon was back in like January, February.

612
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
And then what? When was the Citadel DLC out?

613
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
That was out over summer, right?

614
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Yeah, I think so.

615
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
That was probably one of the last times.

616
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I maybe turned it on once after that for Mass Effect multiplayer, but that was really it.

617
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,920
So I turned on my 360. It had to do a dashboard update.

618
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,920
What did they change? I didn't notice anything was different at all.

619
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
Jack shit.

620
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,920
I'm assuming the integration with Xbox One or something.

621
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
I don't remember.

622
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,920
Do your friends list expand on 360 now too? Because Xbox supports a thousand friends?

623
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,920
No, because all I see... I don't see what you're playing on Xbox One.

624
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,920
All I see is that you're on Xbox One. I don't see what they're doing.

625
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Which is kind of weird because you could do that on PC.

626
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
I remember you used to see what people were playing on PC.

627
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
But no, they don't have that integrated there.

628
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
So no, I don't have more than 100 people.

629
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Weird.

630
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,920
Well, I have 99 friends right now, so find my username if you want to be the 100th person.

631
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,920
You have 99 friends, but so-and-so ain't one.

632
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Yeah, somebody dropped me this week. I don't know who because it won't tell me.

633
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
And BlackWolf confirms, no it doesn't.

634
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Well, that sucks. I was hoping for that expansion, but oh well.

635
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,920
I admittedly haven't played a lot of 360.

636
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,920
I'm not being a hater. It's just nothing new I've really bought on 360 lately.

637
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,920
But I went back and visited some of my classics because I have a shit ton of downloads.

638
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Especially from Xbox Live Arcade when Xbox first came out.

639
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
There's all that free stuff still, although...

640
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Yeah, I've been checking some of that out.

641
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,920
But I went back and I played Gyruss, I played Tempest, I played Time Pilot.

642
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,920
I played all those old arcade games that were available.

643
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,920
Somehow I didn't play Game Room. I'm surprised I didn't.

644
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
But you know I love my classic games.

645
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Played some...

646
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
And they love you.

647
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
As they should.

648
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Played Spelunky, which came out on PlayStation.

649
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,920
It's been out on PlayStation Network. It came out on sale big time this week for like $375.

650
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,920
So even though I owned it on PC, I loved it well enough that I bought it again on PlayStation Network.

651
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
And I don't regret that decision because it's cross-play.

652
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,920
So I got it on PlayStation Network and my Vita.

653
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,920
So like anywhere in my life now I can have Spelunky.

654
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
Hold on, I'm gonna sneeze. Help.

655
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Blessings be upon you for the mucus coming from your nose.

656
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,920
That was weird. It was one of those like, you're gonna sneeze, you're gonna sneeze. Just kidding.

657
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Oh no!

658
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Radio host's worst enemy. Sorry about that. And it's live. Nothing I can do about it.

659
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,920
No, imagine being in customer service and having that happen when you're trying to...

660
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Oh, I'm sure. I was in customer service for seven years.

661
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,920
No, no, no. When you're trying to explain one's mortgage interest to them while they're yelling at you.

662
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,920
You see where this spot is right here. That's where...

663
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Anyway, let's see. So I was playing Spelunky on now PlayStation Network.

664
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Which, you know, literally it is the exact same game as it is on PCs. There's not a lot I can report on.

665
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,920
I did play it on Vita. It looks great, although it's so tiny and it's hard to read things.

666
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,920
But it worked well enough, so I'm cool with that.

667
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:05,920
And then I played one other game. And this game, I know I'm gonna get shit for my opinion.

668
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Because I didn't really get it. And I have a lot of friends that are really, really into this game.

669
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,920
But I'm gonna be completely honest. I loved the presentation of this game.

670
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,920
I loved the way things looked, and I was really cracking up.

671
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:27,920
But when it came down to the game itself, I just really didn't have a lot of fun with the Wonderful 101 on Wii U.

672
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,920
And I know I'm gonna get crap for that, but it is what it is.

673
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,920
When I first started playing it, I was like, oh, this game is really funny.

674
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,920
And you kind of expect that from Platinum Games. Bayonetta was over-the-top hilariousness.

675
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,920
And there's a lot of that stuff in Wonderful 101 as well, so I was really into it.

676
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,920
But then when I actually played the game, I was kind of really getting frustrated with stuff.

677
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,920
So the gist of it is that you control an entire group of people.

678
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
And you pick up more people as you're running along.

679
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,920
And those people can be in different patterns.

680
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,920
They can be in a circle to turn your main guy into having a giant punching glove type of thing.

681
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Or it can be a straight line for a sword.

682
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,920
And then at some point, when your group gets big enough, you can kind of have both going on at once.

683
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,920
And then you also draw lines to get from place to place.

684
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,920
But I was having a lot of problems with camera angles and not being able to see some places I wanted to go.

685
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,920
And there was this one part of the game where everybody gets under a giant football helmet.

686
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Well, that football helmet was taking up the entirety of the screen. I couldn't even see where I was going.

687
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
So I had no idea what was going on.

688
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,920
So weird little quirks like that were just weird to me.

689
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,920
And again, trying to find some things I was supposed to be doing, it wasn't very intuitive.

690
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,920
And I guess the game is supposed to be very challenging, which I can respect it for that.

691
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,920
But it was a lot of slash slash like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game with this interesting mechanic.

692
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
So mash and slash and hope you get it right?

693
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Yeah, kinda. That's what I felt when I was playing the game.

694
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,920
And so I feel kind of bad for razzing it because again, it had a great setup.

695
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,920
And everything was in this really cool package and the presentation was awesome and it looked great.

696
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,920
But yeah, the game itself, I just didn't really have fun with it.

697
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,920
So I don't know. I feel like this is one of those games that if I revisited it a month or two, maybe I'll enjoy it again.

698
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,920
But I didn't really care for it.

699
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Well, you're entitled to your opinion.

700
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,920
I am. I am. And I know I'm going to get emails telling me I'm wrong.

701
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,920
Whatever. I thought it was Pikmin.

702
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
I mean, I don't know.

703
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,920
Not really.

704
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Beautiful Pikmin.

705
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,920
No. No, it's not.

706
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,920
All right. So that was really it for my gaming week.

707
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,920
So I might try to get into that game like one more time.

708
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Keep in mind, that was the game I played when I was sick.

709
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,920
So that could have been like kind of. But I'll try it one more time after I feel better.

710
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,920
And if I still don't care for it, I'm probably going to send that one on back and get something else.

711
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,920
But anyway, that's really it for my gaming week.

712
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,920
So anybody else?

713
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
Pizza.

714
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
Pizza. Pizza. You bringing me pizza?

715
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
No.

716
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,920
All right. Let's see. Some quick housekeeping.

717
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,920
By the way, you better bring out your DS so that I can get the last piece of the puzzle I need for the Rhythm Heaven puzzle.

718
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Your thing has a street pass with me yet?

719
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
No.

720
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Should have. Weird.

721
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
No.

722
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,920
Okay. So don't forget to follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

723
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,920
And we're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and Google Plus.

724
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Google.com slash plus Orange Launch Radio.

725
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,920
And as far as shows off over the next few weeks, we don't have any planned.

726
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,920
We will be here Sundays through the holidays.

727
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,920
So thank you for tuning in and being here for those shows.

728
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
A couple other quick things I should mention.

729
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,920
I haven't given this enough coverage on the show.

730
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,920
But I do want to make sure you guys know that over at vognetwork.com, there are monthly raffles we're doing now.

731
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,920
And every time you get a point on the site, you get an entry into the raffle.

732
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,920
But you do have to opt into the raffle. You're not just entered by default.

733
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,920
So you actually need to go to vognetwork.com, click on raffles, and actually enter the raffle.

734
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,920
This month, we are giving away a $20 gift card to an online source of your choice.

735
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,920
Meaning, I think the options are Xbox, Playstation, Steam, Wii U, and regular Wii.

736
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Because those are still separate.

737
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,920
And then I know iTunes is in there too for people who don't even have any gaming consoles whatsoever.

738
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Google Play probably.

739
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,920
I don't think Google Play was one of the options, but it probably should be.

740
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,920
I'm pretty sure if you came in and said, I really don't want any of those, I want Google Play.

741
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
I'm pretty sure we can make that happen for you.

742
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,920
So that is over at vognetwork.com slash raffle.

743
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
So check that out.

744
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,920
And you can either check in live, and you get five points just for listening to the show.

745
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,920
Or if you're listening on the podcast feed, there's a passphrase hidden somewhere in the show.

746
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
And you've probably heard it before.

747
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Jason interrupts the show at some point and says, to register participation for this week's episode.

748
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
And then he gives you a little passphrase.

749
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,920
You go to vognetwork.com, you type that in the front page, and you will get your points.

750
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,920
But make sure you opt into the raffle if you want to win your $20 card that's not Google Play.

751
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
Just kidding, yeah.

752
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
Is Bobby in chat?

753
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,920
Bobby, can they have Google Play?

754
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,920
If they really want that more than anything, can they have Google Play?

755
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
I'll need to hear back from Bobby.

756
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,920
Vogmaster Bobby in just a minute here.

757
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Other thing I want to promote.

758
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,920
It's award season for things that you like, movies and so forth.

759
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,920
And podcasts are no different.

760
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Sadly, we didn't get nominated for the podcast awards, although I appreciate those of you guys that tried.

761
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
I know many of you were trying.

762
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
We didn't get nominated, sorry.

763
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
No, we did not get nominated for the podcast awards.

764
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Lots of indie shows did, though, so I can't be mad.

765
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,920
And I have a pretty good feeling I know which one of them is going to win.

766
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,920
And if they do win it, they totally deserve it.

767
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,920
But I won't say, because I don't want to make a booby of myself.

768
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,920
But podcast awards, unfortunately, we're not there.

769
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,920
But we do have a chance to do the Stitcher Awards are going on right now.

770
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,920
And I love Stitcher, because Apple's podcast app right now, not so great.

771
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,920
But Stitcher is available not only on the iPhone platform, but on Android as well.

772
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,920
And it's a great way to listen to podcasts, because you can actually stream them.

773
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,920
So you don't have to download them all to your device, which is what turns a lot of people off from podcasting in the first place.

774
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,920
So Stitcher lets you stream them, which is great.

775
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:37,920
So check that out, Stitcher. We are actually eligible to be nominated and would appreciate your consideration in Best Game and Hobby Show.

776
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,920
I know some of the other VOG Network shows, like Bobby's going for games and hobbies as well.

777
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,920
So a lot of our listeners are kind of voting for us one day and voting for him another day, which is cool.

778
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Understation Live, I think, is making a push for Most Original, which I can't think of a better title for that, for what they do over there.

779
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
I think that would be awesome if they got that.

780
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,920
So check that out again. That's part of Stitcher Radio at Stitcher.com, and we would appreciate your consideration during awards season.

781
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Just, you know, the exposure helps grow our family.

782
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,920
As I say at the end of every show, we don't ask for your money. We don't ask for anything. Just help spread the word about Orchards Radio.

783
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Just your soul.

784
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Yeah, just your eternal soul.

785
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,920
All right, let's get into gaming news, though. That's what you really came here for.

786
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,920
You didn't come here to hear me promo all this stuff. You want to hear about gaming news and us riffing on it.

787
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:32,920
So, uh, Loki. Oh, wait, wait. Do we have a... Okay, BlackWolf has the determination. He was like, do Google Play cards exist?

788
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
They do.

789
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Yeah, they do. I know I've seen them, too. And BlackWolf says, then I guess they can has.

790
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,920
So you heard it here first. Add it into the raffle this month. Google Play if you want. If you want.

791
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,920
All right. Now let's get into gaming news. Loki.

792
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:58,920
Ah, yes. So this week, everybody was up in arms because Content ID started going crazy. It became self-aware.

793
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Now, it started flagging a ton of videos, even more so than normal.

794
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:18,920
And this is mainly because they opened it up from just, you know, non affiliated users.

795
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:26,920
And now they're also going after affiliated ones. And it just kind of went to illustrate how ridiculous this thing is.

796
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:34,920
It's, you know. First off, OK, YouTube made a comment on it, you know, and basically said, you know,

797
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,920
nothing illustrates the incredible growth and evolution of YouTube better than the enterprise class.

798
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,920
OK, this is all PR speak, by the way. You know, I just want to interrupt that.

799
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,920
As these networks grow, we will make we are making products and blah, blah, blah, blah.

800
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,920
See, here is part of our commitment to ensure that all enterprise partners can continue to thrive and be successful on YouTube.

801
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,920
OK, that's a whole bunch of bullshit. Basically, they said that, yes, those Content ID things that went out were not a mistake.

802
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:10,920
They are real. So there. And a lot of the problem is, you know, these videos, you know, for those not aware of the Content ID service,

803
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,920
you know, I'm sure you'll probably hear from anybody that you follow on YouTube or, you know, a ton of people, you know,

804
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,920
especially in the blogs recently, it's basically this way of automating the process of finding, you know,

805
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,920
videos out there that inflict or that have copyrighted material within them.

806
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,920
And so way it works is they have a 30 second sample or, you know, sample their song.

807
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:44,920
I think it's like the first 30 seconds and or video and can be submitted to the service and basically checks the waveforms

808
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,920
or whatever to see if they match this ID. I think of it like an MD5 tag or something like that.

809
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,920
It checks to make sure that, you know, this is what this is.

810
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:59,920
And then some of our just to give some perspective, some of our videos on the Orange Lounge Radio YouTube account have been flagged like old videos,

811
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:07,920
like things I don't really care about that were us playing DDR at E3 and like the song that's being played in DDR content matches.

812
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,920
So even though we're filming off it because, you know, E3 is loud and has that background noise.

813
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,920
And even though we're filming off the TV, it's still content matches, which, you know, whatever, like I really don't care.

814
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,920
I mean, to be fair, we were showing video of someone else's game, not trying to really monetize that or whatever,

815
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,920
but it's just kind of one of those eye roll things, you know?

816
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:34,920
Yeah. And the other thing, well, like I said, it's automated because before this content ID, you know, thing existed,

817
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:44,920
it would be up to the content holders, you know, like Warner Brothers or whoever, you know, to actually go and find those videos and flag them manually.

818
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,920
It was a very manual process and they bitched him on it saying, oh, look at all the stuff's getting, you know, copyrighted.

819
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,920
There's full episodes of shows and stuff on YouTube and this thing needs to be taken care of or else we're going to sue you.

820
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,920
And so that's where they came up with this content ID thing. And now it's being, you know, everyone's getting flagged.

821
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,920
The problem is, though, it's automated. It's not necessarily done by these, you know, companies.

822
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,920
So, for example, say, you know, Capcom or something like that.

823
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:19,920
Sure, they probably have their materials in there because they don't want someone infringing upon that stuff, but they may be OK with you putting that stuff in there.

824
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Which Capcom is.

825
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Yeah, which they are. And so there's still, you know, you have to go through the whole process of, you know, basically contesting it.

826
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:42,920
And then, you know, it gets sent to the Capcom or their legal team and they have to either say, you know, yes, we agree this is an error or no, this, you know, really is infringing and stuff.

827
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,920
And it can lead to, you know, copyright flags and, you know, a copyright strikes, three strikes.

828
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:57,920
And of course, you're you're gone. Your videos are gone. And, you know, you're not going to be using that YouTube account anymore to make money.

829
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,920
So it's just it's really annoying. And like I know, like personally, I've had to deal with some of this stuff.

830
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Like I had a video that I made that was just some tutorial for Grand Theft Auto map editing and stuff.

831
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,920
And I didn't have any music in the background, but there's no audio there.

832
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,920
So, you know, YouTube said like, hey, here's some pre-approved tracks that you can use.

833
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,920
And so using their own service, I picked one of those tracks, got flagged from from that.

834
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:31,920
I'm like, dude, what the hell? I'm like, this is your this is music you said I can use in my video.

835
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,920
You know, and and now you're saying that, nope, sorry.

836
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,920
So I just removed the audio from that because obviously that wasn't the important part of it.

837
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,920
But it's just it's so ridiculous, you know, how how they've gone about it.

838
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:50,920
And, you know, there's stuff that, you know, people that don't even own the copyrights to, you know, are claiming like, as Bobby mentioned,

839
00:46:50,920 --> 00:47:00,920
you know, four gamer movie is targeting stuff for Metro last night because they put one of their I guess let's play videos or something through this.

840
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Somehow they were able to submit that as their own.

841
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,920
That I have a huge this is really irritates the piss out of me that what's going on with that,

842
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:15,920
where other people are putting in their content ID and it's not even stuff that they really own like that.

843
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,920
You that's what needs to be come down hard on these companies.

844
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:25,920
I said hard on these companies that put in these these content claims for things they don't really own that.

845
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,920
That needs to stop. And YouTube needs to come down hard and fast on that.

846
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:37,920
They won't. And that's that's going to be this is going to be a very interesting turning point because you've got a lot of very angry people about this,

847
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,920
because, you know, there's people that make their living off of YouTube videos.

848
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,920
And, you know, as much as you might want to say, get a real job or things like that, video editing is a bitch.

849
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,920
There's a reason I don't really like to put O.L.R. on video.

850
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:59,920
And I'm very thankful to our own VX Jason XV because he's the sucker that signed up and said, sure, I'll edit the videos to put it up on YouTube or whatever.

851
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,920
So prop. Thank you, Jason, because I ain't nobody got time for that.

852
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,920
As far as I'm concerned, I got other things I want to do.

853
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,920
It's such a pain at a video. So these people that do edit video, do work on it.

854
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:18,920
You know what? If you're going to watch it, I think the author can make like a tenth of a cent or whatever they get from the ad that shows in the beginning.

855
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:28,920
A lot of the people who have been making their money that way, like Classic Game Room, I think the Cinemassacre stuff, they've already left YouTube for other places.

856
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,920
And SF Debris, I think, went to Vimeo or this other one.

857
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,920
I don't think Vimeo allows gaming content.

858
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,920
No, not gaming. It's not for gaming. It was the guy who does the Star Trek and Doctor Who reviews.

859
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Oh, probably.

860
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,920
I think he went to Vimeo or he went to one other one, but he's been off of YouTube for a while now.

861
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:54,920
It is. It's not good, though, because I mean, yeah, we're talking about the gaming portion of it, but I'm sure that not just gaming is affected by it.

862
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,920
Like a ton of people are affected by it, you know, especially just all sorts of content producers. And that's not good.

863
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,920
I mean, it's not sending him a good message. It's basically saying you're and it's bad enough that once they do, you know,

864
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,920
content ID you, whatever, they flag your video, you're not making revenue on that video anymore.

865
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,920
The person who ever flagged it, they just assume that whatever, they're making money off of it.

866
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:24,920
Like Nintendo does that. They're so generous and they, you know, they allow you to keep your video up so that they can make money off of it.

867
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,920
I mean, it's just ridiculous.

868
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,920
I monetize the videos on my channel, Rob Roberts Plays. I sign up for the monetization and whatever, you know,

869
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:38,920
and I realize it's kind of shaky ground with copyright because I am playing people, other people's games, but it's, they're old games.

870
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,920
I like to think I'm kind of educating and bringing light to it, whatever, but I really...

871
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,920
The amount of money, trust me, the amount of money is ridiculous.

872
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,920
That's the thing is I also don't have any disillusions that I'm going to make a shit ton of money off this and quit my job.

873
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,920
No, that's not going to happen and I'm totally fine with that.

874
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:02,920
But it's the kind of thing where I'm like, hey, if maybe one of the videos are to end up going viral and I can get money to like afford a new microphone, then great.

875
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,920
You know, we do spend money out of our own pockets to do this show and, and vog and all that.

876
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,920
Like I, if I told you how much I spend on my own money on this shit, you'd probably be surprised.

877
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,920
That's okay. I'm not trying to yell at anybody. That's my hobby.

878
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,920
A lot of people spend money on their hobbies.

879
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,920
Like if your hobby is a remote control car racing, you probably drop a lot of money into that.

880
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,920
Yes, Dan does.

881
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,920
Right. So that's what I'm saying. This is my hobby. I drop money into it. That's fine.

882
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,920
Same with pinball.

883
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,920
If I can recoup a little bit of that, then great. But you know, I realized too with the Let's Plays is a slippery slope.

884
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:39,920
I recently did a Let's Remember video for the Legend of Zelda on NES and you know that shit got flagged and I was just kind of one of those.

885
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,920
I just rolled my eyes and like, whatever, whatever. Fine. I don't care. Oh no. 30 cents lost. What am I going to do?

886
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:53,920
Well, one thing Bobby just linked in chat about Jonathan Blow being flagged for posting his own game.

887
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,920
Ooh, see that's really not good. That shows a real problem with the content ID matching system though.

888
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,920
And Game Guru pointed out that it was SF Debris went to Blip. I knew it was one of those other ones.

889
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,920
Those comments from live.vognetwork.com.

890
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,920
SHO 100 Matt saying there is going to be and should be a great exodus from YouTube.

891
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,920
People are going to start getting fed up with their flagging content policies.

892
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,920
If many of the big time YouTube channels started leaving, people will follow.

893
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Let's be honest, YouTube is not a particularly difficult to steal technology.

894
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,920
I mean, there's tons of other companies that do the whole video embedding thing.

895
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,920
So it just kind of takes somebody stepping up and saying, yes, we welcome the gaming content.

896
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,920
A lot of people assuming that Twitch would jump on that real quick.

897
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,920
I mean, it would make sense because they already have ways that you can highlight and create like a video on demand thing.

898
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,920
They just don't have a way where you can upload your own videos that I know of.

899
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,920
Maybe you can and I just haven't really looked at that.

900
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:55,920
But needless to say, the focus on Twitch TV certainly isn't video on demand, but this is a huge opportunity for them.

901
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,920
If a competitor wanted to come in for Twitch TV, this is a great way to get their foot in the door.

902
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:08,920
But I think the problem is, and this is, I don't necessarily blame YouTube because it's not, it's not entirely their fault.

903
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:14,920
The reason why they're doing things that they're doing is because they're getting pressure from these other companies.

904
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:19,920
It's impossible to police everything that's on there, but they have to take these measures,

905
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,920
otherwise they leave themselves open up to a lawsuit from these companies.

906
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,920
Really, it's these companies, and don't get me wrong, I understand if I take a track from some CD or something

907
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:38,920
and blatantly put that up there in CD quality on YouTube, okay, that is infringing, that's ridiculous.

908
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,920
Which is weird because I see that shit all the time.

909
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Yeah.

910
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,920
All the time, like I could go find a top 40 hit, bring up the YouTube and play it right now,

911
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,920
although now that I know we're putting on shows on YouTube I better not, because it'll get content.

912
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,920
But I see videos all the time.

913
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,920
Or full length movies. I watched the Flight of the Navigator the other day on YouTube.

914
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,920
Get the fuck out, that video's on YouTube?

915
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
Yes it is.

916
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,920
I love that movie.

917
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,920
That movie was awesome.

918
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,920
I watch documentaries all the time on YouTube.

919
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Documentaries, sometimes they're so indie that people actually want to put that on YouTube just to get,

920
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,920
the monetization from YouTube is the only money they're gonna get otherwise.

921
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,920
There are full accounts that redistribute documentaries that may air overseas.

922
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:26,920
I watched that Extraordinary People series that airs on BBC.

923
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,920
That's how you get your Canada's Worst Driver as well.

924
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,920
I get my Canada's Worst Driver through YouTube as well.

925
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,920
I thought so.

926
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,920
Because that shows freaking addicting.

927
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,920
The problem is the system is just not real.

928
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:47,920
I think a good compromise, and even still this isn't perfect, it would be, let's say that a video comes out,

929
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,920
and let's just use an example of Nintendo.

930
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,920
Nintendo doesn't like the fact that you're using their video or something like that.

931
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,920
They're gonna monetize it or whatever.

932
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,920
I think that you should be able to split the revenue between what you've done and them.

933
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,920
I think that's a perfectly acceptable solution.

934
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,920
It gets a little complicated when you're talking music and stuff like that.

935
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,920
The music one is a real tricky slope though.

936
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,920
To some extent I think the artists licensed their music for that game.

937
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,920
They did not expect all this other stuff.

938
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,920
This is maybe how music needs to be licensed going forward,

939
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,920
but I can kind of see a little bit more where these games with these very AAA soundtracks,

940
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,920
it's a really slippery slope.

941
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,920
I kind of get that.

942
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,920
The other thing I was going to say is just because a lot of these companies,

943
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,920
and I don't necessarily like to say that, I don't blame those companies,

944
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,920
because a lot of them were like, dude, we don't know what's going on either.

945
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,920
We just started hearing about this.

946
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,920
Let us know if your video got flagged, or go ahead and object to it,

947
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,920
and we'll go ahead and flag it and let it go through and stuff.

948
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,920
We want you to have that stuff out there.

949
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:14,920
I was going to say, there are lists out there of actual games that people will let you play,

950
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,920
and they want you to play at different publishers.

951
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,920
A lot of them. There's lizard games.

952
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,920
There's a Wikia, for example, called let'splaylist.wikia.com,

953
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:32,920
and they even have a whole hashtag on Twitter, WhoLet'sPlay,

954
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:38,920
and those are all companies that will let you basically play their games,

955
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,920
and they're fine with you monetizing it, usually.

956
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,920
I think it will even let you know if they allow that and stuff.

957
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,920
For example, Minecraft, you can do that.

958
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:56,920
I was surprised, Rockstar, they're fine with you doing Grand Theft Auto,

959
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,920
and that kind of stuff in there.

960
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:04,920
There are companies out there, and I think if they're going to really...

961
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,920
I have a hard time believing that a lot of these gaming companies

962
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,920
are going to be really against people playing their videos,

963
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,920
but let's just say that there are some, then there's plenty of other alternatives.

964
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,920
Indies. Hey, Indies, I'm sure, would love some exposure.

965
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,920
Yeah. Well, yeah.

966
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Extrovert's been doing some indie games on Twitch,

967
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,920
and he'll post about it on Twitter,

968
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,920
and the game creators and their relatives will retweet it.

969
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,920
It's kind of funny, because not tons of people are streaming the indie stuff,

970
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,920
so they get really excited when they have that exposure.

971
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,920
Codeman in chat, speaking of live streaming and so forth,

972
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,920
Codeman over at live.vognetwork.com says,

973
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,920
Twitch will eventually be in the same boat.

974
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,920
It's becoming more popular, and copyright laws will hit it.

975
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,920
It's sad that these things were made to share experiences with people,

976
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,920
and a few rotten apples screwed up for the bunch.

977
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
I think he meant to say it's sad.

978
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,920
But, yeah, it's interesting, though,

979
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,920
because now Twitch is in this really interesting boat where,

980
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,920
well, they are literally integrated into PlayStation 4 now,

981
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,920
and will be soon on Xbox One,

982
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,920
or at least they certainly have that channel already.

983
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,920
Nintendo, not so much, but Nintendo kind of does their own thing with online.

984
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,920
They're not looking to get Twitch on there anytime soon.

985
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,920
But because now that Twitch is integrated into the consoles,

986
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,920
it makes it a really weird thing.

987
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,920
I can't see gaming companies suddenly coming after Twitch

988
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,920
when Twitch is a part of the console.

989
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,920
It's kind of like if you put a game out on the PlayStation 4,

990
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,920
you know that that's going to happen.

991
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,920
Although, from my understanding is, of course,

992
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,920
game companies can turn it on and off,

993
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,920
but who's going to be that dick company to turn it off?

994
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,920
I don't think anybody's in a rush to be the first to have that notorious distinction

995
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,920
of you can't stream it on PlayStation 4.

996
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,920
Granted, I guess Playroom's already in that boat,

997
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,920
but for other reasons completely.

998
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,920
Anything else on the YouTube dramas you want to share, Loki?

999
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:02,920
No, I'm just more interested to see how this is going to fall out, I guess,

1000
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,920
to see the reaction, because it only happened late last week,

1001
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,920
and I don't know if we've really heard a lot from media publishers,

1002
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,920
and YouTube's kind of said their thing,

1003
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,920
but I don't know.

1004
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,920
I'd be interested to see what steps are going to be taken

1005
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,920
if people are planning on moving elsewhere, or what's going to happen.

1006
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,920
Speaking of PlayStation 4 streaming, Black Wolf says,

1007
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,920
I believe NBA 2K14 turns off the sound on the streams and captures,

1008
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,920
so it's all silent, and that probably has to do with, you know,

1009
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,920
because a game like that's got a huge soundtrack behind it.

1010
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Those EA sports games always do, so that wouldn't surprise me.

1011
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,920
But you would think that they would still be able to do game audio,

1012
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,920
like, you know, not necessarily.

1013
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,920
Yeah, the game audio you think would be there.

1014
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,920
All right, anyhow, going to another story.

1015
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,920
Really, what they should do,

1016
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,920
and this is the appropriate solution for NBA 2K14,

1017
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,920
is to really just substitute all the music in the game with Space Jam.

1018
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,920
Space Jam the entire time.

1019
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,920
That would be the perfect solution.

1020
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,920
I believe I can fly.

1021
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,920
Huh?

1022
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,920
I believe I can fly.

1023
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,920
Amazing.

1024
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,920
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Island Radio

1025
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,920
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase shell.

1026
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,920
All right, moving on to some games that won't be showing up on PlayStation 4.

1027
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,920
They probably won't show up anywhere.

1028
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,920
It's 38 Studios, the big studio that went bankrupt.

1029
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,920
You know, that was one that the baseball player guy owned,

1030
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,920
and then they made Kingdoms of Amalur,

1031
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,920
and then they shut down, and it left the state of Rhode Island

1032
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,920
with a big debt because Rhode Island had helped them out.

1033
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,920
Well, the auction happened this week to sell off some of their IPs

1034
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,920
and the trademarks and so forth, and get this,

1035
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,920
no buyer found for Project Copernicus, which was the MMO project they were working on,

1036
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,920
no buyer found for the sequel rights to Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning.

1037
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,920
Nobody wanted to buy it.

1038
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,920
A dollar.

1039
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,920
Yeah, well, I think you have to have what they call a reasonable price.

1040
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
You have to be a reasonable...

1041
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
Two dollars.

1042
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,920
I think I've got some peanuts too.

1043
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,920
38 Studios had their own social media platform called Helios.

1044
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,920
No buyer.

1045
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,920
Intellectual property rights for Catan.

1046
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,920
No buyer.

1047
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,920
And the big huge game engine.

1048
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,920
No buyer.

1049
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,920
Did they sell anything?

1050
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,920
Yes, they did.

1051
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,920
They sold a lot that included Rise of Nations and Rise of Legends,

1052
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,920
those games and the associated intellectual properties,

1053
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,920
and then the other one that they sold was for the big huge games trademark itself,

1054
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,920
which is kind of a catchy name for a game studio, so...

1055
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,920
Catan would have been fun.

1056
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,920
Yeah, kind of.

1057
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,920
I like Catan.

1058
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,920
They already had Catan on...

1059
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,920
Yeah, I know. They did it.

1060
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,920
It was for the rights for that.

1061
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
Yeah.

1062
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,920
But anyway, apparently there were, I guess,

1063
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,920
five parties that were actually participating in the auction,

1064
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,920
but over 20 parties had expressed interest.

1065
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,920
Anyhow, what did sell went for $320,000,

1066
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,920
which might not sound too bad,

1067
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,920
but apparently Rhode Island, the debt they owe Rhode Island, 100 million.

1068
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,920
So that's practically pennies on the debt that they actually owe.

1069
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,920
Ouch.

1070
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,920
Apparently the state will continue to negotiate with interested parties

1071
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,920
to try to sell that which was unsold thus far.

1072
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,920
Yikes.

1073
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,920
Maybe the state of Rhode Island could turn into big huge games.

1074
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,920
You know, just...

1075
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,920
Hire everyone in the state?

1076
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,920
Big island games.

1077
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,920
Why not?

1078
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,920
Big island? Big? Really?

1079
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,920
Yeah.

1080
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,920
Is it really an island?

1081
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,920
Not really.

1082
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,920
No.

1083
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,920
And its name wasn't really Rhode Island either.

1084
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,920
Rhode Island's short for its full name, which is...

1085
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,920
Oh god, I'm gonna make myself look stupid.

1086
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,920
Rocky Rhode Island.

1087
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,920
No, it's Rhode Island and something plantations.

1088
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,920
That's okay. How about we just move on?

1089
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,920
No, because I don't want to look stupid here on OLR from not knowing my...

1090
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,920
You're just going on Wikipedia.

1091
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,920
I'm from California, alright?

1092
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,920
That's okay. I don't know what the crap it means.

1093
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,920
The state of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

1094
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,920
That's the full name of the state.

1095
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,920
I bet people in Rhode Island don't even know what the fuck that is.

1096
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,920
It's written on their official seal that's on the floor of the Capitol.

1097
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
Okay.

1098
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,920
At least I knew it was not just Rhode Island. Give me half credit.

1099
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,920
Okay.

1100
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,920
Alright.

1101
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,920
That seal would probably go for more than $320,000.

1102
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,920
They could probably just sell the state.

1103
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,920
They're gonna have to sell the state to get out of debt for that game?

1104
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,920
Yep. They're gonna have to get a triple mortgage on their state.

1105
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,920
Oh god, this just in. Rhode Island is now a part of New Jersey.

1106
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,920
Ah! I don't think that's too fat low. Sorry, love you New Jersey.

1107
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,920
Kidding! She's kidding people.

1108
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,920
Kidding.

1109
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,920
Alright.

1110
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,920
So how about terrorism?

1111
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,920
The state of Rhode Island and New Jersey Plantations.

1112
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,920
How about terrorism?

1113
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:06,920
Alright, how about it?

1114
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,920
Well, the NSA has a new bestie. You know who it is?

1115
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,920
Hmm.

1116
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,920
Wow.

1117
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:20,920
The NSA is going on World of Warcraft and other online games to look for terrorists.

1118
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,920
Because this is America and we're afraid of terrorists. I guess.

1119
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,920
It's not just American agencies as well. It's British agencies too.

1120
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,920
So apparently it's this whole Anglo-Saxon descent stupidity thing. I don't know.

1121
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:43,920
So the NSA and the government communications headquarters in the UK have been monitoring activity

1122
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:49,920
and harvesting data from World of Warcraft and Second Life and apparently some other games

1123
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:57,920
that they're trying to see if they're, I guess, a terrorist or trying to fish for information through MMOs

1124
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,920
just by posing as a regular player.

1125
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,920
I think that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of in my life.

1126
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,920
I think that our tax money could be spent on better things.

1127
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:15,920
And I want to know if they worked out anything with Blizzard to actually set that up or any of these other ones.

1128
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,920
No, I think Blizzard came out and said they didn't know.

1129
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,920
Yeah.

1130
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:28,920
First of all, I want to know why they think the average MMO player is going to be in on top secret government stuff.

1131
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:36,920
I mean, maybe they'll find someone who works at a, I don't know, a base or something that happens to play World of Warcraft

1132
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,920
that has some clearance. Ooh, maybe that's what they're thinking.

1133
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:51,920
It just seems to me that they are really just picking where, you know, anything that they can.

1134
01:04:51,920 --> 01:05:00,920
But they said that basically where they got the legal ability to do that was because of a 1981 executive order signed by Ronald Reagan.

1135
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,920
You know, not only did he ruin our economy, he also did that too.

1136
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,920
That gave it authority to collect the data.

1137
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,920
So privacy groups are basically, you know, stepping in and what.

1138
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:17,920
He was a real forward thinker, he's all, and the ability to spy on World of Warcraft.

1139
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,920
I don't know what World of Warcraft is, but someday this will mean something.

1140
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:29,920
At any rate, and I'm just going to read this line in this article here from Computer World.

1141
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,920
In one document from around that time, the NSA talked about how it was able to gather information on user accounts,

1142
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,920
characters, and guilds related to known Islamic extremist groups by monitoring World of Warcraft.

1143
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,920
Really?

1144
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,920
Really?

1145
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,920
I can't.

1146
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,920
I can't.

1147
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,920
Well said, sir, well said.

1148
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,920
I just, well here's the thing, I think part of this is overblown.

1149
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,920
Or mam, or mam.

1150
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,920
I think part of this is overblown.

1151
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:23,920
I'm going to be honest, I think part of this is overblown because I don't think the NSA was necessarily paying a whole bunch of people to sit around in cubicles and play World of Warcraft all day.

1152
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,920
I don't think that was quite what they were doing.

1153
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,920
Dream job.

1154
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,920
I know, right?

1155
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,920
Were they trying to like hack into it?

1156
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,920
Possibly.

1157
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,920
I think that's probably more what was going on in our gold farms.

1158
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:38,920
Well they said they were taking data feeds and whatnot, and you know, user logs.

1159
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:50,920
At the same time, it wouldn't be out of the question that they would have people who are actually trying to communicate with groups that were flagged with a certain name.

1160
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,920
And don't hear me out here just because I'm saying it's not as bad as you think.

1161
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,920
I'm not saying it's appropriate because I kind of don't agree.

1162
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,920
Because it's like, well, what good did it do?

1163
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,920
What did we stop?

1164
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,920
And you know there's those people out there that are like, lol, let's do a controversial name for our guild.

1165
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,920
Yeah.

1166
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,920
We are, you know, Pony Jihad or something.

1167
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,920
Yeah, there's tons of trolls.

1168
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,920
It's like if they were, you know, spying on Xbox Live, man, everybody's a terrorist on there.

1169
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,920
Here's the thing though.

1170
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,920
There's a difference between terrorist and asshole.

1171
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:23,920
We've heard of people that have committed hideous crimes that happen to be World of Warcraft players.

1172
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,920
It's an unfortunate coincidence.

1173
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,920
And I believe, I really hope I'm not misspeaking here, but I mean there's unfortunately so many crappy people in the world.

1174
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,920
But I believe one of them recently was that horrible, horrible guy who did the stuff with the Sandy Hook Elementary and all that, right?

1175
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,920
I believe he was a WoW player.

1176
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,920
So the police went to Blizzard and subpoenaed every chat transcript that guy ever had.

1177
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,920
Because obviously the big question people want to know is, why the fuck did he do that?

1178
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,920
That question is like not being answered.

1179
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,920
And not even the Warcraft transcripts, assumably, that they subpoenaed were able to answer that question.

1180
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:04,920
But my point is that, you know, they're able to get that information when they need it, when the police has it or whatever.

1181
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,920
But as far as prevention stuff goes, we're not seeing that anything was prevented.

1182
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,920
And I'm pretty sure his chat log would be like, LFR sucks.

1183
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,920
It's probably not very interesting.

1184
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,920
Dot's running out.

1185
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,920
This tank sucks.

1186
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,920
He'll please.

1187
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,920
He'll please, yeah, thank you.

1188
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,920
But, um, yeah, it's just, ugh.

1189
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,920
But, I don't know where I was going.

1190
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,920
The whole thing's just...

1191
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,920
I like what Dungeon Buster just said.

1192
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,920
It's no longer the Cold War, but we're still fighting things as if it were.

1193
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,920
Ooh.

1194
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,920
Very well said.

1195
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:46,920
Well, I don't know, not to be overly political too, but you also heard about Putin taking over the news sources and dissolving certain agencies.

1196
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,920
We're looking at...

1197
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,920
I remembered what it was I wanted to say.

1198
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,920
One thing you should be aware of is that your conversations that you have in these MMOs, they're not private.

1199
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,920
They are being tracked.

1200
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,920
And if something ever happened to you or you did something, they will get the records and look at every chat you've had.

1201
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,920
And that could be, you know, whether you were cybering with somebody or what.

1202
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,920
I mean, the stuff you do when you put that information on a server, it's not private.

1203
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,920
Email's not private, really, in that regard.

1204
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,920
I mean, you could go and subpoena those companies, too, and so forth.

1205
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,920
So, you know, just be aware.

1206
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,920
If you think you're having these ultra-private conversations on these websites, you're not.

1207
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,920
Nope.

1208
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,920
So, all right.

1209
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,920
However, I do have a resource for people who want to stay hidden on the internet.

1210
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,920
And it's actually a Tumblr called We Are Hidden.

1211
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:42,920
Well, you could also just take that plug that's in the back of your computer that attaches to the internet, and you can unplug it, and there you go.

1212
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,920
I'm just saying, for people who are paranoid about that, there's a resource out there.

1213
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,920
But if you're really paranoid... Wait, hold on.

1214
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,920
Because if you're really paranoid about being on the internet, don't be on the internet.

1215
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,920
I don't... I'm just saying. Do or don't.

1216
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:02,920
But with the world we live in today, you really can't not be on the internet and participate in modern society.

1217
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,920
Well, yeah, I know. But, you know, don't have a Facebook.

1218
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,920
I know plenty of people that don't use Facebook or any of that stuff, you know, so... Anyway.

1219
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,920
Facebook is its own can of worms.

1220
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:24,920
Indeed. Did you hear that thing this week? I don't even know if it's true or not, but that Facebook actually can see, like, if you type a status and you delete it, they still track, like, what you were going to post.

1221
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:29,920
Like, they were doing some type of weird, like, tracking thing behind the scenes. I swear I saw some article on that.

1222
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,920
Mine's going to be a lot of me bitching about people.

1223
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,920
Well, yeah, and I'm thinking, like, wow, mine's going to be really awful.

1224
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,920
I write a lot of very angry things that I delete and don't post on Facebook. Like, it's, like, a good little event.

1225
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,920
So I need to go back to LiveJournal if that's the case.

1226
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:49,920
LiveJournal. Let's all go back to LiveJournal. LiveJournal's going to be like, what the hell are all these people? Oh, Facebook, right.

1227
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:57,920
Bobby Blackwolf, our pal in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, sure, you can participate in modern society without the internet. Old people do it all the time.

1228
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,920
Even my mom.

1229
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:00,920
That's hardly modern society.

1230
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,920
My mom's on Twitter, for God's sake.

1231
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:10,920
Rob. I want to see what Ellen is tweeting about, Rob. How do I join the Twitters?

1232
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,920
I love your mom.

1233
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,920
Alright. Let's move on. Loki.

1234
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,920
Alright.

1235
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,920
So, let's see. Let's talk a little bit about...

1236
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,920
I just lost... What happened here?

1237
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,920
Something moved.

1238
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,920
The NSA.

1239
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,920
Damn you, NSA.

1240
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:34,920
No, let's talk a little bit about SteamOS. That just came out. Well, at least they have the beta test out there.

1241
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,920
And they also shipped out those 300 Steam machines.

1242
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,920
Sadly not to my house. I am disappointed.

1243
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,920
But, yes, you can actually check it out if you don't have a Steam machine to test that on.

1244
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,920
You can download it now.

1245
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,920
And, um, yeah.

1246
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:02,920
Of course, one of the things about the SteamOS is they're not trying to be a replacement for your own OS that you have right now.

1247
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:07,920
But it is a good, I guess, alternative for gaming or something.

1248
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,920
But check it out.

1249
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,920
And, um, they even have, uh...

1250
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:17,920
Those Steam machines that they sent out are pretty sweet and they came in like a wooden crate and everything.

1251
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,920
I'm so fucking disappointed that I didn't get one.

1252
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,920
Yeah, I know. I was really sad I didn't get one either. But, yeah, it is what it is.

1253
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:29,920
Um, have we heard anything about people that are actually using SteamOS?

1254
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,920
Because I know it's out there, but I'm not hearing a lot of, like, reviews on it or anything.

1255
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,920
Like, how it works or...

1256
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,920
I haven't heard anything yet.

1257
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,920
I guess a lot of people are just hesitant to use it because it's like, well, I'm not going to exactly overwrite Windows with SteamOS.

1258
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,920
So if you don't have a second computer for it, then, you know, what can you do?

1259
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,920
Well, not necessarily. Because I think you can multi-boot into that stuff and do it that way.

1260
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:56,920
But I'm not really sure how. I haven't messed with Steam or I haven't messed with Linux in a long time.

1261
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:07,920
Last time I tried to mess with Linux is when I heard that Linux would allow me to somehow mount the file system on some DDR disk.

1262
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,920
I don't remember what it was. Something had to do with Dancer Evolution hacking that.

1263
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,920
But, uh...

1264
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,920
Yeah, that was that.

1265
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,920
Um...

1266
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:22,920
Alright. Well, I'm going to try to move on. For our live listeners, the podcasts only will hear this.

1267
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,920
Our live stream just dropped completely. We can't connect to our streaming server.

1268
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,920
So it's not even my internet because I still see IRC and everything and everybody's freaking out.

1269
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,920
But I can't even connect to keep the show going.

1270
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,920
The NSA shut us down.

1271
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,920
Apparently they did.

1272
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,920
Jamie, would you mind? We're going to flip the script a little bit. Would you go to your story next?

1273
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:38,920
I suppose I could do such a thing.

1274
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,920
While I try to fix what's going on here, even though I might be out of my control?

1275
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:52,920
Because it's Firefly! Hello! Firefly Online is going to be a thing and it is launching in summer 2014 by developer QMX.

1276
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:59,920
And it's going to be on iOS and Android, but they are going to be expanding onto PC and Mac and may include other platforms.

1277
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,920
So there's not a lot of information out other than soon.

1278
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:11,920
But basically it's going to be you get your ship, you get your crew, you have to keep them happy.

1279
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,920
You have to, you know, trade, craft, collect, fly around the verse.

1280
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:21,920
And you also have a free form flight simulator built into it.

1281
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:31,920
And they're basically saying that it's going to be, you know, when you start off you're basically going to be kind of another version of the Firefly crew.

1282
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:37,920
You play as a brown coat captain and then you get other factions through later DLC releases.

1283
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:44,920
But it sounds kind of fun. I'm looking forward to it. I might play it because I love Firefly. It's the Joss.

1284
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:51,920
This is really cool news for those that were, because you know obviously that show had a huge cult to it.

1285
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,920
And people want to see it come back and they want to see, you know, what's...

1286
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:55,920
The comic's coming out too.

1287
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,920
Yeah.

1288
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,920
That's based after the movie.

1289
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,920
But I mean what a nice way to kind of at least continue the story.

1290
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,920
Because we all know like the show can't come back.

1291
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,920
All those actors are on to new things. It's not going to happen.

1292
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,920
Wasn't Marina Bakarin like super pregnant right now?

1293
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,920
Uh huh.

1294
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,920
I think she's super pregnant right now.

1295
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:11,920
I think so, yeah.

1296
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:12,920
Although her hair grew back.

1297
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:13,920
Oh.

1298
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,920
She had long hair in the last picture of herself.

1299
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,920
But I think this is a great way for people to, you know, at least continue that.

1300
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,920
It's weird to me that an MMO for Firefly didn't happen sooner.

1301
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:29,920
I'm just wondering how well it's going to work on a phone, you know.

1302
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,920
I mean I suppose it would be okay, but I mean just the managing your assets that way.

1303
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,920
Maybe it would be easier on an iPad or a tablet.

1304
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,920
Perhaps.

1305
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,920
But I mean I'm definitely interested in it.

1306
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,920
You know there's a...

1307
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,920
For people who are Firefly fans...

1308
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,920
Why you're nothing but Firefly pieces of pudding sitting on a plate.

1309
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,920
You're custard.

1310
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,920
No, but for people who are really into, you know, doing things in that universe.

1311
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:04,920
There actually is a tabletop game that I want to say, well, the former White Wolf put out.

1312
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:08,920
Because I think it's the same type of gameplay system as Werewolf and Vampire.

1313
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,920
Those ones.

1314
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:16,920
And like I said, there's a comic going to be coming out that's based on the Fallout after the Serenity movie.

1315
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,920
So it seems that that universe is getting a lot of love lately.

1316
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:31,920
Well, you think the fact that the Avengers is doing well and all that helps kind of bump up Whedon's properties?

1317
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,920
It's Joss. People who love Joss love Joss regardless.

1318
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:42,920
And for the record, I was never a big Buffy fan and I didn't like Angel until its last season because that was when the writers stopped giving a fuck.

1319
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,920
That was when we had the Puppet Time episode.

1320
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:52,920
But I loved Firefly. I didn't watch Dollhouse. But I've liked Joss' writing when he wrote for Astonishing X-Men.

1321
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:59,920
That's probably the most I've enjoyed any X-Men title since the Dark Phoenix stuff when I was a little kid.

1322
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,920
Our stream did come back for the live listeners. Welcome back. Apparently it was not our fault. I don't know what's up with that.

1323
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,920
But anyway, going to some comments in our chat room, SSG100Matt says,

1324
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:14,920
This still seems like an April Fool's joke. Is it a joke?

1325
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:19,920
Well, it's not April. And they've been talking about it for a month or so, right?

1326
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,920
So, because they put up the announcement a little while back, but they have a trailer up now.

1327
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,920
Alright. Well, moving on. This is pretty cool. We talked about this on Hoard House a little bit this week.

1328
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:36,920
But a new gaming network is launching. It's online. It's called ESGN, not to be confused with the ESPN.

1329
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:42,920
But it's ESGN, the Esports Global Network. It will be a 24-hour web-based broadcast channel.

1330
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,920
So it's not something you're going to find on traditional television.

1331
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:55,920
But seeing as a lot of this competitive sports watching and so forth was born out of Twitch TV and those sorts of live streamings and online,

1332
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,920
it makes sense that this is a logical next step.

1333
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:03,920
Esports, of course, is a lot of the head-to-head combat. You see some of the big games that support this right now.

1334
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,920
League of Legends, Dota 2. Of course, those MOBAs are huge for this.

1335
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,920
Starcraft 2, World of Warcraft Arena. You see a lot of this being Esports.

1336
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,920
And we've talked a little bit about this on my other show, Hoard House, as well.

1337
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,920
You're seeing now people are getting visas to come into the US for sport.

1338
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:28,920
We just had a guy for Starcraft 2 got a visa to come in on that game this week to play that. So that's pretty cool.

1339
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:37,920
Anyhow, ESGN will be launching at ESGN.com and ESGNTV.com is the video site for its dedicated 24-hour channel.

1340
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,920
Again, it is not something that's planned to be on standard television, quote-unquote.

1341
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:48,920
But what is standard TV anymore in the world of Netflix and Hulu and YouTube and all that?

1342
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,920
So this is going to be a very interesting experiment. Good luck to them.

1343
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,920
And, you know, I know we don't talk a lot about Starcraft 2 and League of Legends on this show,

1344
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:02,920
but if y'all need three fun and fabulous commentators on a Sunday night, we might be available.

1345
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:06,920
Just say if the money's right. If the money's right.

1346
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:13,920
All joking aside, let's get to the release dates. Travel the world and check out what's coming out in a gaming store near you.

1347
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,920
Probably not a lot, right, Loki?

1348
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,920
Or not a thing.

1349
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:17,920
Not a thing, huh?

1350
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,920
Not a thing. We are done for the year.

1351
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:22,920
In the U.S., right?

1352
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:23,920
In the U.S.

1353
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,920
I mean, aside from, you know, digital stuff obviously coming out, but nothing at retail.

1354
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:32,920
All right, well, let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.

1355
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:39,920
And I think the story is a little different over there because they have time for more video games before their Christmas cakes.

1356
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,920
So on the PlayStation 3 this week, Banfuse Rock Legends comes out, as well as Dragon Dragoon.

1357
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:51,920
That's a 10th anniversary box collection there, and Dragon Dragoon 3 comes out as well.

1358
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:58,920
A brand new DualShock controller in crystal color comes out, as well as FIFA 14 World Class Soccer Bonus Edition.

1359
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,920
And Shin Gondomusou comes out this week as well.

1360
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,920
And there's still some heavy hitters in Japan the rest of the year.

1361
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:14,920
The day after Christmas, Boxing Day, if you will, for Canada, in Japan they're getting Final Fantasy X and X-2's remasters are out on December 26th.

1362
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,920
So just barely making it this year.

1363
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,920
So still plenty to come over there.

1364
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,920
On the Xbox 360, Banfuse Rock Legends is there as well, as well as Shooting Love Collection.

1365
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,920
And going over to the Vita on the PlayStation Vita this week, Amnesia V Edition.

1366
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,920
Is that the same Amnesia that is the scary game that we have here?

1367
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,920
I don't think it is.

1368
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:37,920
It is not.

1369
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,920
This is more based off an anime, I believe, with a lot of cards.

1370
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,920
Looks like this guy plays cards or something.

1371
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,920
Where did all my cards go? Where did these come from? I don't know.

1372
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:46,920
I forgot.

1373
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:47,920
Because I have Amnesia.

1374
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,920
There's a crap ton on the Vita this week.

1375
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,920
Dead or Alive 5 gets a price reduction.

1376
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,920
Diabolic Lovers Limited V Edition comes out this week.

1377
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:03,920
Geki Johan Mahou Shoujo Madoka, that's Magica the Battle Pentagram, comes out this week.

1378
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,920
That's a big anime series that half my friends on Tumblr are losing their shit over.

1379
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:09,920
Okay.

1380
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,920
Hakoyuki Kuyokaroku comes out this week.

1381
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,920
Injustice gets its Vita release in Japan this week.

1382
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,920
Kudwafter, didn't we talk about this before?

1383
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:20,920
Kudwafter!

1384
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:24,920
Kudwafter has a design skin or something like that, like a Vita skin.

1385
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:29,920
But there's also the converted edition of Kudwafter comes out this week.

1386
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:35,920
Which I know we make it sound really hardcore, but it looks like this nice little Japanese girl who's having tea.

1387
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,920
And she's actually making tea in this shot, I don't know.

1388
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,920
But the game is called Kudwafter.

1389
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,920
Let's see, what else is on the Vita this week?

1390
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,920
See, Rama says fuck yes, Madoka.

1391
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,920
Shin Gondom Musou comes out this week on the Vita as well.

1392
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,920
Yay, Gondom.

1393
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,920
Busy, busy week on the Vita.

1394
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,920
On the Wii U, nothing, sorry.

1395
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,920
On the Nintendo 3DS, however, High School D x D,

1396
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,920
My Little Cat comes out in Japan.

1397
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,920
I have to see what, it's a kitty game, I have to see what this is.

1398
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,920
Oh my god, oh my god.

1399
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,920
I am flailing, this looks amazing.

1400
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,920
I need this in my life.

1401
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,920
I need this in my life.

1402
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,920
Someone get me a Japanese 3DS.

1403
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,920
Okay, it looks like...

1404
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,920
It's kitties in fancy hats.

1405
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:30,920
It looks like real pictures of cats in like sailor suits, and pink hats, and like orange Halloween sweaters.

1406
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,920
And they don't even look like they're gonna murder you.

1407
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,920
So, this is what it comes to.

1408
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,920
This is why Swap Note was removed.

1409
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,920
I'm linking, I'm gonna link that to our chatters right now so they can take a look at that because...

1410
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,920
And the chat room has harassed me into watching Madoka.

1411
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,920
I need this in my life.

1412
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:55,920
So that means that that's gonna be the next thing I have to marathon since I've marathoned all of Shingeki no Kyojin so far, and Claymore.

1413
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,920
Who makes this game? MTO.

1414
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,920
I don't recognize that name.

1415
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,920
And I'm looking on the box art, everybody loves MTO.

1416
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,920
Do they have a Twitter or something? Because I want this game.

1417
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,920
We need to petition for that.

1418
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,920
Like, oh my god, thank you for posting a picture of entertainment.

1419
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,920
We need to harass them like we did for President Cat.

1420
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,920
Which I still want to play that game too.

1421
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,920
Oh my god, I want that in my life.

1422
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,920
Koneko no album My Little Cat.

1423
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,920
Koneko means kitten.

1424
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,920
So it's like, I wonder if it's just like you take pictures of your own cat and then this program helps you...

1425
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,920
Putting Midna in outfits! Oh my god, that's gonna be great!

1426
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,920
I know, right?

1427
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,920
Hey guys, I don't know what to do with you.

1428
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,920
By the way, did you know that A Legend of Zelda The Link Between Worlds is still not out in Japan?

1429
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,920
They will not be getting that until December 26th.

1430
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,920
So consider yourself lucky here.

1431
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,920
I need to put Midna in a frilly little dress.

1432
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,920
She's gonna murder the shit out of me in my sleep.

1433
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,920
She's not gonna drop this all night.

1434
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,920
No, this is gonna be Midna.

1435
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,920
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1436
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,920
This sucks.

1437
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,920
Cause that's how she talks.

1438
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,920
Is AkumaJP helping us out here? What's this link he just gave us?

1439
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,920
I don't know.

1440
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,920
I know AkumaJP is over there and maybe can...

1441
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,920
Oh my god!

1442
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,920
They're ID pictures and you can make one look like a Bosozoku.

1443
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,920
This is outstanding.

1444
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,920
Okay, somebody get me a Japanese 3DS and this game.

1445
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,920
I don't understand. This has to do with cats being adorable.

1446
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,920
The internet would eat this shit up.

1447
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,920
Look at that picture.

1448
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,920
They're just up as Bosozoku. That's so awesome.

1449
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,920
Horrible radio. I'm sorry you guys. I'm so sorry.

1450
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:42,920
Maybe what I can do, I can beg Jason to maybe take some of these links and put some of the pictures in the YouTube.

1451
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,920
And put them on our Tumblr.

1452
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,920
Or just look it up again for yourself.

1453
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,920
Look it up again for yourself.

1454
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,920
Look it up for yourself, the game.

1455
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,920
It's out there on your favorite import gaming website.

1456
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,920
Alright, I gotta get through some PSP games though.

1457
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:58,920
But you know what? Now I'm inspired to dress up Midna on her Tumblr.

1458
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,920
Some PSP games.

1459
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,920
As if the Vita wasn't enough.

1460
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,920
You also have After School Colorful Step.

1461
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,920
Undo Yubu comes out this week.

1462
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,920
Lovely Quest Unlimited.

1463
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,920
Nobunaga no Yabu Soku with the power up kit comes out this week.

1464
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,920
That's a price reduction actually.

1465
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:20,920
Kanojo no Ura Omote, Pure Sweet Heart comes out on the PSP this week.

1466
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,920
Still kicking in Japan.

1467
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,920
Dark Soccer, how about the UK?

1468
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,920
I need the kitty game.

1469
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,920
I know.

1470
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,920
On the 18th we have Zen Pinball 2.

1471
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:34,920
And the 19th, Colossatron, Massive World Threat.

1472
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,920
That's a cool name, Colossatron.

1473
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,920
And then on Wii U we have Knit Underground, K-N-Y-T-T.

1474
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:44,920
And then Ridge Racer Slipstream for the Android, iPad, and iPhone.

1475
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,920
And nothing else until...

1476
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,920
Xmas.

1477
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,920
Maybe we should call it X-tifermas and worship X-tifer.

1478
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,920
We might do that on Hoard House this week.

1479
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,920
We are having a Holi-gay special on Hoard House this week.

1480
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,920
I wanna be on a Holi-gay special.

1481
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,920
Alright.

1482
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:06,920
Just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1483
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,920
Which may or may not have to do with cats.

1484
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:12,920
So Sony has patented a brand new...

1485
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:16,920
Looks like a Move controller.

1486
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:22,920
The difference being that instead of having an analog...

1487
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,920
I don't know if it had an analog stick on that one side.

1488
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,920
Anyways, the main difference is it's gonna have some sort of...

1489
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,920
Looks like a touch screen on it.

1490
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,920
Or not a touch screen, but a touch pad.

1491
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:42,920
Kind of like how they have on the Vita and on the front of the PlayStation 4 controllers.

1492
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,920
So maybe...

1493
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,920
It makes sense if you think about it.

1494
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:56,920
Because now they will need some sort of extra input to cover PlayStation 4 games that use the Move controller.

1495
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,920
So maybe this is what this is about.

1496
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,920
But...

1497
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,920
Interesting I guess. I don't know.

1498
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,920
I don't really...

1499
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,920
Do a lot of games use the Move controller?

1500
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:12,920
Are they gonna start bringing it back like how they did with Resistance and Killzone and stuff?

1501
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:16,920
Where they have a giant fucking gun that looked ridiculous with the Move controllers in there?

1502
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:22,920
Yeah, I kinda got the feeling they were trying to get rid of the Move.

1503
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,920
Kinda shove that under the rug or something.

1504
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,920
That's the impression I was getting.

1505
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,920
Yeah, maybe not.

1506
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,920
Interesting.

1507
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,920
Alright.

1508
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,920
Sorry, I'm trying to do a little research on this game company that makes this game.

1509
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,920
I found their websites and I'm trying to see if they have a Twitter.

1510
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,920
Apparently there's a Facebook.

1511
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,920
I'm trying to find a Twitter.

1512
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,920
There's a dog one too!

1513
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,920
Oh my gosh.

1514
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,920
But the kitty one's the best.

1515
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,920
Okay, but this is good because now I can give out this URL so the podcast listeners can be like,

1516
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,920
what the hell are they freaking out about?

1517
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:56,920
So I'm gonna just totally give them a free plug here on the show because they make games to dress up your kitties and doggies.

1518
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:02,920
mto-power.com. That's mto-power.com is the maker of these games.

1519
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:08,920
And there's gotta be a way to send them a message and let them know we want these games in America.

1520
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,920
I have hiccups now.

1521
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,920
Did the cute kitties give you...

1522
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,920
Excuse me, I didn't burp on the microphone!

1523
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,920
Damn girl!

1524
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,920
Burping is a good way to get rid of hiccups.

1525
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,920
Damn!

1526
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,920
I never, ever said I was ladylike.

1527
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,920
I know, I know.

1528
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,920
Fuck that.

1529
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,920
Thank you Tigerclaw for linking it in the chatroom.

1530
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,920
Okay, one more story for you guys.

1531
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,920
This is one of those gaming good news stories.

1532
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,920
Thank heavens.

1533
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,920
Gaming exercise games, whether you love them or you're sick of hearing about them,

1534
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,920
they do a lot of good for our community.

1535
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:46,920
And a new study is out this week about Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus.

1536
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:52,920
And of course Wii Fit Plus was available on the Nintendo Wii and now they have the newer version that's on the Wii U.

1537
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:58,920
I believe the demo is done, but you can check that out too, it's on the Wii U.

1538
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:07,920
Well, they say that Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus improves the lives of patients with Type 2 diabetes and helps control their blood sugar levels.

1539
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:15,920
This is by BMC and Docrin Disorders who carried out the trial with 220 participants for a period of 12 weeks.

1540
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,920
Half were asked to use Wii Fit Plus for half an hour a day and the second half were under routine care

1541
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,920
and just got everything 12 weeks later.

1542
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:30,920
Those that actually got the fitness game lost weight and improved their blood sugar levels.

1543
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,920
Because guess what? They were doing exercise.

1544
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:38,920
That's right, I know. That's kind of the thing. I kind of look at this and go, well duh, exercise leads to good things.

1545
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:44,920
So of course this is what happened. When you give the people the stuff for free, I guess there's more incentive to play that.

1546
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:51,920
But anyhow, experts noted that the daily physical activity increased, mental health and subjective well-being increased as well.

1547
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:59,920
The number of patients suffering from depression decreased. However, interesting, a third of the patients dropped out of the trial,

1548
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:05,920
meaning that people retaining the same level of enthusiasm over a sustained period of time was difficult.

1549
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,920
According to Dr. Richard Elliott, who's with Diabetes UK,

1550
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,920
physical activity in a healthy, balanced diet, along with taking doctor-prescribed medications if necessary,

1551
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:20,920
can help people with type 2 diabetes to control their condition and minimize the risk of diabetes-related complications over time.

1552
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:24,920
Computer games that promote a healthy lifestyle might be one way to achieve this,

1553
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,920
but different forms of physical activity might work better for different people.

1554
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,920
Further research will be needed to identify the long-term effects of such games compared to other approaches.

1555
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,920
You know what? Whatever gets people motivated, right?

1556
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:42,920
Well, I mean, the biggest thing is exercise and cutting out the sugar.

1557
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:46,920
Because guess what diabetes is? Problem with insulin!

1558
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:52,920
Although if you have type 1 diabetes, cutting out the extra sugar is not always good for you.

1559
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:59,920
Alright, well, moving on to a more simple time when we weren't really able to interact with our games, unless it was dance aerobics.

1560
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,920
When diabetes was Wilfred Brimley.

1561
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,920
That's right.

1562
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,920
The classic game of the week.

1563
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,920
Every week, Dark Sakura goes into the Classic Gaming Vault and finds one game that she thinks,

1564
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,920
hey, you guys should be playing this game.

1565
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,920
Instead of eating all that candy.

1566
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:14,920
Write the F now.

1567
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:18,920
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1568
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,920
Pole Position.

1569
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,920
A very true classic indeed.

1570
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:26,920
Yes. Basically, this arcade racer came out in 1982.

1571
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,920
I love that intro music, because that's the only music in the game.

1572
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,920
It's pretty much the only music in the game, the rest of it is just like squeaky noises.

1573
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,920
I'll keep it really low in the background just in case.

1574
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:42,920
It was manufactured by Atari, worldwide by Namco, in the US it was done by Atari.

1575
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:47,920
It was actually the most popular coin-op game in 1983.

1576
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,920
So it has an upright cabinet or an environmental cockpit cabinet,

1577
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:58,920
which my Chuck E. Cheese's slash Showbiz Pizza in Mobile, Alabama had one forever.

1578
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,920
And you know what? They still fucking have it.

1579
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,920
The same one.

1580
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,920
I'm just surprised it works.

1581
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,920
So basically you have the accelerator, you have a brake pedal, and you have your wheel.

1582
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:15,920
So it was the highest grossing arcade game in North America in 1983,

1583
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:23,920
and it sold 21,000 machines for $61 million, equivalent to 2012's $140 million.

1584
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,920
So just to put it in modern money.

1585
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,920
The most successful racing game of its time, pretty much.

1586
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,920
And it had a Saturday morning cartoon, which I watched the hell out of,

1587
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,920
and have every episode of downloaded.

1588
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,920
I also have a cool intro.

1589
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:45,920
Pole Position I think was the big inspiration for most of the modern driving games that we have now.

1590
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,920
So basically in the game you have a Formula One race car,

1591
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:53,920
and you do a time trial lap to qualify for the Fuji race track.

1592
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,920
And like we're saying, it didn't have a lot of money,

1593
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:05,920
but it was the first track, the first video game that had a track based off of a real circuit.

1594
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:10,920
So you did your qualifying lap, and then you could do the time trial, and then do the Grand Prix races.

1595
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:16,920
And it was supposed to be the most realistic at its time game that came out.

1596
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,920
Definitely didn't make me as sick as playing hard driving, because that game sucked.

1597
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:32,920
And it also was in full color, and it had scaling sprites, including your race cars and your signs to give you perspective.

1598
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:40,920
It was for the US release, Namco actually approached Bally Midway to either...

1599
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:46,920
and said, okay, one of you can get one of these games.

1600
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,920
And so Bally took Mappy, and Atari took Pole Position.

1601
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,920
So basically it's been probably one of the most ported systems too.

1602
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:01,920
It's been put out by Atari, Soft, and a lot of the home computers and consoles in the early 80s.

1603
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,920
In the 90s there was Pole Position on PC that came back in Microsoft Return of Arcade.

1604
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,920
It's been on Playstation, N64, and Dreamcast in the Namco Museum.

1605
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,920
And it's also been on PS2, GameCube, GBA, and Xbox.

1606
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:20,920
Fuji Speedway was renamed Namco Speedway in the Museum series.

1607
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:27,920
And for the Plug and Play series that were part of the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade, it was called Blue Speedway.

1608
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:34,920
And there's also a version to work with the Puffer Exercise Bite Controller.

1609
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:39,920
And it has been put out on iPod back in the day.

1610
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,920
And now we have IOS versions with Pole Position Remix.

1611
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,920
And Pole Position 2, which was the sequel, has also been re-released as well.

1612
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:53,920
Like I said, Pole Position 2 being the sequel, it came out in 1983.

1613
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:59,920
And, let me see, I hate my iPad sometimes.

1614
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:12,920
As far as that, there were also, a lot of people are saying that Final Lap is the unofficial Pole Position 3.

1615
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:20,920
Which is sort of a racing RPG spin-off that came out on the TurboGrafx-16, also known as the PC Engine.

1616
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:23,920
That version was called Final Lap Twin.

1617
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,920
As I mentioned earlier, there was Pole Position Remix for iPhone.

1618
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,920
And Pole Position 2, it had the courses for Pole Position 2 and a new course.

1619
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:37,920
And there was also a cartoon of the same name, like I said, that I watched a bunch of times.

1620
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,920
And Pole Position showed up in the movie Daryl.

1621
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,920
Remember the movie Daryl?

1622
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:44,920
I do.

1623
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,920
The boy who was an android.

1624
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,920
And he won a very high score in that game.

1625
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,920
So yeah, Pole Position.

1626
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:55,920
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Pole Position!

1627
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,920
Available like 11 billion different places, seriously.

1628
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,920
Seriously.

1629
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,920
It was just because it was the most popular arcade game that year, I remember it, you remember it.

1630
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:03,920
It's everywhere.

1631
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:04,920
It's everywhere.

1632
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,920
And you know what, we built our old main cabinet out of a Pole Position.

1633
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:08,920
Nice. Very nice.

1634
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,920
Shermie lived in it for a little while.

1635
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,920
It was her cat condo, seriously.

1636
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,920
That's a great use for a Pole Position machine.

1637
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,920
My cat is, you know how fat Shermie was.

1638
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,920
Yeah, of course.

1639
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,920
I'm like, how the crap did she get in it?

1640
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,920
She found the little door where the pedal was.

1641
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:28,920
And she would just live, we had this Pole Position machine sitting in our apartment for a year it had to be.

1642
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:29,920
Or at least half a year.

1643
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,920
And Shermie lived in it.

1644
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,920
Cats are amazing.

1645
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,920
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break.

1646
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,920
But don't go anywhere because when we come back there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1647
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:44,920
More news, the Fuqua Question of the Week, your calls, and much more when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1648
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:53,920
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1649
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,920
We are live with episode number 531 already in progress for this.

1650
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,920
December the 15th of 2013.

1651
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,920
And you know since it is getting close to the end of the year here,

1652
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:06,920
just a big Happy Holidays from all of us to all you guys out there.

1653
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:07,920
Whatever it is you celebrate.

1654
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,920
Maybe your celebration is already over.

1655
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:10,920
Like dark sacras.

1656
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:11,920
Hanukkah.

1657
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,920
Well, I live in an interfaith home.

1658
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,920
You are a Christmakah family.

1659
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:17,920
Yes.

1660
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:18,920
Which is fair.

1661
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,920
So we had, we taught Julian about Hanukkah.

1662
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,920
Because he had to study for school.

1663
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,920
He's a really good little gambler now with the dreidel.

1664
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,920
And he loves gelt.

1665
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:27,920
Who doesn't?

1666
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,920
And he was going around going,

1667
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:31,920
Hanukkah.

1668
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:39,920
And Becky and I determined that there's not a, we call it, we call it the phlegm sound.

1669
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:44,920
Because there's no real translation for phlegm sound from Hebrew to English.

1670
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,920
Other than,

1671
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,920
Hanukkah.

1672
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,920
Well, whatever it is you celebrate.

1673
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,920
And Kwanzaa is the 26th.

1674
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,920
Kwanzaa, Festivus, if you have a Festivus, pull up, enjoy it.

1675
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,920
Yule.

1676
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:57,920
Yule.

1677
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,920
Dance naked around the tree.

1678
01:37:58,920 --> 01:37:59,920
Enjoy.

1679
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,920
And just a big thank you from all of us to you guys who are such a great support for the show.

1680
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,920
We've had a really good year this year.

1681
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:10,920
And just additional exposure through, you know, Stitcher and podcasts.

1682
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:15,920
And kind of, I know personally I've met a lot of other great podcasts through GamerX.

1683
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,920
It was a great way to connect with a lot of other podcasters.

1684
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,920
That was great.

1685
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,920
And just so on.

1686
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:21,920
So I just want to say thanks.

1687
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:22,920
We've had a great year.

1688
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,920
VOG has continued to grow, which has been great.

1689
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,920
Brought on one or two new shows this year.

1690
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:29,920
I can't remember.

1691
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:30,920
I know Electric Sisterhood was this year.

1692
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,920
I can't remember if there was one other one this year.

1693
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:33,920
If that was last year.

1694
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,920
But anyway, that hopefully continuing to grow into next year.

1695
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:38,920
And just, yeah, lots of great things happening.

1696
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,920
And you guys are all thanked for that.

1697
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,920
Next year looks to be awesome as well.

1698
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,920
Cannot wait for Dragon Con 2014.

1699
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,920
Bobby and Travis Donovan done gone and got me addicted to Dragon Con.

1700
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,920
So I'm counting down the days.

1701
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,920
So I go back to Hotlanta for 2014.

1702
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,920
It's going to be very exciting.

1703
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,920
GamerX2 going to be amazing.

1704
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,920
Like, I don't even think I can handle how amazing that weekend is going to be.

1705
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,920
And so on.

1706
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,920
Whatever else I end up doing.

1707
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:06,920
I'm really hoping to get that New York City trip in this year that I've been needing to take for the past six years.

1708
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:07,920
I'm going to go.

1709
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:08,920
I just want to go to GamerX.

1710
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:10,920
There's a great OLR family in New York City.

1711
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,920
I'm sure we can make GamerX happen for you.

1712
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:13,920
Okay.

1713
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,920
That'll be easy.

1714
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:15,920
All right.

1715
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,920
So there we go.

1716
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,920
We are going to get into some more gaming news.

1717
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:21,920
Some rapid fire news.

1718
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,920
I'm trying to buy Loki a little time because he's taking care of what he has to do for his wisdom teeth.

1719
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,920
You all right?

1720
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:27,920
Yeah.

1721
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:28,920
All right.

1722
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,920
So the rinse out was salted.

1723
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,920
You salt water rinse.

1724
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:31,920
Yep.

1725
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,920
Don't want to get an infection.

1726
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:33,920
That's fine.

1727
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:34,920
I understand.

1728
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,920
It's shoving all the salted French fries in your mouth isn't the same effect.

1729
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:37,920
I really don't remember having to do that.

1730
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:38,920
I do.

1731
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:39,920
I remember that.

1732
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,920
But I remember them giving me two different mouthwashes.

1733
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:44,920
One of them was probably just salt water.

1734
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:45,920
I don't know.

1735
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,920
The other one had benzocaine in it.

1736
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,920
So that's like washing my mouth out with orgyl.

1737
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:53,920
And good Christmas shopping done in the break at the same time.

1738
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,920
All right.

1739
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,920
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

1740
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:58,920
All right.

1741
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,920
Let's talk a little bit about Fez.

1742
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,920
Fez sold quite a few copies.

1743
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:08,920
In fact, they're already surpassing 1 million copies.

1744
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,920
So that's pretty awesome.

1745
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:13,920
Especially for anybody in the indie scene.

1746
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:20,920
And to celebrate that, I'm not sure if they're releasing on any more platforms here anytime soon.

1747
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:25,920
Oh, it is on its way to Vita, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4.

1748
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,920
So soon that'll be even more copies.

1749
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,920
Elder Scrolls Online.

1750
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,920
They finally announced the launch date of April 4th.

1751
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,920
Man, that is going to be a busy month for MMOs.

1752
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,920
I got to say.

1753
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:40,920
PC.

1754
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:41,920
Well, that's for PC and Mac.

1755
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,920
Next-gen version not coming until June.

1756
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,920
So if you're hoping to get on the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, you're going to be waiting a little bit longer.

1757
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:58,920
And last but not least, this is kind of surprising because I remember this game from a while ago when Atari released it.

1758
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,920
But Marc Echos getting up.

1759
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,920
Content's under pressure.

1760
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:15,920
The kind of weird graffiti slash futuristic government totalitarian game.

1761
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:19,920
Originally, like I said, put out by Atari.

1762
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:28,920
And now, though, the rights have actually been snatched up and it's been released onto Steam.

1763
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,920
So you can check it out.

1764
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:33,920
Thanks to Devolver Digital for publishing that.

1765
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,920
And that's available on Steam.

1766
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,920
And I think it's actually, at least it was on sale.

1767
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:42,920
So yes, it's still on sale for 50% off.

1768
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:47,920
So $7.49 if you want to check out the game if you may have missed it.

1769
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:52,920
Alright, moving on in music gaming news that isn't so happy.

1770
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,920
DJ Max Technica 2 and Technica 3 had this online thing called Platinum Crew.

1771
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,920
Not to be confused with the Vita version of DJ Max Technica, which I know a lot of you have.

1772
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,920
But the arcade versions had the Platinum Crew.

1773
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,920
Unfortunately, that is shutting down.

1774
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,920
It will no longer be available as of December 31st.

1775
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,920
December 31st?

1776
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:12,920
Hey, what about my flan?

1777
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:16,920
That's what happens when you get 30 and first slammed together, you get thirst.

1778
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:20,920
If you're thirsting for some DJ Max Technica 2, you better get that in before the end of the year.

1779
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:24,920
Because unfortunately, it is all going down the very last day of the year.

1780
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:31,920
And unfortunately, I think that whole, I kind of think there's, I get the impression there's no more Technica coming out at all.

1781
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,920
Because I don't think the Vita version did too hot either, unfortunately.

1782
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,920
Because it was a lot of fun.

1783
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,920
I think that's kind of, kind of dying.

1784
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:40,920
It's too bad.

1785
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,920
Maybe Shane can set me straight because I know he's big on DJ Max.

1786
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,920
Oh, he says in chat, he's actually there.

1787
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,920
Shane will link on our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

1788
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:48,920
It says, sadness to DJ Max.

1789
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:49,920
All but dead now.

1790
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,920
Yeah, pretty much, unfortunately.

1791
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:52,920
Alright.

1792
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,920
Anyhow, moving on to other things.

1793
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,920
Another thing that's shutting down is Ghosts and Goblins Demon World.

1794
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,920
Well, hold on.

1795
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,920
This wasn't a Capcom project, it should be noted.

1796
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:07,920
This was an unauthorized sequel from an indie developer, Phantasm Studios.

1797
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:11,920
They were working on a Kickstarter and, probably not a big surprise,

1798
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:15,920
it got pulled due to an intellectual property dispute.

1799
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:16,920
And who closed it?

1800
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:20,920
Capcom submitted a request on November 19th.

1801
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:23,920
Phantasm was trying to get a developer's license for the game.

1802
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,920
It would have reimagined a lot of the Ghosts and Goblins stuff.

1803
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:31,920
If for whatever reason they did not get the rights, they were going to rename it King Arthur.

1804
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,920
That's what they were just going to call it.

1805
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:38,920
However, it got shut down because I guess Capcom didn't really,

1806
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:42,920
it was one of those things where it sounded like they were, just getting the impression again,

1807
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,920
they were going to do that after the fact, not before the fact.

1808
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,920
And Capcom didn't want the name of the game being used like that.

1809
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:51,920
So I can kind of see that.

1810
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:57,920
In happier news, our track record for helping out Kickstarters improves this week

1811
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:02,920
as read-only memories did get funded.

1812
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,920
I got to admit, they were really close.

1813
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,920
It was really down to the wire, but they did make it.

1814
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,920
So congratulations to Matt Kahn, who was on the show a couple weeks ago,

1815
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,920
as well as everybody over at MidBoss Games that helps him out

1816
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,920
because they did reach beyond their goal.

1817
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:21,920
They hit a final tally, 64,378.

1818
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,920
And they were trying to make 62,000 to get matched by Ouya.

1819
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:27,920
But the good news is now they will be matched by Ouya.

1820
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,920
So yeah, that game is happening.

1821
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:33,920
So we're hoping that will be playable at GamerX too.

1822
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:38,920
So congrats to those guys over there at MidBoss Games. Woot.

1823
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:39,920
Totally cool.

1824
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:40,920
Look forward to playing.

1825
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:44,920
Wow. Did you see the screen capture that Bob Coffee just put in chat?

1826
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:45,920
I did not.

1827
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,920
Oh, yours don't load, do they?

1828
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,920
Yeah, what am I looking at here?

1829
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,920
Hi, I'm Wayne Brady from Nintendo.

1830
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,920
Wayne Brady. That's awesome.

1831
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,920
That's funny. Okay.

1832
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:56,920
Is that a gold shirt?

1833
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:57,920
Yes, it is.

1834
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:58,920
Wow. Okay.

1835
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:00,920
Well, it's a gold letterbox.

1836
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:06,920
Well, there is a Fable Anniversary set coming out on February 4th, 2014.

1837
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:10,920
That's the 1080p HD version of the original Fable.

1838
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,920
So actually it will be a good game.

1839
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,920
And it will also have launch day weapons and outfits pack.

1840
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:21,920
And you get a loot weapon that is supposed to be pretty awesome.

1841
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:28,920
In other news, there is an officially licensed Mega Man board game that's on Kickstarter.

1842
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:34,920
And they are seeking $70,000 by January 19th.

1843
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:38,920
And it's already over $160,000.

1844
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,920
So people really like Mega Man.

1845
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:45,920
The core version is the 25th anniversary with 9 figures.

1846
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,920
4 of which are Mega Man.

1847
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,920
4 robot masters and 1 Dr. Wily.

1848
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,920
And that's a $70 dollar packet.

1849
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:58,920
And then for $140 you get a deluxe version that adds Time Man and Oil Man.

1850
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:04,920
And 40 card player decks and individual robot master game boards and dozens of token pieces.

1851
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,920
So good for them.

1852
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:14,920
And another cool thing, and this is actually thanks to my hubby who gave me this bit of news while I was trying to work last night.

1853
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:21,920
Ultra Street Fighter 4 is going to have online training and 3 versus 3 matches like King of Fighters.

1854
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,920
So you can get your Street Fighter 4 on KOF style.

1855
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:37,920
I am just looking forward to doing my final fight team of Andore, or Hugo, sorry, Poison, and...

1856
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:38,920
Guy, right?

1857
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:39,920
Yeah, Guy. I think Guy is in it, isn't he?

1858
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:40,920
Yeah, Guy is in it.

1859
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:41,920
Yeah, and Guy.

1860
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:42,920
Because that's my team.

1861
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,920
Hagar is in it too, isn't he?

1862
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:48,920
I don't remember about Hagar, but I know Cody and Guy were in Super Street Fighter 4.

1863
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:53,920
They were some of the characters added there because I love playing Guy because he was my guy in Final Fight.

1864
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:57,920
Guy was my alpha person. It was him and Sakura were my alpha people.

1865
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,920
I remember when they released Final Fight Guy on the NES. It was such a big ass deal.

1866
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,920
And you know what I have? Final Fight Guy in the box.

1867
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:08,920
Although, I'm sorry, not on NES, Super NES was Final Fight Guy.

1868
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,920
It was a Blockbuster exclusive.

1869
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:13,920
What's that other, god fuck.

1870
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,920
Mighty Final Fight was the other one.

1871
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,920
Mighty Final Fight was the Nintendo one.

1872
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:18,920
It was the SD.

1873
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:19,920
It was kind of shit, you guys.

1874
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:20,920
It was.

1875
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,920
It's one of those things where everybody's like, yeah, Mighty Final Fight!

1876
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:23,920
And then when they play it, they're like, wow.

1877
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,920
But it was fun. It was fun for being shit.

1878
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:26,920
Yeah.

1879
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:31,920
But I mean, I'd have to say that Final Fight Guy was always my...

1880
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:36,920
I had a copy of it that I had borrowed from someone who stole it from Blockbuster.

1881
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:39,920
Hey, as in Alabama, we're poor!

1882
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:40,920
Classy.

1883
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,920
Fuck.

1884
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:47,920
And then I gave it back, and I moved out here with my friend's Chrono Trigger that he just let me keep.

1885
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:53,920
And Dan and I looked into Final Fight Guy loose, and then we looked into the box separately.

1886
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,920
So now we have Final Fight Guy in the box.

1887
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:59,920
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vlognetwork.com says,

1888
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,920
Let's just cut to the chase and do a Capcom versus SNK3 already.

1889
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:03,920
Fuck yes.

1890
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,920
Amen. Hands in the air. Hands in the air. Testify.

1891
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:07,920
Preach it.

1892
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,920
Preach. Preach.

1893
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:10,920
Did I tell you...

1894
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:11,920
This needs to happen.

1895
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:15,920
By the way, one of the other games that we bought last night was Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

1896
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:16,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

1897
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:19,920
Well, we had to buy one, get one, and we couldn't find another freebie game.

1898
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:20,920
Alright, well if you had nothing better to do...

1899
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:22,920
We also got Metal Gear Rising.

1900
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:23,920
Okay.

1901
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,920
So we could play around as Pretty Boy.

1902
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:27,920
Alright, is that it?

1903
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:28,920
Yeah.

1904
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:31,920
Alright, let's go to the Fookal Question of the Week.

1905
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:32,920
Fookal.

1906
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:39,920
Every week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities,

1907
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,920
we ask a question and you guys answer it.

1908
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:43,920
And you know what?

1909
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,920
Because it is the holiday season and I'm feeling awfully charitable,

1910
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,920
I think I'm going to read all the answers tonight,

1911
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,920
of which there are an awful lot of them.

1912
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:51,920
Yay, Rob.

1913
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:52,920
So heads up, guys.

1914
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:53,920
You can do it.

1915
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,920
I can do it.

1916
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:55,920
Cheerleader.

1917
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:56,920
Alright, here we go.

1918
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:57,920
How many answers are on Facebook?

1919
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:58,920
Seventeen. We can do this.

1920
01:48:58,920 --> 01:48:59,920
Alright.

1921
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:01,920
Here's the Fookal Question of the Week.

1922
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,920
And, oh God, this was a moment in history on the internet.

1923
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:11,920
The internet just exploded and the gifts were priceless.

1924
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,920
Because I'm sure you've all heard by now,

1925
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,920
the bombshell that was dropped on the music industry,

1926
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:18,920
when Beyonce just released a new album.

1927
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:19,920
But Jesus.

1928
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,920
With no promotion or fanfare.

1929
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,920
And the whole internet went to the Church of Jesus Christ

1930
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,920
and was like, preach, honey.

1931
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,920
And on top of that, it's good.

1932
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,920
It is a great album.

1933
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,920
And I think my favorite thing that came out of the whole thing

1934
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,920
is that gift where Beyonce goes to the table

1935
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:42,920
and she just swipes all the albums of Katy Perry and Gaga and Miley

1936
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:43,920
and everything just right off the table.

1937
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,920
Although I will say this quickly, tangent, sorry, apologies,

1938
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:51,920
but I hate this shit where we keep pitting women against each other

1939
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,920
and there's only one women diva.

1940
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:57,920
Like look, Beyonce is queen.

1941
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,920
We recognize that's fine.

1942
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:04,920
But it doesn't mean that she has to be better than all these other women

1943
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,920
who try just suck or garbage.

1944
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:07,920
Yeah, like Justin Bieber.

1945
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,920
Yeah, like Justin Bieber.

1946
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,920
Stop picking on her.

1947
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,920
Yes, exactly.

1948
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:14,920
You're so awful.

1949
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:15,920
But you know what?

1950
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,920
VH1 had that whole divas thing for a while, remember?

1951
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:18,920
Yes.

1952
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:19,920
That was cool.

1953
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,920
Remember when they would all come together at the end and sing

1954
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:25,920
and they brought out Carol King at the end

1955
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,920
and everyone tried to out diva Carol King

1956
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,920
and you don't out diva Carol King.

1957
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:30,920
I'm sorry.

1958
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,920
On her song.

1959
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:32,920
Although I understand.

1960
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:35,920
Like Beyonce just fucking out diva'd them all.

1961
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,920
She just walked into the room, dropped the mic and left.

1962
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,920
Like I get it, but you know.

1963
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:40,920
Because she's bejesus.

1964
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:44,920
I think we should support all talented artists.

1965
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:47,920
And I also just like that her album is called Beyonce.

1966
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,920
Anyhow.

1967
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:51,920
So all that aside.

1968
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,920
Shane is blowing up in chat.

1969
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:54,920
I'm so sick of her.

1970
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,920
So, so sick.

1971
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:58,920
And it's a fucking huge album.

1972
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,920
I went back to check how many.

1973
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:01,920
What she did though.

1974
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:02,920
What she did was unprecedented.

1975
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:03,920
400,000 copies sold.

1976
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:07,920
That's like Gaga and Britney combined.

1977
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,920
There's like not just all the music,

1978
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,920
but she's got videos out for half the stuff on the album.

1979
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:13,920
All of them.

1980
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,920
Yeah, and that's on.

1981
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:15,920
And they're good videos.

1982
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:16,920
Anyway, look.

1983
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:17,920
Moving on.

1984
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:18,920
Sorry.

1985
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:19,920
But here's the thing.

1986
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,920
You're like, what the fuck does this have to do with gaming Rob?

1987
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,920
Didn't Beyonce sue a video game company?

1988
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,920
Yes, she did.

1989
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,920
But here's the point.

1990
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:28,920
The gaming community is.

1991
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,920
This is no stranger to us.

1992
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:31,920
Like we see this all the time, right?

1993
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,920
They come out in E3 and say, Hey, if you want to get this today, you can.

1994
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:36,920
Like what?

1995
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:37,920
What are you?

1996
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:38,920
Entertainment.

1997
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:39,920
We need to stop all this woman on woman fighting.

1998
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:40,920
We need woman on man fighting.

1999
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:43,920
I'm going to see Beyonce take out Nickelback for good.

2000
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:47,920
I think everybody wants to see Beyonce take out Nickelback for good.

2001
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,920
I would like to see it like fricking.

2002
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:51,920
I don't know.

2003
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,920
Celine Dion can take out Nickelback for good for all I care.

2004
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:55,920
All right.

2005
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,920
Anyway, so the gaming industry is no surprises.

2006
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:58,920
We see these.

2007
01:51:58,920 --> 01:51:59,920
It's out today.

2008
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:00,920
Announcements a lot.

2009
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:03,920
What if you could in the gaming community have one?

2010
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:09,920
I said realistic stealth announcement because I didn't want people to be like hologram gaming out today.

2011
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:16,920
Like, okay, if you could get a realistic stealth announcement this holiday season, what bombshell do you want to see drop this holiday season?

2012
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:17,920
So here we go.

2013
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:23,920
Coming up first from Jimmy B, who I think honestly, he got five likes on this post.

2014
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,920
So I think he kind of has the winning answer here.

2015
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:32,920
But Jimmy B over on Facebook says, Half-Life 3 pops up on Steam on Christmas morning.

2016
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,920
Internet explodes.

2017
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:37,920
We're praying, everybody.

2018
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:38,920
Prayer circle.

2019
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,920
Let's all form one.

2020
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:41,920
Half-Life 3.

2021
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,920
That would be the bombshell I'd like to see.

2022
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:44,920
That would melt Steam.

2023
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:45,920
That would melt the internet.

2024
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:46,920
Are you kidding?

2025
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,920
Which is ironic.

2026
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:49,920
Steam melting.

2027
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,920
All right.

2028
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:53,920
Jeremy Jay, our buddy from Koopa Club.

2029
01:52:53,920 --> 01:53:01,920
Hey, Jeremy Jay says, I'd love to see Game Boy Advance games appear on the Wii U eShop all stealth-like.

2030
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,920
Specifically Metroid Zero Mission.

2031
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,920
But yeah, that's a good realistic prediction.

2032
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,920
Nintendo making more money off of old games.

2033
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:09,920
Absolutely.

2034
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,920
Degenerate Johnny says, I want Rockstar to announce that Grand Theft Auto 5 is out now for the Wii U.

2035
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,920
It's current gen, so making a port shouldn't be a problem.

2036
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:24,920
Plus, you can use the touchpad screen to help navigate throughout the city as well as play around with the iFruit app while playing GTA 5.

2037
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,920
Sorry, Loki, but I had to speak my mind.

2038
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:28,920
Why did he have to apologize?

2039
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:31,920
Would you be offended by Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Wii U, Loki?

2040
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:32,920
No.

2041
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:33,920
All right.

2042
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:34,920
It would be kind of awesome, actually, with it.

2043
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:35,920
He's right.

2044
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:36,920
The whole integration with the app would be pretty cool.

2045
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:40,920
For the record, back to the Beyonce versus Nickelback thing.

2046
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:43,920
While I think Beyonce could take Nickelback, I think Rush could take Beyonce.

2047
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,920
All they had to do was have Neil Peart drum on her head.

2048
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,920
Anyhow, moving on.

2049
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:58,920
Our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad, says, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 emulation on the new consoles.

2050
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,920
Don't think that's going to happen, buddy.

2051
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,920
Sorry.

2052
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:07,920
Well, the PlayStation 3 would be a lot closer because of the Gaikai technology.

2053
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:08,920
That's possible.

2054
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:09,920
Xbox 360, I don't know.

2055
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:12,920
I mean, Microsoft will do it, maybe, if they can.

2056
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:13,920
We'll see.

2057
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:16,920
Fabrice A. replies and says, easy.

2058
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:18,920
Sega launches a new console.

2059
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,920
Why not stick to the classics?

2060
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:30,920
Robert K. said, the rumored to-be-finished Shenmue HD is released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in time for the in-game release.

2061
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:35,920
In time for the in-game Christmas festivities because sailors and I need hope.

2062
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:41,920
Robert K. taking a game of Lucky Hit on his gander there, so good luck.

2063
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,920
Code Man says, I would like Nintendo to announce a new Mario Galaxy.

2064
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,920
I literally went crazy when I played the game for the first time.

2065
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:50,920
I think a lot of people would like to see a new Mario Galaxy.

2066
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,920
Fifth Dream says, is Fallout 4 realistic enough?

2067
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:55,920
Final Fantasy 15?

2068
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:56,920
Probably not.

2069
01:54:56,920 --> 01:55:02,920
But it would be cool if Sony suddenly updated the PlayStation 4 with CD, MP3, and streaming media support.

2070
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:03,920
A firmware update.

2071
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:04,920
That could definitely happen.

2072
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:10,920
Elliot B. says, I could ask for a new Metroid Prime or Guitaro Man, but I'll go with something a little more realistic.

2073
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,920
Heists in GTA 5 Online.

2074
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:16,920
Launching the online mode without a decent selection of co-op missions was very silly.

2075
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,920
Even the fighter jet death matches are getting stale.

2076
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,920
Rockstar, throw us a bone already.

2077
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:21,920
You agree with Elliot?

2078
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:22,920
Loki?

2079
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:23,920
You want to see some heists?

2080
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,920
Heists would be fun, but I don't think it's necessarily getting stale.

2081
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:31,920
But now that they have all these content creator things, it'd be cool to do your own missions.

2082
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,920
Or make custom game types and stuff.

2083
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:40,920
Cial responds and says, Capcom releases a new Good Mega Man, or a new 2D Metroid from Nintendo.

2084
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:49,920
Daniel T. says, the announcement of Virtual Console crossed by, followed by a One More Thing announcing the availability of, as Jeremy said,

2085
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:55,920
select Game Boy Advance titles, or in my dreams, DS and GameCube titles would make me fanboy so hard.

2086
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:02,920
John from Critical Myth, our pals over there, Mondays 4 o'clock Pacific on VoG, says,

2087
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:07,920
Final Fantasy XI Free to Play on PS Vita, 24th December 2013.

2088
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,920
I think Loki would like that very much as well.

2089
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:15,920
Blood Drunk replies and says, Steam Holiday Sale Day 1, Half-Life 3 status available now.

2090
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:26,920
Gaben moves forth and ascends to godhood as the father and savior of gaming and ends this holiday season console wars as PC becomes the definitive master race of this generation and the next.

2091
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:32,920
I feel like that response should have been read to like, duh, duh, duh.

2092
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:34,920
Or in the Howard Cosell voice.

2093
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,920
Yes. But don't expect me to do that when I'm sick.

2094
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,920
You all know my impressions are not very good.

2095
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:48,920
Jennifer L. says, I would love the next generation of Pokemon to come out all stealthily. Kids around the world would panic.

2096
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,920
I somehow, I don't think Pokemon games are capable of coming out without hype, but that would be really funny to see happen.

2097
01:56:55,920 --> 01:57:04,920
Raginator says, as totally unrealistic as it may be, I'd say that for the Steam Winter Sale, everything is completely and utterly free for a certain period within the sale.

2098
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,920
It's a pipe dream, yeah, but one can dream, right?

2099
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:17,920
Maybe a Valve game will be free. I mean, they did give away Portal at one point. You never know. There might be a Christmas gift, or like a Christmas reward for participating in the sale.

2100
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:22,920
That happened before once too. I think that's how I got like Alien Swarm 2 or something like that. One of those games.

2101
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:29,920
And lastly on Facebook, our pal Delvin from Video Game Realness, which is a really fun podcast out of Canadian.

2102
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:40,920
Delvin replies and says, some kind of major Wii U release that none of us saw coming. Not Star Fox or Metroid, like something no one is expecting.

2103
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,920
Spanish Inquisition the game.

2104
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:49,920
Then we might have a bit more restored faith in Wii U and say they knew what they were doing all along.

2105
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:59,920
Sadly, I think Wii U needs the fanfare to kind of get their investors rallied up a little more, but I'm going to hope. I'm going to form a prayer circle with you.

2106
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:04,920
Because I would love to see that happen on Wii U as well. And shut them haters down. Shut them haters down.

2107
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,920
Alright, a few comments from Google+. Redertainment says, price drop on everything.

2108
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:18,920
Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, PS3, 360, games, accessories, everything reduced in price. Also, I'd like a pony.

2109
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,920
Okay, Jamie. That was a very Jamie answer.

2110
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:29,920
I was trying to reply something Ron said about PC will never become the master race for gaming. All games will be nerfed to console standards. Not quite so.

2111
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,920
Because there are some people that refuse to leave Mac. Don't forget that.

2112
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:39,920
Anyhow, as far as Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and all that goes, 2014. It will be a belated Christmas gift for entertainment. Belated.

2113
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:50,920
ActDeft says, a secret Nintendo Direct this week. Before we sign off, we would like to gladly announce that we're releasing F-Zero Universe.

2114
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:58,920
A new installment on the beloved F-Zero franchise with HD graphics, online play, and a new customization mode so you can change your machine however you like.

2115
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:05,920
When's it going to be released, you asked? Right after this Nintendo Direct is over on the Wii U eShop and a retail version in January.

2116
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:07,920
How's that for a bombshell announcement?

2117
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:11,920
Well, I came. That's exactly what I'd like to hear.

2118
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:15,920
Rob. Rob.

2119
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:21,920
I came over to the computer to place my pre-order. That's what I meant. Nothing dirty.

2120
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:23,920
You don't have to call your mom.

2121
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:33,920
Sam H. Please don't. Sam H. says, Uncharted 4 available today. Colin M. says, Shenmue 3. Chalk another Shenmue answer up there.

2122
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:43,920
And lastly but not least, Tech 2030 replies and says, a new all hand drawn 2D Metroid game for Wii U or 3DS would make me the most excited.

2123
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:49,920
There you go. I love those answers. Thank you guys over on Google Plus and Facebook. Our Fugu question of the week.

2124
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:55,920
I did read them all. I was in the holiday spirit. I wanted to read them all. I like hearing people's fanboy dreams.

2125
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:59,920
What about you guys? Anything you would love to see the stealth announcement comes out?

2126
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:15,920
I was replying to chat room. I don't know. I mean, really right now. I don't know. I really don't know. I guess I would go with the half-life thing.

2127
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:20,920
Because that would be pretty awesome. Just the half-life. Okay, we're done. Bye.

2128
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:33,920
The one thing I want more than anything. Dear Jesus, for your birthday, I would really like more than anything to see after all these years and all this hoping.

2129
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:38,920
Remember, pray to be Jesus. And all this praying. Oh, Beyonce.

2130
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:45,920
Dear Beyonce, may I please have the Guardian Legend on Virtual Console. Yes! Can I get an amen? Yes.

2131
02:00:45,920 --> 02:01:05,920
Or a true sequel. I will take what I can get. We need a Guardian Legend variety game. Compile needs to rise from their grave and not do any more Puyo Pop. We need more Guardian Legend and more compile shooters.

2132
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:17,920
Alright, and locally? I'd go for a new DDR. You're just keeping it civil. I just want a new DDR. I mean, that would be shocking.

2133
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:28,920
Hey, we're gonna do a new T-Garian. Really? What? It's only shocking if it's good. I would like for our Roosevelt Golf Land to magically have a 2DX machine again and not get rid of it.

2134
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:40,920
By the way, Scandia's gonna get a 2DX machine probably. What? Well, you may remember the guy that runs Shonigan. He has this wonderful arcade. In his garage? In his garage.

2135
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:51,920
Well, it's also the drive-in, too. No, I ran into, he works at Scandia. Yeah, he's picking three of his machines to bring in there. One of which is a 2DX 20, I guess, or whatever.

2136
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:58,920
We actually randomly met while I was playing some game over there, one of the shooting games, and we just started talking about his machines.

2137
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:05,920
I would love to get that guy on this show if he's here locally. He's on my Facebook. Send him a message. Get him on the show.

2138
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:12,920
Alright, Shane is sending me a private message in chat because apparently I skipped his answer. It's because you answered late, you jerk.

2139
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:25,920
But our buddy Shane from Hoard House says, I won a stealth announcement for F-Zero for Wii U and 3DS in the same style as the ACGX versions and then unlockable GX versions in both the Wii U and 3DS.

2140
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:31,920
And Jack Levin's theme making a comeback because it was the best in GX. That's an awfully tall order, but I would love to see that.

2141
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:40,920
Sorry, go ahead. The current votes for machines that they are going to bring is, top three machines will go to the location, top three so far.

2142
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:48,920
2DX Linkle upgraded to Tricoral, Poppy Music 20 upgraded to Sunny Park, and DGMax Technica 3.

2143
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:54,920
Actually, other is number three, but who knows how other is.

2144
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:59,920
I agree with all of these selections, and I forgot what I was going to say, so it doesn't matter.

2145
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:01,920
Well, then let's get back into some news. Loki.

2146
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:11,920
Alright. So the Xbox One, let's talk a little bit more about that. I'm kind of surprised that they kind of went back.

2147
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:24,920
I guess they never really worked for retail games, but they're not requiring demos. It's up to the devs to basically decide whether they're going to put a demo for their game.

2148
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:31,920
Now originally, you had to have a demo for any Xbox Live Arcade game that was out there.

2149
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:37,920
But now I guess they're kind of going the route of the retail games where it doesn't necessarily have to have a demo.

2150
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:45,920
I kind of think that's a little lame because games are expensive, and sometimes the demos get you to buy the game.

2151
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,920
Or in some cases, it gets you not to buy the game if you can't beat the demo.

2152
02:03:50,920 --> 02:04:00,920
But yeah. I don't know. It's interesting. There is one of the demos that they're actually putting out.

2153
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:11,920
I really hate, I think Nintendo was the one that kind of started this, but those demos that have a certain number of playthroughs you can do on them before they lock you out of them completely.

2154
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:19,920
Like Dead Rising 3, they're going to let you play it for 20 minutes, and then you can play it for two more times other than that, and then it's done.

2155
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:21,920
That's interesting.

2156
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:27,920
It's not that different from what PlayStation Plus has you do. You can play the first hour, but still.

2157
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:38,920
Yeah, but I remember back when they had the timed demos for Saints Row, and I played that demo over and over and over again, and it just got me hyped about the game, and I bought it immediately when it came out.

2158
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:43,920
But that's how I killed my time until it came out, is by playing that demo over and over and over again.

2159
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,920
I guess, just, whatever.

2160
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:50,920
Do you have to download the whole stinking thing just to play 20 minutes, or does it do the streaming thing?

2161
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:52,920
I think it's probably a shorter demo.

2162
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:54,920
That's good.

2163
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,920
It's apparently the map, but it's just 20 minutes of it.

2164
02:04:58,920 --> 02:04:59,920
Interesting.

2165
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:12,920
And they've also hit the 2 million sales mark as of the 11th, so hooray.

2166
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:14,920
Oh sorry, go ahead.

2167
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:17,920
So everybody's doing well, selling lots of consoles.

2168
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:22,920
Everybody's spinning it like they're winning, but at the end of the day they're both doing well. Sony and Microsoft anyway.

2169
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:33,920
Here's the only thing, not that I'm worrying about any of these companies, but I'm seeing a pattern emerge here, and it's what I saw with the Wii U.

2170
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:38,920
Where, oh yeah, these things are sold at. Oh yeah, they're gonna be hard to find.

2171
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:44,920
And yet, I'm hearing from a ton of people, hey I just saw a pallet of those just sitting at Costco, no one buying them.

2172
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,920
Hey, I just saw a stack of those sitting at Target, no one buying them. Hey, I just saw a stack of them over there.

2173
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:51,920
PlayStation 4 is not to be found.

2174
02:05:52,920 --> 02:06:02,920
So it gets me worried that maybe they aren't flying off the shelves. Not to say that they're doing bad, I mean they sold 2 million units worldwide, so that's not bad, but it may be slowing down a lot faster.

2175
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:08,920
And I think a lot of that has to do probably with the launch line up, there's just not a lot to drive people to buy them.

2176
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:15,920
So that's my concern, and I guess it would go with PlayStation 2, because maybe they're just not producing a ton of units.

2177
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:18,920
I think they're about neck and neck as far as sales go.

2178
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:24,920
It should be said as well, even though maybe Nintendo's not having the best luck with Wii U, and it doesn't seem like their fortune's turning around.

2179
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:29,920
I mean they're selling more of them, but it's not in the same league as these other consoles right now.

2180
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:35,920
3DS still continues to sell wildfires, I mean that's a huge success story for Nintendo, so at least there's that.

2181
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:37,920
So they won't be going out of business.

2182
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:39,920
No.

2183
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:46,920
Anyhow, speaking of sales, let's go over to the MPD numbers, and Loki you might have to help me out here a little bit, because you read into more of the stuff than I do.

2184
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:53,920
But video game sales for the US in November up 7% from last year, which you would hope is going to happen when you have new consoles out.

2185
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:59,920
Hardware jumped up 58%, again with two new consoles out, you would hope those numbers go up.

2186
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:06,920
PlayStation 4, the top selling console in November, and PlayStation was number one in sales overall for home consoles.

2187
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:11,920
My 9,000 fans will be quick to tell you that, well, they had an additional week to sell those consoles.

2188
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:14,920
Whatever, again, they're both doing very well.

2189
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:22,920
909,132 Xbox One units sold in the US in the first nine days, meaning over 100,000 a day.

2190
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:26,920
The top selling games, here's the top ten.

2191
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:28,920
Number one, Call of Duty Ghosts.

2192
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:30,920
Number two, Battlefield 4.

2193
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:32,920
Number three, Assassin's Creed 4.

2194
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:34,920
Number four, Madden 25.

2195
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:36,920
Number five, Grand Theft Auto 5.

2196
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:38,920
Number six, NBA 2K14.

2197
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:40,920
Number seven, Skylanders Swap Force.

2198
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:42,920
Number eight, Just Dance 2014.

2199
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:44,920
Number nine, Disney Infinity.

2200
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,920
And number ten, FIFA 14.

2201
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:52,920
No surprise at all, you've got your typical big sellers, the Call of Duty and the Battlefield, your Assassin's Creed.

2202
02:07:52,920 --> 02:08:00,920
The sports balls, Grand Theft Auto's still in there, and then the kiddie toy games with Skylanders and Disney Infinity rounding out your top ten.

2203
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:02,920
Not a lot of surprises in there, right?

2204
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:07,920
No. Let's talk about some of those Nintendo numbers, because we do have some numbers about Nintendo.

2205
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:14,920
770,000 Nintendo 3DS's sold in November.

2206
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:21,920
So the 3DS has been out for a couple years, and they sold almost as many of those as they did Xbox Ones.

2207
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:23,920
Pretty good.

2208
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:28,920
Also, Wii U hardware sales, they say up by 340%.

2209
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:36,920
But I think we all know that's kind of a spin, because three times a little number is still not probably going to be a huge number.

2210
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:38,920
But it is what it is.

2211
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:43,920
But Super Mario 3D World, 215,000 digital and physical units in the first eight days.

2212
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:49,920
Not too shabby, especially in light of the article from Japan that didn't have quite the impressive number last week.

2213
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:53,920
But it should be noted that didn't allow it to crack the top ten.

2214
02:08:54,920 --> 02:09:05,920
But considering that Super Mario 3D World is on one console, and one console that hasn't really cracked through, as well as every single one of those games in the top ten that I read off, multiple formats.

2215
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:12,920
Yeah, I would assume I'm looking right here at some of the weekly charts for hardware.

2216
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:15,920
Trying to see if I can pull up older stuff.

2217
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:17,920
That's not helping.

2218
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:28,920
Anyways, for hardware though, for example, the week of the 7th, that would have been the week ago, Wii U moved 72,000 units in North America.

2219
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:32,920
And the 3DS, 244,000.

2220
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:41,920
Kind of give you an idea, when they're saying 700,000, you're probably looking at maybe 150,000 units of Wii U.

2221
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:43,920
It's not bad.

2222
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:45,920
It's good.

2223
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:51,920
Again, it's one of those things where it's not going to bankrupt the company, but it's going to be very interesting to see what they do in 2014.

2224
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:53,920
Like, is Nintendo going to stick with it?

2225
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:59,920
And I kind of think they're stubborn enough, and they believe in it enough that I think they're going to stick with it.

2226
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:09,920
I'm not sure what they're going to do to sell more, but I think they believe enough in Bayonetta, and Smash Brothers, and whatever Zelda or Mario game they have hidden up their sleeve for holiday 2014.

2227
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:12,920
Mario Kart next year is going to be huge.

2228
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:15,920
I think they believe enough in those that they're going to still try.

2229
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:26,920
I hope it turns it around for them, because if Mario Kart or Smash Brothers can't move units, then they're going to be in trouble.

2230
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:30,920
There are some people saying that Nintendo will announce a new console at this E3. No.

2231
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:32,920
No. That's way too soon.

2232
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,920
Internally, are they having that dialogue? Probably.

2233
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:40,920
But, I don't know. It's going to be very interesting to see what happens at E3 this year for Nintendo.

2234
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:46,920
They seem to be pushing themselves into that outside of the regular release stuff, you know?

2235
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:53,920
Well, it's just disappointing. The third-party support's just not there. I mean, they're going to be showing stuff on screen.

2236
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:59,920
They're always going to say that they have the third-party support, but they don't have full third-party support, and that's what's really hurt them.

2237
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:01,920
Well, 3DS does.

2238
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:05,920
Not necessarily. There's no EA 3DS games anymore.

2239
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:07,920
Oh, wow. Okay.

2240
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:09,920
Yeah, they've completely cut them off.

2241
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:12,920
There's plenty of stuff on 3DS keeping it going, you know?

2242
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:14,920
There's plenty of stuff on 3DS.

2243
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:19,920
That's when they speak about Nintendo partners and not just 3DS and Wii U separately, you know what I mean?

2244
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:24,920
Yeah, because EA's not supporting them on any of the platforms right now.

2245
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:29,920
Zebediah the Messiah in our chatroom says, Mario Kart Wii U bundle and I'm in.

2246
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,920
I think that's a guaranteed from Nintendo.

2247
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:37,920
If not, you know Costco and Best Buy and all that. They're going to have their bundles, absolutely.

2248
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:45,920
YYR says, Smash Brothers usually sells consoles, but I think the biggest threat to Smash selling Wii U consoles is Smash for 3DS.

2249
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:53,920
Well, the other thing, too, is a lot of people already bought the Wii U for Smash Brothers, so you can't really count a lot of new sales from that.

2250
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:56,920
Who buys a console for a game two years out from now?

2251
02:11:58,920 --> 02:11:59,920
Really?

2252
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:01,920
We kind of considered.

2253
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:03,920
You considered, but you didn't?

2254
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:05,920
No.

2255
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:06,920
You know, anyway.

2256
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:12,920
I would say if you're going to get a Wii U, get a fucking Wii U because the Mario 3D World is one of the best games you're going to play this year, period.

2257
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:21,920
Especially if you have people in your house to play games with or people over frequently, you will not find a better party multiplayer game experience than you will with Mario 3D World.

2258
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:28,920
That's what you're missing. But, you know, again, do you want to pay three, what would that be, about $300 system plus game?

2259
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:30,920
Just wait, the price will come down.

2260
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:33,920
Do you want to pay $300 to be the coolest kid on the block?

2261
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,920
I don't know.

2262
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:39,920
Anyhow, let's move on. More news. Dark Sakura.

2263
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:47,920
Well, I do have another bit of news, and this actually came to me by means of one of my friends who I met through Tumblr.

2264
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:52,920
And I have to give you the story of how I met her later, but it was very interesting.

2265
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:54,920
Trading porn pics?

2266
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:56,920
No. Okay.

2267
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:58,920
I love Tumblr. I'm just here for the gifts.

2268
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:03,920
I was at the Russian market and saw one of their free publications with someone's Homestuck fan art on it, on the cover.

2269
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,920
And the article that it was advertising had nothing to do with Homestuck.

2270
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:11,920
So I found out who did it, messaged her, and mailed her the magazine in Australia.

2271
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:13,920
Wow, that's something.

2272
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:21,920
And so we've been chatting off and on back. She's a really good artist. She's done a thank you pic for me. She's a really, really good artist.

2273
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:36,920
But she linked me this story about how the South Australian government is doing an anti-gaming campaign that has a little girl with shades on at a poker table looking at her iPad saying, gambling starts with games.

2274
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:45,920
And basically what they're trying to do is, you know, I think it has more to do with the Facebook style and casual games.

2275
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:51,920
You know, the online poker and the microtransaction type games.

2276
02:13:52,920 --> 02:14:00,920
But they have a site that's called nogame.sa.gov.au, which I hate giving it anything, but go look at it and laugh.

2277
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:08,920
So basically it's supposed to say, it's wanting to add an MA 15 plus to any game that includes simulated gambling.

2278
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:21,920
Meaning slot machines, card mechanics, even what was the last Pokemon games, Diamond and Pearl had like a slot machine thing in them, didn't they?

2279
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:23,920
I don't remember.

2280
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:30,920
Or, you know, any game that has some kind of variety of anything that could be construed as gambling.

2281
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,920
So they're trying to get this bit of a...

2282
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:38,920
Is Pachinko considered gambling? Because Nintendo Land has the Pachinko in it. It's totally gambling.

2283
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:41,920
Well, Pachinko technically is gambling, it's just...

2284
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:44,920
Final Fantasy X-2 has like, Casino Land.

2285
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:50,920
Well, I mean, look at Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Casino Night Zone.

2286
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:52,920
Which was like the best zone in the whole game.

2287
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:59,920
MM2K in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Australian government hates games. It sure seems that way.

2288
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:13,920
Well, Ron Curry, who is the CEO of Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, has gone out saying that the view is supported by the fact that there was no consultation with an industry lead in the lead up to this policy announcement and the subsequent awareness campaign.

2289
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:21,920
Meaning that they haven't even reached out to work with the companies, they're just going on a broad generalization.

2290
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:32,920
And, you know, the way that this was linked to me is, have you seen this fuckery? I mean, that's not exactly what, you know, how she said it, but it was pretty much the same thing.

2291
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:41,920
And she was going on to explain how there's a lot of revenue in South Australia comes from slot machines.

2292
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:48,920
There's a big problem with gambling because, and I believe they're called pokies there?

2293
02:15:48,920 --> 02:16:00,920
But we're blaming games for that? I just, out of curiosity, I wanted to know, because you know, right here in the States right now, everybody's talking about Mega Millions, because the lottery is up to like $500 million, even I'm buying a lotto ticket, that says something.

2294
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:09,920
I usually don't pay the idiot tax, as my mom calls it. You gonna pay the idiot tax, Rob? You know, when you buy the lottery tickets, you're an idiot. But anyway.

2295
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:11,920
Yeah, she wouldn't be saying that if you won.

2296
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:13,920
Yeah, exactly. When I win and we see what home she gets put in.

2297
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:16,920
Let her retire in Boca.

2298
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:26,920
Well, as she also says, it costs a dollar to dream these days, doesn't it Rob? Anyway, the reason why I bring that up is I was curious, does Australia have the lottery?

2299
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:32,920
And because I don't know much about the culture there, does Australia have lottery? Maybe some chatters can set me straight. I don't know if we have any Aussies in chat tonight.

2300
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:39,920
But I'm looking at Wikipedia, which I always love to go to, to look up information. It looks like there's some different types of Australian lotteries, kind of depending about where you are.

2301
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:48,920
There's TATS has a lottery in Victoria, Tasmania, in the Australian Capital Territory, in the Northern Territory. And then there's some state-owned, including the South Australian lotteries.

2302
02:16:49,920 --> 02:17:00,920
So the reason why I bring that up is like, well, okay, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. The government has a sanctioned lottery system, yet we're gonna pinpoint video games as don't play games because it'll lead to gambling.

2303
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:22,920
Okay, well, and this is the other thing, too. And then it's actually caused, and just going by what my friend told me, and she links me to quite a bit of information, is that there, apparently when they brought in the slot machines, and I think she called them pokies, you know, like poker machines or something.

2304
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:33,920
But she said that they've actually been instilled in a lot of bars and public, you know, in pubs, and have replaced like live bands playing and other things because they do bring in a lot more money.

2305
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:44,920
And you don't find as many just, I guess, cultural events. They've all become these loud places that attract an unfavorable element.

2306
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:53,920
And it's caused, you know, there have been political parties formed to, you know, to get rid of the legalized gambling.

2307
02:17:54,920 --> 02:18:12,920
And so if people are having such a big problem with it to the point that they're trying to censor games to prevent that, why don't they just pass the legislation and get rid of the machines, or else regulate them a lot harder than they are now?

2308
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:19,920
Here's the other side of that. They get a lot of money from those machines. They get a lot of money from those machines.

2309
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:29,920
It was like in Mississippi, after Katrina, because they didn't want the casinos on Mississippi soil so they were on barges.

2310
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:40,920
And then right after Katrina hit and the casinos were like, we're going to leave because we're not going to build them on barges for the next hurricane to knock us over.

2311
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:46,920
Mississippi changed their laws really quickly so that they could keep that source of revenue and keep all those jobs in Biloxi.

2312
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:55,920
Yeah, it's obviously, if you know somebody that's addicted to gambling, you know, that's a real thing, but there's lots of, you can get addicted to anything.

2313
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:58,920
You know, you can get addicted to video games and that's dangerous too.

2314
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:00,920
It's obsessive compulsive behavior.

2315
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:05,920
Yeah. So, you know, if you're going to, I like gambling. Did video games cause that? I don't think so.

2316
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:07,920
I hate gambling.

2317
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:13,920
I also put a limit on my gambling. Like if I go to Reno or something, I usually say, okay, a hundred dollars in fun money.

2318
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:20,920
That's how much I would spend on a concert ticket to go see a AAA concert or, you know, a night out with drinks for Alan and I.

2319
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:36,920
Your limit is about 10 times more than my limit because the only times I have ever gone gambling, like with a purpose, is when I had 50 cents and needed cab money and made myself $15.

2320
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:43,920
Well, and it, it depends. It depends too. Like a hundred dollars is like my weekend in Reno type money, you know, that's reasonable.

2321
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:54,920
But if I'm just, you know, I'm going to the Indian casino out in Roseville, I'll maybe spend $10, you know, not even that. So just depends on what I'm doing.

2322
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:59,920
YYR in chat says, gambling video games might cause gambling.

2323
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:08,920
Well, but I don't, I don't know. Like it's just weird for me to say that, oh, because they played it in the game, they, they got addicted to gambling.

2324
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:14,920
I mean, if that, if they were wired for that anyway, wouldn't just playing gambling kind of get them into that?

2325
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:29,920
It has to do with, and this is, I kind of have a problem with calling certain behaviors an addiction, except they do, they do give that same sort of chemical response.

2326
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:44,920
So in that case, you're creating your own drug by performing the action. And so it comes, the only way to break that is to either remove the ability to do the action or remove the positive sensation that comes from the action.

2327
02:20:44,920 --> 02:21:00,920
But even with, you know, losing money, losing friends, you know, suffering financial difficulties because of the reward, the, the behavior, it doesn't stop that feeling of pleasure that somebody gets from participating in it.

2328
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:07,920
Which is why you have people that are addicted to gambling. You have people that are addicted to gaming. You have people who are pathological house cleaners.

2329
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:12,920
You know, it's all the same kind of pleasure response that comes from.

2330
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:19,920
That's my mother. My mother will follow you in the house with a vacuum cleaner. She will, no joke. I have literally caught her doing this.

2331
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:26,920
So like I had a cup of coffee and I sat it on her counter or whatever. And like, you know, I was talking to her and then I picked it up and put the cup away in the sink.

2332
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:29,920
And she came in right behind me and wiped down the counter.

2333
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:54,920
But it's, I'm trying to, um, there's, and for a lot of people, you know, I'm trying to, to get back to what I was trying to say with this too, is that instead of treating the enabler being the gambling or the gateway as they're calling it, the games that have the gambling element,

2334
02:21:54,920 --> 02:22:06,920
they need to treat the, the behavior addiction. You shouldn't penalize a whole group for something that's a problem of a handful of people.

2335
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:14,920
Well, if you or someone you know got addicted to gambling and video games are to blame for it, we'd love to hear from you. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2336
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:16,920
Meanwhile, back into the news, Loki.

2337
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:19,920
That sounds like one of those advertisements for like Ricky Lake or something.

2338
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:22,920
Call 1-877-GO-RICKY!

2339
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:28,920
Did your drag queen dad beat you when you were a child? If so, call us now.

2340
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:31,920
That show is such a fucking train wreck. I love it.

2341
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:36,920
Cause she'd be like, oh my God, I'm not getting into this, just stand back and watch, like, oh my God.

2342
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:42,920
It was always that look of her hand pressed against her face and her jaw dropped, like, I can't control what's going on.

2343
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:45,920
Oh, Ricky, go back to doing, uh, uh, Waters movies.

2344
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:53,920
The legit best weave pulling of all time came from the Ricky Lake show, too. Just Google it. Like, Ricky Lake weave pulling, you'll, it's fascinating. Anyway.

2345
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:55,920
So, yeah.

2346
02:22:56,920 --> 02:22:59,920
SSJ 100 Matt says, uh, Australian PSA don't gamble or a dingo will eat your baby.

2347
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:04,920
I'm sure the Australians that listen to this show greatly appreciate that, SSJ 100 Matt.

2348
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:11,920
So, what do you expect? When a game service doesn't exactly work like it's supposed to, what are you to do?

2349
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:20,920
Of course, you're, you know, you should go on the internet and complain. And then, of course, then the lawyers come and decide, hey, let's make this into a class action lawsuit.

2350
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:27,920
In which case, that's what's happening now with a law firm investigating EA and Battlefield 4.

2351
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:35,920
Um, law firm Holzer Holzer and Holzer Holzer and Fistel. I love that name. That's awesome.

2352
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:52,920
Um, LLC is investigating whether EA, um, I guess, you know, claim, they claim that regarding the development and sales of Battlefield 4 and its impact on EA's revenue and project moving forward, compile, or complied with federal security law.

2353
02:23:52,920 --> 02:24:00,920
I don't even know what the hell that means. All that I know is people are bitching about Battlefield 4 and that I'm guessing that they're smelling money somewhere.

2354
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:07,920
That, hmm, that whole SimCity thing was really fucked up and people were really pissed by that. Maybe we can get some of the money out of that.

2355
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:09,920
EA's got money, right?

2356
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:13,920
Yeah, EA's got a bit of money, I think. Because they charge us for everything.

2357
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:17,920
Um, I'm thinking, though, that this may not necessarily be...

2358
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:21,920
If the internet wins this class action lawsuit, we lose.

2359
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:35,920
Well, here's the thing. It's not necessarily for, like, people that are playing the game. It's for investors, basically saying that they misled investors that they knew that Battlefield 4 was going to be a fucked up thing and that they knew that they were going to lose money and stuff.

2360
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:46,920
And so that's how, you know, that's what it's all about. But, yeah, I mean, seriously, though, it's money. They smell money, they're going to go for the money. It's like blood and sharks.

2361
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:48,920
What are you going to do?

2362
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,920
The shark is delicious, but you can't eat people.

2363
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:59,920
Alright, well, I know I would eat this game right up if it comes out. Who doesn't love the Seiken Densetsu series?

2364
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:06,920
And if you don't know it by that name, perhaps if I said Secret of Mana? Remember that game? That was a classic, classic Super Nintendo game.

2365
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:08,920
Which is sad because Legend of Mana was kind of crap.

2366
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:12,920
Legend of Mana was pretty balls, but Seiken Densetsu 3, really good.

2367
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:14,920
Hardcore awesome.

2368
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:24,920
Secret of Evermore, underrated. I realize it wasn't really part of the same series because it was Square America's game, but underrated, I think. Time, you know, kind of was really mean to that game.

2369
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:30,920
But, anyway, the Of Mana series, I think a lot of us would love to play a new game in that again.

2370
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:42,920
Well, there are hints that an unannounced title in the series could be brewing, and this is because of a Christmas album that featured a song from an as of yet unreleased game.

2371
02:25:42,920 --> 02:25:51,920
The official page for Xmas Collections 2 includes a mention of Seiken Densetsu, the series' Japanese name, labeled as Future Project.

2372
02:25:52,920 --> 02:26:02,920
Now, could this be Circle of Mana? Circle of Mana was a Japanese release on iOS and Android devices, which is very strange that we don't have that here yet.

2373
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:06,920
I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of time before that's translated and comes out over here.

2374
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:13,920
Jamie instantly picked up her phone and started searching. Only in Japan, Jamie. Only in Japan. You can look and bookmark it.

2375
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:15,920
This is why you jailbreak your devices.

2376
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:27,920
Right? So, anyhow, I know I would love to see a new Of Mana game. I really hope that is something that's in the pipeline for, oh, wouldn't that be an awesome PlayStation 4 game?

2377
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:33,920
A new Of Mana game? I just hope it's more Secret of Mana and less Legend of Mana. That would be amazing.

2378
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:39,920
Dark Sakura, Loki? Do you think there could be any truth here? Do you think it's just Circle of Mana?

2379
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:41,920
I need new pants.

2380
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:50,920
Alright. Let's move on to the mailbag. Dark Sakura, unfortunately, will have to put her phone down to find the game that she's not going to be able to find.

2381
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:53,920
And we're going to go to the mailbag.

2382
02:26:53,920 --> 02:27:05,920
Alright, every week you guys email us mailbag at orangelountradio.com and Dark Sakura's going to dive into the mailbag head first and find an email that she thinks, hey!

2383
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:07,920
This one's twitching.

2384
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:14,920
This one should be read on air because if I don't read it, we'll get another email next week chewing me out.

2385
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:18,920
Only a couple emails this week, right? Just one or two, right?

2386
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:20,920
Three.

2387
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:22,920
Oh, three. Okay.

2388
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:31,920
You guys do a video game podcast, but you couldn't be bothered to actually watch a video games award show. However, you were able to do a little Monday morning quarterbacking and bash the show none of you watched.

2389
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:38,920
Wow. I didn't bash anything. I watched the livestream, and it was better than the usual shtick you see in award shows.

2390
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:46,920
Instead of making a big deal about the subjective superlatives of best this and that, the show is bringing gamers the previews of upcoming games, something all gamers are normally excited to see.

2391
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:56,920
And bashing Joel is just mean. He was hired to do a job, and I thought he earned his pay. Calling him transphobic was unfairly judgmental, considering you didn't watch the show and everything you heard about it was taken out of context.

2392
02:27:57,920 --> 02:28:05,920
Hey guys, you do have a right to your opinion, but next time do your homework. You do a video game podcast. It seems a little odd and disappointing that not one of you took the time to watch the show again. Wow. Sincerely, Nark.

2393
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:10,920
I don't remember saying anything about the guy because I didn't watch it and I didn't have anything to say.

2394
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:22,920
I didn't watch it and I was recanting things that I read across the internet. I know that people were offended at some of the things that Joel McHale said, whether you weren't or not, other people were.

2395
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:25,920
Wow, I thought I was defending them, but yeah.

2396
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:37,920
You know what, this guy's welcome to his opinion, but I kind of have a problem with the, because I didn't, he says, because you guys have a video game podcast, you should watch this show.

2397
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:39,920
No. Why?

2398
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:43,920
If it's something I don't care about watching, I don't have to watch anything.

2399
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:59,920
I listen to other independent podcasts that do their award shows and I'm curious what they have to say. People like, you know, you and me that do their own shows and I read websites. What, what makes this any more or less of a deal than those?

2400
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:08,920
That was not proven to me in the email. The only thing I heard in there was, Oh, they have previews of new games. Great. I did look at all of those on YouTube after.

2401
02:29:08,920 --> 02:29:13,920
Yeah. And if Joel was so great, why did they excise him completely from the TV version?

2402
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:27,920
And I watched part of the show and I didn't, can't watch the whole thing because I had things to do that day, but I did catch part of it and I commented on the part that I saw as well as the recaps I saw on YouTube, which I know were cleverly edited together.

2403
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:42,920
If I was going to be perfectly honest about it, I've been so busy with school and other stuff. I actually didn't even know it was on. So like I said, I, I have my feelings about what I've heard from that, but I don't care either way.

2404
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:46,920
If you play a musical instrument, are you required to watch the Grammys?

2405
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:48,920
No.

2406
02:29:48,920 --> 02:30:04,920
If you make home movies, are you required to watch the Oscars? That's I'm just, you know, I'm just kind of throwing it out there as like, I, I I'm challenging is, I mean, because obviously this guy puts VGX up on a pedestal, you know, which is fine.

2407
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:09,920
You're allowed to do that. And maybe, maybe, maybe we were too harsh on things.

2408
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:25,920
I think his criticism is that we're criticizing the show yet we didn't watch the entire show, but Oh my God, if I had to watch that entire show, I'd be tearing my hair out because it was slow. It was very slow paced. And, and I was trying to, I was trying to explain two things last week.

2409
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:38,920
One, what I heard everybody else saying, because yeah, of course I'm going to kind of, you know, say, Oh, this is the feeling I was getting. And I read this person's blog that was very upset over the joke that Joel McHale said, because this was a transgender person themselves.

2410
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:53,920
It was very upset at the joke, you know? So yeah, I was going to communicate that, you know, I heard some people were pretty pissed off at this joke. And then, um, uh, I'm telling you why I don't, you know, I don't watch it because I don't see the reason to.

2411
02:30:54,920 --> 02:31:07,920
And it's not like I can sit here on a video game show and just flat out say, which is the honest truth, that I didn't care about the fact that there was an award show. I didn't care who won and I didn't care about watching it. That doesn't make good radio.

2412
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:18,920
I love video games. You, the emailer, love video games. The chatters that are here love video games, Dark Soccer and Loki love video games. That is why we do a video game podcast. End.

2413
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,920
For the record, I really didn't care.

2414
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:33,920
No, and I don't want to like sound combative or anything, although this email was pretty pointed because everybody does have a right to their opinion. And I can get where you're kind of like, well, don't shut your, shut your yap if you're going to comment on something you didn't even watch.

2415
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:38,920
But I, it's what's going on out there. We have to comment on it somehow.

2416
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:48,920
And this is a big human nature kind of thing, at least amongst the average neuro-typical human being. No one likes to hear when someone does not like something that they like.

2417
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:59,920
A very good point. However, it must be understood that sometimes you may like something and other people either will not like it or don't give a shit about it. You have to live with that.

2418
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:11,920
You wrote that article on VOG this week all about Homestuck, which is something, well, but to be fair, that's something plenty of people have judged without really looking at it themselves. Would that be accurate to say?

2419
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:12,920
I'd say so, yeah.

2420
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:23,920
And that could be plenty because some of the cosplayers have been boneheads, and you touched on that in the article. And so, you know, sometimes it's people giving it a bad image and so forth.

2421
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:36,920
Well, when I was looking for graphics, because I wanted a good background to do the banner from, I actually found a write-up by a mother who had just thought it was the crap.

2422
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:45,920
She wasn't interested in it, she thought it was corrupting her kids, and then actually took the time to sit and go through the entire thing and ended up loving the story.

2423
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:53,920
I mean, a mom probably in her 50s ended up really liking it, and already a sci-fi fan found things that she could relate to in it.

2424
02:32:54,920 --> 02:33:06,920
And I think that, you know, maybe if I had sat down and watched it, then maybe I would have liked it, but I didn't care enough, and I didn't bash it. I don't think I bashed it, did I?

2425
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:12,920
I don't know. Chris109 in our chat room says, video games rule. I agree, dude. Video games rule.

2426
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:18,920
And Chris109 says, opinions. They are awesome, yet cause issues because people misunderstand it.

2427
02:33:18,920 --> 02:33:25,920
You know what, I'm gonna say thank you for the email, and I think if people think we need to be called out on something, then do it.

2428
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:33,920
Tone is gonna be very important in that. If we get an email that says, fuck you, you fucking fuck, then we're probably not gonna respond to that in kind.

2429
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:35,920
Because that's probably one of my emails.

2430
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:46,920
Well, it goes back to that Facebook comment from a couple weeks ago. As long as you do it respectfully, we'll have a respectful dialogue, and then at the end of the day, have a beer and play some games.

2431
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:49,920
I don't think that the email was disrespectful.

2432
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:57,920
I don't either. It was a little bit pointed, but I understand why there's anger.

2433
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:09,920
But I also think that at the same time, just because, and this is something actually I kind of wish I'd put in my article too, is that for, and I do understand that if you're not gonna watch something, it doesn't put you in a position to bash it.

2434
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:18,920
However, it doesn't mean that you can't, you know, take a community-wide opinion and report on it. Which is what we did.

2435
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:23,920
Have you bashed Lady Gaga's album without listening to it?

2436
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:25,920
Well, I haven't listened to it.

2437
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,920
I'm just asking the listenership out there.

2438
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:32,920
There's people who will flat out just bash Lady Gaga because she's her.

2439
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:37,920
Or bash a movie that you haven't really seen. Or bash a musical.

2440
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:39,920
Or bash Nickelback because it's cool.

2441
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:48,920
Well, okay, let's be real though. Yes, I have heard plenty of Nickelback, unfortunately, and all that's just, I think we can all agree Nickelback sucks.

2442
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:51,920
Next email, sorry.

2443
02:34:51,920 --> 02:35:00,920
Season's Greetings and Salutations, O.L.R. I love when people say that. You know what movie that line came from? Heathers. Greetings and Salutations.

2444
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:02,920
I love Heathers. I need to watch that.

2445
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:04,920
Had Shannon Doherty in it. She was awesome.

2446
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:06,920
So was Winona Ryder.

2447
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:08,920
I love Winona Ryder. I want her to be my sister or something.

2448
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:10,920
When Winona Ryder showed up.

2449
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:16,920
My dream family is like George Takei as my daddy and Winona Ryder as like my cool older sister.

2450
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:18,920
Betty White as your grandma.

2451
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:19,920
Betty White as my grandmother.

2452
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:24,920
When Winona Ryder showed up in Star Trek, I was so excited.

2453
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:27,920
I know, and then they cut like half her seams.

2454
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:29,920
So disappointing. Anyway.

2455
02:35:30,920 --> 02:35:32,920
Okay, firstly, I hope Rob is recovering from the VOG plague.

2456
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:37,920
First, I heard it affect Jess from USL, then Shane from Hoard House, now Allen and Rob.

2457
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:41,920
To prevent yourselves from getting the plague, all VOG members should perform the anti-VOG plague ritual.

2458
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:47,920
It involves a dead hippo, burnt out TV tubes, short bits of string, and fire-breathing squirrel. No.

2459
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:53,920
I feel a lot better today than I did yesterday. I don't have a temperature and I'm not like congested in the head.

2460
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:59,920
It's just I have stuffiness, but I'll be back to work tomorrow. It just sucks to be sick on a weekend when I had social stuff planned.

2461
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:05,920
I love everybody in the chat. Chris, Winona, and I know they really suck.

2462
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:12,920
Anyways, the reason I am emailing you all is because this week has been a significant week for my mobile gaming.

2463
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:16,920
For the past few months, I've been playing a mobile game called Jurassic Park Builder.

2464
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:22,920
It's basically a run-of-the-mill sim game involving filling your park with dinosaurs and leveling them to create cash.

2465
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,920
This cash can be used to expand your park, place buildings, and deck out your park.

2466
02:36:26,920 --> 02:36:30,920
This week, I was taken aback with the game's recent update, which integrated a dinosaur battle arena.

2467
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:36,920
This arena allows your dinosaurs to battle against the AI's dinosaurs, and soon it will integrate multiplayer into this battle system.

2468
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:45,920
This new update has totally changed the flavor of the simple management simulator into becoming a strategic Pokemon-like fighting game only with dinosaurs.

2469
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:51,920
With that being said, have you ever encountered an update on a non-MMO game that changed the very nature of the original game?

2470
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:54,920
How did you feel about those changes? Not so sincerely, Degenerate Johnny.

2471
02:36:55,920 --> 02:37:00,920
That's a really tough question, because in this day and age, I mean, we're used to the whole patching and things like that,

2472
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:06,920
but like, you know, that's something new in the past ten years where games are updated like that and changed like that.

2473
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:09,920
That's only new since iPhone. I honestly can't think of anything.

2474
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:17,920
I know one, Mortal Kombat 2, from the beta versions to the new ones because you lost your infinite combos as they tweaked stuff.

2475
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:25,920
Ooh, Luminous on the iPhone actually made it playable, because the first version was awful, but then they actually changed the control scheme and it's actually playable.

2476
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:32,920
That was a big one. Let me say this though, I'll answer the question with this, so I'm going to take it a slightly different direction, sorry about it,

2477
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:37,920
but back in the day, I remember when sequels would go in really random directions.

2478
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:45,920
Like Zelda 2? Right, Zelda 2 for better or worse. I did a Let's Remember this week, plug plug, on my YouTube channel, Rob Roberts Plays,

2479
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:50,920
youtube.com slash Rob Roberts Plays, plug plug, but I did a Let's Remember for the game Donkey Kong 3.

2480
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:56,920
Yes, that one was bizarre. Wasn't it? Yes, it was very bizarre because it was such a departure, and I even talked about this in the video,

2481
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:59,920
it was such a departure from Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr., because those two were platformers.

2482
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:03,920
Although I think it had more in common with Junior. Well, Donkey Kong 3 was a fucking shooter game.

2483
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:11,920
Yeah, but it was with the Donkey Kong skin on it. But the otherwise look of the game, I think, had more in common with Junior.

2484
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:18,920
Except for the fact that Stanley disappeared, never to be seen again, except in obscure references in Smash Brothers,

2485
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:23,920
and I think was in a Game & Watch game, but that's really it. But I think about back in the NES games,

2486
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:27,920
sometimes sequels were really radical departures from the original games, absolutely.

2487
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:36,920
Even Castlevania 2 really played, I mean, sure it was still the whole jump and whip and all that type of stuff that the first game had.

2488
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:43,920
But what a terrible night for a curse. But the first game was more of an arcade game, where the second game was more of an adventure backdrop.

2489
02:38:44,920 --> 02:38:51,920
It was more of an annoying game. I love the sequel though. 3 was great. Anyway, that's the best we can do with the answers there.

2490
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:55,920
By the way, SSJ100Matt says that Heathers is going to be an off-Broadway show.

2491
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:59,920
Well, I was going to say in chat as well, Raginator, talking about Heathers, Raginator in chat says,

2492
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:03,920
Heathers also gave us the line, well fuck me gently with a chainsaw.

2493
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:12,920
It also gave us the line, Big Fun was one, and I love my dead gay son.

2494
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:22,920
If you're a fan of Orange Lawns Radio, you do need to watch the movie Heathers. Have you seen the movie Heathers, Loki? Please tell me you've seen Heathers.

2495
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:23,920
No.

2496
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:25,920
Oh my god, Loki, you're killing me.

2497
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:27,920
Oh my god, that's the best movie.

2498
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:32,920
It also was like...

2499
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:36,920
They used to play it on Comedy Central like every other day.

2500
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:40,920
Great pate, but I really must dash if I'm going to meet that funeral.

2501
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:45,920
Alright, anyway. Watch Heathers this holiday season. You'll thank us later.

2502
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:52,920
And it's the movie that got Que Sera Sera stuck in my head every time someone says the name Heather.

2503
02:39:57,920 --> 02:39:58,920
Last email.

2504
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:11,920
Dear Orange Lawns Radio, with the release of some less than stellar Wii U and Super Mario 3D World sales figures this past week, it has been provided yet another excuse for doom and gloom for the console.

2505
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:19,920
This led me to wonder when exactly sales figures started mattering to people who aren't investors, more than liking the games and the systems that were being played.

2506
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:25,920
I myself have loved my Wii U since release date, and it has absolutely changed how gaming has fit into my life.

2507
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:33,920
My boyfriend has become an avid gamer due to a mixture of first-party titles and indie releases that he would never have bothered playing elsewhere.

2508
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:41,920
The system never fails to create memories at parties, and Nintendo's mastery of the couch co-op style of gameplay is still as evident as ever.

2509
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:54,920
But even loving the system as much as I do, I am still given pause to doubt myself when I hear people focus so heavily on something as impersonal as sales data as something that should speak to the quality of a system.

2510
02:40:55,920 --> 02:41:03,920
I understand that low sales numbers have a heavy implication on the future viability of a system, but what does this have to do with the games that are out?

2511
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:07,920
How are the existing games made any better or worse because fewer people have played them?

2512
02:41:08,920 --> 02:41:19,920
People never seem to poo-poo games exclusively that are niche titles and have limited sales potential, yet any big-budget or big-name title that underperforms always seems to face this criticism these days.

2513
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:30,920
So my question to you is this. Now that companies make such public displays of game sales and sales data for gaming-related products are so easy to locate, is liking a product enough?

2514
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:48,920
I am always willing to speak well for titles I enjoy, never to the exclusion of others, whenever the topic arises, but is there something else that can be done to improve the image of products such as Super Mario 3D World, which will likely have its spectacular reviews overshadowed by being one of the lowest-selling 3D Mario titles ever?

2515
02:41:50,920 --> 02:41:51,920
Was that it?

2516
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:57,920
Thank you for the entertainment you provide each week, and, um, Daniel.

2517
02:41:58,920 --> 02:41:59,920
Because I don't say last names on there.

2518
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:02,920
I think that was a good email, and thank you for that.

2519
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:04,920
And thank you for your masterful grammar.

2520
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:08,920
Sales shouldn't matter to your enjoyment of the game.

2521
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:10,920
No, it shouldn't.

2522
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:13,920
Oh for fuck's sake, I like Xanadu.

2523
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:21,920
Haven't we talked about this on a previous show as well? There's those cult games that maybe not everybody necessarily played, but you love.

2524
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:27,920
Like I talked about, there's a great card game called Cultcept that's like Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering. Love those games.

2525
02:42:28,920 --> 02:42:34,920
But they don't sell beans here. In fact, I think they didn't even come out with a 3DS version here because those games didn't sell very well, which was a tragedy.

2526
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:38,920
But yeah, you should like what you're gonna like, no matter what.

2527
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:40,920
There should be no shame in your game.

2528
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:41,920
Yeah.

2529
02:42:42,920 --> 02:42:51,920
You know, I love bad movies better than some of the top rated Oscar winning movies ever. I picked up Barbarella recently and I fucking love that movie because Jane Fonda was hot, sorry.

2530
02:42:52,920 --> 02:43:02,920
But, um, but I mean, it shouldn't be a guilty pleasure. It should just be a pleasure. And if you love it, fucking love it.

2531
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:09,920
It doesn't matter how well or how niche or how many copies is sold or anything. Just like what you like.

2532
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:19,920
Um, I think you're right. I think there's a lot of, um, well, well, it's, it's the whole thing about some people feel that theirs has to be the best, that theirs is better than everybody else.

2533
02:43:20,920 --> 02:43:21,920
It's that whole fanboyism.

2534
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:23,920
That's awesome Unicorn.

2535
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:25,920
Oh yeah, in the chat?

2536
02:43:26,920 --> 02:43:29,920
I love you awesome Unicorn because I also read grammar and etymology books for fun.

2537
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:32,920
You should change your nick to awesome emailing Unicorn.

2538
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:40,920
Um, what was I going to say? Um, ah, you made me lose my tangent with that. Uh, lose my thought.

2539
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:44,920
Um, Barbarella Psychadela.

2540
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:50,920
But people, people should play whatever they, they want and like it. And oh yeah, the fanboyism.

2541
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:57,920
People will use sales figures and wield it as a weapon as something like, you know, look at, look at what's going on with PlayStation four and Xbox one.

2542
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:06,920
They're both selling well, but still the fanboys are going to say, oh well, but it's because the number of regions this is selling in and it's because of, you know, such and such.

2543
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:14,920
And to be fair, we've asked those same questions on the show, but that's because we know there's spin going into this from Microsoft and Sony.

2544
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:20,920
And we are kind of curious like which one is, is, is selling a little better, but that doesn't make the other system worse necessarily.

2545
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:29,920
I'm a Wii U owner. I like my Wii U an awful lot, even though I didn't necessarily care for the wonderful 101 and I'm going to hear shit about that nonstop this week.

2546
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:39,920
But I love Mario 3D World. It is one of my top five games of the year for sure. Um, and I, I know Nintendo is going to put out some great stuff for it in 2014.

2547
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:45,920
And there are more reasons to buy a Wii U right now than there are to buy a PlayStation four or Xbox one.

2548
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:53,920
Will that be the same story in 2014? That's what I'm a little worried about for Nintendo's sake, but 3DS will keep them afloat.

2549
02:44:54,920 --> 02:45:00,920
And you know what? Like whatever you're going to like. There's lots of great games to justify a Wii, excuse me, justify a Wii U purchase.

2550
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:04,920
Love is not wrong, but it can sometimes be really gross and sticky.

2551
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:08,920
All right. Uh, is that it?

2552
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:12,920
Yerp. That is it for emails. Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

2553
02:45:12,920 --> 02:45:19,920
And by the way, I would like to go back and still thank NARP for the email. Thank you for being honest with us and making your opinion known.

2554
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:21,920
I said thank you for that email as well, didn't I?

2555
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:25,920
But I didn't say thank you and I'm saying thank you so that he doesn't think I'm a total bitch. I am only a 95% bitch.

2556
02:45:26,920 --> 02:45:29,920
Thank you to Generate Johnny too, because I don't think we thanked him for the email either.

2557
02:45:30,920 --> 02:45:32,920
Thank you. And thank you unicorn friend with the great grammar.

2558
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:37,920
All right. Thank you to everybody who takes the time out of the week to say hello to us. We appreciate it.

2559
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:41,920
And thank you to anybody else who loves Xanadu and Barbarella because those are the two best movies ever.

2560
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:43,920
Uh, no.

2561
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:48,920
You watched them at my Bachelorette party when we were eating jello shots.

2562
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:50,920
What is this fuckery?

2563
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:52,920
And it was awesome because I fucking love those movies.

2564
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:56,920
Of course, then again, I love Showgirls and that's my Halloween tradition is to watch Showgirls.

2565
02:45:57,920 --> 02:46:00,920
Which we did at my house and drank wine and watched Showgirls and it was great.

2566
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:03,920
And Miss Monet was with us. Is she a gamer? Because we need to get her on the show. I don't think she is.

2567
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:05,920
But we should have her on the show anyway.

2568
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:09,920
We should. She can teach a pole dancing class during the show. Our friend Monet is a pole dancer.

2569
02:46:10,920 --> 02:46:14,920
I used to work with Monet, which I knew Monet before. I knew Rob and I knew Monet separately.

2570
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:19,920
And then I found out that they knew each other. It's like my circle of Rob.

2571
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:24,920
Because there's Kat and you guys know Mystique.

2572
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:30,920
Through my, for my birthday party last year, Monet had a pole dancing class.

2573
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:34,920
We talked about this in Hoard House because Extefer came to the pole dancing class and he was really good at it.

2574
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:41,920
And then like this was so random. Apparently him and Monet ran into each other at like a postal service concert and they remembered each other.

2575
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:43,920
The world is such a small funny place sometimes.

2576
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:48,920
It is. But no, there was mention on my Facebook about doing a Cards Against Humanity session.

2577
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:50,920
Good times. Alright.

2578
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:53,920
Because I've been getting my 12 days of Cards Against Humanity.

2579
02:46:54,920 --> 02:46:57,920
Alright. This is too much talking about people that our listeners don't know. So we need to get into the effort.

2580
02:46:58,920 --> 02:46:59,920
We need to introduce our listeners to these people.

2581
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:01,920
We need to get into the FUs of the Week.

2582
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:18,920
Our Sakura, FUs of the Week.

2583
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:23,920
Um, I'm good. FU to the sick. FU to the plague.

2584
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:26,920
I will follow her because I have the exact same FU.

2585
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:30,920
FU to the fact that I got sick, especially when I had a weekend where I actually had a bunch of stuff planned.

2586
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:35,920
I was supposed to go wine tasting with friends this weekend who drove up from out of town and I couldn't fucking go.

2587
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:40,920
But they did the most adorable thing for me and I just love friends.

2588
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:42,920
Hugs and kisses if you guys are out there listening.

2589
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:50,920
And I was supposed to go to a big holiday party with some of my friends here locally and that was supposed to be Friday night.

2590
02:47:51,920 --> 02:47:54,920
Couldn't go because I was sick and it's rude to go to a dinner party when you're sick and cough on all the food.

2591
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:58,920
So, boo! Anyhow, uh, Loki?

2592
02:47:59,920 --> 02:48:06,920
I'm just FU'd to the fact that I still have to heal up for a while before I can actually eat real food.

2593
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:12,920
Everybody's giving FUs tonight to conditions. It's a theme tonight.

2594
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:19,920
And why not? Let's give an FU to Volition and Deep Silver for their fucking broken ass game.

2595
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:21,920
Because I would like to play that.

2596
02:48:22,920 --> 02:48:23,920
Oh, I have another FU.

2597
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:25,920
And it goes to you and Victoria.

2598
02:48:26,920 --> 02:48:27,920
Hey, FU.

2599
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:29,920
For Frivolo.

2600
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:31,920
Oh, it's great wine, isn't it?

2601
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:33,920
Because I bought a bottle and normally I'm not a sweet wine person.

2602
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:37,920
As I describe this to Victoria, it tastes like angels pissed in my cup.

2603
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:39,920
It was amazing.

2604
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:44,920
Frivolo's really good. That winery should pay me money for that endorsement.

2605
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:48,920
For the record, don't buy it at Whole Foods. Go to Total Wine because it's four bucks cheaper.

2606
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:51,920
Or just go to the winery. It's not far. Well, if you live here.

2607
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:54,920
I've never, you've never taken me. You need to take me, Rob, next time you go.

2608
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:59,920
Alright, let's see. What else do I want to say?

2609
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:01,920
We've got a couple more stories for you guys.

2610
02:49:02,920 --> 02:49:04,920
And then Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.

2611
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:08,920
And our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio. Although, I've got to admit, I'm a little bit worried.

2612
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:10,920
Bobby didn't have a single caller tonight on his show.

2613
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:14,920
Are we going to get people to call into OrangeLawnsRadio? We shall see.

2614
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:17,920
Coming up in a moment. But first, some quick stories here. Loki.

2615
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:33,920
So the Oculus Rift is moving along. They just received 75 million dollars in funding from the venture capital firm Andressen Horowitz led by, I guess that was it, Mark Anderson.

2616
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:40,920
Why does it seem like there's too many, or Andresen? There's too many letters in these words.

2617
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:42,920
It's like they have extra E's in there.

2618
02:49:42,920 --> 02:49:52,920
Anyways, and he's the founder of Netscape. Man, I remember Netscape. That was the browser to go to before Firefox.

2619
02:49:53,920 --> 02:49:56,920
It was. Netscape was the bomb. Dial into Prodigy, then fire up Netscape.

2620
02:49:57,920 --> 02:50:00,920
You know what we used to call it back when I was on AOL because there was a big rivalry?

2621
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:04,920
No, no. Prodigy, I mean. We called it Buttigy. For some reason we called it Buttigy.

2622
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:06,920
That doesn't even make sense.

2623
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:09,920
I know it didn't. And Netscape, by the way, was Nadscrape.

2624
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:11,920
Oh, I always heard Nutscrape.

2625
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:18,920
My first website was designed in Netscape. That shit was the bomb.

2626
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:28,920
So anyways, apparently they liked what they saw, and I'm sure 75 million dollars in funding can only help.

2627
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:35,920
They've already secured, I guess, previously 16 million dollars in the first round of funding in June.

2628
02:50:35,920 --> 02:50:41,920
I'm very curious to see what happens. Hopefully one day I will have an Oculus Rift myself.

2629
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:53,920
Getting closer. Getting closer to this total immersion future or something.

2630
02:50:54,920 --> 02:51:00,920
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, on Prodigy we just called AOL AOL because that was insulting enough.

2631
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:03,920
You know, I remember AOL when it was DOS.

2632
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:08,920
I remember when it was free. Because they kept sending you those 30 day trials.

2633
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:14,920
No, I remember having a phished account. I didn't phish it either.

2634
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:23,920
I remember when AOL was Quantum Link on the Commodore 64, and I used to dial into BBS's on my 300 baud modem.

2635
02:51:24,920 --> 02:51:26,920
It's hardcore, bitches. Hardcore.

2636
02:51:26,920 --> 02:51:31,920
You know, I still have my same, when they went to where you could have your free accounts.

2637
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:38,920
I actually still have the same username on my AIM from that account. It's DarkSakura.

2638
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:40,920
But I hide so no one can find me.

2639
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:43,920
I was going to say, wait a minute, now you're going to get tons of AOL Instant Messages.

2640
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:45,920
Who uses Instant Messenger anymore?

2641
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:48,920
Me and Becky and Victoria and a few people.

2642
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:52,920
Most of the people I've been friends with from my old AOL days.

2643
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:58,920
I didn't use Facebook Messenger either. I have a messenger that I prefer, but even then I only talk to like two people on it.

2644
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:04,920
I only keep AIM up because there's maybe like a handful of people. And sometimes some of my friends from Alabama are on it.

2645
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:07,920
It's all text messages now. It's kind of where people are.

2646
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:09,920
Yeah, but it's easier to type.

2647
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:12,920
Yeah, I understand. Alright, one more story for you guys.

2648
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:20,920
And don't read too much into this, but it's very exciting to know that Nintendo has renewed the trademark for Metroid Prime.

2649
02:52:20,920 --> 02:52:26,920
And a lot of people are doing, you know, shaking and crying because, ooh, this means there's going to be a new Metroid Prime on Wii U.

2650
02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:28,920
Well, there might be. You never know.

2651
02:52:29,920 --> 02:52:34,920
I mean, it would certainly make a lot of sense for Retro to go and do another Metroid Prime game for the Wii U.

2652
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:38,920
But we do know that the trademark was renewed on August 13, 2013.

2653
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:42,920
Probably just to protect, you know, the games that already exist.

2654
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:45,920
Because you know Nintendo loves to package up its old shit eventually.

2655
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:51,920
And on the next Nintendo console, we'll probably have GameCube games and Wii U games, or excuse me, Wii games downloadable.

2656
02:52:52,920 --> 02:52:55,920
So, you know, they just want to keep that trademark out there for sure.

2657
02:52:56,920 --> 02:52:58,920
But wouldn't it be nice to have another Metroid Prime game?

2658
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:02,920
Maybe that will be their ace in the hole at E3. We'll see.

2659
02:53:04,920 --> 02:53:08,920
They've got to somehow undo what Metroid does.

2660
02:53:09,920 --> 02:53:12,920
What was, I don't even remember the name of it now. Zero, not Zero Mission. That game was good.

2661
02:53:12,920 --> 02:53:16,920
I don't know what game was good. Metroid, what was the Team Ninja game? The Other M.

2662
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:20,920
Even though I didn't hate Metroid Other M. I didn't think it was as bad as a lot of people do.

2663
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:25,920
But it definitely felt like it was a different company's game, not a Nintendo game.

2664
02:53:26,920 --> 02:53:28,920
Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line.

2665
02:53:29,920 --> 02:53:33,920
It's open. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

2666
02:53:34,920 --> 02:53:35,920
You can give us a call right now if you'd like.

2667
02:53:36,920 --> 02:53:40,920
If there's anything you want to share or talk about maybe that we didn't bring up or something we did bring up, who knows.

2668
02:53:40,920 --> 02:53:43,920
Give us a call and we will talk about it.

2669
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:50,920
In the meantime, I'm going to go to Twitter Topics and see if Loki has any last minute stories or Dark Sakura. Who knows?

2670
02:53:51,920 --> 02:53:52,920
Nope.

2671
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:55,920
No, I don't really have anything at the moment.

2672
02:53:56,920 --> 02:54:00,920
Alright, well good thing the phone is ringing and we can actually go to some calls. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2673
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:04,920
The only one with the fastest internet finger in the whole wide internet chat. It's Rama.

2674
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:07,920
You're very good at this Rama. What's on your mind, buddy?

2675
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:12,920
I do try. There are some topics I do want to cover real quick and I've got to be on my merry little way.

2676
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:24,920
See, I feel with Loki with the whole dentist thing because once I went to... I had my three impacted teeth pulled out before I had to do an eight hour shift at work.

2677
02:54:25,920 --> 02:54:26,920
Oh, God.

2678
02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:33,920
I'm thinking, okay, get it done. Drop off the meds. Go to work. It won't be that big of a deal.

2679
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:45,920
Twenty minutes into my shift, I'm like, it hurts. It hurts. Take my break. Grab the meds. I was pretty much floating on cloud nine for the next eight hours after that.

2680
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:54,920
Oh my. How did you even work a shift on those? I can't believe you didn't just somehow get the day off or something. I don't know.

2681
02:54:55,920 --> 02:55:05,920
I have a high tolerance for pain. There was that time that I dislocated my knee and they gave me Tylenol 3. They gave me a week prescription. I only needed it for one day.

2682
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:19,920
Let's see. The whole YouTube debacle about them flagging videos. That's okay. I understand. I feel those users pains because some of my videos get flagged as well.

2683
02:55:20,920 --> 02:55:30,920
Some of our OLR episodes that have been posted on YouTube are getting flagged and it's making me question if we should continue to do it, to be honest, because it was all a kind of experiment anyway.

2684
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:37,920
But there's been a couple people that have been very vocal about their support of the YouTube posting, so I am trying to stick it out for them.

2685
02:55:38,920 --> 02:55:44,920
It's so very nice that they welcome us in open arms. Hey, you fucking stole that shit. Did you make that?

2686
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:48,920
That's how I feel, but whatever. Anyway, sorry, Rama.

2687
02:55:49,920 --> 02:56:01,920
It's cool. It's cool because the issue is with my videos, the Japanese come to make the albums of Sony, EMI, and them.

2688
02:56:02,920 --> 02:56:12,920
They will have the videos flagged because us videographers who record masquerades, they realize we didn't get permission to use their music in the video.

2689
02:56:12,920 --> 02:56:20,920
And I'm like, I didn't put the song in there. It was part of the skit. It was part of the musical or whatever.

2690
02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:27,920
And I just put back, under fair use, leave me alone please. Worst case scenario, some countries can't see my videos.

2691
02:56:28,920 --> 02:56:31,920
Yeah. Still, that's so irritating to even have to go through that, you know?

2692
02:56:31,920 --> 02:56:47,920
The whole 38 Studios bid? I'll tell you what. I will give 38 Studios fair value for all their franchises. $20. I believe I'm being more than fair.

2693
02:56:48,920 --> 02:56:54,920
That's not even the price of the game. Well, maybe it is now actually. I could be wrong. It could be the price of the game now.

2694
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:56,920
Exactly!

2695
02:56:57,920 --> 02:57:07,920
I'm just thinking there's not a lot of call out there for a sequel to Kingdoms of Amalur. Although, I know some people really liked it. It's not like I heard nothing. It's not like it was a crap game. It was decent from what I hear.

2696
02:57:08,920 --> 02:57:13,920
So I am. I'm actually kind of surprised no one wants the sequel rights, but I don't know. Whatever.

2697
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:15,920
It's weird.

2698
02:57:16,920 --> 02:57:22,920
Yeah. And last thing before I get out of here. I am returning to my Pokémon roots.

2699
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:25,920
Oh, you're going back to red and blue? What are you doing?

2700
02:57:26,920 --> 02:57:28,920
I'm playing the game again. I picked up a copy of Y.

2701
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:33,920
You know what? The new 3DS games are really good. Are you having fun with it so far?

2702
02:57:34,920 --> 02:57:40,920
I don't know. It's still sealed. I told myself I am not unwrapping Y till I finish A Link Between Worlds.

2703
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:46,920
That's fair. Because I was going to say, if you're going to sit there with an unopened copy of the game, I will sic Shana Linko on you.

2704
02:57:47,920 --> 02:57:48,920
Uh-uh.

2705
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:55,920
By the way, I'm fairly certain that Dan's gifting me that for a holiday mess. I'm getting X.

2706
02:57:56,920 --> 02:57:57,920
I told him I wanted X.

2707
02:57:58,920 --> 02:58:00,920
So you'll have somebody to trade Pokémans with.

2708
02:58:01,920 --> 02:58:09,920
I only bought the game for one reason. Toys R Us had it on sale last week or last for 20 bucks. I got Best Buy at a price match it.

2709
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:11,920
Here you go. It's a good deal. It's a steal for that game.

2710
02:58:12,920 --> 02:58:14,920
That's what I did with my Mass Effect 3. Got it for 10 bucks cheaper.

2711
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:16,920
Why not?

2712
02:58:16,920 --> 02:58:21,920
And then everyone on my Facebook is like, can I get it for X? Can I get it for X? I'm like, I don't know. Take it in.

2713
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:29,920
Ask them. They might be nice. Couple people have said, Best Buy. I was able to price match you for X as well because they're practically the same game.

2714
02:58:30,920 --> 02:58:31,920
Yeah, they are the same game. Pretty much.

2715
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:34,920
All right, Robin. Thanks so much for the call. Appreciate it.

2716
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:36,920
No problem, dude.

2717
02:58:37,920 --> 02:58:38,920
Take care. An Anime Jam session. Everybody listen Tuesday nights.

2718
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:40,920
Oh yeah, one more thing before I get out of here.

2719
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:48,920
Next week, I do believe is the 24th for our show. That's going to be our final show of the holiday before we take a break.

2720
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:56,920
We will be doing the Anime Jam session. We're getting crunked Christmas Eve special.

2721
02:58:57,920 --> 02:59:00,920
You guys are going live on Christmas Eve? That's impressive. You guys are hardcore.

2722
02:59:00,920 --> 02:59:10,920
It's because we'd rather get drunk with our friends and guests than our own families because if we're with our families, we're going to drink anyway.

2723
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:18,920
I love it. Unfortunately, I have plans with my own family on Christmas Eve, but if I get back in time, I'll join you all for a round.

2724
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:21,920
I'm probably going to have to drink to make it through our Christmas Eve.

2725
02:59:22,920 --> 02:59:23,920
I know, right? I know, right? All right.

2726
02:59:24,920 --> 02:59:28,920
You know what? Spend Christmas with your family. Spend Christmas with the drunken bastards of Anime Jam session.

2727
02:59:28,920 --> 02:59:34,920
I love it. I love it. We'll have a great show, but you still have one more show before that because this week coming up is the 17th.

2728
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:39,920
This week, we have a lot of stuff coming up and then that following week, all bets are off.

2729
02:59:40,920 --> 02:59:47,920
All bets are off. You know what? This week is the Hoard House Holiday Special and I'm going to tell you, it's a doozy. Hold on to your butts.

2730
02:59:48,920 --> 02:59:52,920
Well, I have one thing to say about that. May the fierce be with you.

2731
02:59:53,920 --> 02:59:55,920
Okay. All right. Talk to you later.

2732
02:59:56,920 --> 02:59:57,920
All right. Bye.

2733
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:02,920
Have a good day. All right. Actually, wait. Rama doesn't like Beyoncé. Oh, well.

2734
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:05,920
1877 Game O.L.R.

2735
03:00:06,920 --> 03:00:07,920
May the Jesus be with you.

2736
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:15,920
Or use your name on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word. Again, that's 1877 Game O.L.R. or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

2737
03:00:16,920 --> 03:00:18,920
Let's go to the phones. I think we have another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2738
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:20,920
This is Reginator.

2739
03:00:21,920 --> 03:00:22,920
Hey, Reginator. How you doing?

2740
03:00:23,920 --> 03:00:24,920
Pretty good.

2741
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:40,920
Well, two things. I was going to do kind of a rant about the whole YouTube group. Since that's going to take a little while, I just want to get the quick thing out of the way.

2742
03:00:41,920 --> 03:00:47,920
Since I'm feeling a little generous, I'm going to do a little game giveaway. A Steam game.

2743
03:00:48,920 --> 03:01:03,920
Yeah. In fact, this weekend, since it was a Steam sale on DinoDA, where the game was basically $2 for a single copy or four-pack for $6, I can't figure what the hell.

2744
03:01:04,920 --> 03:01:07,920
Pick up the four-pack, keep a copy for myself, giveaway dollars.

2745
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:10,920
He's Santinator tonight. Tonight he's Santinator.

2746
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:20,920
So, I can't figure what the hell. Giveaway is one of the copies of the game tonight on O.R.

2747
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:36,920
And what we'll do is, well, I'm going to ask a person directly in chance that way you guys don't get an unfair advantage because of the delay.

2748
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:48,920
And the first person that answers the question directly, go ahead and shout the answer out in text in chat.

2749
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:51,920
And we'll get the game.

2750
03:01:52,920 --> 03:01:54,920
Alright. Then you post that question in chat.

2751
03:01:55,920 --> 03:01:56,920
And I'm posting it right now.

2752
03:01:57,920 --> 03:02:05,920
Alright. Giveaway question. On Steam and according to record, what is my most played game in my total play time? Please list the game's full correct title.

2753
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:12,920
I'm going to let the chatters have it, but I'm almost positive I know what it is. Does it have to do with cards?

2754
03:02:15,920 --> 03:02:16,920
I can't say.

2755
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:19,920
Alright. I think it does. There's your hint.

2756
03:02:20,920 --> 03:02:28,920
So, you wanted to rant a little bit on the YouTube thing. Now, I'm going to ask you to try to keep it a little bit concise because we do want to end the show at a reasonable hour.

2757
03:02:29,920 --> 03:02:30,920
But what's your thoughts on the YouTube thing?

2758
03:02:30,920 --> 03:02:42,920
Alright. Here's the thing. On one hand, I know that companies be it Nintendo or Valve or Microsoft, whoever, yeah, they would like to protect their IPs.

2759
03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:55,920
That's understandable. But at the same time, you know, fans be it Bobby Blackwell, yourself, me, whoever, we like these games.

2760
03:02:56,920 --> 03:03:02,920
We want to support games. And we want to promote the games.

2761
03:03:03,920 --> 03:03:16,920
What we do is show off these games. And we're effectively giving these games free publicity. We're doing PR for these games.

2762
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:26,920
And the game manufacturers are not paying us one representative for this promotion.

2763
03:03:26,920 --> 03:03:36,920
Let me ask you this. I'm going to interrupt you real quick just to ask a tough question because, you know, yes, we're giving the games free publicity, but doesn't a game maker have a right to say, I don't want that publicity?

2764
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:52,920
No, that's one way of looking at it. I didn't look at it that way or consider it. But at the same time, I can't figure out why a company would want free publicity for the game.

2765
03:03:52,920 --> 03:04:01,920
Because I already mentioned that assuming that the game isn't crap, you know, they want publicity for the games because usually they'll garner extra sales.

2766
03:04:01,920 --> 03:04:16,920
Like Casey Point, earlier this year, Bobby Blackwell on Twitch, he had showed off Sacred Citadel, which is the go forth and conquer game.

2767
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:29,920
And I saw the stream and I liked the game, bought the game. So what was it, Deep Silver that put the game out? They made $15 off the game because of that stream.

2768
03:04:29,920 --> 03:04:37,920
So, I mean, but that is a testimony to when it works. But, you know, so I guess a company does have the right to say they don't want to do it.

2769
03:04:38,920 --> 03:04:44,920
But the thing that really irks me about the whole thing, Raginator, are the people, I mean, if the gaming company puts in the injunction, that's one thing.

2770
03:04:45,920 --> 03:04:50,920
Fine. Nintendo doesn't want their games to have monetized YouTubes or they want the money or whatever. Fine. That's their prerogative.

2771
03:04:50,920 --> 03:04:58,920
But it's when you have these other websites like ForGamer or Machinima or whatever, and they're the ones that I get content ID matched with.

2772
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:08,920
That's not right because that wasn't their, it wasn't their stuff to content match in the first place. It wasn't their game. You know what I mean?

2773
03:05:09,920 --> 03:05:16,920
Yeah. All right. Raginator, I got to let you go. Let us know, though, in chat who ends up winning that code and we will talk to you later.

2774
03:05:17,920 --> 03:05:18,920
All right. Have a nice night.

2775
03:05:19,920 --> 03:05:26,920
You too. All right. 1-877. I always love the generosity of the listeners, too, to be giving away codes and stuff like that. Good luck.

2776
03:05:27,920 --> 03:05:32,920
Although, I kind of think Dark Tetsuya said what I would have said, so I kind of think he's going to win it, but we'll see.

2777
03:05:33,920 --> 03:05:37,920
1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call.

2778
03:05:37,920 --> 03:05:46,920
Let's see. Going to some of the tweets that we got tonight. Retertainment sent us a tweet that we did touch on earlier in the show, but just to mention it again.

2779
03:05:47,920 --> 03:05:53,920
The Read Only Memories Kickstarter got funded. Yay! And I noticed MidBoss Games even retweeted our tweet that we were going live tonight.

2780
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:58,920
So they're supporting us just like we supported. You guys rule! You guys rule.

2781
03:05:59,920 --> 03:06:00,920
I'm feeling the love.

2782
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:08,920
I am feeling the love. Just you wait for GamerX, too. The whole lot of you are getting glomped. Right, DarkSakura?

2783
03:06:09,920 --> 03:06:10,920
If I get to go.

2784
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:13,920
All right, you will. All right. We'll make it work out.

2785
03:06:14,920 --> 03:06:16,920
So, Rob, you have to cosplay with me.

2786
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:22,920
Oh, God. Okay. If I lose 20 pounds, then I will cosplay with you.

2787
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:25,920
That's not going to happen.

2788
03:06:26,920 --> 03:06:27,920
Fuck you!

2789
03:06:28,920 --> 03:06:30,920
I had to go there. No. Rob.

2790
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:32,920
Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery.

2791
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:37,920
No. It can happen, but I would invite you to go to the gym with me.

2792
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:39,920
You know I go to the other gym.

2793
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:41,920
I know you do, but I can get you into my gym.

2794
03:06:42,920 --> 03:06:46,920
All right, anyway. We'll talk later about that. Meanwhile, we got some tweets.

2795
03:06:47,920 --> 03:06:50,920
Trust me, if my fat ass could lose 20 pounds, you could do it easy.

2796
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:53,920
No fat shaming. We shouldn't fat shame ourselves.

2797
03:06:54,920 --> 03:06:55,920
No, but I can say I'm fat if I want to.

2798
03:06:55,920 --> 03:06:56,920
No, but I saw that video this week, but anyway.

2799
03:06:57,920 --> 03:06:58,920
You know what?

2800
03:06:59,920 --> 03:07:04,920
I just, I feel for health reasons, I feel, I know I can be better, have a better body than the one I'm at.

2801
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:07,920
You know what? As long as you love you.

2802
03:07:08,920 --> 03:07:10,920
I know I can do, I do love me, but I know I can do better.

2803
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:12,920
All right, anyway.

2804
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:15,920
Moving on. Awkward talk!

2805
03:07:16,920 --> 03:07:17,920
Moving on. We have some tweets.

2806
03:07:17,920 --> 03:07:18,920
We have some tweets.

2807
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:26,920
Guy trollingly applies to a college football coaching job, citing his years of Madden and NCAAF playing.

2808
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:34,920
Do you think that we would be eligible for a job at a gaming company just because we did this podcast?

2809
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:39,920
I will actually, I will say, and I think I've talked about this on the show.

2810
03:07:40,920 --> 03:07:44,920
I'm not going to tell you who, but twice I've applied for positions with gaming companies.

2811
03:07:44,920 --> 03:07:53,920
One of them I actually was really close with and I decided to, because I would have had to relocate and I would have had to stop doing the show and everything else.

2812
03:07:54,920 --> 03:07:55,920
I decided to not go forward with it.

2813
03:07:56,920 --> 03:07:58,920
And I'm not going to tell you who it was, but you guys know I am a corporate teacher.

2814
03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:00,920
That's what I do during the day.

2815
03:08:01,920 --> 03:08:02,920
It was a corporate teaching job with a video game company.

2816
03:08:03,920 --> 03:08:04,920
That's cool.

2817
03:08:05,920 --> 03:08:06,920
And it would have been really cool.

2818
03:08:07,920 --> 03:08:11,920
And it was just the relocation kind of like, I couldn't do it because of where they wanted me to go, you know, would have been tough.

2819
03:08:11,920 --> 03:08:21,920
But, um, yeah, so, um, but yeah, I mean like, you know, but, but does the fact that we do a podcast mean we should work for video game companies?

2820
03:08:22,920 --> 03:08:23,920
Not necessarily.

2821
03:08:24,920 --> 03:08:27,920
Well, I mean, if it's graphic design than that for you, that's good.

2822
03:08:28,920 --> 03:08:32,920
Yeah, Loki does sales, you know, so, you know, maybe that type of stuff would be good for him.

2823
03:08:33,920 --> 03:08:36,920
I would love to do design for like digital manuals and that type of thing.

2824
03:08:36,920 --> 03:08:41,920
SSG 100 Matt says, I've cited OLR in a job interview once. Didn't get the job. Sorry to hear it.

2825
03:08:42,920 --> 03:08:48,920
I have had, I've used people for references though. Um, as, uh, as people have listed Orange Lawns Radio as job.

2826
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:51,920
Didn't you do that dark soccer? You put OLR down and me as a professional contact.

2827
03:08:52,920 --> 03:09:00,920
I put OLR down, um, well, you were already one of my references, but I put OLR down as a client for freelance design.

2828
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:02,920
And I put myself down as art director for VOG.

2829
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:05,920
I have used it as a example of management skills.

2830
03:09:06,920 --> 03:09:08,920
Doing this show and keeping you two in line. I'm just kidding.

2831
03:09:09,920 --> 03:09:11,920
We all, we all help each other out to be honest.

2832
03:09:12,920 --> 03:09:15,920
All right. Uh, let's see. I had one other tweet here I wanted to read.

2833
03:09:16,920 --> 03:09:25,920
Yes, it was from Eric RPG sent us a tweet and, uh, it was just a link over to a Kickstarter for Grapple Knight is another Kickstarter.

2834
03:09:26,920 --> 03:09:27,920
So I'm assuming this is a Kickstarter he's behind.

2835
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:33,920
It's a 2D platformer that pays tribute to the golden age of Super Nintendo.

2836
03:09:33,920 --> 03:09:39,920
Sounds good to me. There's a lot of these, uh, Grapple Knight is, uh, something he wanted to give a shout out for on Kickstarter.

2837
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:44,920
So check that out. Um, let's see. Just trying to see if there's any other tweets.

2838
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:51,920
Oh, I want to mention this. Uh, we're going to get her back on the show for sure at some point, but do you remember?

2839
03:09:52,920 --> 03:09:59,920
Yeah. Do you remember our buddy? She came on the show right after it was announced she was going to be on the tester three.

2840
03:09:59,920 --> 03:10:05,920
Our buddy Oscar was on the show. Now she was funny enough. We didn't know this. She called in just out of the blue.

2841
03:10:06,920 --> 03:10:08,920
We didn't arrange the interview or anything. She knew a listener of the shows.

2842
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:12,920
I hope Stan's still listening if he's out there. Thank you for hooking that up.

2843
03:10:13,920 --> 03:10:17,920
But, uh, she called into the show one night and it happened to be the week before she got kicked off the tester three.

2844
03:10:18,920 --> 03:10:21,920
Yes. She was very cool, but she was very cool. We had a lot of fun with her. We'll get this.

2845
03:10:21,920 --> 03:10:30,920
She's on the King of the Nerds season two. And I'm like, girl, I know you can't talk about if you won or lost the thing. I understand that.

2846
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:38,920
But I'm like, win or lose, you have been on the tester and King of the Nerds. You are the nerdiest reality show contestant of all time.

2847
03:10:39,920 --> 03:10:48,920
So anyway, I just thought that was hilarious that she's on that show now. So we'll have her back to talk about that, which sounds like Rama saying, fuck King of the Nerds.

2848
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:55,920
Well, he'll be really excited for that interview then. Retertainment says she's on actual TV. Yes. Crazy, huh?

2849
03:10:56,920 --> 03:11:00,920
So anyway, uh, let's see other stuff I wanted to mention.

2850
03:11:01,920 --> 03:11:11,920
Uh, Peaker Uno tweeted the show and said, I missed last week's topic, but one of my favorite TV programs was Nightmare, a virtual reality RPG game show in the nineties.

2851
03:11:12,920 --> 03:11:13,920
I remember that kind of.

2852
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:17,920
That's awesome. Anyhow, uh, I don't think we're getting any other calls.

2853
03:11:18,920 --> 03:11:21,920
So that's a little by, yeah, I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

2854
03:11:22,920 --> 03:11:26,920
I have one last bit of, uh, go ahead and then we'll close up shop for tonight. Um, so this is pretty exciting.

2855
03:11:27,920 --> 03:11:35,920
I've been actually waiting for this to happen. Duke Nukem 3d Megaton edition has now added steam workshop support and a level editor.

2856
03:11:36,920 --> 03:11:37,920
Wait, does it have multiplayer play yet online?

2857
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:44,920
Um, I'm assuming if it has the level, I'm surprised it doesn't fit already. But, uh, anyways, yeah, there's a bombshell announcement.

2858
03:11:44,920 --> 03:11:49,920
I could use 60 maps for download already and they're adding their own rating system and mini forum.

2859
03:11:50,920 --> 03:11:55,920
And the game's also 75% off until tomorrow, which means I'm going to buy that right now.

2860
03:11:56,920 --> 03:11:58,920
Oh my God. I just realized something. I have to check drunken robot pornography.

2861
03:11:59,920 --> 03:12:02,920
Why? See if they've updated because remember I've still been playing the alpha.

2862
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:05,920
That's right. Uh, me too with, um, uh, audio surf too.

2863
03:12:06,920 --> 03:12:09,920
There's been getting little updates here and there. So, uh,

2864
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:11,920
I've got my steam cards I can buy.

2865
03:12:12,920 --> 03:12:15,920
Yeah, I think by the game mean it's only $2 and 49 cents.

2866
03:12:16,920 --> 03:12:17,920
Is it really? It's only $2 and 49 cents.

2867
03:12:18,920 --> 03:12:19,920
Ooh, that's a good one. That's a good one.

2868
03:12:20,920 --> 03:12:23,920
All right. Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem 3d together, $3 and 74 cents.

2869
03:12:24,920 --> 03:12:28,920
Tempting, tempting. All right. Um, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry video.

2870
03:12:29,920 --> 03:12:32,920
Thank you guys so much for listening to us stay in here for the whole show, uh, the whole way through for us.

2871
03:12:33,920 --> 03:12:36,920
I hope we could entertain you during your day with our chatter about video games.

2872
03:12:36,920 --> 03:12:40,920
Um, wherever you're listening to us, whether you're here live Sunday night, just chilling with our show,

2873
03:12:41,920 --> 03:12:44,920
or, uh, if you're listening to us on your commute or at your work day on Monday, uh,

2874
03:12:45,920 --> 03:12:47,920
thank you so much for taking the time out to listen to Orange Laundry radio and supporting the show.

2875
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:53,920
Support independent broadcasting. There's so many hardworking people like us out there that do this just for the love of it.

2876
03:12:54,920 --> 03:12:56,920
Please go forth and download lots of indie podcasts.

2877
03:12:57,920 --> 03:13:01,920
Remember word of mouth is key to the success of this show because there's so many, uh,

2878
03:13:01,920 --> 03:13:07,920
so many of these big corporate podcasts that have much money in their pockets that can buy the promotion and so forth.

2879
03:13:08,920 --> 03:13:13,920
We can't do that. So all we ask if you enjoy the show, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word.

2880
03:13:14,920 --> 03:13:18,920
They're not as cute as us. No, they're not. They're not. We're very, super adorable. Absolutely.

2881
03:13:19,920 --> 03:13:24,920
We are the, we are the most prettiest. Um, thank you guys once again for checking out the show.

2882
03:13:24,920 --> 03:13:30,920
Uh, leave a nice review. If you wouldn't mind saying a nice word on iTunes reviews, that'd be great.

2883
03:13:31,920 --> 03:13:36,920
Or a Stitcher reviews are hugely helpful too. Uh, I directly attribute the increase we've had, uh,

2884
03:13:37,920 --> 03:13:40,920
in our exposure on Stitcher to those of you that taken the time to write the reviews. So thank you so much.

2885
03:13:41,920 --> 03:13:45,920
And, um, I don't know what else to say. Thank you guys again for, for listening.

2886
03:13:46,920 --> 03:13:49,920
You guys are great and have a great holiday season. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2887
03:13:50,920 --> 03:13:52,920
Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight.

2888
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:53,920
You have another game to play now.

2889
03:13:55,920 --> 03:13:56,920
What's that? Duke Nukem or?

2890
03:13:57,920 --> 03:13:59,920
Actually, it's two games. Duke Nukem and Shadow Warrior.

2891
03:14:00,920 --> 03:14:05,920
All right. We'll work on it. Uh, my final thought for tonight is I may just have to get that Grand Theft Auto 5 on sale.

2892
03:14:06,920 --> 03:14:09,920
I think Loki might have finally broke me. We'll see. Uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

2893
03:14:10,920 --> 03:14:13,920
It wouldn't let me, um, buy you a fractal on my Steam app, so I have to do it when I get home.

2894
03:14:14,920 --> 03:14:15,920
Aw, shucks.

2895
03:14:16,920 --> 03:14:17,920
But you're worth the $7.

2896
03:14:18,920 --> 03:14:19,920
That's always nice.

2897
03:14:19,920 --> 03:14:24,920
I love you more than Loki. He only spent $3 on you. I spent $7. Hi.

2898
03:14:25,920 --> 03:14:30,920
Wait, what? $3? I spent $3 on me? What are you talking about?

2899
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:35,920
See? I would have gotten you fractal if you didn't already have it.

2900
03:14:38,920 --> 03:14:41,920
Leave us reviews that are nice and sweet because we're cute.

2901
03:14:42,920 --> 03:14:43,920
That's right.

2902
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:47,920
Uh, to paraphrase, um, we're O.L.R. and we're pretty. How's that?

2903
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:52,920
Alright, well thank you guys again. And Bobby too. Have a wonderful week. Bobby is especially pretty.

2904
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:59,920
All the VOG shows, dammit. We're all pretty. And all the indie shows you listen to. I mean, there's lots of great ones out there.

2905
03:15:00,920 --> 03:15:04,920
I know a lot of you support various indie shows. I know a lot of you listen to the shows over on All Games.

2906
03:15:05,920 --> 03:15:12,920
They would love to have your support with Stitcher Reviews as well. I know a lot of you, maybe like Gamer Tag Radio and some of these shows that have been on, like, ages like we have.

2907
03:15:13,920 --> 03:15:14,920
They all appreciate the support.

2908
03:15:14,920 --> 03:15:20,920
By the way, I'm just throwing it out there. I'm actually planning on doing a Let's Draw series.

2909
03:15:21,920 --> 03:15:23,920
And what would that be? You just draw?

2910
03:15:24,920 --> 03:15:33,920
Well, pretty much. I get votes for a character that someone wants to see me draw and I will do one once a month and give it away as a freebie.

2911
03:15:34,920 --> 03:15:37,920
That'd be fun. Little community. Gather around.

2912
03:15:38,920 --> 03:15:42,920
So instead of a Let's Play, it's a Let's Draw. And I don't have to worry about people breathing on my shit.

2913
03:15:42,920 --> 03:15:46,920
She's just like Bob Ross, but they're bitchy little clouds.

2914
03:15:49,920 --> 03:15:53,920
You know what? Actually, you know what? That came up in my oil painting class last week?

2915
03:15:54,920 --> 03:15:57,920
I was like, I can't be like Bob Ross. My clouds are a little angrier than his.

2916
03:15:58,920 --> 03:16:01,920
And he's like, so are they fussy little clouds? I'm like, yes, they are. They're fussy.

2917
03:16:02,920 --> 03:16:09,920
All right. Well, we hope you and your bitchy little clouds have a wonderful week. We'll see you next week. Same bat time, same bat channel here at Orange Lounge Radio. Good night, everybody.
