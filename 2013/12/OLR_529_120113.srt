1
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:12,519
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,902
[SPEAKER_05]: We're officially on the road to the holiday season and the lovable Third Street Saints are joining in the festivities with new DLC.

3
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:23,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Also tonight, GamerX founder Matt Kahn joins us to talk about his Kickstarter for a Snatcher-inspired adventure game.

4
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:27,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Your questions, comments, calls on the show where every video gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge.

6
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:36,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:38,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said that.

9
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:44,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you did and I'm saying it again live on this December 1st, 2013, episode number 529.

10
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show.

11
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:55,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gamer lols, and who knows what else with my co-host Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that mean he said it dead and now he's undead?

13
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:00,117
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it out of turn is what he said.

14
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:00,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Fired!

15
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:01,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine, alright.

16
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:02,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah.

17
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:03,538
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

18
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:04,919
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we missed you last week.

19
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back.

20
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:08,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I was here last week because it was fucking loud.

21
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:09,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

22
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:13,143
[SPEAKER_13]: We went to this place called The Yard House, which we were discussing before.

23
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:16,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like super fancy pants, but a little fancy.

24
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I ate something incredibly non-kosher and it was delicious.

25
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:22,749
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a surf and turf burger without the bun.

26
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:24,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and happy Hanukkah, Jamie.

27
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:25,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy Hanukkah to me!

28
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:29,032
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the fifth night I will be lighting my candles when I return home.

29
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:32,454
[SPEAKER_04]: How did, uh, Hanukkah's giving, Hanukkah's giving or whatever Thanksgiving-ka?

30
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:34,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanksgiving-ka, yeah, so how did Thanksgiving-ka treat you?

31
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:43,642
[SPEAKER_13]: It was fucking loud too Um, okay, well we went, we went to, uh, have Thanksgiving dinner at, um, you remember Dan's buddy Adam, right?

32
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:52,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Mm-hmm Uh, we went over there and there were the kids and Dan's cousins and brought the kids too And there was a bunch of people and fucking sports ball I hate sports ball

33
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:54,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate sports ball.

34
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's DDR.

35
00:01:55,251 --> 00:02:01,839
[SPEAKER_13]: And I say it with extra southern accent because all I heard about yesterday was Alabama Auburn, no one Kerr.

36
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,121
[SPEAKER_04]: But you do love Tecmo Bowl, right?

37
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess.

38
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:07,846
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some sports ball you can tolerate, I know that.

39
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:08,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, some.

40
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,449
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to date a rugby player and that was pretty awesome.

41
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:16,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello as well to... Loki is here in studio.

42
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:17,633
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Techmaster Loki?

43
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:18,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing fine.

44
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:21,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to figure out where these phantom stain spots came from.

45
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:25,101
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like something dripped on my pizza sauce.

46
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:26,582
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not pizza sauce.

47
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:27,823
[SPEAKER_03]: It's grease.

48
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:30,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it must be for the breadsticks, but they're not that greasy.

49
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they are greasy, but they're not that greasy.

50
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:35,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't notice any grease dripping off of them.

51
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:40,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of Loki's, you know, Loki always brings an interesting dining selection to the show.

52
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:41,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's sometimes fast.

53
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:46,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's become a bit of a betting game amongst the live OLR listeners, what he brings to the show.

54
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:49,056
[SPEAKER_04]: So tonight he brought his, he goes to the pizza place.

55
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:49,817
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't get pizza.

56
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:52,758
[SPEAKER_04]: He gets just a mass of breadsticks.

57
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,139
[SPEAKER_04]: They are really good breadsticks.

58
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:57,561
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will say if you have round table pizza in your area and you've had the breadsticks, they are really good.

59
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:58,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to lie.

60
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably oil or something.

61
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:02,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

62
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:02,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

63
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:03,823
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cheese.

64
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:04,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheese or something.

65
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:05,844
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cheesy.

66
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:08,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It keeps Loki cheesy, y'all.

67
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:09,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not easy.

68
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:15,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us in studio, I know you heard him a minute ago, and he is back this week.

69
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:17,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to the voice of the show, Jason.

70
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:18,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It's me.

71
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:18,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Again.

72
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:19,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet again.

73
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:20,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how you doing, Jason?

74
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:20,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing good.

75
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:21,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

76
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Been a good couple of days.

77
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Been a good four-day weekend.

78
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a good Thanksgiving as well?

79
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're... I did Friendsgiving.

80
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:27,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

81
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:30,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Coworkers of mine invited me over, and there was about 20 of us.

82
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:34,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody that follows me on Twitter may have seen this story that I started to come up with.

83
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:43,123
[SPEAKER_05]: A Twitter, Apple, Google, and GitHub employee sat around the table, and I don't really have a joke to fill into the end of that, but I'm sure there's one in there somewhere.

84
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:44,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Some Silicon Valley...

85
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:46,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Friendsgiving is a lot of fun

86
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,490
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'm... I heard you got super drunk.

87
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:14,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little... Well, you must read my Twitter because I wrote some really stupid stuff last night while I was... No, no, no, no.

88
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Grandpa posted it on Facebook.

89
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:16,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

90
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:20,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know me and my alcohol tolerance of which I have none, right?

91
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:21,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I usually don't drink.

92
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm usually the sober one.

93
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:26,260
[SPEAKER_04]: But visiting Grandpa in the city, we were able to take cabs and all that stuff.

94
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I had seven drinks last night.

95
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,980
[SPEAKER_04]: and yeah, it was a lot of fun.

96
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good, I'm good, but I am feeling a little bit like if I'm dragging a little bit today, I blame that.

97
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:41,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I blame Friendsgiving with drinks.

98
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:42,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

99
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the new Zynga game?

100
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Friendsgiving with drinks?

101
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:47,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly, possibly.

102
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,416
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

103
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:19,444
[SPEAKER_04]: That actually has nothing to do with conventions, but it is kind of neat because it's inspired by an old, you know, we love old classic video games here at OLR.

104
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:23,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Show of hands, who remembers the old video game Snatcher?

105
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:24,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Who has Snatcher?

106
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,732
[SPEAKER_04]: If he's going to be, I have to ask him about GamerX.

107
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:46,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know about GamerX too.

108
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:48,155
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to ask some of those questions.

109
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:56,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will get to those questions and your questions live in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com in about 20 minutes or so.

110
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:58,624
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that.

111
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:00,345
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to get to a kickoff topic as well.

112
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:03,588
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's a little bit more of a serious note.

113
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:06,931
[SPEAKER_04]: This is housekeeping of sorts, IDK, what you want to call it.

114
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got to talk a little bit about last week.

115
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:13,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we had a great show last week.

116
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:14,622
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a lot of fun here on the show last week.

117
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:15,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't here.

118
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:16,403
[SPEAKER_13]: How could it be awesome?

119
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't our best ever, I'll be honest.

120
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:21,125
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, it couldn't have been our best.

121
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,546
[SPEAKER_13]: You need me to balance it out, huh?

122
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:32,730
[SPEAKER_04]: But we did get feedback from multiple sources on last week's show that maybe felt that some of the discussion we had last week might have been a little bit off.

123
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:40,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it is the show where every gamer has a voice, so I want to entertain some of this feedback and I want to kind of respond to it a little bit.

124
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:41,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, respectfully.

125
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:48,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna call this one out because it was publicly posted to our Facebook and by calling out I just mean I'm selecting it to read it on air.

126
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:49,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like, I'm calling you out!

127
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Back racks!

128
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Three o'clock!

129
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:51,381
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

130
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:53,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, because I do appreciate the feedback.

131
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:54,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

132
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:56,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to read this post that came to our Facebook.

133
00:06:56,424 --> 00:07:04,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Carla O, is the name on Facebook, and it says, uh, I think I might stop listening to the show if it becomes PlayStation-centric, which it's starting to seem that way.

134
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh,

135
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:07,391
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the comment.

136
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:14,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really trying to think, like, what in last week's show might have given the impression that we were PlayStation-centric?

137
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:16,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was really thinking about it, and I was like, you know what?

138
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:24,856
[SPEAKER_04]: In gaming culture as of late anyway, things have definitely seemed to be tilting in PlayStation's favor as a whole.

139
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at the big picture here, and I'm trying to think, why is that?

140
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:32,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's because Microsoft has been playing a little bit of a game of...

141
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,020
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

142
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Every Gamer Has a Voice

143
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is definitely a way I kind of feel in general.

144
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:27,865
[SPEAKER_04]: If we go back to 2006, the roles were almost reversed.

145
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:32,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, coming out of E3 that year, Sony was the laughing stock of the entire gaming industry.

146
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Giant enemy crabs, $599 US dollars, $599, like we all remember that, right?

147
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:46,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I've made this comparison on the show before, is that we're almost sitting in a place now where we're looking at like the complete flip of that.

148
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,081
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

149
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:20,781
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe that gamers should be able to once they buy the disc, the purchase is there.

150
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:27,270
[SPEAKER_04]: He did that systematic dismantling at E3 of everything the internet didn't like about Microsoft.

151
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:33,614
[SPEAKER_04]: and so that was an attack we haven't seen the likes of in a long time.

152
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:36,016
[SPEAKER_04]: So that made things very interesting.

153
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:36,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.

154
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:38,217
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even have to go back that far.

155
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:42,319
[SPEAKER_05]: We just have to go back two weeks ago where you cancelled your PS4 pre-order.

156
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,021
[SPEAKER_04]: True, but I don't necessarily blame Sony for that.

157
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:53,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I just necessarily blame, and I think this is the boat we're all in right now of, we're just not ready for this next generation of game yet.

158
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:55,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.

159
00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:58,083
[SPEAKER_04]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

160
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:05,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, personally, I look at what the PlayStation 4 has and what the Xbox One has and I say, eh, nothing there for me yet.

161
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:10,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan and I swore off system and phone launches.

162
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,513
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting my 5S at the end of the year instead of right when it came out.

163
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:19,796
[SPEAKER_10]: We're probably getting our PS4 in February.

164
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:25,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've pretty much decided that just because more stuff that we want to do is out on it and it fits in better with the things that we want to do.

165
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:26,559
[SPEAKER_10]: End of story.

166
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,923
[SPEAKER_10]: To tell you what train that I'm on, I'm on the TurboDuo train, 16-bit forever, hue cards, heck yeah.

167
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:37,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I wrote kind of a response along those lines.

168
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:39,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Carla wrote back and I do want to read this here.

169
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,374
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, but most of the negative criticism is focused on two out of those consoles.

170
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:49,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand everyone has their favorite console, but if the show focuses on all gaming platforms, it should reflect that in the show content.

171
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:55,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Lately, there has been a ton of negativity thrown at one console, and that is pretty much what I hear in every other podcast.

172
00:10:55,385 --> 00:11:00,328
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR was the exception, but not as of late, which makes me sad because I enjoy this show more than most.

173
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:01,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the reply.

174
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:02,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

175
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for engaging in respectful dialogue.

176
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love these types of conversations as opposed to what you used to see in the old YouTube comments.

177
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, you fucking fuck, right?

178
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:14,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really appreciate kind of the respectful dialogue there.

179
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:15,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

180
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:24,700
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as it goes, I can see where maybe last week, maybe kicking the Xbox the day after they launched maybe wasn't the most tactful thing to do.

181
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,241
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also kind of a realist view of where some people's heads are at.

182
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:33,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say this in general, and I'm going to come back to this theme a little bit later on tonight.

183
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:37,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like to think that we are fair to everybody.

184
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,304
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be good days for gaming companies.

185
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:41,124
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be bad days for gaming companies.

186
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:45,065
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're part of that voice out there on the internet that talks about that.

187
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:59,101
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know just like let's take Nintendo for an example we've talked a lot of Sony we've talked a lot of Microsoft we haven't talked a lot of Nintendo Nintendo absolutely has had their good days and their bad days and we've talked about you know we try to razz them both on this show for example bad days the swap note disabling what

188
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:28,852
[SPEAKER_04]: that was you know and that just feeds into the whole Nintendo you do not understand online that whole thing right but then on the good side of Nintendo dude Nintendo released two game of the year contenders on the same day in the new Mario 3D world and Zelda Link Between Worlds that's a very good thing I mean those are game of the year contenders granted it's going to be a rough ride at the top when you've got Bioshock Infinite and Last of Us also this year but let's not neglect that those are two rock solid games that came out on the same day that's good news

189
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:33,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and I could think of cases for Sony and Microsoft as well.

190
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:42,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to encourage the listeners, you know, continue to, if you feel like your voice is not being represented, by all means, speak up.

191
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:44,505
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to hear where you're coming from.

192
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:51,971
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think that, you know, maybe we're neglecting something about the Xbox One that needs to be brought to the forelight, please continue.

193
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring it up on the show.

194
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:56,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we've ever said to somebody, you know what?

195
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:57,773
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong in your opinion.

196
00:12:57,793 --> 00:12:59,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to think we haven't said that.

197
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:06,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we sometimes riff on each other and yell at each other a little bit and maybe have said that, but we don't really want to tell people they're wrong.

198
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:06,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

199
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:07,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right?

200
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:08,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

201
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:12,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about Mass Effect, but... You know what?

202
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:13,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

203
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:14,057
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to hell.

204
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:14,717
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong.

205
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:15,518
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong.

206
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,178
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't deny a fact.

207
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:18,038
[SPEAKER_13]: You are wrong on.

208
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,639
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot deny a fact.

209
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:30,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but anyway, I might be dragging this out way too much, but I just want to say, guys, again, we're here to present some other perspectives.

210
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:32,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes that's our perspective and sometimes that's your perspective.

211
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:40,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing I want to challenge our listeners to do, I don't think I got my thought out on this, is that, you know, sometimes in gaming we tend to live in this bubble.

212
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,325
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's the way you see it.

213
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:47,107
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying this particular listener is that way.

214
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:47,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying you.

215
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:53,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying in general, gamers, gaming, look at comments on websites and tell me you don't think this about some people.

216
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:58,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Some gamers tend to live in their little bubble and they can't really see outside that bubble.

217
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:01,735
[SPEAKER_04]: How could somebody possibly want an Xbox One?

218
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:07,098
[SPEAKER_04]: How could somebody possibly want to spend $100 extra on this system with this device you don't need?

219
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:07,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

220
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:11,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Look outside that bubble.

221
00:14:11,138 --> 00:14:12,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's a reason.

222
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's that game.

223
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:26,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you for me personally, next year is going to suck for my wallet because I'm going to have to buckle and get a PlayStation 4 when they release Final Fantasy XIV, the Elder Scrolls beta, the new Infamous looks really good.

224
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:27,672
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a lot of stuff on PlayStation.

225
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:29,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Then on Xbox 360, guess what?

226
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:33,537
[SPEAKER_04]: When they release a new Halo, when they release Quantum Break, I got to pick up an Xbox 360.

227
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,741
[SPEAKER_04]: When they release all that, I gotta get an Xbox One as well.

228
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So my wallet's gonna be hurting next year.

229
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just waiting for those games.

230
00:14:42,123 --> 00:14:42,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

231
00:14:43,424 --> 00:15:00,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to introduce our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com and I'm trying to look at what some of the chatters are saying here.

232
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:01,939
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been discussing physics.

233
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:05,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So on task, apparently.

234
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:09,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing talk about gigantic monitors and whatever is going on there.

235
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:15,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I said that I should be on NEC's payroll and someone asked if they still exist.

236
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:16,486
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we started talking about their...

237
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:17,967
[SPEAKER_04]: They made printers and stuff, right?

238
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:26,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but they made these great flat-screen CRT monitors that were perfect for doing color matching.

239
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:29,214
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it was almost like a print match.

240
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:30,015
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so great.

241
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:32,736
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, you can't really get a CRT monitor anymore.

242
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:37,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see, SJ100Matt says, I remember the beginning of Last Generation.

243
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:40,319
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR was accused of being anti-Sony, as a lot of internet was.

244
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Brad says, uh, talk about what you know.

245
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,102
[SPEAKER_04]: We bought the PlayStation 4 versus the Xbox One, so that is what we can talk about.

246
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:50,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're right, we can talk about our particular reasons and so forth.

247
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:59,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then, let's see, some folks in chat, some various people talking about kind of the whole Microsoft and what happened recently with some of the bans they were doing, which we're gonna get into a little later in the show.

248
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:02,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Loki, I, I, you know, again, you

249
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:03,989
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

250
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:28,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say that sweet, sweet PlayStation 4 is a great value for this holiday at a retail price of $399.

251
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,079
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find it... Okay, I just don't want to do that.

252
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm not on their payroll.

253
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wish I was.

254
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't understand how much that would be so awesome to have actual pay.

255
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:44,983
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but...

256
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,350
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

257
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:10,329
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

258
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:31,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you don't say anything, people are going to expect the worst, so that's kind of what it is.

259
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:45,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft did it at the beginning of the Xbox 360 launch, kept playing down how many systems were affected by the Red Ring of Death or whatever, and people didn't believe them.

260
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't believe you that a small percentage of them are being affected by it when I've had six.

261
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:50,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

262
00:17:52,528 --> 00:18:18,347
[SPEAKER_04]: It was ridiculous, so, I don't know, I think I'm harder than everybody And if I'm not, then I need to try harder You are, to be fair, you are pretty hard on everybody You said hard on Shut up, but, you know, it is kind of part of the reason I also see, you know, granted we had a lot of feedback to last week's show in that regard But I also get other feedback that's like, I live for Loki rants I am here for Loki rants, what pissed Loki off this week, I've gotta have a rant

263
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:20,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, there's that on both sides.

264
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's been things.

265
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it that way.

266
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:25,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see what we're going to get to tonight in tonight's show.

267
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:26,995
[SPEAKER_04]: But, again, I just wanted to respond.

268
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:32,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though I only read one comment there because it was something public on Facebook, I just wanted to say there was other, like, chatter.

269
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I hope, you know, again, if you feel like there's a point that wasn't addressed, please, by all means, email the show, mailbag at orangeontrade.com.

270
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:41,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You can post on Facebook as well, Twitter, and all that.

271
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,052
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you were out last week.

272
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:45,616
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been gaming on the past couple weeks?

273
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:59,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Final Fantasy XIV, which every time I've logged on, no one's been on, so whatever Really?

274
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:14,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm on a lot Well, it's during the day and you people have jobs I started my job, my contract work, so I'm very happy Actually, this is going to be a story, so maybe this will take the 10 minutes

275
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan's birthday was Friday, on Black Friday.

276
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:20,835
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were like, last week we need to do something really nice for Dan.

277
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:23,697
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was trying to get people who wanted to get in to buy Dan a present with me.

278
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:27,561
[SPEAKER_13]: And he had said, up and down, I don't want a download copy of Zelda.

279
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:31,585
[SPEAKER_13]: I want the physical copy, so I'm not going to get the package, blah, blah, blah.

280
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:32,506
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

281
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:47,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Me and Becky and our cousin-in-law Hannah and George and Amanda all got together and we got the money together to order Dan a red 3DS XL and I bought him Zelda.

282
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:48,176
[SPEAKER_13]: I went out and bought it.

283
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:54,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Turns out, while I'm sitting in the bank trying to get my business bank account set up so that it can work...

284
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan says, look what I bought.

285
00:19:57,603 --> 00:20:00,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Picture, gold, you know, 3DS.

286
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:03,651
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I call him, I go, you are so stupid.

287
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:08,739
[SPEAKER_13]: And this guy is like sitting next to me playing like Bejeweled on his phone and he's laughing his ass off.

288
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:10,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Because...

289
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:35,619
[SPEAKER_13]: and so anyway it ended up you know they just gave the monies for Dan to pay back what he paid on the thing and we kept a physical copy he gave the e-copy to George and I kind of thought like maybe you were gonna do something where you bought the Zelda one and then like you sold the code to somebody else who really wanted it or so I just kind of thought that's how things would go but I I like the way you guys did it for the record bones it actually was me because I was using Becky me in a subjective content and

290
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:56,469
[SPEAKER_13]: context so you never end with you never use I as a subject I mean as a object there's a grammar throwdown going on in our chat room anyway don't you dare step to me in my grammar alright moving on come on I will conjugate you to death

291
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:11,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, so as it turned out, George ended up picking up Fire Emblem for Dan, because Dan loves his Fire Emblem, and Dan's been playing... Crap.

292
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:12,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I just forgot it.

293
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:13,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Ace Attorney.

294
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,609
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been really into it and hasn't been sleeping because he's doing the damn cases.

295
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:20,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Also...

296
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:24,932
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

297
00:21:45,294 --> 00:22:07,624
[SPEAKER_13]: as far as other things I'm playing still playing the Stanley Parable off and on just so you know because there's so many different endings for it but I don't want it to get stale so I'm playing it a bit at a time I bought a game called the Shiva which is about a rabbi and it's it's a kind of a horror story from what it looks like or an investigative story so like a mystery and

298
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:09,467
[SPEAKER_13]: So it looked interesting to me and it was cheap.

299
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:14,235
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I bought some other game called 9.3M or something.

300
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:15,076
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

301
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:15,857
[SPEAKER_13]: It was cheap too.

302
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:16,799
[SPEAKER_13]: And...

303
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:29,915
[SPEAKER_13]: I've just been trying to get through what's in my Steam library and I've got a few more things on my list so we'll see what happens but my goal is to play a different game every week that's in my Steam library.

304
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:35,976
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lofty goal because those Steam libraries build up quick.

305
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:41,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I've got enough games to play a different game every week for the next 10 years so I think I'll be good.

306
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,759
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

307
00:22:58,454 --> 00:23:15,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt Kahn is the founder of GamerX and he is behind a new Kickstarter for Read Only Memories, a new cyberpunk adventure.

308
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:22,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to ask him about, you know, what's going on with GamerX and what's going on with this new game and how awesome is Snatcher and so forth.

309
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:24,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe Matt is there.

310
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:24,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, you on the line?

311
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:25,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

312
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:26,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how you guys doing?

313
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:27,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm great.

314
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.

315
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:29,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, great to have you here.

316
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm super excited to be on the show.

317
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:34,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I've really wanted to come on for a while.

318
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:34,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

319
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:41,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, gosh, we should have had you on last time you had a Kickstarter to promote because I gave a lot of money to that Kickstarter.

320
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

321
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,041
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was totally worth it.

322
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:46,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for...

323
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:48,183
[SPEAKER_04]: for putting that together.

324
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:51,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you have a whole team behind you and they all deserve kudos.

325
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,492
[SPEAKER_04]: GamerX, I had a fantastic time at GamerX and that was a great experience.

326
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:59,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I can't wait for GamerX too.

327
00:24:00,178 --> 00:24:00,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

328
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:01,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited to...

329
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:04,523
[SPEAKER_07]: to have GamerX2 happening.

330
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:18,261
[SPEAKER_07]: When we didn't get the original GamerX, we weren't sure if there would be the outcry for a second one, but people seem to have a really good time, so we're doing a second one and we're really excited about it.

331
00:24:18,817 --> 00:24:19,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, awesome.

332
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:24,021
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys have questions for Matt, you can join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

333
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:34,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some questions of my own here, and I'm sure some of us here in studio also have questions for him, but I will be throwing in some of your questions as well as we talk about GamerX and your latest Kickstarter and so forth.

334
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you a couple things about GamerX.

335
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:40,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a GamerX 2, that is happening this year, right?

336
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:40,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

337
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:41,676
[SPEAKER_04]: or this next year, 2014.

338
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:48,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed one of the things I noticed right away, you're like, the new venue is three times as big as the old one, right?

339
00:24:49,218 --> 00:25:03,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so people seem to really like the con last year, but I think that a lot of our first-time jitters showed off a little bit in that we definitely overbooked the hotel.

340
00:25:03,823 --> 00:25:12,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really crowded, and we don't want people to feel, especially with a crowd like we have, we don't want people to feel like it's claustrophobic or

341
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:15,607
[SPEAKER_07]: We want it to feel super comfortable and super homey.

342
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:28,293
[SPEAKER_07]: By going to the Intercontinental, not only are we choosing a spot that's really easy for people who live in the Bay Area to get to because it's right off BART and all the major muni lines, but also it's so much bigger.

343
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:41,179
[SPEAKER_07]: It's three times the size that even if we grow even double the size of attendees, we'll have more than enough space to make sure they're all good and have a place to hang out and chill.

344
00:25:41,704 --> 00:25:44,525
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say from this whole experience, start to finish?

345
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:44,845
[SPEAKER_04]: What was...

346
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:19,127
[SPEAKER_04]: what was the biggest lesson you learned that you could pass on to somebody else who's thinking about maybe starting something of their own in their town or something for whatever the cause is

347
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:44,657
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think that, you know, we didn't, we, I don't know, because the thing that I feel like I've learned the most is that, you know, we went into GamerX, or the original one, without having, you know, any real convention experience behind us, and so we really overestimated the amount of, you know, major sponsors that were going to come in, and we spent a lot more money

348
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:48,077
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

349
00:26:48,097 --> 00:27:01,424
[SPEAKER_07]: We were able to have a really awesome convention but we spent more money than we made which is okay but when you're running off, we don't have any venture capitalists or anything, going into the red is kind of a scary thing.

350
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:12,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I had done better budgeting and also been a little bit more realistic with the fact that because it was our first year, I think a lot of companies were scared to come on as

351
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:22,216
[SPEAKER_07]: and also, we got a lot of people who were just kind of like, they were too afraid to kind of touch an LGBT thing.

352
00:27:22,996 --> 00:27:24,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't really fit their brand.

353
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

354
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:27,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

355
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:34,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Well now, okay, so unfortunately I know our own DarkSakura did not get to go to GamerX, neither did Loki, but DarkSakura's trying to make it at least this year, I'm hoping.

356
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:35,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so.

357
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:37,786
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta come do a panel with me, I had a ton of fun.

358
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:42,369
[SPEAKER_04]: But, our buddy here in studio, Jason, actually went to GamerX.

359
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:42,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

360
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are a straight male who went to GamerX.

361
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:45,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Very much him.

362
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you persecuted?

363
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:52,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Because some of the comments you read on the internet are like, I was scared and offended.

364
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:54,154
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not even a little bit.

365
00:27:54,194 --> 00:28:06,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the short version of this is that I was having a discussion about a month ago about the finer points, prejudices, and all this stuff, and I just kind of looked up and I said, screw the labels, be awesome to people.

366
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:07,960
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the quick summary.

367
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

368
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a hell of a good time.

369
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:13,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I was around plenty of people that I knew.

370
00:28:14,384 --> 00:28:15,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I met a couple people involved.

371
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:22,551
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy that was doing visuals during the performances on Friday and Saturday night, I wound up having a conversation with him.

372
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:27,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I took over the booth for my coworker so he could go out and get some lunch.

373
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:28,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking to people for 30-45 minutes.

374
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:28,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It was...

375
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:33,118
[SPEAKER_05]: as good as all the rest of the cons that I've been to.

376
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Better, because it was even more... I go to anime cons, they're okay.

377
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more gaming-centric and tech-centric to an extent, and I had fun with it.

378
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

379
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, fun's what it's all about, right?

380
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:50,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, DKPopMan says, I want to go to a con, and Codeman says, I wish I could go to these cons.

381
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:54,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I know these guys don't live out here on the West Coast, so it's a little more of an investment.

382
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Rama says, a lot of straight people go to YaoiCon, so...

383
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:00,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they do.

384
00:29:00,545 --> 00:29:00,906
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

385
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.

386
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:14,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're really excited about Gamer X, Matt, but I know you also have this Kickstarter going on right now for this game ROM or Read Only Memories, which is a cyberpunk adventure.

387
00:29:14,978 --> 00:29:16,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?

388
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

389
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,861
[SPEAKER_07]: So at GamerX, we had a really great time.

390
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:28,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end of the GamerX, we had our kind of dead dog, like, hey, tell us what you hated or tell us your ideas.

391
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:35,206
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing that kept coming up in the question and answer was people were wondering when we were going to do a game.

392
00:29:35,266 --> 00:29:36,587
[SPEAKER_07]: They really liked our mascots.

393
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:47,435
[SPEAKER_07]: and it got us to thinking about the fact that we have some really cool mascots and one of my big things is I don't believe in complaining.

394
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:53,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I could go out and no disrespect to people that do do this but I could

395
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:56,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

396
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,027
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

397
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:37,648
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think if it does well and we can show that to people, I think that we can kind of show the gaming world that see that there is an audience for it, it's not that hard to do.

398
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:45,114
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could do it without any experience and just kind of starting from scratch, then you guys should be able to do it too.

399
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:48,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And more selfishly, we want to make a game.

400
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:49,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't want to make a game?

401
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:51,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

402
00:30:51,119 --> 00:31:00,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I remember one of the very popular panels at GamerX was when one of the game designers got up there and said, all right, everybody, we're going to make a game right now.

403
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:01,126
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all game designers.

404
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:10,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that was a really awesome approach to it because I honestly looked at that and I went, oh, my God, I wish I thought to do that for podcasting because I'm so about getting more people to podcast in independent voices.

405
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did – oh, that was such a good idea.

406
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:14,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that was so awesome.

407
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:15,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, make games.

408
00:31:16,035 --> 00:31:16,976
[SPEAKER_07]: You should do that next year.

409
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:18,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I darn well might, Matt.

410
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:20,218
[SPEAKER_04]: and more.

411
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Luke McCampbell.

412
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:56,850
[SPEAKER_07]: And they actually built a system where we actually, me and the people who are non-technical, who are writing the story for the game, we're actually writing out all the story stuff in Twine.

413
00:31:56,991 --> 00:32:03,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And they actually built an engine, a tool that will actually translate the Twine script into Unity.

414
00:32:03,776 --> 00:32:31,932
[SPEAKER_07]: so that way and then so you know once the game comes out we're actually going to put that tool up and that's going to become available for people to you know like use and like other people to like use so hopefully it'll be easier for people who make Twine games to make visual Twine games that is a fantastic benefit to this Kickstarter that I want to make sure we call out here and kind of highlight is that you know if this is successful and you're able to put all that together that can be huge for other people wanting to do this right?

415
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:33,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

416
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:39,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's one of those things where, like, we, I think that there's a lot of people who want to be able to make games like this.

417
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:43,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, I have no idea how to program.

418
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:44,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I can't program at all.

419
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:56,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guys who are making the programming of the game on our end, like, they're pretty much building out these systems so that way they can go, here we go, here's the, like, they're basically making an RPG maker.

420
00:32:56,807 --> 00:33:20,454
[SPEAKER_07]: you know like basic system for me so I can just go in and change the text you know add in what characters I want to have in what places so that way they don't even like I don't even need their help to make the game happen and once we have that there like you know I feel like there's so many great stories that should be told that I think Twine's great but it'd be cool to be able to show some of those stories in a more visual way.

421
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:33,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, obviously, when you talk about the visual and the presentation of the game, there's many references in your Kickstarter, on the Facebook and so forth, to the gaming classic Snatcher, which I know we here at OLR are very familiar with.

422
00:33:34,382 --> 00:33:36,444
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Hideo Kojima and the things he's done.

423
00:33:37,004 --> 00:33:39,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And you talk about this in the Kickstarter and so forth.

424
00:33:39,806 --> 00:33:48,452
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it about that particular game that basically makes it the framework or inspiration or whatever you want to call it to tell your own story that you're writing?

425
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:48,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

426
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:53,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, well, Snatcher's definitely in my top five games of all time.

427
00:33:54,641 --> 00:34:04,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And looking at, you know, those top five games, Snatcher seemed like the one that would be, you know, just from a more realistic perspective of, like, what could we actually build with a small team?

428
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:12,113
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, a point-and-click adventure is something that we're like, okay, that's something that we could definitely do and not overreach.

429
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:18,357
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was also something where the setting of it, which is, you know,

430
00:34:18,897 --> 00:34:19,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Deep in the Future.

431
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:23,640
[SPEAKER_07]: In Snatcher, it's 50 years in the future, so it's in the same vein.

432
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,760
[SPEAKER_07]: We're 50 years in the future.

433
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:41,729
[SPEAKER_07]: We can look at the way that the dynamics of queer culture have changed in that back in the 20s, back in the 30s, if you had a kid and he was dating an Irish kid or an Irish girl or whatever, you'd be like, oh, you can't date those Irish.

434
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:42,690
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't date the Polish.

435
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,791
[SPEAKER_07]: All that shit that by the 60s or 70s, no one even cared about that.

436
00:34:46,891 --> 00:34:51,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the 60s and 70s, you couldn't date out of your own race and things like that.

437
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,252
[SPEAKER_07]: And then people kind of – those people died off.

438
00:34:54,692 --> 00:35:00,193
[SPEAKER_07]: And now people are upset about people being trans or genderqueer or being gay or lesbian.

439
00:35:00,253 --> 00:35:04,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think as people get over the gay and lesbian thing, they'll start getting over the trans and genderqueer thing.

440
00:35:05,214 --> 00:35:06,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that by 2064, hopefully –

441
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:24,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Most characters in the game will have kind of gotten over a lot of those things and so you'll see a lot more gay and lesbian and queer and trans characters that are in positions of power or positions where they're not on a different social class as they're like...

442
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:25,508
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

443
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:53,280
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not just there because they're queer, and they're not going to be just good people because they're queer.

444
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:55,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that possibly a hint to the plot?

445
00:35:55,922 --> 00:36:01,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I picked up on, I know this is in the future, and you've got robots in this game, and you just said, I don't want my daughter to date a robot.

446
00:36:01,347 --> 00:36:02,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a little hint there?

447
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:03,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there's a couple...

448
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,012
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a couple things that we want to introduce in the game.

449
00:36:08,492 --> 00:36:12,955
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely going to be people who are going to be cybernetic.

450
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:20,741
[SPEAKER_07]: There's these devices called ROMs, and these ROMs can be... We've only shown off how Turing looks, but ROMs can be really any size.

451
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,283
[SPEAKER_07]: They can be like a wristband, they can be whatever.

452
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:26,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Because in the future, we're not going to really...

453
00:36:26,565 --> 00:36:27,005
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

454
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:59,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, on the internet, there's all these people who... It's a better life than the real world.

455
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:00,646
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very true.

456
00:37:00,906 --> 00:37:01,626
[SPEAKER_07]: That is very true.

457
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:04,707
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be interesting to explore that.

458
00:37:05,288 --> 00:37:11,510
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that I really want to explore with the game is... I come originally from the tech world, and I saw how...

459
00:37:14,211 --> 00:37:14,491
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

460
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:48,424
[SPEAKER_07]: and you know like I think we're already kind of starting to see it but it'll be interesting to kind of be able to talk about that and actually have a little bit of experience of like knowing some of the people who are actually like kind of putting these processes into place now and knowing kind of what they dream the future to be and and

461
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:50,445
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, you have something to throw in?

462
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:17,685
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just saying, I was thinking about a little bit of Shadowrun without the extra fantasy elements that Shadowrun throws in.

463
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:20,808
[SPEAKER_13]: I was actually getting a big hint of Rifts too.

464
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:23,832
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you ever did any tabletop RPGs.

465
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:27,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I've played a little bit of Shadowrun.

466
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:33,701
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely something where we want to keep it very close to that cyberpunk niche.

467
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:46,645
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to see a lot of things that are... If you watch Blade Runner, Snatcher, Rise of the Dragon, anything that is cyberpunk-y, we're going to try to keep that as much as possible.

468
00:38:47,546 --> 00:38:48,026
[SPEAKER_07]: While...

469
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:49,487
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on and so forth.

470
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:24,762
[SPEAKER_07]: and it'll be interesting to see but also apply kind of a lot of that cyberpunk CRT monitor FM sounds you know like make it feel very 80s and a little backwards at times too

471
00:39:26,076 --> 00:39:29,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, the Kickstarter is for a game, ROM, Read Only Memories.

472
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:36,283
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to check that out, unfortunately, Kickstarter doesn't really have short URLs, so I would encourage you to just search for that, Read Only Memories.

473
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:42,107
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also back this, and some of the rewards include just for $6, it looks like.

474
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:48,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So for $6, we'll get you the unlock code for the full version when it's released on OUYA or Mac and PC.

475
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:55,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the other rewards, $20, this is the one that I actually personally did, where you can get your name, company, or website in the credits,

476
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to give a little OrangeLawnsRadio.com love in the game.

477
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:00,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I gotta ask.

478
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:01,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the OUYA?

479
00:40:02,424 --> 00:40:05,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so, well, the cool thing is that they're going to double our money.

480
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:06,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

481
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:07,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.

482
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:18,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you know, all that we have to do is that when we launch the game, we're going to release it on Mac and PC, and if we hit a stretch goal, also Linux, and then also OUYA at the same time.

483
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:20,439
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to release on all four of those platforms.

484
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,060
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

485
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:27,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot that they opened that up to where you can also publish on PC to be qualified for their, you know, fun of the games or whatever they call the thing.

486
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:33,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we're going to release that game, and we're going to release it on Steam and PC and Mac and OUYA all at the same time.

487
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:53,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the six months between when we release it on those systems and then we release it on iOS and Android, we'll spend those six months making sure that we fix any bugs that may have been in the original releases, making it suitable for touchscreen interfaces, making improvements specifically for mobile.

488
00:40:53,570 --> 00:41:18,489
[SPEAKER_07]: so like in actuality it's you know like it'd be cool if we could release it all at the same time but we can actually use that time to make it better and yeah I mean like it's free money and it's something where like I'm a big fan of the idea of the OUYA like I like the Android platform I like the idea of people can create anything and put it up there I mean I know they've made a lot of PR mistakes and I know that they're not like beloved by everyone and

489
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:27,482
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew that it wasn't going to be the best PR decision to do it, but I still believe it's a good idea.

490
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:37,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the kind of system that our game would actually be perfect for, where a long-term story-based adventure game doesn't really exist on that system.

491
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:40,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that might be something that people would be into.

492
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:49,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get to some of the chat room questions that we have too because we have a few questions in chat and I have a couple of other questions I want to ask though.

493
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,642
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them here about the music in the game because I definitely noticed this.

494
00:41:53,662 --> 00:42:00,265
[SPEAKER_04]: You have some artists who agreed to help out with the game, Aethernaut, Vert, some names that people ought to know.

495
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:02,786
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of soundtrack do you try to make with this game?

496
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:20,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, so one of the things that was really cool about Snatcher was that, although, like, it was a very, very simple game, like it was just text, you know, select text, select text, menus, um, it had really, really awesome visuals, but more importantly, because it ran on Sega CD, it had really amazing music, um...

497
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:24,295
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was, you know, the music was way out of proportion for the visuals.

498
00:42:25,036 --> 00:42:32,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the same way, like, we want to have very kind of simple, kind of very, like, 80s, 16-bit visuals, but we want really, like, awesome music.

499
00:42:32,963 --> 00:42:42,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And so music has been one of the things that we wanted to focus on from the beginning is, you know, getting really awesome artists who want to come and be involved with the game and

500
00:42:43,212 --> 00:42:49,075
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually just released yesterday on our Kickstarter update a style sheet of some of the songs that really influence us.

501
00:42:50,355 --> 00:42:57,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those include games from these PC-88, the UNO field stage, and Shin Megami Tensei IV.

502
00:42:57,878 --> 00:43:06,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Just all these FM synthy, it's kind of hard to explain, but if you check out the list, we have just some of the music that inspires us.

503
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:23,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Aethernaut and Vert and 2Mellow and all these people that we're working with, they just really dug the vibe and I think a lot of them were big fans of Snatcher growing up and they were really into the idea of giving it a try to making something cyberpunk-y.

504
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:50,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I got one more question for you and then we're going to go to some of our chat questions at live.vognetwork.com It's not too late to get your question in if you have a question for Matt Kahn with GamerX and Read Only Memories Matt, I ask this of everybody who comes on this show to pitch a Kickstarter so I'm going to ask you as well The funding you're trying to raise for this $62,064 which is kind of a funny number but what do you need that money for?

505
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is that money going to ultimately go?

506
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:53,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

507
00:43:53,202 --> 00:43:54,724
[SPEAKER_07]: So a couple of things.

508
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:57,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're working with a team of seven people.

509
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:00,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Myself, I'm producing the game.

510
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:02,609
[SPEAKER_07]: We have John James, who's our lead artist.

511
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,511
[SPEAKER_07]: We have – I'm sorry.

512
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:06,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me actually make sure I don't get anyone's names wrong.

513
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:08,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Luke McCampbell and –

514
00:44:09,754 --> 00:44:38,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Ted Danola, they're programming the games Ted Danola is he used to work at Zynga and Puppy Punch Productions and he's like super duper legit and he's leading up the programming side of things and so we've only started really getting this programmed over the last couple months and things have been ramping up super quickly with him and then we have Tumelo and we have Fred and we have all these other people who are working on the music and especially with people like Aethonaut and Vert like

515
00:44:39,412 --> 00:44:44,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I could get them to give us a good deal on music, but I'd rather that they get paid a fair amount for their work.

516
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:50,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make sure that everyone gets a fair amount to work on this game.

517
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:59,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Between all those people, and then we also have Shams, who's our CFO, mid-boss, and who's going to be doing all the fulfillment and stuff, it's a lot of work.

518
00:45:00,078 --> 00:45:02,619
[SPEAKER_07]: The money is mostly going into paying those people.

519
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:05,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there's also the Unity fees.

520
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,803
[SPEAKER_07]: The actual distribution fees of getting those games out there.

521
00:45:10,223 --> 00:45:12,504
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just paying for it.

522
00:45:12,524 --> 00:45:13,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have more music.

523
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have more artists come on board.

524
00:45:16,107 --> 00:45:18,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to make sure they get treated right.

525
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:20,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do notice you have some stretch goals.

526
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:29,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, if you can get there, provide an actual soundtrack, OST, if you've backed up a certain level, a Linux port, and possibly an art book at different stretch goal levels.

527
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:32,559
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are looking at 11 days to go.

528
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got about 20K to go.

529
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're on track, but every little bit helps, especially meeting those stretch goals.

530
00:45:40,102 --> 00:45:46,165
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are listening here at vognetwork.com or on the podcast feed or on Stitcher, I definitely encourage you guys to check this out.

531
00:45:46,685 --> 00:45:48,766
[SPEAKER_04]: You can keep tabs on Matt's projects.

532
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamerconnect.com would probably be the best place to send them.

533
00:45:51,807 --> 00:45:54,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure where your hub is for all this.

534
00:45:54,528 --> 00:46:24,098
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah well I mean we're actually making a bunch of changes right now because like you know we now that we're not just doing GamerX we're now kind of reforming as mid-boss in a way so now we have a game and we have the convention we're working really hard on GamerConnect.com to get it up to like being something really awesome but it's just really tough because like it's basically we're trying to emulate a lot of features that Facebook has and it's just hard with one person you know programming it to keep it up um

535
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:51,770
[SPEAKER_07]: but we actually just released a new news feed today and we really want it to be a place where if you're a queer geek you can go and talk about games and relax and we just need to put more work into it and make sure that it runs fast and looks good part of that is we don't really have the money yet to hire people to do that so if you go to GamerConnect it has all of our projects GamerX2 is next July and you can get your tickets now

536
00:46:53,090 --> 00:47:21,592
[SPEAKER_07]: and also one of the cool things about Read Only Memories is you can actually get tickets for GamerX2 in the rewards for the Kickstarter and so for the $79 level that's only $9 more than a regular 3 day ticket and then for that you get 3 copies of the game you get the beanie, you get the stickers and you get a ticket to the con and that money gets doubled for us because of Ouya so you're helping us out too so it's a good deal

537
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:22,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

538
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:25,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Matt, I hope we're not taking up too much of your time, but I do want to get some chat questions, if you don't mind.

539
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:27,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple of questions here.

540
00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:33,140
[SPEAKER_04]: DungeonBuster in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, asking, will ROM have action sequences like in Snatcher?

541
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,822
[SPEAKER_04]: As good as Snatcher is, I think it could have stood well enough without them.

542
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:39,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do have them, will there be an option to skip them?

543
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:44,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I don't want there to be action sequences.

544
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:52,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mind the action sequences in Snatcher.

545
00:47:52,457 --> 00:47:53,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually thought that they were okay.

546
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:59,645
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've ever played Policenauts, which is sort of like the spiritual sequel in a way to Snatcher...

547
00:48:01,896 --> 00:48:04,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not enjoy the action sequences in that.

548
00:48:04,278 --> 00:48:09,362
[SPEAKER_07]: With Snatcher, they had the grid format.

549
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:13,166
[SPEAKER_07]: They totally ditched it for Policenauts, and they just expected you had a light gun.

550
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:17,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was impossible to play as an emulation or without the gun.

551
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:18,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

552
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:26,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with Rise of the Dragon, it just has the worst, awful, just disgusting arcade elements you've ever seen in your life.

553
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:37,758
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got this really cool gameplay, and then you go into the arcade elements, and your character, when he jumps, he jumps like 30 feet in the air, and it's disgusting.

554
00:48:38,438 --> 00:48:41,259
[SPEAKER_07]: If you play it, you would be sick to your stomach.

555
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:59,981
[SPEAKER_07]: So that being said, we also don't have a ton of experience with... This is a pretty new team, and we have two really awesome programmers, but I've seen what we're doing with the dialogue and inventory and how we're working on that, and I feel like...

556
00:49:01,323 --> 00:49:04,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to shoehorn anything in that isn't going to feel natural to the game.

557
00:49:06,185 --> 00:49:13,127
[SPEAKER_07]: If there is going to be minigames, it would probably be more around like, hey, you need to move these wires around to unlock this puzzle.

558
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:20,729
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would think that it would be more around puzzle stuff and things that aren't time-based or whatever.

559
00:49:21,729 --> 00:49:30,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I've usually found that in adventure games, action scenes, while they're fun and they kind of keep you on your toes, can be really, really frustrating.

560
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:48,642
[SPEAKER_04]: and not very fun because it can be a blockade to progress the story too which I can totally see that element of it like how many times of like forget it I can't get past this one thing in the game forget it I'm out I'm out and then you know you would miss the story so I totally hear you on that

561
00:49:49,963 --> 00:49:51,124
[SPEAKER_04]: One more question here from chat.

562
00:49:51,144 --> 00:50:01,774
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a question about GamerX from SSJ100 Matt in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com asks, I understand this is still very new, but what do you see as the future of GamerX?

563
00:50:01,895 --> 00:50:02,896
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the next step?

564
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:05,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is a great idea that I could see growing even more.

565
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:09,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, the whole plan for GamerX

566
00:50:11,494 --> 00:50:16,077
[SPEAKER_07]: We recently appointed a new president whose name is Tony and they are awesome.

567
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:27,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And the idea for GamerX is like when we first created it and when I first created SFGamers, I wanted there to be a safe space for other gay and queer gamers like myself.

568
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:33,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of used the word gamer because I kind of always kind of thought that was a really super inclusive word.

569
00:50:35,249 --> 00:51:02,359
[SPEAKER_07]: but the more I've kind of met people I've realized that the name is kind of in a way it can be a little off-putting to straight people who want to come and people who want to come who aren't necessarily gay identifying and I don't want the con to be something where people feel uncomfortable going because of the name or even because of the vibe I want the vibe just to be a place where anyone, no matter whether they be genderqueer or straight or a furry or an ally or

570
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:04,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Trans, or Bai, or just a woman.

571
00:51:05,401 --> 00:51:22,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone who maybe feels like they aren't culturally accepted by the mainstream gaming media to be able to come and feel like they're on an equal level playing field where people aren't going to judge you because of some preconceived notions of like, oh, well, you're a girl, so you can't play games, or you're gay, you can't play games, or whatever.

572
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:28,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think you look at players like Scarlet, who almost just won the world championships for StarCraft.

573
00:51:29,918 --> 00:51:35,484
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, who's a trans woman and it's like, obviously, women and queer people can play games.

574
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:44,594
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I want it to be a place where everyone's treated with respect but I want it to also be a place where, like, if you're a straight person, like, I'm sick of people being like, oh, I can't go to this because it's a gay event.

575
00:51:44,674 --> 00:51:45,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, it's like,

576
00:51:46,596 --> 00:51:48,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really like that.

577
00:51:48,078 --> 00:52:02,513
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more like almost – and I even hesitate to compare it to this but like an LGBT film festival where it's like you might see some films that have queer content in them or you might have conversations that talk about some gay stuff.

578
00:52:03,014 --> 00:52:07,138
[SPEAKER_07]: But like for the most part, it's a gaming convention and I think that you'll find that most gamers –

579
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,481
[SPEAKER_07]: care more about games than anything else in their life.

580
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:18,747
[SPEAKER_07]: But that being said, the gays and the queers of us also deserve to be able to feel comfortable and be able to flirt with one another in a safe environment.

581
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:24,701
[SPEAKER_04]: An interesting response here from Queen Simeon, our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, there's that.

582
00:52:25,021 --> 00:52:30,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought personally, if I attended GamerX as a straight cis woman, I'd be invading a safe space.

583
00:52:30,503 --> 00:52:32,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's the case at all.

584
00:52:33,004 --> 00:52:34,204
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

585
00:52:34,304 --> 00:52:43,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, you know, we actually had Anita Sarkeesian was there and we had a ton of really awesome women who came and were just, you know, regular cis, not regular, just, you know, cis women.

586
00:52:43,807 --> 00:52:44,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

587
00:52:44,788 --> 00:52:46,508
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they actually really enjoyed it.

588
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:48,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I feel like

589
00:52:48,909 --> 00:53:07,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something where it's kind of almost comparable to a gay club where it's like a lot of cis women go to gay clubs in San Francisco because they know that they'll be in a safe space where they know that they'll be treated with respect and they're not going to be groped on or hit on unnecessarily and just be able to dance and have fun.

590
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:09,205
[SPEAKER_07]: In the same way, it's

591
00:53:11,527 --> 00:53:19,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we as gamers, and by that I mean queer gamers, we don't want other people to not come.

592
00:53:20,152 --> 00:53:22,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we want people to acknowledge who we are.

593
00:53:23,655 --> 00:53:31,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the more that people acknowledge that we are an existing group and that we're just like you and everyone else, that's really, really important.

594
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:42,470
[SPEAKER_07]: because I don't subscribe to that whole idea of we're making GamerX to make a seclusionary event and you should only go to GamerX and don't go to PAX or don't go to E3 because that's silly.

595
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:49,457
[SPEAKER_07]: People can go to as many conferences as they want or can afford to go to and this is just a different experience.

596
00:53:49,597 --> 00:53:51,158
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to create something that's

597
00:53:54,381 --> 00:53:55,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really out there right now.

598
00:53:55,522 --> 00:54:04,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, I gotta say, Matt, as somebody who, you know, for a period in my late teens and early 20s, I literally thought I was the only gay nerd.

599
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:07,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I thought I was the only gay nerd on the whole damn planet.

600
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:14,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So to now, you know, maybe now I'm in my mid-30s, but to see something like this happen was really amazing, Matt.

601
00:54:14,097 --> 00:54:18,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gotta thank you and your team for doing this because I'm like, oh my god.

602
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,062
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm speaking from experience here, you guys.

603
00:54:20,502 --> 00:54:45,929
[SPEAKER_04]: like to be that 18 or 19 year old who is thinking that like I am the only gay nerd on the entire planet to be to be shown like no you're not you're the only gay nerd in the village but but no you're not and to have to kind of have that celebration not just like look other gay nerds but a celebration of all things nerd is just I it meant a lot to me personally and I was so happy to see it happen

604
00:54:46,569 --> 00:54:47,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

605
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,273
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of my whole goal with it.

606
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:50,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I think back to my...

607
00:54:51,950 --> 00:55:21,000
[SPEAKER_07]: 16 year old gay nerdy self and like how much of the time I would either hang out with gay people and I would like have to hide being a nerdy or I would hang out with nerdy people and have to hide being gay and I felt like I was living a lesser life than my true self and I feel like if people can look at GamerX and see there's thousands of other queer geeks out there just like them hopefully they won't feel like they're alone they feel like you know the whole point of creating GamerConnect was so that way people can you know can connect with their community and find other people in their community and like

608
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:28,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember being in college and finding GayGamer.net and being like, this is what I've been looking for my entire life.

609
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:34,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt like if I can help other people find that, that's my calling in a way.

610
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you have one more thought here?

611
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:38,013
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't a very big thing.

612
00:55:38,553 --> 00:55:40,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually just wondering how the asexual turnout is.

613
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:44,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, we, so we don't obviously ask people at the door.

614
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, I was just wondering if there was representation.

615
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:48,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

616
00:55:48,133 --> 00:55:54,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so the thing is that, like, uh, we try to accommodate, like, everything in terms of, um, like, panels.

617
00:55:54,556 --> 00:56:10,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't remember exactly what panels we had last year off the top of my head, but I know that we had panels that, that, um, I know for sure that we had panels that were submitted about, like, you know, being asexual and being in the community and, you know, as someone who, I dated someone who was asexual, um,

618
00:56:11,886 --> 00:56:18,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I obviously don't think that there's any lifestyle that isn't valid, but I totally understand and I want that.

619
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:26,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people have a lot of ignorance about people who are asexual and I think that more education along those lines would be great.

620
00:56:27,656 --> 00:56:39,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I can't speak to the attendance of it at that level, I would love to see more panels by people who either identify as asexual or want to talk about asexual ideas, especially as they pertain to gaming at GamerX too.

621
00:56:39,504 --> 00:56:40,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be super duper awesome.

622
00:56:41,505 --> 00:57:10,090
[SPEAKER_04]: it's funny I actually did have an idea for a panel you better write that down asexuality and shipping why it's a nightmare so yeah you know GamerX definitely a celebration of diversity and I think it's only going to be a bigger celebration in this next year Matt I wish you the best of luck with GamerX too and your team as well I know Tony is leading it now and it will be fabulous with the group that you helped assemble last year I know it

623
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:32,232
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course with this game Read Only Memories A New Cyberpunk Adventure please check it out on Kickstarter take a look at the video and let's see if we can't help Matt raise that $20,000 more they need to get it to happen Matt before I get any last plugs from you and let you go I do have to ask you about one other topic that's completely different like you were not prepared to talk about this you ready?

624
00:57:32,632 --> 00:57:33,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got it.

625
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:33,773
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

626
00:57:33,933 --> 00:57:36,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to bring it because here's the thing.

627
00:57:36,794 --> 00:57:40,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, DarkSakura, she doesn't watch a lot of reality television.

628
00:57:40,955 --> 00:57:41,396
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I don't.

629
00:57:41,536 --> 00:57:47,498
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a show in Britain about Britain's worst driver, and they adapted it in Canada.

630
00:57:47,938 --> 00:57:49,819
[SPEAKER_04]: And you love yourself some Canada's worst driver.

631
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:51,420
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Canada's worst driver.

632
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:58,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that Matt, and this is on Wiki, so I know it's true, Matt was a contestant on America's worst driver.

633
00:57:59,183 --> 00:57:59,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

634
00:57:59,663 --> 00:57:59,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

635
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:02,366
[SPEAKER_04]: and Matt, am I correct?

636
00:58:02,467 --> 00:58:05,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, spoiler alert, Matt, you won the whole damn thing, didn't you?

637
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:07,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I am America's worst driver.

638
00:58:10,012 --> 00:58:15,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I haven't watched the American one just because I heard that it was like way too Americanized.

639
00:58:15,736 --> 00:58:17,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the Canadian one is just awesome.

640
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:21,621
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like we teach you how to do stunt driving and you have to do all this.

641
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:22,601
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very polite.

642
00:58:22,782 --> 00:58:25,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, it is really... Well, I don't know.

643
00:58:25,323 --> 00:58:29,406
[SPEAKER_13]: There's this one girl who's kind of freaking out on... They're doing Worst Driver Ever this season.

644
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:31,828
[SPEAKER_13]: But what was it like for you?

645
00:58:31,848 --> 00:58:33,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, was it embarrassing to be on it?

646
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Or did you learn something from it?

647
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:38,233
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the thing is that like...

648
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:42,314
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, at this point, I don't really care what the Travel Channel does to me.

649
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:44,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so the whole thing was all scripted.

650
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:45,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

651
00:58:45,654 --> 00:58:54,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like, each city that we went to, they would be like, okay, so the rules were, there was eight, okay, so all scripted is maybe not exactly correct.

652
00:58:54,816 --> 00:58:56,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's eight cities that they would go to.

653
00:58:56,697 --> 00:59:02,418
[SPEAKER_07]: And in each of the cities, they said, okay, so there's going to be four contestants, and the worst driver in the city would have their car destroyed.

654
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:02,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

655
00:59:03,038 --> 00:59:08,584
[SPEAKER_07]: However, those contestants would then be brought back for the finale where seven out of those eight teams would win brand new cars.

656
00:59:09,385 --> 00:59:14,510
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically they're telling you to lose so that way you'd have a seven out of eight chance to win a new car.

657
00:59:15,757 --> 00:59:24,748
[SPEAKER_07]: So in each of the cities, it's super fake because all eight episodes, everyone's trying to do the worst thing possible.

658
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:35,101
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was just able to win in San Francisco because I had a really crappy car, and so I was willing to basically total it on the show either way.

659
00:59:36,512 --> 00:59:38,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was just totally breaking all the rules.

660
00:59:38,352 --> 00:59:40,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I was driving down Lombard Street and crashing into shit.

661
00:59:41,893 --> 00:59:42,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was having a blast.

662
00:59:42,893 --> 00:59:47,634
[SPEAKER_07]: If you watched the first episode, the first episode in the finale, the first episode I'm having so much fun.

663
00:59:47,794 --> 00:59:49,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually like I'm never tripping at all.

664
00:59:49,935 --> 00:59:51,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, yeah, this is great.

665
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:52,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having fun.

666
00:59:52,915 --> 00:59:59,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the finale, then it was like actually a real contest where they would have like elimination style challenges.

667
00:59:59,737 --> 01:00:00,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

668
01:00:00,817 --> 01:00:04,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something where they never let you watch the other people compete and they don't have any times.

669
01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:06,484
[SPEAKER_07]: They just be like, yeah, you won or lost.

670
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:16,096
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone during my SF things actually carried a stopwatch in their pocket and the time that they got was completely different than the thing they had in their pocket.

671
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:19,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Which meant that they were like, yeah, this whole show is fixed.

672
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:27,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, fixed or not, in the finale, I watched as there's eight teams, and I'm super confident.

673
01:00:27,888 --> 01:00:30,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, yeah, I'm not a bad driver.

674
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:31,632
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way I'm going to lose to all these people.

675
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:35,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched it go from eight teams to seven teams to six teams to five teams.

676
01:00:36,176 --> 01:00:39,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched my expression, and I was wearing demon horns in the first episode.

677
01:00:39,859 --> 01:00:41,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super fun and having fun.

678
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,263
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time there's three teams left, I'm like, shit.

679
01:00:44,363 --> 01:00:45,204
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

680
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:08,747
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just pretty obvious.

681
01:01:08,807 --> 01:01:16,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It's two little shithead kids versus this really sweet older women.

682
01:01:16,117 --> 01:01:17,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Not older, but you know.

683
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:21,384
[SPEAKER_07]: There are people who didn't deserve to lose versus two brats.

684
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:22,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And

685
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:27,868
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, you know, I think I knew that like storyline wise we were going to lose.

686
01:01:28,048 --> 01:01:40,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I was panicking and I wasn't driving well and I lost and then they were like, oh, we're going to, the Robosaurus is going to destroy the new car of the person who lost and then so destroyed the car that I would have gotten.

687
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they have Robosaurus in Canada?

688
01:01:42,913 --> 01:01:46,113
[SPEAKER_13]: No, this is completely different than the Canadian version.

689
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:52,615
[SPEAKER_13]: In the Canadian version, they basically pick eight drivers from around the different provinces who can't drive for a different reason.

690
01:01:53,295 --> 01:01:54,776
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they actually go through driver rehab.

691
01:01:55,836 --> 01:02:00,177
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you get voted off, that means you actually were a good driver when you graduated rehab.

692
01:02:00,557 --> 01:02:03,218
[SPEAKER_13]: If you win the whole thing, that means you are the worst driver.

693
01:02:03,998 --> 01:02:06,139
[SPEAKER_13]: You get a trophy of crashed car parts.

694
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we didn't get any training or anything.

695
01:02:09,242 --> 01:02:14,186
[SPEAKER_07]: We just had the first episode, and then they were like, come back for the finale, and they never gave us any training.

696
01:02:14,206 --> 01:02:15,307
[SPEAKER_07]: They just were like, eh.

697
01:02:15,767 --> 01:02:18,870
[SPEAKER_13]: It just seems like the only similarity is the name then.

698
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, maybe.

699
01:02:20,231 --> 01:02:28,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know it has nothing to do with video games, but knowing that DarkSakura loves her Canada's Worst, I had to ask you about that.

700
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:30,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And I even see some comments in the chat room.

701
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Codeman says, I've never watched this, but it sounds awesome.

702
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:36,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cancelled after one season.

703
01:02:36,407 --> 01:02:37,889
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the worst show.

704
01:02:37,949 --> 01:02:38,710
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so bad.

705
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:40,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew while we were filming it it was going to be cancelled.

706
01:02:42,294 --> 01:02:43,175
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so bad.

707
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:45,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that you have a great sense of humor about it though.

708
01:02:45,377 --> 01:02:51,064
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wonder if they had kept the original format if it would have lasted because it's on its 8th season in Canada now.

709
01:02:51,144 --> 01:02:51,745
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll never know.

710
01:02:52,345 --> 01:02:53,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you they would have.

711
01:02:53,266 --> 01:02:58,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the thing is that when they were filming it, I could tell it was going to be really bad, and then I found out the time slot.

712
01:02:58,171 --> 01:02:59,793
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like Saturdays at 10 p.m.

713
01:03:00,554 --> 01:03:01,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Travel Channel.

714
01:03:01,314 --> 01:03:03,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, man, they have no confidence in this show.

715
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:08,742
[SPEAKER_13]: See, I've actually learned stuff watching the Canadian version, and I know Canadian road signs now.

716
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:11,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they that different?

717
01:03:11,439 --> 01:03:12,880
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some that are different.

718
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Matt, we gotta let you go.

719
01:03:14,861 --> 01:03:16,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for having a good sense of humor about that.

720
01:03:16,941 --> 01:03:17,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And seriously, I mean it.

721
01:03:18,022 --> 01:03:21,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so looking forward to GamerX 2 and everything your whole team's putting on.

722
01:03:21,803 --> 01:03:23,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And best of luck with read-only memories.

723
01:03:24,044 --> 01:03:24,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you make it.

724
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:26,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for having me on.

725
01:03:26,484 --> 01:03:27,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to chat more.

726
01:03:28,926 --> 01:03:30,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Please check out Read Only Memories.

727
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:33,809
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have tickets to GamerX2 on there that are super cheap.

728
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:38,172
[SPEAKER_07]: If you back it on there, then we are going to basically double your money.

729
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,494
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to make a really awesome game on top of it.

730
01:03:40,874 --> 01:03:41,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

731
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:50,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, best of luck to you guys, and yes, let's keep in touch, and I will see you at least at GamerX2, if not a heck of a lot sooner, because I'm in San Francisco all the time.

732
01:03:50,949 --> 01:03:54,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll get some really nice ethnic food.

733
01:03:54,073 --> 01:03:56,556
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go get some Peruvian food down in...

734
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,762
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you can watch me have seven drinks like I did last night and make a fool out of myself.

735
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:05,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Matt, buddy, take care and good luck.

736
01:04:05,744 --> 01:04:06,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, man, have a great day.

737
01:04:06,724 --> 01:04:07,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care.

738
01:04:09,086 --> 01:04:09,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was great.

739
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:10,266
[SPEAKER_13]: I like him.

740
01:04:10,526 --> 01:04:11,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's fun.

741
01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:11,707
[SPEAKER_04]: He's fun.

742
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:12,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

743
01:04:12,768 --> 01:04:14,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to convince Dan to let me buy the $80 package.

744
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:14,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

745
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan, money.

746
01:04:18,311 --> 01:04:19,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan, package.

747
01:04:20,053 --> 01:04:20,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no.

748
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:21,795
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Hanukkah, for God's sake.

749
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:24,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it is, but he already bought me games.

750
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:27,300
[SPEAKER_13]: So somebody give me 80 bucks.

751
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:27,780
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

752
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:29,022
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll go to a good cause.

753
01:04:29,082 --> 01:04:29,642
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll go to me.

754
01:04:30,223 --> 01:04:31,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that went on a little long.

755
01:04:31,504 --> 01:04:33,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I think I ate more show than we intended to, but Matt was a lot of fun.

756
01:04:33,886 --> 01:04:35,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to ask him about the worst driver thing.

757
01:04:35,268 --> 01:04:35,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to.

758
01:04:36,429 --> 01:04:38,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.VogNetwork.com if you want to keep commenting.

759
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:40,453
[SPEAKER_03]: You forgot to ask him what he was playing.

760
01:04:41,193 --> 01:04:41,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

761
01:04:42,353 --> 01:04:43,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame.

762
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:44,794
[SPEAKER_04]: What's more important, though?

763
01:04:45,074 --> 01:04:47,395
[SPEAKER_04]: The where's the money going question or the what are you playing question?

764
01:04:47,415 --> 01:04:49,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the more important one was the worst driver.

765
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,836
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the most important question.

766
01:04:51,876 --> 01:04:52,136
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

767
01:04:52,516 --> 01:04:52,796
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

768
01:04:52,816 --> 01:04:53,456
[SPEAKER_13]: That was awesome.

769
01:04:53,476 --> 01:04:57,358
[SPEAKER_13]: And now I know that I'm glad I didn't watch the American.

770
01:04:57,418 --> 01:04:59,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I thought about going back to find it.

771
01:04:59,898 --> 01:05:01,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you know me.

772
01:05:01,219 --> 01:05:02,959
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen every... I know.

773
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for the last two episodes.

774
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,620
[SPEAKER_04]: You come in here all the time.

775
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate TV.

776
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I never watch TV.

777
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:07,880
[SPEAKER_04]: But Canada's the worst driver.

778
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

779
01:05:08,101 --> 01:05:09,021
[SPEAKER_13]: It's because I watch it on YouTube.

780
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:09,501
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

781
01:05:10,482 --> 01:05:11,323
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta get back to games.

782
01:05:13,306 --> 01:05:18,635
[SPEAKER_05]: To register for participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase adult.

783
01:05:19,596 --> 01:05:23,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly, let's try to get through the rest of our gaming weeks and then some of the news as well.

784
01:05:23,362 --> 01:05:23,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

785
01:05:24,756 --> 01:05:26,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So this week I played a few things.

786
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:32,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been meaning to play Fallout New Vegas since last Steam sale.

787
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I finally got around to playing it and I did not like it.

788
01:05:37,621 --> 01:05:41,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was so disappointed because I really had high hopes for that game and

789
01:05:42,703 --> 01:05:44,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I want to spend the effort to do that right now.

790
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:24,121
[SPEAKER_03]: um but anyways I just I just didn't like the the setting I didn't like the story because I didn't understand what the hell was going on and I just didn't like the way it played there's no fucking sprint for one at least I couldn't find it um so it was just I don't know it bugged me it just rubbed me the wrong way I guess and so I don't know if I'm gonna continue on with it

791
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:29,142
[SPEAKER_03]: That said, I also played Minecraft this week.

792
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:38,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for a little bit, I went ahead and updated my version I had on PC to get the latest thing because they just put an update out not too long ago.

793
01:06:38,087 --> 01:06:39,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 1.7.2 now.

794
01:06:40,168 --> 01:06:41,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize that.

795
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:43,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to check it out too.

796
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:45,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's changed.

797
01:06:45,091 --> 01:06:49,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit, the biomes now are really intricate.

798
01:06:49,313 --> 01:06:53,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I reloaded our seed that we had and it's fucking terrible now.

799
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:55,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

800
01:07:15,872 --> 01:07:32,491
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they also have the ones where you can spawn these like really um I don't know what they call it like uh basically exaggerated versions of the different biomes and stuff um almost like extreme or something and it looks really um unique very tall mountains and stuff um

801
01:07:34,424 --> 01:07:37,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I still haven't gotten around to setting up the multiplayer server, so I don't know about that yet.

802
01:07:39,169 --> 01:07:43,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Then also... I'm hoping for a VOG Minecraft server comeback in 2014.

803
01:07:43,453 --> 01:07:43,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping.

804
01:07:44,114 --> 01:07:45,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I have all the information to do it.

805
01:07:45,555 --> 01:07:46,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't gotten around to it.

806
01:07:46,276 --> 01:07:49,459
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no more Team Fortress 2 server, so maybe I can redirect the money.

807
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:50,980
[SPEAKER_03]: We have... Well, no.

808
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:56,586
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we have... Gally has offered us his server, so... No hate against Team Fortress 2, by the way.

809
01:07:56,626 --> 01:07:57,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I still love Team Fortress 2.

810
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:58,968
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't really being used anymore.

811
01:07:59,068 --> 01:08:27,423
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so um next game Gatling has a server up but see that's the thing is getting people like on it because it was a ghost town like most of the time um and that's kind of the problem with anything that we do like even like Team Fortress 2 and stuff it's a ghost town most of the time so um I don't know and even like creative mode gets boring after a while it's like survival at least there's something you like if you're playing on your own there's stuff that you can be doing whereas it's like if you go into you know creative mode it's like

812
01:08:27,623 --> 01:08:28,424
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

813
01:08:49,563 --> 01:09:00,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then Steam Sale, like, I've been looking at stuff, I almost bought a lot of things, but the only thing I bought, um, is just the Season Pass for Saints Row 4.

814
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:09,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know I said I wasn't gonna do that, but it was on sale, you know, 66% off, and I feel that the price of that is, is definitely worth what they're giving me.

815
01:09:10,081 --> 01:09:14,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Although what it gave me instead of really shitty DLC was a thing that broke my game.

816
01:09:14,844 --> 01:09:18,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now I had to uninstall it and I have to reinstall it and see if that fixes it.

817
01:09:18,647 --> 01:09:22,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought at first, oh, it's because I have mods that I made and put in there and stuff like that.

818
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:24,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I took all those out and it still didn't fucking work.

819
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:28,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a little disappointed that it broke the whole game.

820
01:09:28,554 --> 01:09:30,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see if I reload it.

821
01:09:30,315 --> 01:09:36,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it'll fix itself and I can start slowly loading the mods in and see if that works again.

822
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:37,059
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just...

823
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:39,420
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, it's annoying.

824
01:09:39,861 --> 01:09:40,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

825
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:40,881
[SPEAKER_03]: To say the least.

826
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 5, did a, got in the back of a train and got five stars and was sniping people with, you know, my sniper rifle and stuff as Trevor, so that was kind of fun.

827
01:09:54,405 --> 01:09:55,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I have to bring this up.

828
01:09:55,826 --> 01:09:59,707
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned Steam sale and DarkSakura, because it was like, oh, six o'clock, new Flash sales.

829
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:01,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So she just loaded it up on her iPad.

830
01:10:01,908 --> 01:10:02,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, don't judge me.

831
01:10:02,928 --> 01:10:05,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally at the same time, we both pointed and went, Deadpool.

832
01:10:05,429 --> 01:10:05,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

833
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:08,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care how shitty this game is.

834
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,651
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care how shitty it is.

835
01:10:10,452 --> 01:10:12,973
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting the fucking Deadpool game because fuck is Deadpool.

836
01:10:13,593 --> 01:10:15,094
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm a consumer whore.

837
01:10:15,334 --> 01:10:16,035
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those nights.

838
01:10:17,215 --> 01:10:19,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to get Bobby to buy Saints Row.

839
01:10:19,036 --> 01:10:19,597
[SPEAKER_03]: They had it down at $19.

840
01:10:19,637 --> 01:10:22,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, okay.

841
01:10:22,538 --> 01:10:24,940
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so I've been good.

842
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been thinking like, okay, I'm going to buy these games.

843
01:10:27,241 --> 01:10:28,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I almost bought Fallout 3.

844
01:10:29,162 --> 01:10:32,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost bought... What was it?

845
01:10:32,404 --> 01:10:39,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Far Cry 3, Almost Bought, Rise of the Triad, because that was down to like $5.09.

846
01:10:39,926 --> 01:10:46,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Still might, I don't know, but I'm looking at my library of games I have and I'm like, I haven't played most of this stuff.

847
01:10:46,628 --> 01:10:48,549
[SPEAKER_03]: If I buy these, I'm not going to play them either.

848
01:10:48,589 --> 01:10:51,390
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to make a resolution of yourself like DarkSakura did.

849
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:53,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play one a week.

850
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:55,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not playing one a week.

851
01:10:55,312 --> 01:10:56,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's not going to happen.

852
01:10:56,533 --> 01:10:56,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

853
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,475
[SPEAKER_04]: The wife is expecting a new baby soon.

854
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:00,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that doesn't mean it.

855
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:01,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.

856
01:11:01,916 --> 01:11:03,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But that means more than you might think right now, Loki.

857
01:11:05,078 --> 01:11:05,358
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

858
01:11:05,398 --> 01:11:11,342
[SPEAKER_03]: But like Bioshock, for example, Bioshock Infinite came down to about $7 on Gamefly.

859
01:11:11,622 --> 01:11:13,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you know, I should just buy it for that.

860
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:16,305
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm like, no, I fucking played through it on Xbox 360 online.

861
01:11:17,185 --> 01:11:18,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I really going to play through the game again?

862
01:11:18,946 --> 01:11:19,166
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

863
01:11:19,287 --> 01:11:23,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I cluttering my fucking account with these games I'm never going to play?

864
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:25,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of where I'm at.

865
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:56,886
[SPEAKER_03]: but there is a nice gap between now and when more games are coming out so I do have time to catch up I do want to play more Grand Theft Auto 5 but my wife has been wanting to watch Hulu and she doesn't like the Playstation 3 controller because if you set it on the couch the right way or not the right way it accidentally taps one of those analog sticks and fast forwards and she throws a fit and I'm like fine so I don't want to play my 360 character to get it up to where my PS3 character is but

866
01:11:57,849 --> 01:11:59,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I may just have to go PS3 I guess.

867
01:12:00,765 --> 01:12:01,986
[SPEAKER_03]: DLC Quest DLC Quest DLC Quest

868
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:32,903
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

869
01:12:55,714 --> 01:13:22,047
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm in the middle of that right now the game is not really particularly difficult and at its core you've really played a game like this a thousand times because since the coin is you know the coins that used to get the quote-unquote DLC are just you know things you pick up in game we've all played that game where it's like now you have to get this item to go unlock this door now you need to get this item to get past this but you know it's we've all played a game like that before it's a very very common formula in games

870
01:13:22,367 --> 01:13:25,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not razzing this game for that because, again, it's a budget game.

871
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an indie game.

872
01:13:26,211 --> 01:13:26,991
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also pretty old, too.

873
01:13:27,251 --> 01:13:28,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it has been out a little while.

874
01:13:28,873 --> 01:13:33,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to remember it's more a commentary, and it does have a funny little script to it.

875
01:13:34,258 --> 01:13:36,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did LOL a few times.

876
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:45,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, for $1 or even $3 or whatever they're asking for it normally, it's a fine little evening jaunt through DLC Quest.

877
01:13:45,308 --> 01:13:46,609
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that one out.

878
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:54,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I also checked out a game called Spelunky, which I'd been wanting to check out for a long time, and then finally when it hit, what, four bucks or whatever it was, I was like, done.

879
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:56,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this game an awful lot.

880
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I am fucking terrible at it, but I find that I'm learning more and more.

881
01:14:00,744 --> 01:14:02,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna tell you what I love most about Spelunky.

882
01:14:02,986 --> 01:14:05,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a whore for roguelike games.

883
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:08,432
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the roguelike games, like back to the old school rogue and...

884
01:14:09,052 --> 01:14:11,515
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Rogue Legacy even is like a roguelike game, obviously.

885
01:14:12,135 --> 01:14:16,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Spelunky's kind of like that too, and you find more layers of the game as you progress.

886
01:14:16,799 --> 01:14:18,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oh, I've never seen this item before.

887
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:19,042
[SPEAKER_04]: What does this do?

888
01:14:19,462 --> 01:14:22,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, all the levels are randomly generated.

889
01:14:23,686 --> 01:14:32,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun, and one thing I love a lot about it is it really reminds me of a classic PC game, but kind of done in modern context.

890
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:33,835
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

891
01:14:49,685 --> 01:15:16,997
[SPEAKER_04]: but there are like challenge boards where one you know you'll have a certain level set that you can only play once per day and you go as far as you can and once you're done you're done there's a whole community around this game like live streams of people doing that and so forth so I enjoyed Spelunky I think I got it at a steal I think the game is worth whatever they're asking for normally like $15 or what have you right so Spelunky I will probably be talking about this game more in future weeks we have a little more time the last game I picked up

892
01:15:18,254 --> 01:15:21,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Gone Home I bought for $5 and it was on sale.

893
01:15:22,097 --> 01:15:23,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will tell you this.

894
01:15:24,018 --> 01:15:29,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I started Gone Home at about probably 9 o'clock on Friday night.

895
01:15:29,661 --> 01:15:31,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of said, all right, I need to check out this game finally.

896
01:15:31,783 --> 01:15:32,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I started playing it.

897
01:15:33,123 --> 01:15:40,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not get up out of my chair except maybe to use the restroom and get water until I beat the game at about 1 a.m.

898
01:15:40,488 --> 01:15:42,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played this thing from start to finish.

899
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really into it.

900
01:15:45,171 --> 01:15:49,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this, and this is probably a common thing you're going to hear about Gone Home.

901
01:15:50,293 --> 01:15:57,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really a game, but it's definitely an interactive story.

902
01:15:58,317 --> 01:16:03,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's best described, this is how I felt about it, it's like a first person movie.

903
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine you control the movie.

904
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:09,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what this game felt like to me.

905
01:16:09,763 --> 01:16:09,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

906
01:16:10,683 --> 01:16:34,907
[SPEAKER_04]: at its core it's not i could probably i'm not going to but i could probably spoil the whole damn thing for you in three sentences like the whole game i'm not going to do that because that would be a dick thing to do and i think watching the layers of it unfold it's not so much the punchline quote unquote like i could tell you those those three sentences that would ruin the game for you but at the same time i think it's about how we get to that

907
01:16:35,567 --> 01:16:44,790
[SPEAKER_04]: and all those really kind of unsettling things and the way things are presented in the game that really made this game a very special experience.

908
01:16:45,391 --> 01:16:53,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to say it's not for everybody because some people are going to play this and be like, wait a minute, this is not the game I was expecting at all.

909
01:16:54,634 --> 01:17:16,776
[SPEAKER_04]: so you got to be prepared that it's going to be a little bit more of a story that slowly unravels and there's really not like challenge to it per se uh there's no like there's no monster that's going to jump out from behind the curtain and eat you to death although you might get that impression from you know what you see about the game and so forth it's actually very much not like that at all my one

910
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:30,877
[SPEAKER_04]: issue with the game is that because I think it was trying to present itself one way and then kind of end up being another sort of story, I feel like there were things in a context that weren't fully explored.

911
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:36,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being vague on purpose because I don't want to ruin this for you, but I felt there were certain things that didn't really get explored enough.

912
01:17:37,059 --> 01:17:39,620
[SPEAKER_04]: When the game ended, I did feel resolution.

913
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:40,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt satisfaction.

914
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like, wow, that was a good movie I just watched.

915
01:17:43,861 --> 01:17:47,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt that when I finished the game, except I was like,

916
01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:48,222
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

917
01:18:12,074 --> 01:18:14,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the game normally is like what, 10 or 15?

918
01:18:15,376 --> 01:18:26,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to caution you, although I felt it was good and you would pay 10 or 15 for a movie, some people may not feel the value when it's only going to take you three to four hours to beat, if that.

919
01:18:26,881 --> 01:18:28,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you will probably fly through it faster than me.

920
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:57,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very OCD with the games and looking at every little corner which actually pays off in this game immensely I just want to kind of warn you that now there are some things they do to try to enhance the value like there's a director's commentary mode you can play through and so forth to try and encourage a second play and so on but I just want to warn you if you're expecting like oh I'm going to buy this game and it's going to give me hundreds of hours of satisfaction think of it more like a movie because that's kind of what it is it's more like an interactive movie but

921
01:18:58,783 --> 01:19:04,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of really love... How do I put my finger on this?

922
01:19:06,727 --> 01:19:12,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of love what I think this game may have started.

923
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,811
[SPEAKER_05]: That was incredibly distinct and clear.

924
01:19:15,623 --> 01:19:16,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

925
01:19:16,844 --> 01:19:28,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like this is going to be the first, or maybe not even the first, because I can think of other games I've played like this, but I think this is going to be a definitely notable, and you're seeing it getting Game of the Year nods and so forth and so on.

926
01:19:28,913 --> 01:19:37,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is going to be one of those games where we look back and we go, you know, this is the point that this art form really started to take off.

927
01:19:38,814 --> 01:19:39,074
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

928
01:19:58,647 --> 01:20:01,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll encourage you, don't go out there and spoil it for yourself.

929
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:06,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, it could be spoiled for you in three sentences, and there's some real dickheads that spoil it in comments and so forth.

930
01:20:06,856 --> 01:20:10,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think it's best experienced getting in there and doing it.

931
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:12,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, quickly, your gaming week.

932
01:20:13,423 --> 01:20:13,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

933
01:20:14,344 --> 01:20:22,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty light week because Monday through Wednesday we're spent wrapping up everything at work and then I've been around doing a lot of different things.

934
01:20:23,733 --> 01:20:30,479
[SPEAKER_05]: My sale haul was that I picked up a two-pack of Divekick and I needed to figure out what to do with the second copy.

935
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:36,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up Splunky as well, Final Fantasy VII, the Bioshock triple pack, and Counter-Strike Go...

936
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:43,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Still not entirely sure why, because I've never been good at that game or anything of the sort, but I have it.

937
01:20:44,074 --> 01:20:50,177
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ragenator has thanked me numerous times, both in chat, and then he mentioned it when he called into Bobby's show.

938
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf, 6 p.m.

939
01:20:52,718 --> 01:20:54,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Pacific on the VOG Network.

940
01:20:54,419 --> 01:20:54,539
[SPEAKER_05]: 5 p.m.

941
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:54,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Pacific.

942
01:20:55,719 --> 01:20:57,800
[SPEAKER_04]: 6pm the times when you're used to.

943
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:58,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So close.

944
01:21:00,101 --> 01:21:02,842
[SPEAKER_05]: As he sat on his call, I picked up the Saints Row pack for him.

945
01:21:02,922 --> 01:21:03,722
[SPEAKER_05]: He was talking about it.

946
01:21:03,802 --> 01:21:04,842
[SPEAKER_05]: He wanted some stuff to play.

947
01:21:05,463 --> 01:21:07,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It was dirt cheap and it is a lot of content.

948
01:21:07,884 --> 01:21:08,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoyed Saints Row 3.

949
01:21:09,704 --> 01:21:11,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So I threw the pack his way.

950
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:18,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've, because I've been moving around so much this week, I've actually gotten kind of back into the mobile swing of things again.

951
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:22,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up Sonic Dash, which is just an endless runner, time-killing kind of game.

952
01:21:23,412 --> 01:21:27,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've been very addicted to QuizUp in the last week or two, and me and Rob played around with that the other night.

953
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:28,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fun little iPhone game.

954
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:29,896
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a fun little iPhone game.

955
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:30,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Very fun.

956
01:21:30,337 --> 01:21:31,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very well curated.

957
01:21:31,998 --> 01:21:33,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means in 60 days we'll no longer be playing it.

958
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:35,160
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happens to iPhone games.

959
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:36,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was the other...

960
01:21:37,741 --> 01:21:38,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it just those two?

961
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:47,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there was a third game that I've been playing phone or iPad rather often, but probably just QuizUp and Sonic Dash.

962
01:21:47,525 --> 01:21:50,526
[SPEAKER_05]: The Usual Suspects, a little bit of Rogue Legacy, a little bit of FTL.

963
01:21:51,487 --> 01:21:59,030
[SPEAKER_05]: FTL randoms were abysmally terrible and I just got destroyed before I even hit the third sector.

964
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:06,973
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more power-ups in Rogue Legacy, still plowing through that, trying to get further, pick up more equipment, pieces of equipment and upgrades and all that.

965
01:22:07,133 --> 01:22:09,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

966
01:22:29,842 --> 01:22:50,166
[SPEAKER_04]: and so um and i've kind of been able to watch like oh how was it received this week and so forth so i kind of made a decision on how we're going to kind of treat the youtube thing going forward um so this is how it's going to work is that um we will post the episodes to youtube obviously they will not be videos they're just going to be audio for archive purposes uh we will post the shows to youtube but we're going to post them on a one week delay

967
01:22:50,746 --> 01:22:52,087
[SPEAKER_04]: and you might be thinking like, what?

968
01:22:52,127 --> 01:22:52,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you do that?

969
01:22:53,248 --> 01:23:01,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because I love the idea of like YouTube for like the archive purposes and so forth and kind of being able to go find your favorite parts of the show and so forth and all that.

970
01:23:02,313 --> 01:23:04,374
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to just keep it real with you guys.

971
01:23:06,095 --> 01:23:08,537
[SPEAKER_04]: We want the hits at orangeentrader.com and vognetwork.com.

972
01:23:10,178 --> 01:23:13,139
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube is great for discovery and so forth and branching out to that audience.

973
01:23:13,599 --> 01:23:27,006
[SPEAKER_04]: But it really helps us in being able to sell the show as media and help with events and so forth if we can get the hits with OrangeLoungeRadio.com and so forth.

974
01:23:27,066 --> 01:23:33,509
[SPEAKER_04]: So the podcast and Stitcher and TuneIn and those sorts of apps that tap into the official podcast feed...

975
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:37,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the ways we sort of prefer that people listen to the show.

976
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:40,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the ones that we're going to support with the immediate Sunday night uploads.

977
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:44,837
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will continue to support YouTube on the delay.

978
01:23:45,597 --> 01:23:57,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this, though, just so that if you're like a YouTube dedicated person, I don't want you to get upset because definitely we're exploring what are other ways we can actually get involved with actual video on YouTube.

979
01:23:57,185 --> 01:23:59,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've been doing that a lot through my own channel.

980
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Plug, plug, Rob Roberts Plays.

981
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:01,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Plug, plug.

982
01:24:01,849 --> 01:24:11,799
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm sure there will be more stuff to come in the future so stay tuned for things that aren't just audio archives of the show and hopefully some more interactive content over on the YouTube

983
01:24:12,765 --> 01:24:15,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

984
01:24:15,567 --> 01:24:18,748
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try to move through it quickly because we're already an hour and 20 minutes into the show.

985
01:24:19,048 --> 01:24:20,109
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll try to get through this quickly.

986
01:24:20,569 --> 01:24:22,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, why don't you start us off with some news tonight?

987
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:33,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so as we mentioned last week, there have been some people using Playroom on the PlayStation 4 as a means to kind of broadcast themselves.

988
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:36,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost like a talk show format or whatever.

989
01:24:36,998 --> 01:24:38,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people have been abusing that to...

990
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:47,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Broadcast themselves doing pornographic things, which I'm personally fine with, but apparently Twitch isn't.

991
01:24:47,706 --> 01:24:58,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So because of that, Twitch has momentarily removed the Playroom content from the directory, because they say the majority of it was non-gaming related content.

992
01:24:58,925 --> 01:25:00,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

993
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:19,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this is, I mean, there was a part of me that was like, oh, that's so frustrating.

994
01:25:19,413 --> 01:25:22,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not that I'm like sitting here going, oh, Twitch shouldn't have done that.

995
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:25,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they kind of had to because people were, you know, abusing it or whatever.

996
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:31,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was just like, damn, it really sucks that there wasn't a way to really kind of manage that.

997
01:25:32,222 --> 01:25:34,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what you could do.

998
01:25:34,244 --> 01:25:37,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the whole infamous TTP joke we make everywhere.

999
01:25:37,586 --> 01:25:41,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Here on Orange Lounge Radio where you put a new peripheral out there and what's the time to penis?

1000
01:25:42,308 --> 01:25:45,869
[SPEAKER_04]: How long before somebody puts their dick in it or shows their dick on it or so forth?

1001
01:25:46,329 --> 01:25:47,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Or draws a dick.

1002
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:47,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1003
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:53,672
[SPEAKER_04]: As we found with this, it wasn't very long at all and that's why it's gotten pulled and so forth.

1004
01:25:53,692 --> 01:25:56,313
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some really disgusting things that were going on on Playroom.

1005
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:58,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not just talking about showing body parts.

1006
01:25:58,274 --> 01:25:59,735
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some really disgusting things happening.

1007
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:00,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw them.

1008
01:26:00,795 --> 01:26:13,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, well, so I understand completely why they pulled it, but damn it, because there was some great potential there for people to start their own homegrown broadcasts and get voices out there and so forth.

1009
01:26:13,803 --> 01:26:23,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you could still do that on Ustream, so I would encourage you, if you were one of those people that was like, shit, I could have used Playroom to start my podcast or to start my video show.

1010
01:26:24,389 --> 01:26:26,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let that discourage you completely.

1011
01:26:26,651 --> 01:26:28,793
[SPEAKER_04]: You could feasibly still do Ustream.

1012
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:30,994
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a little harder to build an audience, but you know what?

1013
01:26:31,975 --> 01:26:32,996
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to start somewhere.

1014
01:26:33,536 --> 01:26:36,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could probably get drivers for the camera eventually.

1015
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'll happen too.

1016
01:26:39,301 --> 01:26:44,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that has a special adapter for it, though, or a special proprietary plug or something.

1017
01:26:44,645 --> 01:26:46,367
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know they'll come out with something.

1018
01:26:46,407 --> 01:26:50,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they did it with the Kinect and stuff so that...

1019
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:56,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, it doesn't probably cost too much to get, you know, some sort of webcam.

1020
01:26:56,495 --> 01:27:00,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of computers have webcams built into them or even laptops and stuff.

1021
01:27:00,718 --> 01:27:08,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I wouldn't say... If you can afford a, you know, PlayStation 4, you probably could afford a, you know, a webcam if you really wanted to do that.

1022
01:27:08,344 --> 01:27:08,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1023
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:13,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, and I'm all for more voices, more broadcasting getting out there.

1024
01:27:13,147 --> 01:27:14,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So just, you know, kind of on a side note, but...

1025
01:27:15,754 --> 01:27:16,935
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1026
01:27:32,592 --> 01:27:35,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been some changes with Miiverse that happened this past week.

1027
01:27:35,953 --> 01:27:38,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously this is to support this whole consolidation.

1028
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:41,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Some new display options in the community list.

1029
01:27:41,675 --> 01:27:43,575
[SPEAKER_04]: You can display more communities at once.

1030
01:27:43,635 --> 01:27:50,337
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also going to be communities based on categories like Wii U software, Virtual Console, and assumably 3DS and so on.

1031
01:27:50,877 --> 01:27:58,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Your profile will no longer display the total number of yas you've given, which was basically how many inches your Nintendo e-peen was.

1032
01:27:58,599 --> 01:27:59,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It was right there on your profile.

1033
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:01,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how many people have clicked like on my posts?

1034
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,861
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not there anymore, so there's no more competition, I suppose.

1035
01:28:05,201 --> 01:28:07,462
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still see your yas on individual posts.

1036
01:28:09,143 --> 01:28:12,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the default display setting in the community.

1037
01:28:12,164 --> 01:28:16,086
[SPEAKER_04]: When you entered the community before, you would see everybody's posts.

1038
01:28:16,526 --> 01:28:21,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it defaults to only showing you posts from people who've actually played the game.

1039
01:28:22,108 --> 01:28:36,308
[SPEAKER_04]: you can take that out and look at every post if you want to but I kind of understand that change I do, you want the discussion to be people who have actually played the game it's unfortunate for the people who might be popping in there to ask would I like this game

1040
01:28:37,409 --> 01:28:38,189
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1041
01:28:55,575 --> 01:28:58,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's really doing that, and it is kind of neat, like when it works.

1042
01:28:59,518 --> 01:29:08,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, one other thing that is neat to be a part of, if you're lucky enough to be there, you might actually get a free Wii U console if you end up on the right Southwest Airlines flight.

1043
01:29:09,005 --> 01:29:10,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a Southwest Airlines flight.

1044
01:29:11,367 --> 01:29:13,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently Nintendo and Southwest Airlines partnered up.

1045
01:29:14,109 --> 01:29:17,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is like the official video game company of Southwest Airlines.

1046
01:29:17,832 --> 01:29:24,197
[SPEAKER_04]: There's gaming lounges in some of the heavy traffic Southwest airports, which would be what, like Las Vegas, I imagine has got to have something.

1047
01:29:25,097 --> 01:29:51,854
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're giving away games and so forth and Flight 1883 which went from New Orleans to Dallas Love Field last week they gave over 100 passengers a brand new Wii U console so it's just kind of different ways to I mean we might be sitting here looking at that going that's kind of weird but it's just different it's just different ways to market you know Sony's doing something about PS4 on Facebook so one of those reblog campaigns they gave away two of them at the Sharks game last night

1048
01:29:52,503 --> 01:29:52,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1049
01:29:53,184 --> 01:29:55,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and I'm sure an Xbox.

1050
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:59,551
[SPEAKER_04]: They went to some YouTubers' houses and were giving them Xbox.

1051
01:29:59,571 --> 01:30:02,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of their vocal critics were giving them Xbox Ones.

1052
01:30:02,034 --> 01:30:02,614
[SPEAKER_04]: That was interesting.

1053
01:30:02,634 --> 01:30:03,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis was the one that saw them.

1054
01:30:03,656 --> 01:30:05,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, they're not listening to our show.

1055
01:30:06,979 --> 01:30:07,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

1056
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,702
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the only reason you were so mad, Loki.

1057
01:30:09,722 --> 01:30:10,603
[SPEAKER_04]: You were just trying to get a free one.

1058
01:30:10,623 --> 01:30:11,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not mad at all.

1059
01:30:12,265 --> 01:30:15,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I'm not going to turn down free, but you know.

1060
01:30:16,008 --> 01:30:24,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so yeah, fly more Southwest, I suppose, if you want to possibly win a free Wii U. That's a good excuse to go Southwest as your airline.

1061
01:30:25,073 --> 01:30:28,496
[SPEAKER_13]: The most entertaining flights I've ever had were Southwest flights.

1062
01:30:29,156 --> 01:30:29,537
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1063
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:30,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just go to Disneyland a bunch.

1064
01:30:30,998 --> 01:30:42,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, see, again, we're not commercially endorsed, but I do have to give JetBlue a shout out because I do love those TVs because I flew cross-country and watched five hours of SpongeBob SquarePants.

1065
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Best flight I ever took to New York City.

1066
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:45,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that sounds awful.

1067
01:30:46,594 --> 01:30:47,174
[SPEAKER_13]: For the record.

1068
01:30:47,214 --> 01:30:47,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Haters gonna hate.

1069
01:30:48,195 --> 01:30:48,695
[SPEAKER_13]: For the record.

1070
01:30:48,755 --> 01:30:48,975
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1071
01:30:50,235 --> 01:30:50,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Crap, what was it?

1072
01:30:50,955 --> 01:30:51,736
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't Delta.

1073
01:30:51,876 --> 01:30:54,616
[SPEAKER_13]: It was something when I flew to Alabama.

1074
01:30:55,477 --> 01:30:56,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, the worst thing ever.

1075
01:30:57,017 --> 01:30:57,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It was American.

1076
01:30:57,977 --> 01:30:58,578
[SPEAKER_04]: US Air, I'm sure.

1077
01:30:58,998 --> 01:30:59,398
[SPEAKER_13]: American.

1078
01:30:59,418 --> 01:31:00,298
[SPEAKER_13]: American Airlines.

1079
01:31:01,078 --> 01:31:01,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Awful.

1080
01:31:02,119 --> 01:31:03,219
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, what do you have for us, DarkSakura?

1081
01:31:04,534 --> 01:31:05,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Have some crap.

1082
01:31:06,295 --> 01:31:07,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this is a bunch of crap.

1083
01:31:08,116 --> 01:31:11,759
[SPEAKER_13]: So, once again, Shenmue 3 ain't happening.

1084
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:16,161
[SPEAKER_13]: That whole trademark application?

1085
01:31:16,602 --> 01:31:17,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Fake!

1086
01:31:17,983 --> 01:31:19,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Sega's like, uh, no?

1087
01:31:20,444 --> 01:31:22,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't we tell you this for the last ten years?

1088
01:31:22,746 --> 01:31:23,046
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

1089
01:31:24,387 --> 01:31:29,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think there's a silver lining to this we'll get into later in the show, but... There's another fake, too.

1090
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:30,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, go ahead.

1091
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:30,931
[SPEAKER_13]: For Fallout 4.

1092
01:31:32,734 --> 01:31:34,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's going to happen eventually.

1093
01:31:34,936 --> 01:31:36,577
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know what's going to happen.

1094
01:31:36,597 --> 01:31:40,240
[SPEAKER_13]: But the one that's up right now has a fake trailer and everything.

1095
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,842
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1096
01:31:42,862 --> 01:31:48,326
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a ton of this with Blizzard-related products, too, of fake trademarks.

1097
01:31:48,386 --> 01:31:55,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the lesson we all need to learn from these various fake trademark stories, stop running with articles on TradeFia.

1098
01:31:55,931 --> 01:31:56,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stop.

1099
01:31:57,272 --> 01:31:59,975
[SPEAKER_04]: But trademarks don't mean anything anymore.

1100
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:03,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Trademarks, patents, probably something else too.

1101
01:32:03,778 --> 01:32:04,718
[SPEAKER_04]: IMDB pages.

1102
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:05,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

1103
01:32:05,379 --> 01:32:05,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, stop.

1104
01:32:06,039 --> 01:32:06,360
[SPEAKER_04]: All of it.

1105
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:07,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Not news sources.

1106
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:09,702
[SPEAKER_04]: These are no longer credible news sources.

1107
01:32:09,822 --> 01:32:10,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Done.

1108
01:32:10,103 --> 01:32:12,204
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying 4chan's not a reliable news source?

1109
01:32:13,505 --> 01:32:20,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to offend, but in places I think to go for gaming news, that's not really at the top of the list.

1110
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:25,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Biting gaming commentary, perhaps, but not for gaming news.

1111
01:32:26,363 --> 01:32:46,187
[SPEAKER_13]: For the record, Spongebob is the devil Whatever, hater He's not the devil, he's too dumb to be the devil Alright I seriously tried to watch an episode of that and I thought I could feel my brain melting It was awful It's just fucking Ren and Stimpy under the sea, that's all it is Ren and Stimpy was cool Do you hate Adventure Time too?

1112
01:32:46,347 --> 01:32:50,348
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I love Adventure Time I don't get you, because I love Adventure Time too

1113
01:32:50,908 --> 01:33:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: but I heard the game is not so great a friend told me that the game is like it's only fun if you have like multiplayer but like a single player it's the the why are we in the dungeon I don't know or whatever that game is called I've heard it's great for multiplayer but for single players I almost picked it up yeah yeah if we find it on sale we should do a multiplayer I found a used copy well tell me just tell me which system you guys get it on and I'll bug my d3 rep to give me a copy because he loves me so

1114
01:33:17,617 --> 01:33:19,318
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you get three copies?

1115
01:33:19,518 --> 01:33:20,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think that's going to work.

1116
01:33:21,499 --> 01:33:21,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Or four.

1117
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:22,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason wants one too.

1118
01:33:22,919 --> 01:33:23,219
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1119
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:25,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's travel around the world and check out release dates.

1120
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,001
[SPEAKER_04]: There might not be a lot, but we'll try anyway.

1121
01:33:28,041 --> 01:33:28,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Release dates.

1122
01:33:29,002 --> 01:33:30,902
[SPEAKER_03]: This is easy because I already memorized this one.

1123
01:33:31,002 --> 01:33:33,003
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one game coming out this week, and that's Gran Turismo 6.

1124
01:33:33,403 --> 01:33:34,064
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's on Friday.

1125
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:34,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1126
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:36,004
[SPEAKER_03]: On PlayStation 3.

1127
01:33:36,645 --> 01:33:37,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of cars.

1128
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:40,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty big game.

1129
01:33:41,186 --> 01:33:42,587
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have to wait three years.

1130
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:46,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and so it will actually be happening.

1131
01:33:46,442 --> 01:33:50,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, how can we prove to Bobby Blackwolf that the game will actually be coming out?

1132
01:33:50,448 --> 01:33:52,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he doesn't think Gran Turismo 5 ever happened.

1133
01:33:53,506 --> 01:33:54,567
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually happening.

1134
01:33:54,707 --> 01:33:55,627
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't been delayed.

1135
01:33:55,767 --> 01:34:02,650
[SPEAKER_03]: They announced it was coming out, you know, quarter four 2013 and we're in quarter four 2013.

1136
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:03,251
[SPEAKER_03]: No delays.

1137
01:34:03,351 --> 01:34:04,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're all good.

1138
01:34:05,412 --> 01:34:10,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we need to do is we need everybody to go to like, you know, your local game store, wherever it is.

1139
01:34:10,634 --> 01:34:15,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you see Gran Turismo 6 sitting on the shelf, you need to take a picture of it and put it on Twitter.

1140
01:34:15,656 --> 01:34:17,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag believe me, Bobby.

1141
01:34:19,798 --> 01:34:21,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can drive in the moon.

1142
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the fuck out.

1143
01:34:23,711 --> 01:34:24,492
[SPEAKER_03]: You can drive on the moon?

1144
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,213
[SPEAKER_03]: You can drive on the moon.

1145
01:34:27,435 --> 01:34:28,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Moon Patrol?

1146
01:34:28,736 --> 01:34:33,021
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they have a moon... You have a moon lander that you can drive, and there's actual achievements for driving on the moon.

1147
01:34:33,361 --> 01:34:37,465
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could have aliens and Bill Clinton in a hot tub at the end of Cruisin' World, then, you know...

1148
01:34:40,368 --> 01:34:42,289
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, going to Japan.

1149
01:34:42,909 --> 01:34:45,150
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a little more to look forward to this week.

1150
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:48,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Gran Turismo 6 is there as well, but there's some other games as well.

1151
01:34:48,691 --> 01:34:51,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Gear Rising Revengeance gets a special edition on the PlayStation 3.

1152
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:56,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Daikokai Jidai Online Gran Atlus is released this week.

1153
01:34:56,673 --> 01:35:00,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaihou Shoujuu Sin in regular and limited edition also this week.

1154
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:03,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are Gran Turismo 6 PlayStation 3 bundles this week.

1155
01:35:03,795 --> 01:35:06,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in Japan, you've been holding out on a PlayStation 3 bundle.

1156
01:35:07,356 --> 01:35:09,258
[SPEAKER_04]: and maybe this is the game that's going to do it for you.

1157
01:35:09,839 --> 01:35:12,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe me, Bobby, it's out in Japan this week.

1158
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:13,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1159
01:35:13,463 --> 01:35:16,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, The Walking Dead comes out in Japan.

1160
01:35:16,667 --> 01:35:18,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this the... I'm trying to look real quick.

1161
01:35:18,969 --> 01:35:21,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is the Telltale version, the good one.

1162
01:35:22,213 --> 01:35:23,074
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1163
01:35:43,217 --> 01:35:48,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's an Xbox 360 Slim with a 320 gig hard drive being released this week.

1164
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:50,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what that's in celebration of.

1165
01:35:51,081 --> 01:35:53,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Just an excuse to get another 360 on the shelf, I suppose.

1166
01:35:55,084 --> 01:35:57,665
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Vita this week, Batman Arkham Origins is there as well.

1167
01:35:57,865 --> 01:36:02,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a new lime green, white, pink, black, and light blue, white Vitas.

1168
01:36:02,788 --> 01:36:04,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Those models are making their way out this week.

1169
01:36:04,809 --> 01:36:07,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Tearaway, which has been getting really good reviews over here.

1170
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:08,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it myself yet.

1171
01:36:09,031 --> 01:36:10,152
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1172
01:36:34,651 --> 01:36:36,292
[SPEAKER_04]: and the answer may be never unfortunately.

1173
01:36:36,652 --> 01:36:57,558
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the Nintendo 3DS, Bravely Default for the sequel, Geist Crusher, Inazuma 11 Go, Galaxy Big Bang and Galaxy Supernova and some Hello Kitty purses and pouches for your 3DS LL or XL but LL in Japan are released this week because you know you want a My Melody pouch in pink or red.

1174
01:36:57,578 --> 01:36:59,118
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I want a Duffy case.

1175
01:37:00,058 --> 01:37:01,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me a Duffy case for my DS.

1176
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:02,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.

1177
01:37:03,023 --> 01:37:04,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, those are the releases in Japan.

1178
01:37:04,408 --> 01:37:06,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So a much busier week in Japan than here in the States.

1179
01:37:06,254 --> 01:37:06,676
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the UK?

1180
01:37:07,068 --> 01:37:07,749
[SPEAKER_13]: A little busier.

1181
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:20,881
[SPEAKER_13]: On the 4th we have Dark Out for PC, on the 5th Space Hulk on iPad, Speedball 2 HD, SteamWorld Dig for Mac and PC, and Bravely Default for the sequel on 3DS.

1182
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:31,491
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on the 6th is Scribblenauts Unlimited for 3DS and Wii U. Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

1183
01:37:31,551 --> 01:37:32,272
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, Loki.

1184
01:37:33,635 --> 01:37:38,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I just realized that Just Cause 2 multiplayer is coming back or is coming to Steam.

1185
01:37:38,917 --> 01:37:40,218
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking awesome.

1186
01:37:40,478 --> 01:37:44,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So seriously, buy Just Cause 2 if you haven't already because it's like two bucks.

1187
01:37:46,241 --> 01:37:48,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Multiplayer with like a thousand people at a time.

1188
01:37:49,362 --> 01:37:51,443
[SPEAKER_03]: You're giving an awful lot of endorsements tonight.

1189
01:37:52,944 --> 01:38:01,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's a sandbox game with guns and vehicles and stuff and grappling hooks with a thousand people at one time.

1190
01:38:03,441 --> 01:38:05,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, that sounds fucking awesome.

1191
01:38:05,308 --> 01:38:06,492
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Grand Theft Auto should have been.

1192
01:38:07,074 --> 01:38:08,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with grappling hooks.

1193
01:38:08,439 --> 01:38:08,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

1194
01:38:11,102 --> 01:38:19,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So Microsoft, of course, they're going to be launching the Xbox One in Japan later on in 2014.

1195
01:38:20,987 --> 01:38:34,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And to go along with that, they are teaming up with some developers, or Japanese developers to be exact, to offer some games that may be exclusive to the Xbox One platform.

1196
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:36,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, those haven't been revealed yet.

1197
01:38:37,156 --> 01:39:04,371
[SPEAKER_03]: but um they will be full Japanese games and not like you know digital games like Panzer Dragoon or something like that and of course uh announcements coming later on about that I'm not sure where they're supposed to announcement or you know announce all that stuff but um soon hopefully since I want to say they're launching in the spring I may be thinking PlayStation 3 but

1198
01:39:06,912 --> 01:39:07,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1199
01:39:07,292 --> 01:39:07,953
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

1200
01:39:09,655 --> 01:39:12,397
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it seems like they're taking it kind of seriously.

1201
01:39:13,358 --> 01:39:21,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe kind of a turnaround from what we saw in the 360 where Microsoft really wants to get their foot in Japan, Japanese households.

1202
01:39:21,245 --> 01:39:25,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll see something like we saw with Blue Dragon and stuff like that.

1203
01:39:25,889 --> 01:39:27,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe something along those lines.

1204
01:39:27,771 --> 01:39:36,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine, too, this is timed because the Xbox One is not out in Japan, but perhaps they're going to start, you know, before it's released there in 2014, they're going to really start to get some of this news out here.

1205
01:39:36,477 --> 01:39:41,881
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to leverage Square Enix to give them another Dragon Quest game, maybe Dragon Quest, you know, was it... 11?

1206
01:39:41,921 --> 01:39:42,441
[SPEAKER_03]: 11 or something.

1207
01:39:42,762 --> 01:39:45,183
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be on 11 now, because they're probably not going to get 10.

1208
01:39:45,464 --> 01:39:46,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, never say never.

1209
01:39:47,385 --> 01:39:53,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And if Microsoft reverses its policies, Microsoft could get Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, too.

1210
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:56,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It's known that Square Enix wanted to do it for 360.

1211
01:39:56,231 --> 01:39:56,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1212
01:39:57,932 --> 01:40:12,837
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's just Microsoft's the one that did not but they will not budge on the cross servers thing and I props to Square Enix for not budging on that so it'll be interesting if they can kind of sit together at the table they did it for 11 they can do it for 14 that would be interesting very interesting all right um

1213
01:40:13,957 --> 01:40:23,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Also interesting of note news coming out of Japan, Super Mario 3D World, the sales figures are in, and well, unfortunately it doesn't look great.

1214
01:40:24,359 --> 01:40:26,780
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some conflicting reports about how much it sold.

1215
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:38,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Media Create says they sold just under 100,000 units of Super Mario 3D World, and Famitsu says it was about 107K, so either way you're looking at about 100,000 sold.

1216
01:40:39,263 --> 01:40:41,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing to put that into perspective.

1217
01:40:41,884 --> 01:40:43,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario 3D Land

1218
01:40:44,404 --> 01:40:46,906
[SPEAKER_04]: 344,000.

1219
01:40:44,685 --> 01:40:46,906
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the 3DS one.

1220
01:40:47,526 --> 01:40:54,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Sunshine, 280,000, which of the modern games, it seems like Sunshine gets dumped on the most.

1221
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:55,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just throwing it out there.

1222
01:40:56,591 --> 01:40:59,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario 64 on the 3DS, the remake, 120,000.

1223
01:41:01,414 --> 01:41:03,616
[SPEAKER_04]: still sold more than Super Mario 3D World.

1224
01:41:03,696 --> 01:41:08,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm not saying this... Are those, like, lifetime sales, or is that just... No, no, first week sales.

1225
01:41:08,439 --> 01:41:09,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all first week sales.

1226
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:09,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, God.

1227
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, all those games sold over a million, except for Sunshine, actually didn't, in Japan.

1228
01:41:15,223 --> 01:41:18,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunshine ended with $789,000 and change.

1229
01:41:18,265 --> 01:41:19,026
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

1230
01:41:19,426 --> 01:41:24,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want this to be like, oh, we're kicking Nintendo while they're down, or the sky is falling, or whatever.

1231
01:41:24,649 --> 01:41:27,411
[SPEAKER_04]: But I bring this up because, you know, I...

1232
01:41:28,812 --> 01:41:32,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo ain't going bankrupt, so stop those rumors and that shit.

1233
01:41:32,055 --> 01:41:34,157
[SPEAKER_12]: They survived the Virtual Boy, they'll survive this.

1234
01:41:34,437 --> 01:41:38,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to mention, the numbers are on VG Charts for North America.

1235
01:41:38,481 --> 01:41:38,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, are they?

1236
01:41:38,922 --> 01:41:39,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know they were out yet.

1237
01:41:39,983 --> 01:41:41,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they're always a week behind, but 243,000.

1238
01:41:42,225 --> 01:41:42,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, okay.

1239
01:41:42,725 --> 01:41:45,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1240
01:41:45,588 --> 01:41:48,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not exactly a bust.

1241
01:41:48,711 --> 01:41:50,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe, did it come out over there in Europe?

1242
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:51,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1243
01:41:52,114 --> 01:41:52,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe...

1244
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:56,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it did not come out over there.

1245
01:41:57,362 --> 01:41:57,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet.

1246
01:41:58,123 --> 01:41:58,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet.

1247
01:41:58,303 --> 01:42:02,206
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a very interesting silver lining is that it sold twice as many in the U.S.

1248
01:42:02,266 --> 01:42:02,927
[SPEAKER_04]: as it did in Japan.

1249
01:42:02,967 --> 01:42:03,848
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very interesting.

1250
01:42:04,048 --> 01:42:04,928
[SPEAKER_04]: More than twice as many.

1251
01:42:04,968 --> 01:42:05,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1252
01:42:05,569 --> 01:42:07,030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's giving me weird dates here.

1253
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:07,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1254
01:42:07,651 --> 01:42:12,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, they're saying 101, 798 is in Japan.

1255
01:42:12,915 --> 01:42:16,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to check Europe again because it's giving me a weird date.

1256
01:42:16,578 --> 01:42:16,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they don't.

1257
01:42:17,058 --> 01:42:17,719
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's it.

1258
01:42:17,739 --> 01:42:18,839
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have last week.

1259
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,541
[SPEAKER_03]: They only have up to the 16th.

1260
01:42:22,382 --> 01:42:32,849
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem that people are really identifying with this is that for the install base of the Wii, and this is important to say, for the install base that the Wii U has currently, we all know the Wii U is struggling a little bit, it's no secret.

1261
01:42:33,209 --> 01:42:35,911
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the install base that the Wii U has, those numbers aren't bad.

1262
01:42:36,672 --> 01:42:42,476
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem is the game was expected to push more Wii U sales, and we're not seeing that really happen in Japan yet.

1263
01:42:43,536 --> 01:43:05,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I think it's a little too early to say the sky is falling completely, but I think there are a lot of us that are rooting for Nintendo and really hope they can turn it around, but it's gonna... I really wish they had had a second game like this to really kick... I mean, they certainly have it on the 3DS, but I wish they had another game to kind of kick out the gate this winter with this to really get people talking.

1264
01:43:05,602 --> 01:43:10,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you could say Zelda Wind Waker, but again, just something kind of new.

1265
01:43:10,603 --> 01:43:10,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1266
01:43:11,223 --> 01:43:11,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I just...

1267
01:43:13,005 --> 01:43:16,252
[SPEAKER_04]: to really push those Wii U units because I definitely don't want to see Nintendo fail.

1268
01:43:16,372 --> 01:43:16,893
[SPEAKER_04]: None of us do.

1269
01:43:17,674 --> 01:43:18,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the thing.

1270
01:43:18,336 --> 01:43:23,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious to see what they're selling as far as Wii U systems because...

1271
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:31,674
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good that they sold those games, but I'm sure that they have more than 200,000 Wii U systems out there.

1272
01:43:32,495 --> 01:43:36,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd just be curious to see how that's actually translating to new sales.

1273
01:43:37,279 --> 01:43:37,719
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1274
01:43:37,759 --> 01:43:51,931
[SPEAKER_04]: A very interesting point in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com made by Dungeon Buster, who says Lightning Returns also sold considerably less in its release window in Japan when compared to Final Fantasy XIII too, which was lower in opening sales than Final Fantasy XIII.

1275
01:43:52,691 --> 01:43:56,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It just sounds like the sales were soft for titles in general in Japan.

1276
01:43:57,154 --> 01:43:59,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And Legends, I'll link between worlds, 294,000.

1277
01:43:59,816 --> 01:44:04,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like, you know, that's through the 23rd.

1278
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:05,940
[SPEAKER_03]: That's day one sales.

1279
01:44:07,061 --> 01:44:08,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised that that game's amazing.

1280
01:44:10,684 --> 01:44:15,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And SJ100Matt says the game came out at a bad time with all the new consoles coming out now.

1281
01:44:16,067 --> 01:44:16,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Japan, though.

1282
01:44:17,508 --> 01:44:20,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, Japan didn't have a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One until next year.

1283
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:20,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1284
01:44:21,691 --> 01:44:23,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox One, no, but it was still imminent for the PlayStation 4.

1285
01:44:24,013 --> 01:44:27,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Nintendo's kind of competing against themselves in a way in Japan right now with 3DS.

1286
01:44:27,757 --> 01:44:35,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sure, Sony's trying to up the presence with the Vita, and it's somewhat working, but Nintendo's biggest enemy in a way is the 3DS.

1287
01:44:36,865 --> 01:44:37,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming on the go.

1288
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:40,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't underestimate how huge gaming on the go is over there.

1289
01:44:40,528 --> 01:44:45,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously, considering all the devices that you kids are all distracting yourselves with right now.

1290
01:44:46,086 --> 01:44:47,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

1291
01:44:48,127 --> 01:44:48,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly.

1292
01:44:50,008 --> 01:44:53,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not this week, but to your credit, you don't have Animal Crossing right now.

1293
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:55,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in my purse.

1294
01:44:55,991 --> 01:44:57,772
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have Zelda plugged in right now, actually.

1295
01:44:57,792 --> 01:45:00,733
[SPEAKER_13]: I... No.

1296
01:45:01,093 --> 01:45:01,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1297
01:45:01,594 --> 01:45:01,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1298
01:45:01,954 --> 01:45:02,574
[SPEAKER_13]: I should log in.

1299
01:45:03,334 --> 01:45:03,715
[SPEAKER_05]: You should.

1300
01:45:03,955 --> 01:45:04,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Should open the gate.

1301
01:45:05,455 --> 01:45:29,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely agree with that point that it's trending mobile and when you're trying to hold on to the same issue with PC desktops and everything else these older inflexible, yeah they may have more features but you cannot play them anywhere else without difficulty you're right, mobile is the up and comer and it will be biting sales out from a lot of other things

1302
01:45:30,766 --> 01:45:56,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we'll see, I mean again, week one, let's see how this game does through the holiday season, we'll see But it could be very interesting to see what this is gonna have Nintendo doing in 2014 But you know what, it's not over, it ain't over Alright, let's move on, you know what, let's move back to a classic time when we didn't fucking stress on how well a game sold Because we didn't find out for like three months, because we got all our news from magazines

1303
01:45:57,133 --> 01:45:58,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder what's up with Jason's monkey hat

1304
01:46:01,377 --> 01:46:02,097
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, which pick tonight?

1305
01:46:02,137 --> 01:46:05,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked Marble Madness just because I had that stupid level 2 music stuck in my head.

1306
01:46:30,245 --> 01:46:35,050
[SPEAKER_04]: How have you never picked this game before?

1307
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:35,370
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.

1308
01:46:35,410 --> 01:46:40,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I was never a super fan of Marble Madness because it pisses me off!

1309
01:46:41,175 --> 01:46:44,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, very loud dongs from Marble Madness.

1310
01:46:44,799 --> 01:46:45,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys.

1311
01:46:46,059 --> 01:46:48,622
[SPEAKER_13]: The best music was the level 2 music for the record.

1312
01:46:49,743 --> 01:46:55,348
[SPEAKER_13]: At any rate, it was designed by Mark Kearney and it came out in 1984.

1313
01:46:55,389 --> 01:46:56,189
[SPEAKER_13]: It was an arcade game.

1314
01:46:57,270 --> 01:47:00,794
[SPEAKER_13]: It was one of the most innovative games when it came out.

1315
01:47:00,894 --> 01:47:08,161
[SPEAKER_13]: It used the Atari System 1 hardware and programmed in C. One of the first games to be programmed in C on that hardware.

1316
01:47:09,383 --> 01:47:12,185
[SPEAKER_13]: It was also the first to use true stereo sound.

1317
01:47:12,706 --> 01:47:15,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Previous ones used simulated stereo or mono.

1318
01:47:16,490 --> 01:47:21,695
[SPEAKER_13]: So this one basically, in fact, I'm actually just going to pull this quote right here.

1319
01:47:22,316 --> 01:47:30,385
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, the designer drew inspiration from many golf racing games and MC Escher, which we can totally see where that came from.

1320
01:47:31,125 --> 01:47:39,848
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically the way you play Marble Madness is you are a little marble and you work your marble through mazes of different kind.

1321
01:47:41,368 --> 01:47:49,351
[SPEAKER_13]: But you use a trackball, although home versions used different controllers with directional pads, which is probably why I hated playing it on the NES.

1322
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:54,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so yeah, you have a different, you know, you can do practice.

1323
01:47:54,166 --> 01:47:54,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Each one has a theme.

1324
01:47:54,907 --> 01:48:04,118
[SPEAKER_13]: There's even like a backwards level where, uh, you go up instead of, uh, uh, you know, the usual down the course, uh, type of method.

1325
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:08,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, the other thing with this one too is that, um,

1326
01:48:10,518 --> 01:48:15,361
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just a really freaking bizarre and neat game for its time.

1327
01:48:15,481 --> 01:48:21,005
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, what was, I'm trying to think of what the word I'm trying to think of for the perspective.

1328
01:48:22,166 --> 01:48:22,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Isometric.

1329
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:23,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, isometric.

1330
01:48:24,908 --> 01:48:26,308
[SPEAKER_13]: It uses an isometric perspective.

1331
01:48:26,909 --> 01:48:28,110
[SPEAKER_13]: You're looking at it on a diagonal.

1332
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:31,552
[SPEAKER_13]: It simulates a feeling of three dimensions very nicely.

1333
01:48:31,792 --> 01:48:39,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm just watching this awesome badass playing it here on YouTube, and he's in that upside-down level right now, and I'm just remembering what a mindfuck that level was.

1334
01:48:40,057 --> 01:48:44,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, gravity goes the other way, and you don't know how bad that messes with you until you play it.

1335
01:48:46,498 --> 01:48:50,482
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the whole game was just such a neat game.

1336
01:48:51,202 --> 01:48:53,925
[SPEAKER_13]: And on top of that, this is an arcade when he's doing it with a trackball.

1337
01:48:53,945 --> 01:48:57,268
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to play this game with a trackball if you want to play it with any kind of accuracy.

1338
01:48:58,008 --> 01:49:03,413
[SPEAKER_13]: I do believe I actually have this on Atari 5200, I want to say, because we've got a trackball.

1339
01:49:05,334 --> 01:49:10,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, moving back into some of the background on the game.

1340
01:49:10,859 --> 01:49:20,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, the guy who was working on this was supposed to be doing a video game version of Thriller, Michael Jackson's Thriller, and it was cancelled, so they moved into Marble Madness.

1341
01:49:20,869 --> 01:49:27,515
[SPEAKER_13]: This particular one, at its time, was using a 19-inch CRT monitor and a Motorola 68010 central processing unit.

1342
01:49:30,597 --> 01:49:35,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just basically was pretty tech-heavy for its time.

1343
01:49:35,381 --> 01:49:36,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it was at the edge.

1344
01:49:37,702 --> 01:49:42,466
[SPEAKER_13]: So as far as other... And there's actually... There are whole...

1345
01:49:44,884 --> 01:49:47,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Just different kinds of programming tricks that went into this game.

1346
01:49:48,126 --> 01:49:52,629
[SPEAKER_13]: It did shadows to control anti-aliasing.

1347
01:49:52,869 --> 01:49:55,350
[SPEAKER_13]: It did light ray tracing.

1348
01:49:55,410 --> 01:50:00,073
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the technology behind this game, it's a programming marvel for its time, I mean, to be honest.

1349
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:07,758
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually, I believe, a whole site full of nothing but concept sketches that went behind this and the programming direction.

1350
01:50:08,198 --> 01:50:08,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Really neat stuff.

1351
01:50:09,899 --> 01:50:12,282
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was a big commercial success.

1352
01:50:12,682 --> 01:50:17,928
[SPEAKER_13]: There were 4,000 cabinets sold and it was its highest earning game in arcades at the time.

1353
01:50:18,128 --> 01:50:20,530
[SPEAKER_13]: But then it fell after seven weeks.

1354
01:50:22,873 --> 01:50:24,955
[SPEAKER_13]: And really it was because it's such a short game.

1355
01:50:25,335 --> 01:50:27,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And people just got frustrated to hell.

1356
01:50:30,197 --> 01:50:57,322
[SPEAKER_13]: um really the lot of thing is that because it took such a high level of skill to play that's what made it really just an attractive game to have an attractive game to play so with that too there were other versions and a potential sequel and I will go ahead and put this out there I think that Super Monkey Ball was definitely influenced by this game

1357
01:50:58,722 --> 01:51:04,806
[SPEAKER_13]: So as far as other versions, there was a Tiger Electronics handheld LCD game, which I had.

1358
01:51:05,567 --> 01:51:08,269
[SPEAKER_13]: And Rare released the Nintendo version.

1359
01:51:10,991 --> 01:51:12,091
[SPEAKER_13]: They were all very simple.

1360
01:51:12,171 --> 01:51:15,474
[SPEAKER_13]: They weren't as great, clearly, as the arcade one.

1361
01:51:16,815 --> 01:51:23,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Other versions that came out were the Amiga, Game Boy, Sega Mega Drive, the Spectrum, PC, and GBA versions.

1362
01:51:24,841 --> 01:51:26,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Marvel Madness 2

1363
01:51:41,484 --> 01:51:45,326
[SPEAKER_13]: It was in development by Kearney's partner for the first one, Bob Flanagan.

1364
01:51:47,488 --> 01:51:58,436
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was supposed to expand, have invisibility, flight modes, pinball games set in between the levels, and three-player isometric racing.

1365
01:51:59,436 --> 01:52:01,698
[SPEAKER_13]: But it just didn't happen.

1366
01:52:02,098 --> 01:52:08,042
[SPEAKER_13]: There were prototypes that were out for location testing, but you know what it was going against at the time?

1367
01:52:09,404 --> 01:52:24,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Street Fighter 2 and that was also in testing at the time so yeah so they went off of that and went to Guardians of the Hood instead which is a beat-em-up game but there are the prototypes exist and you can find I'm sure you can find ROMs of them so

1368
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:28,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to see what people think about it.

1369
01:52:28,763 --> 01:52:34,567
[SPEAKER_13]: But as far as, I mean, there were some spiritual successors too.

1370
01:52:34,647 --> 01:52:38,110
[SPEAKER_13]: I said Super Monkey Ball kind of doing the successor thing.

1371
01:52:38,691 --> 01:52:45,016
[SPEAKER_13]: There was Archer McLean's Mercury, Switch Ball, Never Ball, Marble Blast Gold.

1372
01:52:45,537 --> 01:52:47,358
[SPEAKER_13]: That's on Linux and Mac OS and Windows.

1373
01:52:47,378 --> 01:52:48,039
[SPEAKER_13]: It came out in 2003.

1374
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:51,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Ballance, and I'm saying that because there's two L's in it.

1375
01:52:53,582 --> 01:52:55,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Just all kinds of different ones.

1376
01:52:56,343 --> 01:52:57,304
[SPEAKER_13]: But nothing is the original.

1377
01:52:57,784 --> 01:53:00,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing will piss you off and make you hit the machine.

1378
01:53:01,565 --> 01:53:04,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing will make you love a trackball and respect the trackball.

1379
01:53:05,106 --> 01:53:06,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, fuck yeah.

1380
01:53:06,507 --> 01:53:08,847
[SPEAKER_13]: This game is damn near impossible without a trackball.

1381
01:53:09,088 --> 01:53:10,288
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's just how it is.

1382
01:53:11,028 --> 01:53:12,209
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, Marble Madness.

1383
01:53:12,629 --> 01:53:15,230
[SPEAKER_13]: But you have to play the level 2 music for me because it's the best.

1384
01:53:15,270 --> 01:53:16,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just played it like five times.

1385
01:53:16,650 --> 01:53:17,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I was talking.

1386
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:19,071
[SPEAKER_04]: You had so much to say about the game.

1387
01:53:23,015 --> 01:53:24,975
[SPEAKER_13]: This is seriously like my favorite music.

1388
01:53:25,095 --> 01:53:25,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you happy now?

1389
01:53:26,336 --> 01:53:32,877
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you the other thing I really like about this is that it reminds me of Wendy, what's her name, that did the Tron music.

1390
01:53:33,277 --> 01:53:34,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1391
01:53:34,097 --> 01:53:36,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I've always loved that synth style.

1392
01:53:37,258 --> 01:53:37,738
[SPEAKER_05]: FM synth.

1393
01:53:38,578 --> 01:53:39,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1394
01:53:39,298 --> 01:53:40,339
[SPEAKER_13]: I love it so much.

1395
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:42,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't I remember her last name now?

1396
01:53:44,799 --> 01:53:47,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Wendy, does it start with an O?

1397
01:53:50,058 --> 01:54:12,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Wendy Carlos Wendy Carlos, okay It's C-O It's an arched letter It made me think a lot of Wendy Carlos' music Well, I mean, it came out two years after Tron So I could definitely see there being influence in the music And even that grid style If you notice the colors in some of the levels in that style I see some Tron influence, so

1398
01:54:13,146 --> 01:54:29,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Marble Madness, definitely a classic, and you can certainly find that in collections, like I think that Midway game I had on the PS3 for a little bit had that in it, but again, you know, thumbstick versus trackball, not the same, sorry to say.

1399
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:33,151
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another successor that she didn't mention.

1400
01:54:33,611 --> 01:54:45,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure I even called into OLR about this like five years ago because a buddy of mine had a copy of this and I've never played it since and I really want to called Kororinpa Marble Mania.

1401
01:54:46,193 --> 01:54:57,496
[SPEAKER_05]: We exclusive, you play the game, I think it was Mario Galaxy or Mario Galaxy 2 when your character jumps on like a big bowling ball and goes down a track.

1402
01:54:58,056 --> 01:55:04,964
[SPEAKER_05]: What the game tells you to do is take the Wiimote and put the bottom in the palm of your hand and treat it like an arcade stand of joystick kind of thing.

1403
01:55:05,585 --> 01:55:09,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Kororimpa uses that control method exactly.

1404
01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:11,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about Kororimpa.

1405
01:55:11,171 --> 01:55:12,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It's surprisingly fun.

1406
01:55:12,533 --> 01:55:14,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have that game.

1407
01:55:14,235 --> 01:55:17,078
[SPEAKER_04]: It is totally a Marble Madness biting, but it's great.

1408
01:55:17,598 --> 01:55:18,459
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

1409
01:55:35,815 --> 01:55:39,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, there's plenty more Orange Laundry to come.

1410
01:55:39,077 --> 01:55:41,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you all brought your sleeping bags because it's going all night tonight.

1411
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:49,763
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we will try to tear through the news in the second half quickly so we can get to your calls, your emails, the FUs of the week, FUBU Question of the Week, and so much more.

1412
01:55:49,803 --> 01:55:51,865
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back, plenty more Orange Laundry to come.

1413
01:55:52,265 --> 01:55:52,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.

1414
01:55:52,885 --> 01:55:53,806
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back right after this.

1415
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:12,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday night December the 1st of 2013 I cannot believe it is already December and we're almost to 2014 Episode number 529 of our show I cannot believe we have done 529 episodes of this show

1416
01:56:16,912 --> 01:56:17,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasian

1417
01:56:42,429 --> 01:56:43,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, Fantasia.

1418
01:56:43,090 --> 01:56:46,993
[SPEAKER_04]: You were saying something about where's that Xbox One game Fantasia that was supposed to be out?

1419
01:56:47,354 --> 01:56:49,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually wondering that exact same thing the other day.

1420
01:56:49,135 --> 01:56:50,637
[SPEAKER_04]: It got delayed to 2014.

1421
01:56:51,057 --> 01:56:53,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasia, the music evolved from Harmonix.

1422
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:55,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, when did that happen?

1423
01:56:55,561 --> 01:56:56,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of out of the blue, I guess.

1424
01:56:57,919 --> 01:57:01,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I haven't seen anything from Microsoft on that.

1425
01:57:01,862 --> 01:57:07,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, a lot of their first party titles... Well, I should say only one of their first party titles actually got delayed as well.

1426
01:57:07,566 --> 01:57:08,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

1427
01:57:08,847 --> 01:57:10,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was Kinect Sports.

1428
01:57:11,809 --> 01:57:12,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1429
01:57:12,589 --> 01:57:12,949
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1430
01:57:12,989 --> 01:57:14,611
[SPEAKER_04]: But weren't they doing like a demo thing?

1431
01:57:14,651 --> 01:57:15,831
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a demo thing going on right now.

1432
01:57:15,851 --> 01:57:18,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like what Nintendo did with the Wii Sports remake.

1433
01:57:18,553 --> 01:57:20,114
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's been delayed.

1434
01:57:20,274 --> 01:57:23,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was delayed just because there's a big gap in titles coming out.

1435
01:57:24,297 --> 01:57:25,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, you know...

1436
01:57:26,844 --> 01:57:37,717
[SPEAKER_03]: After this week, you know what, next week is a couple, is a Vita game and a PlayStation 3 title that's been delayed forever, Painkiller.

1437
01:57:37,817 --> 01:57:41,642
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, do what DarkSakura's doing, do one game a week to help get caught up on your backlog.

1438
01:57:41,922 --> 01:57:43,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, at least, you know, look at them.

1439
01:57:44,997 --> 01:57:46,138
[SPEAKER_04]: PrettyBox This Is It

1440
01:58:08,137 --> 01:58:12,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, in fact, I was just checking to see if they had them online, but it hasn't been updated yet.

1441
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:14,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Try Tuesday.

1442
01:58:15,281 --> 01:58:22,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's going to be some more stuff being added to PlayStation Plus for December, including Borderlands 2 and Grid 2.

1443
01:58:23,146 --> 01:58:24,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Those will be coming as well.

1444
01:58:26,989 --> 01:58:48,984
[SPEAKER_03]: and then on let's see here oh and Dyad is also going to be coming to play free as well I remember hearing about the game but I don't remember what it is exactly but it's supposed to be good and then I think that was the one that was supposed to be sort of like like Geometry Wars maybe

1445
01:58:51,899 --> 01:58:55,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to look it up real quick because it sounds familiar to me too.

1446
01:58:58,802 --> 01:59:01,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tunnel racing puzzle shooting game is what they call it.

1447
01:59:02,003 --> 01:59:03,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well then it's nothing like Geometry Wars.

1448
01:59:04,524 --> 01:59:05,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds cool though.

1449
01:59:05,485 --> 01:59:06,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that description.

1450
01:59:06,165 --> 01:59:06,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check that out.

1451
01:59:07,426 --> 01:59:15,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Then for Vita, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transform for the Vita and Urban Trial Freestyle.

1452
01:59:17,591 --> 01:59:18,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty awesome.

1453
01:59:18,531 --> 01:59:19,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's coming out.

1454
01:59:19,972 --> 01:59:29,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to be fair, I think on the Xbox front, I know Gears of War is going to be one of the free games.

1455
01:59:29,415 --> 01:59:34,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the Xbox Live Arcade title that's also with that, though.

1456
01:59:35,858 --> 01:59:38,659
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Gears of War 1 coming.

1457
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:41,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

1458
01:59:43,399 --> 02:00:10,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Saints Row 4 getting some DLC pretty soon actually I think next week or on the 11th and they're gonna have to save Santa Claus from the simulation so how the Saints save Christmas and it will come with of course as I predicted a Christmas themed dubstep gun and then a bunch of other you know things reindeer jingle bells jingle bells jingle bells

1459
02:00:12,248 --> 02:00:12,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

1460
02:00:13,409 --> 02:00:19,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's part of the Season Pass or $6.99 if you wait until December.

1461
02:00:20,332 --> 02:00:25,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have you know, though, if you do buy the Season Pass, I think right now it's on sale for 66% off.

1462
02:00:25,875 --> 02:00:33,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like $5 right now or, you know, on Steam, so it might be worth picking that up if you're curious, I guess.

1463
02:00:33,999 --> 02:00:35,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Jason, I got it.

1464
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:35,560
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?

1465
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:35,880
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?

1466
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:39,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Come, they told me, pum.

1467
02:00:39,842 --> 02:00:40,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Wub, wub, wub, pum.

1468
02:00:44,408 --> 02:00:44,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1469
02:00:44,788 --> 02:00:45,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You like that?

1470
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:45,770
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good.

1471
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:46,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put out an album.

1472
02:00:46,952 --> 02:00:47,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Swear to God.

1473
02:00:48,395 --> 02:00:48,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Wub wub wub.

1474
02:00:48,996 --> 02:00:49,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Wub wub wub.

1475
02:00:50,379 --> 02:00:50,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Wub wub wub.

1476
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:51,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

1477
02:00:56,767 --> 02:01:00,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some great news, and definitely coming very soon.

1478
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:06,794
[SPEAKER_03]: In December, we will see the final PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto game coming to mobile.

1479
02:01:07,495 --> 02:01:13,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas getting an improved, I believe, slightly HD version.

1480
02:01:14,379 --> 02:01:18,442
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be coming out not sure when, but sometime this month.

1481
02:01:19,163 --> 02:01:22,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposed to be on iOS and Android and Windows Mobile.

1482
02:01:23,226 --> 02:01:25,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, limited devices are going to be able to run that, but

1483
02:01:25,447 --> 02:01:26,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, man.

1484
02:01:26,207 --> 02:01:33,269
[SPEAKER_03]: San Andreas is like one of the best PlayStation 2 era Grand Theft Auto games and that's just all sorts of awesome.

1485
02:01:33,469 --> 02:01:42,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I hope that that means now that they have all these sort of HD-ified Grand Theft Auto games that we get some sort of triple pack for like Xbox Live Arcade or something like that.

1486
02:01:43,072 --> 02:01:44,052
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be amazing.

1487
02:01:45,373 --> 02:01:45,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1488
02:02:05,270 --> 02:02:06,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Hatsune Miku Project Diva Dingo

1489
02:02:30,066 --> 02:02:31,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1490
02:02:31,267 --> 02:02:42,051
[SPEAKER_04]: The game will take place after Persona 4, the Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold, and Tetsuya Komuro and Daisuke Asakura and some other musicians will be doing the background music for the game.

1491
02:02:42,431 --> 02:02:51,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the games in the game will include Pursuing My True Self, Heaven, Reach Out to the Truth, Time to Make History, and True Story, which were all songs that were in Persona 4 and Persona 4 Golden.

1492
02:02:52,334 --> 02:02:53,395
[SPEAKER_04]: So, awesome.

1493
02:02:53,415 --> 02:02:54,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the song list is starting to take shape.

1494
02:02:55,035 --> 02:02:55,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1495
02:02:56,676 --> 02:02:57,877
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1496
02:03:20,074 --> 02:03:22,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Where Shane Alinko is mind blown.

1497
02:03:23,676 --> 02:03:26,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Something gaming is happening in Wichita, go figure.

1498
02:03:26,417 --> 02:03:30,380
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Wichita game developer's name is Davis Sickman Jr.

1499
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:39,424
[SPEAKER_04]: He's raising some money with a Kickstarter to try to revive the Jumpman games for iPhone, iPad, Android, PC, Mac, and Ouya.

1500
02:03:40,905 --> 02:03:42,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

1501
02:03:42,186 --> 02:03:47,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Jumpman, of course, originally created by Randy Glover for the Atari and the old school PCs and Commodore 64.

1502
02:03:48,569 --> 02:03:54,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Jumpman Forever Nothing ever works out 2049 What if they did a crossover game that was Doodle Jumpman?

1503
02:04:16,839 --> 02:04:18,100
[SPEAKER_04]: There's potential, you never know.

1504
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:23,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you know there's a lot of potential in the awesome game Typing of the Dead Overkill.

1505
02:04:23,863 --> 02:04:25,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck yes, this game is a lot of fun.

1506
02:04:25,624 --> 02:04:31,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it again with, speaking of Shane in Wichita, played this online this past week.

1507
02:04:31,427 --> 02:04:36,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one thing we didn't get to do unfortunately was try the brand new DLC that was released this week.

1508
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: The Shakespeare DLC pack.

1509
02:04:39,291 --> 02:04:44,214
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, for $3 you can get all the typing in the game changed to lines as Shakespeare.

1510
02:04:44,614 --> 02:04:54,127
[SPEAKER_04]: To Thine O's Self, Quintessence of Dust, and Bellows Mender So you can actually type shit here Do we get the line about the bunghole from Hamlet?

1511
02:04:54,568 --> 02:04:57,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything is possible, DarkSakura You know what a bunghole is, right?

1512
02:04:58,853 --> 02:04:59,154
[SPEAKER_13]: For real

1513
02:05:00,111 --> 02:05:00,892
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1514
02:05:15,251 --> 02:05:15,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Dang it.

1515
02:05:16,012 --> 02:05:18,034
[SPEAKER_13]: I was actually looking at the email.

1516
02:05:19,335 --> 02:05:23,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there is a website now open for the Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary.

1517
02:05:24,359 --> 02:05:25,900
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can go look at it.

1518
02:05:26,021 --> 02:05:30,424
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure you can just hunt it down by looking up Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary site.

1519
02:05:30,785 --> 02:05:34,628
[SPEAKER_13]: But it has some teasing on there too.

1520
02:05:34,688 --> 02:05:35,329
[SPEAKER_13]: What could it be?

1521
02:05:35,669 --> 02:05:36,109
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't know.

1522
02:05:37,631 --> 02:05:38,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving forward...

1523
02:05:42,661 --> 02:05:49,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Atlas is basically free to look at any of Sega's old IPs, any of their dormant ones.

1524
02:05:50,527 --> 02:05:56,232
[SPEAKER_13]: So you know that could be Panzer Dragoon, that could be Jet Set Radio, that could be Shenmue.

1525
02:05:59,134 --> 02:05:59,895
[SPEAKER_13]: So who knows?

1526
02:06:00,495 --> 02:06:01,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Or it could just be Streets of Rage.

1527
02:06:02,197 --> 02:06:05,319
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, there's that silver lining I mentioned earlier about Shenmue.

1528
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:09,903
[SPEAKER_03]: They should make a spin-off game where the main character is a cow and they call it Shenmue.

1529
02:06:10,835 --> 02:06:12,077
[SPEAKER_13]: and more.

1530
02:06:13,258 --> 02:06:13,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1531
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:21,086
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and then, now this, I actually sat and watched freaking footage for almost two hours watching this thing today.

1532
02:06:21,887 --> 02:06:25,170
[SPEAKER_13]: And this one, I'm going to go ahead and just give the link to this.

1533
02:06:25,190 --> 02:06:26,532
[SPEAKER_13]: This is on shoryuken.com.

1534
02:06:28,794 --> 02:06:29,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultra Street Fighter 4...

1535
02:06:32,878 --> 02:06:35,540
[SPEAKER_13]: is at Super Arcade in Walnut, California.

1536
02:06:36,341 --> 02:06:39,724
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is basically location testing.

1537
02:06:41,005 --> 02:06:46,549
[SPEAKER_13]: But there is a two-hour just play of some of the different characters that are in it.

1538
02:06:46,589 --> 02:06:51,793
[SPEAKER_13]: We have T-Hawk, we have Rolento, we have Elena, Makoto, and Poison.

1539
02:06:52,513 --> 02:06:59,879
[SPEAKER_13]: I was actually very happily surprised at just how much more balanced some of the gameplay seems in it.

1540
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:04,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but you can, uh, watch, uh, the footage.

1541
02:07:04,363 --> 02:07:07,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, there's a link following from Shoryuken.com, so go look at it.

1542
02:07:10,308 --> 02:07:10,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1543
02:07:11,248 --> 02:07:11,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1544
02:07:12,089 --> 02:07:17,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of, uh, I would, I would think this would be a dead period for gaming news, but we still got a lot of good stuff going on out there.

1545
02:07:18,234 --> 02:07:21,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1546
02:07:21,077 --> 02:07:21,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1547
02:07:28,764 --> 02:07:32,729
[SPEAKER_04]: You take Facebook and you take Google+, and you slam those words together, you get FOOGLE!

1548
02:07:32,869 --> 02:07:43,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's our FOOGLE question of the week, posted on both our communities, over at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and our Google Plus community at Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1549
02:07:43,981 --> 02:07:46,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you know what, if you put Orange Lounge Radio on Google, you'll find it.

1550
02:07:47,064 --> 02:07:47,525
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes right up.

1551
02:07:47,945 --> 02:07:48,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, um...

1552
02:07:50,147 --> 02:08:07,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only going to be able to read a couple I'm trying to buy us back some time since our interview went long but with great reason it was a great interview but I'm going to try to buy back some time here so I'm not going to read a lot of answers but I really want to encourage you to read because there were some great answers to this so here it is earlier this week one popular web blog for Apple fans made the claim

1553
02:08:08,903 --> 02:08:18,847
[SPEAKER_04]: While the previous game console generation was all about motion controls, it's clear that the new machines will use second screen functionality and apps as major weapons of war.

1554
02:08:24,549 --> 02:08:29,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that all the AAA players are on the field, what do you feel was the majority theme of the last generation?

1555
02:08:29,971 --> 02:08:31,772
[SPEAKER_04]: What might the theme of the next generation be?

1556
02:08:32,092 --> 02:08:36,974
[SPEAKER_04]: More motion, second screens, VR, AR, more 3D, and so on.

1557
02:08:37,194 --> 02:08:42,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And a fact you guys may not have known, this question today coming from Jason actually invented this question.

1558
02:08:42,336 --> 02:08:44,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, do you want to elaborate on this at all before I read some of the answers?

1559
02:08:45,057 --> 02:08:46,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just...

1560
02:08:47,019 --> 02:08:52,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing terribly to elaborate on, I just don't think that second screen is going to wind up making any sort of significant dent.

1561
02:08:52,806 --> 02:09:02,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the apps are getting better and they're going to exist, but as far as that being this year's motion, that's not going to be nearly all it's cracked up to be.

1562
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:03,639
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1563
02:09:03,879 --> 02:09:05,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's look at some of the answers again.

1564
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:06,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I've really got to abbreviate this tonight.

1565
02:09:06,781 --> 02:09:17,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, please, please go read the responses in full because there's some great ones, including this one on Google Plus from Colin M who says, Last gen felt like the Me Too generation.

1566
02:09:17,968 --> 02:09:21,731
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii introduced motion controls and Sony was like, Me Too with the six axis.

1567
02:09:22,111 --> 02:09:24,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft at least tried something new with the Kinect.

1568
02:09:24,652 --> 02:09:28,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I just got to say, I really like that answer.

1569
02:09:28,815 --> 02:09:34,337
[SPEAKER_04]: because, I mean, for real, because, I mean, I'm not having to read the second half yet, but I was like, you know what?

1570
02:09:34,697 --> 02:09:35,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, if that ain't right.

1571
02:09:35,957 --> 02:09:40,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It does feel like everybody was kind of stealing the good ideas from each other.

1572
02:09:40,259 --> 02:09:43,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, that's just competition, but you, like...

1573
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:54,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't go back to even the PlayStation 1 and Sega's Saturn era and talk about that was a Me Too generation.

1574
02:09:54,624 --> 02:09:55,245
[SPEAKER_04]: It really wasn't.

1575
02:09:55,365 --> 02:09:55,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Optical media.

1576
02:09:56,265 --> 02:10:01,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but that's... Ooh, a new format which is leagues above and better of all the cartridges ever.

1577
02:10:01,447 --> 02:10:11,872
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not Me Too in the way that that E3 a couple years ago when they debuted the Kinect and the Sony move, you were sitting there going, wow, they're just after Nintendo's weave, aren't they?

1578
02:10:12,612 --> 02:10:14,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's very interesting.

1579
02:10:14,313 --> 02:10:16,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let me read the rest of Colin's answer here on Google+.

1580
02:10:17,015 --> 02:10:20,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the defining feature of this new gen will be social interaction.

1581
02:10:20,737 --> 02:10:26,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have activity feeds a la Facebook to show you what your friends are doing.

1582
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:28,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the Wii U has that plaza of sorts.

1583
02:10:28,942 --> 02:10:31,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they're sharing videos of the games and live streaming.

1584
02:10:31,523 --> 02:10:36,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Seamless multiplayer experiences such as Watch Dogs will blur the line between single player and multiplayer gaming.

1585
02:10:37,186 --> 02:10:39,748
[SPEAKER_04]: This next gen will be all about other people.

1586
02:10:40,228 --> 02:10:41,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, you made a motion.

1587
02:10:41,789 --> 02:10:42,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1588
02:10:42,289 --> 02:10:42,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

1589
02:10:42,889 --> 02:10:59,558
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what my prediction for this generation is going to be, is that last year was better graphics, denser media, mostly, and motion controls, yes, and except in the case of Wii, mostly, cementing the online marketplace and online interactivity.

1590
02:11:00,398 --> 02:11:18,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a very strong feeling that this generation, also in PC land, is going to be not just developing a title, updating it, and moving on, but it's going to be more socially geared with your friends, but also gaming communities.

1591
02:11:19,088 --> 02:11:22,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how much new Borderlands 2 content there is?

1592
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:26,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how much new Diablo content there is?

1593
02:11:27,713 --> 02:11:34,037
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these games are geared with the capability of tacking new content on continuously.

1594
02:11:34,498 --> 02:11:37,640
[SPEAKER_05]: In my opinion, microtransactions be damned.

1595
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:45,529
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D makes my head hurt, motion control frustrates me, it makes me break a sweat, and I'm almost positive VR would make me throw up.

1596
02:11:45,569 --> 02:11:46,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's stick to buttons.

1597
02:11:56,341 --> 02:12:17,240
[SPEAKER_04]: gripping and movie quality storylines and gameplay that pushes the limits of what we have already seen or felt so far as for second screen bring it on I love how well the Vita and PS3 play together can't wait to get my PS4 love my Wii U and the new PlayStation app they added is a great step in the right direction for Sony so instead of mobiles attempt to take over consoles let's make a baby and all get along

1598
02:12:18,757 --> 02:12:20,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is Travis' prediction.

1599
02:12:20,379 --> 02:12:21,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make a baby.

1600
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:22,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll get along.

1601
02:12:23,482 --> 02:12:23,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

1602
02:12:24,403 --> 02:12:27,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Those answers from Google+, but there's about six other answers there if you want to check that out.

1603
02:12:27,686 --> 02:12:29,328
[SPEAKER_05]: We can call it the X4U.

1604
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:33,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to Facebook.

1605
02:12:34,414 --> 02:12:35,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's read some answers here on Facebook.

1606
02:12:35,815 --> 02:12:39,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I might be being partial here, but I really like this answer from Extafirm.

1607
02:12:39,979 --> 02:12:40,780
[SPEAKER_04]: our buddy from Horde House.

1608
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:43,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Extrover over on Facebook says, Let's make a baby, right?

1609
02:13:04,441 --> 02:13:10,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's read another answer here from Ricardo V who says, I don't think the last generation was about motion controls.

1610
02:13:11,224 --> 02:13:14,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the marketing makes it look that way because it was the new thing.

1611
02:13:14,485 --> 02:13:17,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end, I think it was more about giving a cinematic feel to games.

1612
02:13:18,367 --> 02:13:22,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of scripted events, animations of characters with the environment as you played, etc.

1613
02:13:22,549 --> 02:13:27,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Clear examples of that are games like Uncharted, The Last of Us, and Bioshock Infinite.

1614
02:13:27,911 --> 02:13:38,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I still don't have a new console but I think we started seeing what the new gen is about in the previous gen integration of indie games into the consoles multitasking and cloud and digital content

1615
02:13:39,867 --> 02:13:40,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

1616
02:13:40,407 --> 02:13:41,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that too.

1617
02:13:41,508 --> 02:13:55,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly, even though I think you saw it a little bit with PlayStation 2, just that when you talk about cinematic feel, certainly the budgets are starting to get up there where it's like you're making three movies when you make a video game just with what goes into it.

1618
02:13:55,958 --> 02:13:59,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So I definitely think that took off, especially those games you cited there.

1619
02:14:00,561 --> 02:14:03,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do one more answer from Facebook.

1620
02:14:03,242 --> 02:14:05,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do this one from Andy R who said,

1621
02:14:22,148 --> 02:14:25,570
[SPEAKER_04]: We're playing the game online could change or enhance the gameplay experience.

1622
02:14:26,090 --> 02:14:30,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with games like Watch Dogs or Destiny, the theme seems to be continuing.

1623
02:14:47,583 --> 02:14:53,950
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get back into some long-form news, but if you have more thoughts on this topic, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is a great place to send it to.

1624
02:14:54,410 --> 02:14:54,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1625
02:14:55,711 --> 02:15:05,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say also, yeah, I definitely don't think motion control is... I think the problem with motion control, and this is even going to be something going into next year with Kinect and stuff, is just... It's a gimmick.

1626
02:15:06,142 --> 02:15:08,745
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, remember when they had the vision camera?

1627
02:15:09,085 --> 02:15:09,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1628
02:15:10,967 --> 02:15:16,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a gimmick that sold more copies of Wii Sports than any other video game in history.

1629
02:15:16,572 --> 02:15:18,173
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not saying that we did it wrong.

1630
02:15:18,454 --> 02:15:21,557
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the right idea because their whole console is based on that in the beginning.

1631
02:15:22,157 --> 02:15:24,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that was fine and that worked.

1632
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:28,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

1633
02:15:29,444 --> 02:15:29,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It did not work.

1634
02:15:30,024 --> 02:15:30,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a fad.

1635
02:15:30,745 --> 02:15:34,408
[SPEAKER_03]: And I honestly think... Did you just make a pro Nintendo statement versus the other two?

1636
02:15:34,428 --> 02:15:34,469
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1637
02:15:35,169 --> 02:15:35,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always said that.

1638
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:37,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

1639
02:15:37,730 --> 02:15:38,170
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just funny.

1640
02:15:55,917 --> 02:15:59,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think it's something that we're going to see implemented well into games.

1641
02:15:59,678 --> 02:16:04,339
[SPEAKER_03]: You may get a couple games that implement it well, but aside from that, just look what they've done with Kinect.

1642
02:16:04,459 --> 02:16:06,260
[SPEAKER_03]: It's voice commands for shit.

1643
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:11,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's FIFA detecting that you're cursing so they can flag you.

1644
02:16:11,201 --> 02:16:12,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the fuck would you want that?

1645
02:16:13,021 --> 02:16:14,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know why anyone would want that.

1646
02:16:14,602 --> 02:16:15,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1647
02:16:16,212 --> 02:16:23,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, okay, so let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One since I mentioned Kinect.

1648
02:16:24,581 --> 02:16:34,972
[SPEAKER_03]: You may remember last week we talked a little bit about how the Xbox One had some issues with some of the consoles that, hey, there was disk drive sounding like it was shredding the disk.

1649
02:16:35,893 --> 02:16:37,075
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's what it sounded like.

1650
02:16:37,815 --> 02:16:45,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was an issue and I said, you know, they really should come out and address the issue and figure out a way to appease customers and stuff like that.

1651
02:16:45,261 --> 02:16:45,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what they did.

1652
02:16:45,962 --> 02:16:49,465
[SPEAKER_03]: They went ahead and said, you know what, they're going to replace the console.

1653
02:16:49,525 --> 02:16:55,069
[SPEAKER_03]: What's kind of great about it is if you call in and say, hey, you know, my console's all fucked up.

1654
02:16:55,670 --> 02:16:59,072
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're going to do is give you a free digital version of one of the Xbox One launch titles.

1655
02:16:59,092 --> 02:17:03,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So either Forza, Rise of the Rome, Dead Rising 3, or Zoo Tycoon.

1656
02:17:04,637 --> 02:17:04,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1657
02:17:05,297 --> 02:17:10,964
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get to keep your console until the replacement console arrives and you send the replacement console back.

1658
02:17:11,845 --> 02:17:25,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought that's a pretty decent way to make up for those drive issues and I haven't heard too much more about it this week so I'm assuming that it was indeed a very small number of consoles that were affected by it.

1659
02:17:26,441 --> 02:17:28,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank God that it's not so widespread.

1660
02:17:29,444 --> 02:17:31,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they learned their lesson the last time.

1661
02:17:32,587 --> 02:17:34,568
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not want to make that mistake again.

1662
02:17:35,589 --> 02:17:36,010
[SPEAKER_04]: No kidding.

1663
02:17:36,770 --> 02:17:38,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this could get very interesting.

1664
02:17:38,872 --> 02:17:42,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Could EA be working on an open world Star Wars game?

1665
02:17:42,715 --> 02:17:51,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Some recent job listings apparently point to this, which of course makes me raise an eyebrow and go, but I thought they already had a Star Wars MMO called The Old Republic.

1666
02:17:51,923 --> 02:18:06,812
[SPEAKER_04]: but perhaps something new to tie in with the new games or maybe not even necessarily an MMO but an animation director being hired for EA Canada for quote a major new next gen open world action game in a beloved sci-fi property.

1667
02:18:07,252 --> 02:18:08,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like Battlefront to me.

1668
02:18:08,894 --> 02:18:09,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe?

1669
02:18:09,634 --> 02:18:10,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1670
02:18:10,715 --> 02:18:20,040
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also an executive producer position and a lead combat designer position, which apparently was also linked to a Star Wars property because a recruiter said something on Twitter.

1671
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:20,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1672
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:31,845
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, apparently this goes back to when Avalanche Studios was working with LucasArts, or almost signed up with LucasArts to do an open world Star Wars game around 2007.

1673
02:18:31,885 --> 02:18:31,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1674
02:18:33,306 --> 02:18:35,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that would have been so amazing.

1675
02:18:35,308 --> 02:18:37,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you guys remember Star Wars 1313?

1676
02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:43,555
[SPEAKER_04]: That was something that was supposed to be... Disney Candid, if you didn't know, Disney closed developer, that halted the game.

1677
02:18:43,656 --> 02:18:46,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Could that be the game that's being picked up and continued?

1678
02:18:46,678 --> 02:18:47,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Question mark.

1679
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:47,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1680
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:51,903
[SPEAKER_04]: EA, of course, has the exclusive rights to develop and continue the Star Wars games.

1681
02:18:52,203 --> 02:18:52,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1682
02:18:53,544 --> 02:18:58,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Something will happen by December 2015 when the new Star Wars movie comes out.

1683
02:18:58,549 --> 02:18:59,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Guaranteed.

1684
02:18:59,429 --> 02:19:03,813
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Avalanche is the company behind Just Cause, which makes it very exciting.

1685
02:19:03,993 --> 02:19:07,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also have the new Mad Max game coming out, so that could be very awesome.

1686
02:19:08,077 --> 02:19:09,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked the trailer for that.

1687
02:19:10,322 --> 02:19:30,610
[SPEAKER_04]: They know how to make a good multiplayer game Or new open world game So it's December 2013 now So you got two years to make it happen Sounds like they already got started So we'll see what happens Don't make me feel older Just think about how old we're gonna be When the new Star Wars movie finally comes out Or the Warcraft movie Do you know what is next year?

1688
02:19:31,230 --> 02:19:35,372
[SPEAKER_04]: My 20th high school reunion Oh my gosh, wow Are you gonna go?

1689
02:19:36,293 --> 02:19:39,774
[SPEAKER_13]: If someone gives me $400 for the plane ticket, yeah I'm gonna try to

1690
02:19:41,186 --> 02:19:45,588
[SPEAKER_04]: My 10-year reunion was practically just downtown where I go all the time.

1691
02:19:45,788 --> 02:19:46,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't go.

1692
02:19:46,548 --> 02:19:48,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, you're not from another state, rad.

1693
02:19:48,909 --> 02:19:49,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, but I'm just saying.

1694
02:19:51,290 --> 02:19:53,190
[SPEAKER_04]: My 10-year reunion was crap.

1695
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:54,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we had one for mine.

1696
02:19:54,591 --> 02:19:55,371
[SPEAKER_13]: If we did, I didn't care.

1697
02:19:55,551 --> 02:19:58,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people I want to keep in touch with, I still talk to on Facebook.

1698
02:19:58,772 --> 02:19:59,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It was garbage.

1699
02:19:59,573 --> 02:20:02,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I actually keep up with some of those people now on Facebook.

1700
02:20:02,974 --> 02:20:04,254
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, you have kids.

1701
02:20:04,675 --> 02:20:05,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a cat.

1702
02:20:06,515 --> 02:20:07,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my cat.

1703
02:20:08,377 --> 02:20:10,218
[SPEAKER_04]: High school was such a bad time.

1704
02:20:10,458 --> 02:20:11,739
[SPEAKER_04]: In some ways it was good, in some ways it was bad.

1705
02:20:11,779 --> 02:20:14,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make it sound like poor me because we all had bad experiences, I'm sure.

1706
02:20:15,662 --> 02:20:21,607
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's just some people from high school I would really love to go my entire life and just never see again.

1707
02:20:21,647 --> 02:20:24,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be very happy with that.

1708
02:20:24,514 --> 02:20:25,656
[SPEAKER_13]: I can sympathize with that.

1709
02:20:25,696 --> 02:20:28,780
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to bring Dan and have Dan.

1710
02:20:30,062 --> 02:20:33,968
[SPEAKER_13]: And then like leave early like I did for Homecoming my senior year.

1711
02:20:33,988 --> 02:20:36,071
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, bye.

1712
02:20:36,111 --> 02:20:36,812
[SPEAKER_13]: This place sucks.

1713
02:20:37,073 --> 02:20:38,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, don't I have a story to do?

1714
02:20:38,094 --> 02:20:38,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you do.

1715
02:20:39,502 --> 02:20:42,265
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1716
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:04,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, what he said is that, and this is a quote, I've been at Blizzard Entertainment for almost six years.

1717
02:21:04,904 --> 02:21:11,549
[SPEAKER_13]: It has been epic, and I have made many friends around the world, and I've learned so much, but I have a great opportunity for something new and exciting.

1718
02:21:11,989 --> 02:21:13,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Sadly, it is time to move on.

1719
02:21:13,951 --> 02:21:15,412
[SPEAKER_13]: He's also going to Oculus...

1720
02:21:16,733 --> 02:21:17,913
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we don't know.

1721
02:21:18,153 --> 02:21:19,174
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of tinfoil.

1722
02:21:19,334 --> 02:21:23,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, being on Horde House, I talk to a lot of Warcraft people.

1723
02:21:23,655 --> 02:21:30,136
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some tinfoil hats in the community that he possibly went to Riot Games, maker of League of Legends, also in LA.

1724
02:21:30,456 --> 02:21:35,537
[SPEAKER_04]: This is based on a total conspiracy theory about who he follows on Twitter, which is interesting.

1725
02:21:36,438 --> 02:21:41,679
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, if he quit Warcraft to go to League of Legends, he'd just be like everybody else.

1726
02:21:42,299 --> 02:21:51,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah But I'm bummed Which is strange considering that Blizzard's new one is coming out Yeah, but the funny part is that it's not funny I know, alright Well, you know what?

1727
02:21:51,863 --> 02:22:05,668
[SPEAKER_04]: People go and, you know, people moving from company to company usually isn't news But the thing about World of Warcraft, man Quasi-related question to that comment Do those conspiracy theories come from people in California or outside of California?

1728
02:22:06,559 --> 02:22:07,059
[SPEAKER_04]: All over.

1729
02:22:07,139 --> 02:22:08,380
[SPEAKER_04]: They come from the internet.

1730
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:25,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a meaningful question to me because my coworkers, those that have lived in the Bay Area, you know, the better part of their lives, have a lot of friends at a lot of companies, either personally or professionally, including our competitors and everything else.

1731
02:22:26,067 --> 02:22:28,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, yeah.

1732
02:22:29,148 --> 02:22:30,309
[SPEAKER_05]: GitHub has competitors?

1733
02:22:30,369 --> 02:22:31,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.

1734
02:22:31,069 --> 02:22:32,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of thought they did their own thing.

1735
02:22:33,310 --> 02:22:33,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Very much no.

1736
02:22:34,972 --> 02:22:38,254
[SPEAKER_05]: The detail is, the depth is infinite.

1737
02:22:39,315 --> 02:22:43,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, everybody has the this is better, this is worse, has the confrontational aspect of it.

1738
02:22:44,058 --> 02:22:46,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure, that exists at a professional level as well.

1739
02:22:46,761 --> 02:22:52,065
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not, maybe I shouldn't rip back the veil, but it's not like...

1740
02:22:52,945 --> 02:22:56,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Death threats and at odds ends with each other.

1741
02:22:56,950 --> 02:23:05,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we just had a charity dodgeball game where our best friends at competing companies came out for a good cause as well.

1742
02:23:06,322 --> 02:23:09,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever we throw drink-ups, people from all of these companies come out.

1743
02:23:09,386 --> 02:23:09,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not...

1744
02:23:11,068 --> 02:23:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, professionally, it's competition, but that's healthy.

1745
02:23:15,851 --> 02:23:18,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people that make it up are good people.

1746
02:23:19,173 --> 02:23:26,618
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for the short time that I interned at a local TV news station, because I was going to be just like Ron Burgundy one day, and here I am.

1747
02:23:27,499 --> 02:23:37,385
[SPEAKER_04]: But I interned at a local TV station, and they would, about once every three months, there would be a big get-together of all the local news people from all, like NBC, CBS, all of them would just go have dinner.

1748
02:23:37,405 --> 02:23:40,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like they all hated each other.

1749
02:23:40,347 --> 02:23:48,896
[SPEAKER_04]: because a lot of times, and especially look at your own local TV news, they trade people all the time and people go to jobs at other companies and it just, you know, something happens.

1750
02:23:49,167 --> 02:23:51,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is industry.

1751
02:23:51,748 --> 02:23:58,612
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why there's conventions, professional conventions, where all of these same people talk, discuss, and meet all the rest of these people.

1752
02:23:59,413 --> 02:24:05,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also why you don't truly have companies that just bicker back and forth in the same industry and are just at odds ends with people.

1753
02:24:05,956 --> 02:24:07,557
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

1754
02:24:07,797 --> 02:24:10,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting insight for me to have now as well.

1755
02:24:11,619 --> 02:24:12,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more stories, Loki.

1756
02:24:40,362 --> 02:24:47,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so there was a report that was done showing all the different games he played and stuff.

1757
02:24:47,987 --> 02:24:57,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, even though with that profile and everything, it just didn't tie with the games at all.

1758
02:24:57,734 --> 02:25:01,758
[SPEAKER_03]: He played video games often both solo, home, and online.

1759
02:25:02,119 --> 02:25:04,802
[SPEAKER_03]: They can be described as both violent and non-violent.

1760
02:25:05,382 --> 02:25:14,912
[SPEAKER_03]: One person described the shooter as spending the majority of his time playing non-violent video games all day, with one of his favorites at one point being Super Mario Bros.

1761
02:25:14,932 --> 02:25:15,913
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, Super Mario Bros.

1762
02:25:15,953 --> 02:25:17,055
[SPEAKER_03]: causes mass murder.

1763
02:25:18,196 --> 02:25:22,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was a... I'll let you finish because I'm about to drag a bit.

1764
02:25:23,139 --> 02:25:25,441
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the shadow people that live on top of the cliff in the galaxy.

1765
02:25:25,461 --> 02:25:26,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to drag a bit.

1766
02:25:26,562 --> 02:25:42,234
[SPEAKER_03]: In conclusion, what we do know is the shooter had significant mental health issues while not affecting the criminality of the shooter's mental state for their crimes or his criminal responsibility for them did affect his ability to live a normal life and interact with others.

1767
02:25:42,954 --> 02:26:08,424
[SPEAKER_03]: whom we should have been close with and um you know video games did not play a part in that so um yeah and it's funny as even though after that came out of course the NRA issued a statement blaming still um or actually no I'm sorry that this is referring back to the um the original thing where the NRA blamed it of course no traction on that um

1768
02:26:10,499 --> 02:26:13,052
[SPEAKER_03]: No Retraction from the NRA about being wrong or anything

1769
02:26:15,047 --> 02:26:43,876
[SPEAKER_04]: as they usually are I was looking at Twitter this week as I usually do during the day and I saw a link and I made the mistake of clicking on it even though I saw the name Kotaku in the URL and my eyes rolled so far to the back of my head I could see my fucking brain because they ran a story about how the Sandy Hook shooter his favorite game was Dance Dance Revolution and this guy played DDR all the time and da da da da da and all I could really think of I was just like Kotaku please shut the fuck up

1770
02:26:44,756 --> 02:26:47,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please shut up.

1771
02:26:48,218 --> 02:26:48,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw these links.

1772
02:26:48,999 --> 02:26:49,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't read the article.

1773
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:53,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Surely they were making it tongue-in-cheek and making the same point that we are.

1774
02:26:53,182 --> 02:26:59,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I'm just sitting here going, why are you perpetuating this whole – I mean it's kind of irresponsible.

1775
02:26:59,806 --> 02:27:01,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clearly clickbait.

1776
02:27:01,527 --> 02:27:14,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clearly this whole – and I'm not even saying this because I played DDR for years and years because unlike what you do when you run a story like this, I don't give this shit any credit at all.

1777
02:27:15,036 --> 02:27:15,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Mental health

1778
02:27:39,380 --> 02:27:39,920
[SPEAKER_13]: There's that too.

1779
02:27:40,621 --> 02:27:41,521
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's speculation.

1780
02:27:42,541 --> 02:27:45,743
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I mean, it's just like... But with the state of... I hate to go into the politics of it.

1781
02:27:45,883 --> 02:27:46,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1782
02:27:46,583 --> 02:27:49,464
[SPEAKER_13]: But we don't give enough attention to mental health.

1783
02:27:50,965 --> 02:27:52,026
[SPEAKER_13]: And background checks.

1784
02:27:52,086 --> 02:27:53,826
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely a lot of stigma with that.

1785
02:27:54,287 --> 02:27:56,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to break down those walls a lot.

1786
02:27:56,688 --> 02:28:02,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would agree with you there that, you know, clearly he had issues that weren't being addressed.

1787
02:28:02,930 --> 02:28:03,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1788
02:28:03,270 --> 02:28:06,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Trying to beat those nine-footers might frustrate someone into... No, I'm serious.

1789
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:12,694
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so anyway, I'm just saying the ban on that website continues.

1790
02:28:12,894 --> 02:28:18,737
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, shame on me for being dumb enough to click a link like that.

1791
02:28:18,757 --> 02:28:20,997
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was just like, no, no, they could.

1792
02:28:21,178 --> 02:28:22,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1793
02:28:22,685 --> 02:28:24,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Every so often you have to confirm that yes, they're stupid.

1794
02:28:25,126 --> 02:28:31,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just kind of one of those like, Lord, get a... Anyhow, let's see.

1795
02:28:31,350 --> 02:28:37,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com SSJ100Matt says, basically this report answered no questions.

1796
02:28:40,074 --> 02:28:40,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1797
02:28:40,555 --> 02:28:43,376
[SPEAKER_04]: The Peggle Pervert.

1798
02:28:43,816 --> 02:28:46,318
[SPEAKER_04]: The Peggle Pervert says, see how I chat.

1799
02:28:47,278 --> 02:28:47,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Lord.

1800
02:28:47,799 --> 02:28:48,179
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1801
02:28:49,279 --> 02:28:49,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

1802
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:51,060
[SPEAKER_04]: More stories.

1803
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:52,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will go next.

1804
02:28:52,261 --> 02:28:52,942
[SPEAKER_13]: D&D Devil Worshippers

1805
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:15,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you are not worshipping the devil, are you, Rob?

1806
02:29:15,503 --> 02:29:16,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're doing?

1807
02:29:16,344 --> 02:29:17,424
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they said on Oprah, Rob.

1808
02:29:17,464 --> 02:29:18,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I love your mom.

1809
02:29:18,665 --> 02:29:21,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, don't play Dungeons and Dragons.

1810
02:29:22,068 --> 02:29:22,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1811
02:29:23,929 --> 02:29:24,570
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was like.

1812
02:29:25,090 --> 02:29:28,032
[SPEAKER_13]: They said on the 700 Club that that game leads to devil.

1813
02:29:28,052 --> 02:29:31,575
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents didn't even watch that shit, so I don't even know how they got on board.

1814
02:29:32,415 --> 02:29:34,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Or when they started caring if I worshipped Satan or not.

1815
02:29:34,236 --> 02:29:37,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you hear that the guy that started the Trinity Broadcasting Network died?

1816
02:29:37,899 --> 02:29:38,380
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't.

1817
02:29:38,661 --> 02:29:40,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he died yesterday.

1818
02:29:41,005 --> 02:29:42,607
[SPEAKER_13]: That Fast and Furious dude, too.

1819
02:29:43,248 --> 02:29:46,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, all I heard about on Facebook was the guy from Fast and the Furious.

1820
02:29:46,694 --> 02:29:48,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but that guy died, too, and no one cared.

1821
02:29:48,878 --> 02:29:49,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because...

1822
02:29:51,505 --> 02:29:54,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even going to finish my thought or I'm going to be a bad person.

1823
02:29:54,988 --> 02:29:58,451
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to bite my tongue and talk about the PlayStation 4.

1824
02:30:00,532 --> 02:30:01,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1825
02:30:01,733 --> 02:30:03,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing about the PlayStation 4.

1826
02:30:03,254 --> 02:30:04,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It may not last long.

1827
02:30:04,776 --> 02:30:05,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

1828
02:30:05,496 --> 02:30:06,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trolling.

1829
02:30:06,437 --> 02:30:06,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

1830
02:30:07,698 --> 02:30:08,358
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a comment.

1831
02:30:09,379 --> 02:30:35,312
[SPEAKER_04]: From Sony UK boss Fergal Gara Because of course the PlayStation just launched in the UK this week So there's a lot of stuff in the media over there this week And Fergal Gara made a very interesting comment saying I think there's reasons to believe that the next cycle might be shorter in markets such as the UK It's probably a sign of the times and how much has changed in seven years But I think the willingness and the appetite to pick up new technology fast has probably changed quite a bit

1832
02:30:35,672 --> 02:30:39,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So all this coming down to, will the PS4 be a 10 year life cycle?

1833
02:30:39,175 --> 02:30:39,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not.

1834
02:30:39,935 --> 02:30:40,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Horseshit.

1835
02:30:42,457 --> 02:30:42,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

1836
02:30:43,298 --> 02:30:45,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is going back to the question of the week.

1837
02:30:46,421 --> 02:30:48,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a question I've had in my mind for a very long time.

1838
02:30:49,123 --> 02:30:55,488
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as a new console, a new technology, and an overhaul, what the hell else are they going to do?

1839
02:30:57,129 --> 02:31:12,910
[SPEAKER_05]: The visual aspect and quality of video games has improved dramatically, and considering that unless everybody box on 4K and rolls that into a new technology, there's no visual dramatic changes that they can make in the next five years.

1840
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:21,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, I want to say yes, but when I was 12 years old and saw Super Nintendo Mode 7 for the first time, I was like, it's so fucking real.

1841
02:31:21,380 --> 02:31:23,082
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll never get more real than that.

1842
02:31:23,543 --> 02:31:24,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1843
02:31:24,424 --> 02:31:25,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So cool.

1844
02:31:25,605 --> 02:31:28,248
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is a terrible comparison.

1845
02:31:28,268 --> 02:31:28,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1846
02:31:29,743 --> 02:31:32,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you too!

1847
02:31:32,284 --> 02:31:35,684
[SPEAKER_05]: The quality standard is cinema slash real life.

1848
02:31:36,605 --> 02:31:38,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one step closer to the holodeck, Jason.

1849
02:31:38,725 --> 02:31:39,825
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we always say on the show.

1850
02:31:39,965 --> 02:31:42,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Every console is one step closer to the holodeck.

1851
02:31:42,206 --> 02:31:43,886
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would be a different technology.

1852
02:31:43,926 --> 02:31:46,667
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not just a graphical improvement, which is what I'm claiming right now.

1853
02:31:46,947 --> 02:31:54,649
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's nothing that can take that mantle in the next generation to make the PS4's lifecycle be less than four or five years.

1854
02:31:54,669 --> 02:31:56,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft Lightroom, Jason.

1855
02:31:56,869 --> 02:32:00,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to holodeck your walls.

1856
02:32:01,451 --> 02:32:09,815
[SPEAKER_13]: The difference would be moving from a... I don't really think you can use the holodeck as a graphical comparison.

1857
02:32:10,476 --> 02:32:11,116
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what I'm saying.

1858
02:32:11,316 --> 02:32:12,257
[SPEAKER_04]: One step closer, Jamie.

1859
02:32:12,317 --> 02:32:14,238
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to be at the holodeck the next generation.

1860
02:32:14,258 --> 02:32:16,038
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be awesome if we were.

1861
02:32:17,039 --> 02:32:19,900
[SPEAKER_13]: A more apt comparison would be... Shut up.

1862
02:32:21,741 --> 02:32:25,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Would be leaving your monitor for a holographic interface.

1863
02:32:27,199 --> 02:32:28,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what they have in the Hunger Games.

1864
02:32:32,141 --> 02:32:33,562
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the correct reaction.

1865
02:32:34,722 --> 02:32:36,603
[SPEAKER_03]: The end game can only be one thing.

1866
02:32:36,623 --> 02:32:37,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I didn't break the mic.

1867
02:32:38,324 --> 02:32:41,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, the end game can only be one thing.

1868
02:32:41,785 --> 02:32:45,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where the boobies become real and you can put your penis in it.

1869
02:32:45,347 --> 02:32:48,948
[SPEAKER_03]: That is really the end game that anyone can expect.

1870
02:32:49,028 --> 02:32:51,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Because where do you need to go beyond that?

1871
02:32:51,449 --> 02:32:52,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowhere.

1872
02:32:52,250 --> 02:32:52,890
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to go anywhere.

1873
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:54,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Not everybody is interested in that.

1874
02:32:54,551 --> 02:32:54,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1875
02:32:56,027 --> 02:32:58,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but that's going to be the end game.

1876
02:32:59,270 --> 02:33:00,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I want fluffy kitties.

1877
02:33:01,311 --> 02:33:03,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to be able to pet the kitties in the game.

1878
02:33:03,653 --> 02:33:05,394
[SPEAKER_03]: As do I, but I'm just saying.

1879
02:33:05,434 --> 02:33:06,235
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a switch.

1880
02:33:06,255 --> 02:33:07,076
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be pussy.

1881
02:33:08,637 --> 02:33:11,959
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a switch, just like on the old Atari 2600 game select.

1882
02:33:12,019 --> 02:33:13,641
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be boobie and kitty.

1883
02:33:13,961 --> 02:33:14,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, you know, no pants.

1884
02:33:15,362 --> 02:33:15,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And ferret mode.

1885
02:33:18,757 --> 02:33:19,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1886
02:33:21,118 --> 02:33:21,458
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1887
02:33:22,359 --> 02:33:25,720
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, one step closer to the edge and it's about to break.

1888
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:27,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like this show.

1889
02:33:28,482 --> 02:33:31,463
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been one step to the edge since episode three, okay?

1890
02:33:31,603 --> 02:33:32,504
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wasn't even here.

1891
02:33:33,964 --> 02:33:34,765
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.

1892
02:33:35,005 --> 02:33:36,145
[SPEAKER_13]: I was sleeping in a closet.

1893
02:33:36,225 --> 02:33:37,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Read a story, damn it.

1894
02:33:37,386 --> 02:33:38,046
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what, Rob?

1895
02:33:39,067 --> 02:33:39,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Pet the pussy.

1896
02:33:41,848 --> 02:33:42,848
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just reading chat room.

1897
02:33:42,948 --> 02:33:43,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Come here, Sanrio.

1898
02:33:43,669 --> 02:33:44,769
[SPEAKER_13]: She came out for a little bit.

1899
02:33:44,789 --> 02:33:45,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I was surprised.

1900
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:47,691
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura said to pet you.

1901
02:33:48,482 --> 02:34:00,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Now this is one thing that is super cool, if we can get away from the bullshittery of, you know, fake reporting and all the gun violence and pussies.

1902
02:34:00,557 --> 02:34:01,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody.

1903
02:34:01,558 --> 02:34:01,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody.

1904
02:34:02,401 --> 02:34:05,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Those two last statements do go well together.

1905
02:34:05,321 --> 02:34:05,722
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1906
02:34:05,742 --> 02:34:06,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

1907
02:34:06,782 --> 02:34:13,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I was trying to tie it in, but I'm so flustered right now because of the Cyber Monday event for Rosetta Stone ad that's on this page.

1908
02:34:14,663 --> 02:34:15,423
[SPEAKER_13]: No, seriously.

1909
02:34:15,983 --> 02:34:29,646
[SPEAKER_13]: There are a team of neuroscientists at the University of Pennsylvania and Friedberg University that are using video games where people go through virtual towns, basically just delivering... Oh, you know what?

1910
02:34:29,666 --> 02:34:31,246
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like they're using fucking Animal Crossing.

1911
02:34:32,326 --> 02:34:53,128
[SPEAKER_13]: but I mean they're going around and delivering stuff in these locations in the game but they're looking at how the brain encodes spatial information to form I guess location tags for memories and basically there's actually a mental technique I don't know if anyone's ever heard of something called the mind palace

1912
02:34:54,729 --> 02:35:14,137
[SPEAKER_13]: basically where for you to remember certain information you visualize rooms in a palace and it's mapping it's using spatial mapping to instead trigger a memory and it sounds like this is sort of what they're doing but they're also using this more as a study for epilepsy

1913
02:35:15,117 --> 02:35:15,958
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1914
02:35:35,916 --> 02:35:45,141
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know for me in particular, and I know I haven't been overly verbal on this, but at the end of January I was diagnosed with autism.

1915
02:35:46,221 --> 02:35:49,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to go repeat myself a bajillion times and kill people.

1916
02:35:50,103 --> 02:35:51,044
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that doesn't happen.

1917
02:35:52,004 --> 02:36:03,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the whole thing too is that it's actually been how I remember a lot of stuff is by remembering visually what, where I was, what I did.

1918
02:36:03,633 --> 02:36:12,420
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't remember the name of this one shop for the record until I was standing at Ikea facing the direction that the shop was in and then I remembered the name of it, for example.

1919
02:36:13,061 --> 02:36:16,984
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so it's, it's definitely got a bit of a

1920
02:36:18,638 --> 02:36:19,359
[SPEAKER_13]: A definite interest.

1921
02:36:19,379 --> 02:36:32,377
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we're talking about that Mind Palace technique having been a mental memory building tool that's been in existence since before the current era.

1922
02:36:32,537 --> 02:36:34,039
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been in existence for...

1923
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:36,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1924
02:36:52,208 --> 02:36:53,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Games doing good.

1925
02:36:53,068 --> 02:36:57,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate a story like that after the fuckery we had a couple stories ago.

1926
02:36:58,509 --> 02:36:59,389
[SPEAKER_13]: There's another thing, too.

1927
02:37:00,489 --> 02:37:03,390
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to read this because it is kind of technical, but I'm going to quote it.

1928
02:37:04,910 --> 02:37:14,812
[SPEAKER_13]: It says, During navigation, neurons in the hippocampus and neighboring regions can often represent the patient's virtual location within the town, kind of like a brain GPS device.

1929
02:37:15,372 --> 02:37:21,273
[SPEAKER_13]: These so-called play cells are perhaps the most striking example of a neuron that encodes an abstract cognitive representation.

1930
02:37:21,653 --> 02:37:28,518
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically where they're visualizing themselves in their game environment is where their mind is visualizing the data that they're researching too.

1931
02:37:29,038 --> 02:37:36,483
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, there's a tie between how we think what we remember and how we access our memories.

1932
02:37:36,523 --> 02:37:37,984
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's fantastic that they're doing this.

1933
02:37:38,024 --> 02:37:38,804
[SPEAKER_13]: And hi, Sanrio.

1934
02:37:39,965 --> 02:37:40,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Kitty.

1935
02:37:40,645 --> 02:37:41,706
[SPEAKER_13]: No, she's in the living room.

1936
02:37:42,438 --> 02:37:42,858
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1937
02:37:57,074 --> 02:37:59,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I think that some... No, there was only one.

1938
02:38:00,657 --> 02:38:01,598
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll read it.

1939
02:38:02,379 --> 02:38:04,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, Olari-ees.

1940
02:38:05,521 --> 02:38:09,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a fairly decent income, and the purchase of both systems really hit my savings hard.

1941
02:38:09,785 --> 02:38:14,729
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see why most everyone will only get one of either the PS4 or the Xbox One.

1942
02:38:15,329 --> 02:38:20,594
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they are both solid and with good games, but I like the games on the Xbox One a little better.

1943
02:38:20,994 --> 02:38:23,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I can sum up my comparison of the systems with an analogy.

1944
02:38:24,497 --> 02:38:28,360
[SPEAKER_13]: The PlayStation is like someone handing out candy to everyone in the form of a roll of Mentos.

1945
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:32,143
[SPEAKER_13]: The Xbox is like someone grabbing handfuls of candy and throwing them into a crowd.

1946
02:38:32,423 --> 02:38:33,103
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like Mardi Gras.

1947
02:38:33,924 --> 02:38:35,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Enjoy and remember to brush your teeth.

1948
02:38:35,405 --> 02:38:35,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Rababa.

1949
02:38:37,547 --> 02:38:37,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

1950
02:38:37,927 --> 02:38:38,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I will brush my teeth.

1951
02:38:39,188 --> 02:38:39,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Rababa.

1952
02:38:41,450 --> 02:38:45,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could have been in the situation where I could buy both consoles this year.

1953
02:38:45,573 --> 02:38:48,675
[SPEAKER_04]: If I wasn't in debt after my last Disneyland trip, I would.

1954
02:38:48,835 --> 02:38:50,977
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to be in the position where I can just go to Disneyland.

1955
02:38:52,262 --> 02:38:53,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon, soon.

1956
02:38:54,384 --> 02:38:55,805
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1957
02:38:55,865 --> 02:39:00,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to make some crazy analogies on the show in the future.

1958
02:39:00,548 --> 02:39:01,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be awesome.

1959
02:39:02,069 --> 02:39:03,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1960
02:39:04,171 --> 02:39:11,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Now is the part of the show where we get a little bit angry, even though, you know, there's been a lot of happy stuff tonight.

1961
02:39:12,457 --> 02:39:17,161
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to balance that with some anger and rawr because FUs of the week.

1962
02:39:33,291 --> 02:39:39,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I am actually not very angry today, except for, I mean, the usual stuff.

1963
02:39:40,813 --> 02:39:41,953
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I guess I'm pretty angry.

1964
02:39:42,173 --> 02:39:42,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Not really.

1965
02:39:43,033 --> 02:39:44,433
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm angry on behalf of Becky.

1966
02:39:45,074 --> 02:39:53,695
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very glad that I did not get hired where she is employed at, and I cannot go into more detail because I was advised of a lot in confidence.

1967
02:39:54,436 --> 02:39:55,656
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, fuck that place.

1968
02:39:55,716 --> 02:39:56,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck it a lot.

1969
02:39:58,685 --> 02:39:59,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if that's it.

1970
02:39:59,646 --> 02:40:17,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and also, fuck Bitchface Vicky, who was my ex-boss, who sold the company to the current place, for, um, and I heard about this, so again, not something I can prove and just nail her ass to the wall about, but for apparently bad-mouthing me to the current owner of the company, because she couldn't handle it.

1971
02:40:18,582 --> 02:40:19,823
[SPEAKER_13]: She thinks I was trying to ruin her business.

1972
02:40:20,043 --> 02:40:22,806
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what, if I was trying to ruin your business, it would have been gone before you sold it.

1973
02:40:24,127 --> 02:40:25,327
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't change your passwords.

1974
02:40:25,547 --> 02:40:25,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Duh.

1975
02:40:26,387 --> 02:40:27,868
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki.

1976
02:40:28,668 --> 02:40:31,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Rob, for not playing Grand Theft Auto V yet.

1977
02:40:31,789 --> 02:40:33,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only $39.99 on Amazon.

1978
02:40:34,389 --> 02:40:34,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1979
02:40:35,189 --> 02:40:35,929
[SPEAKER_03]: On PS3?

1980
02:40:35,949 --> 02:40:36,450
[SPEAKER_03]: On PS3.

1981
02:40:39,270 --> 02:40:44,511
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Loki for trying to get me to spend more money when I already spent too much on goddamn Steam sales.

1982
02:40:44,571 --> 02:40:46,031
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least all the Steam games are really good.

1983
02:40:46,332 --> 02:40:47,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't be too upset.

1984
02:40:48,072 --> 02:40:48,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason.

1985
02:40:49,983 --> 02:41:08,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say that I'm happy little bunny this week, and that's mostly true, but amusingly and perhaps not at all surprisingly enough to last week's FU, I'm having a weird snafu with the parking garage that I'm in right now, and people are being very silly and blaming me for something...

1986
02:41:10,455 --> 02:41:17,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's a dresser or something at the end of my parking spot and people are telling me to move the extra three inches in.

1987
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:21,122
[SPEAKER_05]: That dresser is not ours.

1988
02:41:21,322 --> 02:41:23,383
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not part of our unit.

1989
02:41:23,584 --> 02:41:27,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So I need to figure out whose it is so I can actually pull in the whole way to the parking lot.

1990
02:41:29,324 --> 02:41:29,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1991
02:41:29,584 --> 02:41:36,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, San Francisco-type parking, you can understand how being even that much further away from your normal spot would be detrimental, admittedly.

1992
02:41:37,630 --> 02:41:38,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Parking in San Francisco?

1993
02:41:39,111 --> 02:41:39,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1994
02:41:39,891 --> 02:41:40,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Terror.

1995
02:41:40,852 --> 02:41:41,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Terror.

1996
02:41:41,272 --> 02:41:41,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1997
02:41:42,613 --> 02:41:42,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1998
02:41:43,134 --> 02:41:43,934
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to terror.

1999
02:41:44,755 --> 02:41:45,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more stories for you guys.

2000
02:41:46,456 --> 02:41:46,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

2001
02:41:46,976 --> 02:41:50,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of terror, Lindsay Lohan...

2002
02:41:53,104 --> 02:42:17,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Segue of the year goes to Lindsay Lohan is now allegedly suing Rockstar Games over GTA 5 because there is, you know, the whole game takes place in like a Hollywood environment and there's, you know, different celebrities and stuff that you run into and, you know, they act very cliche like some of these celebrities might.

2003
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:21,723
[SPEAKER_03]: But she thinks that one of those characters is directly based off of her

2004
02:42:23,405 --> 02:42:24,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck with that.

2005
02:42:24,766 --> 02:42:27,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, um... No.

2006
02:42:27,967 --> 02:42:28,127
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2007
02:42:28,228 --> 02:42:30,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we have, like, laws for parody?

2008
02:42:30,329 --> 02:42:45,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely parody, and there's not a character that's just exactly... It's all of the different, you know, female celebrities that are... On the flip side, how much do we actually believe that Lindsay Lohan would be suing a frickin' video game?

2009
02:42:46,037 --> 02:42:46,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really?

2010
02:42:46,797 --> 02:42:46,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

2011
02:42:49,964 --> 02:42:51,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Besides that, parody is protected.

2012
02:42:51,445 --> 02:42:55,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure this news isn't coming from Kotaku, is it?

2013
02:42:55,266 --> 02:42:56,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it sounds like the type of story they'd write.

2014
02:42:56,726 --> 02:42:58,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's better or worse.

2015
02:43:00,188 --> 02:43:00,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, never mind.

2016
02:43:01,008 --> 02:43:02,428
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming from TMZ.

2017
02:43:03,229 --> 02:43:03,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

2018
02:43:05,489 --> 02:43:06,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

2019
02:43:06,670 --> 02:43:10,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's just probably why everyone doubted the... It's about the same level.

2020
02:43:10,671 --> 02:43:12,192
[SPEAKER_13]: ...death reporting yesterday, too.

2021
02:43:12,212 --> 02:43:12,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

2022
02:43:13,912 --> 02:43:14,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right.

2023
02:43:14,993 --> 02:43:18,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if TMZ reported it, Loki, it must be true, so...

2024
02:43:19,167 --> 02:43:28,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, she's claiming that, I love that, I'm going to direct quote this because of their wording, claiming that video game honchos jacked her image without her permission.

2025
02:43:29,518 --> 02:43:30,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Who uses honcho anymore?

2026
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:33,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, somebody does.

2027
02:43:35,084 --> 02:43:36,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Some TMZ staffer.

2028
02:43:38,712 --> 02:43:39,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever to that.

2029
02:43:40,313 --> 02:43:43,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck, Lindsay Lohan, and good luck, TMZ.

2030
02:43:43,514 --> 02:43:44,735
[SPEAKER_04]: You're both going to need it.

2031
02:43:45,555 --> 02:43:48,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, good luck to all of you that were awaiting this new console.

2032
02:43:48,516 --> 02:43:51,297
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually sounded really awesome, and I was looking forward to this.

2033
02:43:51,377 --> 02:44:02,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping to maybe pick one up at some point, but it's going to have to wait until next year because the Retron 5 console, or the Retro N, I think Retron's a better name, but Retro N or whatever, the Retro N5 console is...

2034
02:44:02,782 --> 02:44:03,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Faulty Pins Discovered in Some Packaged Units

2035
02:44:29,105 --> 02:44:33,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least they're doing the right thing and pulling it and fixing the problem as opposed to selling some crap units.

2036
02:44:34,470 --> 02:44:38,854
[SPEAKER_04]: So, unfortunately, if you were hoping to get one on its release date, December 10th, too bad.

2037
02:44:39,134 --> 02:44:39,435
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't.

2038
02:44:40,616 --> 02:44:40,856
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2039
02:44:42,097 --> 02:44:42,437
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

2040
02:44:42,517 --> 02:44:47,082
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for the news we had in our show role tonight, but we are going to open up the sky blind.

2041
02:44:47,122 --> 02:44:48,803
[SPEAKER_13]: We're actually kind of on schedule, too, now.

2042
02:44:48,903 --> 02:44:51,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we made up the time there in Part B. Are you okay, Alan?

2043
02:44:53,012 --> 02:44:53,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought he fell.

2044
02:44:53,792 --> 02:44:54,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought he tripped.

2045
02:44:54,373 --> 02:44:55,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't it sound like he tripped in there?

2046
02:44:55,453 --> 02:44:55,994
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

2047
02:44:56,034 --> 02:44:56,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2048
02:44:56,354 --> 02:44:57,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, my God.

2049
02:44:57,715 --> 02:44:59,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to call 911 mid-show.

2050
02:44:59,195 --> 02:44:59,456
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2051
02:44:59,476 --> 02:45:03,958
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number, or you can call us on Skype.

2052
02:45:04,178 --> 02:45:11,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, is the place to give us a call if you want to be on the show to talk about whatever we talked about tonight or maybe something that we missed.

2053
02:45:11,482 --> 02:45:11,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

2054
02:45:12,243 --> 02:45:21,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But while we wait for the calls to come in, Loki, I'll quickly call on you for any last-minute stories, and I'll go to our Twitter as well for any Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

2055
02:45:22,248 --> 02:45:30,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to mention again, you know, because I do like Just Cause and because the multiplayer, seriously, the videos in the multiplayer look fucking crazy.

2056
02:45:31,455 --> 02:45:36,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're interested, Just Cause 2, it's like $2.99 right now on Steam.

2057
02:45:36,759 --> 02:45:37,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally worth it.

2058
02:45:37,979 --> 02:45:41,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you want to get into the Just Cause multiplayer beta...

2059
02:45:41,782 --> 02:45:43,163
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2060
02:46:07,967 --> 02:46:08,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2061
02:46:19,517 --> 02:46:20,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

2062
02:46:20,518 --> 02:46:21,719
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you good, sir?

2063
02:46:22,119 --> 02:46:26,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm great, and I'm realizing with all the conventions you go to, I think I need to send you some of my balls.

2064
02:46:27,423 --> 02:46:28,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2065
02:46:28,104 --> 02:46:31,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use some of your balls and spread the love around.

2066
02:46:32,367 --> 02:46:33,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Spread my balls all over.

2067
02:46:33,488 --> 02:46:34,128
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like fun.

2068
02:46:34,149 --> 02:46:36,270
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll just take Rob's balls and throw them at everyone.

2069
02:46:36,630 --> 02:46:38,192
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, they're not actually my balls.

2070
02:46:38,212 --> 02:46:39,012
[SPEAKER_04]: They're Grandpa's balls.

2071
02:46:39,593 --> 02:46:40,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2072
02:46:40,073 --> 02:46:41,774
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave them all to me.

2073
02:46:42,715 --> 02:46:50,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to know, you should be thankful that Mako isn't listening right now because she'll be squeeing over the fact that she gets to play with your balls.

2074
02:46:53,081 --> 02:46:54,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully she'll hear it on the podcast feed.

2075
02:46:54,682 --> 02:46:56,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a good thing they're not sweaty balls.

2076
02:46:58,104 --> 02:47:10,248
[SPEAKER_04]: If you missed the first part of the show, Grandpa Matt from Horde House got a bunch of little hacky sacks with the VOG logo and website URL printed on them as giveaways for BlizzCon.

2077
02:47:10,268 --> 02:47:17,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he only gave about half of them away, so now we're going to pass them on to other VOG hosts and so forth to hand them out at later conventions.

2078
02:47:17,990 --> 02:47:21,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we talk about our balls, they are balls!

2079
02:47:21,826 --> 02:47:22,526
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of squishy.

2080
02:47:23,187 --> 02:47:23,827
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fun to play with.

2081
02:47:23,887 --> 02:47:25,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And our balls have balls.

2082
02:47:25,708 --> 02:47:28,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I'm sure you didn't call in just to talk about balls.

2083
02:47:28,709 --> 02:47:29,530
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind?

2084
02:47:29,770 --> 02:47:31,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you... Sorry.

2085
02:47:31,931 --> 02:47:36,413
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know I didn't call... Well, surprise me.

2086
02:47:36,513 --> 02:47:37,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Then let's talk balls.

2087
02:47:39,269 --> 02:47:42,692
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, did not come to talk balls.

2088
02:47:42,712 --> 02:47:46,135
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of things I want to talk about from tonight's discussion.

2089
02:47:47,476 --> 02:47:51,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I understand that OLR is a place where every person has their voice.

2090
02:47:52,300 --> 02:47:59,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in response to that one person who wrote in about how you guys are being biased towards one console.

2091
02:48:00,167 --> 02:48:00,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2092
02:48:01,868 --> 02:48:04,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit happens.

2093
02:48:04,270 --> 02:48:04,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit happens.

2094
02:48:05,421 --> 02:48:15,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, on our podcast, we talk about different things, but sometimes we get on one topic or one company for a while, and it's like, well, that's what everybody is talking about.

2095
02:48:15,810 --> 02:48:22,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because we're talking about it as well, that does not mean what we're saying is the same as everybody else.

2096
02:48:23,637 --> 02:48:26,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and I do want to remind you, it wasn't just one person.

2097
02:48:26,740 --> 02:48:28,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I only read one thing on the air.

2098
02:48:28,662 --> 02:48:30,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and one thing is that

2099
02:48:32,156 --> 02:48:34,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone gets their turn in the barrel.

2100
02:48:34,218 --> 02:48:39,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for that point, for a while, it was Xbox One's turn to be in the barrel.

2101
02:48:39,803 --> 02:48:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how the news goes.

2102
02:48:42,926 --> 02:48:44,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's very true.

2103
02:48:45,007 --> 02:48:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: The same thing happens in politics, right?

2104
02:48:47,610 --> 02:48:53,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's the red team, or sometimes it's the blue team, or sometimes it's all of them, honestly.

2105
02:48:54,055 --> 02:48:59,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it just kind of depends on what the public eye is watching.

2106
02:49:00,031 --> 02:49:09,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, like, for example, when Heroes of Cosplay was on TV, all the blogs, all the podcasts, all everybody was talking about was Heroes of Cosplay.

2107
02:49:09,437 --> 02:49:17,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're talking about it, but we're like, yeah, we watch it only because I'm drinking when I'm watching it and I'm giving my personal spin on it.

2108
02:49:17,321 --> 02:49:21,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot more entertaining as comparing to what everybody else is saying about the show.

2109
02:49:21,764 --> 02:49:26,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw that there was some, because you know, everything's got to have an internet petition these days.

2110
02:49:26,445 --> 02:49:31,726
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some internet petition going around to make it fairly represent cosplay.

2111
02:49:31,766 --> 02:49:34,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was kind of like, well, then it wouldn't really be.

2112
02:49:34,287 --> 02:49:35,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's TV, right?

2113
02:49:36,267 --> 02:49:42,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And funny enough, I don't know if you heard the interview with Matt, but we were joking at the end there about his time on the America's Worst Driver.

2114
02:49:42,248 --> 02:49:44,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was TV.

2115
02:49:44,289 --> 02:49:45,029
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a TV show.

2116
02:49:45,849 --> 02:49:51,494
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that you brought up there as a petition, I wanted to put my headset down and just start falling over with laughter.

2117
02:49:52,575 --> 02:50:00,502
[SPEAKER_02]: How well you try to put a positive spin on cosplay, as soon as it hits TV, it's nothing but drama, drama, drama, drama, drama.

2118
02:50:00,782 --> 02:50:03,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are complaining about how it's going to wreck the community.

2119
02:50:03,304 --> 02:50:04,625
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we just brought everybody together.

2120
02:50:05,146 --> 02:50:09,690
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, if somebody did a reality show about Orange Lounge Radio, there'd be drama.

2121
02:50:09,810 --> 02:50:11,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, the shit-talking.

2122
02:50:12,112 --> 02:50:12,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

2123
02:50:12,832 --> 02:50:18,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what TV does and that's what would happen even though, you know what, we all get along mostly.

2124
02:50:18,958 --> 02:50:20,660
[SPEAKER_04]: No, for real.

2125
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:22,622
[SPEAKER_04]: We all get along great when it comes to time to do the show.

2126
02:50:22,642 --> 02:50:24,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be able to run for president.

2127
02:50:24,924 --> 02:50:26,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have our disagreements behind the scenes?

2128
02:50:26,866 --> 02:50:29,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, once in a while, but they're disagreements among friends.

2129
02:50:29,048 --> 02:50:29,628
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we don't.

2130
02:50:29,768 --> 02:50:30,629
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't, shut up.

2131
02:50:30,649 --> 02:50:31,850
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

2132
02:50:32,051 --> 02:50:32,891
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know shit.

2133
02:50:33,592 --> 02:50:34,393
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm totally judging you.

2134
02:50:35,353 --> 02:50:47,119
[SPEAKER_04]: No, in all seriousness, any argument we have behind the scenes, I think if any friendship goes forever with no disagreements, that's almost boring.

2135
02:50:49,300 --> 02:50:55,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, on the same token, when you're arguing, it kind of brings the friendship stronger because you got points of view that you bring it to the table.

2136
02:50:56,163 --> 02:50:56,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2137
02:50:57,304 --> 02:51:00,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you're tired of arguing, you look at Jamie like,

2138
02:51:00,845 --> 02:51:02,326
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2139
02:51:26,759 --> 02:51:27,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2140
02:51:27,460 --> 02:51:33,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob, even though you said you're the only gay nerd in your town, I feel you.

2141
02:51:33,224 --> 02:51:35,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I was the only black nerd in my town.

2142
02:51:35,866 --> 02:51:38,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm the only one that's renting anime.

2143
02:51:38,668 --> 02:51:39,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just me?

2144
02:51:41,209 --> 02:51:42,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely not just you.

2145
02:51:42,550 --> 02:51:43,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2146
02:51:43,491 --> 02:51:45,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured that out about a couple of years later.

2147
02:51:45,352 --> 02:51:46,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm not the only one.

2148
02:51:51,057 --> 02:51:52,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel better about myself now.

2149
02:52:11,651 --> 02:52:12,151
[SPEAKER_02]: True that.

2150
02:52:13,352 --> 02:52:13,592
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2151
02:52:13,612 --> 02:52:14,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, take care, Ranma.

2152
02:52:14,572 --> 02:52:15,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much for the call.

2153
02:52:15,353 --> 02:52:15,813
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good one.

2154
02:52:16,433 --> 02:52:17,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, no problem.

2155
02:52:17,354 --> 02:52:23,556
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, just because I have a GameStop Power-Up Rewards card, that doesn't mean you get to fully judge me.

2156
02:52:25,097 --> 02:52:25,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

2157
02:52:25,757 --> 02:52:26,157
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2158
02:52:27,378 --> 02:52:28,378
[SPEAKER_04]: No judgment happening here.

2159
02:52:28,638 --> 02:52:31,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranchan, you know what I am totally not doing right now?

2160
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:34,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Not judging me, but I will say this.

2161
02:52:34,381 --> 02:52:35,541
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not not judging you.

2162
02:52:35,641 --> 02:52:36,702
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just not judging you.

2163
02:52:39,253 --> 02:52:40,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just say this and I'll get out of here.

2164
02:52:40,734 --> 02:52:41,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I'm Bobby Show.

2165
02:52:42,674 --> 02:52:52,678
[SPEAKER_02]: When you guys find out that I actually paid for a membership for the Power Pro Rewards, y'all can come to my house, kick my ass, take all my consoles, and leave.

2166
02:52:52,878 --> 02:52:55,039
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, I no longer deserve to be a gamer.

2167
02:52:56,400 --> 02:52:58,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hold you to that because I want some new consoles.

2168
02:52:59,982 --> 02:53:02,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's why I called in to put it on public record.

2169
02:53:02,284 --> 02:53:02,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

2170
02:53:03,364 --> 02:53:03,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2171
02:53:04,045 --> 02:53:05,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here at VOG.

2172
02:53:05,866 --> 02:53:06,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen.

2173
02:53:06,926 --> 02:53:07,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Got that right.

2174
02:53:07,607 --> 02:53:07,827
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2175
02:53:07,847 --> 02:53:08,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2176
02:53:08,808 --> 02:53:10,008
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2177
02:53:10,128 --> 02:53:10,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2178
02:53:10,469 --> 02:53:13,550
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2179
02:53:13,590 --> 02:53:15,852
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have another call coming in, so let's get to it.

2180
02:53:15,892 --> 02:53:16,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2181
02:53:16,872 --> 02:53:17,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2182
02:53:18,253 --> 02:53:18,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, guys?

2183
02:53:18,834 --> 02:53:19,474
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kai Judo.

2184
02:53:19,714 --> 02:53:20,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Kai Judo.

2185
02:53:20,355 --> 02:53:20,955
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2186
02:53:21,940 --> 02:53:29,877
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, you always say this is the show where every gamer has a voice and I just want to voice my opinion on this whole supposed console war do it

2187
02:53:30,825 --> 02:53:37,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me, okay, it can be said that I'm more on the side of PlayStation 4, like, I'll admit that, like, right away.

2188
02:53:37,671 --> 02:53:42,355
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not so much where it's, you know, for me, it's not really Sony versus Microsoft.

2189
02:53:42,395 --> 02:53:44,798
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really their policies that really piss me off.

2190
02:53:44,838 --> 02:53:47,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that, you know, I've been gaming for a long time.

2191
02:53:47,640 --> 02:53:49,642
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, since the early 80s, I've been gaming.

2192
02:53:50,343 --> 02:53:54,006
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just see a trend happening that I don't like in gaming, which...

2193
02:53:54,907 --> 02:54:11,394
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I'm actually prevents me from playing a lot of games these days just for the simple fact that a lot of stuff is becoming I call it pay-as-you-play with all this microtransaction shit Microsoft is pushing that all this crap about you know where you know where you can lend your games and who you can lend it to the crappy

2194
02:54:12,964 --> 02:54:17,711
[SPEAKER_00]: The freaking codes that they give you so that you can't sell your game at GameStop.

2195
02:54:17,751 --> 02:54:18,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I do that.

2196
02:54:18,653 --> 02:54:20,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I like to just buy games brand new anyway.

2197
02:54:20,816 --> 02:54:21,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Online pass?

2198
02:54:21,397 --> 02:54:22,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're talking about?

2199
02:54:22,899 --> 02:54:23,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, online pass.

2200
02:54:24,001 --> 02:54:26,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hate the fact that it seems like...

2201
02:54:29,063 --> 02:54:35,028
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the type of person where you trade your games or you might not have internet access or whatever, it just seems like they're cutting those people out.

2202
02:54:35,068 --> 02:54:38,490
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, there's still people out there that don't have all these luxuries.

2203
02:54:39,371 --> 02:54:43,594
[SPEAKER_00]: For you to just cut those people out, it really just rubs me the wrong way.

2204
02:54:43,634 --> 02:54:46,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been anti-Microsoft for the longest time now.

2205
02:54:46,557 --> 02:54:52,341
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even checked into Xbox Live in I don't know how many days, I think, since this past summer.

2206
02:54:52,401 --> 02:54:57,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my own type of little boycott that you could call it again.

2207
02:54:57,125 --> 02:54:58,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just Microsoft, but I mean...

2208
02:54:59,292 --> 02:55:03,917
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the different game developers and companies that they do things that I don't necessarily agree with.

2209
02:55:04,358 --> 02:55:05,980
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the list is huge.

2210
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:07,621
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many things that's going on right now.

2211
02:55:19,935 --> 02:55:23,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them that enacted the online pass have since sunsetted it.

2212
02:55:23,837 --> 02:55:25,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's only a couple stragglers out there.

2213
02:55:26,058 --> 02:55:31,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And to Microsoft's credit, they never enacted the online pass on their first party games.

2214
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:36,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we would have all raked them over the coals if they had because they were already charging a fee for Xbox Live.

2215
02:55:36,983 --> 02:55:38,864
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's neither here nor there.

2216
02:55:38,984 --> 02:55:41,645
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess my point I'm trying to make with this is...

2217
02:55:42,265 --> 02:55:54,532
[SPEAKER_04]: When a company comes out and says, you know what, we were wrong, we made the wrong decision, which I think Microsoft kind of did since E3, is that not what you want?

2218
02:55:54,752 --> 02:55:59,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what can the gaming companies do to win your fandom back?

2219
02:56:00,975 --> 02:56:07,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, I mean, you know, just pretty much, I would say, as far as when it comes to...

2220
02:56:08,607 --> 02:56:12,210
[SPEAKER_00]: lending your games out, trading your games.

2221
02:56:12,650 --> 02:56:16,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, people like to go into GameStop and sell them, whatever.

2222
02:56:16,053 --> 02:56:23,139
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as that type of stuff goes, don't try to put all these policies to get extra money out of people that do that.

2223
02:56:23,339 --> 02:56:26,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Let people do what they've been doing for years.

2224
02:56:26,722 --> 02:56:27,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't interfere with that.

2225
02:56:28,083 --> 02:56:31,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Sell your game for $59.99 once the person buys it.

2226
02:56:32,426 --> 02:56:34,708
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be your income right there.

2227
02:56:34,748 --> 02:56:38,171
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't charge people again to trade something in or

2228
02:56:38,732 --> 02:56:40,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the other crap that you're doing out there.

2229
02:56:40,614 --> 02:56:43,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me buy my shit and own my shit.

2230
02:56:43,277 --> 02:56:45,500
[SPEAKER_04]: When I pay 60 bucks for your game, I own that game.

2231
02:56:46,581 --> 02:56:46,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

2232
02:56:46,901 --> 02:56:49,604
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially with, like I said, with these microtransactions.

2233
02:56:49,624 --> 02:56:54,830
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody's pretty much getting their hands dirty into something.

2234
02:56:54,850 --> 02:56:55,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even Steam.

2235
02:56:56,131 --> 02:56:59,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I would even go out to Steam and say that a few things that they're doing.

2236
02:57:00,132 --> 02:57:01,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily agree with this.

2237
02:57:01,494 --> 02:57:06,139
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys are aware of this, but they have this new thing now where it's the early access.

2238
02:57:06,439 --> 02:57:07,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys seen this?

2239
02:57:07,420 --> 02:57:07,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I have.

2240
02:57:08,041 --> 02:57:10,864
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I actually have a game with early access.

2241
02:57:11,064 --> 02:57:12,686
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bought into that too.

2242
02:57:12,706 --> 02:57:14,989
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have two games that are early access.

2243
02:57:15,329 --> 02:57:18,493
[SPEAKER_00]: They pretty much, from what I can see, they look like they're completed games.

2244
02:57:19,173 --> 02:57:20,415
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at it, you're like...

2245
02:57:21,704 --> 02:57:22,724
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is going on now?

2246
02:57:22,744 --> 02:57:27,006
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually paying now for incomplete games.

2247
02:57:27,186 --> 02:57:28,306
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like alpha games.

2248
02:57:28,326 --> 02:57:29,947
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even in beta.

2249
02:57:30,107 --> 02:57:31,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Minecraft.

2250
02:57:31,707 --> 02:57:35,589
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting, though, about that, Kaijudo, is I think Kickstarter showed that there was a market for that.

2251
02:57:36,542 --> 02:57:36,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, true.

2252
02:58:02,637 --> 02:58:03,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of said, you know what?

2253
02:58:03,978 --> 02:58:07,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it really depends how much they're going to charge for a game.

2254
02:58:07,580 --> 02:58:14,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still kind of stand by that because I would have been totally fine with Microsoft's new policies if they were only charging $20, $30 for the game.

2255
02:58:14,885 --> 02:58:17,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that what was going to bring the price down from the $60 limit?

2256
02:58:17,907 --> 02:58:19,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, let's be real, is still a little high.

2257
02:58:20,389 --> 02:58:29,475
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the perks of Steam and one of the reasons why people use Steam, Steam sale and being able to buy games for literally a dollar.

2258
02:58:29,975 --> 02:58:32,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought DLC Quest for a dollar.

2259
02:58:32,918 --> 02:58:37,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's kind of one of those, alright, so it's a digital copy and I'll never be able to sell it back.

2260
02:58:37,525 --> 02:58:38,527
[SPEAKER_04]: It cost me a dollar.

2261
02:58:39,228 --> 02:58:40,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like totally okay with that.

2262
02:58:41,707 --> 02:58:48,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just finished getting all the DLC that I needed for Skyrim and also picking up Morrowind on Steam.

2263
02:58:48,689 --> 02:58:50,429
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I like Steam for that.

2264
02:58:50,529 --> 02:58:58,211
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, like I said, it just looks like, to me, I just don't like the direction that things seem to be going.

2265
02:58:58,491 --> 02:59:02,772
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I'm so anti-Microsoft is just for the simple fact that

2266
02:59:03,479 --> 02:59:19,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside me even though I'm pretty sure that um, you know, I'm a little man here and may never be affected But for me, it's like I feel okay Microsoft is kind of leading this charge if I could find some way to what to you know, not not really the not really to

2267
02:59:22,014 --> 02:59:39,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really to make people go my way or see things my way, but if I could find some way to just pretty much let them know that we don't agree with this or whatever, maybe they'll start to change their policies like they did with the Xbox One, how they reverted everything back.

2268
02:59:39,829 --> 02:59:50,022
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm just hoping that if more people hop on that and more people get on Microsoft and all the other people that are doing these types of things then maybe we'll be able to get some balance.

2269
02:59:50,423 --> 02:59:52,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want some balance in the gaming world.

2270
02:59:52,686 --> 02:59:53,507
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like it's that.

2271
02:59:53,547 --> 02:59:55,710
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems like pretty soon they're just going to

2272
02:59:56,724 --> 03:00:11,109
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they're just gonna walk all over the little man and there isn't much that can be done unless unless us as gamers you know we stop with all this console war crap and we see things for what they are you know we tell them hey you know we don't like we don't like micro transactions or you know maybe you can fix it

2273
03:00:12,249 --> 03:00:14,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff like that.

2274
03:00:14,131 --> 03:00:22,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get this out before we let you go because I think this is important to say because you know there's going to be people sitting at home or in the office listening to this podcast right now that is thinking this guy is crazy.

2275
03:00:22,800 --> 03:00:23,981
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy needs to let it go.

2276
03:00:24,321 --> 03:00:26,283
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy has too much hatred.

2277
03:00:27,445 --> 03:00:29,226
[SPEAKER_04]: You know there's people sitting there thinking that right now, right?

2278
03:00:29,306 --> 03:00:30,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, of course.

2279
03:00:30,568 --> 03:00:31,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I come across it all the time.

2280
03:00:31,949 --> 03:00:36,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, but I think there's a good comment in the chat room that kind of plays into both sides of this here.

2281
03:00:36,613 --> 03:00:37,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is important.

2282
03:00:37,554 --> 03:00:44,540
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Chris109 in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying, Yeah, but the damage has been done and it takes time for the wound to heal.

2283
03:00:45,201 --> 03:00:56,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in a way, whether you personally listening to the show think Kaijudo is overreacting or not, I can certainly think, you know, I've gone to a place and I've got bad service or a company did something to really irritate me.

2284
03:00:56,931 --> 03:00:59,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a while before I tried that company again.

2285
03:00:59,753 --> 03:01:00,293
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

2286
03:01:00,633 --> 03:01:08,675
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did go back at some point and either I learned why I stopped doing it in the first place or I was like, all right, things are better.

2287
03:01:08,775 --> 03:01:09,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Things have changed.

2288
03:01:09,555 --> 03:01:10,795
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm happier now.

2289
03:01:11,115 --> 03:01:25,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think, Kaijudo, that maybe that's what's going to happen is that if Microsoft is a little more transparent in some of these policies and kind of gets that community that they've lost, that tapped into the community, if they can get some of that back, that maybe we can heal these wounds?

2290
03:01:26,679 --> 03:01:28,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, me personally,

2291
03:01:31,242 --> 03:01:33,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, I've already made my decision.

2292
03:01:33,824 --> 03:01:36,186
[SPEAKER_00]: My boycott is going to stick.

2293
03:01:36,246 --> 03:01:40,109
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do what I have to do for myself, basically.

2294
03:01:40,309 --> 03:01:50,037
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I don't want to live in that type of gaming world, so the games that I choose to purchase, the companies that I choose to invest in, they don't do any of that right now.

2295
03:01:50,057 --> 03:01:51,738
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing for myself.

2296
03:01:52,339 --> 03:01:58,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm not out here to try and make people see things my way, but I just want people to be aware

2297
03:01:58,874 --> 03:02:03,177
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, the gaming world as it is now is pretty screwed up.

2298
03:02:03,677 --> 03:02:06,079
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just saying that people need to be aware of that.

2299
03:02:06,659 --> 03:02:07,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop with the console world stuff.

2300
03:02:08,120 --> 03:02:12,463
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about Xbox versus PlayStation 3 for some of us out there.

2301
03:02:12,483 --> 03:02:16,686
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of us, it's more about, hey, you know, don't cut the little man out.

2302
03:02:17,307 --> 03:02:21,590
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, remember what gaming was about originally.

2303
03:02:21,950 --> 03:02:23,751
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was originally about fun.

2304
03:02:23,791 --> 03:02:25,993
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, of course, you have companies who, you know, they got to make money.

2305
03:02:26,473 --> 03:02:27,954
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody says it all the time, but I mean...

2306
03:02:28,723 --> 03:02:32,026
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always fun, you know, trading with your friends and all this stuff.

2307
03:02:32,066 --> 03:02:37,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's just becoming way, way too political and way too, like, out of hand with all this crap.

2308
03:02:38,010 --> 03:02:38,691
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm saying.

2309
03:02:38,811 --> 03:02:39,051
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2310
03:02:39,071 --> 03:02:40,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think you make a good point at the end of the day.

2311
03:02:40,993 --> 03:02:45,056
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know what, play the games because there's a lot of good stuff out there right now.

2312
03:02:45,316 --> 03:02:49,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Kaijudo, thank you for the call and for the perspective that could be challenging for some.

2313
03:02:49,399 --> 03:02:49,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

2314
03:02:50,861 --> 03:02:51,081
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2315
03:02:51,141 --> 03:02:51,321
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2316
03:02:51,361 --> 03:02:51,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2317
03:02:53,002 --> 03:02:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2318
03:02:57,303 --> 03:02:57,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2319
03:02:57,943 --> 03:03:06,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, I have to admit, I'm kind of like, I don't, I mean, for me, it's like when Microsoft releases that game, I'm going to have to play.

2320
03:03:06,285 --> 03:03:08,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to kind of let that past go.

2321
03:03:08,605 --> 03:03:13,906
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can understand, too, the whole like, you know, when I really feel like I've been pissed off.

2322
03:03:14,026 --> 03:03:16,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not about to throw 500 bucks at a company anytime soon.

2323
03:03:16,607 --> 03:03:18,227
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very tricky.

2324
03:03:18,387 --> 03:03:18,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Very tricky.

2325
03:03:18,767 --> 03:03:22,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Better be pissed off without the system or buy it and get pissed on.

2326
03:03:23,169 --> 03:03:23,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

2327
03:03:23,549 --> 03:03:25,451
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see if we get any other calls.

2328
03:03:25,972 --> 03:03:28,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep the lines open for a little bit here while we do some Twitter topics.

2329
03:03:28,394 --> 03:03:32,178
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2330
03:03:32,278 --> 03:03:36,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says in the chat room, Kaijudo may hate Microsoft, but at least he's not being a dick about it.

2331
03:03:37,324 --> 03:03:38,144
[SPEAKER_04]: He was very professional.

2332
03:03:38,245 --> 03:03:38,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Very reasonable.

2333
03:03:38,945 --> 03:03:41,027
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, this is why, this is my point.

2334
03:03:41,568 --> 03:03:43,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you think I'm crazy or not, this is how it is.

2335
03:03:45,051 --> 03:03:47,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Thought that was a very well-composed call.

2336
03:03:48,772 --> 03:03:49,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, going to Twitter.

2337
03:03:52,053 --> 03:03:52,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, sorry.

2338
03:03:53,953 --> 03:03:56,613
[SPEAKER_04]: A more professional host would have had Twitter open already, but I didn't.

2339
03:03:57,794 --> 03:04:00,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if I can get to some of the app messages here.

2340
03:04:00,094 --> 03:04:00,774
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

2341
03:04:01,755 --> 03:04:03,795
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt tweets us at twitter.com.

2342
03:04:04,695 --> 03:04:08,896
[SPEAKER_04]: The community at Overclocked Remixed released a Sonic CD remix album.

2343
03:04:09,456 --> 03:04:14,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that he slipped that in there.

2344
03:04:14,841 --> 03:04:15,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And better.

2345
03:04:16,183 --> 03:04:18,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of gaming wars that will never end, there you go.

2346
03:04:18,725 --> 03:04:19,466
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a classic one.

2347
03:04:19,686 --> 03:04:20,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But check that out.

2348
03:04:20,307 --> 03:04:23,029
[SPEAKER_04]: SonicCD.ocremix.org You know what?

2349
03:04:23,249 --> 03:04:27,133
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter which one you prefer, it sounds like there'll be a remix album for you.

2350
03:04:27,533 --> 03:04:28,334
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's go have drinks.

2351
03:04:29,855 --> 03:04:37,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator wants to know, we talk Steam sale here at OLR, is it quote, yay Steam sale, or quote, goddammit a Steam sale?

2352
03:04:38,741 --> 03:04:39,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit of both.

2353
03:04:39,762 --> 03:04:41,663
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B.

2354
03:04:50,729 --> 03:05:19,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what it is for me it's like yay maybe this game I've really wanted to play but I just I wasn't really convinced until it drops in price like I get excited for that but then like where I get pissed off is that oh I bought that and five other games that I wasn't expecting to buy there's something that's actually kind of a kick in the nuts with Steam and that's you put stuff on the wish list and if it's generally on sale they email you but I don't think I've seen any emails from my wish list stuff for these for the autumn sales or winter sales what the hell am I saying

2355
03:05:23,253 --> 03:05:24,133
[SPEAKER_04]: The sale for no reason.

2356
03:05:24,153 --> 03:05:24,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it is autumn sale.

2357
03:05:24,914 --> 03:05:26,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's autumn sale.

2358
03:05:27,135 --> 03:05:28,116
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be a winter sale later.

2359
03:05:28,236 --> 03:05:31,979
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for Christmas-y time.

2360
03:05:32,019 --> 03:05:34,520
[SPEAKER_04]: 1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2361
03:05:35,061 --> 03:05:40,064
[SPEAKER_04]: While I get a few more tweets in here, Marcus Boy saying, I have a feeling tonight's OLR is going to be awesome.

2362
03:05:41,085 --> 03:05:42,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was because you plugged it.

2363
03:05:42,866 --> 03:05:43,647
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate it.

2364
03:05:44,147 --> 03:05:44,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good show tonight.

2365
03:05:45,008 --> 03:05:45,628
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having fun.

2366
03:05:45,808 --> 03:05:46,529
[SPEAKER_04]: You having fun, Jason?

2367
03:05:46,649 --> 03:05:47,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

2368
03:05:47,089 --> 03:05:48,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Worth the drive from San Francisco?

2369
03:05:48,110 --> 03:05:48,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.

2370
03:05:50,191 --> 03:05:54,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time we have an interviewee in San Francisco, I'm going to have you chauffeur him up here.

2371
03:05:54,735 --> 03:06:00,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do that, or I can provide better quality to the individual with my microphone set up and everything else.

2372
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:02,301
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll figure it out.

2373
03:06:02,361 --> 03:06:04,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Flexibility is wonderful.

2374
03:06:04,383 --> 03:06:08,527
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be our man on the street running up and down the Bay Area where all our guests usually are.

2375
03:06:08,547 --> 03:06:10,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't put me in Oakland and I'll be happy.

2376
03:06:11,328 --> 03:06:12,629
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have extra for Handle Oakland.

2377
03:06:12,649 --> 03:06:16,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where he lives.

2378
03:06:18,111 --> 03:06:18,631
[SPEAKER_04]: He can handle it.

2379
03:06:20,212 --> 03:06:23,453
[SPEAKER_04]: 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2380
03:06:24,873 --> 03:06:26,154
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is this tweet?

2381
03:06:26,194 --> 03:06:33,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to read this tweet because the tweet goes to some health company and it says, I was a patient at OLR.

2382
03:06:34,176 --> 03:06:36,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the best care when I had my appendectomy.

2383
03:06:36,737 --> 03:06:37,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2384
03:06:37,198 --> 03:06:37,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy holidays.

2385
03:06:40,284 --> 03:06:46,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God this poor woman wasn't in the presence of Loki playing Surgeon Simulator or her appendectomy may not have gone so well.

2386
03:06:47,066 --> 03:06:47,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Loki?

2387
03:06:48,707 --> 03:06:50,227
[SPEAKER_04]: How the hell did we get that tweet?

2388
03:06:50,367 --> 03:06:50,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Spam.

2389
03:06:50,807 --> 03:06:54,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess probably OLR is some other surgery company or something.

2390
03:06:54,528 --> 03:06:55,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Laparoscopic.

2391
03:06:57,449 --> 03:06:58,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Removing appendix.

2392
03:06:58,029 --> 03:07:00,070
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm thinking of the OLR.

2393
03:07:00,610 --> 03:07:03,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Laparoscopic is when they... No, no, that means the L was for laparoscopic.

2394
03:07:04,721 --> 03:07:06,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, maybe the OLR.

2395
03:07:06,523 --> 03:07:07,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, who knows?

2396
03:07:07,363 --> 03:07:07,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

2397
03:07:07,724 --> 03:07:08,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Something?

2398
03:07:08,604 --> 03:07:09,585
[SPEAKER_11]: I fucking don't know.

2399
03:07:09,705 --> 03:07:13,028
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was spam, then I just gave a plug to something here on air.

2400
03:07:13,108 --> 03:07:14,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Spam, spam, spam, spam.

2401
03:07:14,248 --> 03:07:23,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I just went to that account and their second most recent, retweet in this case, but their second most recent post is retweeting a spaceship blunt.

2402
03:07:25,357 --> 03:07:25,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2403
03:07:25,557 --> 03:07:25,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2404
03:07:26,900 --> 03:07:30,102
[SPEAKER_05]: and they retweet a lot of picture stuff.

2405
03:07:30,402 --> 03:07:30,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

2406
03:07:31,563 --> 03:07:32,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it, love it, love it.

2407
03:07:33,744 --> 03:07:34,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see some other tweets.

2408
03:07:34,864 --> 03:07:39,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaco Jones reminding us that the Bioshock triple pack is only $15 at Amazon.

2409
03:07:40,147 --> 03:07:41,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you, Flaco Jones.

2410
03:07:42,128 --> 03:07:42,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you.

2411
03:07:42,649 --> 03:07:43,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

2412
03:07:43,809 --> 03:07:44,570
[SPEAKER_10]: A long time ago.

2413
03:07:45,450 --> 03:07:45,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's it.

2414
03:07:46,110 --> 03:07:47,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one more call.

2415
03:07:47,551 --> 03:07:51,913
[SPEAKER_04]: One call coming in at the fucking buzzer when I was about to close it down.

2416
03:07:51,974 --> 03:07:52,374
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we go.

2417
03:07:52,434 --> 03:07:52,814
[SPEAKER_04]: One more call.

2418
03:07:53,114 --> 03:07:54,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2419
03:07:54,035 --> 03:07:54,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2420
03:07:55,250 --> 03:07:56,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is Rageinator.

2421
03:07:56,851 --> 03:07:58,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Rage, we see you.

2422
03:07:58,473 --> 03:07:58,813
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

2423
03:07:58,873 --> 03:07:59,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We see you.

2424
03:07:59,293 --> 03:08:00,034
[SPEAKER_12]: How you doing, Rageinator?

2425
03:08:00,254 --> 03:08:03,097
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to turn down your computer, unless that's the only way you hear us.

2426
03:08:03,257 --> 03:08:03,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit.

2427
03:08:03,977 --> 03:08:04,458
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, buddy?

2428
03:08:06,319 --> 03:08:12,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wanted to give, or make a somewhat serious call this week.

2429
03:08:13,005 --> 03:08:14,586
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't make serious calls.

2430
03:08:15,847 --> 03:08:18,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now, all I have

2431
03:08:20,437 --> 03:08:39,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Truth be told, I always have heard the topic as I was dealing with my cat at the time, but I believe the three of you, or, well, four of you were talking about someone, again, linking mental illness in video games to violence.

2432
03:08:40,646 --> 03:08:44,268
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and now,

2433
03:08:47,270 --> 03:08:52,053
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to open up here a little bit and talk about something that I generally don't talk about.

2434
03:08:53,653 --> 03:08:56,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mentally ill myself.

2435
03:08:59,596 --> 03:09:14,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 1998, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, which is also known as PTSD, also known as shell shock.

2436
03:09:17,347 --> 03:09:34,830
[SPEAKER_01]: and as a result between those two diagnoses I generally have a hard time wriggling emotions and sometimes my behavior as a result can be a little bit off.

2437
03:09:35,470 --> 03:09:44,872
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be construed as odd or unusual to someone that may not have to deal with mental illness.

2438
03:09:46,547 --> 03:10:04,211
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, just because someone's mentally ill, regardless of whether they play video games or not, that does not mean they're going to go Norman Bates on someone's ass or go Texas Chainsaw Massacre on someone.

2439
03:10:04,571 --> 03:10:05,632
[SPEAKER_13]: No one said what they did.

2440
03:10:06,532 --> 03:10:11,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think we did, but I think the media sometimes gives that protection.

2441
03:10:11,653 --> 03:10:15,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just saying that's what the general public

2442
03:10:16,269 --> 03:10:28,175
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what the general perception is in society is that if someone has mental illness, that's... That's what we talk about when we talk about the stigma of mental health.

2443
03:10:28,495 --> 03:10:29,256
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's out there.

2444
03:10:29,276 --> 03:10:31,417
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for opening up about that, Raginator.

2445
03:10:31,477 --> 03:10:33,218
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brave of you to say on the show.

2446
03:10:33,598 --> 03:10:34,479
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to say this.

2447
03:10:34,659 --> 03:10:38,661
[SPEAKER_04]: The reality is there's a lot of people like you out there.

2448
03:10:38,821 --> 03:10:39,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny.

2449
03:10:40,042 --> 03:10:43,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I'm talking about earlier in the show, I feel like the only gay nerd...

2450
03:10:44,864 --> 03:10:46,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you're not the only nerd.

2451
03:10:47,305 --> 03:10:50,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Pardon me, but you must be a bit of a nerd if you listen to the show.

2452
03:10:50,485 --> 03:10:56,847
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably by far not the only nerd that suffers from the types of conditions that you're talking about that you just brought up.

2453
03:10:58,727 --> 03:11:05,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I think mental illness is much more common than sometimes the media and the mass perception often gives it credit for.

2454
03:11:05,569 --> 03:11:08,870
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's also so many variant varieties.

2455
03:11:09,531 --> 03:11:15,013
[SPEAKER_13]: And for example, some people who have certain disorders don't consider it to be a mental illness.

2456
03:11:15,053 --> 03:11:17,914
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, yeah, I may be autistic.

2457
03:11:17,974 --> 03:11:19,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't consider myself mentally ill.

2458
03:11:20,615 --> 03:11:28,859
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I had... Well, in a way, and just to kind of, you know, because like people get sick, not mental illness, but physical illness.

2459
03:11:29,499 --> 03:11:33,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Is a person with diabetes necessarily consider themselves sick?

2460
03:11:34,953 --> 03:11:36,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're managing, you know what I mean?

2461
03:11:36,674 --> 03:11:38,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of what happened, right?

2462
03:11:39,434 --> 03:11:46,876
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a difference because, well, I mean, the better comparison... And I'm not belittling diabetes by any means.

2463
03:11:46,896 --> 03:11:48,537
[SPEAKER_04]: My grandma had it and suffered from it and so forth.

2464
03:11:48,557 --> 03:11:57,519
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying, you start to kind of, you know, treat it and it doesn't... You conduct your day-to-day life managing it.

2465
03:11:57,619 --> 03:11:59,000
[SPEAKER_13]: The difference would be in...

2466
03:12:00,740 --> 03:12:01,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Outro Music

2467
03:12:16,025 --> 03:12:40,319
[SPEAKER_13]: um that being said I think what they're not also considering is that some of these people who have gone back um were uh had much more severe forms of socio uh disorders had there wasn't one of them actually diagnosed schizophrenic which means they hallucinate schizophrenic is not multiple personality disorder there are two different things

2468
03:12:40,899 --> 03:12:45,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people have complete reactions based on trauma.

2469
03:12:46,004 --> 03:13:00,119
[SPEAKER_13]: I know people with PTSD, and I'm talking about the post-war variety, who a car backfires and they're running for cover.

2470
03:13:00,500 --> 03:13:02,081
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the type of person I would not want with a gun.

2471
03:13:02,842 --> 03:13:03,342
[SPEAKER_13]: for example.

2472
03:13:03,862 --> 03:13:10,904
[SPEAKER_13]: That's somebody who I wouldn't want to have access to weapons because I've seen that instant look for panic, look for defense.

2473
03:13:11,904 --> 03:13:13,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes there is that.

2474
03:13:13,465 --> 03:13:28,869
[SPEAKER_04]: But the average person dealing with depression or dealing with... I just want to be careful with the broad generalizations because you also would not be the one to say who shouldn't... A professional does this, not you.

2475
03:13:28,909 --> 03:13:29,969
[SPEAKER_13]: But my point was...

2476
03:13:30,489 --> 03:13:32,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick, Regineer, sorry, I'll let her finish and Regineer will get back to you.

2477
03:13:32,831 --> 03:13:49,900
[SPEAKER_13]: My point on that was saying that if a person is going to have a tendency to go into a defensive mode or to go into some sort of memory regression, you want to watch, but you don't know who everybody is.

2478
03:13:50,300 --> 03:13:51,941
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why there has to be better screening.

2479
03:13:53,123 --> 03:13:54,183
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my point, sorry.

2480
03:13:54,404 --> 03:13:54,944
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no worries.

2481
03:13:55,004 --> 03:13:57,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator, go ahead and get your thought out and then I have a question for you.

2482
03:13:57,825 --> 03:14:17,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one thing to consider is that regardless of what diagnosis that someone has, be it PTSD or schizophrenia or this, that, or the other, some questions that should be asked is, are they in some form of treatment?

2483
03:14:17,714 --> 03:14:18,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they

2484
03:14:18,547 --> 03:14:43,190
[SPEAKER_01]: seeking one-on-one counseling, are they seeing psychiatrists getting medications, are they taking their medications as prescribed, you know, and they're usually taking this pill or this pill at the right, you know, levels, you know, dosages every day consistently at the right time, so on and so forth, and I mean, you know,

2485
03:14:43,900 --> 03:15:00,610
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not seeking treatments, not taking their medications as prescribed, if they're abusing street drugs or alcohol, then yeah, their behavior is going to get far, far worse.

2486
03:15:00,931 --> 03:15:12,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, if you also, one thing to consider is, on top of that, more often than not, the mentally ill

2487
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:18,401
[SPEAKER_01]: is the victim of crimes relative to the perpetrator.

2488
03:15:22,642 --> 03:15:41,367
[SPEAKER_01]: If, let's say, hypothetically speaking, I don't know Sacramento at all, so I don't know what areas of town, or the good sides of town, where the homeless tend to be, so on and so forth, but if you can think of what area that

2489
03:15:42,708 --> 03:16:08,557
[SPEAKER_01]: the homeless and the mentally ill tend to congregate and you happen to be on the street after no good chances are you're going to probably if you want an easy mark you're going to probably go after the people that won't put up much of a fight which probably will be the mentally ill you know so once they're very well you'll hear about

2490
03:16:09,150 --> 03:16:15,336
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy with schizophrenia that pushed some woman off of a training platform and that woman gets killed.

2491
03:16:15,436 --> 03:16:19,380
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're the exception to the rule, not the rule itself.

2492
03:16:20,881 --> 03:16:32,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And chances are, they're that person that didn't take their medication or was doing alcohol or drugs a few hours earlier.

2493
03:16:33,573 --> 03:16:35,595
[SPEAKER_01]: or multiple whatever, so.

2494
03:16:55,715 --> 03:17:00,038
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think, Ragenator, maybe you don't have an answer for this, but I want to try and ask it anyway.

2495
03:17:00,558 --> 03:17:03,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator, how do you think video games help you?

2496
03:17:05,302 --> 03:17:24,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the times that I'm stressed out or depressed, let's say I'm feeling a severe depression symptoms or there's some kind of stimulus outside that's really agitating me,

2497
03:17:24,941 --> 03:17:25,681
[SPEAKER_01]: one way or another.

2498
03:17:28,822 --> 03:17:39,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I use video games as my primary coping mechanism to deal with the symptoms.

2499
03:17:41,446 --> 03:17:49,969
[SPEAKER_01]: At least prior to my PS3 being stolen, I would either play Flower or Super Stardust HD.

2500
03:17:52,037 --> 03:17:54,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, obviously, Flower is a very relaxing game.

2501
03:17:56,398 --> 03:18:14,343
[SPEAKER_01]: But, regardless of the game, I'll focus in on that game for a while, and for all intents and purposes, while I'm playing that game, the rest of the world and my own thoughts don't exist.

2502
03:18:15,004 --> 03:18:20,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just focusing on completing the level, beating the level, beating the AI, doing whatever.

2503
03:18:21,449 --> 03:18:27,910
[SPEAKER_01]: and after a while, things go back to normal and I use air quotes.

2504
03:18:29,371 --> 03:18:31,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, normal for me, you know.

2505
03:18:31,611 --> 03:18:32,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, sure.

2506
03:18:33,671 --> 03:18:48,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, once in a great while that doesn't work 100% of the time, once in a great while it's so bad that I do need to be hospitalized, case in point, February 3rd,

2507
03:18:48,764 --> 03:18:49,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to hear that.

2508
03:19:10,447 --> 03:19:15,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you for sharing some very deeply personal stuff with us.

2509
03:19:16,193 --> 03:19:16,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, no problem.

2510
03:19:32,751 --> 03:19:33,652
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2511
03:19:54,046 --> 03:19:59,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Walk a mile in somebody else's shoes because at least at the end of the day, if nothing else, you have their shoes.

2512
03:19:59,608 --> 03:20:01,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You have their shoes and you're a mile away.

2513
03:20:01,749 --> 03:20:02,009
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2514
03:20:02,730 --> 03:20:07,452
[SPEAKER_13]: But that was, you know, thank you for giving some incentive for education as well.

2515
03:20:07,652 --> 03:20:08,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

2516
03:20:08,192 --> 03:20:08,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, no problem.

2517
03:20:09,012 --> 03:20:09,793
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Ragenator.

2518
03:20:10,013 --> 03:20:12,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to end it up and end up the show.

2519
03:20:12,674 --> 03:20:12,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2520
03:20:13,074 --> 03:20:13,634
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you, buddy.

2521
03:20:13,834 --> 03:20:14,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

2522
03:20:14,415 --> 03:20:15,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, no problem.

2523
03:20:15,135 --> 03:20:15,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a nice night.

2524
03:20:15,995 --> 03:20:16,455
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you too.

2525
03:20:17,256 --> 03:20:19,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Props to Ragenator, says ActF in our chat room.

2526
03:20:19,737 --> 03:20:20,157
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

2527
03:20:20,857 --> 03:20:21,217
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2528
03:20:22,538 --> 03:20:22,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Whew.

2529
03:20:24,113 --> 03:20:25,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And to think, I almost didn't take that call.

2530
03:20:26,395 --> 03:20:28,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we were on our way out of here.

2531
03:20:28,517 --> 03:20:29,818
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we are definitely on our way out of here.

2532
03:20:29,838 --> 03:20:31,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Your fingers were hovering over the Alt-F4 just by time.

2533
03:20:31,620 --> 03:20:32,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I was like, am I going to take it?

2534
03:20:32,981 --> 03:20:33,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I going to take it?

2535
03:20:33,482 --> 03:20:34,483
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to take it.

2536
03:20:34,923 --> 03:20:37,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a really, really insightful call.

2537
03:20:37,606 --> 03:20:38,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavy stuff on tonight's show.

2538
03:20:38,767 --> 03:20:41,590
[SPEAKER_04]: My God, we covered a lot of good stuff tonight.

2539
03:20:41,690 --> 03:20:42,831
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a damn good show.

2540
03:20:42,911 --> 03:20:44,432
[SPEAKER_04]: This was one for the Emmys.

2541
03:20:44,793 --> 03:20:48,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they give Emmys to podcasts, but if they did, I'd be submitting this one.

2542
03:20:48,716 --> 03:20:50,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one last fun, silly thing.

2543
03:20:50,957 --> 03:20:51,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good, good, please.

2544
03:20:52,058 --> 03:20:54,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anybody ever actually made it to the bottom of the Steam sale page?

2545
03:20:55,099 --> 03:20:55,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2546
03:20:55,659 --> 03:20:57,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've seen the fact that it's upside down?

2547
03:20:57,160 --> 03:20:57,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2548
03:20:57,440 --> 03:20:58,881
[SPEAKER_05]: You notice the fact that it says spring?

2549
03:20:59,241 --> 03:20:59,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, no, I did.

2550
03:20:59,901 --> 03:21:00,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of autumn.

2551
03:21:00,962 --> 03:21:05,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you actually use that navigation, your experience will be temporarily upside down as well.

2552
03:21:05,784 --> 03:21:06,884
[SPEAKER_05]: On some pages, not all.

2553
03:21:07,325 --> 03:21:14,148
[SPEAKER_05]: You go all the way to the bottom, you hit featured items, you get the featured item pages where autumn is on bottom and everything is upside down.

2554
03:21:14,188 --> 03:21:16,549
[SPEAKER_05]: You scroll to the top, spring sale is oriented right side up.

2555
03:21:16,869 --> 03:21:18,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredibly silly, but hilarious.

2556
03:21:19,490 --> 03:21:21,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And I figure most people just scroll down until they see a game.

2557
03:21:22,472 --> 03:21:27,395
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as the game stops being listed by... Click the button, didn't get a Steam card, didn't care.

2558
03:21:28,395 --> 03:21:28,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2559
03:21:29,056 --> 03:21:29,336
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2560
03:21:30,076 --> 03:21:34,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and then for Australia, since they're all upside down and it's spring there, that's...

2561
03:21:35,379 --> 03:21:35,819
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a joke.

2562
03:21:35,899 --> 03:21:36,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a joke, people.

2563
03:21:37,220 --> 03:21:48,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Our chat system at work, we have a plug-in for it, so anybody that's even visiting, anybody that's located as in the southern hemisphere, we rotate their avatars upside down.

2564
03:21:48,867 --> 03:21:49,488
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.

2565
03:21:49,508 --> 03:21:50,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

2566
03:21:50,528 --> 03:21:51,489
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the Aussies plug-in.

2567
03:21:51,889 --> 03:21:52,229
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2568
03:21:53,290 --> 03:21:56,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, since you do have the mic, I want to thank you for being here on the show yet again.

2569
03:21:56,332 --> 03:21:56,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.

2570
03:21:56,913 --> 03:22:01,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're going to be a familiar face while you're in town over the next month, but it's great to have you here.

2571
03:22:01,676 --> 03:22:06,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I'll ask you if you have any final thoughts before we see you next week.

2572
03:22:09,422 --> 03:22:13,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be continuing to say this because we're not even here yet, but have a mighty fine holiday season.

2573
03:22:13,965 --> 03:22:17,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it already started, if you think about it, with the Thanksgiving already.

2574
03:22:17,528 --> 03:22:17,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

2575
03:22:18,340 --> 03:22:24,903
[SPEAKER_05]: and schools are going to start letting out real fast here and new systems and all the fancy, exciting hullabaloo.

2576
03:22:26,544 --> 03:22:27,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2577
03:22:28,665 --> 03:22:33,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're giving away some codes for Ms.

2578
03:22:33,648 --> 03:22:37,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Explosion Man and the Maw and Aqua and stuff at McDonald's.

2579
03:22:38,310 --> 03:22:38,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

2580
03:22:39,111 --> 03:22:41,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of a promotion with Xbox One and stuff.

2581
03:22:41,932 --> 03:22:43,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicken McNuggets all week long.

2582
03:22:43,533 --> 03:22:44,813
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why you're bad.

2583
03:22:46,014 --> 03:22:47,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when Taco Bell was giving away the PS4s.

2584
03:22:48,568 --> 03:22:50,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I did like... Oh, never mind.

2585
03:22:51,832 --> 03:22:53,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a couple final thoughts here real quick.

2586
03:22:54,295 --> 03:23:01,783
[SPEAKER_04]: One, it looks like some of you chatters are having a spirited debate right now, so don't forget, like Ranma and I were talking about earlier, go have a drink at the end of the day.

2587
03:23:02,484 --> 03:23:02,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you will.

2588
03:23:03,765 --> 03:23:22,713
[SPEAKER_04]: and then my other final thought is I neglected to plug this earlier in the show because I was trying to speed along with everything else but I do want to mention it's kind of an additional housekeeping thing and I'll remind you guys at the top of the show next week there is a new raffle at vognetwork.com and if you would like to enter to win a $20 gift card

2589
03:23:24,113 --> 03:23:30,134
[SPEAKER_04]: for your choice, either Xbox Live, Nintendo Network, Steam, PlayStation Network, or iTunes.

2590
03:23:30,194 --> 03:23:30,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those are the five.

2591
03:23:30,975 --> 03:23:31,755
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to win your choice.

2592
03:23:32,315 --> 03:23:34,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out all the details, vognetwork.com slash raffle.

2593
03:23:34,796 --> 03:23:35,976
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do, participate.

2594
03:23:36,036 --> 03:23:39,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And by listening to OLR, you've participated and have a chance to win.

2595
03:23:39,397 --> 03:23:44,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that all out, and congratulations to Fifth Dream, who won the very first VOG Network raffle.

2596
03:23:44,258 --> 03:23:47,559
[SPEAKER_04]: We gave away cards against humanity, and he got it.

2597
03:23:48,099 --> 03:23:48,799
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good job.

2598
03:23:49,219 --> 03:23:51,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the single game or the big box?

2599
03:23:51,499 --> 03:23:53,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the big, but the starter set thing

2600
03:23:53,800 --> 03:23:54,621
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2601
03:24:11,906 --> 03:24:13,766
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna be just like Gina Davis.

2602
03:24:14,707 --> 03:24:17,387
[SPEAKER_04]: She was that actress from Thelma and Louise who ended up taking a bar tree.

2603
03:24:18,447 --> 03:24:20,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2604
03:24:20,588 --> 03:24:22,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a hunting bow that I'd like to learn how to shoot.

2605
03:24:22,848 --> 03:24:24,969
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be like Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games.

2606
03:24:25,429 --> 03:24:27,829
[SPEAKER_03]: That movie was so fucking long.

2607
03:24:27,989 --> 03:24:31,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like so long.

2608
03:24:31,130 --> 03:24:33,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm shocked that that wasn't the first thing you said.

2609
03:24:33,891 --> 03:24:34,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

2610
03:24:34,591 --> 03:24:35,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to borrow your books.

2611
03:24:36,524 --> 03:24:41,882
[SPEAKER_04]: they're on a Kindle unfortunately but maybe if you ask Alan really nicely about your eyelashes he'll let you borrow it for a week so you can read them

2612
03:24:43,630 --> 03:24:46,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I just will put it on my table then.

2613
03:24:46,171 --> 03:24:47,171
[SPEAKER_13]: I like physical books.

2614
03:24:48,112 --> 03:24:49,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

2615
03:24:50,033 --> 03:24:56,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, because I always like to say this is the end of the show, I really want to thank you guys for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and participating with the show this week.

2616
03:24:56,596 --> 03:25:04,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you were here live at vognetword.com or you listened on the podcast feed or Stitcher or YouTube or whatever, we just want to thank you for sticking with it all the way to the end of the show.

2617
03:25:04,901 --> 03:25:08,363
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some tough topics tonight and a lot of variety of stuff and here you are.

2618
03:25:08,403 --> 03:25:09,523
[SPEAKER_04]: You made it all the way through the show.

2619
03:25:09,563 --> 03:25:10,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate your support.

2620
03:25:11,718 --> 03:25:17,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I loved the chat room by the way because I love intelligent debate and oh my god they were giving it to me and I never get that from my mother.

2621
03:25:19,914 --> 03:25:21,475
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like you're about ready to smoke a cigarette.

2622
03:25:21,615 --> 03:25:22,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good debate.

2623
03:25:23,457 --> 03:25:24,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I'm endorsing smoking.

2624
03:25:24,777 --> 03:25:29,320
[SPEAKER_13]: For the record, I find mental stimulation a lot more encouraging.

2625
03:25:29,541 --> 03:25:33,303
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot more of a turn-on than... Well, alrighty then.

2626
03:25:33,343 --> 03:25:34,083
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean.

2627
03:25:34,964 --> 03:25:37,446
[SPEAKER_13]: I find it to be a lot more satisfying than other things.

2628
03:25:37,646 --> 03:25:44,270
[SPEAKER_04]: If you found yourself stimulated by tonight's Orange Lounge Radio, then we want to invite you guys to please spread the word about the show.

2629
03:25:45,931 --> 03:25:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you laughing about over there?

2630
03:25:47,652 --> 03:25:59,357
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, not to waste the segue, but the tonal aspect of doing that, carrying it over from what was going on to your normal outro was phenomenal.

2631
03:25:59,417 --> 03:25:59,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally.

2632
03:25:59,877 --> 03:26:01,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very good, and then I broke it.

2633
03:26:01,458 --> 03:26:02,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I pat myself on the back.

2634
03:26:02,378 --> 03:26:03,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, sir.

2635
03:26:04,119 --> 03:26:05,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, okay.

2636
03:26:05,580 --> 03:26:05,901
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2637
03:26:05,921 --> 03:26:06,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on out of here.

2638
03:26:07,182 --> 03:26:09,664
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like the show, please tell a friend or five about the show.

2639
03:26:09,724 --> 03:26:10,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us spread the word.

2640
03:26:10,685 --> 03:26:12,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice reviews on iTunes, Stitcher Radio.

2641
03:26:13,127 --> 03:26:14,908
[SPEAKER_04]: They go a very long way and we really appreciate it.

2642
03:26:15,209 --> 03:26:18,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy whatever you want-ica over the next few weeks.

2643
03:26:18,952 --> 03:26:20,193
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing to say is hug Semiak.

2644
03:26:21,074 --> 03:26:21,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2645
03:26:21,834 --> 03:26:22,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2646
03:26:22,215 --> 03:26:22,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2647
03:26:23,216 --> 03:26:24,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy Hanukkah.

2648
03:26:24,437 --> 03:26:25,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever it is you want to celebrate.

2649
03:26:25,838 --> 03:26:26,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

2650
03:26:26,418 --> 03:26:27,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Fifth night tonight.

2651
03:26:27,659 --> 03:26:28,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

2652
03:26:28,720 --> 03:26:29,541
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next week.

2653
03:26:31,223 --> 03:26:31,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2654
03:26:32,950 --> 03:26:33,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching.

2655
03:27:02,342 --> 03:27:03,663
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next week.
