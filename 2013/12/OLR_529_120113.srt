We're officially on the road to the holiday season and the lovable 3rd Street Saints are joining in the festivities with new DLC.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I just said that.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I know you did and I'm saying it again. Live on this December 1st, 2013, episode number 529.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Welcome to the show. We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gamer lulls, and who knows what else with my co-hosts, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Does that mean he said it dead and now he's undead?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He said it out of turn is what he said. Fired!

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's fine. Alright.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Blah.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
DarkSakura, we missed you last week. Welcome back.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I wish I was here last week because it was fucking loud.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We went to this place called the Yard House which we were discussing before.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Not like super fancy pants but a little fancy.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I ate something incredibly non-kosher and it was delicious.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It was a surf and turf burger without the bun.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well then happy Hanukkah, Jamie.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Happy Hanukkah to me!

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It is the fifth night. I will be lighting my candles when I return home.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How did Hanukkah's giving, Hanukkah's giving or whatever?

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thanksgivica.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thanksgivica, yeah. So how did Thanksgivica treat you?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was fucking loud too.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, well we went to have Thanksgiving dinner at, you remember Dan's buddy Adam, right?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We went over there and there were the kids and Dan's cousins and brought the kids too and there was a bunch of little people and fucking sports ball.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I hate sports ball.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I hate sports ball.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Unless it's DVR.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And I say it with extra, extra southern accent because all I heard about yesterday was Alabama Auburn, no one cur.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But you do love Tecmo Bowl, right?

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, I guess.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I thought there was some, there's some sports ball you can tolerate, I know that.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, some.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I used to date a rugby player and that was pretty awesome.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Alright, also say hello as well to, Loki is here in studio.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hi.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How you doing Techmaster Loki?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Doing fine.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah?

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm trying to figure out where these phantom stain spots came from.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It looks like something dripped on my hand.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Pizza sauce.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's not pizza sauce.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's grease.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well it must be for the breadsticks but they're not that greasy.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I mean they are greasy but they're not that greasy.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Like I didn't notice any grease dripping off of them.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So one of Loki's, you know Loki always brings an interesting dining selection to the show and you know it's sometimes fast.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's become a bit of a betting game amongst the live OLR listeners what he brings to the show.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So tonight he brought his, he goes to the pizza place, he doesn't get pizza he gets just a mass of breadsticks.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They are really good breadsticks so I will say.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you have round table pizza in your area and you've had the breadsticks they are really good.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not gonna lie.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But yeah it's probably oil or something.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Anyway.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's cheese.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Cheese or something.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's cheesy.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It keeps Loki cheesy y'all.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Alright.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's not easy.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's being cheesy.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know you heard him a minute ago and he is back this week.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Say hello to the voice of the show.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Jason.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's me.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Again.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yet again.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah how you doing Jason?

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Doing good.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah?

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Been a good couple of days.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Been a good four day weekend.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Did you have a good Thanksgiving as well?

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I did Friendsgiving.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Co-workers of mine invited me over and there was about 20 of us.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Anybody that follows me on Twitter may have seen this story that I started to come up with.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
A Twitter, Apple, Google, and GitHub employee sat around the table and I don't really have

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
a joke to fill in to the end of that but I'm sure there's one in there somewhere.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Some Silicon Valley wag.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Friendsgiving is a lot of fun.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Friendsgiving is very good.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah it was a good time.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I had kind of a late Friends- well not- you know what I did last night?

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I went and saw a grandpa from Hoard House.

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you know my other show Hoard House that I do about all things sound like gaming but

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
never too seriously Wednesdays.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I went and hung out with grandpa last night in what I think is becoming a bit of a post-Thanksgiving

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
tradition for us where we go, we visit, and then we go out and drink.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So I'm-

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I heard you.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Got super drunk.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm a little- well you must read my Twitter because I wrote some really stupid stuff last

101
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
night while I-

102
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
No, no, no, no.

103
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Grandpa posted it on Facebook.

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay, well you know me and my alcohol tolerance of which I have none, right?

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because I usually don't drink.

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,700
I'm usually the sober one but visiting grandpa in the city we were able to take cabs and

107
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,200
all that stuff.

108
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,500
I had seven drinks last night.

109
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,220
And yeah, it was a lot of fun.

110
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
I'm good.

111
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,220
I'm good.

112
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,000
But I am feeling a little bit like if I'm dragging a little bit today, I blame that.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,500
I blame Friendsgiving with drinks.

114
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Good times.

115
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
All right.

116
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Is that the new Zynga game?

117
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Friendsgiving with drinks?

118
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Possibly.

119
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Possibly.

120
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
All right.

121
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
We have a busy show tonight.

122
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,820
We have a lot of news to get into as well.

123
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,140
Also joining us a little later on in the show in about 20 minutes, the founder of a convention

124
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,180
I talked a lot about here on Orange Launch Radio because I went and I helped out with

125
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,420
a panel there, GamerX.

126
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,140
Matt Kahn is the founder of GamerX and he is actually going to be on the show tonight

127
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,260
in about 20 minutes to talk about a new Kickstarter that actually has nothing to do with conventions

128
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,700
but it is kind of neat because it's inspired by an old, you know, we love old classic video

129
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,300
games here at OLR.

130
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,940
How many, show of hands, who remembers the old video game Snatcher?

131
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,940
Yep.

132
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,500
Almost every hand in the room went up.

133
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,060
Who has Snatcher?

134
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:36,860
Well, Matt's latest Kickstarter for his company MidBoss Games is a game that's about a futuristic

135
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,780
San Francisco that is heavily inspired by Snatcher.

136
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,940
So he's going to come on, talk a little bit about that and of course, if he's going to

137
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,980
be, I have to ask him about GamerX.

138
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,620
I want to know about GamerX too.

139
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,500
So we got to ask some of those questions.

140
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,760
So we will get to those questions and your questions live in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

141
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,060
in about 20 minutes or so.

142
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,580
But first, we're going to get to gaming weeks and all that, but I do want to get to a kickoff

143
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,620
topic as well.

144
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,940
This one's a little bit more of a serious note.

145
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,200
This is housekeeping of sorts, IDK, what you want to call it, but we got to talk a little

146
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,700
bit about last week.

147
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,060
I thought we had a great show last week.

148
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,660
We had a lot of fun here on the show last week.

149
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,660
Even though you weren't here.

150
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,660
I wasn't here.

151
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
How could it be awesome?

152
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Well, it wasn't our best ever.

153
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,660
I'll be honest.

154
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,660
Dark Soccer.

155
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
It could have been our best.

156
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,820
You need me to balance it out, huh?

157
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,820
But we did know.

158
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,020
We did get feedback from multiple sources on last week's show that maybe felt that some

159
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,340
of the discussion we had last week might have been a little bit off.

160
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,420
And so it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

161
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,900
So I want to entertain some of this feedback and I want to kind of respond to it a little

162
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,380
bit respectfully.

163
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,700
I'm going to call this one out because it was publicly posted to our Facebook.

164
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,860
And by calling out, I just mean I'm selecting it to read it on there.

165
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,740
Not like, I'm calling you out, black racks, three o'clock.

166
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
No.

167
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,740
Because I do appreciate the feedback.

168
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
It's a show where every gamer has a voice.

169
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,500
So I want to read this post that came to our Facebook.

170
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,880
It's from Carla O is the name on Facebook.

171
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,620
And it says, I think I might stop listening to the show if it becomes PlayStation centric,

172
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,940
which it's starting to seem that way.

173
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,420
And that was the comment.

174
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:12,940
I was really trying to think like, what in last week's show might have given the impression

175
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,220
that we were PlayStation centric?

176
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,560
And I was really thinking about it and I was like, you know what?

177
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,660
In gaming culture as of late anyway, things have definitely seemed to be tilting in PlayStation

178
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,660
's favor as a whole.

179
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,820
And I'm like, I'm looking at the big picture here and I'm trying to think, why is that?

180
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,540
Well, that's because Microsoft has been playing a little bit of a game of catch up PR, fixed

181
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,860
mistakes ever since E3, right?

182
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,140
And obviously they launched the Xbox one.

183
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,100
We kicked off last week's show.

184
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,980
Loki had some choice words for the Xbox one.

185
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,100
I felt what Loki was saying and even kind of listening back to it.

186
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,120
I didn't think it was anything that I haven't like seen in other internet places.

187
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,640
I think their voices I'm hearing other places, you know, again, every gamer has a voice.

188
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,480
These are what some gamer voices are saying.

189
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,720
Not everything out there is positive, but I was trying to think, does that, was that

190
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,480
really making us PlayStation centric?

191
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
I'm not sure.

192
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
So I did respond.

193
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,800
Nobody am on Sony's payroll now.

194
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Stop.

195
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
No, you're not.

196
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
All right.

197
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
But I did respond and I gave an answer basically similar to what I'm telling you guys now.

198
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,420
We try to treat everything fairly.

199
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,560
And one thing I did point out, as I said, I know you probably haven't been listening

200
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,600
to this show, but if you go back to like 2006.

201
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,320
And this is definitely a way I kind of feel in general.

202
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,280
If we go back to 2006, the roles were almost reversed.

203
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,600
I mean, coming out of E3 that year, Sony was the laughing stock of the entire gaming industry.

204
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,760
Giant enemy crabs, 599 US dollars, 599, like we all remember that, right?

205
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,440
And I know I've made this comparison on the show before is that we're almost sitting in

206
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,580
a place now where we're looking at like the complete flip of that.

207
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,480
Microsoft had one of those E3s this year that they've been trying to recover from and

208
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
PlayStation.

209
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,920
You know, we had something very interesting happen at E3 this year.

210
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,320
Let's think back, you guys.

211
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,080
This is something we have not seen in a long time in this industry, ever since the ads

212
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,120
in the magazines that say Sega does what Nintendo don't.

213
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,120
We did not see something of the caliber of Jack Trenton getting up on stage and saying,

214
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,960
we believe that gamers should be able to, sorry, I forget his direct quote, but we believe

215
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,720
the gamers should be able to, once they buy the disc, the purchase is there.

216
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,160
Once he did that systematic dismantling at E3 of everything the internet didn't like

217
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
about Microsoft.

218
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,920
And so that was an attack we haven't seen the likes of in a long time.

219
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,340
So that made things very interesting.

220
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
But anyway.

221
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,340
We don't even have to go back that far.

222
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,040
We just have to go back two weeks ago where you canceled your PS4 pre-order.

223
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,540
True.

224
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,080
But I don't necessarily blame Sony for that.

225
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,240
I just necessarily blame it.

226
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,520
And I think this is the boat we're all in right now of, we're just not ready for this

227
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,960
next generation of game yet.

228
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,000
And it goes back to the golden rule of gaming.

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

230
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
And for me personally, I look at what the PlayStation 4 has and at what the Xbox One

231
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,960
has and I say, eh, nothing there for me yet.

232
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,080
Well, Dan and I swore off system and phone launches.

233
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,960
You know, I'm getting my 5S at the end of the year instead of, you know, right when

234
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,500
it came out, we're getting our, probably getting our PS4 in February.

235
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,800
And we've pretty much decided that just because more stuff that we want to do is out on it

236
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
and it fits in better with the things that we want to do.

237
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
End of story.

238
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Right.

239
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
To tell you what train that I'm on.

240
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,680
I'm on the Turbo Duo train, 16 bit forever, HuCards, heck yeah.

241
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,720
So anyway, I wrote kind of a response along those lines.

242
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,800
Karla wrote back and I do want to read this here.

243
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,660
It says, but most of the negative criticism is focused on two out of those consoles.

244
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,180
I can understand everyone has their favorite console, but if the show focuses on all gaming

245
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,140
platforms, it should reflect that in the show content.

246
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,660
Lately there has been a ton of negativity thrown at one console and that is pretty much

247
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,300
what I hear in every other podcast.

248
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,520
OLR was the exception, but not as of late, which makes me sad because I enjoy this show

249
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
more than most.

250
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Thanks for the reply.

251
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
And you know what?

252
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,060
Thank you for engaging in respectful dialogue.

253
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,080
I really love these types of conversations as opposed to what you used to see in the

254
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,740
old YouTube comments.

255
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,200
Fuck you, you fucking fuck, right?

256
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,420
So I really appreciate kind of the respectful dialogue there.

257
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,020
As far as it goes, I can see where maybe last week, maybe kicking the Xbox the day after

258
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:27,400
they launched maybe wasn't the most tactful thing to do, but it's also kind of a realist

259
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,880
view of where some people's heads are at.

260
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,160
And I say this in general, and I'm going to come back to this theme a little bit later

261
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
on tonight.

262
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,460
I do like to think that we are fair to everybody.

263
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,440
There's going to be good days for gaming companies.

264
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,700
There's going to be bad days for gaming companies.

265
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,660
And we're part of that voice out there on the internet that talks about that.

266
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,020
And you know, just like, let's take Nintendo for an example.

267
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
We've talked a lot of Sony.

268
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,020
We've talked a lot of Microsoft.

269
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
We haven't talked a lot of Nintendo.

270
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,300
Nintendo absolutely has had their good days and their bad days.

271
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,820
And we've talked about, you know, we try to razz them both on this show.

272
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,260
For example, bad days, the swap note disabling, what?

273
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,620
That was, you know, and that, that just feeds into the whole Nintendo.

274
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,140
You do not understand online, that whole thing, right?

275
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,300
But then on the good side of Nintendo, dude, Nintendo released two game of the year contenders

276
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,980
on the same day in the new Mario 3D world and Zelda link between worlds.

277
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
That's a very good thing.

278
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,460
I mean, those are game of the year contenders.

279
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,900
Granted, it's going to be a rough ride to the top when you've got Bioshock Infinite

280
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,060
and Last of Us also this year, but let's not neglect that those are two rock solid games

281
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,380
that came out on the same day.

282
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
That's good news.

283
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,020
So, you know, and I could, I could think of cases for Sony and Microsoft as well.

284
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,180
I do want to encourage the listeners, you know, continue to, if you feel like your voice

285
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,220
is not being represented, by all means, speak up.

286
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,560
We want to hear where you're coming from.

287
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,620
If you think that, um, you know, maybe we're neglecting something about the Xbox one that

288
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,160
needs to be brought to the forelight, please bring it up on the show.

289
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,340
You know, I don't think we've ever said to somebody, you know what, you're wrong in your

290
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
opinion.

291
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,100
I like to think we haven't said that, you know, maybe, maybe we sometimes riff on each

292
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,260
other and yell at each other a little bit, maybe have said that, but we don't, you know,

293
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,300
we don't really want to tell people they're wrong.

294
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Right.

295
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Am I right?

296
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Oh yeah.

297
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,900
I've been meaning to talk to you about Mass Effect, but you're wrong.

298
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
You're wrong.

299
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
You're wrong.

300
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,900
You can't deny a fact.

301
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
You are wrong on.

302
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
You cannot deny a fact.

303
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
All right.

304
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,860
But anyway, uh, I, I might be dragging this out way too much, but I just, I just want

305
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,000
to say, guys, again, we're here to present some other perspectives and sometimes that's

306
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,660
our perspective and sometimes that's your perspective.

307
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,420
And one thing I want to challenge our listeners to do, I don't think I got my thought out

308
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:42,940
on this, is that, you know, sometimes in gaming we tend to live in this bubble and it's the

309
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,740
way, the way you see it and the things, and I'm not saying this particular listener is

310
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
that way.

311
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,900
I'm not saying you, I'm just saying in general, gamers, gaming, look at comments on websites

312
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,020
and tell me you don't think this about some people.

313
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,160
Some gamers tend to live in their little bubble and they can't really see outside that bubble.

314
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,080
How could somebody possibly want an Xbox one?

315
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,000
How could somebody possibly want to spend a hundred extra dollars on this system with

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,760
this device you don't need and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, well, look outside that

317
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
bubble.

318
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,080
Maybe there's a reason.

319
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
Maybe there's that game.

320
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,780
And I'll tell you for me personally, next year is going to suck for my wallet because

321
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm going to have to buckle and get a PlayStation 4 when they release Final Fantasy 14, the

322
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,400
Elder Scrolls beta, uh, the new infamous looks really good.

323
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,680
You know, there's a lot of stuff on PlayStation then on Xbox 360, guess what?

324
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,000
When they release a new halo, when they release quantum break, I got to pick up an, did I

325
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
say 360?

326
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm an Xbox one.

327
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,840
When they release all that, I got to get an Xbox one as well.

328
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,200
So my wallet's going to be hurting next year.

329
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm just waiting for those games.

330
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
All right.

331
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,340
Um, I do want to introduce our chat room live.vognetwork.com, uh, because we do tape live, of course, every

332
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,840
Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network

333
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,400
www.vognetwork.com.

334
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,680
And I'm trying to look at, uh, what some of the chatters are saying here.

335
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,520
We've been discussing physics.

336
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,080
So on, on task, apparently I'm, I'm seeing you talk about gigantic monitors and whatever

337
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,400
is going on there, because I said that I should be on NEC's payroll and someone asked if they

338
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
still exist.

339
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,480
And then we started talking about their printers and stuff, right?

340
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,400
But they, they made like these great flat panel, not flat panel, but flat screen CRT

341
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,040
monitors that were perfect for doing color matching.

342
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,240
I mean, it was almost like a print match.

343
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
It was so great.

344
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,120
And of course you can't really get a CRT monitor anymore.

345
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,600
Um, let's see.

346
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
S2 100.

347
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,720
Matt says, I remember the beginning of last generation, OLR was accused of being anti

348
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Sony.

349
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,440
Well, a lot of internet was, uh, Brad says, uh, talk about what you know, we bought the

350
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,420
PlayStation four versus the Xbox one.

351
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,520
So that is what we can talk about.

352
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
And you're right.

353
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,640
We can talk about our particular reasons and so forth.

354
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,680
And then let's see some folks in chat, uh, some various people talking about kind of

355
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,720
the whole Microsoft and what happened recently with some of the bands they were doing, which

356
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,960
we're going to get into a little later in the show.

357
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,480
Um, Loki, I, I, you know, again, you don't have to apologize by any means for what you

358
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,520
said last week, because I got to admit, I think you brought up some points that, you

359
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,560
know, are worth thinking about and why there is some resistance to the Xbox one, but now

360
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,480
they've had a week to kind of simmer on it and black Friday going on and so forth.

361
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,720
Where's your head at now with generally PlayStation four and Xbox one and all of this, I gotta

362
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,320
say that sweet, sweet PlayStation four is a great value for this holiday at a retail

363
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,360
price of $399.

364
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
You can find it.

365
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Okay.

366
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,560
I just don't want to do that because I'm not on their payroll.

367
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,560
I really wish I was, you don't understand how much that would be so awesome to have

368
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,320
actual a, um, no, but, um, how do I see it?

369
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,760
My point last week was, and I guess it just didn't come through clearly enough, so I will

370
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,400
speak more clearly on it, um, that I thought Microsoft should have addressed the way their,

371
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,200
you know, defective systems were, um, differently.

372
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,160
And sure enough, a few days later, they finally came around and did it correctly.

373
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,880
Like I said, address the situation, resolve it with your customers, you know, instead

374
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,440
of letting them speculate about what the problem is or how wide of an issue it is and

375
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,560
stuff like that.

376
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,920
That was my issue.

377
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,280
They cleared it up.

378
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,640
So I'm, you want gaming companies to stop the smokescreen like, yeah, if you don't say

379
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
anything, people are going to expect the worst.

380
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,160
So that's kind of what it is.

381
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,320
You know that Microsoft did it at the beginning of the Xbox, you know, three 16 launch kept

382
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,760
playing down, you know, how many systems were affected by the red ring of death or whatever.

383
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,360
And, um, you know, and people didn't believe them.

384
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,360
Yeah.

385
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,360
I don't believe you that a small percentage of them are being affected by it when I've

386
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,360
had six, you know, it's just, it was ridiculous.

387
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,640
So I don't know, I think I'm a hard on everybody.

388
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,240
And if I'm not, then I need to try harder.

389
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
You are to be fair.

390
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
You are pretty hard on everybody.

391
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,880
Uh, when, when, you know, shut up.

392
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
But you know, I, it is kind of part of the reason I also see, you know, granted, we had

393
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,720
a lot of feedback to last week's show in that regard, but I also get other feedback.

394
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,740
That's like, I live for Loki rants.

395
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,360
I am here for Loki rants.

396
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,440
What pissed Loki off this week?

397
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,740
I've got to have a rant.

398
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,040
So, you know, there's, there's that on both sides.

399
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,520
There's been things, we'll, we'll see what we're going to get to tonight in tonight's

400
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
show.

401
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
But, um, again, I just wanted to respond.

402
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,200
And even though I only read one comment there, cause it was something public on Facebook.

403
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,520
I just wanted to say there was other like chatter.

404
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,480
So you know, I hope, you know, again, if you feel like there's a point that wasn't addressed,

405
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,240
please by all means, email the show mailbag at orange dontre.com.

406
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,360
You can post on Facebook as to, uh, Twitter and all that.

407
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,180
Um, let's get into quickly.

408
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,960
We're going to have Matt on in about 10 minutes.

409
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,960
So we have a little bit of time to do some of our gaming weeks, at least, uh, dark soccer.

410
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
You were out last week.

411
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,160
What have you been gaming on the past couple of weeks?

412
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,560
Uh, Final Fantasy 14, which every time I've logged on, no one's been on.

413
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
So whatever.

414
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,120
Um, and, uh, I really, cause I'm on a lot well, it's during the day and you people have

415
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
jobs.

416
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Yeah.

417
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
I started my job, my contract work.

418
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
So I'm very happy.

419
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,520
Um, yeah, I, uh, I bought, okay, actually, actually this is going to be a story, so maybe

420
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
this will take the 10 minutes.

421
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,960
Dan's birthday was Friday on black Friday and we were like last week we need to do something

422
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
really nice for Dan.

423
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,360
So I was trying to get people who wanted to get in to buy Dan a present with me and he

424
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,600
had said up and down, I don't want a download copy of Zelda.

425
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,320
I want the physical copy, so I'm not going to get the package, blah, blah, blah.

426
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:40,520
So me and Becky and our cousin-in-law Hannah and George and Amanda all got together and

427
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:47,240
we got the money together to order Dan a red, uh, 3DS XL and I bought him Zelda.

428
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I went out and bought it.

429
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,600
Turns out while I'm sitting in the bank trying to get my, my, uh, business bank account set

430
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,480
up so that, you know, it can work, Dan says, look what I bought, picture gold, you know,

431
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
3DS.

432
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,280
So I call him, I go, you are so stupid.

433
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,920
And this guy is like sitting next to me playing like bejeweled on his phone and he's laughing

434
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,960
his ass off because, and so anyway, it ended up, you know, they just gave the monies for

435
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,800
Dan to pay back what he paid on the thing and we kept the physical copy.

436
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,000
He gave the e-copy to George and maybe you were going to do something where you bought

437
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,480
the Zelda one and then like you sold the code to somebody else who really wanted it.

438
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,320
So I just kind of thought that's how things would go, but I, I liked the way you guys

439
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
did it.

440
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,240
And for the record bones, it actually was me because I was using Becky me in a subjective

441
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
content.

442
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Context.

443
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:44,760
So you never end with, you never use I as a subject.

444
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,640
I mean, as a, as a object, it is a grammar throwdown going on in our chat room anyway.

445
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,760
Don't you dare step to me in my grammar.

446
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,120
All right, moving on.

447
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Come on.

448
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
I will conjugate you to death.

449
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,600
Anyway, so, uh, as it turned out, George ended up picking up a Fire Emblem for Dan because

450
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:12,200
Dan loves his Fire Emblem and Dan's been playing, uh, um, uh, crap.

451
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I just forgot it.

452
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
Oh, uh, Ace Attorney.

453
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,320
He's been really into it and hasn't been sleeping because he's doing the damn cases.

454
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:28,480
Um, also, um, at any rate, uh, what I've been playing is since he beat Zelda in like four

455
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,920
days, I'm playing it now and I just finished, uh, the Eastern palace and I like a lot of

456
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,680
the throwbacks to the, um, link to the past.

457
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,640
It was, I pretty happy with it.

458
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,360
I think it was a worthy purchase and one that we're both enjoying.

459
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,640
So, uh, as far as other things, I'm playing, still playing the Stanley parable off and

460
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,240
on just so, you know, cause there's so many different endings for it, but I don't want

461
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
it to get stale.

462
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,800
So I'm playing it a bit at a time.

463
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:02,320
I bought a game called the Shiva, um, which is about a rabbi and it's, it's a kind of

464
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,560
a, a horror story from what it looks like or an investigative story.

465
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,140
So like a mystery.

466
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,100
So it looked interesting to me and it was cheap.

467
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,320
And then I bought, uh, some other game called 9.3 M or something.

468
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
I don't know.

469
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,800
It was cheap too.

470
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,820
And uh, I've just been trying to get through what's in my steam library and you know, I've

471
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,400
got a few more things on my list, so we'll see what happens.

472
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,880
But my goal is to play a different game every week.

473
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,240
That's in my steam library, library, my library.

474
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,640
That's that's a lofty goal because you know that, that those steam libraries build up

475
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
quick.

476
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,860
Well, I've got enough games to play a different game every week for the next 10 years.

477
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,860
So I think I'll be good.

478
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,860
I could do that easily for a year and a half, even just uninstalled alone right now.

479
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,100
I could do that for at least a year.

480
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:52,300
I can probably talk about, uh, my own steam library, but I made, I made a dent in the

481
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,860
backlog this week and I will get into that in just a little bit.

482
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,260
But dark soccer, if you are done with your gaming week, I am, then I think we're going

483
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,620
to go ahead and we're going to go over to the phones, uh, and we are going to get our

484
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,220
buddy Matt Kahn on the line.

485
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,540
Matt Kahn is the founder of GamerX and he is behind a new Kickstarter for Read Only

486
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,500
Memories, a new cyberpunk adventure.

487
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,020
So we're going to ask him about, you know, what's going on with GamerX and what's going

488
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,500
on with this new game and how awesome is Snatcher and so forth.

489
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,140
Uh, and I believe Matt is there.

490
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Matt, you on the line?

491
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
I am.

492
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
Hey, how are you guys doing?

493
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
I'm great.

494
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
Welcome to Orange Launch Radio, Matt.

495
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Great to have you here.

496
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,100
Yeah, I'm super excited to be on the show.

497
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,460
I really wanted to come on for a while, so.

498
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
Thank you.

499
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,860
Oh my gosh, we should have had you on last time you had a Kickstarter to promote because

500
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,580
I gave a lot of money to that Kickstarter and it was, it was, no, it was totally worth

501
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,580
it.

502
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,260
I had, and thank you for, for putting that together and I know you have a whole team

503
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,340
behind you and they all deserve kudos.

504
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,220
Uh, GamerX, I had a fantastic time at GamerX and that was a, that was a great experience

505
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,940
and um, yeah, I, I can't wait for GamerX too.

506
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
Awesome.

507
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,780
We're really excited to, uh, to have GamerX too happening, you know, like, uh, we, when

508
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,180
we didn't get, you know, the original GamerX, we weren't sure if there would be the, you

509
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,380
know, the outcry for a second one, but, uh, people seem to have a really good time, so

510
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,700
we're doing a second one and we're really excited about it.

511
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Awesome, awesome.

512
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,540
If you guys have questions for Matt, you can join our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, I

513
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,580
got some questions of my own here and I'm sure some of us here in studio also have questions

514
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,300
for him, but I will be throwing in some of your questions as well as we talk about, uh,

515
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,820
GamerX and, and your latest Kickstarter and so forth.

516
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,140
Um, let me ask you a couple of things about GamerX.

517
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,500
So, so there is a GamerX too, that is happening this year, right?

518
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Yep.

519
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,820
Or this next year, 2014, um, and I noticed one of the things I noticed right away, you're

520
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,180
like, the new venue is three times as big as the old one, right?

521
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
Yeah.

522
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,420
So, you know, uh, people seem to really like the con last year, um, but I think that, you

523
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:00,020
know, a lot of our, our, you know, um, first time kind of jitters showed off a little bit

524
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,220
in that, you know, we, we definitely overbooked the hotel.

525
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,860
Like, it was really crowded and, uh, we don't want people to feel, especially, you know,

526
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,580
with a, with a crowd like we have, like we don't want people to feel like it's a claustrophobic

527
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,220
or, you know, we want it to feel super comfortable and super homey.

528
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,620
And, uh, by going to the Intercontinental, uh, not only are we choosing a spot that's

529
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,900
really easy for people who live in the Bay Area to get to because it's right off BART

530
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,380
and all the major Muni lines, uh, but also it's, you know, it's so much bigger.

531
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,540
It's three times the size that, you know, even if we grow, you know, even double the

532
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,580
size of attendees, we'll have more than enough space to, uh, you know, make sure they're

533
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,820
all good and have a place to, you know, hang out and chill.

534
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,580
What would you say besides, uh, you know, cause, cause obviously this whole thing was,

535
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,900
was a real adventure for you from the Kickstarter to the execution and, you know, overall and

536
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,940
everything I heard about it was, you know, yeah, it was a little bit crowded, but you

537
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,740
know what, Oh, what a problem for a first year con to have that there's just too much

538
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
interest in it.

539
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
Right.

540
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,300
So, you know, most everything I was hearing was, it was really, really positive about

541
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,900
the convention and that's how I left, you know, pretty much feeling as well.

542
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,400
What would you say from this whole experience start to finish?

543
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,820
What was, what was the biggest lesson you learned that you could pass on to somebody

544
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,200
else who's thinking about maybe starting something of their own in their town or something for

545
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,680
whatever the cause is?

546
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,920
Um, you know, I think that, you know, we didn't, we, I don't know, because the thing that I,

547
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,960
I feel like I've learned the most is that, uh, you know, we went into gamer X or the

548
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,640
original one without having, you know, any real convention experience behind us.

549
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,280
And so we really overestimated the amount of, you know, major sponsors that were going

550
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
to come in.

551
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,400
And, uh, we spent a lot more money bringing in in terms of sponsorship.

552
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,800
Um, and so we were able to, you know, have a really awesome convention, but we spent

553
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,040
more money than we made, um, which is, you know, which is okay, but like when you're

554
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,720
running off of like, you know, we don't have any, any venture capitalists or anything,

555
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,600
um, you know, going into the red is kind of a scary thing.

556
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,560
Um, so I wish I had done better budgeting and also been a little bit more like, I think,

557
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,060
realistic with the fact that, uh, you know, because it was our first year, I think a lot

558
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,960
of companies were scared to kind of come on as, as, uh, as, um, sponsors.

559
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,640
And then also we got a lot of people who were just kind of like, they were too afraid to

560
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,400
kind of touch an LGBT thing, um, that it didn't really fit their brand.

561
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Interesting.

562
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Yeah.

563
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Hmm.

564
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,440
Well now, okay.

565
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,320
So unfortunately I know our own dark soccer did not get to go to gamer X neither did Loki.

566
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,560
Um, but dark soccer is trying to make it at least this year.

567
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
I'm hoping.

568
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
I hope so.

569
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
You got it.

570
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
You got to come do a panel with me.

571
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
I had a ton of fun.

572
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,760
Uh, but, uh, our buddy here in studio, Jason actually went to gamer X and you are a straight

573
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,880
male who went to gamer X.

574
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
I very much am.

575
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,640
Were you persecuted?

576
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,480
Because some of the comments you read on the internet are like, I was scared in a fit.

577
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,160
No, not, not even a little bit.

578
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,880
I mean, I, the short version of this is that I was having a discussion about a month ago

579
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,800
about like the finer points, prejudices and all this stuff.

580
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,800
And I just kind of looked up and I said, screw the labels, be awesome to people.

581
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,320
It was the quick summary.

582
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,720
And I had a hell of a hell of a good time.

583
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,080
I was around plenty of people that I knew.

584
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,120
Uh, I met a couple of people involved, the, um, the guy that was doing visuals, uh, during

585
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,960
the performances on Friday and Saturday night, I wound up having a conversation with him.

586
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,520
I took over the booth for my coworker, uh, so he could go out and get some lunch.

587
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,840
I was talking to people for 30, 45 minutes.

588
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,960
It was as good as all the rest of the cons that I've been to better because it was even

589
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
more.

590
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
I go to anime cons.

591
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
They're okay.

592
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,040
It was more gaming centric and tech centric to an extent.

593
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
And I had fun with it.

594
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
Awesome.

595
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Well, fun's what it's all about, right?

596
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,760
Uh, look at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, uh, DK pop man says, I want to go to a con

597
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,640
and a code man says, I wish I could go to these cons.

598
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,680
Uh, unfortunately I know these guys don't live out here on the West coast.

599
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,040
So it's a little more of an investment.

600
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,720
Uh, Rama says a lot of straight people go to yaoi con.

601
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,840
So yes, they do.

602
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
All right.

603
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,240
Um, so let's see.

604
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,040
I want to, I know you're, I know you're really excited about gamer X map, but I know you

605
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,560
also have this Kickstarter going on right now for this game.

606
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,400
R O M or read only memories, which is a cyberpunk adventure.

607
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,640
Why don't you tell us a little bit about this game?

608
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Yeah, sure.

609
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,280
So, you know, at gamer X, you know, we, we had a really great time and, uh, at the end

610
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,240
of the gamer X, we had, you know, our, our kind of, you know, dead dog, like, Hey, tell

611
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,640
us if you, what you hated or tell us your ideas.

612
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,000
And the thing that kept coming up in the question and answer was like, people were wondering

613
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,760
when we were going to do a game, they really liked our mascots.

614
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,720
And, um, it got us to thinking about the fact that like, you know, we have some really

615
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,680
cool mascots and, um, one of my big like things is like, instead of like, I don't believe

616
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
in complaining.

617
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,480
Um, like I feel like I could go out and, you know, and no disrespect to people that do

618
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,360
do this, but like I could, you know, uh, campaign to boycott things or make a video series or

619
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,380
do whatever, but I wanted to do something that I thought would, you know, create change

620
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,000
and like, so it created, I wanted to create this like safe, uh, space for, you know, queer

621
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
gamers.

622
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,160
And then in the same way, it was like, well, you know, we were in a position where we could

623
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,300
harass the EAs and you know, the Nintendos and Sonys and be like, why are there no queer

624
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,860
characters in games?

625
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,760
But we decided instead of doing that, like, let's just make a game that features gay and

626
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,400
lesbian and queer and trans characters in meaningful ways, isn't shoehorned in that

627
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,560
isn't like a joke.

628
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,000
And I think if we, if it does well and we can show that to people, um, I think that

629
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,600
we can kind of show the gaming world that, see like there is an audience for it.

630
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
It's not that hard to do.

631
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,400
Um, you know, like if anyone, if like, if we could do it without any experience and

632
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,520
just kind of like kind of starting from scratch, then you guys should be able to do it too.

633
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,680
And more selfishly, I mean, we want to make a game, like who doesn't want to make a game?

634
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
I love that.

635
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,400
Well, yeah, I remember one of the, one of the very popular panels at GamerX was when,

636
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,080
you know, one of the game designers got up there and said, all right, everybody, we're

637
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,320
going to make a game right now.

638
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
You're all game designers.

639
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,280
And I thought, I thought that was a really awesome approach to it because I honestly

640
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,660
looked at that and I went, oh my God, I wish I thought to do that for podcasting because

641
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,840
I'm so about like getting more people to podcast independent voices.

642
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Why did, Oh, that was such a good idea.

643
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
You know?

644
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
And I just, I thought that was so awesome.

645
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
So yeah, make games.

646
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,080
You should do that next year.

647
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,880
I darn well might, Matt.

648
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,440
I might be talking to you off air about that.

649
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Yeah.

650
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,720
So I mean like one of the cool things is like, I think you're mentioning Anna Antherby's

651
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
panel, right?

652
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Yeah, exactly.

653
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
Yeah.

654
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,760
So, so she did a game workshop where she was teaching everyone how to use Twime, which

655
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,240
is a really easy to use system to make adventure games.

656
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,840
So one of the cool things is that our engineers who are working on the game, we have two guys

657
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:46,440
who are doing the programming right now, Ted Denola and Luke, sorry, Luke McCampbell.

658
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,720
And they're actually, they actually built a system where we actually, me and the people

659
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,880
who are non-technical, who are writing the story for the game, we're actually writing

660
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,060
out all the story stuff in Twime.

661
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:02,800
And they actually built a engine, a tool that will actually translate the Twime script into

662
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Unity.

663
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Oh, wow.

664
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,760
So that way, and then, so you know, once the game comes out, we're actually going to put

665
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,000
that tool up and that's going to become available for people to, you know, like use and like

666
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,800
other people to like use.

667
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,520
So hopefully it'll be easier for people who make Twime games to make visual Twime games.

668
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,560
That is a fantastic benefit to this Kickstarter that I want to make sure we call out here

669
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,040
and kind of highlight is that, you know, if, if, if this is successful and you're able

670
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:32,000
to put all that together, that can, that can be huge for other people wanting to do this,

671
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
right?

672
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah.

673
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah.

674
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,640
I mean, it's one of those things where like we, I think that there's a lot of people who

675
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,400
want to be able to make games like this and like, I have no idea how to program, like

676
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,080
I can't program at all.

677
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,240
And the guys who are making the programming of the game on our end, like they're pretty

678
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,160
much building out these systems so that way they're like, they can go, here you go, here's

679
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,080
what the, like they're basically making an RPG maker, you know, like basic system for

680
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
me.

681
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,440
So I can just go in and change the text, you know, add in what characters I want to have

682
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
and what places.

683
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,920
So that way they don't even, like I don't even need their help to make the game happen.

684
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,720
And once we have that there, like, you know, I feel like there's so many great stories

685
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,920
that should be told that I think Twime's great, but it'd be cool to be able to show some of

686
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,960
those stories in a more visual way.

687
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,280
Well, obviously, you know, when you talk about the visual and the presentation of the game,

688
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,680
there's many references in your Kickstarter, on the Facebook and so forth, to the gaming

689
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,560
classic Snatcher, which I know we here at OLR are very familiar with, you know, we love

690
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,840
Hideo Kojima and, you know, the things he's done.

691
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,880
And you talk about this in the Kickstarter and so forth.

692
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,820
What is it about that particular game that basically makes it like the framework or inspiration

693
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,940
or whatever you want to call it to tell your own story that you're writing?

694
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,820
I mean, well, Snatcher's definitely in my top five games of all time.

695
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:59,420
And looking at, you know, those top five games, Snatcher seemed like the one that would be,

696
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,140
you know, just from a more realistic perspective of like, what could we actually build with

697
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
a small team?

698
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,020
And, you know, a point and click adventure is something that we're like, okay, like,

699
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,340
that's something that we could definitely do and not overreach.

700
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:19,780
But it was also something where the setting of it, which is, you know, deep in the future,

701
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,060
in Snatcher it's 50 years in the future, so it's in the same, you know, vein, we're 50

702
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,580
years in the future.

703
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:32,420
You know, we can look at the way that the dynamics of queer culture have changed in

704
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:38,260
that, you know, back in the 20s, back in the 30s, if you had a kid and he was dating like

705
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,700
an Irish kid or an Irish girl or whatever, you'd be like, oh, you can't date those Irish,

706
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
you can't date the Polish.

707
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,020
It's like all that shit that like, by the 60s or 70s, no one even cared about that.

708
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,580
And then in the 60s and 70s, you know, you couldn't date out of your own race and things

709
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,580
like that.

710
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,780
And then people kind of, you know, like those people died off.

711
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,460
And now people are upset about people being trans or genderqueer or being, you know, gay

712
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
or lesbian.

713
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,280
And I think as people get over the gay and lesbian thing, then they'll start getting

714
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,780
over the trans and genderqueer thing.

715
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:11,240
And I think that by 2064, hopefully, you know, most characters in the game will have kind

716
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,300
of gotten over a lot of those things.

717
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,160
And so you'll see a lot more gay and lesbian and queer and trans characters that are in

718
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,840
positions of power or positions where they're not, you know, like on a different social

719
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,360
class as they're like, you know, comparatives.

720
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,840
But there'll still be other like, you know, prejudices, like whether that be people who

721
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,360
are against, you know, like I don't want my daughter to marry a robot, you know, they'll

722
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,640
definitely be, you know, like prejudices and like those things will always exist.

723
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,920
But hopefully, you'll be, especially if you're queer, you'll be able to play this game and

724
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,240
identify with gay or trans or queer characters that are in it that, you know, are, they're

725
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,240
not like just there because they're queer, and they're not going to be just good people

726
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
because they're queer.

727
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
But, you know.

728
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,080
Was that possibly a hint to the plot?

729
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,160
Because I picked up on, I know this is in the future, and you've got robots in this

730
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,360
game, and you just said, I don't want my daughter to date a robot.

731
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
Is that a little hint there?

732
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
What might be happening?

733
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Yeah.

734
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,200
So, you know, there's a couple things that we want to introduce, you know, in the game.

735
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,760
There's definitely going to be people who are going to be like cybernetic.

736
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,760
You know, there's these devices called ROMs, and these ROMs can be, you know, we've only

737
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,840
shown off like how Turing looks, but ROMs can be really any size.

738
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,520
They can be, you know, like a wristband, they can be whatever.

739
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,040
Because you know, in the future, we're not going to really like need computers to be

740
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,800
much faster, and computer chips can be so small, they can really fit into anything.

741
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,340
So really, it's about whatever device fits your lifestyle, you know, the best.

742
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:43,900
And so, you may see people who end up becoming, you know, really dependent on those robots.

743
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,100
So you're going to see, you know, people who probably will develop relationships with their

744
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,100
ROMs.

745
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,020
Because, you know, like people even today, like they kind of fall in love with the internet,

746
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,380
and they're like, man, on the internet, there's all these people who, you know, like it's

747
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,060
a better life than in the real world.

748
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
That's very true.

749
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,060
That is very true.

750
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,660
You know, it's going to be interesting to kind of explore that, and one of the things

751
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,620
that I really want to explore with the game is, you know, I come originally from the tech

752
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:17,460
world, and I saw kind of how like kind of devious that people were in terms of trying

753
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:23,140
to get into people's privacy, and use that to, you know, do interesting stuff.

754
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,540
And I think that in the next 50 years, you'll see, you know, a real like all that privacy

755
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,380
will be gone.

756
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,060
And you know, like I think we're already kind of starting to see it, but it will be interesting

757
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:38,700
to kind of be able to talk about that, and actually have a little bit of experience of

758
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:44,540
like knowing some of the people who are actually like kind of putting these processes into

759
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:50,220
place now, and knowing kind of what they dream the future to be, and you know, living out

760
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,860
that world, and seeing if people like it.

761
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,380
Because, you know, there's going to be a lot of advantages to that.

762
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,900
Like your ROM will know the size of your clothes, and be like, hey, you need new boxers, and

763
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,700
there's probably, you know, H&M's having a sale, let's go right now, yay!

764
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Interesting.

765
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,940
I like, yeah, the science fiction angle is pretty cool.

766
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,140
You've definitely got quite the story unraveling here.

767
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,140
I like this.

768
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,140
DarkSakura, you have something to throw in?

769
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,620
I was just saying, I was thinking about a little bit of a Shadowrun without the, you

770
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,260
know, extra fantasy elements that Shadowrun throws in, or I was actually getting a big

771
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,540
hit of rifts too.

772
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,020
I don't know if you ever did any tabletop RPGs?

773
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,900
Yeah, I played a little bit of Shadowrun.

774
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,900
So yeah, I mean, it's definitely something where like, you know, we want to kind of keep

775
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,600
it very close to that cyberpunk niche.

776
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,520
So you're going to see a lot of things that are, you know, like if you watch Blade Runner,

777
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,920
Snatcher, Rise of the Dragon, you know, anything that is like cyberpunk-y, like we're going

778
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,800
to try to keep that as much as possible.

779
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:54,000
While I think one of the biggest things that's changed is that in the 80s and early 90s when

780
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,160
a lot of these cyberpunk things came out, they never could have predicted for what the

781
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,320
internet would be.

782
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,400
And so in our game, we're going to acknowledge that the internet exists and that data is

783
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,920
like this unlimited source of data that can be transmitted anywhere at any time.

784
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,880
And it'll be interesting to see, but also apply kind of a lot of that cyberpunk CRT

785
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,720
monitor FM sounds, you know, like make it feel very 80s and a little backwards at times

786
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
too.

787
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,080
Once again, the Kickstarter is for a game ROM Read Only Memories.

788
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,440
If you want to check that out, unfortunately Kickstarter doesn't really have short URLs,

789
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,120
so I would encourage you to just search for that, Read Only Memories.

790
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,600
You can also back this and some of the rewards include, just for $6, it looks like, for $6

791
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,400
we'll get you the unlock code for the full version when it's released on Ouya or Mac

792
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,040
and PC.

793
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,280
Some of the other rewards, $20, this is the one that I actually personally did, where

794
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,840
you can get your name, company, or website in the credits, because I wanted to give a

795
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,360
little OrangeLawnsRadio.com love in the game.

796
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,080
Alright, I gotta ask, why the Ouya?

797
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,800
Oh, so, well, the cool thing is that they're gonna double our money.

798
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Oh, okay.

799
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Makes sense.

800
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,920
Basically, you know, all that we have to do is that when we launch the game, we're gonna

801
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,920
release it on Mac and PC, and if we hit a stretch goal, also Linux, and then also Ouya

802
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
at the same time.

803
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,240
So we're gonna release it on all four of those platforms.

804
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,160
That's right, I forgot that they open that up to where you can also publish on PC to

805
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,600
be qualified for their, you know, one of the games or whatever they call the thing.

806
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,800
So we're gonna release that game, and we're gonna release it on Steam and PC and Mac and

807
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,200
Ouya all at the same time.

808
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,680
And then, in the six months between when we release it on those systems, and then we release

809
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,720
it on iOS and Android, we'll spend those six months making sure that we fix any bugs that

810
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,160
may have been in the original releases, you know, making it suitable for touch screen

811
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,640
interfaces, you know, making improvements specifically for mobile.

812
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,360
So in actuality, it'd be cool if we released it all at the same time, but we can actually

813
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,520
use that time to make it better.

814
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,080
And yeah, I mean, like, it's free money, and it's something where, like, I'm a big fan

815
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,960
of the idea of the Ouya, like, I like the Android platform, I like the idea that people

816
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,920
can create anything and put it up there.

817
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,320
I mean, I know they've made a lot of PR mistakes, and I know that they're not, like, beloved

818
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,080
by everyone, and, you know, we knew that it wasn't gonna be, like, the best PR decision

819
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,840
to do it, but, like, there's really, you know, like, I still believe it's a good idea, and

820
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,400
I think that this is, like, that's the kind of system that our game would actually be

821
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,160
perfect for, where, like, a long-term story-based adventure game doesn't really exist on that

822
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,160
system, and, I don't know, I think that that might be something that PEW would be into.

823
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,160
That'd be pretty cool.

824
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,760
Let me, I wanna get to some of the chat room questions that we have, too, because we have

825
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,320
a few questions in chat, and I have a couple other questions I wanna ask, though.

826
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,640
One of them here about the music in the game, because I was, I was, I definitely noticed

827
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,720
you had some artists who agreed to help out with the game, Aethernaut, Ver, you know,

828
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,280
some names that people oughta know.

829
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
What kind of soundtrack you try to make with this game?

830
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,240
You know, so one of the things that was really cool about Snatcher was that, although, like,

831
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,200
it was a very, very simple game, like, it was just text, you know, select text, select

832
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,640
text, menus, it had really, really awesome visuals, but more importantly, because it

833
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,960
ran on Sega CD, it had really amazing music, and it was, you know, the music was way out

834
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,120
of proportion for the visuals, and in the same way, like, we wanna have very kind of

835
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:33,040
simple, kind of very, like, 80s, 16-bit visuals, but we want really, like, awesome music, and

836
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,200
so music has been one of the things that we wanted to focus on from the beginning, is,

837
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,640
you know, getting really awesome artists who want to come on, you know, come and be involved

838
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,480
with the game, and, like, you know, we actually just released yesterday on our Kickstarter

839
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,040
update, like, a style sheet of some of the songs that really influenced us, so, like,

840
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,720
you know, some of those include, like, games from the PC-88, and, like, the UNO field stage,

841
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:02,360
and Shin Megami Tensei IV, just all these, like, kind of, like, FM synth-y, very, like,

842
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,640
it's kind of hard to explain, but if you check out the list, we have just some of the music

843
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,040
that inspires us, and, um, Athernaut, and Vert, and Too Mellow, and all these people

844
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,120
that we're working with, like, they just really dug the vibe, and, you know, I think a lot

845
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,400
of them were big fans of Snatcher growing up, and they were really into the idea of,

846
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,760
uh, kind of giving it a try to, you know, making something cyberpunk-y.

847
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,920
Alright, I got one more question for you, and then we're gonna go to some of our chat

848
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,760
questions at live.vognetwork.com. It's not too late to get your question in if you have

849
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,720
a question for Matt Kahn, uh, with GamerX, and Read Only Memories. Um, Matt, I ask this

850
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,720
of everybody who comes on this show to pitch a Kickstarter, so I'm gonna ask you as well.

851
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,920
Um, the funding you're trying to raise for this $62,064, which is kind of a funny number,

852
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,120
but, um, what, what do you need that money for? Where is that money gonna ultimately

853
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,120
go?

854
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,360
Sure. So, um, couple things. So, you know, we, we've, we're working with a team of seven

855
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,080
people. Um, myself, I'm producing the game. We have, uh, John James, who's our lead artist.

856
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,240
Uh, we have, uh, I'm sorry, let me actually make sure I don't get any of his names wrong.

857
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:13,000
Luca Campbell and, um, Ted Danola, they're programming the games. Uh, Ted Danola is,

858
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,320
uh, he used to work at Zynga and Hubby Bunch Productions, and he's, like, was super duper

859
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,760
legit, and he's leading up the, the programming side of things. And so, you know, we've only

860
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,440
started, you know, really getting this program done in the last couple months, and things

861
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,000
have been ramping up super quickly, uh, with him. Um, and then we have, you know, uh, Tumelo,

862
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,200
and we have, uh, Fred, and we have, uh, all these other people who are working on the

863
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,780
music, and especially with, like, people like Athernaut and Vert, like, I could get

864
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,760
them to give us a good deal on music, but I'd rather that, like, they get paid a fair

865
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,600
amount for their work. Um, so, you know, we're just making sure, I wanna make sure that everyone

866
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,520
gets a fair amount, uh, you know, to work on this game. So between all those people,

867
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,240
and then we also have Shams, who's our CFO, mid-boss, and who's gonna be doing all the

868
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,880
fulfillment and stuff. Um, it's a lot of work, and, you know, so the money's mostly going

869
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,480
into paying, you know, those people. Then there's also the Unity fees, um, the, you

870
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,120
know, the actual distribution fees of getting those games out there, and then, you know,

871
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,080
uh, just, like, paying for, like, I wanna have more music, I wanna have more artists

872
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,780
come on board, and I wanna make sure they get, you know, treated right.

873
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,080
And I do notice you have some stretch goals to hopefully, hopefully if you can, uh, get

874
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,200
there, provide, uh, an actual soundtrack, OST, if you've backed to a certain level,

875
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,460
a Linux port, and possibly an art book at different stretch goal levels. But, uh, we

876
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,100
are looking at, uh, 11 days to go, and you've got about 20k to go. So you're, you're on

877
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,220
track, so, um, but, but, you know, every little bit helps, especially meeting those stretch

878
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:43,540
goals. Uh, if you guys are listening here at vognetwork.com, uh, or on the podcast feed

879
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,540
or on Stitcher, uh, definitely encourage you guys to check this out. Uh, you can keep tabs

880
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,660
on, uh, Matt's projects. Uh, gamerconnect.com would probably be the best place to send them.

881
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,380
I'm, I'm not sure where, where your hub is for, for all this.

882
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:58,300
Yeah. Well, I mean, we're actually making a bunch of changes right now, because, like,

883
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:03,200
you know, we, now that we're not just doing gamer acts, um, we're now kind of reforming

884
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,700
as mid-boss, in a way. So, I mean, now we have a game, and we have the, the, the convention.

885
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,780
We're working really hard on gamerconnect.com to get it up to, like, being something really

886
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,940
awesome. But it's just really tough, because it, like, it's basically, we're trying to

887
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:21,260
emulate a lot of features that Facebook has, and it's just hard with one person, you know,

888
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,540
programming it to keep it up. Um, but we, we actually just released, like, a new newsfeed

889
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,900
today, and we really want it to be a place where, like, if you're a queer geek, you can

890
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,620
go and talk about games and relax. Um, and, you know, we just need to put more work into

891
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,540
it and make sure that, like, it's, runs fast and looks good. And, um, part of that is just

892
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,860
we don't really have the money yet to, to hire people to do that. Um, but yeah, so if

893
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:49,220
you go to Gamer Connect, it has, uh, all, all of our projects. Uh, Gamer X 2 is next

894
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:54,340
July. Um, and you can get your tickets now. Um, and also, one of the cool things about

895
00:46:54,380 --> 00:47:00,380
Read Only Memories is you can actually get tickets for Gamer X 2, uh, in the, the rewards,

896
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,700
um, for the Kickstarter.

897
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,140
Nice.

898
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:07,940
And, um, so, like, the, for the $79 level, that's only $9 more than a regular three-day

899
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:12,780
ticket. Um, and then for that, you get, you know, three copies of the game, you get the

900
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:17,540
beanie, you get the stickers, and you get a ticket to the con, and that money gets doubled

901
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,780
for us because of OUYA, so you're helping us out too. So, it's a good deal.

902
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,340
Awesome. Well, Matt, I hope we're not taking up too much of your time, but I do want to

903
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,740
get some chat questions, if you don't mind, just a couple quick ones here.

904
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,140
Yeah, sure.

905
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,460
Uh, DungeonBuster in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, asking, will ROM have action sequences like

906
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,100
in Snatcher? As good as Snatcher is, I think it could just stood well enough without them,

907
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,580
and if you do have them, will there, will there be an option to skip them?

908
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:47,580
Yeah, so, uh, I don't want there to be action sequences. Um, you know, I did not, so, I

909
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,540
didn't mind the action sequences in, um, in Snatcher. I actually thought that they were

910
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:58,660
okay. Uh, I, if you've ever played Policenauts, which is sort of like the spiritual sequel

911
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:05,260
in a way to Snatcher, um, I did not enjoy the action sequences in that. That was too,

912
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:10,620
like, with Snatcher, they had, like, the, um, like the grid format, they totally ditched

913
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:15,500
it for Policenauts, and this expected you had a light gun, um, so it's impossible to

914
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:21,420
play, like, as emulation or without the gun. Um, and then with Rise of the Dragon, it just

915
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:28,220
has the worst, awful, just disgusting arcade elements you've ever seen in your life. Like,

916
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,340
it's got this really cool gameplay, and then you go into the arcade elements, and your

917
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:37,140
character, when he jumps, he jumps, like, 30 feet in the air, and it just, it is, like,

918
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:42,140
it's disgusting. Like, if you, like, if you play it, you would be sick to your stomach.

919
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,780
Um, so that being said, you know, like, we also don't have, like, a ton of experience

920
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,540
with, you know, like, this is a pretty new team, and we have two really awesome programmers,

921
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:57,140
but, um, you know, I've seen what we're doing with the, uh, with the dialogue and inventory

922
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:02,540
and how we're working on that, and I feel like, you know, I don't want to shoehorn anything

923
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:07,340
in that isn't going to feel natural to the game. Um, if there is going to be minigames,

924
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:12,420
it would probably be more around, like, hey, you need to move these wires around to unlock

925
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,820
this puzzle. Um, so I would think that it would be more around, like, puzzle stuff,

926
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:22,660
and things, you know, that aren't, like, time-based or, or whatever, um, because I've, I've usually

927
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,220
found that in adventure games, uh, action scenes, while they're fun and they kind of

928
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,900
keep you on your toes, can be really, really frustrating, um, and not, and, and not very

929
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:39,220
fun, uh, because, um, um, it can be a blockade to progress the story, too, which I, I can

930
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,340
totally see that element of it, like, how many times have, like, forget it, I can't

931
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,500
get past this one thing in the game, forget it, I'm out, I'm out, and then, you know,

932
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:50,460
you would miss the story, so I, I totally, I totally hear you on that. Um, one more question

933
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:55,300
here from chat, this is a question about GamerX, uh, from SSJ100Matt in the, uh, chat room

934
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:00,300
at live.vognetwork.com asks, um, I understand this is still very new, but what do you see

935
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,660
as the future of GamerX, what is the next step, because this is a great idea that I

936
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:11,540
could see growing even more. Yeah, I mean, you know, our, our, the whole plan for GamerX,

937
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:16,980
we recently, you know, appointed a new president, whose, uh, name's Tony, and they are awesome,

938
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,980
um, and the, the idea for GamerX is, like, when we first created it, and when I first

939
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,740
created SFGamers, I wanted there to be a safe space for other, you know, gay and queer gamers

940
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:32,260
like myself, and I kind of used the word gamer because I kind of always kind of thought

941
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,940
that was a really super-inclusive word. Uh, you know, I always, but, you know, the more

942
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,740
I've, I've kind of met people, I've realized that the name is kind of, in a way, it can

943
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,620
be a little off-putting to straight people who want to come, and, and people who want

944
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:50,060
to come who aren't necessarily gay, uh, identifying, um, and I don't want the con to be something

945
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,380
where people feel uncomfortable going because of the name, or even because of the vibe,

946
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,540
you know, I want the vibe just to be a place where anyone, no matter whether they be gender

947
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:05,500
queer, or straight, or, you know, a furry, or an ally, or a trans, or bi, or just a woman,

948
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,860
anyone who maybe feels like they aren't culturally accepted by, like, the mainstream gaming media

949
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:15,220
to be able to come and feel like they're on an equal-level playing field where people

950
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,940
aren't going to judge you because of, you know, some preconceived notions of, like,

951
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,980
oh, well, you're a girl, so you can't play games, or you're gay, you can't play games,

952
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,380
or whatever, I mean, I think you look at, like, players like Scarlett, who almost just

953
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,140
won the world championships for League of, not League of Legends, Starcraft, and, you

954
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:35,100
know, who's a trans woman, and it's like, obviously, women and queer people can play

955
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,260
games, um, you know, I want it to be a place where everyone's treated with respect, but

956
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,180
I want it to also be a place where, like, if you're a straight person, like, I'm sick

957
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,580
of people being like, oh, I can't go to this because it's a gay event, I'm like, no, it's

958
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:52,340
like, it's not really like that, it's more like, um, almost, and I even hesitate to compare

959
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,700
it to this, but like an LGBT film festival, where it's like, you know, you might see some

960
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,060
films that have queer content in them, or you might have conversations that have, that

961
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,220
talk about some gay stuff, but like, for the most part, it's a gaming convention, and I

962
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,740
think that you'll find that most gamers, you know, care more about games than anything

963
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:14,140
else in their lives, but that being said, you know, the gays and the queers of us also

964
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,180
deserve to be able to feel comfortable and be able to flirt with one another in a safe

965
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,180
environment.

966
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,780
Um, an interesting response here from Queen Simia in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

967
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,820
says there's that, and I thought personally, if I attended GamerX as a straight cis woman,

968
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,420
I'd be invading a safe space.

969
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,740
I don't, I don't think that's the case at all.

970
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:38,100
No, no, I mean, like, you know, we actually had Anita Sarkeesian was there, and we had

971
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,140
a ton of really awesome women who came, who were just, you know, regular cis, you know,

972
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:47,020
just, you know, cis women, and, you know, they actually really enjoyed it, and like,

973
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:52,300
I feel like it's something where, you know, where it's kind of almost comparable to a

974
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:57,160
gay club, where it's like, a lot of cis women go to gay clubs in San Francisco because they

975
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,220
know that they'll be in a safe space, where they know that they'll be treated with respect,

976
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,420
and, you know, like, they're not going to be, like, groped on or, like, hit on, like,

977
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:10,580
unnecessarily, and just be able to dance and have fun, and in the same way, you know, like,

978
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:16,260
I think it's just, like, we, we, I think we as gamers, and by that I mean, like, queer

979
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,100
gamers, like, we don't want other people to not come.

980
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,620
I think that we want people to acknowledge who we are.

981
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,860
I think it, the more that people acknowledge, hey, that, you know, we are an existing group,

982
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,060
and that, you know, we're just like you and everyone else, like, that's really, really

983
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:35,400
important, because, like, I don't subscribe to that whole idea of, like, oh, we're making

984
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,620
gamer acts to make an exclusionary event, you know, you should only go to gamer acts

985
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,500
and don't go to PAX and don't go to E3, because, like, that's silly, like, people can go to

986
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,820
as many conversations as they want, what can I afford to go to, and this is just a different

987
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,140
experience that, like, one that, like, we're trying to kind of create, like, something

988
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,660
that's not really out there right now.

989
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:00,860
Yeah, you know, I gotta say, Matt, as, as somebody who, you know, for a period in my

990
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:04,940
late teens and early 20s, I literally thought I was the only gay nerd, like, I, I, there

991
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,620
was one, I thought I was the only gay nerd on the whole damn planet, so, to now, you

992
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,940
know, maybe, maybe now I'm in my mid-30s, but to see something like this happen was,

993
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:16,900
was really amazing, Matt, and I, I gotta thank you and your team for doing this, because

994
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:21,220
I'm, like, oh, my God, and I'm, I'm speaking from experience here, you guys, like, to be

995
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,940
that 18 or 19-year-old who is thinking that, like, I am the only gay nerd on the entire

996
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:28,980
planet to be, to be shown, like, no, you're not.

997
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,820
You're the only gay nerd in the village.

998
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:37,740
But, but, no, you're not, and to have, to, to kind of have that celebration, not just,

999
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:43,620
like, look, other gay nerds, but a celebration of all things nerd is just, I, it, it meant

1000
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,380
a lot to me personally, and I was so happy to see it happen, so.

1001
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,380
Oh, thank you.

1002
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:52,300
I mean, like, that's kind of my whole goal with it, is, like, I think back to my 16-year-old

1003
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,740
gay nerdy self and, like, how much of the time I would either hang out with gay people

1004
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:00,580
and I would, like, have to hide being a nerdy, or I would hang out with nerdy people and

1005
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:06,380
have to hide being gay, and I felt like I was living a lesser life than my true self,

1006
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,020
and I feel like if people can look at GamerX and see there's thousands of other queer

1007
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,940
geeks out there just like them, hopefully they won't feel like they're alone.

1008
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,820
They feel, you know, the whole point of creating GamerConnect was so that way people can, you

1009
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:21,180
know, can connect with their community and find other people in their community, and,

1010
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,980
like, I remember, like, being in college and finding gaygamer.net and being, like, this

1011
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:31,220
is what I've been, like, looking for my entire life, and I, I felt like if I can help other

1012
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:34,460
people find that, like, that's, like, my calling in a way.

1013
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,340
Uh, Jamie, you have one more thought here?

1014
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,220
Oh, it wasn't a very big thing.

1015
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:41,220
I was actually just wondering how the asexual turnout is.

1016
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,980
Um, you know, we, so we don't obviously ask people at the door.

1017
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,580
Well, I mean, but I was just wondering if there was representation.

1018
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,340
Oh, yeah, I mean, so the thing is that, like, we, we try to accommodate, like, everything

1019
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:57,420
in terms of, like, panels, like, I, I don't remember exactly what panels we had last year

1020
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:02,580
off the top of my head, but I know that we had panels that, that, I know for sure that

1021
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,140
we had panels that were submitted about, like, you know, it being asexual and being

1022
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:11,460
in the community, and, you know, as someone who, I dated someone who was asexual, um,

1023
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:15,260
I think that's, you know, like, I, I obviously don't think that there's any lifestyle that

1024
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,340
isn't valid, but, like, I totally understand, and I want that, I think a lot of people have

1025
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:24,180
a lot of ignorance about, um, people who are asexual, and I think that, um, more education

1026
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,700
along those lines would be great, um, so, uh, although I can't, like, I can't speak

1027
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,580
to the, to the attendance of it at that level, I would love to see more panels by people

1028
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:37,300
who either identify as asexual, who want to talk about asexual, you know, ideas, especially

1029
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,980
as they pertain to gaming, at GamerX, too, I think that would be super duper awesome.

1030
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,660
It's, it's funny, I actually did have an idea for a panel.

1031
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,660
Yeah, bring it on.

1032
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,660
We better, we better write that down.

1033
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:50,660
Asexuality and shipping, why it's a nightmare.

1034
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:55,380
Uh, so, yeah, I, you know, GamerX, definitely a celebration of diversity, and I think it's

1035
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,820
only gonna be a bigger celebration in this next year.

1036
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:03,060
Uh, Matt, I wish you the best of luck with GamerX, too, and, uh, and your team, as well.

1037
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:07,100
I know, I know, uh, Tony is, is leading it now, and, and, uh, it will, it will be fabulous

1038
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,700
with the, uh, group that you helped assemble last year.

1039
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,700
I know it.

1040
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,500
Uh, and of course, with this game, Read Only Memories, a new cyberpunk adventure, please

1041
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,300
check it out on Kickstarter, take a look at the video, and, uh, let's see if we can't

1042
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,020
help, uh, Matt raise that $20,000 more they need to get it to happen.

1043
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:27,420
Um, Matt, before I, I get any last plugs from you and let you go, I do have to ask you about

1044
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,620
one other topic that's completely different, like, you were not prepared to talk about

1045
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,620
this, you ready?

1046
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,620
Yeah, I got it.

1047
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:38,980
Alright, okay, I'm gonna bring it, because, here's the thing, now, DarkSakura, she doesn't

1048
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,620
watch a lot of reality television.

1049
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,620
No, I don't.

1050
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:47,980
But, there is a show in Britain about Britain's worst driver, and they adapted it in Canada,

1051
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,540
and you love you, you love yourself some Canada's worst driver.

1052
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,540
I love Canada's worst driver.

1053
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:57,020
Did you know that Matt, and this is on Wiki, so I know it's true, Matt was a contestant

1054
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,220
on America's worst driver.

1055
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,220
Really?

1056
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:05,380
And, Matt, am I correct, now, spoiler alert, Matt, you won the whole damn thing, didn't

1057
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,380
you?

1058
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,380
Yeah, I am America's worst driver.

1059
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:14,060
Oh my, now, I haven't watched the American one just because I heard that it was, like,

1060
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,820
way too Americanized, because the Canadian one is just awesome.

1061
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,980
It's like, we teach you how to do stunt driving, and you have to do all this.

1062
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,980
It's very polite.

1063
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,340
Yeah, well, it is, it is really, well, I don't know, there's this one girl who's kind of

1064
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:31,740
freaking out on, they're doing worst driver ever this season, but what was it like for

1065
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,740
you?

1066
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,180
I mean, was it embarrassing to be on it, or did you learn something from it, or?

1067
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:41,460
No, well, the thing is that, like, you know, at this point, I don't really care what the

1068
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,460
challenge channel does to me.

1069
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,700
I mean, so the whole thing was all scripted.

1070
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:50,780
So like, each city that we went to, they would be like, okay, so the rules were, there was

1071
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:55,460
eight, well, okay, so all scripted is maybe not exactly correct, so there's eight cities

1072
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:59,140
that they would go to, and in each of the cities, they said, okay, so there's going

1073
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,980
to be four contestants, and the worst driver in the city would have their car destroyed.

1074
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,860
However, those contestants would then be brought back for the finale, where seven out of those

1075
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,380
eight teams would win brand new cars.

1076
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:13,300
So basically, they're telling you to lose, so that way you'd have a seven out of eight

1077
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,780
chance to win a new car.

1078
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:22,060
So in each of the cities, every single, like, it's super fake, because all eight episodes,

1079
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:27,420
the people, everyone's trying to do the worst thing possible, and I was just able to win

1080
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:32,060
in San Francisco, because I was trying to, I mean, I had a really crappy car, and so

1081
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:36,580
I was willing to, like, basically total it on the show either way.

1082
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,100
So I was just totally breaking all the rules, I was driving down Lombard Street and crashing

1083
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,780
into shit, and I was having a blast.

1084
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:46,620
If you watch the first episode, the first episode of the finale, first episode, I'm

1085
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:50,540
having so much fun, I'm actually, like, I'm never tripping at all, like, I'm just like,

1086
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:55,140
yeah, this is great, I'm having fun, and then in the finale, then it was, like, actually

1087
00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:00,900
a real contest, where they would have, like, elimination-style challenges.

1088
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,780
It's something where they never let you watch the other people compete, and they don't have

1089
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,780
any, like, times.

1090
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:10,380
They have to be like, yeah, you won or lost, and someone during my SF thing actually carried

1091
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:14,940
a stopwatch in their pocket, and the time that they got was completely different than

1092
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,780
the thing they had in their pocket, which meant that they were like, yeah, this whole

1093
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,780
show's fixed.

1094
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:26,660
Anyways, as fixed or not, in the finale, I watched as, you know, as there's eight teams,

1095
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,020
and I'm, like, super confident, and I'm just like, yeah, like, you know, I'm not a bad

1096
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,060
driver, there's no way I'm gonna lose all these people, and I watched it go from eight

1097
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:37,260
teams to seven teams to six teams to five teams, and, you know, watching my expression

1098
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,300
and, like, I was wearing demon horns in the first episode, like, super fun, and, like,

1099
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,660
having fun, and then by the time there's, like, three teams left, I'm like, shit, I'm

1100
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,660
literally gonna lose.

1101
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,020
I'm gonna lose not just my car, but, like, everyone else is gonna walk away with a brand

1102
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:53,660
new car, which, before, they were like, oh, yeah, you can just take the value of the car,

1103
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:57,860
so I was like, I'm gonna walk out of here with nothing, and then I got to two teams,

1104
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,540
and I was like, oh, my God, and if you watch in the last scene where it's, like, me versus

1105
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:05,620
the other team, like, me and my partner are freaking out, because I think we already know

1106
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,260
that we're gonna lose, like, it's just pretty obvious it's, like, two, like, little shithead

1107
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:16,060
kids versus, like, this, like, really, really, like, sweet, like, you know, like, older women,

1108
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:20,460
not, like, older, but, like, you know, there are people who didn't deserve to lose versus,

1109
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:27,020
like, two brats, and it was just, you know, I think I knew that, like, storyline-wise

1110
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:32,700
we were gonna lose, I was panicking, and I wasn't driving well, and I lost, and then

1111
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:37,220
they were like, oh, we're gonna, the Robosaurus is gonna destroy the new car, the person who

1112
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:41,140
lost, and then, so, destroyed the car that I would have gotten.

1113
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,700
Did they have Robosaurus in Canada?

1114
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,980
No, this is completely different than the Canadian version.

1115
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,220
Yeah, in the Canadian version, they basically pick, like, eight drivers from around the

1116
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,900
different provinces who can't drive for a different reason, and then they actually go

1117
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,700
through driver rehab, and if you get voted off, that means you actually were a good driver

1118
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,560
when you graduated rehab.

1119
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,020
If you win the whole thing, that means you are the worst driver.

1120
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,300
You get, like, a trophy of crashed car parts.

1121
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,860
Yeah, so we didn't get, we didn't get any training or anything, like, we just had the

1122
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,460
first episode, and then they were like, come back to the finale, and they never gave us

1123
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:16,100
any, like, training, they just were like, eh.

1124
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,100
It just seems like the only similarity is the name, then.

1125
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,100
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1126
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:25,460
Well, I had to, I had to bring, I know it has nothing to do with video games, but knowing

1127
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,760
that Dark Soccer loves her, Canada is the worst, I had to ask you about that, and I

1128
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,980
even see some comments in the chatroom, Code Man says, I've never watched this, but it

1129
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,540
sounds awesome, Dungeon Buster says, it was cancelled after one season, yes, cancelled

1130
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,540
after one season.

1131
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,740
Dungeon Buster says, it was the worst show, it was so bad, I knew while we were filming

1132
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:43,420
it was going to be cancelled, and it was so bad.

1133
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,300
I love that you have a great sense of humor about it, though.

1134
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:48,580
I just wonder if they had kept, like, the original format, if it would have lasted,

1135
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,180
because, I mean, it's on its eighth season in Canada now.

1136
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,180
We'll never know.

1137
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:55,180
I bet you they would have, I mean, like, the thing is that when they're filming it, I could

1138
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:58,980
tell it was going to be really bad, and then I found out the time slot was, like, Saturdays

1139
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:04,060
at 10pm, travel channel, I was like, man, they have no confidence in the show.

1140
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:08,100
Yeah, see, I've actually learned stuff watching the Canadian version, and I know Canadian

1141
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,100
road signs now.

1142
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,180
Are they that different?

1143
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,180
I didn't realize.

1144
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,180
There's some that are different.

1145
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,180
Alright, Matt, we've got to let you go, thank you so much for having a good sense of humor

1146
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:20,740
about that, and seriously, I mean it, I am so looking forward to GamerX2 and everything

1147
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:24,580
your whole team's putting on, and best of luck with Read Only Memories, I hope you make

1148
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:25,580
it.

1149
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:29,140
Yeah, thank you so much for having me on, like, I'd love to chat more, and yeah, please

1150
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:33,420
check out Read Only Memories, we still have tickets to GamerX2 on there that are, like,

1151
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:37,420
super cheap, and if you back it on there, then we actually, we're just going to basically

1152
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:40,740
double your money, so you're going to make a really awesome game on top of it.

1153
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:46,180
Awesome, well best of luck to you guys, and yes, we'll keep in touch, and I will see you

1154
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:49,780
at least at GamerX2, if not a heck of a lot sooner, because I'm in San Francisco, like,

1155
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:50,780
all the time, so.

1156
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:55,740
Yeah, we'll get some, you know, some really nice ethnic food, we can go get some Peruvian

1157
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,740
food down in...

1158
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,740
Awesome.

1159
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:58,740
Good.

1160
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:01,500
And then you can watch me have seven drinks, like I did last night, make a fool out of

1161
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,500
myself.

1162
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,500
Oh, right.

1163
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
Alright, Matt, buddy, take care, and good luck.

1164
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,500
Alright, man, have a great day.

1165
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:07,580
Good.

1166
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,580
Alright, take care.

1167
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,580
Stop.

1168
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,580
Alright, that was great.

1169
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,580
I like him.

1170
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,580
Yeah, he's fun.

1171
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,580
He's fun.

1172
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,580
Alright.

1173
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,580
I'm trying to convince Dan to let me buy the $80 package.

1174
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,580
Nice.

1175
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,580
Dan, money.

1176
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:18,580
Dan, package.

1177
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:19,580
It's Hanukkah, for God's sake.

1178
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:26,420
Well, it is, but he already bought me games, so.

1179
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:27,420
Somebody give me 80 bucks.

1180
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,420
Alright.

1181
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,420
It'll go to a good cause.

1182
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,420
It'll go to me.

1183
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,100
I know that went on a little long, sorry, I think I ate more show than we intended to,

1184
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,420
but Matt was a lot of fun, I had to ask him about the worst driver thing I had to.

1185
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,340
Live.vognetwork.com, if you want to keep commenting.

1186
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,980
You forgot to ask him what he was playing.

1187
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:41,980
I did.

1188
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,980
Shame.

1189
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:46,700
What's more important, though, the where's the money going question or the what are you

1190
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:47,700
playing question?

1191
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,220
I think the more important one was the worst driver.

1192
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,900
That was, that was the most important question.

1193
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:52,900
Alright.

1194
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:58,300
I'm sorry, that was awesome, and now I know that I'm glad I didn't watch the American.

1195
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,540
Because I thought about going back to find it, because, you know, you know me, I've seen

1196
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,900
every, except for the last two episodes.

1197
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:05,900
You come in here all the time.

1198
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,380
I hate TV.

1199
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,380
I never watch TV, but Canada's the worst driver.

1200
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:09,380
Oh my god.

1201
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,380
It's cause I watch it on YouTube.

1202
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,380
Alright.

1203
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,380
We gotta get back to games.

1204
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:17,220
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1205
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:19,220
use the passphrase, adult.

1206
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:22,660
Quickly, let's try to get through the rest of our gaming weeks, and then some of the

1207
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,660
news as well.

1208
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:24,660
Loki.

1209
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,620
So this week I played a few things.

1210
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:34,900
I've been meaning to play Fallout New Vegas since last Steam sale, and so I finally got

1211
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:40,340
around to playing it, and I did not like it, and I was so disappointed because I really

1212
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,860
had high hopes for that game, and I just can't get into it.

1213
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:48,500
I think it's just the game itself looks really dated, like I'm running it on Ultra, so it's,

1214
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,180
you know, it doesn't look that pretty to begin with.

1215
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,220
And I'm sure I could fix some of the stuff with mods, I just haven't gotten around to

1216
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,460
it, and it's like I don't know if I want to spend the effort to do that right now.

1217
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,420
But anyways, I just didn't like the setting.

1218
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,300
I didn't like the story, because I didn't understand what the hell was going on, and

1219
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,940
I just didn't like the way it played.

1220
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:17,780
There's no fucking sprint for one, at least I couldn't find it.

1221
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:22,220
So it was just, I don't know, it bugged me, it just rubbed me the wrong way I guess, and

1222
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:25,700
so I don't know if I'm going to continue on with it.

1223
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:31,460
That said, I also played Minecraft this week, just for a little bit.

1224
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:36,420
I went ahead and updated my version I had on PC to get the latest thing, because they

1225
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:40,300
just put an update out not too long ago, it's like 1.7.2 now.

1226
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,060
I didn't realize that, I need to check it out too.

1227
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:49,180
Yeah, they've got like, it's changed, like holy shit, the biomes now are really intricate.

1228
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:55,180
Like I reloaded our seed that we had, and it's fucking terrible now, let's be honest.

1229
01:06:55,180 --> 01:07:00,380
I'm like oh my god, well this seed's terrible now, I hate it, I'm like in a fucking swamp.

1230
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:03,820
Well what happened to my cool jungle that I was in?

1231
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:08,820
So I just went ahead and, I just messed around with that for a little bit, but yeah, it's

1232
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:09,820
pretty cool.

1233
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:13,740
If you just do the new world seed or whatever, there's this huge fucking mountain that appears

1234
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,900
right next to you, and that was kind of neat.

1235
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:20,460
And then they also have the ones where you can spawn these really, I don't know what

1236
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:26,300
they call it, basically exaggerated versions of the different biomes and stuff, almost

1237
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:30,020
like extreme or something, and it looks really unique.

1238
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,140
Very tall mountains and stuff.

1239
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:39,340
I haven't gone around to setting up the multiplayer server, so I don't know about that yet.

1240
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:43,980
Then also, I'm hoping for a VoG Minecraft server comeback in 2014, I'm hoping.

1241
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,340
I have all the information to do it, I just haven't gone around to it.

1242
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:49,580
There's no more Team Fortress 2 servers, so maybe I can redirect the money.

1243
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:54,660
We have, well no, no, we have, Gali has offered us his server, so.

1244
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:58,300
No hate against Team Fortress 2 by the way, I still love Team Fortress 2, it wasn't really

1245
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,300
being used.

1246
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,300
Yeah.

1247
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,300
Next game.

1248
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:05,340
Gali has a server up, but that's the thing that was getting people on it, because it

1249
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:08,900
was a ghost town, most of the time.

1250
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:12,220
That's kind of the problem with anything that we do, even Team Fortress 2 and stuff, it's

1251
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,060
a ghost town most of the time.

1252
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:20,740
So I don't know, and even Creative Mode gets boring after a while, survival at least, there's

1253
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:24,300
something, if you're playing on your own, there's stuff that you can be doing, whereas

1254
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:28,460
it's like, if you go into Creative Mode, it's like, okay, I'm gonna look around at what

1255
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:31,900
people made, and what am I gonna build now?

1256
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,340
Fuck if I know, I don't know.

1257
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,820
So it's, there's just no happy medium there.

1258
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:41,340
Okay, so anyways, enough Minecraft, and actually, it was just because I was installing it on

1259
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:46,500
my friend's computer, so, because he has an account, he used to play with us occasionally,

1260
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,140
and now I built him a PC, so I put it on there for him.

1261
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:55,300
And then Steam Sale, I've been looking at stuff, I almost bought a lot of things, but

1262
01:08:55,300 --> 01:09:00,540
the only thing I bought is just the season pass for Saints Row 4.

1263
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:06,020
Now I know I said I wasn't gonna do that, but it was on sale 66% off, and I feel that

1264
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:11,020
the price of that is definitely worth what they're giving me, although what it gave me

1265
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:16,260
instead of really shitty DLC was a thing that broke my game, and so now I had to uninstall

1266
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,580
it, and I have to reinstall it and see if that fixes it.

1267
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,900
I thought at first, oh, it's because I have mods that I made and put in there and stuff

1268
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,980
like that, well I took all those out and it still didn't fucking work, so I'm a little

1269
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:31,100
disappointed that it broke the whole game, so we'll see if I reload it, maybe it'll fix

1270
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:36,820
itself and I can start slowly loading the mods in and see if that works again, but I'm

1271
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:41,100
just, it's annoying, to say the least.

1272
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:48,180
And then LittleBigGrandpaThoughtOfFive did a, got in the back of a train and got five

1273
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,980
stars and was sniping people with my sniper rifle and stuff as Trevor, so that was kind

1274
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:54,980
of fun.

1275
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,380
I have to bring this up, you mentioned Steam Sale and Dark Soccer, because it was like,

1276
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:03,380
oh, 6 o'clock, new Flash sales, so she just loaded it up on her iPad, and literally at

1277
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,420
the same time we both pointed and went, Deadpool!

1278
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,980
I don't care how shitty this game is, I don't care how shitty it is.

1279
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:15,380
I'm getting the fucking Deadpool game because fuck, it's Deadpool, and I'm a consumer whore.

1280
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,380
It's one of those nights.

1281
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:22,180
Nah, I was trying to get Bobby to buy Saints Row, they had it down at $19, so I was like,

1282
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:23,180
okay.

1283
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:27,300
But yeah, so I've been good, I've been thinking like, okay, I'm gonna buy these games, like

1284
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:35,500
I almost bought Fallout 3, almost bought, what was it, Far Cry 3, almost bought Rise

1285
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:40,060
of the Triad, because that was down to like $5.09.

1286
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:44,940
Still might, I don't know, but I'm looking at my library of games I have and I'm like,

1287
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,620
I haven't played most of this stuff.

1288
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:48,500
If I buy these, I'm not gonna play them either.

1289
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:52,820
You need to make a resolution of yourself like Dark Soccer did, that you'll play one

1290
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:53,820
a week.

1291
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:57,420
I'm not playing one a week, okay, that's not gonna happen.

1292
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:03,380
The wife is expecting a new baby soon, and so that means more than you might think right

1293
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,380
now, Logan.

1294
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:11,620
But like Bioshock, for example, Bioshock Infinite came down to about $7 on Gamefly.

1295
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:15,100
I was like, you know, I should just buy it for that, but I'm like, no, I fucking played

1296
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:18,900
through it on Xbox 360, am I really gonna play through the game again?

1297
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,900
No.

1298
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:24,540
Why am I cluttering my fucking account with these games I'm never gonna play?

1299
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:28,860
So that's kinda where I'm at.

1300
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:33,940
But there is a nice gap between now and when more games are coming out, so I do have time

1301
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,980
to catch up.

1302
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:40,020
I do want to play more Grand Theft Auto 5, but my wife has been wanting to watch Hulu,

1303
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:43,980
and she doesn't like the Playstation 3 controller, because if you set it on the couch the right

1304
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:48,580
way, or not the right way, it accidentally taps one of those analog sticks and fast forwards

1305
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:53,100
and she throws a fit, I'm like, ugh, fine, so, you know, and I wanted to play with my

1306
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:59,020
360 character to get it up to where my PS3 character is, but I may just have to go PS3,

1307
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,020
I guess.

1308
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,020
Alright, anything else?

1309
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,660
We gotta keep moving here.

1310
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:03,660
I can't log in.

1311
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,660
Aww.

1312
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,660
Well, the good news is you-

1313
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,660
I'm still gonna get home.

1314
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,660
Yeah, you have until, like, 2 AM.

1315
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,380
Alright, I'm gonna try to quickly go through my gaming week.

1316
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:13,300
A lot of the usual suspects, a lot of the same stuff I talked about this week, continuing

1317
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:17,940
to progress in Zelda and Mario and so forth, but I also fell victim to the Steam sale,

1318
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:22,100
I picked up a few games, I'm gonna try to make this quick, a few games I picked up.

1319
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,100
DLC Quest, I bought.

1320
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,620
I did remember what the game I bought was.

1321
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,620
What's that?

1322
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:27,620
Shadowrun.

1323
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,620
Oh, okay.

1324
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:29,620
Oh, what were you talking about earlier?

1325
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:30,620
Yeah.

1326
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,620
DLC Quest.

1327
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:36,180
Like, I like DLC Quest as like a commentary, and obviously it's a little bit biting on

1328
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,740
the state of DLC and so forth.

1329
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:46,260
It was a dollar on sale, and that's- it was a fun little adventure game, a little silly,

1330
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,580
it's not particularly difficult, I beat it in one sitting.

1331
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:55,780
There is an expansion, like the freemium isn't free or something like that was the expansion,

1332
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,780
and I'm in the middle of that right now.

1333
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:02,260
The game's not really particularly difficult, and at its core, you've really played a game

1334
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:06,940
like this a thousand times, because since the coin is, you know, the coins that you

1335
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:11,820
used to get the quote-unquote DLC are just things you pick up in game, we've all played

1336
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,740
that game where it's like, now you have to get this item to go unlock this door.

1337
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:19,540
Now you need to get this item to get past this- you know, we've all played a game like

1338
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:22,180
that before, it's a very common formula in games.

1339
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,140
I'm not razzing this game for that, because again, it's a budget game, it's an indie game.

1340
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,140
It's also pretty old, too.

1341
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:31,620
Yeah, it has been out a little while, and you have to remember it's more a commentary,

1342
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:37,180
and it does have a funny little script to it, and I did lol a few times, so you know,

1343
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:40,900
for a dollar or even three dollars or whatever they're asking for it normally, it's a fine

1344
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:47,060
little evening jaunt through DLC Quest, so check that one out.

1345
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:50,940
I also checked out a game called Splunky, which I'd been wanting to check out for a

1346
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:54,860
long time, and then finally when it hit, what, four bucks or whatever it was, I was like,

1347
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:00,060
I like this game an awful lot, I am fucking terrible at it, but I find that I'm learning

1348
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,060
more and more.

1349
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:05,660
I'm gonna tell you what I love most about Splunky, I am a whore for roguelike games.

1350
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:09,480
You know, the roguelike games, like Back to the Old School Rogue, and you know, Rogue

1351
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:14,620
Legacy even is like a roguelike game, obviously, Splunky's kinda like that too, and you find

1352
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:18,500
more layers of the game as you progress, like, oh, I've never seen this item before, what

1353
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,500
does this do?

1354
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:26,820
You know, all the levels are randomly generated, it's fun, and one thing I love a lot about

1355
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:32,740
it is it really reminds me of a classic PC game, but kinda done in modern context.

1356
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,980
I don't really know how else to put my finger on it, but I just feel like when I'm playing

1357
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:41,260
it, I'm playing like an old game on the Commodore 64, but that looks like a game on the PlayStation

1358
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,060
3 or the modern PC or what have you.

1359
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:49,340
So I enjoyed Splunky, I was surprised there's no internet multiplayer, but there's local

1360
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:52,860
multiplayer, but there are like challenge boards where one, you know, you'll have a

1361
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:58,220
certain level set that you can only play once per day, and you go as far as you can, and

1362
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,620
once you're done, you're done.

1363
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,860
There's a whole community around this game, like live streams of people doing that and

1364
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:08,300
so forth, so I enjoyed Splunky, I think I got it at a steal, I think the game is worth

1365
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:11,420
whatever they're asking for, normally like $15 or what have you, right?

1366
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,940
So Splunky, I will probably be talking about this game more in future weeks, we have a

1367
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:15,940
little more time.

1368
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:23,340
Last game I picked up, Gone Home, I bought for $5 and it was on sale, and I will tell

1369
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:29,980
you this, I was, I started Gone Home at about probably 9 o'clock on Friday night, I just

1370
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:33,860
kind of said, alright, I need to check out this game finally, I started playing it, I

1371
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:38,300
did not get up out of my chair, except maybe to use the restroom and get water, until I

1372
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:44,540
beat the game at about 1am, so I played this thing from start to finish, I was really into

1373
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,540
it.

1374
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:50,300
I will say this, and this is probably a common thing you're going to hear about Gone Home,

1375
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:59,580
it's not really a game, but it's definitely an interactive story, I feel like it's best

1376
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:05,500
described, this is how I felt about it, it's like a first person movie, imagine you control

1377
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:13,100
the movie, that's kind of what this game felt like to me, at its core, I could probably,

1378
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:16,860
I'm not going to, but I could probably spoil the whole damn thing for you in three sentences,

1379
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:20,900
like the whole game, I'm not going to do that, because that would be a dick thing to do,

1380
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:27,380
and I think watching the layers of it unfold, it's not so much the punchline quote unquote,

1381
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:32,020
like I could tell you those three sentences that would ruin the game for you, but at the

1382
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:38,580
same time I think it's about how we get to that, and all those really kind of unsettling

1383
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:43,460
things and the way things are presented in the game that really made this game a very

1384
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:48,100
special experience, I'm just going to say it's not for everybody, because some people

1385
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:53,500
are going to play this and be like, wait a minute, this is not the game I was expecting

1386
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:58,140
at all, so you got to be prepared that it's going to be a little bit more of a story that

1387
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:05,260
slowly unravels, and there's really not like challenge to it per se, there's no monster

1388
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:08,460
that's going to jump out from behind the curtain and eat you to death, although you

1389
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:13,060
might get that impression from what you see about the game and so forth, it's actually

1390
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:16,100
very much not like that at all.

1391
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:24,020
My one issue with the game is that because I think it was trying to present itself one

1392
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:28,400
way and then kind of end up being another sort of story, I feel like there were things

1393
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,220
in a context that weren't fully explored, I'm being vague on purpose because I don't

1394
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:35,700
want to ruin this for you, but I felt there were certain things that didn't really get

1395
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,100
explored enough.

1396
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:42,060
When the game ended, I did feel resolution, I felt satisfaction, I felt like, wow, that

1397
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:46,780
was a good movie I just watched, like I really felt that when I finished the game, except

1398
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:49,500
I was like, but what about that subplot?

1399
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:54,380
What about this subplot didn't really resolve, I'm not sure if I missed something or something,

1400
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:58,540
and I'm trying to think of a non-spoilery way to say this for people who have played

1401
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,620
the game.

1402
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:04,200
The uncle, I'll say that, so if you've played the game you'll notice, but the uncle, I kind

1403
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:08,300
of feel like that was left unresolved for me, whereas everything else was fine.

1404
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:15,240
So for $5 it was definitely worth it, I think the game normally is like, what, 10 or 15,

1405
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,740
I just want to caution you, although I felt it was good and you would pay 10 or 15 for

1406
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:25,820
a movie, some people may not feel the value when it's only going to take you 3 to 4 hours

1407
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:30,220
to beat, if that, some of you will probably fly through it faster than me, I'm very, you

1408
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:34,140
know, OCD with the games and looking at every little corner, which actually pays off in

1409
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:37,060
this game immensely, I just want to kind of warn you that.

1410
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:40,380
Now there are some things they do to try to enhance the value, like there's a director's

1411
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:44,220
commentary mode you can play through and so forth to try and encourage a second play and

1412
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:48,660
so on, but I just want to warn you, if you're expecting like, oh I'm going to buy this game

1413
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:53,460
and it's going to give me hundreds of hours of satisfaction, think of it more like a movie

1414
01:18:53,460 --> 01:19:00,220
because that's kind of what it is, it's more like an interactive movie, but I sort of,

1415
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:09,360
I sort of really love, how do I put my finger on this, I just kind of love what I think

1416
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:16,660
this game may have started, for, that was incredibly distinct and clear, I know right,

1417
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:21,860
I feel like this is going to be the first, or maybe not even the first, because I can

1418
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:25,420
think of other games I've played like this, but I think this is going to be a definitely

1419
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:28,900
notable, and you're seeing it getting game of the year nods and so forth and so on, I

1420
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:33,540
think this is going to be one of those games where we look back and we go, you know, this

1421
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:38,740
is the point that this art form really started to take off.

1422
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:43,060
I guess that's the best I can say without like totally ruining things, sorry guys.

1423
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:47,900
Alright, anyhow, clear as mud, I know right, right there with you, alright, if you want

1424
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:51,100
to talk spoilers we can maybe later, I gotta wait for the six months to be out, has it

1425
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:54,860
been out for six months, when it's been out six months I can talk spoilers, because that's

1426
01:19:54,860 --> 01:20:00,220
the agreed upon moratorium on spoilers right, I'll encourage you don't go out there and

1427
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,740
spoil it for yourself, because again it could be spoiled for you in three sentences and

1428
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:07,380
there's some real dickheads that spoil it in comments and so forth, I really think it's

1429
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:14,460
best experience getting in there and doing it, alright, Jason, quickly, your gaming week.

1430
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:19,100
Pretty light week because Monday through Wednesday we're spent wrapping up everything at work

1431
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:26,140
and then I've been around doing a lot of different things, my sale haul was that I picked up

1432
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:31,620
a two pack of Divekick and I need to figure out what to do with the second copy, I picked

1433
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:38,540
up Splunky as well, Final Fantasy 7, the Bioshock triple pack and Counter Strike Go, still not

1434
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:42,460
entirely sure why because I've never been good at that game or anything of the sort

1435
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:48,260
but I have it and Raginator has thanked me numerous times both in chat and then he mentioned

1436
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:55,260
it when he called into Bobby's show, Bobby Black Wolf, 6pm Pacific, 5pm Pacific, 6pm

1437
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:01,980
the time zone you're used to, so close, as he sat on his call I picked up the Saints

1438
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:06,140
Row pack for him, he was talking about it, he wanted some stuff to play, it was dirt

1439
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:11,100
cheap and it is a lot of content, I really enjoyed Saints Row 3, so I threw the pack

1440
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:16,860
his way, because I've been moving around so much this week I've actually gotten back into

1441
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:21,980
the mobile swing of things again, I picked up Sonic Dash which is just an endless runner,

1442
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:26,260
time killing kind of game, I've been very addicted to Quiz Up in the last week or two

1443
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:29,980
and me and Rob played around with it the other night, that is a fun little iPhone game, very

1444
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:34,220
fun, it's very well curated, which means in 60 days we'll no longer be playing it, that's

1445
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:38,740
what happens to iPhone games, and then there was the other, was it just those two, I feel

1446
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:45,120
like there was a third game that I've been playing, Phone or iPad rather often, but probably

1447
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,860
just Quiz Up and Sonic Dash, the usual suspects, a little bit of Rogue Legacy, a little bit

1448
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:58,060
of FTL, FTL randoms were abysmally terrible and I just got destroyed before I even hit

1449
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:02,880
like the third sector, and a couple more power ups in Rogue Legacy, still plowing through

1450
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,600
that, trying to get further, pick up more equipment, pieces of equipment and upgrades

1451
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,120
and all that, the usual.

1452
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,400
Alrighty, let me quickly do some housekeeping and then we'll go into the news for tonight,

1453
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:17,040
so as always I do want to encourage you guys to follow us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash

1454
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:21,460
Orange Lounge Radio and then we'll also be on Twitter, Twitter.com slash O-L-R, I want

1455
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:25,700
to address the YouTube expansion real quick because last week I mentioned I put the show

1456
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:32,340
up on YouTube, it took me a little while to do and so, and I've kind of been able to watch

1457
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,680
like oh how was it received this week and so forth, so I kind of made a decision on

1458
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,280
how we're going to kind of treat the YouTube thing going forward, so this is how it's going

1459
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,360
to work is that we will post the episodes to YouTube, obviously there will not be video

1460
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,680
so there's just going to be audio for archive purposes, we will post the shows to YouTube

1461
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:52,120
but we're going to post them on a one week delay and you might be thinking like what,

1462
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,360
why would you do that?

1463
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:57,920
Well because I love the idea of like YouTube for like the archive purposes and so forth

1464
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,040
and kind of being able to go find your favorite parts of the show and so forth and all that

1465
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:07,600
but I'm going to just keep it real with you guys, we want the hits at OrangeOnTrader.com

1466
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:12,440
and BogNetwork.com, I mean YouTube is great for discovery and so forth and branching out

1467
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:19,480
to that audience but it really helps us in being able to you know get into, sell the

1468
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:26,440
show as media and help with events and so forth if we can get the hits with OrangeOnTrader.com

1469
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:32,400
and so forth so the podcast and Stitcher and TuneIn and those sorts of apps that tap into

1470
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:37,120
the official podcast feed, those are the ways we sort of prefer that people listen to the

1471
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,260
show so those are the ones that we're going to support with the immediate Sunday night

1472
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:47,180
uploads but we will continue to support YouTube on the delay, I will say this though just

1473
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:51,840
so that if you're like a YouTube dedicated person I don't want you to get upset because

1474
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,060
definitely we're exploring what are other ways we can actually get involved with actual

1475
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:59,780
video on YouTube, I know I've been doing that a lot through my own channel, plug plug Rob

1476
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:05,340
Roberts Plays, plug plug and I'm sure there will be more stuff to come in the future so

1477
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:09,680
stay tuned for you know things that aren't just audio archives of the show and hopefully

1478
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:15,300
some more interactive content over on the YouTube. Alright let's get into some gaming

1479
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,800
news, we're going to try to move through it quickly because we're already an hour twenty

1480
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,400
minutes into the show but we'll try to get through this quickly, Loki why don't you start

1481
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:27,280
us off with some news tonight. Alright so as we mentioned last week there have been

1482
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:33,800
some people using Playroom on the Playstation 4 as a means to kind of broadcast themselves

1483
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:40,520
almost like a talk show format or whatever and some people have been abusing that to

1484
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:46,640
broadcast themselves doing pornographic things which I'm personally fine with but apparently

1485
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:54,360
Twitch isn't so because of that Twitch has momentarily removed the Playroom content from

1486
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:59,360
the directory because they say the majority of it was non-gaming related and they may

1487
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:08,320
add it back later on if you know the gameplay stuff is more gaming related later on I guess

1488
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:15,800
I don't know so oh well it's all it takes is a few people to run it for everybody. This

1489
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:19,680
is I mean there was a part of me that was like oh that's so frustrating I mean it's

1490
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,720
not that I'm like sitting here going oh Twitch shouldn't have done that I mean they kind

1491
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:28,160
of had to because people were you know abusing it or whatever but I was just like damn it

1492
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:33,400
really sucks that there wasn't a way to really kind of manage that and I don't know what

1493
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:38,520
you could do I mean it's the whole infamous TTP joke we make here on Orange Lawns Radio

1494
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:43,240
where you put a new peripheral out there and what's the time to penis how long before somebody

1495
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:48,240
puts their dick in it or shows their dick on it or so forth. Or draws a dick. Exactly

1496
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:52,800
as we found with this it wasn't very long at all and that's why it's you know gotten

1497
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,040
pulled and so forth there were some really disgusting things that were going on on Playroom

1498
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,200
like I'm not I'm not just talking about like showing body parts there's really disgusting

1499
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:04,560
things happening. Yeah I saw them. So yeah well so I understand completely why they pulled

1500
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,760
it but damn it because there was some great potential there for people to start their

1501
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,800
own homegrown broadcasts and get voices out there and so forth I guess you could still

1502
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,600
you do that on Ustream so I would encourage you if you were one of those people that was

1503
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:24,860
like shit I could have used Playroom to start my podcast or to start my video show don't

1504
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:29,180
let that discourage you completely you could feasibly still do Ustream it's gonna be a

1505
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:33,780
little harder to build an audience but you know what you gotta start somewhere. Or you

1506
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:38,940
could probably get drivers for that camera eventually and. Yeah that'll happen too. I

1507
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:43,820
don't know I think that has a special adapter for it though or a special like proprietary

1508
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:48,420
plug or something but you know they'll come out with something I mean they did it with

1509
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:52,860
you know with the Kinect and stuff so that and honestly it doesn't probably cost too

1510
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:58,780
much to get you know some sort of webcam and a lot of computers have webcams built

1511
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:03,780
into them or even laptops and stuff so you know I wouldn't say you can afford a you know

1512
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:07,740
PlayStation 4 you probably could afford a you know a webcam if you really wanted to

1513
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:12,980
do that. Yeah so yeah and I'm all for more voices more broadcasting getting out there

1514
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:18,420
so just you know kind of on a side note but damn you people that had to go do nasty shit

1515
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:25,980
on Playroom and really ruin it for everybody. Jerks. Alright moving on some changes going

1516
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:30,060
on with Miiverse and this has to do with the integration between the 3DS is gonna be coming

1517
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:34,540
on board and they're getting Miiverse so there's been some changes with Miiverse that happened

1518
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:39,820
this past week and obviously this is to support this whole consolidation. Some new display

1519
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:44,220
options in the community list you can display more communities at once there's also gonna

1520
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:49,300
be communities based on categories like Wii U software, Virtual Console and assumably

1521
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:55,500
3DS and so on. Your profile will no longer display the total number of YAS you've given

1522
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:59,580
which was basically how many inches your Nintendo E-peen was was right there on your profile

1523
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:03,500
like how many people have clicked like on my post that's not there anymore so there's

1524
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:10,100
no more competition I suppose. You can still see your YAS on individual posts. Also the

1525
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:14,460
default display setting in the community when you entered the community before you

1526
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:20,080
would see everybody's posts. Now it defaults to only showing you posts from people who've

1527
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:25,980
actually played the game. You can take that out and look at every post if you want to

1528
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:29,980
but I kind of understand that change. I do. You want the discussion to be people who've

1529
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:33,860
actually played the game. It's unfortunate for the people who might be popping in there

1530
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:38,540
to ask is this you know would I like this game but there's other places on the internet

1531
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:44,120
you can go for that really. The Miiverse integration of Mario 3D World is a lot of

1532
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:50,180
fun though. I really crack up at some of the stuff I see. Miiverse is so interesting. Just

1533
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:54,260
when you think Nintendo really doesn't understand online whatsoever you kind of look at Miiverse

1534
01:28:54,260 --> 01:29:00,700
and go nobody's really doing that and it is kind of neat like when it works. Anyway one

1535
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:04,780
other thing that is neat to be a part of if you're lucky enough to be there you might

1536
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:09,060
actually get a free Wii U console if you end up on the right Southwest Airlines flight.

1537
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:13,460
Yeah a Southwest Airlines flight. Apparently Nintendo and Southwest Airlines partnered

1538
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:18,720
up. Nintendo is like the official video game company of Southwest Airlines. There's gaming

1539
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:23,020
lounges in some of the heavy traffic Southwest airports which would be what like Las Vegas

1540
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:29,300
I imagine has got to have something and they're giving away games and so forth and Flight

1541
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:35,860
1883 which went from New Orleans to Dallas Love Field last week they gave over 100 passengers

1542
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:40,020
a brand new Wii U console. So it's just kind of different ways to I mean we might be sitting

1543
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,980
here looking at that going that's kind of weird but it's just marketing it's just different

1544
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:47,940
ways to market you know. Sony's doing something about PS4 on Facebook so yeah one of their

1545
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:53,220
those reblog campaigns. Yeah they gave away two of them at the Sharks game last night.

1546
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:58,940
So you know and I'm sure an Xbox they they went to some YouTubers houses and were giving

1547
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:03,700
them Xbox. Some of their vocal critics were giving them Xbox ones. Francis was the one

1548
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:08,260
that saw one. Apparently they're not listening to our show. I know right. That was the only

1549
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:12,340
reason you were so mad. Loki you were just trying to get a free one. I'm not mad at all.

1550
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:18,420
Like I said I'm not going to turn down free but you know. Anyway so yeah Fly More Southwest

1551
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:23,660
I suppose if you want to possibly win a free Wii U. That's a good excuse to go Southwest

1552
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:28,060
as your airline. I don't know what. The most entertaining flights I've ever had were Southwest

1553
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:33,440
flights. That's true. Let's just go to Disneyland a bunch. Well see I do not not again we're

1554
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,620
not commercially endorsed but I do have to give JetBlue a shout out because I do love

1555
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:42,380
those TVs because I flew cross country and watched five hours of SpongeBob SquarePants.

1556
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:47,420
Best flight best flight ever took to New York City. That sounds awful. For the record. Haters

1557
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:52,520
gonna hate. For the record. What. Crap what was it. It wasn't Delta. It was something

1558
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:59,640
I when I flew to Alabama. Seriously the worst thing ever. It was US air I'm sure. Oh American

1559
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:06,480
American Airlines. Awful. All right. What do you have for us. I have some crap because

1560
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:15,300
this is a bunch of crap. So once again Shenmue three ain't happening. That whole trademark

1561
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:24,400
application. Fake. Sega's like no. Didn't we tell you this for the last ten years. No.

1562
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,340
Now I think there's a silver lining to this we'll get into later in the show but there's

1563
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:35,100
another fake too. Go ahead. For a Fallout 4. Well it's gonna happen eventually. We all

1564
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:39,660
know Fallout 4 is going to happen. But the one that's up right now has like a fake trailer

1565
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:45,280
and everything and it's no. So and you know there's been a ton of this with Blizzard related

1566
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,920
products to a fake trademark. So you know I think the lesson we all need to learn from

1567
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:55,760
these various fake trademark stories. Stop running with articles. Just stop on trade.

1568
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:02,720
Just stop. But trademarks don't mean anything anymore. So trademarks patents stop. Yeah

1569
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:08,040
probably something else too. IMDB pages. Stop. Yes stop. All of it. Not news sources. These

1570
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:12,120
are no longer credible news sources done. You're saying 4chan's not a reliable news

1571
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:19,320
source. I hate to offend but you know I just. In places I think to go for gaming news that's

1572
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:24,720
not really at the top of the list. Biting gaming commentary perhaps but not for gaming

1573
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:30,640
news. For the record SpongeBob is the devil. Whatever. Hater. He's not the devil he's too

1574
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:36,760
dumb to be the devil. Alright. I seriously tried to watch that episode an episode of

1575
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:41,240
that and I thought I could feel my brain melting. It was awful. It's just fucking Ren and Simpy

1576
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:45,600
under the sea. That's all it is. I mean Ren and Simpy was cool. Do you hate Adventure

1577
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,160
Time too because that shows. No I love Adventure Time. I don't get you because I love Adventure

1578
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:54,280
Time too. But I heard the game is not so great. A friend told me that the game is like it's

1579
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,520
only fun if you have like multiplayer but like a single player it's the why why are

1580
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,560
we in the dungeon. I don't know or whatever that game is called. I've heard it's great

1581
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,760
for multiplayer but for single players. I almost picked it up. Yeah. Yeah. If we find

1582
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:13,240
it on sale we should do a multiplayer. I found a used copy. Just tell me which system you

1583
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:18,000
guys get it on and I'll bug my D3 rep to give me a copy because he loves me so. How about

1584
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,480
you get three copies. Yeah I don't think that's gonna work. Or four Jason wants one too. Alright

1585
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:27,240
let's travel around the world and check out release dates. There might not be a lot but

1586
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:31,120
we'll try anyway. Release dates. This is easy because I already memorized this one. There's

1587
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,480
only one game coming out this week and that's Gran Turismo 6 and it's on Friday. Nice. On

1588
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:42,160
PlayStation 3. Lots of cars. Pretty big. Pretty big game. Yeah. We don't have to wait three

1589
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:48,240
years. Alright and so it will actually be happening. Now how can we prove to Bobby Blackwolf

1590
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:52,520
that the game will actually be coming out because he doesn't think Gran Turismo 5 ever

1591
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:56,600
happened. This is actually happening. It hasn't been delayed. They announced it was coming

1592
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:05,440
out you know quarter four 2013 and we're in quarter four 2013 no delays so we're all good.

1593
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,920
So what we need to do is we need everybody to go to like you know your local game store

1594
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,760
wherever it is when you see Gran Turismo 6 sitting on the shelf you need to take a picture

1595
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:23,120
of it and put it on Twitter. Hashtag believe me Bobby. And and you can drive on the moon.

1596
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:28,760
Get the fuck out. You can drive on the moon. You can drive on the moon. Is it moon patrol?

1597
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:32,200
No they have a moon you have a moon lander that you can drive and there's actual achievements

1598
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:36,060
for driving on the moon. If you can have aliens and Bill Clinton in a hot tub at the end of

1599
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:44,560
Cruise and World then you know. Alright going to Japan you have a little more to look forward

1600
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,840
to this week. Gran Turismo 6 is there as well but there's some other games as well. Metal

1601
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:54,300
Gear Rising Revengeance gets a special edition on the PlayStation 3. Daikokai Jidai Online

1602
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:59,760
Gran Atlas is released this week. Kaihu Shoujo Sin in regular and limited edition also this

1603
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:05,240
week and there are Gran Turismo 6 PlayStation 3 bundles this week so if you're in Japan you've

1604
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:09,240
been holding out on a PlayStation 3 and maybe this is the game that's going to do it for you

1605
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:15,200
believe me Bobby it's out in Japan this week so there you go. Also the Walking Dead comes out in

1606
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:22,120
Japan. Is this the I'm trying to look real quick oh this is the Telltale version the good one not

1607
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:26,560
the crappy shooter this is the good Walking Dead comes out in Japan this week I imagine it must

1608
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:30,000
finally have been localized and that's why it's just now getting released. Remember if it's

1609
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,240
survival instinct use your instincts to not buy it. Yes absolutely no this is the good Walking Dead

1610
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:41,120
coming out on PlayStation 3 this week in Japan. Going to the Xbox 360 Batman Arkham Origins on

1611
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:49,160
360 this week also there's an Xbox 360 slim with a 320 gig hard drive being released this week I'm

1612
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:53,880
not sure what that's in celebration of it just an excuse to get another 360 on the shelf I suppose.

1613
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:59,960
On the Vita this week Batman Arkham Origins is there as well and there's a new lime green white

1614
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:04,840
pink black and light blue white Vita's those those models are making their way out this week. Also

1615
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:08,280
tear away which has been getting really good reviews over here I haven't played it myself

1616
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:14,520
yet but tear away finally gets its release on the Vita this week in Japan and looking at the Wii U

1617
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:20,720
and the 3ds you have Batman Arkham Origins on Wii U also Dragon Quest 10 the which is the Dragon

1618
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:24,640
Quest online this must be some type of price reduction oh no it's the Wii U version because

1619
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:29,680
it was originally out on Wii so the Wii U version finally makes its entrance to Japan this week and

1620
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:35,320
all those of us in America are just sitting here going when do we get a turn and the answer may be

1621
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:40,880
never unfortunately but on the Nintendo 3ds bravely default for the sequel Geist Crusher

1622
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:50,560
Inazuma 11 Go Galaxy Big Bang and Galaxy Supernova and some Hello Kitty purses and pouches four

1623
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:56,680
your 3ds LL or XL but LL Japan are released this week because you know you want a my melody pouch

1624
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:03,320
in pink or red. No I want a Duffy case give me a Duffy case for my DS. Stay tuned all right those

1625
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:06,760
are the releases in Japan so much busier week in Japan than here in the States how about the UK?

1626
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:13,680
A little busier on the fourth we have dark out for PC on the fifth Space Hulk on iPad Speedball

1627
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:22,120
2 HD steamworld dig for Mac and PC and bravely default for the sequel on 3ds and then on the

1628
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:29,160
sixth the Scribblenauts Unlimited for 3ds and Wii U. All right just a few more stories for you guys

1629
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:36,920
than the classic game of the week but first Loki. I just realized that Just Cause 2 multiplayer is

1630
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:42,560
coming back or is coming to steam that's fucking awesome so seriously buy Just Cause 2 if you

1631
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:48,160
haven't already because it's like two bucks multiplayer without but like the thousand people

1632
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:55,600
at a time. You're given an awful lot of endorsements tonight. Dude it's a it's a sandbox game with guns

1633
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:03,840
and vehicles and stuff and grappling hooks with a thousand people at one time. I mean come on that

1634
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:08,640
sounds fucking awesome. Granted that should have been especially with grappling hooks. Anyways

1635
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:20,320
so Microsoft of course you know they're gonna be launching the Xbox one in Japan later on in 2014

1636
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:29,120
and to go along with that they are teaming up with some developers or Japanese developers to be exact

1637
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:35,680
to offer some games that may be exclusive to the Xbox one platform and of course those haven't

1638
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:44,280
been revealed yet but they will be full Japanese games and not like you know digital games like

1639
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:51,120
Panzer Dragoon or something like that and of course announcements coming later on about that

1640
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:57,800
I'm not sure where they're supposed to announcement or you know announce all that stuff but soon

1641
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:04,840
hopefully since I want to say they're launching in the spring I may be thinking PlayStation 3 but

1642
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:12,680
I don't know that's kind of neat at least they're seems to be taking it kind of seriously you know

1643
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:18,760
so maybe kind of a turnaround for what we saw in the 360 Microsoft really wants to get their foot

1644
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:24,000
in Japan Japanese households maybe we'll see something like you know we saw with like Blue

1645
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,920
Dragon and stuff like that you know maybe something along those lines I imagine too this is

1646
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:33,280
timed because the Xbox one is not out in Japan but perhaps they're gonna start you know before it's

1647
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:36,560
released there in 2014 they're gonna really start to get some of this news out here you know they

1648
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:41,160
got there they have leveraged Square Enix to give them another Dragon Quest game maybe Dragon Quest

1649
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:45,600
you know was it 11 11 or so maybe on 11 now because they're probably not gonna get 10 well

1650
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:52,080
never say never you know and the end if Microsoft reverses its policies Microsoft could get Final

1651
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:58,360
Fantasy 14 realm reborn too it's it's known that Square Enix wanted to do it for 360 and it's just

1652
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,960
Microsoft's the one that did not but they they will not budge on the cross servers thing that

1653
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:06,320
and I I props to Square Enix for not budging on that so it'll be interesting if they can kind of

1654
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:10,680
sit together at the table they did it for 11 they can do it for 14 that would be interesting very

1655
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:18,160
interesting all right um also interesting of note news coming out of Japan Super Mario 3d world the

1656
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:25,160
sales figures are in and well unfortunately it doesn't look great there's some conflicting

1657
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:30,760
reports about how much it's sold media create says they sold just under a hundred thousand

1658
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:36,800
units of Super Mario 3d world and for me too says it was about 107 K so either way you're looking at

1659
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:43,920
about a hundred thousand sold here's the thing to put that into perspective Mario 3d land three

1660
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:50,080
hundred and forty four thousand that's the 3ds one Super Mario Sunshine two hundred and eighty

1661
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:54,880
thousand which you know of the modern games it seems like sunshine gets dumped on the most I

1662
01:40:54,880 --> 01:41:02,160
just thrown it out there Super Mario 64 on the 3ds the remake hundred and twenty still sold more

1663
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:08,000
than Super Mario 3d world now I'm not saying this are those like lifetime sales or is that no first

1664
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,440
week sales are all first week so oh no god oh all those games sold over a million except for

1665
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:17,920
Sunshine actually didn't in Japan sunshine ended with seven hundred and eighty nine thousand and

1666
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,480
change but here's the thing I don't want this to be like oh we're kicking Nintendo while they're

1667
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:29,240
down or the sky is falling or whatever but I bring this up because you know I I you know Nintendo

1668
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:33,840
ain't going bankrupt so stop those rumors and that shit survive the virtual boy they'll survive

1669
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:39,200
this I was gonna mention the numbers are on VG charts for North America are they I didn't know

1670
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,840
they were out yes they they're always a week behind but two hundred and forty three thousand

1671
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:51,160
Wow okay so interesting not exactly a bust Europe did it come out over there in Europe let's see

1672
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:59,560
here Europe mmm I guess it did not come out over there yet yeah that's a very interesting silver

1673
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:03,920
lining is that it sold twice as many in the u.s. as it did in Japan that's very interesting it

1674
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,760
more than twice hold on let's give me weird for dates here okay and then yeah they're saying 101

1675
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:17,120
101 798 is in Japan I'm gonna check Europe again because give me a weird date oh they don't see

1676
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:23,840
that's it they don't have last week they only have up to the 16th so the the problem that people are

1677
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,400
really identifying with this is that you know for the install base of the Wii and this is important

1678
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,880
to say for the install base that the Wii U has currently we all know that we use struggle in a

1679
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:36,880
little bit it's no secret so for the install base at the Wii U has those numbers aren't bad but the

1680
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,360
problem is is the game was expected to push more we use sales and that we're not seeing that really

1681
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:47,400
happened in Japan yet again I think it's a little too early to say the sky is falling completely but

1682
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:51,440
I think there are a lot of us that are rooting for Nintendo and and really hope they can turn

1683
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:57,280
it around but it's gonna I really wish they had had a second game like this to really kick I mean

1684
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:02,520
they certainly have it on the 3ds but I wish they had a another game to kind of kick out the gate

1685
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:07,920
this winner with this to really get people talking I guess you could say Zelda Wind Waker but again I

1686
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:14,640
just something kind of new I don't know I I just to really push those Wii U units because I

1687
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:19,480
definitely don't want to see Nintendo fail none of us do well that's the thing is I'm curious to

1688
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:26,320
see what they're selling as far as you know we use systems because you know it's good that they

1689
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:31,680
sold those games but I'm sure that they have more than 200,000 we you know we use systems out there

1690
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:38,040
and I just be curious to see how that's actually translating to new sales you know what a very

1691
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:42,440
interesting point in our chat room at live dot vog network comm made by dungeon buster who says

1692
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:47,560
lightning returns also sold considerably less than its release window in Japan when compared

1693
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:53,440
to Final Fantasy 13 2 which was lower in opening sales than Final Fantasy 13 it just sounds like

1694
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:59,320
the sales were soft for titles in general in Japan and that legends all linked between worlds

1695
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:07,360
294,000 and that's that's like you know that's through the 23rd that's day one sales yeah not

1696
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:13,880
surprised that I games amazing um and SG 100 Matt says the game came out at a bad time with all the

1697
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:19,080
new consoles coming out now not Japan though remember Japan didn't have a PlayStation 4 and

1698
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:24,120
Xbox one till next year but Xbox one no but it was still imminent for the PlayStation well

1699
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:28,100
Nintendo's kind of competing against themselves in a way in Japan right now with 3ds I mean sure

1700
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:33,920
Sony's trying to up the presence with a Vita and it's you know it's somewhat working but Nintendo's

1701
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:39,560
biggest enemy in a way is a 3ds gaming on the go don't underestimate how huge gaming on the go is

1702
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:44,640
over there I mean obviously considering all the devices that you kids are all distracting yourselves

1703
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:53,440
with right now clearly well not this week but to your credit you don't have Animal Crossing right

1704
01:44:53,440 --> 01:45:01,200
now I didn't even consider my purse and I have Zelda plugged in right now actually I know yeah

1705
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:06,720
go ahead I should log in you should should open the gate no I I definitely agree with that point

1706
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:12,480
that it's trending mobile and when you're trying to hold on to uh you know like the same the same

1707
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:18,200
issue with PC desktops and everything else these long these older inflexible yeah they may have

1708
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:24,400
more features but you cannot play them anywhere else without difficulty you're right mobile is

1709
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:31,800
the up-and-comer and it will be biting sales in out from a lot of other things all right well

1710
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:37,240
we'll see I mean again week one let's let's see how this game does through the holiday season we'll

1711
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:43,320
see but it could be very interesting to see what this is gonna have Nintendo doing in 2014 but you

1712
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:48,480
know what it's not over it ain't over all right uh let's move on you know what let's move back to a

1713
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:54,160
classic time when we didn't fucking stress on how well a game sold because we didn't find out for

1714
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:58,240
like three months because we got all our news from magazines I want to know what's up with Jason's

1715
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:07,080
monkey hat you're talking about on the 3ds right yes well let's let's travel back to a time when

1716
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:11,120
we were getting our news from magazines and we were playing classic video games on classic

1717
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:15,720
consoles back when the Nintendo that was on the block was the Super Nintendo it's a classic game

1718
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:19,960
of the week y'all where dark soccer jumps into the vault picks the game that she thinks hey you

1719
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:25,640
should be playing this why cuz it's rad tonight's pick definitely rad dark soccer which picked me

1720
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:30,520
I picked marble madness just because I had that stupid level two music stuck in my head doo doo

1721
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:35,880
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo never pick this game before it's so good I

1722
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:44,160
was never a superfan of marble madness because it pisses me off sorry very loud dongs from from

1723
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:50,200
marble manas sorry guys but the best music was the level two music for the record at any rate

1724
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:58,920
it was designed by Mark Kearney and it came out in 1984 it was an arcade game it was being it was

1725
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:03,080
one of the most innovative games when it came out it used the Atari system one hardware and

1726
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:10,520
programmed in C one of the first games to be programmed in NC on the hardware it was also the

1727
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:19,080
first to use true stereo sound previous ones use simulated stereo or mono so this one basically in

1728
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:25,040
fact I'm actually just gonna pull this quote right here it was the designer drew inspiration from

1729
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:31,880
mini golf racing games and MC Escher which we can totally see where that came from so basically the

1730
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:38,800
way you play marble madness is you are a little marble and you work your marble through a mazes

1731
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:46,080
of different kind but you use a trackball although home versions used different controllers with

1732
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:52,920
directional pads which is probably why I hated playing it on the nest so yeah you have a different

1733
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:58,280
you know you can do practice each one has a theme there's even like a backwards level where you go

1734
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:07,040
up instead of you know the usual down the course type of method the other thing with this one too

1735
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:17,480
is that it was just a really freaking bizarre and neat game for its time I mean what was trying to

1736
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:23,480
think of what the word I'm trying to think of for the perspective isometric thank you isometric

1737
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:30,200
it uses an isometric perspective you're looking at it on diagonal it simulates a feeling of three

1738
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:35,160
dimensions very nicely sorry I'm just watching this awesome bad I know right here on YouTube

1739
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:39,560
and he's in that upside-down level right now and I'm just remembering what a mind fuck that level

1740
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:44,040
was because like gravity goes the other way you just you don't know how mad bad that messes with

1741
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:51,920
you tell you play it oh yeah I mean the whole game was just such a neat game and I mean on top

1742
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,560
this is an arcade when he's doing it with travel you have to play this game with a trackball if

1743
01:48:55,560 --> 01:49:01,960
you want to play with any kind of accuracy I do believe actually have this on Atari 5200 I want

1744
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:10,200
to say because we've got a trackball anyway um moving back into some of the background on the

1745
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:16,040
game actually the guy who was working on this was supposed to be doing a video game version of

1746
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:20,920
thriller Michael Jackson's thriller and it was canceled so they moved into Marvel madness this

1747
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:28,680
particular one at his time was using a 19 inch CRT monitor and a Motorola 68 0 10 central

1748
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:36,560
processing unit and it just basically was pretty tech heavy for its time I mean it was at the edge

1749
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:46,160
so as far as other and there's actually there are whole just different has a programming tricks

1750
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:55,600
that went in this game it did shadows to control anti aliasing it did a light ray tracing I mean

1751
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:01,120
the technology behind this game it's a programming Marvel for its time I mean to be honest there are

1752
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:05,200
there's actually I believe the whole site full of nothing but concept sketches that went behind

1753
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:12,800
this and the programming direction really neat stuff so it was a big commercial success there

1754
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:18,200
were 4,000 cabinets sold and it was its highest-earning game in arcades at the time but

1755
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:26,080
then it fell after seven weeks and really it was because it's such a short game but it is still

1756
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:33,920
people just got frustrated to hell there really the lot of thing is that because it was it took

1757
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:40,680
such a high level of skill to play that's what made it really just an attractive game to have

1758
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:50,560
a game to play so with that too there were other versions and a potential sequel and I will go

1759
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:57,000
ahead and put this out there I think that super monkey ball was definitely influenced by this

1760
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:04,200
game easily so as far as other versions there was a tiger electronics handheld LCD game which

1761
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:12,600
I had and rare released the Nintendo version there I mean they were all very simple they you

1762
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:19,800
know weren't as great clearly as the arcade one other versions that came out were of Amiga Game

1763
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:27,680
Boy Sega Mega Drive the spectrum PC and GBA just all kinds of different versions of course we've

1764
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:32,920
seen the rereleases on more modern systems in the various Midway compilations and Williams

1765
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:39,560
compilations there was an arcade sequel that was planned in 1991 called marble mad marble madness

1766
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:48,600
2 it was in development by Kearney's partner for the first one Bob Flanagan but it just it was

1767
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:56,520
supposed to expand have invisibility flight modes pinball games set in between the levels and three

1768
01:51:56,520 --> 01:52:05,240
player isometric racing but it just didn't happen there were prototypes that were out for location

1769
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:12,040
testing but you know what it was going against at the time Street Fighter 2 and that was also in

1770
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:17,880
testing at the time so yeah so they went off of that and went to guardians of the hood instead

1771
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:23,400
which is a beat-em-up game but there are the prototypes exist and you can find I'm sure you

1772
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:32,600
can find ROMs of them so I would love to see what people think about it but as far as I mean that

1773
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:37,280
goes there were some spiritual successors to I mean I said you know super monkey ball kind of doing

1774
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:44,400
the successor thing there were there was a Archer McLean's Mercury switch ball never ball marble

1775
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:50,760
blast gold that's on Linux and Mac OS and Windows it came out in 2003 balance and I'm thinking that

1776
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:58,200
because there's two elves in it just a different one so but nothing is the original nothing will

1777
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:04,440
piss you off and make you hit nothing will make you love you love a trackball and respect the

1778
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:09,800
trackball oh fuck yeah this this game is damn near impossible without a trackball I mean that's just

1779
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:15,520
how it is so yeah marble madness but you have to play the level 2 music for me because I just

1780
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:23,600
played it like five times yeah but I was talking you had so much to say about the game seriously

1781
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:27,840
like my favorite music and are you happy now I'll tell you the other thing I really like about this

1782
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:34,000
is that it reminds me of Wendy what's-her-name that did the Tron music oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

1783
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,920
because I've always loved that synth style just that them since exactly I love it so much so this

1784
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:51,240
why can't I remember her last name now Wendy does it start with an O um Wendy Carlos Wendy Carlos

1785
01:53:51,240 --> 01:54:00,680
okay it's CEO it's an arched letter um yeah it made me think a lot of Wendy Carlos music well

1786
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:04,400
I mean it came out two years after Tron so I could definitely see they're being influenced

1787
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:08,760
in the music and even that grid style if you notice the colors and some of the levels in

1788
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:15,080
that style it I see some Tron influence so all right there it is your classic game of the week

1789
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:20,600
marble madness definitely a classic and you can certainly find that in collections like I think

1790
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:26,920
that midway game I had on the ps3 for a little bit had that in it but again you know thumbstick

1791
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:33,360
versus trackball not the same sorry to say there's another successor that she didn't mention I'm

1792
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:39,640
pretty sure I even called into all our about this like five years ago because a buddy of

1793
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:44,400
mine had a copy of this and I've never played it since and I really want to called Cora Reimpa

1794
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:54,720
marble mania exclusive you play the game I think it was Mario Galaxy or Mario Galaxy 2 when when

1795
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:58,880
your character jumps on like a big bowling ball and goes down a track what the game tells you to

1796
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:03,320
do is take the wiimote and put the bottom in the palm of your hand and treat it like a you know an

1797
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:10,280
arcade stand of joystick kind of thing Cora Reimba uses that control method exactly and I forgot

1798
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:15,000
about Cora Reimba risingly fun I actually have that dandy I have that game it is totally a

1799
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:21,440
marble madness biting but it's great great I need to play this game again all right well you can if

1800
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:25,480
you want it's right I have like a baseball or something like that yeah a lot of different

1801
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:31,520
little stuff pickle soccer basketball panda yeah they did and they all like different weight and

1802

1810
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:22,840
been a really fun show so far we had Matt Connor on earlier I'm talking about his Kickstarter for

1811
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:29,400
read-only memories and gamer acts and that was a really fun interview we were just talking about

1812
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:33,320
that during the break how that was a lot of fun and also kind of talking about during the break

1813
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:37,760
I know we're getting in one of the stories here it's gonna come up in rapid-fire news but you're

1815
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:45,760
a gym oh yeah Fantasia you were you were saying something about where's that Xbox one game

1816
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,120
Fantasia that was supposed to be out I was actually wondering that exact same thing the other day I

1817
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:54,560
looked at it got delayed to 2014 Fantasia the music evolved from harmonix yeah I was like when

1818
01:56:54,560 --> 01:57:01,320
did that happen just kind of out of the blue I guess yeah I haven't seen anything from Microsoft

1819
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:05,920
on that first a lot of their first party tiles well I should say only one of their first party

1820
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:12,360
tiles actually got delayed as well no really it well it was a connect sports oh yeah yeah

1821
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:15,360
that's right but didn't they get weren't they doing like a demo thing they have a demo thing

1822
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:20,840
going on what Nintendo did with the Wii Sports remake but yeah that's been delayed I think it

1823
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:27,360
was delayed just because there's a big gap in titles coming out like I said you know after this

1824
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:36,760
week you know what week is a couple is a Vita game and a PlayStation 3 title that's been delayed

1825
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:40,640
forever painkiller you know what do what dark soccer is doing do one game a week to help get

1826
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:47,160
caught up on your backlog yep at least you know look at them what a pretty box this is like oh

1827
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:53,320
I've played it look I have a screen capture I'm done well it's even worse because it's all because

1828
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:59,400
I still have PlayStation Plus stuff too I keep bookmarking all this stuff and I'm like ah shit

1829
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:05,360
I have so many games to play well what a great transition into our rapid-fire news tonight

1830
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:09,140
because Loki it sounds like you're gonna get even more pretty soon right yes in fact I was

1831
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:13,940
just checking to see if they had them online but it hasn't been updated yet there are gonna

1832
01:58:13,940 --> 01:58:18,900
try Tuesday yeah there's gonna be some more stuff being added PlayStation Plus for December

1833
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:30,980
including Borderlands 2 and grid 2 those will be coming as well and then on let's see here oh and

1834
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:38,660
dyad is also gonna be coming to play free as well I haven't died I remember hearing about the game

1835
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:44,340
but I don't remember what it is exactly but it's supposed to be good and then I think that was the

1836
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:52,580
one that's supposed to be sort of like like geometry Wars maybe I'm trying to look it up

1837
01:58:52,580 --> 01:58:59,820
real quick because it's one psychedelic racer it sounds familiar to me too it's a tunnel racing

1838
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:04,660
puzzle shooting game is what they call it okay well then it's nothing like geometry Wars it

1839
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:09,260
sounds cool though I like that description I'll check that out ah then for Vita Sonic and all

1840
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:18,620
or Sonic and all-stars racing transform for the Vita and urban trial freestyle pretty awesome so

1841
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:28,660
that's coming out and then to be fair I think on the Xbox Friday no it Gears of War is gonna be one

1842
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:34,140
of the free games I don't remember the Xbox Live Arcade title that's also with that though

1843
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:47,420
but yeah Gears of War one coming and then Saints Row 4 getting some DLC pretty soon actually I

1844
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:54,180
think next week or on the 11th and they're gonna have to save Santa Claus from the simulation so

1845
01:59:54,180 --> 02:00:00,220
how the Saints save Christmas and then we'll come with the course as I predicted a Christmas themed

1846
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:12,380
dubstep gun and then a bunch of other you know things reindeer jingle bells jingle so pretty

1847
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:20,820
much yeah it's part of the season pass or $6.99 if you wait until December I will have you know

1848
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:26,100
though if you do buy the season pass I think right now it's on sale for 66% off it's like

1849
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:33,300
five bucks right now or you know on Steam so it might be worth picking up if you're curious I

1850
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:45,260
guess okay Jason I got it you ready you ready come they told me pa wub wub wub huh that's good

1851
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:52,540
that was good I'm gonna put out an album sort of God wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub

1852
02:00:53,260 --> 02:01:02,860
and then some great news and definitely coming very soon in December we will see the final

1853
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:09,860
PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto game coming to mobile Grand Theft Auto San Andreas getting an

1854
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:17,860
improved I believe it like slightly HD version that'll be coming out not sure when but sometime

1855
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:24,220
this month supposed to be on iOS and Android and Windows mobile of course limited devices

1856
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:28,500
are gonna be able to run it but fuck man San Andreas is like one of the best PlayStation 2

1857
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:34,740
era Grand Theft Auto games and that's just all sorts of awesome now I hope that that means now

1858
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:39,780
that they have all these sort of HD a fied Grand Theft Auto games that we get some sort of triple

1859
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:46,100
pack for like Xbox Live arcade or something like that that would be amazing because it fucking

1860
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:55,340
sucks to play those games on using the touchscreen although Grand Theft Auto Vice City in think three

1861
02:01:55,340 --> 02:02:00,420
did run on the Uya so you may be able to sideload this on the Uya which then you'll have like a

1862
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:10,620
PlayStation 2 sort of oh all right moving on some more stories here I know we had a lot of persona

1863
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:15,140
news last week because you know they're teasing persona 5 and so forth but who cares about that

1864
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:20,220
when there's persona for dancing all night that's right the persona music action game that's the

1865
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:26,140
one you're most excited about let's get real it is being developed by Atlas and the co-developer

1866
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:34,460
of Hatsune Miku project diva dingo awesome the game will take place after persona for the Ultimax

1867
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:40,660
ultra suplex hold and Tetsuya Kimura and Daisuke Asakura and some other musicians will be doing

1868
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:44,740
the background music for the game some of the games in the game will include pursuing my true

1869
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:49,780
self heaven reach out to the truth time to make history and true story which were all songs that

1870
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:55,420
were in persona 4 and persona 4 golden so awesome now the song list is starting to take shape so I

1871
02:02:55,420 --> 02:03:00,860
know you persona fans and you music game fans are gonna be in heaven with that if you like your

1872
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:08,180
classic games like me you're probably excited to hear about this jump man I well ironically one of

1873
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:13,100
the games I or the game I did for my very totally because you did that I know right right my first

1874
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:17,500
let's remember video we'll get this the game developer apparently resurrecting jump man is

1875
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:25,660
located in Wichita where Shane Alinko is mind blown something gaming is happening in Wichita go

1876
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:32,260
figure but yeah which I game developers name is Davis sickman jr. now he raised he's raising some

1877
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:38,820
money with a Kickstarter to try to revive the jump man games for iPhone iPad Android PC Mac and

1878
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:45,140
Ouya so that's pretty cool jump man of course originally created by Randy Glover for the Atari

1879
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:51,500
and the old-school PCs and Commodore 64 the initial version had 30 levels and so on and so

1880
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:57,980
on so yeah that would be cool there was a jump man resurrection project planned around 2000 when

1881
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:03,040
they secured the rights to do sequels but it didn't really come to be I guess there was jump

1882
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:07,980
man 2049 but it didn't it didn't really happen but thanks to Kickstarter jump man forever

1883
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:14,620
could be a thing nothing ever works out 2049 what if they did a crossover game that was doodle

1884
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:20,700
jump man there's there's potential you never know all right you know there's a lot of potential in

1885
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:26,100
the awesome game typing of the dead overkill heck yes this game is a lot of fun I played it again

1886
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:33,060
with speaking of Shane in Wichita played this online this past week and the one thing we didn't

1887
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:38,260
get to do unfortunately was try the brand new DLC that was released this week the Shakespeare DLC

1888
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:45,020
pack that's right for $3 you can get all the typing in the game changed to lines as to thine

1889
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:52,300
oh self quintessence of dust and bellows mender so you can you can actually type we get the line

1890
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:56,620
about the bunghole from Hamlet anything is possible dark soccer you know what a bunghole

1891
02:04:56,620 --> 02:05:03,980
is right for real no I I have heard it in the Shakespearean context yeah it is the hole on a

1892
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:12,220
keg mm-hmm now you know as opposed to the hole on your keg anyway uh-huh that's all I got dark

1893
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:21,660
Sakura dang it I was actually looking at the email um well there is a website now open for

1894
02:05:21,740 --> 02:05:27,300
the Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary so you can go look at it I'm sure you can just hunt it down by

1895
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:34,100
going to work you know looking up Virtua Fighter 20th anniversary site but it has some teasing on

1896
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:46,860
there too what could it be we don't know moving forward um Atlas is basically free to look at

1897
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:52,600
any of Sega's old IPs any of their dormant ones so you know that could be Panzer Dragoon that could

1898
02:05:52,600 --> 02:06:02,340
be Jet Set Radio that could be Shenmue so who knows or it could just be Streets of Rage by the

1899
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:07,620
way there's that silver lining I mentioned earlier yeah Shenmue they should make a spin-off game where

1900
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:17,580
the main character is a cow and they call it Shenmue okay so and then now this I actually sat

1901
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:23,820
and watch freaking footage from his two hours watching this thing today and this one I'm gonna

1902
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:31,140
go ahead and just give the link to this is on shoryuken.com Ultra Street Fighter IV

1903
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:41,980
is at Super Arcade in Walnut California and it is basically location testing but there is a two

1904
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:48,740
hour just play of some of the different characters that are in it we have T-Hawk we have Rolando we

1905
02:06:48,740 --> 02:06:58,260
have Elena, Makoto and Poison I was very actually very happily surprised at just how much more

1906
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:05,340
balanced some of the gameplay seems in it but you can watch the footage there's link following

1907
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:14,740
from shoryuken.com so go look at it all right awesome lots of I would I would think this would

1908
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:18,540
be a dead period for gaming news but we still got a lot of good stuff going on out there let's get

1909
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:31,140
to the foogle question of the week you take Facebook and you take Google Plus you slam those

1910
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:35,660
words together you get boogle and it's our foogle question of the week posted on both our communities

1911
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:40,740
over at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and our Google Plus community at google.com slash

1912
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:45,820
plus orange lounge radio all one word or you know what if you put orange lounge radio on Google

1913
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:51,780
you'll find it it comes right up anyway um I'm only gonna be able to read a couple I'm trying to

1914
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:55,780
buy us back some time since our interview went long but with great reason it was great interview

1915
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:59,620
but I'm gonna try to buy back some time here so I'm not gonna read a lot of answers but I really

1916
02:07:59,620 --> 02:08:04,060
want to encourage you to read because there were some great answers to this so here it is earlier

1917
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:10,340
this week one popular web blog for Apple fans made the claim quote while the previous game console

1918
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:15,060
generation was all about motion controls it's clear that the new machines will use second

1919
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:20,700
functionality and apps as major weapons of war and that was a quote from the unofficial Apple

1920
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:27,460
web blog or tuaw.com now that all the triple-a players are on the field what do you feel was

1921
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:32,220
the majority theme of the last generation what might the theme of the next generation be more

1922
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:39,560
motion second screens VR AR more 3d and so on and fact you guys may not have known this question

1923
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:43,540
today coming from Jason actually invented this question Jason you want to elaborate on this at

1924
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:48,860
all before I read some of the answers um just nothing nothing terribly to elaborate on I just

1925
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:53,280
don't think that second screen is gonna wind up making any sort of a significant dent I think the

1926
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:58,940
apps are getting better and they're going to exist but as far as that being as far as that being this

1927
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:04,660
year's motion that's not gonna be nearly all it's cracked up to be all right well let's look at some

1928
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:09,100
of the answers again I've really got to abbreviate this tonight please please please go read the

1929
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:13,520
responses in focus are some great ones including this one on Google Plus from Colin M who says

1930
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:20,480
last-gen felt like the me to generation the we introduced motion controls and Sony was like me

1931
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:25,680
too with the six axis Microsoft at least tried something new with the Kinect I think that I just

1932
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:32,040
gotta say I really like that answer because I mean for real because I mean I haven't read the second

1933
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:38,120
half yet but I was like you know what damn if that ain't right it does feel like everybody was kind

1934
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:42,440
of stealing the good ideas from each other not necessarily a bad thing that's just competition

1935
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:50,720
but you'd like I I couldn't I couldn't go back to like even the PlayStation one and Sega's you

1936
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:55,640
know Saturn Aaron and and talk about like that was a me to generation it really wasn't optical

1937
02:09:55,640 --> 02:10:00,280
media yeah I mean but that that who a new format which is that's not really above and better of all

1938
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:06,320
the cartridges ever that's not me too in the way that that e3 a couple years ago when they debuted

1939
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:10,680
the Kinect and the Sony move you're sitting there going wow they're just they're just after

1940
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:15,600
Nintendo's weave aren't they so you know is very interesting anyway let me read the rest of Colin's

1941
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:20,200
answer here on Google Plus I think the defining feature of this new gen will be social interaction

1942
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:25,720
both the Xbox one and PlayStation 4 have activity feeds a la Facebook to show you what your friends

1943
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:30,880
are doing even the Wii U has that Plaza of sorts then they're sharing videos of the games and live

1944
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:35,400
streaming seamless multiplayer experiences such as watchdogs will blur the line between single

1945
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:41,360
player and multiplayer gaming this next gen will be all about other people Jason you made a motion

1946
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:46,240
like I agree that sir that's exactly what my prediction for this generation is gonna be is

1947
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:54,560
that last year was better graphics denser media mostly and motion controls yes and and except in

1948
02:10:54,560 --> 02:11:00,440
the case of we mostly cementing the online marketplace and online interactivity there is

1949
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:08,920
I have a very strong feeling that this generation also in PC land is going to be not just developing

1950
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:15,960
a title updating it and moving on but it's going to be social more socially geared with your friends

1951
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:23,080
but also gaming communities do you know how much new Borderlands 2 content that it there is do you

1952
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:29,440
know how much new Diablo content there is there's like all of these games are geared with the

1953
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:35,760
ability of with the capability of tacking new content on continuously in my opinion micro tracks

1954
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:40,680
and microtransactions be damned it's kind of a really good thing because they're going to extend

1955
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:45,680
the lives of games and keep changing it in significant ways all right let's go to one more

1956
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:50,920
answer from Google Plus from Travis H who says 3d makes my head hurt motion control frustrates

1957
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:55,840
me it makes me break a sweat I'm almost positive VR would make me throw up so let's stick to buttons

1958
02:11:55,840 --> 02:12:00,160
gripping and movie quality storylines and gameplay that pushes the limits of what we have already

1959
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:05,840
seen or felt so far as for second screen bring it on I love how well the Vita and ps3 play together

1960
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:10,680
can't wait to get my ps4 love my Wii U and the new PlayStation app they added is a great step

1961
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:15,680
in the right direction for Sony so instead of mobile's attempt to take over consoles let's

1962
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:22,320
make a baby and I'll get along so that is Travis's prediction for you let's make a baby and I'll get

1963
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:27,200
along love it those answers from Google Plus but there's about six other answers there if you want

1964
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:35,280
to check that out we can call it the X for you going to Facebook let's read some answers here

1965
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:39,480
on Facebook you know I I might be being partial here but I really like this answer from extra firm

1966
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:45,040
our buddy from courthouse extra over on Facebook says I think smartphone integration is definitely

1967
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:49,920
the theme of this console generation whether it's second screen experience or having companion apps

1968
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,120
for your games I think that's what it's about heck even Nintendo has branched out and made

1969
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:59,000
Miiverse available on smartphones I think this is the major companies doing their part to not

1970
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:04,620
compete with mobile phones but to show that they can adapt to them let's make a baby right let's

1971
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:10,400
read another answer here from Ricardo V who says I don't think the last generation was about motion

1972
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:14,960
controls maybe the marketing makes it look that way because it was the new thing but at the end

1973
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:20,160
I think it was more about giving a cinematic feel to games lots of scripted events animations of

1974
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:24,240
characters with the environment issue played etcetera clear examples of that are games like

1975
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:29,840
Uncharted The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite I still don't have a new console but I think we

1976
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:34,720
started seeing what the new gen is about in the previous gen integration of indie games into the

1977
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:41,600
consoles multitasking and cloud and digital content good answer I like I like that too and

1978
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:47,480
certainly even though I think you saw it a little bit with PlayStation 2 just that when you talk

1979
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:51,320
about cinematic feel like certainly the budgets are starting to get up there where it's like you

1980
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:55,720
are but you're making three movies when you make a video game you know just just with what goes into

1981
02:13:55,720 --> 02:14:00,880
it so I I definitely think that took off and especially those games you cited there let's do

1982
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:06,440
one more answer from Facebook I'm gonna do this one from Andy R who said I think the theme of this

1983
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:11,320
generation will be connectivity by that I mean games that might have been mostly single-player

1984
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:16,240
games in the past that are now offering incentive to connect to the internet to evolve the game

1985
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:22,520
world we saw the beginnings of it with games like Dark Souls or Demon Souls or Journey we're playing

1986
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:27,480
the game online could change or enhance the gameplay experience now with games like Watch Dogs

1987
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:33,040
or destiny the theme seems to be continuing again those are some of the answers from Facebook and

1988
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:37,080
Google Plus please check out all the great diverse answers and it's never too late to add your own

1989
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:41,960
as well it's not like we close it down and and we read pretty much everything that's posted at

1990
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:46,320
least to ourselves and we like seeing the diverse opinions and see what comes back on the show later

1991
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:50,480
that later on we're gonna get back into some long-form news but if you have more thoughts

1992
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:56,240
on this topic mailbag at orange laundry comms a great place to send it to Loki I was gonna say

1993
02:14:56,240 --> 02:15:00,640
also yeah I definitely don't think motion control was I think problem with motion control and this

1994
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:05,840
is even gonna be something going into next-gen with connect and stuff is just it's a gimmick

1995
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:14,360
it's just like remember when they had the vision camera yeah it's a gimmick that sold more copies

1996
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:19,760
of Wii Sports than any other video I'm not saying that we did it wrong we had the right idea because

1997
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:24,200
their whole console is based on that in the beginning and you know that was fine and that

1998
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:30,960
worked I'm talking about the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 it did not work it was a fad and I

1999
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:35,760
honestly think did you just make a pro Nintendo statement versus the other two I've always said

2000
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:42,840
just I'm just saying it's just funny anyways um so I think the same to me you said with the second

2001
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:46,800
screen stuff is I think it's just a big old gimmick that you know it's definitely something

2002
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:51,200
Microsoft's pushing because they want that second screen to be a fucking surface you know so of

2003
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:56,720
course they're gonna try to push that or a Windows Phone or some shit I just don't think it's

2004
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:00,800
something that we're gonna see implemented well into games you may get a couple games that

2005
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:04,760
implement it well but aside from that I mean it's just like what they've done to connect its voice

2006
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:11,680
commands for shit or it's FIFA detecting that you're cursing so they can fly you why the fuck

2007
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:20,640
would you want that I just don't know why anyone would want that anyways um okay so let's talk a

2008
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:26,280
little bit about the Xbox one since I mentioned connect you may remember last week we talked a

2009
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:32,080
little bit about how the Xbox one had some issues with some of the consoles that hey there was disk

2010
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:36,920
drive sounding like that it was shredding the disk you know at least that's what it sounded like

2011
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:42,200
and it was an issue and I said you know they really should come out and address the issue

2012
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:46,240
and figure out a way to you know piece customers and so that so that's what they did they went

2013
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:50,880
ahead and said you know what they're gonna replace the console what's kind of great about it is if

2014
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:56,760
you call in and say hey you know my consoles all fucked up what they're gonna do is give you a free

2015
02:16:56,760 --> 02:17:02,880
digital version of one the Xbox one launch title so either forza rice in a room dead rising three

2016
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:09,560
or zoo tycoon and you get to keep your console until the replacement console arrives and you

2017
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:16,120
send the replacement console back so I thought that's a pretty decent way to make up for those

2018
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:21,840
drive issues and I haven't heard too much more about it this week so I'm assuming that it was

2019
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:28,040
indeed a very small number of consoles that were affected by it well thank God that it's not so

2020
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:33,560
widespread because I think that they learned the lesson the last time yeah they think I want to

2021
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:40,240
make that mistake again yeah no kidding well this could get very interesting could EA be working on

2022
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:45,680
an open-world Star Wars game so what yeah some recent job listings apparently point to this which

2023
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:50,320
of course makes me raise an eyebrow and go but I thought they already had a Star Wars MMO called

2024
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:56,800
the Old Republic but perhaps something new to tie in with the new games or maybe not even necessarily

2025
02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:03,320
an MMO but an animation director being hired for EA Canada for quote a major new next-gen

2026
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:08,960
open-world action game in a beloved sci-fi property sounds like battle friend to me you

2027
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:13,960
maybe hmm there's also an executive producer British position in a lead combat designer

2028
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:19,340
position which apparently was also linked to a Star Wars property because a recruiter said

2029
02:18:19,380 --> 02:18:25,420
something on Twitter I don't know but anyway apparently this goes back to when avalanche

2030
02:18:25,420 --> 02:18:31,180
studios was working with Lucas are almost signed up with Lucas arts to do an open-world Star Wars

2031
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:38,020
game around 2007 oh my god that would have been so amazing and then you guys remember Star Wars 1313

2032
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:42,620
that was something that was Disney candidate if you didn't know Disney closed developer that

2033
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:47,380
halted the game could that be the game that's being picked up and continued question mark who

2034
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:53,100
knows EA of course has the exclusive rights to develop and continue the Star Wars games so I'm

2035
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:59,500
sure something will happen by December 2015 when the new Star Wars movie comes out guaranteed you

2036
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:04,380
know avalanche is the company behind just cause which may know very exciting and they also have

2037
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:10,380
them a new Mad Max game coming out so that oh you very awesome I liked the trailer for that they

2038
02:19:10,380 --> 02:19:16,580
know how to make a good multiplayer game or new open-world game so it's it's December 2013 now so

2039
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:21,780
you got two years to make it happen it sounds like they already got started so we'll see what

2040
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:28,100
happens don't make me feel older just think about how old we're gonna be when the new Star Wars movie

2041
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:32,700
finally comes out the Warcraft movie you know what is next year huh my 20th high school reunion oh

2042
02:19:32,700 --> 02:19:39,620
my gosh Wow so are you gonna go if someone gives me $400 for the plane ticket yeah I'm gonna try

2043
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:46,740
to my ten-year reunion was practically just downtown where I go all the time didn't go yeah

2044
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:51,740
well you're not from another state right I'm not but I'm just saying I just anybody my ten-year

2045
02:19:51,740 --> 02:19:56,420
reunion was crap I don't think we had one for mine if we did I didn't care most people I want

2046
02:19:56,420 --> 02:20:01,140
to keep in touch with I'm I still talk to on Facebook it was yeah I actually keep up with

2047
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:06,300
those people some of those people now on Facebook and I'm like you have kids I have a cat there

2048
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:11,460
would love my cat there is high school was such a bad time in some ways it was good in some ways

2049
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:15,780
it's bad I want to make it sound like poor me because we all had bad experiences I'm sure but

2050
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:20,940
there's just some people from high school I would really love to go my entire life and just never

2051
02:20:20,940 --> 02:20:26,140
see again and that would be I would be very happy with that I can sympathize with that I just want

2052
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:33,940
to bring Dan and have Dan and then like leave early like I did for homecoming my senior year

2053
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:42,220
like bye this place sucks hey don't have a story do you yes you do well how about some wow news is

2054
02:20:42,220 --> 02:20:50,060
you know we've got oh my god space goats coast to coast I know but I'm not playing it because I

2055
02:20:50,060 --> 02:20:56,380
promised I wasn't gonna get it but their lead designer sorry the lead system designer Greg

2056
02:20:56,380 --> 02:21:02,340
Street left Blizzard he said bye I'm gone actually what he said is that and this is a quote I've been

2057
02:21:02,380 --> 02:21:06,980
at Blizzard Entertainment for almost six years it has been epic and I have made many friends

2058
02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:11,100
around the world and I've learned so much but I have a great opportunity for something new and

2059
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:17,380
exciting sadly it is time to move on he's also going to oculus right now no we don't know there's

2060
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:22,500
a lot of now there's a lot of tinfoil I mean being on the Horde house I talked to a lot of

2061
02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:27,380
Warcraft people there's some tinfoil hats in the community that he possibly went to riot games

2062
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:32,860
maker of League of Legends also in LA this is based on a total conspiracy theory about who he

2063
02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:39,820
follows on Twitter which is interesting um but I but I mean if he quit Warcraft to go to League

2064
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:45,340
of Legends he'd just be like everybody else yeah but I'm pumped which is strange blizzards new one

2065
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:51,340
is coming now yeah but the funny part is that it's not funny I know all right I just like well you

2066
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:56,660
know what people go and you know people moving from company to company usually isn't news but

2067
02:21:56,660 --> 02:22:02,240
the thing about World of Warcraft man quasi quasi related question to that comment did

2068
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:07,020
your conspiracy theories come from people in California or outside of California all over

2069
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:13,020
they come from the internet where well it's it's a meaningful question to me because my my

2070
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:18,460
co-workers those that have lived in the Bay Area you know the better part of their lives have a

2071
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:24,140
lot of friends at a lot of companies either personally or professionally including our

2072
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:30,620
competitors and everything else and you know yeah yeah have has competitors I didn't know

2073
02:22:30,620 --> 02:22:37,580
it kind of thought they did their own thing very much no oh there are the detail is the the depth

2074
02:22:37,580 --> 02:22:42,540
is infinite it's you know everybody everybody has the this is better this is worse has the

2075
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:49,220
confrontational aspect of it and sure that exists at a professional level as well but it's not maybe

2076
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:56,420
I shouldn't rip back the veil but it's not like death death threats and and at odds ends with

2077
02:22:56,420 --> 02:23:03,380
each other I mean we just had a charity dodgeball game where our best friends at competing companies

2078
02:23:03,380 --> 02:23:08,380
came out for a good cause as well we do whenever we throw drink ups people from all of these

2079
02:23:08,380 --> 02:23:15,700
companies come out it's not yeah professionally the it's it's competition but that's healthy and

2080
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:21,620
the people that make it up are good people you know for the short time that I interned at a

2081
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:27,620
local TV news station as I was going to be just like Ron Burgundy one day and here here I am but

2082
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:31,580
I interned in a local TV station and they would about once every three months there would be a

2083
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:36,980
big get-together of all the local news people from all like NBC CBS all of them would just go

2084
02:23:36,980 --> 02:23:42,740
have dinner like it's not they all hated each other because a lot of times and especially look

2085
02:23:42,740 --> 02:23:47,340
at your own local TV news they trade people all the time and people go to jobs to the companies

2086
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:52,700
and it just you know something that happens yeah we that this this is industry this is why they're

2087
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:57,820
there's conventions professional conventions where all of these same people talk discuss and meet all

2088
02:23:57,820 --> 02:24:02,900
the rest of these people and it's also why you don't truly have companies that just bicker back

2089
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:07,140
and forth in the same industry and are just like at odds ends with people it's I don't know it's

2090
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:12,660
interesting it's interesting insight for me to have now as well let's move on with more stories

2091
02:24:12,660 --> 02:24:19,620
Loki all right so you know one of the first things of course to come out of a tragedy like Sandy

2092
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:27,020
Hook was let's blame Pete you know video games because obviously this person had video games

2093
02:24:27,020 --> 02:24:32,500
played video games clearly video games must have caused it you know because we could also draw that

2094
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:38,300
conclusion to food food must cause this because he eats food therefore you know food caused murder

2095
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:46,700
anyway so there was a report that was done you know showing all the different games you played

2096
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:55,620
and stuff and unfortunately even though you know with that profile everything it just it didn't tie

2097
02:24:55,620 --> 02:25:02,300
with the games at all it said he played video games often both solo home and online they can

2098
02:25:02,300 --> 02:25:08,180
be described as both violent and nonviolent one person described the shooter as spending the

2099
02:25:08,620 --> 02:25:14,220
of his time playing non-violent video games all day with one of his favorites at one point being

2100
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:20,420
Super Mario but there you go Super Mario Bros. causes mass murder well there was a let's go I'll

2101
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:25,100
let you finish cuz I'm about to drag a bit it's the shadow people that live on top of the cliff

2102
02:25:25,100 --> 02:25:31,380
and I'm about to drag a bit in conclusion you know what we do know is the shooter had significant

2103
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:35,580
mental health issues while now affecting the criminality of the shooters mental state for

2104
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:40,900
their crimes or his criminal responsibility for him did affect his ability to live a normal life

2105
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:47,780
interact with others whom he should have been close with and you know video games did not play

2106
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:57,620
a part in that so yeah and it's funny as even though after that came out of course the NRA

2107
02:25:57,620 --> 02:26:04,980
issued a statement blaming still are actually no I'm sorry that this is referring back to the the

2108
02:26:04,980 --> 02:26:11,060
original thing where the NRA blamed it of course no traction on that you know no retraction from

2109
02:26:11,060 --> 02:26:18,140
the NRA about being wrong or anything as they usually are I was looking at Twitter this week

2110
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:22,940
as I usually do during the day and I saw a link and I made the mistake of clicking on it even

2111
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:27,980
though I saw the name Kotaku in the URL and my eyes rolled so far to the back of my head I could

2112
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:33,660
see my fucking brain because they ran a story about how the Sandy Hook shooter his favorite

2113
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:39,100
game was dance dance revolution and this guy played DDR all the time and dah dah dah dah and

2114
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:46,860
all I could really think of like I was just like Kotaku please shut the fuck up please please shut

2115
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:51,860
up I I saw these links I didn't read the article surely they were making it tongue-in-cheek and

2116
02:26:51,860 --> 02:26:57,340
making the same point that we are which I'm just sitting here going why are you perpetuating this

2117
02:26:57,340 --> 02:27:02,860
whole I mean it's it's kind of irresponsible it's clearly clickbait it's clearly this whole

2118
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:07,900
let's and I'm not even saying this because I played DDR for years and years because unlike

2119
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:15,420
what you do when you run a story like this I don't give this shit any credit at all clearly

2120
02:27:15,420 --> 02:27:19,740
and even the professionals have now said the video games had nothing to do with it and you

2121
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:25,020
know what happened obviously was a huge tragedy let's not forget I mean had just how awful and

2122
02:27:25,020 --> 02:27:31,500
fucked up what this guy did was people want to blame something for it the unfortunate reality

2123
02:27:31,620 --> 02:27:40,700
is there may not be anything we can blame but evil mental health there's that too I mean that's I get

2124
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:45,500
that speculation you know I mean it's just so with the state of I hate to go into the politics

2125
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:51,860
of it you know but we don't give enough attention to mental health I there is no background checks

2126
02:27:51,860 --> 02:27:56,740
there's definitely a lot of stigma with that and and we we have to break down those walls a lot and

2127
02:27:56,740 --> 02:28:03,140
I would agree with you there that you know clearly he had issues that weren't being addressed I don't

2128
02:28:03,140 --> 02:28:08,260
know trying to beat those nine footers might frustrate someone into no I'm serious but yeah

2129
02:28:08,260 --> 02:28:17,500
so anyway I'm just saying the ban on that website continues and you know shame on me for being dumb

2130
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:23,180
enough to click a link like that but I was just like no no they could oh my god every so often

2131
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:27,420
you have to confirm that yes they're stupid yeah it's just kind of one of those like Lord get a

2132
02:28:27,420 --> 02:28:35,420
look anyhow let's see going to our chat room at live dot vog network comm SSJ 100 Matt says

2133
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:45,860
basically this report answered no questions let's see a coup the peggle pervert says see how and

2134
02:28:46,180 --> 02:28:53,980
oh Lord all right uh let's move on more stories and I will go next well you remember also to the

2135
02:28:53,980 --> 02:29:00,540
people used to blame D&D on making people be devil worshippers yes and Mike when my mom found out I

2136
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:05,340
played D&D in high school she like threw a fit because she thought it was devil worship well my

2137
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:09,300
grandma did the same thing so when I'd go play D&D at my friend Derek's house I'd be by we're all

2138
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:14,740
for our weekly chicken sacrifice Rob right you are not we're seeing them worshipping the devil

2139
02:29:14,740 --> 02:29:20,500
are you Rob that way you do that's what they said on Oprah Rob Rob do don't play Dungeons & Dragons

2140
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:30,300
Rob that's what it was like they said on the 700 Club that watch that shit so I don't even know

2141
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:34,620
how they got bored by the way you or when they started caring if I worship did you hear that

2142
02:29:34,620 --> 02:29:39,780
the guy that started the Trinity Broadcasting Network died no I didn't yeah he died yesterday

2143
02:29:39,780 --> 02:29:45,100
that Fast and Furious dude too but yeah I was gonna say all I all I heard about on Facebook

2144
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:49,340
was the guy from Fast and the Furious yeah but that guy died too and no one cared well because

2145
02:29:49,340 --> 02:29:54,740
I'm not gonna fit I'm not I'm not even gonna finish my thought or I'm gonna be a bad person

2146
02:29:54,740 --> 02:30:02,340
so I'm just gonna bite my tongue and talk about the PlayStation 4 hey and well here's the thing

2147
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:07,780
about the PlayStation 4 it may not last long hold on hold on I'm not trolling here's the thing there

2148
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:14,740
was a comment from Sony UK pop UK boss Fergal Gara because of course the PlayStation just

2149
02:30:14,740 --> 02:30:19,300
launched in the UK this week there's a lot of stuff in the media over there this week and

2150
02:30:19,300 --> 02:30:23,900
Fergal Gara made a very interesting comment saying quote I think there's reasons to believe that the

2151
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:29,220
next cycle might be shorter in markets such as the UK it's probably a sign of the times and how much

2152
02:30:29,220 --> 02:30:32,940
has changed in seven years but I think the willingness and the appetite to pick up new

2153
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:37,940
technology fast has probably changed quite a bit so all this coming down to will the ps4 be a

2154
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:45,100
10-year lifecycle maybe not horseshit please I and this is this is going back to the question

2155
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:50,860
of the week and this is a question I've had in my mind for a very long time as far as a new console

2156
02:30:50,860 --> 02:30:56,820
a new technology a new technology and an overhaul what the hell else are they gonna do the video

2157
02:30:56,820 --> 02:31:01,300
game the quality the visual aspect and quality of video games has improved dramatically and

2158
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:06,980
considering that every you know unless everybody box on 4k and rolls that into a new technology

2159
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:12,700
there's no that you know there's no visual dramatic changes that they can make you know in the next

2160
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:18,580
five Jason I want to say yes but I when I was 12 years old and saw Super Nintendo mode 7 for the

2161
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:25,140
first time I was like it's so fucking real it'll never get more real than that oh my god but so

2162
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:32,940
cool but that is a terrible comparison that is fuck you do because no well no the quality

2163
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:39,180
standard is cinema slash real life and one step closer to the holodeck Jason that's what we always

2164
02:31:39,180 --> 02:31:43,860
say on the show every console is one step closer to the but but that would be a different technology

2165
02:31:43,860 --> 02:31:47,660
that's not just a graphical improvement which is what I'm claiming right now but there's nothing

2166
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:53,660
that can take that mantle in the next generation to make the ps4 is timeline a lifecycle be less

2167
02:31:53,660 --> 02:32:02,060
than for you like or soft lightroom Jason it's gonna holodeck you all listen it the difference

2168
02:32:02,060 --> 02:32:09,220
would be moving from a you can't I don't really think you can use the holodeck as a graphical

2169
02:32:09,220 --> 02:32:12,980
comparison because this is what I'm saying one step closer Jamie we're not gonna be at the

2170
02:32:12,980 --> 02:32:19,780
holodeck the next generation there'll be awesome if we were more apt comparison would be shut up

2171
02:32:19,780 --> 02:32:27,980
would be leaving your monitor for a holographic interface well that's what they have in the

2172
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:37,700
Hunger Games that was the correct reaction the endgame can only be one I didn't break the mic

2173
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:44,060
listen the endgame can only be one thing and that's where the boobies become real and you

2174
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:50,220
put your penis in it that is really the endgame that anyone can expect because where do you need

2175
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:56,580
to go beyond that not nowhere you know everybody is interested in that thank you I understand that

2176
02:32:56,580 --> 02:33:02,860
but that's gonna be the endgame I want fluffy kitties I want to be able to pet the kitties in

2177
02:33:02,860 --> 02:33:08,900
the game as do I but I'm just there will be a switch there will be pussy there will there will

2178
02:33:08,900 --> 02:33:14,220
be a switch just like on the old Atari 2600 game select there will be booby and kitty and then of

2179
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:23,620
course you know and ferret mode moving on all right that's the show 100 Matt and chat says

2180
02:33:23,620 --> 02:33:29,540
one step closer to the edge and it's about to break just like this show we've been one step to

2181
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:35,620
the edge since episode three okay and I wasn't even here dark soccer I was I was sleeping in a

2182
02:33:35,620 --> 02:33:44,940
closet real story damn it you know what Rob pet the pussy she came out for a little bit I was

2183
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:52,860
surprised now this is one thing that is super cool if we can get away from the bullshittery

2184
02:33:52,860 --> 02:34:02,940
of you know fake reporting and all the gun violence and and pussies everybody those two

2185
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:08,700
last statements do go well together you have whatever I was trying to tie it in but I'm so

2186
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:13,820
flustered right now because of the Cyber Monday event for Rosetta Stone ad that's on this page

2187
02:34:13,820 --> 02:34:20,420
no seriously um there are a team of neuroscientists at the University of Pennsylvania and Friedberg

2188
02:34:20,420 --> 02:34:28,180
University that are using video games where people go through virtual towns basically just

2189
02:34:28,180 --> 02:34:33,100
delivering oh you know they're using fucking Animal Crossing but I mean they're going around

2190
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:37,820
and delivering stuff in these in these locations in the game but they're looking at how the brain

2191
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:48,500
encodes spatial information to form I guess location tags for memories and basically there's

2192
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:52,500
actually a mental technique I don't know if anyone's ever heard of something called the

2193
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:59,420
mind palace basically where for you to remember certain information you visualize rooms in a

2194
02:34:59,420 --> 02:35:07,740
palace and it's mapping it's using spatial mapping to instead trigger a memory and it sounds like

2195
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:15,220
that this is sort of what they're doing but they're also using this more as a study for epilepsy which

2196
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:22,740
is very interesting they're basically trying to find direct neural evidence that memory that

2197
02:35:22,740 --> 02:35:31,660
basically memory tags information based on where and when they were formed so that you're you

2198
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:38,020
access the memory by remembering that situation and I know for me in particular and I know I

2199
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:44,980
haven't been like overly verbal on this but at the end of January I was diagnosed with autism

2200
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:53,620
in like not I'm gonna go repeat myself a bajillion times and kill people no that doesn't happen the

2201
02:35:53,620 --> 02:36:00,540
whole thing too is that it's actually been how I remember a lot of stuff is by remembering visually

2202
02:36:00,540 --> 02:36:07,300
what where I was what I did I couldn't remember the name of this one shop for the record until I

2203
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:11,540
was standing at IKEA facing the direction that the shop was in and then I remembered the name of it

2204
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:20,180
for example you know so it's it's definitely got a bit of a definite interest I mean we're talking

2205
02:36:20,180 --> 02:36:27,420
about that mind palace technique having been a mental memory building tool that's been in

2206
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:36,500
existence since before the the current era it's been in existence for centuries for thousands of

2207
02:36:36,500 --> 02:36:42,980
years so the fact that they're putting using a video game to actually test how the brain maps

2208
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:48,500
this information and using this technique in a visual manner is I think it's a pretty neat

2209
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:56,260
thing honestly so nice yeah games doing good I appreciate a story like that after the fuckery

2210
02:36:56,260 --> 02:37:01,220
we had a couple stories ago there's another thing too that they were I'm just gonna read this

2211
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:06,180
because it is kind of technical but I'm gonna quote it because it says during navigation neurons

2212
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:11,700
in the hippocampus and neighboring regions can often represent the patient's virtual location

2213
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:16,900
within the town kind of like a brain GPS device these so-called place cells are perhaps the most

2214
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:22,100
striking example of the neuron that encodes an abstract cognitive representation so basically

2215
02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:26,980
where they're visualizing themselves in their game environment is where their mind is visualizing the

2216
02:37:26,980 --> 02:37:34,580
data that they're researching too so again it's there's a tie between how we think what we remember

2217
02:37:35,060 --> 02:37:38,740
and how we access our memories I think it's fantastic that they're doing this and hi scenario

2218
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:44,740
kitty no she's in the living room she's getting a little more friendly during the show it's good

2219
02:37:44,740 --> 02:37:48,980
all right uh anyhow let's move on uh dark sakura is going to open up the mail bag

2220
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:54,900
mailbag at orange laundry.com is the place to send emails and I think it was a little bit lonely in

2221
02:37:54,900 --> 02:37:59,460
there this week but at least there was one right yeah and I think though that some no there was

2222
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:06,740
only one uh so I'll read it um hello oh lorry ease um I have a fairly decent income and the

2223
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:12,340
purchase of both systems really hit my savings hard I can see why most everyone will only get

2224
02:38:12,340 --> 02:38:17,780
one of either the ps4 or the xbox one I think they're both solid and with good games but I'd

2225
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:22,420
like the games on the xbox xbox went a little better I think I can sum up my comparison of

2226
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:26,980
the systems with an analogy the playstation is like someone handing out candy to everyone in

2227
02:38:26,980 --> 02:38:31,300
the form of a roll of mentos the xbox is like someone grabbing handfuls of candy and throwing

2228
02:38:31,300 --> 02:38:39,140
them into a crowd um enjoy and remember to brush your teeth robaba yes sir I'll brush my teeth I

2229
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:45,140
love robaba I I wish I could have been in the situation where I could buy both consoles this

2230
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:49,860
year if I wasn't in debt after my last Disneyland trip I would I'd like to be in the position where

2231
02:38:49,860 --> 02:38:57,860
I can just go to Disneyland soon soon yeah all right uh mailbag at orange laundry.com if you

2232
02:38:57,860 --> 02:39:02,740
want to make some crazy analogies on the show in the future it'd be awesome mailbag at orange

2233
02:39:02,740 --> 02:39:09,860
laundry.com uh now is the part of the show where we get a little bit angry even though you know

2234
02:39:09,860 --> 02:39:15,380
there's been a lot of happy stuff tonight uh we have to balance that with some anger and rar

2235
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:17,140
because FUs of the week

2236
02:39:32,980 --> 02:39:39,780
I am actually not very angry today except for I mean the usual stuff

2237
02:39:40,660 --> 02:39:44,340
so yeah I guess I'm pretty angry not really I'm angry on behalf of Becky

2238
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:49,700
I'm very glad that I did not get hired where she is employed at and I cannot go into

2239
02:39:50,260 --> 02:39:56,180
more detail because I was advised of a lot in confidence but um fuck that place fuck it a lot

2240
02:39:58,260 --> 02:40:06,580
um oh and also fuck bitch face Vicky who was my ex-boss who sold the company to the current place

2241
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:11,940
for um and I heard about this so I again not something I can prove and just nail her ass to

2242
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:16,660
the wall about but for apparently bad mouthing me to the current owner of the company because

2243
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:20,580
she couldn't handle she thinks I was trying to ruin her business you know what if I was trying

2244
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:24,580
to ruin your business it would have been gone before you sold it you didn't change your

2245
02:40:24,580 --> 02:40:30,900
passwords duh all right lucky I figured you're out for not playing Grand Theft Auto 5 yet

2246
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:35,700
it's only $39.99 amazon really on ps3

2247
02:40:38,980 --> 02:40:42,260
FU to Loki for trying to get me to spend more money when I already spent

2248
02:40:42,260 --> 02:40:46,100
too much on goddamn steam sales but at least all the steam games are really good

2249
02:40:46,100 --> 02:40:51,540
I can't be too upset uh Jason I was going to say that I'm happy little bunny this

2250
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:57,140
week and that's mostly true but uh amusingly and perhaps not at all surprisingly enough

2251
02:40:57,140 --> 02:41:04,660
to last week's FU uh I'm having a weird snafu with the uh the parking garage that I'm in right

2252
02:41:04,660 --> 02:41:13,460
now and people are being very silly and blaming me for something I'm sure they there's a dresser

2253
02:41:13,460 --> 02:41:17,780
something at the end of my parking spot and people are telling me to move the extra three inches in

2254
02:41:18,420 --> 02:41:25,300
that dresser is not ours it's not part of our unit so um I need to figure out whose it is so

2255
02:41:25,300 --> 02:41:30,740
I can actually pull in the whole way to the parking lot all right which you know San Francisco

2256
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:35,140
type parking you can understand how being even that much further away from your normal spot

2257
02:41:35,140 --> 02:41:42,900
would be detrimental admittedly parking in San Francisco oh my god terror terror yes all right

2258
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:50,340
FU to terror uh just a couple more stories for you guys Loki speaking of terror Lindsey Lohan

2259
02:41:51,220 --> 02:42:02,020
what segue of the year goes to Lindsey Lohan is now allegedly uh suing Rockstar Games over GTA V

2260
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:08,740
because there is you know the whole game takes place in uh like a Hollywood environment there's

2261
02:42:08,740 --> 02:42:15,460
you know different celebrities and stuff that you run into and you know they act very cliche

2262
02:42:15,460 --> 02:42:20,820
like some of these celebrities might but she thinks that one of those characters is directly

2263
02:42:20,820 --> 02:42:30,660
based off of her good luck with that because um no no don't we have like laws for parody and

2264
02:42:30,660 --> 02:42:35,620
especially if you're a parody public figure not a character that's just exactly her it's it's all

2265
02:42:35,620 --> 02:42:43,060
of the different you know female celebrities that are on the flip side how much do we actually

2266
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:46,660
believe that Lindsey Lohan would be suing a freaking video game I mean really

2267
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:53,780
and besides that parody is protected I just want to make sure this news is coming from Kotaku is it

2268
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:58,500
because it sounds like the type of story they'd write I don't know if it's better or worse

2269
02:43:00,180 --> 02:43:09,220
never mind it's coming from TMZ oh god oh god well it's just probably why everyone doubted the

2270
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:15,060
it's about the same level death reporting yesterday too yeah yeah so all right well

2271
02:43:15,060 --> 02:43:22,340
if TMZ reported it Loki it must be true so yes she's claiming that I love that I'm gonna direct

2272
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:27,700
quote this because of their wording uh claiming that video game honchos jacked her image without

2273
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:36,820
her permission who uses honcho anymore apparently uh somebody does some some TMZ staffer

2274
02:43:37,620 --> 02:43:45,380
well whatever to that good luck Lindsey Lohan and yeah TMZ you're both gonna need it all right uh

2275
02:43:45,380 --> 02:43:49,460
also good luck to all of you that were awaiting this new console this actually sounded really

2276
02:43:49,460 --> 02:43:53,300
awesome and I was looking forward to this I was hoping to maybe pick one up at some point but

2277
02:43:53,300 --> 02:43:59,300
it's gonna have to wait till next year because the retron 5 console or the retro N I think retron's

2278
02:43:59,300 --> 02:44:03,940
better name but retro N or whatever the retro N5 console has been delayed to the first quarter of

2279
02:44:03,940 --> 02:44:08,820
2014 if you did not know what this was this was the this was the system that would play

2280
02:44:08,820 --> 02:44:15,620
Game Boy Advance games Super Nintendo games Genesis games NES games and Famicom games all

2281
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:20,740
in one hence the number five and it had like an HDMI out so it would make it work on newer TVs

2282
02:44:20,740 --> 02:44:27,860
that's uh pretty awesome and uh it's been delayed because of faulty pins discovered in some packaged

2283
02:44:27,860 --> 02:44:32,580
units at least they're doing the right thing and pulling it and fixing the problem as opposed to

2284
02:44:32,580 --> 02:44:37,460
selling some crap units so unfortunately if you were hoping to get one on its release day December

2285
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:45,220
10th too bad you won't all right uh there it is that's it for the news we had uh in our show

would use some of your balls and spread the love around spread my balls all over that sounds like

2306
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:37,780
but just take rob's balls and throw them at everyone to be fair they're not actually my

2307

balls they're grandpa's balls yeah I just I just want you to know you should be thankful

02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:55,540
with your balls hopefully she'll hear it on the podcast feed well it's a good thing they're not

2310
02:46:55,540 --> 02:47:02,420
sweaty balls if you missed if you missed the first part of the show uh grandpa uh matt from

2311
02:47:02,420 --> 02:47:08,500
horde house got a bunch of little hacky sacks with the vog logo and website url printed on them

2312
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:13,780
as giveaways for Blizzcon well he only gave about half of them away so now we're gonna pass them on

2313
02:47:13,780 --> 02:47:19,060
to other vog hosts and so forth uh to hand them out at later conventions so when we talk about

2314
02:47:19,060 --> 02:47:24,580
our balls they are balls and they're kind of squishy they're fun to play with and our balls

2315
02:47:24,580 --> 02:47:29,620
yeah have balls anyhow I'm sure you didn't call in just to talk about balls what is on your mind

2316
02:47:29,620 --> 02:47:37,860
that's what you sorry how do you know I didn't call well surprise me then let's let's let's talk

2317
02:47:37,860 --> 02:47:45,460
balls no no no did not come to talk balls couple things I want to talk about from tonight's uh

2318
02:47:45,460 --> 02:47:52,180
discussion sure now I understand that olr is the place where every person has their voice

2319
02:47:52,180 --> 02:47:59,060
now in response to that one person who wrote in about how you guys are being biased towards one

2320
02:47:59,060 --> 02:48:08,260
console yes shit happens these shit happens yeah I mean on our podcast we talk about different

2321
02:48:08,260 --> 02:48:14,100
things but sometimes we get on one topic or one company for a while and it's like well that's what

2322
02:48:14,100 --> 02:48:19,780
everybody is talking about just because we're talking about it as well that does not mean what

2323
02:48:19,780 --> 02:48:25,700
we're saying is the same as everybody else right and I do want to I do want to remind you it wasn't

2324
02:48:25,700 --> 02:48:33,300
just one person I only read one thing on the air yeah and one thing is that everyone gets to turn

2325
02:48:33,300 --> 02:48:40,260
in the barrel so for that point for a while it was xbox one's turn to be in the barrel that's

2326
02:48:40,260 --> 02:48:45,700
that's how that's how the news goes yeah I think I think that's very true um the same thing happens

2327
02:48:45,700 --> 02:48:51,220
in politics right you know sometimes it's the the red team or sometimes it's the blue team or

2328
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:57,140
sometimes it's it's all of them honestly so um you know it just just kind of depends on on what

2329
02:48:57,140 --> 02:49:03,300
the public eye is person is watching yes like for example when heroes of cosplay was on tv

2330
02:49:04,340 --> 02:49:09,220
all the blogs all the podcasts that's what everybody was talking about was heroes of cosplay

2331
02:49:09,220 --> 02:49:14,900
and then we're talking about it but we're like yeah we watch it only because I'm drinking when

2332
02:49:14,900 --> 02:49:19,780
I'm watching it and I'm giving my personal spin on it so it's a lot more entertaining as comparing to

2333
02:49:19,860 --> 02:49:24,100
what everybody else is saying about the show yeah I saw that there was some uh because you know

2334
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:27,700
everything's got to have an internet petition these days there's some internet petition going

2335
02:49:27,700 --> 02:49:33,620
around to uh make it fairly represent cosplay and I was kind of like well then it wouldn't

2336
02:49:33,620 --> 02:49:38,020
really be I mean it's tv right it's it's and it funny enough I don't know if you heard the

2337
02:49:38,020 --> 02:49:41,380
interview with Matt but we were joking at the end there about his time on the uh America's

2338
02:49:41,380 --> 02:49:46,740
worst driver and you know it was it was just tv it was tv show all right the fact that you brought

2339
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:51,380
up there as a petition I wanted to put my headset down and just start falling over laughter because

2340
02:49:52,420 --> 02:49:58,580
how well you try to put a personal a positive spin on cosplay as soon as it hits tv it's nothing

2341
02:49:58,580 --> 02:50:02,740
but drama drama drama drama drama and people are complaining about how it's gonna wreck the

2342
02:50:02,740 --> 02:50:06,500
community no you just brought everybody together I'm sure you know what if somebody did a reality

2343
02:50:06,500 --> 02:50:13,140
show about orange lounge radio there'd be oh my god the shit talking right like that because

2344
02:50:13,140 --> 02:50:17,620
that's what tv does and that's that's what would happen even though you know what we all we all get

2345
02:50:17,620 --> 02:50:22,260
along mostly when it when it comes to no for real we all get along great when it comes to you know

2346
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:26,740
time to do the show the run for president do we do we have our disagreements behind the scenes

2347
02:50:26,740 --> 02:50:30,900
sure once in a while but they're disagreements among friends don't if you don't shut up what

2348
02:50:30,900 --> 02:50:36,500
are you talking about you don't know shit I'm totally judging you it no in all seriousness like

2349
02:50:36,500 --> 02:50:43,060
any argument we have behind the scenes is like like I think if any friendship goes forever with

2350
02:50:43,060 --> 02:50:49,700
no disagreements it's like that's that's almost boring yeah that sounds right also on the same

2351
02:50:49,700 --> 02:50:54,500
token when you're arguing it kind of brings the friendship stronger because you got from points

2352
02:50:54,500 --> 02:50:59,380
of view that you bring it to the table yeah and then when you're tired of arguing you look at

2353
02:50:59,380 --> 02:51:04,980
Jamie like you want a drink let's have a drink that's right that's right I had seven last night

2354
02:51:05,780 --> 02:51:12,420
any problem can be solved with liberal amounts of booze uh so you know what I I like that as a um

2355
02:51:12,420 --> 02:51:18,500
great response to you know just just the the people that felt a little bit like um uh that

and uh you know you always say this is the show where every gamer has a voice and um I just want

2379
02:53:25,700 --> 02:53:32,340
to voice my opinion on this whole uh supposed console war do it um yeah me okay it can it can

2380
02:53:32,340 --> 02:53:37,780
be said that I'm more on the side of playstation 4 like I'll admit that like right away but it's

2381
02:53:37,780 --> 02:53:42,980
not so much where it's you know for me it's not really Sony versus Microsoft it's really their

2382
02:53:42,980 --> 02:53:47,780
policies that really pissed me off I feel that um you know I've been gaming for a long time I mean

2383
02:53:47,780 --> 02:53:53,700
since the early 80s I've been gaming and I just see a trend happening that I don't like in gaming

2384
02:53:53,700 --> 02:53:58,180
which you know I'm actually prevents me from playing a lot of games these days just for the

2385
02:53:58,180 --> 02:54:02,500
simple fact that a lot of stuff is becoming I call it pay as you play with all this micro

2386
02:54:02,500 --> 02:54:08,260
transaction shit uh Microsoft is pushing that um all this crap about you know where uh you know

2387
02:54:08,260 --> 02:54:13,620
where you can lend your games and who you can lend it to the crappy uh the the freaking codes

2388
02:54:13,620 --> 02:54:18,260
that they give you so that uh you know you can't sell your game at a game stop not that I do that

2389
02:54:18,260 --> 02:54:24,260
like usually I like to just buy games brand new anyway online pass but um yeah yeah I just hate

2390
02:54:24,260 --> 02:54:30,420
the fact that like it seems like you know um you know if you're the type of person where you trade

2391
02:54:30,420 --> 02:54:33,860
your games or you might not have internet access or whatever it just seems like they're like

2392
02:54:33,860 --> 02:54:37,860
cutting those people out like I'm like there's still people out there that don't have all these

2393
02:54:37,860 --> 02:54:42,180
luxuries you know and like for you you know for you to just cut those people out like it really

2394
02:54:42,180 --> 02:54:46,500
just rubs me the wrong way so like I've been like anti-microsoft for the longest time now I mean

2395
02:54:46,580 --> 02:54:50,500
having even checked into xbox live and I don't know how many days I think well since this past

2396
02:54:50,500 --> 02:54:55,220
summer you know so like you know I'm doing like my own type of little uh boycott that you could

2397
02:54:55,220 --> 02:55:00,260
call it again certain not you know not just Microsoft but I mean a lot of the different

2398
02:55:00,260 --> 02:55:04,820
game developers and companies that they do things that I don't necessarily agree with like I mean

2399
02:55:04,820 --> 02:55:08,660
the list is huge I mean there's so many things that's going on right now let me let me ask let

2400
02:55:08,660 --> 02:55:12,980
me ask this question because you know because the the online pass thing thankfully we're seeing that

2401
02:55:13,060 --> 02:55:18,260
go away in a major way most of the companies that enacted it which to be fair Sony was one of them

2402
02:55:18,260 --> 02:55:23,620
with their first party games most of them that enacted the the online pass have since sunsetted

2403
02:55:23,620 --> 02:55:28,180
it I think there's only a couple stragglers out there and to Microsoft's credit they they never

2404
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:33,860
enacted the online pass on their first party games now we would have all raked them over the coals

2405
02:55:33,860 --> 02:55:38,180
if they had because they were already charging a fee for xbox live so that you know that's neither

2406
02:55:38,180 --> 02:55:43,780
here nor there but I guess my point I'm trying to make with this is when a when a company comes

2407
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:48,500
out and says you know what we were wrong we made the wrong decision which I think Microsoft kind

2408
02:55:48,500 --> 02:55:56,500
of did since e3 is that is that not is that not what you want or what what is it what can the

2409
02:55:56,500 --> 02:56:04,500
gaming companies do to win your fandom back uh just I mean you know just pretty much I would say

2410
02:56:05,380 --> 02:56:12,260
as far as as far as when it comes to lending your lending your games out trading your games

2411
02:56:12,260 --> 02:56:16,740
you know like I said people like to go into game stop and sell them whatever as far as that type of

2412
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:22,100
stuff goes don't you know don't try to put all these policies to get extra money out of people

2413
02:56:22,100 --> 02:56:27,140
that do that like let let people do do what they've been doing for years don't interfere

2414
02:56:27,140 --> 02:56:32,900
with that sell your game for 59.99 as once the person buys it you know that that that should be

2415
02:56:33,620 --> 02:56:38,900
your income right there you shouldn't charge people again to trade something in or whatever

2416
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:43,860
the other crap that you're doing out there let let me buy my shit and own my shit when I pay 60

2417
02:56:43,860 --> 02:56:48,900
bucks for your game I own that game right and especially with um like I said with these micro

2418
02:56:48,900 --> 02:56:54,420
transactions I mean everybody everybody everybody's pretty much getting their hands dirty into

2419
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:58,660
something like um even steam I would even go out to steam and say that a few things that they're

2420
02:56:58,660 --> 02:57:02,900
doing I don't necessarily agree with this um I don't know if you guys are aware of this but

2421
02:57:02,900 --> 02:57:07,860
they have this new thing now where it's um the early access have you guys seen this yes I have

2422
02:57:07,860 --> 02:57:13,460
in fact I I actually have a game with early access yeah yeah I bought into that too I actually have

2423
02:57:13,460 --> 02:57:16,980
two games that are early access that you know they pretty much I mean from what I can see they

2424
02:57:16,980 --> 02:57:22,180
look like they're like completed games but when you look at it you're like what the hell is going

2425
02:57:22,180 --> 02:57:27,940
on now like we're actually paying now for it incomplete games like like these are like alpha

2426
02:57:27,940 --> 02:57:31,940
games these are not even they're not even in beta you know a little minecraft you know what's

2427
02:57:31,940 --> 02:57:35,380
interesting though about that kaijuto is I think kickstarter showed that there was a market for

2428
02:57:35,380 --> 02:57:42,260
that yeah true so it's it's it it is weird it's weird to think that we are in that place with

2429
02:57:42,260 --> 02:57:47,380
gaming but I think a lot of it and I've expressed this before and I think it's important to note

2430
02:57:47,380 --> 02:57:52,260
let's not forget Microsoft realized they made a mistake there and they're they're trying to

2431
02:57:52,260 --> 02:57:56,340
correct it for better or for worse I think that's important to note but as far as like the steam

2432
02:57:56,340 --> 02:58:00,660
stuff goes and I remember saying this back when we all thought that this was the way Microsoft

2433
02:58:00,660 --> 02:58:05,460
was going to go before they reversed I sort of said you know what I think it really depends how

2434
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:09,860
much they're going to charge for a game and I still kind of stand by that because I would have

2435
02:58:09,860 --> 02:58:14,660
been totally fine with Microsoft's new policies if they were only charging 20 30 bucks for the game

2436
02:58:14,660 --> 02:58:19,060
was that what was going to bring the price down from the 60 limit which let's be real is still a

2437
02:58:19,060 --> 02:58:26,260
little high one of the perks of steam and one of the reasons why people use steam steam sale and

2438
02:58:26,260 --> 02:58:33,380
being able to buy games for literally a dollar I bought dlc quest for a dollar and so it's kind of

2439
02:58:33,380 --> 02:58:38,020
one of those all right so it's a digital copy and I'll never be able to sell it back it cost me a

2440
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:45,300
dollar and I'm like totally okay with that yeah I just finished um getting all the dlc that I needed

2441
02:58:45,380 --> 02:58:50,660
for Skyrim and also picking up Morrowind on steam so you know I like I like steam for that but I

2442
02:58:50,660 --> 02:58:56,980
mean um like I said it just it just looks like it to me I just don't like the uh the direction

2443
02:58:56,980 --> 02:59:02,500
that things seem to be going in the the reason why I'm so anti-microsoft is just for the simple fact

2444
02:59:02,500 --> 02:59:08,740
that inside me even though I'm pretty sure that um you know I'm the little man here it may never

2445
02:59:08,740 --> 02:59:13,940
be effective but for me it's like I feel okay Microsoft is kind of leading this charge if I

2446
02:59:13,940 --> 02:59:22,580
could find some way to uh to you know not not really to uh not really to uh um not really to

2447
02:59:22,580 --> 02:59:27,700
make uh to make people go my way or see things my way but if I could find some way to just uh

2448
02:59:28,660 --> 02:59:33,060
pretty much let them know that you know we don't agree with this or whatever you know maybe they'll

2449
02:59:33,060 --> 02:59:38,100
start to uh change the policies like they did with the uh you know with the uh xbox one how they

2450
02:59:38,100 --> 02:59:43,140
reverted everything back yeah I'm just hoping that and more people hop on that and more people get on

2451
02:59:43,140 --> 02:59:47,380
Microsoft and all the other people that are doing this type of you know these types of things then

2452
02:59:47,380 --> 02:59:52,180
maybe we'll be able to uh get some balance you know I just want some balance in the um in the

2453
02:59:52,180 --> 02:59:56,820
gaming world doesn't seem like it's that it just seems like pretty soon they're just gonna you know

2454
02:59:56,820 --> 03:00:01,700
they're just gonna walk all over the little man and there isn't much that can be done unless unless

2455
03:00:01,700 --> 03:00:06,100
us as gamers you know we start with all this console war crap and we see things for what they

2456
03:00:06,100 --> 03:00:10,100
are you know we tell them hey you know we don't like we don't like microtransactions or you know

2457
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:14,580
maybe you can fix it you know stuff like that let me let me get this out let me get this out

2458
03:00:14,580 --> 03:00:17,620
before we let you go because I think this is important to say because you know there's going

2459
03:00:17,620 --> 03:00:21,460
to be people sitting at home or in the office listening to this podcast right now that is

2460
03:00:21,460 --> 03:00:27,380
thinking this guy is crazy this guy needs to let it go this guy has too much hatred for easily you

2461
03:00:27,380 --> 03:00:31,300
know there's people sitting there thinking that right oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I come across

2462
03:00:31,300 --> 03:00:35,380
it all the time sure yeah but I think there's a good comment in the chat room that kind of plays

2463
03:00:35,380 --> 03:00:38,660
into both sides of this here and I think I think this is important this is from Chris109 in the

2464
03:00:38,660 --> 03:00:43,620
chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying yeah but the damage has been done and it takes time for

2465
03:00:43,620 --> 03:00:48,900
the wound to heal and I think in a way whether you personally listening to the show think

2466
03:00:48,900 --> 03:00:53,380
Kaijuto is overreacting or not I can certainly think you know I've gone to a place and I've

2467
03:00:53,380 --> 03:00:58,020
got bad service or a company did something to really irritate me and it was a while before I

2468
03:00:58,020 --> 03:01:05,060
tried that company again you know what I mean but I did go back at some point and either I learned

2469
03:01:05,060 --> 03:01:09,060
why I stopped doing it in the first place or I was like all right things are better things have

2470
03:01:09,060 --> 03:01:13,700
changed you know I'm happier now do you think Kaijuto that maybe that's what's going to happen

2471
03:01:13,700 --> 03:01:19,060
is that if Microsoft is a little more transparent in some of these policies and kind of gets that

2472
03:01:19,060 --> 03:01:23,940
community that they've lost that that tapped into the community if they can get some of that back

2473
03:01:23,940 --> 03:01:31,460
that maybe we can heal these wounds well you know me me personally I'm not you know don't don't get

2474
03:01:31,460 --> 03:01:36,900
me wrong like me I've already made my decision I mean my my boycott is gonna stick I mean that

2475
03:01:36,900 --> 03:01:42,260
you know I have to do what I have to do for myself basically like for me you know I don't want to

2476
03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:46,180
live in that type of gaming world so the games that I choose to purchase the companies that

2477
03:01:46,180 --> 03:01:51,060
choose to invest in they don't do any of that right now you know so that's what I'm doing

2478
03:01:51,060 --> 03:01:56,980
for myself you know like like I said I'm not out here to try and make people see things my way but

2479
03:01:56,980 --> 03:02:02,660
I just want people to be aware that you know the gaming world as it is now is uh it's pretty

2480
03:02:02,660 --> 03:02:07,300
screwed up and uh I'm just saying that people need to be aware of that stop with the console

2481
03:02:07,300 --> 03:02:12,500
world stuff it's not about xbox versus uh playstation 3 for some of us out there for

2482
03:02:12,500 --> 03:02:17,540
some of us it's more about hey you know don't you know don't cut the little man out you know

2483
03:02:17,540 --> 03:02:21,780
you know you know remember where gaming or you know remember what gaming was about originally

2484
03:02:21,780 --> 03:02:25,300
you know it was originally about fun I mean of course you have companies who you know they got

2485
03:02:25,300 --> 03:02:29,620
to make money you know everybody says it all the time but I mean it was always fun you know

2486
03:02:29,620 --> 03:02:32,500
trading with your you know trading with your friends and all this stuff and now it's just

2487
03:02:32,500 --> 03:02:38,340
becoming way way too political and way too like out of hand all this crap so that's what I'm

2488
03:02:38,340 --> 03:02:41,540
saying all right well I think you make a good point at the end of the day is it's just you

2489
03:02:41,540 --> 03:02:45,700
know what play play play the games because there's a lot of good stuff out there right now so right

2490
03:02:45,700 --> 03:02:49,300
cuz you know thank you for the call and for the perspective that could be challenging for some

2491
03:02:49,300 --> 03:02:54,580
I appreciate it all right all right take care buddy all right one eight seven seven game olr

2548
03:08:10,180 --> 03:08:19,220
call uh you know this week you know don't make serious calls all right well um now all you have

2549
03:08:19,220 --> 03:08:25,780
you know I always have heard uh the topic is I was dealing with my cat at the time but uh

2550
03:08:26,740 --> 03:08:32,420
I believe you know but you I believe like the three of you or well whoever you were talking

2551
03:08:32,420 --> 03:08:40,980
about uh no someone linking again linking mental illness in video games to violence and uh

2552
03:08:42,660 --> 03:08:50,420
yes you know you know and now I'm gonna open up here a little bit and talk about something

2553
03:08:50,420 --> 03:08:59,460
that I generally don't talk about okay I'm mentally ill myself uh and you know I was

2554
03:08:59,460 --> 03:09:08,580
back in 1998 I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder

2555
03:09:09,940 --> 03:09:20,180
which is also known as PTSD also known as shell shock okay uh and as a result of between those

2556
03:09:20,180 --> 03:09:31,620
two diagnoses I generally have a hard time regulating emotions and sometimes my behavior

2557
03:09:32,500 --> 03:09:39,540
as a result can be a little bit off you know it can be construed as odd or unusual uh

2558
03:09:40,420 --> 03:09:48,660
to someone they may not have to deal with mental illness now that being said just because someone's

2559
03:09:48,660 --> 03:09:55,700
mentally ill you know regardless of whether they play video games or not that does not mean

2560
03:09:55,700 --> 03:10:04,420
they're gonna go Norman Bates on someone's ass no nor go Texas Chainsaw Massacre on someone

2561
03:10:04,420 --> 03:10:10,340
no one said they did well I think I don't think we did but I think the media sometimes gives that

2562
03:10:10,740 --> 03:10:19,300
well you know I'm just saying that's what the general you know that's what the general uh

2563
03:10:20,020 --> 03:10:25,700
perception is in society is that if someone someone has mental illness that's that's what

2564
03:10:25,700 --> 03:10:29,460
we talk about when we talk about the stigma of mental health that's that's what's out there and

2565
03:10:29,460 --> 03:10:33,380
thank you for opening up about that Raginator that's that's brave of you to say on the show

2566
03:10:33,380 --> 03:10:39,060
and I'm going to say this the reality is there's there's a lot of people like you out there and

2567
03:10:39,060 --> 03:10:45,060
it's funny even though I'm talking about earlier in the show I feel like the only gay nerd I bet

2568
03:10:45,060 --> 03:10:49,860
you're not the only nerd pardon pardon me but you you must be a bit of a nerd if you listen to the

2569
03:10:49,860 --> 03:10:53,380
show you're probably you're probably by far not the only nerd that suffers from the types of

2570
03:10:53,380 --> 03:10:58,420
conditions that you're that you're talking about that you that you just brought up and um you know

2571
03:10:58,420 --> 03:11:03,140
I think I think mental illness is much more common than sometimes the media and the mass perception

2572
03:11:03,780 --> 03:11:11,060
often gives it credit for but there's also so many variant uh varieties and for example some people

2573
03:11:11,060 --> 03:11:17,300
who have certain disorders don't consider it to be a mental illness for example yeah I may be

2574
03:11:17,300 --> 03:11:24,020
autistic I don't consider myself mentally ill you know yeah if I had well and it in a way and just

2575
03:11:24,020 --> 03:11:28,180
just to kind of you know because because like people get sick not mental illness but physical

2576
03:11:28,180 --> 03:11:35,380
illness is a person with diabetes necessarily considered themselves sick not I mean they're

2577
03:11:35,380 --> 03:11:40,660
managing you know I mean that's kind of what what happened right am I there's a difference because

2578
03:11:40,660 --> 03:11:46,580
well I mean that the better comparison and I'm not and just I am not belittling diabetes by any

2579
03:11:46,580 --> 03:11:51,300
mean my grandma had it and suffered from it and so forth but I'm just saying you start to kind of

2580
03:11:51,300 --> 03:11:57,540
you know treat it and it doesn't like it doesn't you you conduct your day-to-day life managing it

2581
03:11:57,540 --> 03:12:03,860
the difference would be in autism and type 1 diabetes would be closer to each other

2582
03:12:03,860 --> 03:12:09,940
PTSD and type 2 diabetes would be closer to each other as a comparison because something happened

2583
03:12:09,940 --> 03:12:17,700
that caused this it's an onset right whereas me I was born this way right so um that being said

2584
03:12:17,700 --> 03:12:21,780
I think what they're not also considering is that some of these people who have gone back

2585
03:12:22,420 --> 03:12:32,980
um were had much more severe forms of socio uh disorders had there wasn't one of them

2586
03:12:32,980 --> 03:12:38,260
actually diagnosed schizophrenic which means they hallucinate schizophrenic is not multiple

2587
03:12:38,260 --> 03:12:44,020
personality disorder there are two different things some people have complete reactions

2588
03:12:44,020 --> 03:12:52,260
based on trauma I know people with PTSD and I'm talking about like the uh the post-war variety

2589
03:12:52,260 --> 03:13:00,580
you know who you a car backfires and they're running for cover right you know that's the

2590
03:13:00,580 --> 03:13:05,620
type of person I would not want with a gun for example that's somebody who I wouldn't want to

2591
03:13:05,620 --> 03:13:11,780
have access to weapons because I've seen that instant look for panic look for defense you know

2592
03:13:11,780 --> 03:13:17,700
sometimes there is that but when you're you know but the average person dealing with depression or

2593
03:13:17,700 --> 03:13:22,340
dealing with just that you also I just want to be careful with the broad generalizations because

2594
03:13:22,340 --> 03:13:28,420
you also would not be the one to say who and who shouldn't exactly a professional does this not you

2595
03:13:28,420 --> 03:13:32,020
exactly but but my point what real quick raising you're sorry I'll let her finish the region here

2596
03:13:32,020 --> 03:13:36,900
we'll get back to you my point on that was saying that is that if a person is going to have a

2597
03:13:36,900 --> 03:13:45,060
tendency to go into a defensive mode or to go into some sort of a memory regression

2598
03:13:46,020 --> 03:13:51,380
you want to watch you know but you don't know who everybody is that's why there has to be better

2599
03:13:51,380 --> 03:13:56,100
screening that was my point sorry no no worries rage nator go ahead and get your thought out and

2600
03:13:56,100 --> 03:14:02,580
then I have a question for you now also one thing to consider is you know you know regardless of

2601
03:14:03,380 --> 03:14:12,020
what you know diagnosis that someone has be a ptsd or schizophrenia or this or other you know

2602
03:14:12,020 --> 03:14:19,380
some questions that should be asked is are they in some form of treatment are they seeking one-on-one

2603
03:14:19,380 --> 03:14:23,940
counseling are they seeing psychiatrists getting medications are they taking their

2604
03:14:24,580 --> 03:14:31,220
medications as prescribed you know and it's usually taking up this pill or this pill

2605
03:14:31,860 --> 03:14:37,940
at the right you know levels you know dosages every day consistently at the right time

2606
03:14:38,820 --> 03:14:47,380
so and so forth and I mean you know if they're not you know they're not seeking you know treatments

2607
03:14:47,380 --> 03:14:54,420
uh not taking their medications as prescribed if they're abusing street drugs or alcohol

2608
03:14:55,300 --> 03:15:01,540
then yeah their their behavior is going to get far far worse and plus if

2609
03:15:02,500 --> 03:15:08,980
they and if you also you know one thing to consider is on top of that

2610
03:15:09,780 --> 03:15:17,060
ninth or more often than not the mentally ill is the the victim of crimes you know

2611
03:15:17,060 --> 03:15:26,020
relative to perpetrator if you know you know if let's say uh hydrasically speaking I don't know

2612
03:15:27,300 --> 03:15:33,140
you know you're Sacramento at all so I don't know what areas of town are the good

2613
03:15:33,140 --> 03:15:38,180
side sites of town where aren't where the homeless tend to be so and so forth but

2614
03:15:39,060 --> 03:15:46,580
if you can think of what area area that the homeless and the mentally ill tend to congregate

2615
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:52,100
and you happen to be on the street up to no good chances are you're gonna probably

2616
03:15:53,780 --> 03:15:57,940
if you want an easy mark you're gonna probably go after the people that

2617
03:15:58,580 --> 03:16:05,620
won't put out much of a fight which probably will be the mentally ill you know so you know

2618
03:16:05,620 --> 03:16:12,340
what's new great well yeah you'll hear about the guy with schizophrenia that first some woman off

2619
03:16:12,340 --> 03:16:18,420
of a training platform that woman gets killed but there are the exceptions to the rule not

2620
03:16:18,420 --> 03:16:26,420
the world itself you know right and chances are there that person that can't take their medication

2621
03:16:26,420 --> 03:16:35,700
or you know was doing wasn't alcohol alcohol drugs a few hours earlier or multiple whatever so

2622
03:16:35,700 --> 03:16:40,020
rage nator let me let me ask you this and and and then we we will unfortunately I mean we can

2623
03:16:40,020 --> 03:16:42,740
make a whole show out of this topic but we do have to wrap up for the night but rage nator let

2624
03:16:42,740 --> 03:16:46,900
me ask you this because because you did share with us some pretty private information about

2625
03:16:46,900 --> 03:16:51,940
your life and so forth and there is that stigma out there that you know video games are bad and

2626
03:16:51,940 --> 03:16:57,860
video games make you uh want to do bad things how do you think rage nator maybe you don't have an

2627
03:16:57,860 --> 03:17:02,820
answer for this but I want to try and ask it anyway uh rage nator how do you think video games

2628
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:13,220
help you uh well in the times that I stressed out you know or depressed you know let's say I'm

2629
03:17:13,220 --> 03:17:22,180
feeling uh severe depression you know depression symptoms or there's some kind of stimulus outside

2630
03:17:22,180 --> 03:17:32,020
that's really educating me one way or another uh and I use my video games as my primary

2631
03:17:33,380 --> 03:17:44,020
coping uh coping mechanism to deal with uh the symptoms uh like uh at least prior to my ps3

2632
03:17:44,020 --> 03:17:53,060
being uh stolen I would either play flower or super stardust hd and now obviously flower is

2633
03:17:53,060 --> 03:18:03,460
a very relaxing game yeah very much or but regardless of the game now I'll focus in on that

2634
03:18:03,460 --> 03:18:10,500
game for a while and for all intents and purposes while playing the game the rest of the world

2635
03:18:10,500 --> 03:18:18,500
and my own thoughts no don't exist I just focusing on completing the level with being the level being

2636
03:18:18,500 --> 03:18:29,780
the ai doing whatever and after a while uh things go back to normal and I use air quotes uh well

2637
03:18:29,780 --> 03:18:39,860
normal for me right now sure sure and you know what's a great well that doesn't work 100 percent

2638
03:18:39,860 --> 03:18:46,340
of time once a great well is so bad that I do need to be hospitalized case in point uh

2639
03:18:47,300 --> 03:18:54,740
February 12th uh second of last year I did have to go to hospital for the suicide attempt but

2640
03:18:54,740 --> 03:19:04,580
sorry to hear that but generally speaking the video games do work no no they help me focus in

2641
03:19:04,580 --> 03:19:14,820
something else besides the the symptoms so well thank you for um sharing some very deeply personal

2642
03:19:14,900 --> 03:19:19,140
stuff with us um but you know again to tie it back to something I was talking about at the

2643
03:19:19,140 --> 03:19:23,540
beginning of the show sometimes it's about getting outside that bubble and there might be people out

2644
03:19:23,540 --> 03:19:28,420
there that like don't kind of realize it and so maybe now they're thinking about it because you

2645
03:19:28,420 --> 03:19:33,140
you said something about it here on the show so I really appreciate you opening up and uh how dare

2646
03:19:33,140 --> 03:19:36,740
I suggest that you aren't capable of making a serious call because it was a very serious call

2647
03:19:36,740 --> 03:19:41,460
thank you for that perspective don't I feel like a jackass definitely thank you though but I mean

2648
03:19:41,460 --> 03:19:46,580
and this is one thing that I think everybody has a responsibility to do and that's educate yourself

2649
03:19:47,460 --> 03:19:51,300
and people don't often think about educating themselves on something that's outside their

2650
03:19:51,300 --> 03:19:56,580
comfort level their comfort zone walk walk a mile in somebody else's shoes because at least at the

2651
03:19:56,580 --> 03:20:01,620
end of the day if nothing else you you have their shoes you have their shoes and you're a mile away

2652
03:20:01,620 --> 03:20:06,980
all right yeah but but that was you know thank thank you for giving some incentive for education

2653
03:20:06,980 --> 03:20:12,500
as well appreciate it sure all right rage nader I gotta I gotta end it up and end up the show

2654
03:20:12,500 --> 03:20:16,180
thank you but thank you buddy have a good one sure no problem have a nice night all right you

2655
03:20:16,180 --> 03:20:22,660
too uh props to rage nader says act deaf in our chat room there we go all right uh whoo

2656
03:20:23,860 --> 03:20:28,660
and to think I almost didn't take that call because we were on our way out of here but now

2657
03:20:28,660 --> 03:20:32,820
we are definitely on our fingers we're hovering over the altar just by time I know I was like

2658
03:20:32,820 --> 03:20:36,340
am I gonna take it am I gonna take all right we're gonna take it so and it was a really really um

2659
03:20:36,340 --> 03:20:40,980
insightful call heavy stuff on tonight's show my god we covered a lot of good stuff tonight

2660
03:20:40,980 --> 03:20:45,140
it was a this is a damn good show this was what this was one for the emmys I have I don't know

2661
03:20:45,140 --> 03:20:50,500
if they give emmys to podcast but if they did I'd be submitting this one I have one last fun silly

2662
03:20:50,500 --> 03:20:54,340
thing okay good good please has anybody ever actually made it to the bottom of the steam

2663
03:20:54,340 --> 03:20:58,500
cell page yeah and you've seen the fact that it's upside down yeah you notice the fact that it says

2664
03:20:58,500 --> 03:21:03,620
spring yeah yeah no instead of autumn and if you actually use that navigation your experience will

2665
03:21:03,620 --> 03:21:08,100
be temporarily upside down as well on on some pages not all you go all the way to the bottom

2666
03:21:08,100 --> 03:21:13,460
you hit featured items you get the featured item pages where autumn is on bottom and everything is

2667
03:21:13,460 --> 03:21:17,860
upside down you scroll to the top spring sale is oriented right side up incredibly silly but

2668
03:21:17,860 --> 03:21:22,980
hilarious and I figure most people just scroll down until they see a game as soon as the game

2669
03:21:22,980 --> 03:21:27,300
stopped being listed by yeah I'll have multi-button didn't get steam card didn't care

2670
03:21:28,260 --> 03:21:33,620
exactly all right uh well and then for Australia since they're all upside down and it's spring

2671
03:21:33,620 --> 03:21:40,340
there that's that's a joke it's a joke our our chat system at work we have a plug-in for it so

2672
03:21:40,340 --> 03:21:47,460
anybody that's low even visiting anybody that's uh located as in the southern hemisphere that we

2673
03:21:47,460 --> 03:21:52,500
rotate their avatars upside down that's amazing I love it it's called the Aussies plug-in all right

2674
03:21:52,580 --> 03:21:56,260
uh Jason since you do have the mic I want to thank you for being here on the show yet again

2676
03:21:59,860 --> 03:22:05,860
uh it's great to have you here and um I I guess I'll ask you if you have any final thoughts

2677
03:22:05,860 --> 03:22:11,940
before we see you next week I'll be continuing to say this because we're not even here yet but

2678
03:22:11,940 --> 03:22:16,180

03:22:35,140 --> 03:22:41,780
and aqua and stuff at mcdonald's really it's part of a promotion you know with xbox one stuff

2684
03:22:47,140 --> 03:22:54,020
ps4 uh I did like and oh and never mind uh I have a couple final thoughts here real quick and uh

2685
03:22:54,020 --> 03:22:58,180
one uh it looks like it looks like some of you chatters are having a spirited debate right now

2686
03:22:58,180 --> 03:23:01,460
so don't don't forget like rama and I were talking about earlier go have a drink at the end of the

2687
03:23:01,460 --> 03:23:09,380
