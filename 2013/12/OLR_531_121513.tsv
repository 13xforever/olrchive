10216	11898	Guy, and Loki!
31445	33126	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
59420	61421	Hi How are you, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?
62081	63682	I'm okay You're okay?
63882	84573	Been better I think you and I are kind of in the same boat right now We are recovering from the plague Yes, we both have been a bit plague-ish this past weekend Although I don't think it's the same plague, or maybe it is, I don't know But I don't think I gave you cooties I don't think you gave me cooties I wasn't very, very sick But I've just been tired and worn down, so
85532	86453	I think I got it from Becky.
86473	87414	Or from Dan getting it at work.
101289	102750	I've been sitting here rolling my eyes for a solid month.
123564	129507	Because seriously, this isn't cold and it's not humid, so you don't get cold with wet wind.
130007	131928	Well, here's a funny piece of that puzzle.
132669	138652	Who's not here tonight in studio, although he's been joining us on and off for the past month, not here tonight is Jason, our announcer.
138732	142213	He has the night off, and would you like to guess why he has the night off?
142474	143114	He has the plague.
143174	143834	He has the plague!
145735	152642	But I'm fairly certain that the whole reason why I haven't been as sick as everybody else has been is because I practically live at the gym now.
166127	167928	Aren't you not supposed to work out when you're sick, though?
167968	170209	I thought that was like a big no-no.
170369	179474	I was reading lately that for people who spend regular, like at least two or three days at the gym a week, tend to have a stronger immune system.
180675	180975	Huh.
181514	187039	So if anything, that would explain why I've only been sick for like a day.
187399	192303	Yeah, but like Extrovert from Horde House is a big old gym guy now and he still gets sick a lot.
192684	196707	Well, not a lot, but like as sick as often as I do.
197168	202052	I don't know, but I haven't gotten sick nearly as often as I used to before this became a regular thing, so...
203527	203807	TechMasterLoki
219571	219711	Yeah.
219891	220052	Yeah.
220092	221313	What day did you have your wisdom teeth out?
221753	222073	Thursday.
222233	222614	Thursday.
222654	223114	So you're here.
223294	224755	This is only like three days later.
225016	226757	See, it's so different for different people.
226837	228819	Like some people are better like the next day.
229299	230220	Like go right back to work.
230280	231761	Some people are out for like two weeks.
231921	233042	Yeah.
233603	234443	Two weeks.
234744	235304	Oh, yeah.
236685	240807	Weren't you one of the ones that was out for like a frickin' two months or something insane?
240907	241868	Four months.
241988	243749	Oh my god, what happened?
244069	246170	The holes never filled in on the bottom teeth.
246410	249932	So I basically had swelling and bruising for at least two of those months.
250453	254635	And then the pain didn't... I was on antibiotics for... I was on five different antibiotics.
254655	255655	Was that pre-OLR though?
255715	257216	Because I don't remember that affecting the show.
257596	257717	Ugh.
258617	259918	The show's been on too long.
260718	261018	Alright, sorry.
261499	262299	Loki's... Around 2004.
263120	264261	Oh, then I guess we would have had the show.
264421	265162	Uh, Loki's moment.
265302	265562	Sorry.
265802	270166	No, I saw the swelling, um, and I can't really chew food.
270526	272447	I mean, I can sort of chew food.
272467	277852	Like, I've been slowly getting into more solid stuff, you know, because before it was smoothies and soup.
278952	280153	And that's it.
280694	285898	So, today, I tried to do french fries from McDonald's and it sort of works.
286158	286739	It sort of works.
286759	287399	You're making it work.
287739	288060	I guess.
288500	289180	Um, and then, um,
291260	300226	Yeah, so I'm not, like pain medication, I'm not really taking any unless, you know, sometimes during the night just because it makes the swelling, the feeling of the swelling go down.
300547	304389	Like right now, like today, I don't feel as swollen, but it feels like it's all swollen on the inside.
304430	309533	Like sometimes like if I sleep on my side or something, I feel like I bite my cheek or something.
309553	309933	Yeah.
309953	311535	So I kind of get that feeling right now.
311555	312175	Yeah.
312195	313896	I already had one of the stitches come out, so.
314136	314497	Ooh.
314517	317559	I was like, you know, sitting there talking, I was like, pfft.
319000	319580	What is this?
319760	321741	There's a string here.
322521	322661	Ew!
322981	324222	Let's not get too detailed.
324262	326863	We want people to keep listening before we get to the video game talk.
327404	330445	But I'm glad to see you're doing much better.
330485	333586	It looks like you're one of those people that made a quick recovery, so good for you.
333686	338949	Apparently I metabolize the anesthesia medicine really fast too.
339389	344754	Yeah, I was going to say, what happened to the Loki goes to the dentist or whatever video that was going to be planned?
345595	346676	I wasn't really out of it.
347157	360230	I mean, I was a little tired and stuff at first because they gave me Valium to take before I went there, which is good because I have all sorts of unnecessary phobias about all sorts of...
361471	364454	Surgical, probably because I haven't really done any of that stuff.
364854	369279	I've never had any experience with having surgery or being put under.
370460	375585	I don't really go to the doctor that often, so I get a little nervous around needles and stuff.
375625	377026	I just don't like it.
377306	381751	I know that there's no real danger to it, but it still makes me uneasy.
381911	383332	The Valium helped.
384293	386015	They wouldn't let me stay awake and listen to them.
386818	387839	Thanks for watching!
404995	406316	I don't know, work.
406616	408577	I'm so glad that shit knocks me the hell out.
408697	415060	And then I woke up and they're all trying to help me out, help me sit down.
415080	416160	I'm like, no, I'm not dizzy.
416200	417621	I can walk just fine.
418841	419662	That's not a problem.
419742	421262	And so we went out to the car.
421282	426545	I'm like, I'm not really, I'm tired, but I'm not really dizzy or anything.
426565	426885	Bummer.
427085	428286	Yeah, unfortunately I wasn't loopy.
428666	431588	Nellie said I said weird things, but all of those were intentional weird things.
431608	432669	I know, you always say weird things.
432729	436071	I was making bad jokes, and she's like, well, you said this joke.
436111	442575	I'm like, yeah, but I remember saying that, and I meant that on purpose, so that's not just me saying weird things.
443235	467790	Alright, let me go to the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com and if you are listening live on this Sunday night, come on down to the chat room live.vognetwork.com We often read comments from chat on the show because it is the show where every gamer has a voice YYR starting us off tonight saying, come for the video game talk stay for the gross medical drama Yes
468530	469351	It's like an episode of VR.
469511	470331	It wasn't that bad.
470411	473813	Now, if I start talking about my hernia surgery that I had a few years ago.
473833	474514	Can we not?
474634	475134	Let's not.
475394	475774	Can we not?
475794	476455	That was not fun.
476635	476975	All right.
477015	477215	Thank you.
477235	478156	That was way worse than this.
479357	480117	I was awake through that.
481258	483239	SSJ100 Matt saying, don't have rice.
484140	485961	I would say popcorn either way.
485981	487021	Well, yeah.
487081	488102	I'm not chewing anything.
488462	490223	It's pretty much all liquid stuff right now.
490483	491344	I ate a lot of pudding.
491992	495175	Stuff that I can... Eggs, you know, like I had eggs last night and those are dull.
495356	501982	They're like the best eggs ever because, you know, after having just smoothies and, you know, tomato bisque soup.
502002	502903	Do you like pudding?
503464	503584	No.
504184	506747	I was going to say because you can mix protein powder and pudding.
506767	511912	Yeah, my wife wanted me to have like... She got... Well, she meant to get rice pudding but it ended up being tapioca.
511932	512693	I'm like, no.
514374	520759	Awesome Unicorn is in our chatroom saying, man, when I had all four wisdom teeth out, I agreed to fill in for dinner theater the same night.
521219	530706	That's hardcore, because having to sing, I would assume dinner theater means you sing, and just all that vibration would, oh, that's not fun.
531987	537531	That must have been some non-impacted easy peasy teeth coming out there, because that's too much.
537878	542260	God, I was just thinking back to... I wanted to stay awake so I could watch.
542280	544400	I wanted them to put a mirror so I could watch.
544420	545161	No, thanks.
545221	546041	But they wouldn't let me.
546241	549322	Well, they wouldn't let me watch my hand surgery either because it was too small.
550062	557685	But they had to give me laughing gas to make my veins dilate so that they could get the IV in.
558605	561066	And that hand stayed bruised for like a week and a half.
561667	562387	Yeah, I saw that.
563483	580426	some more comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Zebediah the Messiah saying long time listener on iTunes first live show well welcome, welcome to the show yeah we've been getting some new listeners lately just thanks to, well I know he said he's a long time listener but just thanks to Stitcher, he's doing very well
580686	581546	Yeah, I don't recognize that name either.
581566	583187	We have Awesome Unicorn as well, who I don't recognize.
583207	584228	Isn't that a little redundant?
584528	586489	I mean, aren't all unicorns awesome?
586549	588129	All unicorns are pretty awesome.
588389	595052	The girl at Starbucks, when I told her that I wanted a unicorn when she asked if I wanted anything else, she drew a unicorn farting rainbows on my cup.
596113	598054	On the little sticker that goes on my reusable cup.
598074	598754	That's awesome.
598794	599394	I kept it.
599634	600115	It was great.
600215	600755	That's amazing.
601555	605297	And then DarkTetsuya in chat says, I was wondering if there was going to be a show or not.
605657	608719	Hearing everyone's sick and then Loki having his wisdom teeth out.
609459	614242	Well, we had to be here because otherwise Zebediah the Messiah would not have had a live show to listen to.
614282	618764	And honestly, I didn't know how it... I mean, I didn't know how... Everyone was saying, oh, you're going to be out for a while.
618844	619785	And I didn't know.
620245	624147	And hopefully nothing... I mean, so far, I think everything's healing just fine.
625168	627449	Who knows, like a week from now, you know, oh, sorry, that just...
627609	629333	Infection, lol So they give you Keflex?
636547	650117	No, Amoxicillin, and then I have the, because I can't swallow pills, yet somehow, thank goodness that that volume was really small, because I couldn't drink water with it, because normally I just, I down a little water and salt and stuff.
650137	652118	Druggie lounge radio, everybody.
652198	654099	Hey, this is legal if you've been prescribed it.
654119	660884	But no, I have whatever, it's like Tylenol with codeine or whatever, whatever that is.
661957	662879	They gave me Vicodin.
663960	666364	And then when those stopped working, they gave me horse pill Vicodin.
666945	671072	Like the one that's pure, pure hydrocodone and no other crap.
671946	675389	I just... When I had my gallbladder out, I slept for like a week straight.
675549	676490	That's just what I did.
677570	678091	You know what I did?
678351	681313	The first time I left the house after gallbladder surgery, do you know what I went to do?
681774	686117	I had my gallbladder surgery like two days before Halloween because it was my ex's birthday.
686217	686658	Hilarious.
687138	691802	But the first time I left the house after that was to go vote against Prop 8.
692022	694444	That was the first time I left the house after my gallbladder surgery.
695364	696165	What a worthy cause.
696205	697326	It was a very worthy cause.
698467	699708	And you didn't vote absentee.
700453	701773	No, I never vote absentee.
702554	707375	I'm one of those people where I'm like, I think absentee, for me, I realize tons of people vote absentee and that's cool, at least you're voting.
707675	709636	For me, absentee takes the magic out of it.
709936	714318	Like, I like to go in the little booth, click the, I don't know, there's just something about that whole process.
714378	715138	I don't like people.
715158	716679	Which is fine.
716699	721280	So I vote, I take my absentee, well, the voting place is actually, I could walk there in five minutes.
721340	721540	Yeah.
722100	726842	So I fill out my absentee ballot at home with the internet in front of me and then I go take it and drop it off.
727748	728029	Oh, okay.
728269	728589	That works.
728609	733035	So I've gone to the place, but I voted in a very comfortable manner.
733195	733615	There you go.
733836	734076	All right.
735017	740584	Anyhow, before we get into argument weeks and the things we've been playing this week, some other topics here at the top of the show.
740684	745170	I don't have a whole lot in regards to kickoff topics, but we are entering the holiday period.
745930	749131	Although we here at OLR, as far as I know, we're going to be doing shows every Sunday.
749171	755753	We're not taking any time off for the holidays because everybody kind of lucks out this year with Christmas and New Year's being on, what, Wednesdays?
755933	757553	I think Christmas and New Year's are both on Wednesday this year.
758813	761914	Sunday happens to be the 29th, so whatever.
761954	762814	We'll be here those days.
763275	765075	None of us are traveling anywhere major.
766195	772277	We will be here through the holidays, but since we're starting to ramp up toward that season, I don't know about you guys, but
773257	777802	I'm going to have a lot of time off where I'm doing nothing for like a week and a half at least.
778463	782507	Are you guys going to be catching up on any games or do you have any gaming plans through the holidays?
782587	786091	Like a wish list of things you got to get through in the next month?
786503	792349	Well, I still have to beat Skullgirls with everybody, which I just started it last night and beat it with Parasol.
792709	793890	Well, not last night, but the other day.
794631	799856	And I do want to get at least up to a 35 and finish that stupid quest that I'm stuck on.
799916	800657	And that's in 14.
800697	801037	14, yeah.
801077	801778	Right, yeah, okay.
801838	809285	But I'm still trying to do the play a new game every week thing, so like this past one with Skullgirls, I'm going to start Deadpool next week.
810406	810567	So...
811248	811688	There you go.
812269	814313	So that's my goal is just to do something different.
814454	815275	One new game a week.
815556	815977	I like that.
815997	818181	And then they'll be going to Washington later.
819491	820412	Oh, good luck.
820752	821593	Yeah.
821993	822894	Snowpocalypse.
823214	825096	Get lots of pictures of the snow on the way up there.
825616	828459	I will say thank you very much, Loki, before the show.
828479	831681	I hope you don't mind me saying this on air, but Loki gave some Christmas presents out before the show.
832382	835484	I got a Steam gift card from Loki, and I believe DarkSakura got one as well.
835664	836065	I did.
836245	840068	So I'm armed and ready for the winter sale.
840208	841209	When does that start, Loki?
841449	842410	The winter sale for Steam?
842430	844011	I thought the winter sale was already done.
844331	845332	Or is it the fall sale?
845772	846953	I can't keep track of these sales.
846993	849715	Well, there's going to be a Christmas New Year's sale.
849755	850715	There always is, right?
850955	851376	What is it?
851476	852736	But they don't call it Christmas.
852816	854477	They call it holiday sale, right?
854918	858360	I think what we just saw was the winter sale, and now there will be the Christmas sale.
858380	859741	Somebody in chat set us straight.
859761	861162	The winter festival sale.
861222	862883	It was the fall sale that they had.
862903	863063	Remember?
863083	864003	Because it's fall-spring.
864624	864904	Oh, yeah.
864924	866985	It was fall-spring because the thing was upside down.
867025	867545	It said spring.
867565	867946	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
868366	870147	So I think the winter sale is coming right up.
871078	872079	Yay.
872799	873020	Go ahead.
873220	873960	No, just saying yay.
874260	874701	Oh, yay.
874761	875501	Yay, sales.
876082	877423	Loki, what about your projects?
877743	879625	You love to start projects that you never finish.
879745	880725	How's that tablet going?
882266	886330	Actually, because I was actually thinking about that the other day because I got some more stuff for that.
886570	887811	Originally, I was going to use...
888751	899601	It's similar to how they did the crossplane thing where they had individual circuit boards for each controller and it would have hooked up almost like a cartridge that you'd plug in.
900121	906006	So I bought a Sonic 2 and Sonic & Knuckles Genesis thing.
906026	907828	I was going to rip the whole thing apart and use the...
908388	911349	You know, connectors on there for that.
912349	914970	But it's too damn small for what I want to do.
915230	917291	And I'm going to need to add stuff to it later on.
917371	919011	So I'm like, okay, that's not the way to go.
919111	926753	So the way to go is actually buying this... It's like a USB thumbstick that you plug into your system.
927493	928814	I forget what they call it now.
928914	931215	But it basically allows you to...
933275	943902	Use almost any controller on any system, including keyboard and mouse, on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PC, and it just works.
944002	945663	You can do that.
946664	955149	That simplifies wiring everything a lot more than it was before, because now I don't have to worry about having to switch between multiple different systems.
955789	961873	I can just wire up one controller to it, and then just run it through that, and it would work on multiple systems.
962293	963795	instead of having to do all that stuff.
963815	967358	But no, I'm still consciously working on all that stuff.
967398	972023	I just have to get the parts and figure out the feasibility and stuff to get it working.
972183	983734	Mainly right now is I'm trying to figure out how to make the actual case for all of it because that's going to be difficult since I've never done vacuum forming before and I have to design the case and...
984955	994702	But before that, I was kind of distracted by, okay, how am I going to get this so that I can wire up different controllers, configurations and stuff to one system?
994782	1000006	Well, now I don't do that anymore, so that makes it a lot easier in the design process.
1001158	1003159	But I'm still going to make it, eventually.
1003540	1006442	So what's your plan while you... Because I know you probably have a little time off of work.
1006482	1007402	What's your plan during that?
1007422	1008463	I don't have any time off of work.
1008943	1009063	Oh.
1009644	1013806	Well, I mean, you know, like... The days, but... The days, oh, yeah.
1014547	1027555	I mean, I will have time off of work a few weeks after that, but... Well, that's for the baby, so... Well, actually, right now, I've been kind of in the, you know, what do I want to play and stuff, and...
1028616	1029397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1058444	1066973	Thank you, DeepSilverInvolition, for wasting 40 fucking hours of my time playing that game and basically making my save completely useless.
1067134	1072039	And it's apparently a widespread problem where not only is it not a save thing...
1072700	1077904	It's like people that bought the DLC, their game's just not fucking working anymore.
1077924	1079406	It's so frustrating.
1079486	1081708	It's just, thanks a lot.
1081808	1085130	I was like, you know what, I just want to play something stupid today.
1085211	1087072	I just want to play some Saints Row.
1087613	1090775	After losing 40 hours in a game, how would you have the motivation to play again?
1090795	1094078	I'm going to cheat like a motherfucker is how I would do it.
1094578	1095719	See, that's the thing, though.
1095759	1102763	I don't even want to grind through, even cheating like crazy to make it super easy so I can just get through all of it fast.
1103143	1104264	I don't even want to do that.
1104364	1111348	Why should I even put myself through the effort to play this game when it's so obviously broken that...
1112568	1114689	I just, I can't, I can't do it.
1115069	1123653	And it's just, it's not gonna be worth it for these DLC missions, which, let me be honest, they're probably about 30 minutes long each, if I'm lucky.
1123953	1126134	And so, I just don't know if I want to do it.
1126394	1131196	Yeah, I would like to go back and do it, but I wish my save would work just fine, because...
1132546	1147286	I don't know, it was fun and it's definitely not mods because I've uninstalled, I deleted the whole game off my computer, redownloaded everything, no mods are in there it still fucking doesn't work so it's just something with their game and it's disappointing
1149213	1176561	but yeah, I don't know I try to figure something else to play for me, I kind of want to do the Jamie thing and try to do some new games although with Final Fantasy XIV getting a patch this week I'm obviously going to dump a lot of my time into that but I'm trying not to spend my entire vacation because my work actually shuts down between Christmas and New Year's we have to take the time off so I have lots of time off to do very little because my family doesn't do an awful lot of holidays you can hang out with me
1176661	1178784	We can absolutely hang out and do stuff.
1178804	1180145	Let's go to Ikea every day.
1180766	1181107	Every day.
1181367	1188916	Well, things should hopefully slow down a couple days after Christmas, which is the period that I've got all this time and nothing to do.
1189357	1194343	I might finally crack and get the PlayStation 4 because the finances are looking pretty good now, so this might be the time.
1194463	1195043	I finally do that.
1195063	1199226	Well, you know, and I understand if you're still hesitant about picking up the PlayStation 4 because there aren't a lot of games out there.
1199246	1203889	There is one game that's on current gen systems that would take up a good portion of your time.
1204070	1204650	Let me guess.
1204670	1206411	Does it start with grand and end with a five?
1206791	1207792	Yes, it does.
1208212	1211995	Actually, I was looking to see if it was on sale at Target when I was on Amazon.
1212035	1212475	Thirty nine.
1212515	1213176	Is it?
1213296	1214377	I might jump on that.
1214537	1215757	I really might jump on that.
1215918	1216178	Yeah.
1216658	1218559	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1241874	1243175	Just saying, just saying.
1243855	1248378	I'm not knocking the system, but it's just like, you know, there's not a lot I would play on it.
1248438	1254602	Even like the PlayStation 4, like either of the systems, there's not a lot I would really... We have no reason to look at either right now.
1254683	1264589	I really don't need a PlayStation 4 right now, but, you know, knowing that after seeing the Final Fantasy XIV footage with the remote play, I'm like, oh, God, I want... At least you know a date now.
1264769	1265810	Yeah, exactly, exactly.
1266070	1279979	and by the way, we just picked up Star Fox 3DS last night because we had coupons and Dan's all over that one so we've got plenty to play right now and Dan has a villager in Normandy you can go run by his tent now that Normandy is open
1280642	1308020	the other big games I have to beat are Mario 3D World and Zelda Link Between Two Worlds because I do love both those games a lot probably my best of the year for sure but I keep getting distracted with all these other games I'm trying to play too so I definitely want to play those games and beat them probably inevitably during the winter sale Bioshock Infinite will be on sale and I can finally play and beat that and I'm hoping I can get I think it's still on sale now it's been like dirt cheap like 10 bucks I bought mine ages ago for dirt cheap
1308180	1320215	I'm hoping I can get The Last of Us and Beyond Two Souls from the rental company over the holidays as well that would be fantastic or Zelda Wind Waker is on my list too because I gotta catch up with that
1320700	1322861	We've actually got Ocarina for 3DS on our list.
1323202	1323682	Dan and I do.
1323902	1324102	Wow.
1325383	1325743	All right.
1326264	1328825	Go into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1328985	1332447	Awesome Unicorn says, Resogun make the PS4 purchase worth it for me.
1332848	1334509	Yeah, that's one of the games I'm really eyeing.
1334589	1335449	I definitely want to get that.
1336250	1339352	Fifth Dream said, PlayStation 4 is worth it for Doki Doki Universe right now.
1339592	1340713	I don't know a lot about that game.
1340733	1341193	I've heard of it.
1342914	1349756	YYR says, a friend who works at GameStop said today that PS4s were sold out in 10 minutes, but Xbox Ones were in stock all day and didn't sell.
1349816	1351157	He had no idea why.
1352237	1355619	Yeah, I'm hoping that if I do want to get a PlayStation 4, I can actually get one.
1355639	1357859	That would be really great.
1358560	1359000	Let's see.
1359480	1363562	Ragenator says, Sky, technically no one actually needs any games or system.
1363962	1366683	People need food, water, shelter, oxygen, etc.
1366763	1368684	The question is, do you want the system?
1369744	1370425	DarkSakura, starting us off.
1390106	1391488	I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now.
1391869	1392350	Yes, you are.
1392490	1393491	Why are you lying to the listeners?
1393511	1394032	Don't lie to the listeners.
1394052	1394733	Normandy's open.
1394773	1395574	Everybody come hang out.
1396916	1399320	I've been playing Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds.
1399340	1401023	Your hubby made a house in Normandy, right?
1401570	1401730	Fucker.
1401750	1402110	I love him.
1427138	1431449	I love that asshole I'm also playing Zelda I uh
1436331	1437111	What else did I play?
1437731	1450855	Oh yeah, I played Skullgirls, which I really like, and finally got to, for some reason it doesn't work very well with the Capcom fighting controller, but it works just fine with the regular Xbox 360 controller, so that's what I'm using.
1453236	1455536	I loaded the Shiva, and then I stopped playing it.
1455656	1460798	I've probably done five more playthroughs of the Stanley Parable, and I got the Portal ending.
1462443	1464165	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1482335	1482856	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1498829	1500991	I tried to play more Bus to Move Universe.
1501491	1502793	It really is not very good.
1503493	1510499	I want to like it so much because playing it on my phone is freaking awesome, but playing it on the 3DS is not awesome.
1510639	1511300	It's not awesome.
1512401	1519948	And then, oh yeah, I've been playing a lot of Bejeweled on my phone because that's my I really need to get sleepy game.
1520969	1523711	And I like the music in that game.
1523771	1524432	I can't help it.
1525212	1528694	It does kind of have like new agey Philip Glass type of soundtrack to it.
1528714	1529754	Oh, I love Philip Glass.
1529774	1534777	But I mean, but the one on the phone, it's like this epic type music.
1535337	1546943	It's kind of almost like whenever you see ancient Mesopotamia, that type of music, you know, like you're watching Ben-Hur or something.
1546963	1548144	Yeah.
1548795	1550236	Epic movie trailer of epicness.
1550436	1550717	Epic.
1551117	1552258	It's epic.
1552798	1558783	And then I played more of Fractal.
1560344	1560985	Do you have Fractal?
1561485	1561625	No.
1562266	1563246	Okay, I'm getting you Fractal.
1563487	1563747	Sweet.
1563767	1564548	And you're going to live with it.
1565288	1565568	Sweet.
1566049	1566949	Fractal is a great game.
1567110	1568190	Free games rule.
1571513	1572694	So I'm ruining one of your presents.
1573394	1574115	Do you have Fractal yet?
1574515	1575176	You need to play Fractal.
1575441	1582283	Fractal is like the best puzzle game in the universe.
1582703	1583683	It makes me super happy.
1584323	1586184	By the way, for anyone who just showed up, Normandy's open.
1586484	1589585	Okay, that's probably about it because I didn't play any Final Fantasy this week.
1589625	1592626	I played last week, which is how I got harassed for my name.
1596331	1599975	And everybody go on the VOG website and read my article.
1600675	1601777	Alright, there you go.
1602377	1603519	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1604059	1605200	I played Grand Theft Auto Online.
1607122	1612468	I ended up in a lobby with, I guess, a modder or hacker or whatever you want to call him.
1613149	1617932	Whatever the case may be, I ended up level 40 and I have $13 million now, so that ain't bad.
1619273	1627178	And then I messed around with the content creator a little bit and tried to make a race and it turned out okay.
1627658	1629379	I guess you can stack objects.
1629419	1641287	There's like a trick where you can stack objects and make them float in the air, which is kind of what I wanted it to do in the first place, but they made it so damn difficult to do that, so I just kind of didn't mess with that part too much.
1641707	1642348	Thanks for watching!
1662662	1664864	I like the way it integrates in your game and stuff.
1664884	1667966	You see the waypoints on there, but they're orange instead of blue.
1668826	1674850	And you can go on Social Club and basically bookmark any stuff that you like on there.
1675150	1679273	And it will show up in your game and you can play it and do all sorts of fun stuff.
1679293	1684957	So right now they have just the race and deathmatch creator, but I guess more stuff is coming out later on.
1685857	1687959	And then, what else did they play this week?
1688119	1688199	Oh!
1689938	1692481	Some other strange stuff, or a little unusual, I guess, for me.
1692761	1699830	So, we were bored, and I was trying to occupy Josh, so I tried to get him to play Wii Sports.
1701131	1705537	That didn't work, because he didn't want to play it, and he wanted to watch me play it, so I showed him bullying.
1705737	1707379	So I played a little Wii Sports this week.
1708380	1709001	And, um...
1710484	1712925	Also played a little bit of Rabbids Go Home.
1712965	1718367	He thought that game was a little bit funnier because the rabbits are being stupid and gathering trash.
1718467	1719447	He still didn't understand.
1719747	1721308	Those games are kind of made for kids, too.
1721448	1722248	Yeah, exactly.
1722328	1728151	He didn't understand why the rabbit was screaming at people and their clothes were falling off and they were collecting clothes.
1728191	1733893	And he was worrying that their shopping cart was going to tip over because it was stacked really tall with all sorts of weird things.
1735093	1735833	So that was kind of funny.
1735874	1737094	He's like, you've got to be careful.
1738074	1738955	Don't turn so fast.
1741616	1743238	and then what else did I play?
1743258	1761893	I think I played a little bit of Just Cause Multiplayer just getting in the last little bit of their beta that should be launching actually tomorrow so I'm looking for that I'll be coming out on Steam worthwhile investment if I say so myself and then what else did I play?
1763534	1766857	Uh... A little Call of Duty, I guess, at work.
1767577	1768978	There's nothing really else to play there.
1769779	1772721	And, um... That's pretty much it for right now.
1773062	1778306	But, uh... Hopefully... Hopefully we'll get into some Saints Row.
1778406	1780548	I don't know if I want to go back.
1780708	1782329	It... It...
1785350	1785750	It's sad.
1785770	1786471	You're just frustrated.
1786511	1787171	Rabble, rabble, rabble.
1787191	1789451	No, seriously, it's sad.
1789491	1798053	Games like Saints Row 2 and stuff, I really liked going back into those and playing them again and stuff, but it's just the last couple of games they put out.
1798953	1802173	Even Saints Row 3rd, I think I played through that at least two or three times.
1802874	1804154	I just don't want to do it again.
1804194	1807975	I don't want to go through all the hassle because it's like, I've already seen that joke.
1808935	1809535	It's funny.
1810555	1811556	But, I don't know.
1812117	1822988	Maybe, maybe if a certain other host that was on this network, you know, that would pick up a copy, then it might be worth it since I have to start from the beginning.
1823348	1826572	We could go through together and play through a co-op campaign.
1826792	1829134	Then I can also get those extra achievements I don't have yet.
1829355	1830676	Alright, Travis Donovan, hope you're listening.
1833829	1861890	Or Bobby Okay, my gaming week I actually played a lot of random shit this week I powered on my 360 I've never heard of a lot of random shit, Rob It's a new game, it's by Random Shit Co So I powered on my 360 this week Which is like the first time in like four months Like I turned it on and it had to do a Like I seriously think the last time I played my 360 was When the Mass Effect DLC came out Sure it wasn't Forza Horizon
1862690	1863071	Jack shit.
1892670	1893531	I don't remember.
1893591	1895972	Do your friends list expand on 360 now, too?
1896092	1897633	Because Xbox supports a thousand friends?
1898414	1902056	No, because all I see... I don't see what you're playing on Xbox One.
1902096	1903757	All I see is that you're on Xbox One.
1903797	1905878	I don't see what they're doing.
1905898	1909621	Which is kind of weird, because you could do that on PC.
1909641	1911822	I remember I used to see what people were playing on PC, but...
1912162	1915444	No, they integrated there, so no, I don't have more than 100 people.
1916144	1916384	Weird.
1917025	1921467	Well, I have 99 friends right now, so find my username if you want to be the 100th person.
1922388	1925069	You have 99 friends, but so-and-so ain't one?
1925089	1926310	Yeah, somebody dropped me this week.
1926330	1927951	I don't know who, because it won't tell me.
1928831	1950863	and BlackWolf confirms no it doesn't well that sucks I was hoping for that expansion but oh well I admittedly haven't played a lot of 360 I'm not being a hater it's just nothing new I've really bought on 360 lately but I went back and visited some of my classics because I have a shit ton of downloads especially from like Xbox Live Arcade when Xbox first came out I know there's all that free stuff still although yeah I've been checking some of that out
1951263	1951863	And they love you.
1970811	1973092	Blessings be upon you for the mucus coming from your nose
1997102	1997602	It was weird.
1997842	1999523	It was one of those, like, you're going to sneeze, you're going to sneeze.
1999543	1999943	Just kidding.
2001304	2002005	Well, no.
2002485	2003725	Radio host's worst enemy.
2003765	2004286	Sorry about that.
2004386	2004926	And it's live.
2004986	2005586	Nothing I can do about it.
2006447	2006707	Oh, no.
2006767	2009969	Imagine being in customer service and having that happen when you're trying to... Oh, I'm sure.
2010089	2011549	I was in customer service for seven years.
2011569	2011789	No, no, no.
2011809	2016672	When you're trying to explain one's mortgage interest to them while they're yelling at you.
2017312	2019273	You see where this spot is right here.
2019333	2019773	That's where...
2021074	2022696	Anyway, let's see.
2022736	2030985	So I was playing Spelunky on now PlayStation Network, which literally it is the exact same game as it is on PC, so there's not a lot I can report on.
2031465	2032346	I did play it on Vita.
2032486	2037792	It looks great, although it's so tiny and it's hard to read things, but it worked well enough, so I'm cool with that.
2038633	2042237	And then I played one other game, and this game...
2044170	2072149	I know I'm gonna get shit for my opinion because I didn't really get it and I have a lot of friends that are really really into this game but I'm gonna be completely honest I loved the presentation of this game I loved the way things looked and I was really cracking up but when it came down to the game itself I just really didn't have a lot of fun with the wonderful 101 on Wii U and I know I'm gonna get crap for that but it is what it is
2072689	2073651	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2089452	2114001	so like the gist of it is that you control like an entire group of people and you pick up more people as you're running along and those people can be in different patterns like they can be in a circle to turn your main guy into having a giant like punching glove type of thing or it can be a straight line for a sword and then at some point when your group gets big enough you can kind of have both going on at once and then you also draw lines to get from place to place but a
2114501	2116182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2144196	2172390	and I guess the game is supposed to be very challenging which you know I can respect it for that but it was a lot of um just kind of slash slash like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game with this interesting mechanic so mash and slash and hope you get it right yeah kinda that's what I felt when I was playing the game and so I feel kind of bad for razzing it because again it had a great setup and everything was in this really cool like package and the presentation was awesome and it looked great um
2173070	2176552	But yeah, the game itself, I just didn't really have fun with it.
2177232	2177772	So I don't know.
2177812	2182135	I feel like this is one of those games that if I revisit it in a month or two, maybe I'll enjoy it again.
2182195	2184256	But I didn't really care for it.
2185076	2186297	Well, you are entitled to your opinion.
2186357	2186717	I am.
2186837	2187157	I am.
2187217	2189038	And I know I'm going to get emails telling me I'm wrong.
2189278	2189619	Whatever.
2189639	2190679	I thought it looked like Pikmin.
2191179	2191820	I mean, I don't know.
2194961	2195602	Not really.
2198283	2199023	Beautiful Pikmin.
2199484	2199784	Yeah.
2201268	2201528	No.
2203229	2203909	No, it's not.
2204590	2204930	All right.
2206710	2208291	So that was really it for my gaming week.
2208411	2211773	So I might try to get into that game like one more time.
2212053	2214114	Keep in mind, that was the game I played when I was sick.
2214354	2219096	So that could have been like kind of, but I'll try it one more time after I feel better.
2219136	2223097	And if I still don't care for it, I'm probably going to send that one on back and get something else.
2224238	2225698	But anyway, that's really it for my gaming week.
2226219	2226979	So anybody else?
2229031	2231475	pizza pizza pizza you bringing me pizza?
2232376	2234019	no alright
2236238	2237518	Let's see, some quick housekeeping.
2237658	2242079	By the way, you better bring out your DS so that I can get the last piece of the puzzle I need for the Rhythm Heaven puzzle.
2242099	2243380	Your thing hasn't street passed with me yet?
2243600	2243740	No.
2243920	2244280	Should have.
2244360	2244760	Huh, weird.
2244820	2244980	No.
2245180	2255002	Okay, so don't forget to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and Google+, google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
2255602	2258463	And as far as shows off over the next few weeks, we don't have any planned.
2258523	2259623	We will be here Sundays.
2260083	2260804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2280157	2283680	You get an entry into the raffle, but you do have to opt into the raffle.
2283700	2284880	You're not just entered by default.
2285181	2290744	So you actually need to go to vognetwork.com, click on raffles, and actually enter the raffle.
2291445	2296408	This month we are giving away a $20 gift card to an online source of your choice.
2296868	2298309	Meaning, I think the options are...
2298889	2305454	Xbox, PlayStation, Steam, Wii U, and regular Wii because those are still separate.
2306314	2310457	And then I know iTunes is in there too for people who don't even have any gaming consoles whatsoever.
2310497	2311618	Google Play probably.
2311998	2314640	I don't think Google Play was one of the options, but it probably should be.
2315160	2318222	I'm pretty sure if you came in and said, I really don't want any of those.
2318282	2319103	I want Google Play.
2319383	2321204	I'm pretty sure we can make that happen for you.
2321284	2325927	So that is over at vognetwork.com slash raffle.
2326408	2326968	So check that out.
2329289	2353874	and if you you can either check in live and you get five points just for listening to the show or there's a if you're listening on the podcast feed there's a passphrase hidden somewhere in the show and you've probably heard it before Jason interrupts the show at some point and says to register participation for this week's episode and then he gives you a little passphrase you go to vognetwork.com you type that in the front page and you will get your points but make sure you opt into the raffle if you want to win your $20 card that's not Google Play
2355134	2356835	Just kidding.
2356995	2357776	Is Bobby in chat?
2357916	2359297	Bobby, can they have Google Play?
2359677	2362118	If they really want that more than anything, can they have Google Play?
2363539	2364600	I'll need to hear back from Bobby.
2365581	2367242	VOG Master Bobby in just a minute here.
2368883	2370303	Other thing I want to promote.
2371604	2376867	It's award season for things that you like, movies and so forth, and podcasts are no different.
2377728	2382031	Sadly, we didn't get nominated for the podcast awards, although I appreciate those of you guys that tried.
2382091	2383191	I know many of you were trying.
2383692	2384052	We weren't.
2384332	2385652	Oh, yeah, we didn't get nominated, sorry.
2385732	2387153	No, we did not get nominated for the Podcast Awards.
2387493	2389873	Lots of indie shows did, though, so I can't be mad.
2390274	2393494	And I have a pretty good feeling I know which one of them is going to win.
2393534	2395735	And if they do win it, they totally deserve it.
2396815	2399556	But I won't say it because I don't want to make a boobie of myself.
2400016	2403837	But, yeah, Podcast Awards, unfortunately, we're not there.
2403877	2408078	But we do have a chance to do the Stitcher Awards are going on right now.
2408138	2411819	And I love Stitcher because Apple's podcast app right now,
2413151	2413932	DarkSakura.com
2438307	2446514	I know some of the other VOG Network shows like Bobby's going for games and hobbies as well so a lot of our listeners are kind of voting for us one day and voting for him another day which is cool.
2446914	2453760	Under Station Live I think is making a push for Most Original which can't think of a better title for what they do over there.
2453800	2455441	I think that would be awesome if they got that.
2455841	2456902	So check that out again.
2456962	2460045	That's part of Stitcher Radio at Stitcher.com and we would appreciate
2460645	2486387	your consideration during award season just you know it the exposure helps grow our family as I say at the end of every show we don't ask for your money we don't ask for anything just help spread the word about just your soul yeah just your eternal soul all right let's get into gaming news though that's what you really came here for you didn't come here to hear me promo all this stuff you want to hear about gaming news and us riffing on it so uh Loki oh wait wait
2487268	2490410	Do we have a... Okay, BlackWolf has the determination.
2490810	2492951	He was like, do Google Play cards exist?
2493152	2493492	They do.
2493732	2494152	Yeah, they do.
2494212	2494933	I know I've seen them too.
2495273	2497754	And BlackWolf says, then I guess they can has.
2498074	2499835	So you heard it here first.
2499996	2501496	Add it into the raffle this month.
2501556	2502597	Google Play if you want.
2503097	2503538	If you want.
2505539	2505839	All right.
2507820	2508881	Now let's get into gaming news.
2508921	2509101	Loki.
2509780	2517144	Yes, so this week everybody was up in arms because Content ID started going crazy.
2517885	2518945	It became self-aware.
2519386	2525829	Now, it started flagging a ton of videos, even more so than normal.
2526309	2530372	And this is mainly because they opened it up from just, you know...
2531633	2533976	and so on.
2549196	2560007	First off, YouTube made a comment on it and basically said, nothing illustrates the incredible growth and evolution of YouTube better than the enterprise class.
2560047	2561468	Okay, this is all PR speak, by the way.
2561748	2562589	I just want to interrupt that.
2563570	2567774	As these networks grow, we are making products and blah, blah, blah.
2567794	2568275	Let's see here.
2569055	2574520	It is part of our commitment to ensure that all enterprise partners can continue to thrive and be successful on YouTube.
2574680	2576381	Okay, that's a whole bunch of bullshit.
2576401	2580645	Basically, they said that, yes, those content ID things that went out were not a mistake.
2580865	2582286	They are real.
2584181	2584481	So there.
2585222	2598590	And a lot of the problem is, you know, these videos, you know, for those not aware of the Content ID service, you know, I'm sure you'll probably hear from, you know, anybody that you follow on YouTube or, you know, a ton of people, you know, especially in the blogs recently.
2598630	2606616	It's basically this way of automating the process of finding, you know, videos out there that inflict or that...
2608097	2610579	have copyrighted material within them.
2610839	2615863	And so the way it works is they have a 30-second sample or sample of their song.
2615883	2620507	I think it's like the first 30 seconds or video.
2620747	2621908	And it can be submitted to this service.
2621988	2627893	And it basically checks the waveforms or whatever to see if they match this ID.
2628173	2630155	Think of it like an MD5 tag or something like that.
2630235	2632997	It checks to make sure that this is what this is.
2633657	2648668	some of our just to give some perspective some of our videos on the Orange Lounge Radio YouTube account have been flagged like old videos like things I don't really care about that were us playing DDR at E3 and like the song that's being played in DDR content matches
2648988	2667277	so even though we're filming off it because you know E3 is loud and has that background noise and even though we're filming off the TV it's still content matches which you know whatever like I really don't you know care I mean to be fair we were showing video of someone else's game not trying to really like monetize that or whatever but it's just kind of one of those eye roll things you know yeah
2667957	2685132	Um, and, you know, the other thing, well, like I said, it's automated because before this content ID, you know, thing existed, it would be up to the content holders, you know, like Warner Brothers or whoever, you know, to actually go and find those videos and flag them manually.
2685452	2689996	It was a very manual process and they bitched and moaned at saying, oh, look at all this stuff's getting, you know, copyrighted, there's...
2690516	2696017	Full episodes of shows and stuff on YouTube and this needs to be taken care of or else we're going to sue you.
2696097	2701738	And so that's where they came up with this content ID thing and now everyone's getting flagged.
2701978	2703979	The problem is though it's automated.
2704039	2707699	It's not necessarily done by these companies.
2707739	2711560	So for example, say Capcom or something like that.
2712280	2717121	Sure, they probably have their materials in there because they don't want someone infringing upon that stuff.
2717721	2720284	but they may be okay with you putting that stuff in there.
2720304	2721065	Which Capcom is.
2721166	2721886	Yeah, which they are.
2722327	2736444	And so there's still, you know, you have to go through the whole process of, you know, basically contesting it and then, you know, it gets sent to the Capcom or their legal team and they have to either say, you know,
2737924	2743468	Yes, we agree this is an error or no, this really is infringing and stuff.
2743688	2748851	And it can lead to copyright flags or copyright strikes.
2749011	2750932	Three strikes and, of course, you're gone.
2751133	2756076	Your videos are gone and you're not going to be using that YouTube account anymore to make money.
2758897	2761219	It's really annoying.
2761279	2763420	I know, personally, I've had to deal with some of this stuff.
2764320	2771224	I had a video that I made that was just some tutorial for Grand Theft Auto map editing and stuff.
2771364	2774786	I didn't have any music in the background, but there was no audio there.
2774846	2779189	YouTube said, hey, here's some pre-approved tracks that you can use.
2779669	2781830	Using their own service, I picked one of those tracks.
2781850	2782571	It got flagged.
2783351	2783851	Oh, wow.
2805885	2806345	Thanks for watching!
2824338	2828442	I have a huge... This really irritates the piss out of me.
2828722	2836130	What's going on with that where other people are putting in their content ID and it's not even stuff that they really own.
2836770	2839133	That's what needs to be come down hard on.
2840654	2845399	These companies that put in these content claims for things they don't really own.
2846440	2868146	that that needs to stop and YouTube needs to come down hard and fast on that but they won't and that's that's gonna be this is gonna be a very interesting turning point because you've got a lot of very angry people about this because you know there's people that make their living off of YouTube videos and you know as much as you might want to say get a real job or things like that video editing is a bitch
2868686	2879794	There's a reason I don't really like to put OLR on video, and I'm very thankful to our own VXJasonXV because he's the sucker that signed up and said, sure, I'll edit the videos to put it up on YouTube or whatever.
2879914	2884998	So thank you, Jason, because ain't nobody got time for that as far as I'm concerned.
2885018	2886059	I got other things I want to do.
2887380	2888561	It's such a pain to edit videos.
2888581	2891743	So these people that do edit video and do work on it, you know what?
2891803	2892644	If you're going to watch it,
2895143	2899543	I think the author can make like a tenth of a cent or whatever they get from the ad that shows in the beginning.
2899867	2909349	A lot of the people who have been making their money that way, like Classic Game Room, I think the Cine Massacre stuff, they've already left YouTube for other places.
2909850	2913230	And SF Debris, I think, went to Vimeo or this other one.
2913410	2915331	I don't think Vimeo allows gaming content.
2915391	2916511	No, it's not for gaming.
2916731	2920372	It was the guy who does the Star Trek and Doctor Who reviews.
2921793	2922073	Probably.
2922673	2927554	I think he went to Vimeo or he went to one other one, but he's been off of YouTube for a while now.
2928615	2935000	It's not good though because I mean, yeah, we're talking about the gaming portion of it, but I'm sure that not just gaming is affected by it.
2935040	2940945	Like a ton of people are affected by it, you know, especially just all sorts of content producers and that's not good.
2940985	2942426	I mean, it's not sending them a good message.
2942466	2950852	It's basically saying you're... And it's bad enough that once they do, you know, content ID you or whatever, they flag your video.
2951613	2953233	You're not making revenue on that video anymore.
2953433	2958175	The person who ever flagged it, they just assume that, whatever, they're making money off of it.
2958195	2959235	Nintendo does that.
2959495	2964936	They're so generous, and they allow you to keep your video up so that they can make money off of it.
2964996	2966057	I mean, it's just ridiculous.
2966417	2969117	I monetize the videos on my channel, Rob Roberts Plays.
2969277	2975539	I sign up for the monetization and whatever, and I realize it's kind of shaky ground with copyright because I am playing...
2976539	2979320	Other people's games, but they're old games.
2979720	2982681	I like to think I'm kind of educating and bringing light to it, whatever.
2983021	2986082	The amount of money, trust me, the amount of money is ridiculous.
2986102	2986322	Exactly.
2986462	2987042	That's the thing.
2987402	2992544	I also don't have any disillusions that I'm going to make a shit ton of money off this and quit my job.
2992844	2995325	No, that's not going to happen, and I'm totally fine with that.
2995645	3002887	But it's the kind of thing where I'm like, hey, if maybe one of the videos were to end up going viral and I can get money to afford a new microphone, then great.
3003847	3008489	We do spend money out of our own pockets to do this show and VOG and all that.
3009089	3012270	If I told you how much I spend on my own money on this shit, you'd probably be surprised.
3012710	3013250	That's okay.
3013290	3014290	I'm not trying to yield anybody.
3014410	3015271	That's my hobby.
3015451	3017311	A lot of people spend money on their hobbies.
3017391	3021833	If your hobby is remote control car racing, you probably drop a lot of money into that.
3021913	3022593	Yes, Stan does.
3022613	3022853	Right?
3022873	3024673	So that's what I'm saying.
3024693	3025334	This is my hobby.
3025374	3026054	I drop money into it.
3026094	3026474	That's fine.
3026694	3027374	Same with pinball.
3027554	3029475	If I can recoup a little bit of that, then great.
3030055	3033498	But, you know, I realized too with the Let's Plays, this is a slippery slope.
3033638	3039503	I recently did a Let's Remember video for The Legend of Zelda on NES, and you know that shit got flagged.
3039623	3042486	And I was just kind of one of those, I just rolled my eyes and like, whatever.
3043006	3044467	Whatever, fine, I don't care.
3044868	3047070	Oh no, 30 cents lost, what am I gonna do?
3047890	3054356	Well, one thing, Bobby just linked in chat about Jonathan Blow being flagged for posting his own game.
3055241	3056682	Ooh, see that's really not good.
3056702	3060743	That shows a real problem with the content ID matching system though.
3060863	3063664	And GameGuru pointed out that it was SF Debris went to blip.
3064764	3066224	I knew it was one of those other ones.
3066545	3072666	Those comments from live.vognetwork.com SSJ100Matt saying there is going to be and should be a great exodus from YouTube.
3073087	3075967	People are going to start getting fed up with their flagging and content policies.
3076327	3079228	If many of the big time YouTube channels started leaving, people will follow.
3079568	3084390	Let's be honest, YouTube is not a particularly difficult to steal technology.
3085110	3087652	There's tons of other companies that do the whole video embedding thing.
3088132	3092836	So it just kind of takes somebody stepping up and saying, yes, we welcome the gaming content.
3092856	3096859	A lot of people assuming that Twitch would jump on that real quick.
3097119	3102162	It would make sense because they already have ways that you can highlight and create a video on demand thing.
3102563	3105985	They just don't have a way where you can upload your own videos that I know of.
3106085	3108247	Maybe you can, and I just haven't really looked at that.
3109768	3123497	but needless to say the focus on Twitch TV certainly isn't video on demand but this is a huge opportunity for them if a competitor wanted to come in for Twitch TV this is a great way to get their foot in the door but I think the problem is and this is I don't
3124177	3124838	and DarkSakura.com.
3148115	3158201	Don't get me wrong, I understand if I take a track from some CD or something and blatantly put that up there in CD quality on YouTube, okay, that is infringing.
3158422	3159182	That's ridiculous.
3159802	3162024	Which is weird because I see that shit all the time.
3163471	3163891	All the time.
3163951	3167552	I could go find a top 40 hit, bring up the YouTube and play it right now.
3167572	3170373	Although now I know we're putting our shows on YouTube, I better not.
3171554	3173794	But I see videos all the time.
3173934	3175055	Or full-length movies.
3175275	3178876	I watched The Flight of the Navigator the other day on YouTube.
3179036	3179636	Get the fuck out.
3179676	3180516	That video's on YouTube?
3180536	3181537	Yes, it is.
3181557	3182097	I love that movie.
3182117	3183677	That movie was awesome.
3183797	3185978	I watch documentaries all the time on YouTube.
3186488	3187209	Freakin' Addictin'
3216529	3231342	The problem is the system is just not... I think a good compromise, and even still this isn't perfect, it would be... Let's say that a video comes out and... Let's just use an example of Nintendo.
3231863	3232483	Nintendo...
3234480	3238325	doesn't like the fact that you're using their video or something like that.
3238345	3239587	They're going to monetize it or whatever.
3239847	3243652	I think that you should be able to split the revenue between what you've done and them.
3244193	3246676	I think that's a perfectly acceptable solution.
3247517	3251783	It gets a little complicated when you're talking music and stuff like that.
3252243	3262867	The music one is a real tricky slope though, because to some extent I think the artists licensed their music for that game, they did not expect all this other stuff.
3263588	3273251	I mean, this is maybe how music needs to be licensed going forward, but I can kind of see a little bit more where these games with these very AAA soundtracks, it's a really slippery slope.
3273892	3274692	I kind of get that.
3276918	3304521	um the other thing I was gonna say is you know just because a lot of these companies or and I don't necessarily like that I don't blame those companies because a lot of them were like dude we don't know what's going on either I mean we just you know started to hear about this you know let us know if your video got flagged and you know or you know go ahead and you know object to it and we'll uh you know we'll go ahead and you know flag it and let it go through and stuff we we want you to have that stuff out there but um
3305602	3316770	I was going to say, there are lists out there of actual games that people will let you play and they want you to play at different publishers.
3317350	3318511	A lot of the MMOs.
3318691	3319712	Blizzard games.
3319792	3321873	Yeah, there's a Wikia, for example.
3321933	3325055	Wikia called letsplaylist.wikia.com
3326036	3347240	and they even have a whole you know hashtag on Twitter who who lets play and those are all companies that will let you basically play their games and they're fine with you monetizing it usually and it will I think it will even let you know if if they you know allow that and stuff and
3347880	3365210	and I mean like you know like for example like Minecraft you can do that I want to say even I was surprised you know Rockstar they're fine with you doing Grand Theft Auto and you know that kind of stuff in there so there are companies out there and I think if that's going to be if they're going to really if these I
3366471	3366911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3393988	3397789	CodeMan in chat, speaking of live streaming and so forth.
3397849	3402350	CodeMan over at live.vognetwork.com says, Twitch will eventually be in the same boat.
3402830	3405531	It's becoming more popular and copyright laws will hit it.
3405891	3413533	It's sad that these things were made to share experiences with people and a few rotten apples screwed up for the bunch.
3413633	3414534	I think he meant to say it's sad.
3414974	3415174	But...
3416614	3427646	Yeah, it's interesting though, because now Twitch is in this really interesting boat where, well, but they're a part, they are literally integrated into PlayStation 4 now, and will be soon on Xbox One, or at least they certainly have that channel already.
3428026	3435474	Nintendo, not so much, but Nintendo kind of does their own thing with online, you know, they're not looking to get Twitch on there anytime soon.
3436154	3442519	Um, but because now that Twitch is integrated into the consoles, it's going to make that kind of, it makes it a really weird thing.
3442579	3446662	Like, I can't see gaming companies suddenly coming after Twitch when Twitch is a part of the console.
3448323	3451885	It's kind of like if you put a game out on the PlayStation 4, you know that that's going to happen.
3452386	3458170	Although, from my understanding is, of course, game companies can turn it on and off, but who's going to be that dick company to turn it off?
3461368	3471020	I don't think anybody's in a rush to be the first to have that notorious distinction of you can't stream it on PlayStation 4 granted I guess Playroom's already in that boat but for other reasons completely
3474009	3476010	Anything else on the YouTube dramas you want to share, Loki?
3477431	3482894	No, I'm just more interested to see how this is going to fall out, I guess.
3483414	3484415	You know, see the reaction.
3484435	3486376	Because it only happened late last week.
3486856	3492319	And I don't know if we've really heard a lot from publishers.
3492459	3496961	I mean, YouTube's kind of said their thing.
3497041	3497762	But I don't know.
3497782	3499042	It would be interesting to see what...
3500203	3503785	What steps are going to be taken if people are planning on moving elsewhere?
3504426	3505206	Or what's going to happen?
3506927	3515072	Speaking of PlayStation 4 streaming, BlackWolf says, I believe NBA 2K14 turns off the sound on the streams and captures, so it's all silent.
3515092	3518774	And that probably has to do with, you know, because a game like that's got a huge soundtrack behind it.
3519074	3520475	Those EA sports games always do.
3520655	3522576	So that wouldn't surprise me.
3523016	3525418	But you'd think that they would still be able to do game audio.
3525498	3527499	Yeah, the game audio you think would be there.
3528599	3555845	yeah alright, anyhow going to another story really what they should do and this is the appropriate solution for NBA 2K14 is to really just substitute all the music in the game with Space Jam Space Jam the entire time that would be the perfect solution or I believe I can fly or I believe I can fly amazing
3558021	3563423	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SHELL.
3564043	3564343	All right.
3566064	3569265	Moving on to some games that won't be showing up on PlayStation 4.
3569305	3570546	They probably won't show up anywhere.
3570686	3575347	It's 38 Studios, the big studio that went bankrupt.
3575648	3583931	That was one of the baseball player guy owned, and then they made Kingdoms of Amalur, and then they shut down, and it left the state of Rhode Island with a big...
3587252	3592635	Well, the auction happened this week to sell off some of their IPs and the trademarks and so forth.
3592695	3593296	And get this.
3594176	3600079	No buyer found for Project Copernicus, which was the MMO project they were working on.
3600800	3604542	No buyer found for the sequel rights to Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning.
3604662	3605903	Nobody wanted to buy it.
3606483	3606803	A dollar.
3607444	3610445	Yeah, well, I think you have to have what they call a reasonable price.
3610465	3611966	You have to be a reasonable... Two dollars?
3612166	3613007	Two dollars.
3613667	3615169	I think I've got some peanuts too.
3616891	3619674	38 Studios had their own social media platform called Helios.
3620275	3621136	No buyer.
3622317	3624300	Intellectual Property Rights for Catan.
3624780	3625281	No buyer.
3625861	3627283	And the big huge game engine.
3627804	3628324	No buyer.
3628905	3629906	Did they sell anything?
3629986	3630746	Yes, they did.
3630846	3638852	They sold a lot that included Rise of Nations and Rise of Legends, those games and the associated intellectual properties.
3639333	3645757	And then the other one that they sold was for the Big Huge Games trademark itself, which is kind of a catchy name for a game studio.
3646018	3647739	Catan would have been fun.
3647819	3648680	I like Catan.
3648700	3649980	Well, they already had Catan.
3650121	3650821	Yeah, I know.
3650841	3651241	They did it.
3651762	3653403	It was for the rights for that.
3653643	3653823	Yeah.
3654944	3663627	But anyway, apparently there were, I guess, five parties that were actually participating in the auction, but over 20 parties had expressed interest.
3663987	3676132	Anyhow, what did sell went for $320,000, which might not sound too bad, but apparently Rhode Island, the debt they owe Rhode Island, $100 million.
3676212	3676692	So that's...
3677372	3680093	practically pennies on the debt that they actually owe.
3680953	3681173	Ouch.
3682013	3688734	Apparently, the state will continue to negotiate with interested parties to try to sell that which was unsold thus far.
3689834	3690134	Yikes.
3691435	3694295	Maybe the state of Rhode Island could turn into Big Huge Games.
3695375	3698416	You know, just... Big Island.
3698456	3699296	Big Island games.
3699976	3700376	Why not?
3700956	3701656	Big Island?
3701756	3702156	Big?
3702337	3702677	Really?
3702857	3703157	Yeah.
3704077	3704957	Is it really an island?
3705915	3706295	Not really.
3706936	3709557	And its name wasn't really Rhode Island either.
3709597	3715599	Rhode Island's short for its full name, which is... Oh, God, I'm going to make myself look stupid.
3715619	3716379	Rocky Rhode Island.
3716419	3719620	No, it's Rhode Island and something plantations.
3722722	3723302	That's okay.
3723382	3724702	How about we just move on?
3725323	3727283	No, because I don't want to look stupid here on OLR.
3727383	3729564	You're just going on Wikipedia.
3730345	3732125	I'm from California, all right?
3733346	3733606	That's okay.
3733626	3734946	I don't know what the crap it means.
3735006	3737327	The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.
3737647	3739348	That's the full name of the state.
3740003	3740303	DarkSakura.com
3762841	3766182	They're going to have to sell the state to get out of debt for that game.
3766382	3768922	They're going to have to get a triple mortgage on their state.
3769222	3769582	Oh, God.
3769622	3770203	This just in.
3770243	3772003	Rhode Island is now a part of New Jersey.
3774443	3776384	I don't think that they'd stoop that low.
3777124	3777464	Sorry.
3777504	3778164	Love you, New Jersey.
3778424	3778984	Kidding.
3779024	3779825	She's kidding, people.
3779845	3780265	Kidding.
3780445	3780785	All right.
3781045	3782165	So how about terrorism?
3782325	3784425	The state of Rhode Island and New Jersey plantations.
3784766	3785646	How about terrorism?
3785866	3786126	All right.
3786146	3786526	How about it?
3787506	3789887	Well, the NSA has a new bestie.
3790427	3791107	You know who it is?
3792187	3792527	Wow.
3795388	3801130	The NSA is going on World of Warcraft and other online games to look for terrorists.
3801230	3803690	Because this is America and we're afraid of terrorists.
3804551	3804851	I guess.
3806391	3810214	It's not just American agencies as well, it's British agencies too.
3810415	3816059	So apparently it's this whole Anglo-Saxon descent stupidity thing, I don't know.
3817000	3827208	So the NSA and the Government Communications Headquarters in the UK have been monitoring activity and harvesting data from World of Warcraft and Second Life.
3828088	3841730	and apparently some other games that they're trying to see if they're I guess if terrorists are trying to fish for information through MMOs just by posing as a regular player.
3842991	3845391	I think that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of in my life.
3846191	3855693	I think that our tax money could be spent on better things and I want to know if they worked out anything with Blizzard to actually set that up or any of these other ones.
3856560	3858081	I think Blizzard came out and said they didn't know.
3881235	3891741	It just seems to me that they are really just picking anything that they can.
3892681	3901046	But they said that basically where they got the legal ability to do that was because of a 1981 executive order signed by Ronald Reagan.
3902306	3908271	You know, not only did he ruin our economy, he also did that too, that gave it authority to collect the data.
3908932	3912915	So privacy groups are basically, you know, stepping in and what?
3913462	3914643	He was a real forward thinker.
3916204	3917806	And the ability to spy on World of Warcraft.
3917866	3920928	I don't know what World of Warcraft is, but someday this will mean something.
3924111	3930076	At any rate, and I'm just going to read this line in this article here from Computer World.
3930557	3940305	In one document from around that time, the NSA talked about how it was able to gather information on user accounts, characters, and guilds related to known Islamic extremist groups by monitoring World of Warcraft.
3940325	3940766	Really?
3940866	3941086	Really.
3943769	3944029	Really?
3945710	3945970	I can't
3967535	3968716	Well said, sir.
3968816	3969577	Well said.
3970839	3971860	Well, here's the thing.
3972560	3975864	I think part of this is overblown.
3976104	3976725	I'm going to be honest.
3976765	3984013	I think part of this is overblown because I don't think the NSA was necessarily paying a whole bunch of people to sit around in cubicles and play World of Warcraft all day.
3984313	3985795	I don't think that was quite what they were doing.
3985835	3986135	Dream job.
3986555	3989096	Were they trying to hack into it?
3989216	3989657	Possible.
3989697	3992638	I think that's probably more what's going on with our gold farms.
3992658	3998581	They said they were taking data feeds and whatnot and user logs.
3998721	4008866	But at the same time, it wouldn't be out of the question that they would have people who are actually trying to communicate with groups that were
4009366	4010887	are flagged with a certain name.
4011547	4012968	And don't hear me out here.
4012988	4018110	Just because I'm saying it's not as bad as you think, I'm not saying it's appropriate because I kind of don't agree.
4018170	4020091	Because it's like, well, what good did it do?
4021232	4022112	What did we stop?
4022153	4026515	And you know there's those people out there that are like, lol, let's do a controversial name for our guild.
4027195	4027395	Yeah.
4027615	4029496	We are, you know, Pony Jihad or something.
4029516	4031097	Yeah, there's tons of trolls online.
4031117	4032758	Good luck if they were, you know...
4033298	4034879	Spying on Xbox Live, man.
4034919	4036100	Everybody's a terrorist on there.
4036160	4036961	Here's the thing, though.
4036981	4039363	There's a difference between a terrorist and an asshole.
4039543	4044566	We've heard of people that have committed hideous crimes that happen to be World of Warcraft players.
4044666	4046167	It's an unfortunate coincidence.
4046188	4052212	And I believe, I really hope I'm not misspeaking here, but there's unfortunately so many crappy people in the world.
4052472	4052692	DarkSakura,
4072092	4073893	That question is not being answered.
4074314	4079397	And not even the Warcraft transcripts, assumably, that they subpoenaed were able to answer that question.
4079837	4085341	But my point is that they're able to get that information when they need it, when the police has it or whatever.
4085361	4090204	But as far as prevention stuff goes, we're not seeing that anything was prevented.
4090845	4092185	Because that guy did what he did.
4092345	4094467	His chat log would be like, LFR sucks.
4095456	4096577	It's probably not very interesting.
4096597	4097277	Dot's running out.
4097297	4097758	Yeah.
4098938	4099799	This tank sucks.
4100039	4100779	Yeah, he'll please.
4101640	4102601	He'll please, yeah, thank you.
4102721	4109685	But, yeah, it's just... But... I don't know where I was going with this.
4109765	4110486	The whole thing's just...
4111980	4112521	DarkSakura.com
4130816	4132177	I remembered what it was I wanted to say.
4132357	4137342	One thing you should be aware of is that your conversations that you have in these MMOs, they're not private.
4137422	4138704	They are being tracked.
4139144	4145770	And if something ever happened to you or you did something, they will get the records and look at every chat you've had.
4146251	4149454	And that could be whether you were cybering with somebody or what.
4149834	4152997	I mean, the stuff you do when you put that information on a server, it's not private.
4154158	4183222	emails not private really in that regard I mean you could go and subpoena those companies too and so forth so you know just be aware if you think you're having these ultra private conversations on these websites you're not nope so alright however I do have a resource for people who want to stay hidden on the internet and it's actually a tumblr called we are hidden well you could also just take that plug that's in the back of your computer that attaches to the internet and you can unplug it and there you go
4184244	4188348	I'm just saying, for people who are paranoid about that, there's a resource out there.
4189169	4191933	But if you're really paranoid about being on the internet, don't be on the internet.
4192153	4194556	I'm just saying.
4194576	4195958	Do or don't.
4196418	4202906	But with the world we live in today, you really can't not be on the internet and participate in modern society.
4203977	4204758	Well, yeah, I know.
4204838	4206779	But, you know, don't have a Facebook.
4206879	4209681	I know plenty of people that don't use Facebook or any of that stuff, you know, so.
4210581	4210822	Anyway.
4211162	4213123	Facebook is its own can of worms.
4213923	4214464	Indeed.
4214504	4216005	Did you hear that thing this week?
4216025	4224229	I don't even know if it's true or not, but that Facebook actually can see, like, if you type a status and you delete it, they still track, like, what you were going to post.
4225270	4228632	Like, they were doing some type of weird, like, tracking thing behind the scenes.
4228652	4229933	I swear I saw some article on that.
4229953	4231674	It's going to be a lot of me bitching about people.
4231914	4235096	Well, yeah, and I'm thinking like, wow, mine's going to be really awful.
4237497	4240699	I write a lot of very angry things that I delete and don't post on Facebook.
4240879	4241860	It's like a good little vent.
4242340	4244241	So I need to go back to LiveJournal if that's the case.
4244281	4244742	LiveJournal.
4244762	4245922	Let's all go back to LiveJournal.
4246543	4248744	LiveJournal is going to be like, what the hell are all these people?
4248944	4249925	Oh, Facebook, right.
4251409	4256611	Bobby Blackwolf, our pal in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, sure you can participate in modern society without the internet.
4256731	4257811	Old people do it all the time.
4258831	4259632	Even my mom.
4259672	4261072	That's hardly modern society, Bob.
4261092	4263013	My mom's on Twitter, for God's sake.
4265213	4268354	Rob, I want to see what Ellen is tweeting about, Rob.
4269135	4270175	How do I join the Twitters?
4272594	4273174	I love your mom.
4273254	4273615	All right.
4274635	4275176	Let's move on.
4275236	4275516	Loki.
4276657	4278017	All right.
4279478	4280259	So let's see.
4280319	4284762	Let's talk a little bit about... I just lost... What happened here?
4285562	4286323	Something moved.
4286343	4287663	The NSA.
4288244	4289224	Damn you, NSA.
4289605	4292066	No, let's talk a little bit about SteamOS.
4292086	4292947	That just came out.
4292967	4294968	Well, at least they have the beta test out there.
4295336	4313074	and they also shipped out those 300 steam machines sadly not to my house I am disappointed but yes you can actually check it out if you don't have a steam machine to test out on you can download it now and yeah
4315123	4323428	Of course, one of the things about the Steam OS is they're not trying to be a replacement for your own OS that you have right now.
4323728	4327790	But it is a good, I guess, alternative for gaming or something.
4328811	4329551	But check it out.
4330371	4335714	And they even have... Those Steam machines out there, they sound pretty sweet.
4335734	4337815	And they came in like a wooden crate and everything.
4338296	4340417	I'm so fucking disappointed that I didn't get one.
4340917	4341978	Second to use a new computer.
4342058	4342438	Yeah, I know.
4342458	4344940	I was really sad I didn't get one either, but it is what it is.
4347662	4350263	Have we heard anything about people that are actually using SteamOS?
4350283	4354586	Because I know it's out there, but I'm not hearing a lot of reviews on it or anything, like how it works.
4355147	4355907	I haven't heard anything yet.
4355927	4360750	I guess a lot of people are just hesitant to use it because it's like, well, I'm not going to exactly overwrite Windows with SteamOS.
4360790	4364213	So if you don't have a second computer for it, then what can you do?
4364233	4369977	Well, not necessarily because I think you can multi-boot into that stuff and do it that way.
4371177	4397113	but I'm not really sure how I haven't messed with Steam or I haven't messed with Linux in a long time last time I tried to mess with Linux is when I heard that Linux would allow me to somehow mount the file system on some DDR disk I don't remember, something had to do with Dance Dance Revolution hacking that but uh yeah that was that um
4397822	4398202	All right.
4398783	4400163	Well, I'm going to try to move on.
4400203	4403245	For our live listeners, the podcasts only will hear this.
4403325	4404946	Our live stream just dropped completely.
4404986	4406527	We can't connect to our streaming server.
4406887	4410529	So it's not even my internet because I still see IRC and everything and everybody's freaking out.
4410549	4411410	But I can't even connect.
4411770	4412911	The NSA shut us down.
4413311	4414272	Apparently they did.
4415072	4415732	Jamie, would you mind?
4415752	4416853	We're going to flip the script a little bit.
4416873	4418114	Would you go to your story next?
4418234	4419635	I suppose I could do such a thing.
4419735	4423517	While I try to fix what's going on here, even though it might be out of my control.
4426000	4440178	Firefly Online is going to be a thing and it is launching in summer 2014 by developer QMX and it's going to be on iOS and Android but they are going to be expanding onto PC and Mac and may include other platforms.
4440958	4462325	So, there's not a lot of information out other than soon, but basically it's going to be you get your ship, you get your crew, you have to keep them happy, you have to trade, craft, collect, fly around the verse, and you also have a freeform flight simulator built into it.
4463145	4484820	and uh they're basically uh saying that it's going to be uh you know when you start off you're basically going to be kind of another version of the Firefly crew you play as a brown coat captain and then you get other factions through later DLC releases but um it sounds kind of fun I'm looking forward to it I might play it because I love Firefly it's the Joss
4485120	4496570	This is really cool news for those that were, because, you know, obviously, that show had a huge cult to it, and people want to see it come back, and they want to see, you know, what's... The comic's coming out, too.
4496911	4497171	Yeah.
4497251	4498652	That's based after the movie.
4498752	4503076	But, I mean, what a nice way to kind of at least continue the story, because we all know, like, the show can't come back.
4503176	4504578	All those actors are on to new things.
4504598	4505959	Like, it just, it's not going to happen.
4505979	4508982	Wasn't Marina Baccarin, like, super pregnant right now?
4509002	4509422	Uh-huh.
4509722	4510823	I think she's super pregnant right now.
4510843	4511324	I think so, yeah.
4512466	4513987	Although her hair grew back.
4514588	4515809	She had long hair in the last picture I saw.
4516069	4521052	But I think this is a great way for people to at least continue that.
4522013	4524535	It's weird to me that an MMO for Firefly didn't happen sooner.
4525236	4525897	Thanks for watching!
4548280	4552262	Why you're nothing but firefly pieces of pudding sitting on a plate.
4552803	4553763	You're custard!
4554684	4569853	No, but for people who are really into doing things in that universe, there actually is a tabletop game that I want to say, well, the former White Wolf put out, because I think it's the same type of gameplay system as Werewolf and Vampire, those ones.
4570713	4577197	And like I said, there's a comic going to be coming out that's based on the Fallout after the Serenity movie.
4577897	4582439	So it seems that that universe is getting a lot of love lately.
4585480	4591602	You think the fact that the Avengers is doing well and all that helps kind of bump up Whedon's properties?
4592262	4592842	It's Joss.
4593263	4595143	People who love Joss love Joss regardless.
4596124	4602486	And for the record, I was never a big Buffy fan and I didn't like Angel until its last season because that was when the writers stopped giving a fuck.
4603186	4604687	That was when we had the Puppet Time episode.
4605527	4634587	but I loved Firefly I didn't watch Dollhouse but I've liked Joss's writing when he wrote for Astonishing X-Men that's probably the most I've enjoyed any X-Men title like since the Dark Phoenix stuff when I was a little kid so our stream did come back for the live listeners welcome back apparently it was not our fault I don't know what's up with that but anyway going to some comments in our chat room SSJ100 Matt says this still seems like an April Fool's joke is it a joke?
4635251	4635511	ESGN ESPN
4657658	4660180	ESGN, ESports Global Network
4678994	4681517	E-sports, of course, is a lot of the head-to-head combat.
4681537	4684501	You see some of the big games that support this right now.
4684561	4686904	League of Legends, Dota 2, of course.
4686924	4688125	Those MOBAs are huge for this.
4688486	4691489	StarCraft 2, World of Warcraft Arena.
4691810	4694313	You see a lot of this being e-sports.
4695494	4697796	We've talked a little bit about this on my other show, Horde House, as well.
4698056	4701359	You're seeing now people are getting visas to come into the U.S.
4702680	4709145	We just had a guy for StarCraft II got a visa to come in on that game this week to play that, so that's pretty cool.
4710186	4718292	Anyhow, ESGN will be launching at ESGN.com, and ESGNTV.com is the video site for its dedicated 24-hour channel.
4718672	4723076	Again, it is not something that's planned to be on standard television, quote-unquote, but...
4723576	4729264	What is standard TV anymore in the world of Netflix and Hulu and YouTube and all that?
4729345	4731147	So this is going to be a very interesting experiment.
4731528	4732269	Good luck to them.
4732369	4733310	And you know...
4734324	4743308	I know we don't talk a lot about StarCraft 2 and League of Legends on this show, but if y'all need three fun and fabulous commentators on a Sunday night, we might be available.
4744389	4745309	Just say if the money's right.
4745969	4746550	If the money's right.
4748110	4750872	All joking aside, let's get to the release dates.
4750932	4754273	Travel the world and check out what's coming out in a gaming store near you.
4754413	4756174	Probably not a lot, right, Loki?
4756654	4757615	Or not a thing.
4757875	4758675	Not a thing, huh?
4759015	4759515	Not a thing.
4759555	4760616	We are done for the year.
4762034	4762796	In the US, right?
4762816	4763336	In the US.
4763377	4763697	In the US.
4763777	4768486	I mean, aside from, you know, digital stuff obviously coming out, but nothing at retail.
4769079	4769439	Dragon Dragoon 3
4792491	4802699	A brand new DualShock controller in crystal color comes out, as well as FIFA 14 World Class Soccer Bonus Edition, and Shin Gundam Musou comes out this week as well.
4803199	4805741	And there's still some heavy hitters in Japan the rest of the year.
4805981	4817590	The day after Christmas, Boxing Day, if you will, for Canada, in Japan they're getting Final Fantasy X and X-2's remasters are out on December 26th, so just barely making it this year, so...
4818530	4820132	Still plenty to come over there.
4820252	4825976	On the Xbox 360, Band Fused, Rock Legends is there as well, as well as Shooting Love Collection.
4826736	4831920	And going over to the Vita, on the PlayStation Vita this week, Amnesia V Edition.
4832440	4835943	Is that the same Amnesia that is the scary game that we have here?
4836263	4836903	I don't think it is.
4837704	4838224	It is not.
4838345	4841707	This is more based off an anime, I believe, with a lot of cards.
4842267	4842808	Looks like this guy...
4844389	4845610	Where did all my cards go?
4845630	4846490	Where did these come from?
4846710	4848351	I don't know.
4850152	4851733	There's a crap ton on the Vita this week.
4852074	4853875	Dead or Alive 5 gets a price reduction.
4854615	4857857	Diabolic Lovers Limited V Edition comes out this week.
4858718	4864662	Geki Johan Mahou Shoujo Madoka That's Magica The Battle Pentagram comes out this week.
4864862	4869265	That's a big anime series that half my friends on Tumblr are losing their shit over.
4869545	4873167	Hakoyuki Kuyokoroku Injustice Kudwafter Kudwafter
4889235	4889676	Fuck Yes Madoka
4908534	4911096	Shin Gundam Musou comes out this week on the Vita as well.
4911276	4911976	Yay, Gundam.
4912156	4913337	Busy, busy week on the Vita.
4913497	4917039	On the Wii U, nothing, sorry.
4918340	4926405	On the Nintendo 3DS, however, High School D x D, Koneku no Album, My Little Cat comes out in Japan.
4926505	4927786	It's a kiddie game.
4927806	4928646	I have to see what this is.
4929587	4930267	Oh, my God.
4930568	4931168	Oh, my God.
4931188	4932489	I am flailing.
4932529	4933389	This looks amazing.
4933489	4934490	I need this in my life.
4934510	4935551	I need this in my life.
4936691	4939653	Someone get me a Japanese 3DS.
4939773	4940053	Okay.
4941113	4943074	It looks like... It's kitties in fancy hats.
4943134	4950938	It looks like real pictures of cats in like sailor suits and pink hats and like orange Halloween sweaters.
4950958	4952739	And they don't even look like they're going to murder you.
4952919	4955660	So, this is what it comes to.
4956061	4958642	This is why Swapnil was removed.
4960429	4964798	I'm going to link that to our chatters right now so they can take a look at that.
4965259	4967644	The chat room is harassing me into watching Madoka.
4968692	4969473	I need this in my life.
4969493	4976136	So that means that's going to be the next thing I have to marathon since I marathoned all of Shingeki no Kyojin so far and Claymore.
4976336	4977297	Who makes this game?
4977657	4978298	MTO.
4978538	4980019	I don't recognize that name.
4980459	4982180	I'm looking on the box art.
4982260	4983621	Everybody loves MTO.
4984161	4985302	Do they have a Twitter or something?
4985322	4986262	Because I want this game.
4986562	4987923	We need to petition for that.
4988323	4992045	Like, oh my god, thank you for posting a picture of Redertainment.
4992766	4996168	We need to harass them like we did for President Cat.
4998322	4999863	Which I still want to play that game too.
5001844	5003925	Oh my god, I want that in my life.
5005446	5007487	Koneko no Album, My Little Cat.
5008927	5009868	Koneko means kitten.
5010868	5014690	So it's like, I wonder if it's just like you take pictures of your own cat and then this program helps you.
5014730	5016371	Putting Midna in outfits!
5016851	5018352	Oh my god, that's gonna be great!
5018812	5019413	I know, right?
5020820	5021500	You guys.
5021640	5022721	I don't know what to do with you.
5023761	5027302	By the way, did you know that A Legend of Zelda The Link Between Worlds is still not out in Japan?
5027362	5029083	They will not be getting that until December 26th.
5029263	5032003	I need to put Midna in a frilly little dress.
5032844	5034844	She's going to murder the shit out of me in my sleep.
5035244	5036545	She's not going to drop this all night.
5036745	5038105	This is going to be Midna.
5038525	5038966	Mom!
5039466	5039906	Mom!
5040306	5040686	Mom!
5041066	5041606	This sucks.
5042907	5043927	Because that's how she talks.
5044007	5045528	Is AkumaJP helping us out here?
5045588	5046768	What's this link he just gave us?
5047768	5048489	I don't know.
5048509	5054353	But I know AkumaJP is over there and maybe can... Are... Is this... Oh my god!
5054773	5057635	They're ID pictures and you can make one look like a Bosozoku.
5058776	5060277	This is outstanding.
5061559	5063580	Okay, somebody get me a Japanese 3DS and this game.
5063620	5066442	This has to do with cats being adorable.
5066823	5068584	The internet would eat this shit up.
5068604	5069224	Look at that picture.
5069885	5071566	It's like they're dressed up as Bosozoku.
5071586	5072306	That's so awesome.
5072406	5073107	Horrible radio.
5073147	5073847	I'm sorry, you guys.
5073887	5075428	I'm so sorry.
5075648	5083634	Maybe what I can do, I can beg Jason to maybe take some of these links and put some of the pictures in the YouTube.
5083734	5085195	And put them on our Tumblr.
5085775	5088039	or just look it up again for yourself.
5088339	5089741	Look it up for yourself, the game.
5090903	5093087	It's out there on your favorite import gaming website.
5093347	5095210	Alright, I gotta get through some PSP games though.
5095390	5095891	But you know what?
5096151	5098214	Now I'm inspired to dress up Midna on her Tumblr.
5099586	5122383	Some PSP games, as if the Vita wasn't enough, you also have After School, Colorful Step, Undou Yubu comes out this week, Lovely Quest Unlimited, Nobunaga no Yabu Sosensoku with a power-up kit comes out this week, that's a price reduction actually, and Ore no Kanojo no Uro Omote, Pure Sweetheart comes out on the PSP this week, still kicking in Japan.
5122983	5123944	DarkSakura, how about the UK?
5124634	5126434	I need the kiddie game.
5126614	5127014	I know.
5127235	5127915	Okay.
5129495	5131495	On the 18th, we have Zen Pinball 2.
5132115	5134836	And the 19th, Colossatron, Massive World Threat.
5134856	5136376	That's a cool name, Colossatron.
5136976	5140737	And then on Wii U, we have Knit Underground, K-N-Y-T-T.
5141397	5145578	And then Ridge Racer Slipstream for the Android, iPad, and iPhone.
5145958	5149719	And nothing else until... Xmas.
5150139	5150519	Xmas.
5152429	5154630	Maybe we should call it Extifermas and worship Extifer.
5155151	5156391	We might do that on Horde House this week.
5156912	5159573	We are having a holiday special on Horde House this week.
5159613	5161194	I want to be on a holiday special.
5161975	5162255	All right.
5162995	5163415	At school.
5163635	5168338	Just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, which may or may not have to do with cats.
5169219	5176683	So Sony has patented a brand new, looks like a Move controller.
5179036	5189725	The difference being that instead of having an analog stick on that one side, the main difference is it's going to have a touchpad, kind of like how they have on the Vita and on the front of the PlayStation 4 controllers.
5203576	5216335	So maybe, it makes sense if you think about it, because now they will need some sort of extra input, you know, to cover, you know, PlayStation 4 games that use the move controller.
5216756	5218658	So maybe this is what this is about.
5221434	5228139	I don't really do a lot of games use the move controller.
5228159	5237647	Are they going to start bringing it back like how they did with Resistance and Killzone and stuff where they have a giant fucking gun that looked ridiculous with the move controllers in there?
5237918	5244879	Yeah, I kind of got the feeling they were trying to kind of get rid of the move, kind of shove that under the rug or something.
5245100	5246700	That's the impression I was getting.
5247300	5247800	Yeah, maybe not.
5249520	5249981	Interesting.
5251341	5251721	Alright.
5252401	5255062	Sorry, I'm trying to do a little research on this game company that makes this game.
5255082	5257062	I found their websites and I'm trying to see if they have a Twitter.
5257082	5257962	Apparently there's a Facebook.
5258442	5259503	I'm trying to find a Twitter.
5259963	5261103	There's a dog one too!
5261912	5291313	yes there's dress your oh my gosh but the kitty one's the best okay but this is good because now I can give out this URL so the podcast listeners can be like what the hell are they freaking out about so I'm gonna I'm gonna just totally give them a free plug here on the show because they're they make games to dress up your kitties and doggies mto-power.com that's mto-power.com is the maker of these games and there's got to be a way to to send them a message and let them know we want these games in America I have hiccups now
5292403	5293532	Did the cute kitties give you...
5295778	5297399	I didn't burp on the microphone!
5298279	5301080	Burping is a good way to get rid of hiccups.
5301740	5304201	I never, ever said I was ladylike.
5305181	5305961	I know, I know.
5306362	5307202	Fuck that.
5307222	5308982	Thank you, Tigerclaw, for linking it in the chatroom.
5310583	5311763	One more story for you guys.
5311783	5314484	This is one of those gaming good news stories.
5314544	5316325	Thank heavens.
5316505	5322687	Gaming exercise games, whether you love them or you're sick of hearing about them, they do a lot of good for our community.
5323287	5327332	and a new study is out this week about Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus.
5328073	5337925	And of course, Wii Fit Plus was available on the Nintendo Wii and now they have the newer version that's on the Wii U. I believe the demo's done, but you can check that out too.
5337945	5338426	It's on the Wii U.
5338966	5347533	Well, they say that Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus improves the lives of patients with type 2 diabetes and helps control their blood sugar levels.
5348254	5355600	This is by BMC and Doctrine Disorders who carried out the trial with 220 participants for a period of 12 weeks.
5356020	5364267	Half were asked to use Wii Fit Plus for half an hour a day and the second half were under routine care and just, you know, got everything 12 weeks later.
5365889	5370858	Those that actually got the fitness game lost weight and improved their blood sugar levels.
5371246	5372026	because guess what?
5372566	5373527	They were doing exercise.
5373547	5373967	That's right.
5374107	5374307	I know.
5374607	5379248	That's kind of the thing is I kind of look at this and go, well, duh, exercise leads to good things.
5379488	5381589	So, you know, of course, this is what happened.
5381609	5385190	When you give the people the stuff for free, I guess there's more incentive to play that.
5385890	5392472	But anyhow, experts noted that the daily physical activity increased, mental health and subjective well-being increased as well.
5392972	5395713	The number of patients suffering from depression decreased.
5396553	5399794	However, interesting, a third of the patients dropped out of the trial.
5400554	5405555	Meaning that people retaining the same level of enthusiasm over a sustained period of time was difficult.
5406876	5409796	According to Dr. Richard Elliott, who's with Diabetes UK, So,
5422399	5424181	you know what whatever gets people motivated right
5437216	5443124	Well, I mean, the biggest thing is exercise and cutting out the sugar.
5444105	5445888	Because guess what diabetes is?
5446248	5447991	Problem with insulin.
5449493	5452457	Although if you have type 1 diabetes, cutting out the extra sugar is not always good for you.
5453430	5460411	Alright, well, moving on to a more simple time when we weren't really able to interact with our games, unless it was Dance Aerobics.
5460571	5462532	When Diabetes was Wilford Brimley.
5462632	5463132	That's right.
5464032	5465252	The Classic Game of the Week.
5465932	5472033	Every week, DarkSakura goes into the Classic Gaming Vault and finds one game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game.
5472614	5473854	Instead of eating all that candy.
5473914	5474914	Write the F now.
5475814	5479335	DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5479515	5480215	Poll position.
5481078	5482739	A very true classic indeed.
5482859	5483159	Yes.
5484179	5485300	Basically, it's an arcade racer.
5485320	5485700	It came out in 1982.
5485820	5490622	I love that intro music because that's the only music in the game.
5490642	5491803	That's pretty much the only music in the game.
5491843	5493523	The rest of it is just squeaky noises.
5494864	5497065	I'll keep it really low in the background just in case.
5497205	5499166	It was manufactured by Atari.
5499786	5501087	Well, worldwide by Namco.
5501207	5502447	In the U.S., it was done by Atari.
5503448	5507249	It was actually the most popular coin-op game in 1983.
5508770	5518714	So it has an upright cabinet or an environmental cockpit cabinet, which my Chuck E. Cheese's slash Showbiz Pizza in Mobile, Alabama had one forever.
5519094	5519495	And you know what?
5519535	5520655	They still fucking have it.
5521255	5521976	The same one.
5522936	5523936	I'm just surprised it works.
5525677	5529839	So basically you have the accelerator, you have a brake pedal, and you have your wheel.
5530659	5543584	So it was the highest-grossing arcade game in North America in 1983, and it sold 21,000 machines for $61 million, equivalent to 2012's $140 million.
5544024	5545324	So just put it in modern money.
5546665	5550306	The most successful racing game of its time, pretty much.
5550466	5554387	And it had a Saturday morning cartoon, which I watched the hell out of, and have every episode of downloaded.
5554947	5555728	Plus it had a cool intro.
5557308	5574991	um it uh basically pole position I think was the big inspiration for most of the modern driving games that we have now so basically in the game you have a formula one race car and you do a time trial lap to qualify for um the Fuji racetrack and uh
5576627	5577828	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5603268	5630302	and it also was had it was in full color and had scaling sprites including your race cars and your signs to give you perspective it was for the US release Namco actually approached Bally Midway to either and said okay one of you can get one of these games and so Bally took Mappy and Atari took Pole Position and
5631903	5637247	I mean, so basically, it's been probably one of the most ported systems, too.
5637788	5642231	It's been put out by Atari Soft and a lot of the home computers and consoles in the early 80s.
5643072	5648256	In the 90s, there was a pole position on PC that came back in Microsoft's return of arcade.
5648596	5651699	It's been on PlayStation, N64, and Dreamcast in the Namco Museum.
5652539	5656821	and it's also been on PS2, GameCube, GBA and Xbox.
5657641	5668265	Fuji Speedway was renamed Namco Speedway in the Museum series and for the Plug and Play series that were part of the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade it was called Blue Speedway.
5669405	5687795	and there's also a version to work with the Puffer Exercise Bike Controller and it has been put out on iPod back in the day and now we have iOS versions with Pole Position Remix and Pole Position 2, which was the sequel, has also been re-released as well.
5688295	5692998	Like I said, Pole Position 2 being the sequel, it came out in 1983 and let me see...
5697920	5699381	I hate my iPad sometimes.
5700422	5720892	As far as that, a lot of people are saying that Final Lap is the unofficial Pole Position 3, which is sort of a racing RPG spinoff that came out on the TurboGrafx-16, also known as the PC Engine.
5722232	5723913	That version was called Final Lap Twin.
5724854	5732199	As I mentioned earlier, there was Pole Position Remix for iPhone and it had the courses for Pole Position 2 and a new course.
5732720	5738003	And there was also a cartoon of the same name, like I said, that I watched a bunch of times.
5738724	5740785	And Pole Position showed up in the movie Daryl.
5742286	5744027	Remember the movie Daryl?
5744047	5744408	I do.
5744648	5745769	The boy who was an android.
5747310	5749411	And he won a very high score in that game.
5749651	5750572	So yeah, Pole Position Remix.
5751542	5751882	All right.
5752423	5752763	There it is.
5752803	5754605	Your classic game of the week.
5754806	5755767	Pole Position.
5756848	5758750	Available like 11 billion different places.
5758790	5759190	Seriously.
5759611	5760011	Seriously.
5760111	5762534	It was just because it was the most popular arcade game that year.
5762634	5763195	I remember it.
5763235	5764256	You remember it.
5764676	5765237	It's everywhere.
5765617	5766038	And you know what?
5766118	5767880	We built our old main cabinet out of a pole position.
5768200	5768460	Nice.
5769160	5769561	Very nice.
5769741	5771001	Shermie lived in it for a little while.
5771361	5772762	It was her cat condo, seriously.
5773502	5775163	That's a great use for a pole position machine.
5775183	5777964	My cat is, you know how fat Shermie was.
5777984	5778444	Yeah, of course.
5778484	5780745	I'm like, how the crap did she get in it?
5781146	5791510	She found a little door where the pedal was, and she would just live, we had this pole position machine sitting in our apartment for a year it had to be, or at least half a year, and Shermie lived in it.
5793069	5793750	Cats are amazing.
5793950	5798875	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere because when we come back there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5799055	5805061	More news, the Fuku Question of the Week, your calls, and much more when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5811448	5811748	DarkSakura.com
5831932	5834993	Well, I live in an interfaith home.
5835033	5836753	You are a Christmaka family.
5837414	5837674	Yes.
5838054	5838634	Which is fair.
5838714	5842915	So, we taught Julian about Hanukkah because he had to study for school.
5843455	5845676	He's a really good little gambler now with the dreidel.
5846196	5847216	And he loves guilt.
5847616	5848057	Who doesn't?
5848497	5849297	And he was going around going...
5853223	5868109	and Becky and I determined that there's not a we call it the phlegm sound because there's no real translation for phlegm sound from Hebrew to English other than Chanukah
5868909	5870471	Well, whatever it is you celebrate.
5870751	5872412	And Kwanzaa's the 26th.
5872532	5876256	Kwanzaa, Festivus, if you have a Festivus pull-up, enjoy it.
5876276	5876436	Yule.
5876456	5878097	Yule, whatever it is.
5878137	5879238	Dance naked around the tree.
5879939	5880339	Enjoy.
5880359	5885544	And just a big thank you from all of us to you guys who are such a great support for the show.
5885584	5886745	We've had a really good year this year.
5887825	5891648	and just additional exposure through Stitcher and podcasts.
5892468	5898832	I know personally I've met a lot of other great podcasts through GamerX was a great way to connect with a lot of other podcasters.
5898852	5899513	That was great.
5900533	5901474	And just so on.
5901534	5902554	So I just want to say thanks.
5902674	5903835	We've had a great year.
5903975	5905876	VOG has continued to grow, which has been great.
5906737	5908918	Brought on one or two new shows this year.
5908958	5909438	I can't remember...
5910419	5911520	I know Electric Sisterhood was this year.
5911540	5913741	I can't remember if there was one other one this year, if that was last year.
5913781	5916883	But anyway, that hopefully continuing to grow into next year.
5916943	5919485	And just, yeah, lots of great things happening.
5919905	5920886	And you guys are all to thank for that.
5921246	5922787	Next year looks to be awesome as well.
5923188	5925309	Cannot wait for DragonCon 2014.
5925929	5929492	Bobby and Travis Donovan done gone and got me addicted to DragonCon.
5929952	5930953	So I'm counting down the days.
5930973	5932494	So I go back to Atlanta for 2014.
5932574	5933895	It's going to be very exciting.
5934175	5937377	GamerX2 going to be amazing.
5937537	5940059	Like, I don't even think I can handle how amazing that weekend's going to be.
5941400	5941820	and so on.
5941860	5942780	Whatever else I end up doing.
5942820	5946943	I'm really hoping to get that New York City trip in this year that I've been needing to take for the past six years.
5948164	5949224	I just want to go to GamerX.
5949364	5951626	There's a great OLR family in New York City.
5951646	5953047	I'm sure we can make GamerX happen for you.
5953707	5954147	It'll be easy.
5957189	5957769	So there we go.
5958850	5962432	We're going to get into some more gaming news, some rapid fire news.
5962512	5966795	I'm trying to buy Loki a little time because he's taking care of what he has to do for his wisdom teeth.
5966815	5967195	You all right?
5968413	5977187	Yeah, alright Gotta do your salt water rinse, yep Don't want to get an infection, that's fine, I understand Is shoving all those salted french fries in your mouth Isn't the same effect?
5977328	5982977	I really don't remember having to do that But I remember them giving me Two different mouthwashes
5983931	5984732	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6014600	6014761	and
6016837	6021120	To celebrate that, I'm not sure if they're releasing on any more platforms here anytime soon.
6022021	6025823	Oh, it is on its way to Vita, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4.
6025964	6027845	So, soon.
6028726	6029986	That'll be even more copies.
6031488	6032508	Elder Scrolls Online.
6032588	6035150	They finally announced the launch date of April 4th.
6035190	6037752	Man, that is going to be a busy month for MMOs.
6038252	6038713	Gotta say.
6040414	6042155	PC... Well, that's for PC and Mac.
6042816	6045838	Next-gen version not coming until June...
6046358	6051299	So if you're hoping to get on the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, you're going to be waiting a little bit longer.
6052900	6072205	And last but not least, this is kind of surprising because I remember this game from a while ago when Atari released it, but Mark Echo's Getting Up, contents under pressure, the kind of weird graffiti slash futuristic...
6073565	6099098	um government totalitarian game um originally like I said put out by Atari and now though the rights have actually been um snatched up and um it's been released onto Steam so you can check it out um thanks to Devolver Digital for publishing that and that's available on Steam and I think it's actually at least it was on sale so um
6100876	6107946	Yes, it's still on sale for 50% off, so $7.49 if you want to check out the game if you may have missed it.
6109483	6113407	Alright, moving on in music gaming news that isn't so happy.
6113948	6118352	DJ Max Technica 2 and Technica 3 had this online thing called Platinum Crew.
6118973	6124318	Not to be confused with the Vita version of DJ Max Technica, which I know a lot of you have, but the arcade versions had the Platinum Crew.
6124759	6126300	Unfortunately, that is shutting down.
6126340	6128563	It will no longer be available as of December 1st.
6130965	6132387	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6145962	6146402	SADNESS TO DJ MAXX
6169481	6170342	All but dead now.
6170582	6171863	Yeah, pretty much, unfortunately.
6192157	6195539	It got pulled due to an intellectual property dispute.
6196019	6196879	And who closed it?
6197299	6198240	Capcom.
6198360	6200361	Submitted a request on November 19th.
6200801	6203843	Phantasm was trying to get a developer's license for the game.
6203903	6206564	It would have reimagined a lot of the Ghost and Goblin stuff.
6207344	6211886	If for whatever reason they did not get the rights, they were going to rename it King Arthur.
6212146	6213267	That's what they were just going to call it.
6213627	6222631	However, it got shut down because I guess Capcom didn't really... It was one of those things where it sounded like they were... Just getting the impression again.
6222951	6225872	They were going to do that after the fact, not before the fact.
6226252	6229454	And Capcom didn't want the name of the game being used like that.
6229534	6231634	So I can kind of see that.
6232295	6241859	In happier news, our track record for helping out Kickstarters improves this week as read-only memories did get funded.
6241899	6242339	Woo!
6242959	6245181	I got to admit, they were really close.
6246281	6248283	It was really down to the wire, but they did make it.
6248323	6257188	So congratulations to Matt Kahn, who was on the show a couple weeks ago, as well as everybody over at MidBossGames that helps them out because they did reach beyond their goal.
6257268	6265333	They hit a final tally, 64,378, and they were trying to make 62,000 to get matched by Ouya.
6265373	6267615	But the good news is now they will be matched by Ouya.
6268075	6270177	So, yeah, that game is happening.
6270257	6273840	So, we're hoping that will be playable at GamerX, too.
6274260	6277303	So, congrats to those guys over there at MidBoss Games.
6277904	6278184	Woot.
6279125	6279745	Totally cool.
6279785	6280446	Look forward to playing.
6281667	6282027	Wow.
6282928	6285070	Did you see the screen capture that Bob Coffee just put in chat?
6285710	6286171	I did not.
6286331	6287592	Oh, yours don't load, do they?
6287912	6288893	Yeah, what am I looking at here?
6289934	6291475	Hi, I'm Wayne Brady from Nintendo.
6291515	6292236	Wayne Brady.
6292356	6293056	That's awesome.
6294355	6294855	That's funny.
6295075	6295615	Okay.
6295715	6297116	Is that a gold shirt wearing you?
6297136	6297496	Yes, it is.
6297716	6298116	Wow.
6298236	6298476	Okay.
6298516	6300037	Well, it's a gold letterbox.
6300297	6300397	Oh.
6300817	6306378	So, well, there is a Fable anniversary set coming out on February 4th, 2014.
6306438	6311140	That's the 1080p HD version of the original Fable.
6311640	6313060	So, actually, it will be a good game.
6313701	6316241	And it will also have launch day weapons and outfits pack.
6316481	6321643	And you get a loot weapon that is supposed to be pretty awesome.
6322683	6324345	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6342143	6350028	The core version is the 25th anniversary with nine figures, four of Witcher Mega Man, four Robot Masters, and one Dr. Wily.
6350908	6353410	And that's a $70 packet.
6353510	6365677	And then for $140 you get a deluxe version that adds Time Man and Oil Man and 40 card player decks and individual Robot Master game boards and dozens of token pieces.
6366277	6366977	So good for them.
6368338	6374784	and another cool thing and this is actually thanks to my hubby who gave me this bit of news while I was trying to work last night.
6376025	6386573	Ultra Street Fighter 4 is going to have online training and 3 vs 3 matches like King of Fighters so you can get your Street Fighter 4 on KOF style.
6387414	6397062	I am just looking forward to doing my final fight team of Andorre or Hugo, sorry Poison and
6398022	6399303	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6418857	6421359	I remember when they released Final Fight Guy on the NES.
6421399	6422639	It was such a big-ass deal.
6422759	6423700	And you know what I have?
6424080	6425381	Final Fight Guy in the box.
6425481	6427442	Although, in retro... I'm sorry, not on NES.
6427482	6428783	Super NES was Final Fight Guy.
6428863	6430444	It was a Blockbuster exclusive.
6430984	6434507	And, um... What's that other... God, fuck.
6434587	6437528	Mighty Final Fight was the... Mighty Final Fight was the Nintendo one.
6437548	6438529	And it was kind of shit.
6438549	6440150	It was kind of shit, you guys.
6440190	6440730	It was.
6440870	6442912	It's one of those things everybody's like, yeah, Mighty Final Fight.
6442932	6443912	And then when they play it, they're like, wow.
6443932	6444693	But it was fun.
6444813	6446054	It was fun for being shit.
6446314	6446474	Yeah.
6447034	6456897	But I mean, I'd have to say that Final Fight Guy was always my... I had a copy of it that I had borrowed from someone who stole it from Blockbuster.
6458658	6459698	Hey, I was in Alabama.
6459718	6460218	We're poor.
6460298	6460858	Classy.
6461398	6461719	Fuck.
6462179	6467540	And then I gave it back and I moved out here with my friend's Chrono Trigger that he just let me keep.
6468161	6473462	And Dan and I looked into Final Fight Guy loose and then we looked into the box separately.
6474602	6476003	So now we have Final Fight Guy in the box.
6477303	6483044	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, let's just cut to the chase and do a Capcom versus SNK 3 already.
6483064	6483784	Fuck yes.
6483984	6484424	Amen.
6484984	6485645	Hands in the air.
6486005	6486685	Testify.
6487425	6487925	Preach it.
6488185	6488605	Preach.
6489325	6489825	Preach.
6490125	6490806	Did I tell you?
6490826	6491446	This needs to happen.
6491466	6495486	By the way, one of the other games that we bought last night was Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
6495866	6496507	Oh, I'm sorry.
6497007	6499747	Well, we had to buy one, get one, and we couldn't find another freebie game.
6499827	6500007	All right.
6500027	6501107	Well, if you had nothing better to do.
6501127	6502468	We also got Metal Gear Rising.
6502748	6503028	Okay.
6503148	6504388	So we could play around as pretty boy.
6506758	6507420	Alright, is that it?
6507681	6507941	Yeah.
6508002	6510909	Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6517464	6522727	Every week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities, we ask a question and you guys answer it.
6522928	6524188	And you know what?
6524268	6530832	Because it is the holiday season and I'm feeling awfully charitable, I think I'm going to read all the answers tonight, of which there are an awful lot of them.
6530933	6531653	Yay, Rob.
6531793	6532534	So heads up, guys.
6532554	6533274	You can do it.
6533894	6534475	I can do it.
6534515	6534975	Cheerleader.
6535115	6535776	All right, here we go.
6535916	6536456	There's only what?
6536476	6537617	How many answers are on Facebook?
6538197	6537617	17.
6538237	6538837	We can do this.
6539018	6539398	All right.
6540950	6542391	Here's the Fugu question of the week.
6542691	6546915	And, oh God, this was a moment in history on the internet.
6546935	6551419	The internet just exploded and the gifts were priceless.
6552180	6562188	Because I'm sure you've all heard by now the bombshell that was dropped on the music industry when Beyonce just released a new album with no promotion or fanfare.
6562248	6565351	And the whole internet went to the Church of Beezus Christ.
6565811	6567671	and was like, Breach, honey.
6568192	6569752	And on top of that, it's good.
6569972	6571532	It is a great album.
6572092	6584175	And it's just like, I think my favorite thing that came out of the whole thing is that gif where she just, like Beyonce goes to the table and she just swipes all the albums of like Katy Perry and Gaga and Miley and everything just right off the table.
6584675	6587616	Although I will say this quickly, tangent, sorry, apologies, but...
6588716	6589537	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6611636	6612596	Yes, exactly.
6614797	6615477	You're so awful.
6615777	6616377	But you know what?
6616658	6618698	VH1 had that whole Divas thing for a while, remember?
6618738	6618998	Yes.
6619598	6620239	See, that was cool.
6620299	6623960	Remember when they would all come together at the end and sing like an Aretha song?
6623980	6629802	And they brought out Carole King at the end, and everyone tried to out-Diva Carole King, and you don't out-Diva Carole King.
6629922	6630582	I'm sorry.
6630722	6631902	On her song.
6632102	6633223	Although I understand.
6633483	6635903	Like, Beyonce just fucking out-Diva'd them all.
6635983	6638124	She just walked into the room, dropped the mic, and left.
6638164	6640025	Like, I get it, but, you know.
6640045	6640805	Because she's bejesus.
6641525	6644627	I think we should support all talented artists.
6644967	6647449	And I also just like that her album is called Beyonce.
6648850	6649150	Anyhow.
6650371	6653573	So all that aside, Shane is blowing up in chat.
6653673	6654853	I'm so sick of her.
6654953	6656174	So, so sick.
6657215	6658576	It's a fucking huge album.
6658616	6663058	I went back to check how many... What she did though, what she did was unprecedented.
6663379	6664019	400,000 copies sold.
6664059	6667101	That's like Gaga and Britney combined.
6667648	6672810	There's like, not just all the music, but she's got videos out for half the stuff on the album.
6672890	6673210	All of them.
6673610	6676031	Yeah, and that's on... And they're good videos.
6676111	6676811	Anyway, alright, look.
6676831	6677431	Okay, so anyway.
6677511	6678152	Moving on, sorry.
6678532	6679072	But here's the thing.
6679412	6681613	You're like, what the fuck does this have to do with gaming, Rob?
6681633	6683574	Didn't Beyonce sue a video game company?
6683794	6685274	Yeah, I was just like, huh?
6685594	6687135	Yes, she did, but here's the point.
6687995	6690638	The gaming community is, this is no stranger to us.
6690778	6692179	Like, we see this all the time, right?
6692199	6695703	They come out in E3 and say, hey, if you want to get this today, you can.
6696363	6696683	Like, what?
6697264	6698325	What are you?
6698345	6700127	We need to stop all this woman-on-woman fighting.
6700167	6701268	We need woman-on-man fighting.
6701308	6703210	I'm going to see Beyonce take out Nickelback for good.
6704271	6707354	I think everybody wants to see Beyonce take out Nickelback for good.
6709313	6737885	I would like to see it like freaking I don't know Celine Dion can take out Nickelback for good for all I care alright anyway so the gaming industry is no surprise this we see these it's out today announcements a lot what if you could in the gaming community have one I said realistic stealth announcement because I didn't want people to be like hologram gaming out today like okay if you could get a realistic stealth announcement this holiday season what bombshell do you want to see drop this holiday season so here we go
6738525	6767414	um coming up first from Jimmy B who I think honestly he got five likes on this post so I think he kind of has the winning answer here but Jimmy B over on Facebook says Half-Life 3 pops up on Steam on Christmas morning internet explodes we're praying everybody prayer circle let's all form one Half-Life 3 that would be the bombshell I'd like that would melt steam that would melt the internet are you kidding
6768167	6790020	Which is ironic, steam melting Alright, Jeremy J, our buddy from Koopa Club Hey Jeremy J, says I'd love to see Game Boy Advance games appear on the Wii U, eShop, OS, all stealth-like Specifically Metroid Zero Mission But yeah, that's a good realistic prediction Nintendo making more money off of old games, absolutely
6790700	6797988	Degenerate Johnny says, I want Rockstar to announce that Grand Theft Auto 5 is out now for the Wii U. It's current gen, so making a port shouldn't be a problem.
6798028	6804775	Plus, you can use the touchpad screen to help navigate throughout the city as well as play around with the iFruit app while playing GTA 5.
6804955	6806656	Sorry, Loki, but I had to speak my mind.
6807117	6808258	Why did he have to apologize?
6809439	6811922	Would you be offended by Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Wii U, Loki?
6812640	6812860	No.
6813120	6813380	All right.
6813400	6814621	That would be kind of awesome, actually.
6814901	6815301	He's right.
6815341	6817142	The whole integration with the app would be pretty cool.
6817283	6820344	For the record, back to the Beyonce versus Nickelback thing.
6821104	6824086	While I think Beyonce could take Nickelback, I think Rush could take Beyonce.
6826047	6827968	All they have to do is have Neil Peart drum on her head.
6830269	6831330	Anyhow, moving on.
6832130	6839116	Our buddy from PodCulture, Brad, says, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 emulation on the new consoles.
6839956	6841337	Don't think that's going to happen, buddy.
6841397	6841778	Sorry.
6842939	6847882	Well, the PlayStation 3 would be a lot closer because of the Gaikai technology.
6848063	6848903	That's possible.
6849043	6850404	Xbox 360, I don't know.
6850464	6854528	I mean, Microsoft will do it maybe if they can, but we'll see.
6854888	6857070	Fabrice A replies and says, Easy.
6857370	6858991	Sega launches a new console.
6859832	6861033	Why not stick to the classics?
6862885	6891156	Robert K said the rumored to be finished Shenmue HD is released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in time for the in-game Christmas festivities because sailors and I need hope Robert K taking a game of lucky hit on his his gander there so good luck Codeman says I would like Nintendo to announce a new Mario Galaxy I literally went crazy when I played the game for the first time I think a lot of people would like to see a new Mario Galaxy
6892436	6894840	FifthDream says, is Fallout 4 realistic enough?
6895100	6895721	Final Fantasy 15?
6896642	6897223	Probably not.
6897484	6903112	But it would be cool if Sony suddenly updated the PlayStation 4 with CD, MP3, and streaming media support.
6903172	6903973	A firmware update.
6904013	6905074	That could definitely happen.
6906403	6910664	Elliot B says, I could ask for a new Metroid Prime or Guitar Room Man, but I'll go with something a little more realistic.
6911004	6912884	Heists in GTA 5 Online.
6913284	6916885	Launching the online mode without a decent selection of co-op missions was very silly.
6917305	6919406	Even the fighter jet death matches are getting stale.
6919506	6921086	Rockstar, throw us a bone already.
6921566	6922306	You agree with Elliot?
6922747	6923027	Loki?
6923287	6924047	You want to see some heists?
6924687	6927808	Heists would be fun, but I don't think it's necessarily getting stale.
6927848	6934189	But now that they have all these content creator things, it'd be cool to do your own missions or make custom game types and stuff.
6935380	6956309	Sial responds and says Capcom releases a new good Mega Man or a new 2D Metroid from Nintendo Daniel T says the announcement of virtual console cross buy followed by a one more thing announcing the availability of as Jeremy said select Game Boy Advance titles or in my dreams DS and GameCube titles would make me fanboy so hard
6957997	6968284	John from Critical Myth, our pals over there, Mondays 4 o'clock Pacific on VOG, says Final Fantasy XI free to play on PS Vita 24th December 2013.
6968324	6970466	I think Loki would like that very much as well.
6971506	6976590	BloodDrunk replies and says Steam Holiday Sale Day 1 Half-Life 3 status available now.
6977130	6979571	I feel like that response should have been read to like, duh, duh, duh.
6993892	6995935	or in the Howard Cosell voice.
6996235	6998598	Yes, but don't expect me to do that when I'm sick.
6999879	7001682	You all know my impressions are not very good.
7003424	7007569	Jennifer L says, I would love the next generation of Pokemon to come out all stealthily.
7007849	7009251	Kids around the world would panic.
7010931	7028299	I don't think Pokemon games are capable of coming out without hype But that would be really funny to see happen Ragenator says As totally unrealistic as it may be I'd say that for the Steam Winter Sale Everything is completely and utterly free For a certain period within the sale It's a pipe dream, yeah, but one can dream, right?
7029359	7030501	Thanks for watching!
7044156	7050820	And lastly on Facebook, our pal Delvin from Video Game Realness, which is a really fun podcast out of Canada.
7051741	7058144	Delvin replies and says, Some kind of major Wii U release that none of us saw coming.
7058585	7060186	Not Star Fox or Metroid-like.
7060226	7061826	Something no one is expecting.
7062767	7064068	Spanish Inquisition the game.
7065269	7070432	Then we might have a bit more restored faith in Wii U and say they knew what they were doing all along.
7071352	7077837	Sadly, I think Wii U needs the fanfare to kind of get their investors rallied up a little more, but I'm going to hope.
7077977	7082420	I'm going to form a prayer circle with you because I would love to see that happen on Wii U as well.
7082680	7084261	And shut them haters down.
7084582	7085602	Shut them haters down.
7086643	7088064	All right, a few comments from Google+.
7088144	7091006	Redertainment says, price drop on everything.
7091286	7097771	Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, PS3, 360, games, accessories, everything reduced in price.
7098011	7099092	Also, I'd like a pony.
7101139	7106585	I was trying to reply to something Ranma said about PC will never become the master race for gaming.
7107506	7109068	All games will be nerfed to console standards.
7109328	7109949	Not quite so.
7110089	7112031	Because there's some people that refuse to leave Mac.
7112371	7112912	Don't forget that.
7113913	7120400	Anyhow, as far as Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and all that goes, 2014, it'll be a belated Christmas gift for Entertainment Belated.
7121401	7149717	uh Actdeft says a secret Nintendo Direct this week before we sign off we would like to gladly announce that we're releasing F-Zero Universe a new installment on the beloved F-Zero franchise with HD graphics online play in a new customization mode so you can change your machine however you like when's it going to be released you asked right after this Nintendo Direct is over on the Wii U eShop and a retail version in January how's that for a bombshell announcement well I came

7153778	7154238	Rob.
7156299	7156759	Rob.
7157659	7160140	I came over to the computer to place my pre-order.
7160180	7160780	That's what I meant.
7161720	7162420	Nothing dirty.
7162460	7162720	All right.
7162740	7164821	You don't have to call your mom.
7165081	7166261	Sam H. Please don't.
7166561	7169582	Sam H. says Uncharted 4 available today.
7170582	7172483	Colin M. says Shenmue 3.
7173243	7175004	Chalk another Shenmue answer up there.
7175384	7185029	And lastly but not leastly, Tech2030 replies and says, A new all-hand-drawn 2D Metroid game for Wii U or 3DS would make me the most excited.
7185409	7185989	There you go.
7186709	7187470	Love those answers.
7187510	7189691	Thank you guys over on Google Plus and Facebook.
7190011	7191012	Our Fugo Question of the Week.
7191072	7191912	I did read them all.
7192012	7193013	I was in the holiday spirit.
7193033	7193913	I wanted to read them all.
7194233	7196334	I like hearing people's fanboy dreams.
7196374	7197134	What about you guys?
7197215	7200176	Anything you would love to see the stealth announcement comes out?
7203352	7203812	I don't know.
7203913	7204713	I was replying to chat room.
7204854	7205394	That's alright.
7207537	7207897	I don't know.
7208558	7212883	I mean, really, right now, I don't know.
7213023	7213664	I really don't know.
7213764	7216747	I guess I would go with the Half-Life thing.
7217508	7219631	Because that would be pretty awesome.
7220332	7220752	Half-Life!
7220912	7221313	Okay, we're done.
7221333	7221473	Bye.
7222867	7249450	the one thing I want more than anything dear Jesus for your birthday I would really like more than anything to see after all these years and all this hoping and all this praying dear Beyonce may I please have the Guardian Legend on virtual console can I get an amen or a true sequel
7251203	7252404	I will take what I can get.
7252924	7255566	We need a Guardian Legend variety game.
7255746	7258529	Compile needs to rise from their grave.
7258609	7260170	Rise from your grave!
7260270	7262132	And not do any more Puyo Pop.
7263253	7266275	We need more Guardian Legend and more Compile shooters.
7268337	7269998	Alright, and Loki?
7270018	7274042	I don't know, I'd go for a new DDR.
7275356	7276337	You're just keeping it simple.
7276357	7277499	I just wanted a new TDR.
7277619	7278761	I mean, that would be shocking.
7278781	7281225	Hey, we're going to do a new TDR.
7281345	7281725	Really?
7281986	7282266	What?
7282366	7283768	It's only shocking if it's good.
7284049	7289397	I would like for our Roosevelt Golf Land to magically have a 2DX machine again and not get rid of it.
7289978	7292681	By the way, Scandia is going to get a 2DX machine, probably.
7292861	7293041	What?
7294122	7297325	Well, you may remember the guy that runs Seanigan.
7297445	7299767	You know, Seanigan, he has this wonderful arcade.
7299787	7300588	In his garage?
7300728	7301228	In his garage.
7301248	7302689	Well, it's also at the drive-in, too.
7303350	7305432	No, I ran into, he works at Scandia.
7305888	7312213	Yeah, he's picking three of his machines to bring in there, one of which is a 2DX20, I guess, or whatever.
7312713	7319899	We actually randomly met while I was playing some game over there, one of the shooting games, and we just started talking about his machines.
7319959	7321920	I would love to get that guy on this show if he's here locally.
7321940	7323101	He's on my Facebook.
7323261	7323802	Yeah, get him.
7323862	7324643	Send him a message.
7324663	7325163	Get him on the show.
7327164	7327445	All right.
7328125	7331167	Okay, Shane is sending me a private message in chat because apparently I skipped his answer.
7331207	7333268	But it's because you answered late, you jerk.
7333749	7350019	But our buddy Shane from Horde House says, I want a stealth announcement for F-Zero for Wii U and 3DS in the same style as the ACGX versions, and then unlockable GX versions in both the Wii U and 3DS, and Jack Levin's theme making a comeback because it was the best in GX.
7350339	7352660	That's an awfully tall order, but I would love to see that.
7352761	7353001	Yeah.
7353701	7354441	I'm sorry, go ahead.
7354501	7355261	No, you first.
7355461	7360602	The current votes for machines that they are going to bring is top three machines will go to the location.
7360722	7369204	Top three so far, 2DX Linkle, upgraded to Tricoro, PoppyMusic20, upgraded to Sunny Park, and DGMAX Technica 3.
7370144	7371064	Woohoo!
7371884	7375245	Actually, Other is number three, but who knows how Other is.
7376145	7377525	I agree with all of these selections.
7378566	7380446	And I forgot what I was going to say, so it doesn't matter.
7380956	7383103	Well, then let's get back into some news, Loki.
7383966	7384327	Alright.
7386969	7389431	So the Xbox One, let's talk a little bit more about that.
7391192	7392974	I'm kind of surprised that they kind of went back.
7393234	7401221	Well, I guess it never really worked for retail games, but they're not requiring demos.
7402462	7406084	It's up to the devs to basically decide whether they're going to put out a demo for their game.
7406425	7412630	Now, originally, you had to have a demo for any Xbox Live Arcade game that was out there.
7413110	7418473	But now I guess they're kind of going the route of like the retail games where it doesn't necessarily have to have a demo.
7418713	7431319	I kind of think that's a little lame because games are expensive and sometimes the demos get you to buy the game or in some cases I guess get you not to buy the game if you can't beat the demo.
7434199	7437421	I don't know, it's interesting.
7438082	7460096	There is one, I guess one of the demos that they're actually putting out, and I really hate, I think Nintendo was the one that kind of started this, but those demos that have a certain number of playthroughs you can do on them before they lock you out of them completely, like Dead Rising 3, they're going to let you play it for 20 minutes, and then you can play it for two more times other than that, and then it's done.
7460116	7461237	Yeah.
7461677	7462458	That's interesting.
7462478	7463418	It's like, what the hell, man?
7464259	7466440	It's not that different from what PlayStation Plus has you do.
7466500	7468301	You can play the first hour, but still.
7468562	7479608	Yeah, but I remember back when they had the timed demos for Saints Row, and I played that demo over and over and over again, and it just got me hyped about the game, and I bought it immediately when it came out.
7480009	7484071	But that's how I killed my time until it came out, was by playing that demo over and over and over again.
7485352	7486192	I guess just...
7487293	7506794	um whatever do you have to download the whole stinking thing just to play 20 minutes or does it do like the streaming thing i think it's the i think it's probably a shorter demo it's that's good but it's apparently the map i mean but it's just 20 minutes of it so maybe we have to download the whole thing i don't know um and they've also hit the 2 million sales mark as of um
7508912	7511093	as of the 11th.
7511653	7513454	So, hooray.
7515055	7515375	Oh, sorry.
7515415	7515635	Go ahead.
7516055	7517576	So, everybody's doing well.
7517736	7518616	Selling lots of consoles.
7519016	7522378	Everybody's spinning it like they're winning, but at the end of the day, they're both doing well.
7522838	7524859	Sony and Microsoft, anyway.
7525179	7525699	Here's the only thing.
7527040	7531902	Not that I'm worried about any of these companies, but I'm seeing a pattern emerge here, and...
7532822	7534844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7553340	7579735	so it gets me worried that maybe they aren't flying off shelves not to say that they're doing bad I mean they sold 2 million units worldwide so that's not bad but it may be slowing down a lot faster and I think a lot of that has to do probably with the launch lineup there's just not a lot to drive people to buy them so that's my concern I guess it would go with Playstation 2 because maybe they're just not producing a ton of units I think they're about neck and neck as far as sales go
7579975	7586058	It should be said as well, even though maybe Nintendo's not having the best luck with Wii U, and it doesn't seem like their fortune's turning around.
7586098	7590461	I mean, they're selling more of them, but it's not in the same league as these other consoles right now.
7591061	7593422	3DS still continues to sell like wildfires.
7593482	7596764	I mean, that's a huge success story for Nintendo, so at least there's that.
7597144	7598345	So they won't be going out of business.
7599946	7600226	All right.
7600886	7603468	Anyhow, speaking of sales, let's go over to the MPD numbers.
7603508	7607511	And Loki, you might have to help me out here a little bit because you read into more of the stuff than I do.
7607871	7609472	But video game sales for the U.S.
7609512	7615056	in November up 7% from last year, which you would hope is going to happen when you have new consoles out.
7615456	7618979	Hardware jumped up 58% again with two new consoles out.
7619019	7620260	You would hope those numbers go up.
7621060	7627262	PlayStation 4, the top-selling console in November, and PlayStation was number one in sales overall for home consoles.
7628202	7632463	My fans will be quick to tell you that, well, they had an additional week to sell those consoles.
7632903	7633423	Whatever.
7633583	7636444	Again, they're both doing very well.
7638125	7640225	909,132 Xbox One units sold in the U.S.
7640265	7642986	in the first nine days, meaning over 100,000 a day.
7644606	7645967	The top-selling games.
7646027	7646627	Here's the top 10.
7648737	7649697	1.
7648797	7649697	Call of Duty Ghosts 2.
7650738	7651598	Battlefield 4 3.
7652178	7652918	Assassin's Creed 4 4.
7654278	7655239	Madden 25 5.
7655879	7656799	Grand Theft Auto 5 6.
7657819	7659319	NBA 2K14 7.
7660380	7662340	Skylanders Swap Force 8.
7662400	7663680	Just Dance 2014 9.
7664461	7665241	Disney Infinity 10.
7666361	7668722	FIFA 14 No surprise at all.
7668762	7674723	You've got your typical big sellers, the Call of Duty and the Battlefield, your Assassin's Creed, the Sports Balls,
7675563	7681327	Grand Theft Auto is still in there and then the kiddie toy games with Skylanders and Disney Affinity rounding out your top 10.
7681768	7683229	Not a lot of surprises in there, right?
7683909	7684049	No.
7684830	7688913	Let's talk about some of those Nintendo numbers because we do have some numbers about Nintendo.
7688933	7692215	770,000 Nintendo 3DSs sold in November.
7692395	7692616	Wow.
7696258	7702121	So the 3DS has been out for a couple years, and they sold almost as many of those as they did Xbox Ones.
7702542	7703242	That's pretty good.
7705063	7717650	Also, Wii U hardware sales, they say up by 340%, but I think we all know that's kind of a spin because three times a little number is still not probably going to be a huge number.
7718090	7746487	but it is what it is but Super Mario 3D World 215,000 digital and physical units in the first 8 days not too shabby especially in light of the article from Japan that didn't have quite the impressive number last week but it should be noted that didn't allow it to crack the top 10 but considering that Super Mario 3D World is on one console and one console that hasn't really cracked through as well as every single one of those games in the top 10 that I read off multiple formats
7747000	7753342	Yeah, I would assume I'm looking right here to set some of the weekly charts for hardware.
7753823	7756204	Trying to see if I can pull up older stuff.
7756524	7757704	Oh, that's not helping.
7758424	7764507	Anyways, for hardware though, like for example, the week of the 7th, that would have been a week ago.
7765907	7773169	Wii U moved 72,000 units in North America and the 3DS 244,000.
7773329	7780551	So kind of give you an idea, you know, when they're saying 700,000, you're probably looking at maybe 150,000 units of Wii U, which is not bad.
7783792	7784132	Bad.
7784192	7785813	I mean, it's good.
7786153	7791757	Again, it's one of those things where it's like, it's not going to bankrupt the company, but it's going to be very interesting to see what they do in 2014.
7792537	7794378	Like, is Nintendo going to stick with it?
7794618	7800422	And I kind of think they're stubborn enough and they believe in it enough that I think they're going to stick with it.
7801102	7810145	I'm not sure what they're going to do to sell more, but I think they believe enough in Bayonetta and Smash Brothers and whatever Zelda or Mario game they have hidden up their sleeve for holiday 2014.
7811305	7813226	Mario Kart next year is going to be huge.
7813546	7815527	I think they believe enough in those that they're going to still try.
7817699	7827306	I hope it turns it around for them, because if Mario Kart or Smash Brothers can't move units, then they're going to be in trouble.
7827326	7830688	There are some people saying that Nintendo will announce a new console at this E3.
7831469	7831629	No.
7832470	7833310	That's way too soon.
7833550	7835552	Internally, are they having that dialogue?
7835652	7836192	Probably.
7837573	7838394	But I don't know.
7838494	7841456	It's going to be very interesting to see what happens at E3 this year for Nintendo.
7842668	7847491	They seem to be pushing themselves into that outside of the regular release stuff, you know?
7848331	7848591	Yeah.
7848671	7852874	Well, it's just disappointing not seeing the third-party support just not there.
7852894	7854855	I mean, they're going to be showing stuff on screen.
7855455	7860838	They're always going to say that they have the third-party support, but they don't have full third-party support, and that's what's really hurting them.
7860858	7861519	Well, 3DS does.
7862879	7863940	Not necessarily.
7864440	7866641	There's no EA 3DS games anymore.
7866781	7867182	Oh, wow.
7867322	7867542	Okay.
7868174	7869535	Yeah, they've completely cut them off.
7869555	7872999	But still, they have plenty of stuff on 3DS keeping it going, you know?
7874280	7875861	There's plenty of stuff on 3DS.
7876482	7880366	That's when they speak about Nintendo partners and not just 3DS and Wii U separately, you know what I mean?
7880566	7885651	Yeah, because EA's not supporting them on any of the platforms right now.
7886285	7890066	Zebediah the Messiah in our chatroom says Mario Kart Wii U bundle and I'm in.
7891627	7893548	I think that's a guaranteed from Nintendo.
7893648	7896449	If not, you know Costco and Best Buy and all that.
7896469	7897529	They're going to have their bundles.
7897709	7898229	Absolutely.
7899110	7905932	YYR says Smash Brothers usually sells consoles, but I think the biggest threat to Smash selling Wii U consoles is Smash for 3DS.
7907272	7914615	Well, the other thing too is a lot of people already bought the Wii U for Smash Brothers, so you can't really count a lot of new sales from that.
7914635	7914695	Who
7914815	7917482	Who buys a console for a game two years out from now?
7919728	7920009	Really?
7920751	7921733	We kind of considered.
7922375	7923478	You considered, but you didn't?
7923578	7923718	No.
7925316	7954069	so you know anyway I would say if you're gonna get a Wii U get a fucking Wii U because the Mario 3D World is one of the best games you're gonna play this year period especially if you have people in your house to play games with or people over frequently you will not find a better party multiplayer game experience than you will with Mario 3D World that's what you're missing but you know again do you want to pay three what would that be about $300 system plus game just wait the price will come down do you want to pay $300 to be the coolest kid on the block
7956932	7958613	Anyhow, let's move on.
7958693	7959473	More news.
7959593	7960113	DarkSakura.
7960874	7963215	Well, I do have another bit of news.
7963315	7968697	And this actually came to me by means of one of my friends who I met through Tumblr.
7969757	7971858	And I have to give you the story of how I met her later.
7972398	7973539	But it was very interesting.
7973719	7974619	Trading porn pics?
7974939	7975119	No.
7975240	7975420	Okay.
7977641	7978302	I love Tumblr.
7978602	7979443	I'm just here for the gifts.
7979524	7984729	I was at the Russian market and saw one of their free publications with someone's Homestuck fan art on it on the cover.
7985230	7987993	And the article that it was advertising had nothing to do with Homestuck.
7988533	7992298	So I found out who did it, messaged her, and mailed her the magazine in Australia.
7993479	7994260	Wow, that's something.
7995036	7997819	We've been chatting off and on back.
7998139	7998940	She's a really good artist.
7998960	8000742	She's done a thank you pic for me.
8000762	8002163	She's a really, really good artist.
8002664	8017078	But she linked me this story about how the South Australian government is doing an anti-gaming campaign that has a little girl with shades on at a poker table looking at her iPad saying, gambling starts with games.
8019040	8041293	and basically what they're trying to do is I think it has more to do with the Facebook style and casual games, the online poker and the microtransaction type games but they have a site that's called nogame.sa.gov.au which I hate giving it anything but go look at it and laugh.
8042574	8064794	so basically it's supposed to say it's wanting to add an MA 15 plus to any game that includes simulated gambling meaning slot machines a card mechanics even what was the last Pokemon games Diamond and Pearl had like a slot machine thing in them didn't they I don't remember
8065248	8071652	or, you know, any game that has some kind of variety of anything that could be, you know, construed as gambling.
8072113	8076696	So they're trying to get this bit of a... Is Pachinko considered gambling?
8076836	8078777	Because Nintendo Land has the Pachinko in it.
8079077	8079938	It's totally gambling.
8080018	8082379	Well, I mean, Pachinko technically is gambling.
8082559	8085381	It's just... Final Fantasy X-2 has, like, Casino Land.
8085401	8086382	Yeah.
8086840	8093826	Well, I mean, look at Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Casino Night Zone Which was like the best zone in the whole game I know, right?
8094767	8099752	MM2K in chat at live.vognetwork.com says Australian government hates games It sure seems that way
8100256	8119775	Well, Ron Curry, who is the CEO of Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, has gone out saying that the view is supported by the fact that there was no consultation with an industry lead in the lead up to this policy announcement and the subsequent awareness campaign, meaning that they haven't even reached out to work with the companies.
8119895	8122157	They're just going on a broad generalization.
8123398	8128620	And, you know, the way that this was linked to me is, have you seen this fuckery?
8129100	8133701	I mean, that's not exactly what, you know, how she said it, but it was pretty much the same thing.
8134001	8143024	And she was going on to explain how there's a lot of revenue in South Australia comes from slot machines.
8143204	8149466	There's a big problem with gambling because, and I believe they're called pokies there.
8149806	8151147	But we're blaming games for that?
8151667	8161534	I just, out of curiosity, I wanted to know, because you know, right here in the States right now, everybody's talking about mega millions, because the lottery is up to like $500 million, and even I'm buying a lotto ticket, that says something.
8161574	8164296	I usually don't pay the idiot tax, as my mom calls it.
8164596	8166598	You gonna pay the idiot tax, Rob?
8167278	8169380	You know, when you buy the lottery tickets, you're an idiot.
8170180	8170561	But anyway.
8170721	8171902	Yeah, she wouldn't be saying that if you won.
8171922	8172482	Yeah, exactly.
8172522	8176245	When I win, and we see what home she gets put in, we'll see.
8176345	8177606	Let her retire in Boca.
8178466	8182290	Well, as she also says, it costs a dollar to dream these days, doesn't it, Rab?
8182730	8187094	Anyway, the reason why I bring that up is I was curious, does Australia have the lottery?
8187794	8189376	Because I don't know much about the culture there.
8189416	8190296	Does Australia have lottery?
8190356	8191778	Maybe some chatters can set me straight.
8191798	8197022	I don't know if we have any Aussies in chat tonight, but I'm looking at Wikipedia, which I always love to go to to look up information.
8197422	8200885	It looks like there's some different types of Australian lotteries, kind of depending about where you are.
8200945	8201145	There's
8201846	8206352	Tats has a lottery in Victoria, Tasmania, and the Australian Capital Territory in the Northern Territory.
8206692	8209756	And then there's some state-owned, including the South Australian lotteries.
8210056	8213000	So the reason why I bring that up is like, well, okay, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.
8214021	8221089	The government has a sanctioned lottery system, yet we're going to pinpoint video games as don't play games because it'll lead to gambling.
8221270	8221410	Like,
8223308	8224889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8243800	8244581	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8266094	8274284	and it's caused, you know, there have been political parties formed to, you know, to get rid of the legalized gambling.
8275265	8281172	And so if people are having such a big problem with it to the point that they're trying to censor games to...
8283200	8284281	to prevent that.
8284621	8293005	Why don't they just pass the legislation and get rid of the machines or else regulate them a lot harder than they are now.
8294066	8295146	Here's the other side of that.
8296227	8297688	They get a lot of money from those machines.
8298168	8300469	They get a lot of money from those machines.
8300549	8310134	It was like in Mississippi after Katrina because they didn't want the casinos on Mississippi soil so they were on barges.
8311395	8327169	and then right after Katrina hit and the casinos were like we're going to leave because we're not going to build them on barges for the next hurricane to knock us over Mississippi changed their laws really quickly so that they could keep that source of revenue and keep all those jobs in Biloxi
8328704	8339972	Um, yeah, it's, it's obviously if you know somebody that's addicted to gambling, you know, that's a real thing, but there's lots of, you can get addicted to anything, you know, you can get addicted to video games and that's dangerous too, you know, but I just don't.
8339992	8341133	It's excessive compulsive behavior.
8341173	8341473	Yeah.
8342514	8344275	So, you know, if you're gonna, I like gambling.
8344395	8345656	Did video games cause that?
8345716	8346377	I don't think so.
8346957	8362455	I hate gambling I also put a limit on my gambling like if I go to Reno or something I usually say okay $100 in fun money that's how much I would spend on a concert ticket to go see a AAA concert or you know a night out with drinks for Alan and I you know see
8363115	8365719	Your limit is about 10 times more than my limit.
8366440	8377216	Because the only times I have ever gone gambling with a purpose is when I had 50 cents and needed cab money and made myself $15.
8378274	8380535	YYR in chat says, Gambling video games might cause gambling.
8380555	8380715	Well, but...
8403310	8403730	I don't know.
8404331	8409552	It's just weird for me to say that, oh, because they played it in the game, they got addicted to gambling.
8409592	8415273	I mean, if they were wired for that anyway, wouldn't just playing gambling kind of get them into that?
8416634	8429817	It has to do with... I kind of have a problem with calling certain behaviors an addiction, except they do give that same sort of chemical response.
8431935	8436498	So in that case, you're creating your own drug by performing the action.
8437139	8445264	And so it comes, the only way to break that is to either remove the ability to do the action or remove the positive sensation that comes from the action.
8445884	8461655	But even with losing money, losing friends, suffering financial difficulties because of the reward, the behavior, it doesn't stop that feeling of pleasure that somebody gets from participating in it.
8462035	8463936	which is why you have people that are addicted to gambling.
8463976	8465517	You have people that are addicted to gaming.
8465958	8469760	You have people who are pathological house cleaners.
8469860	8474043	It's all the same kind of pleasure response that comes from continued action.
8474063	8474683	That's my mother.
8474883	8477345	My mother will follow you in the house with a vacuum cleaner.
8477645	8478086	She will.
8478306	8478746	No joke.
8479246	8480407	I have literally caught her doing this.
8480507	8489673	I had a cup of coffee and I sat it on her counter or whatever and I was talking and talking and then I picked it up and put the cup away in the sink and she came in right behind me and wiped down the counter.
8491633	8520187	but it's I'm trying to there's and for a lot of people you know I'm trying to get back to what I was trying to say with this too is that instead of treating the enabler being the gambling or the gateway as they're calling it the games that have the gambling element they need to treat the the behavior addiction
8522130	8527654	You shouldn't penalize a whole group for something that's a problem of a handful of people.
8528274	8532757	Well, if you or someone you know got addicted to gambling and video games are to blame for it, we'd love to hear from you.
8532838	8537601	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Meanwhile, back into the news, Loki.
8537921	8541103	That sounds like one of those advertisements for like Ricky Lake.
8541343	8547067	Call 1-877-GO-RICKY Did your drag queen dad beat you when you were a child?
8547648	8548949	If so, call us now.
8549622	8551042	That show is such a fucking train wreck.
8551623	8553443	I loved it.
8553663	8556264	She'd be like, oh my god, I'm not getting into this.
8556284	8557925	She'd just stand back and watch like, oh my god.
8557985	8563606	It was always that look of her hand pressed against her face and her jaw dropped like, I can't control what's going on.
8563826	8567007	Oh, Ricky, go back to doing Waters movies.
8567047	8570889	The legit best weave pulling of all time came from the Ricky Lake show too.
8570929	8571709	Just Google it.
8571749	8573009	Ricky Lake weave pulling.
8573209	8574470	It's fascinating.
8574510	8574710	Anyway.
8575450	8584821	SSJ100 Matt says Australian PSA, don't gamble or a dingo will eat your baby I'm sure the Australians that listen to this show greatly appreciate that SSJ100 Matt
8585569	8586489	So what do you expect?
8586569	8592951	When a game service doesn't exactly work like it's supposed to, what are you to do?
8593091	8597272	Of course, you should go on the internet and complain.
8597952	8602054	And then, of course, the lawyers come and decide, hey, let's make this into a class action lawsuit.
8602194	8608035	In which case, that's what's happening now with a law firm investigating EA and Battlefield 4.
8610196	8614257	Law firm Holzer Holzer and Holzer Holzer and Fistel.
8615197	8617399	I love that name, that's awesome.
8617559	8633588	LLC is investigating whether EA, I guess they claim that regarding the development and sales of Battlefield 4 and its impact on EA's revenue and projects moving forward, complied with federal security laws.
8633868	8635009	I don't even know what the hell that means.
8635149	8640993	All I know is people are bitching about Battlefield 4 and that I'm guessing that they're smelling money somewhere.
8641053	8641213	That
8641553	8650220	hmm that whole SimCity thing was really fucked up and people were really pissed by that hmm maybe we can get some of the money out of that EA's got money right?
8650800	8652282	EA's got a bit of money I think
8653319	8654660	because they charge us for everything.
8656021	8662925	I'm thinking, though, that this may not necessarily be... If the internet wins this class action lawsuit, we lose.
8662945	8663986	Well, here's the thing.
8664046	8666568	It's not necessarily for people that are playing the game.
8666628	8676134	It's for investors basically saying that they misled investors that they knew that Battlefield 4 was going to be a fucked up thing and that they knew that they were going to lose money and stuff.
8676254	8676774	Clever.
8676834	8679416	That's what it's all about.
8679896	8681678	But, yeah, seriously, it's...
8682558	8682819	Money.
8683220	8684785	They smell money, they're gonna go for the money.
8685648	8686691	It's like blood and sharks.
8687874	8688356	What are you gonna do?
8690519	8692259	Shark is delicious, but you can't eat people.
8694160	8697220	Alright, well, I know I would eat this game right up if it comes out.
8698581	8700621	Who doesn't love the Second Densetsu series?
8701201	8705162	And if you don't know it by that name, perhaps if I said Secret of Mana, remember that game?
8705182	8707062	That was a classic, classic Super Nintendo game.
8707082	8708983	Which is sad, because Legend of Mana was kind of crap.
8709063	8713164	Legend of Mana was pretty balls, but Second Densetsu 3, really good.
8713184	8714644	Hardcore awesome.
8715404	8722869	Secret of Evermore, Underrated, I realized it wasn't really part of the same series because it was Square America's game, but Underrated, I think.
8723269	8725751	Time was really mean to that game.
8727032	8731414	Anyway, the Of Mana series, I think a lot of us would love to play a new game in that again.
8731875	8743302	Well, there are hints that an unannounced title in the series could be brewing, and this is because of a Christmas album that featured a song from an as-of-yet-unreleased game.
8743962	8752025	The official page for Xmas Collections 2 includes a mention of Second Detsetsu, the series' Japanese name, labeled as Future Project.
8752745	8755306	Now, could this be Circle of Mana?
8755406	8760168	Circle of Mana was a Japanese release on iOS and Android devices, which I'm...
8760908	8763429	which is very strange that we don't have that here yet.
8763569	8767291	I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of time before that's translated and comes out over here.
8767731	8770013	Jamie instantly picked up her phone and started searching.
8770113	8771073	Only in Japan, Jamie.
8771593	8772094	Only in Japan.
8772834	8774135	You can look and bookmark it.
8774455	8776136	This is why you jailbreak your devices.
8777076	8777296	Right?
8777857	8782619	So, anyhow, I know I would love to see a new of Mana game.
8782679	8787761	I really hope that is something that's in the pipeline for oh, wouldn't that be an awesome PlayStation 4 game?
8789042	8789423	DarkSakura, Loki?
8798643	8799784	Do you think there could be any truth here?
8799804	8800985	Do you think it's just circle of mana?
8801145	8801986	I need new pants.
8804167	8804427	All right.
8805688	8807009	Let's move on to the mailbag.
8807230	8811413	DarkSakura, unfortunately, will have to put her phone down to find the game that she's not going to be able to find.
8812233	8814635	And we're going to go to the mailbag.
8818358	8818719	All right.
8818859	8823162	Every week, you guys email us mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
8823442	8827005	And DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag head first and find an email that she thinks, hey.
8828151	8828971	This one's twitching.
8829172	8835695	This one should be read on air because if I don't read it, we'll get another email next week chewing me out.
8836755	8837896	Only a couple emails this week, right?
8839296	8839977	Just one or two, right?
8841397	8841678	Three.
8842078	8842758	Oh, three, okay.
8842898	8843839	So let me get this straight.
8843859	8847721	You guys do a video game podcast, but you couldn't be bothered to actually watch a video game's award show.
8848121	8852563	However, you were able to do a little Monday morning quarterbacking and bash the show none of you watched.
8852643	8853984	Wow, I didn't bash anything.
8854844	8859027	I watched the live stream and it was better than the usual schtick you see in award shows.
8859087	8867794	Instead of making a big deal about the subjective superlatives of best this and that, the show is bringing gamers the previews of upcoming games, something all gamers are normally excited to see.
8868194	8869475	And bashing Joel is just mean.
8869635	8871456	He was hired to do a job and I thought he earned his pay.
8871496	8877341	Calling him transphobic was unfairly judgmental considering you didn't watch the show and everything you heard about it was taken out of context.
8878021	8880724	Hey guys, you do have a right to your opinion, but next time do your homework.
8881284	8882505	You do a video game podcast.
8882525	8885228	It seems a little odd and disappointing that not one of you took the time to watch the show.
8885288	8885788	Again, wow.
8885828	8886469	Sincerely, Narc.
8887470	8891594	I don't remember saying anything about the guy because I didn't watch it and I didn't have anything to say.
8892691	8897773	I didn't watch it, and I was recanting things that I read across the internet.
8897933	8903576	I know that people were offended at some of the things that Joel McHale said, whether you weren't or not, other people were.
8903596	8907377	Wow, I thought I was defending him, but that was me.
8907617	8918242	You know what, this guy's welcome to his opinion, but I kind of have a problem with the... He says, because you guys have a video game podcast, you should watch this show.
8918942	8919142	No.
8920483	8920723	Why?
8921494	8924676	If it's something I don't care about watching, I don't have to watch anything.
8925456	8930339	I listen to other independent podcasts that do their award shows, and I'm curious what they have to say.
8930439	8934962	People like you and me that do their own shows, and I read websites.
8935803	8940486	What makes this any more or less of a deal than those?
8941690	8943491	That was not proven to me in the email.
8943532	8946654	The only thing I heard in there was, oh, they have previews of new games.
8947234	8947535	Great.
8947815	8949897	I did look at all of those on YouTube after.
8950677	8954460	And if Joel was so great, why did they excise him completely from the TV version?
8956822	8958664	And I watched part of the show.
8958684	8968892	I can't watch the whole thing because I had things to do that day, but I did catch part of it and I commented on the part I saw as well as the recaps I saw on YouTube, which I know were cleverly edited together.
8969324	8974887	If I was going to be perfectly honest about it, I've been so busy with school and other stuff, I actually didn't even know it was on.
8975567	8983612	So, like I said, I have my feelings about what I've heard from that, but I don't care either way.
8984052	8987734	If you play a musical instrument, are you required to watch the Grammys?
8988134	8988434	No.
8988674	8991696	If you make home movies, are you required to watch the Oscars?
8991716	8991756	No.
8994299	8996441	I'm just kind of throwing it out there.
8997221	9005045	I'm challenging because obviously this guy puts VGX up on a pedestal, which is fine.
9005065	9005985	You're allowed to do that.
9006105	9009747	And maybe we were too harsh on things.
9009767	9015150	Well, I think his criticism is that we're criticizing the show, yet we didn't watch the entire show.
9015850	9019172	Oh my God, if I had to watch that entire show, I'd be tearing my hair out.
9019672	9020793	It was slow.
9021073	9023034	It was very slow paced.
9023734	9024894	I just don't want to do that.
9024954	9026635	I was trying to explain two things last week.
9026895	9032718	One, what I heard everybody else saying because, yeah, of course I'm going to say, oh, this is the feeling I was getting.
9033218	9041081	I read this person's blog that was very upset over the joke that Joel McHale said because this was a transgender person themselves that was very upset at the joke.
9041841	9045783	So, yeah, I was going to communicate that I heard some people were pretty pissed off at this joke.
9046503	9046823	And then...
9049945	9054729	I'm telling you why I don't watch it because I don't see the reason to.
9055369	9063195	And it's not like I can sit here on a video game show and just flat out say, which is the honest truth, that I didn't care about the fact that there was an award show.
9063575	9065516	I didn't care who won and I didn't care about watching it.
9066677	9067618	That doesn't make good radio.
9069370	9081089	I love video games You, the emailer, love video games The chatters that are here love video games DarkSakura and Loki love video games That is why we do a video game podcast End For the record, I really didn't care
9082102	9094885	No, and I don't want to sound combative or anything, although this email was pretty pointed, because everybody does have a right to their opinion, and I can get where you're kind of like, well, don't shut your yap if you're going to comment on something you didn't even watch.
9094985	9098086	But it's what's going on out there.
9098146	9099506	We have to comment on it somehow.
9099806	9105488	And this is a big human nature kind of thing, at least amongst the average neurotypical human being.
9105848	9109549	No one likes to hear when someone does not like something that they like.
9110069	9110769	A very good point.
9111317	9120605	however, it must be understood that sometimes you may like something and other people either will not like it or don't give a shit about it you have to live with that
9121664	9131133	You wrote that article on VOG this week all about Homestuck, which is something... Well, but to be fair, that's something plenty of people have judged without really looking at it themselves.
9131354	9132455	Would that be accurate to say?
9132555	9133196	I'd say so, yeah.
9133316	9139362	And that could be plenty because some of the cosplayers have been boneheads, and you touched on that in the article.
9140343	9144427	And so, you know, sometimes it's people giving it a bad image and so forth, so...
9144947	9157312	When I was looking for graphics, because I wanted a good background to do the banner from, I actually found a write-up by a mother who had just thought it was the crap.
9157732	9159213	She wasn't interested in it.
9159273	9160573	She thought it was corrupting her kids.
9160974	9166516	And then actually took the time to sit and go through the entire thing and ended up loving the story.
9166816	9168457	I mean, a mom probably in her 50s.
9169617	9170859	Ended up really liking it.
9170999	9174824	And, you know, already a sci-fi fan found things that she could relate to in it.
9175745	9181093	And I think that, you know, maybe if I had sat down and watched it, then maybe I would have liked it.
9181393	9184657	But I didn't care enough.
9184838	9185899	And I didn't bash it.
9186320	9187181	I don't think I bashed it, did I?
9188267	9188587	I don't know.
9189068	9191910	Chris109 in our chatroom says, Video games rule.
9192290	9193030	I agree, dude.
9193070	9193951	Video games rule.
9194291	9195812	And Chris109 says, Opinions.
9196172	9199134	They are awesome, yet cause issues because people misunderstand it.
9199695	9200075	You know what?
9200375	9206659	I'm going to say thank you for the email, and I think if people think we need to be called out on something, then do it.
9207860	9209601	Tone is going to be very important in that.
9209841	9214304	If we get an email that says, Fuck you, you fucking fuck, then we're probably not going to respond to that in kind.
9214384	9215785	Because that's probably one of my emails.
9216126	9216526	Yeah.
9217066	9219868	But, well, it goes back to that Facebook comment from a couple weeks ago.
9219948	9225331	You know, as long as you do it respectfully, we'll give you, you know, we'll have a respectful dialogue.
9225511	9227972	And then at the end of the day, have a beer and play some games.
9228232	9231054	I don't think that the email was disrespectful.
9232111	9232731	I don't either.
9232891	9238452	It was a little bit pointed, but I understand why there's anger.
9238793	9250035	But I also think that at the same time, just because, and this is something I kind of wished I'd put in my article too, and I do understand that if you're not going to watch something, it doesn't put you in a position to bash it.
9250115	9258637	However, it doesn't mean that you can't take a community-wide opinion and report on it, which is what we did.

9281426	9292203	well okay let's be real though yes I have heard plenty of Nickelback unfortunately and all that's just I think we can all agree Nickelback sucks all right next email sorry
9292947	9295229	Seasons Greetings and Salutations, OLR.
9295289	9296270	I love when people say that.
9296330	9297651	You know what movie that line came from?
9298171	9298491	Heathers.
9299812	9301153	Greetings and Salutations.
9301193	9301834	I love Heathers.
9301914	9302514	That movie is great.
9302534	9303275	I need to watch that.
9303515	9304556	Had Shannon Doherty in it.
9304576	9305156	She was awesome.
9305917	9306677	So was Winona Ryder.
9306717	9307638	I love Winona Ryder.
9307698	9309659	I want her to be my sister or something.
9309779	9317465	When Winona Ryder showed up... My dream family is like George Takei as my daddy and Winona Ryder as like my cool older sister.
9318326	9319066	Betty White as your grandma.
9319126	9319947	Betty White is my grandmother.
9319967	9320027	And...
9322495	9325497	When Winona Ryder showed up in Star Trek, I was so excited.
9325798	9328080	I know, and then they cut like half her scenes.
9328340	9329100	It was so disappointing.
9329561	9330281	Anyway.
9330301	9330622	Okay, anyway.
9331182	9333484	Firstly, I hope Rob is recovering from the VOG plague.
9333924	9338228	First, I heard it affect Jess from USL, then Shane from Horde House, now Alan and Rob.
9338468	9342271	To prevent yourselves from getting the plague, all VOG members should perform the anti-VOG plague ritual.
9342351	9346975	It involves a dead hippo, burnt out TV tubes, short bits of string, and fire-breathing squirrel.
9347555	9347635	No.
9347956	9348056	No.
9348675	9350796	I feel a lot better today than I did yesterday.
9351517	9354258	I don't have a temperature and I'm not congested in the head.
9354358	9355899	It's just I have stuffiness.
9355939	9357040	But I'll be back to work tomorrow.
9357060	9360682	It just sucks to be sick on a weekend when I had social stuff planned.
9361842	9363023	I love everybody in the chat.
9364263	9365904	Chris1 and I know they really suck.
9368507	9373730	Anyways, the reason I am emailing you all is because this week has been a significant week for my mobile gaming.
9374130	9377452	For the past few months, I've been playing a mobile game called Jurassic Park Builder.
9378092	9383295	It's basically your run-of-the-mill sim game involving filling your park with dinosaurs and leveling them to create cash.
9383615	9384436	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9406914	9412026	With that being said, have you ever encountered an update on a non-MMO game that changed the very nature of the original game?
9412407	9413750	How did you feel about those changes?
9413950	9415494	Not so sincerely, Degenerate Johnny.
9416254	9421756	That's a really tough question because in this day and age, I mean, we're used to the whole patching and things like that.
9421796	9427539	But, like, you know, that's something new in the past 10 years where games are updated like that and changed like that.
9427559	9428779	That's only new since iPhone.
9429160	9430560	I honestly can't think of anything.
9430960	9431821	I know one.
9432741	9433541	Mortal Kombat 2.
9433621	9433962	Yeah.
9434502	9438944	From the beta versions to the new ones because you lost your infinite combos as they tweak stuff.
9439084	9439304	Ooh.
9439864	9459206	Luminous on the iPhone actually made it playable because the first version was awful but then they actually changed the control scheme and it's actually playable that was a big one let me say this though, I'll answer the question with this so I'm going to take it a slightly different direction, sorry about it but back in the day I remember when sequels would go in really random directions
9459406	9473493	Like Zelda 2 Right, Zelda 2 for better or worse I did a Let's Remember this week, plug plug On my YouTube channel, Rob Roberts Plays YouTube.com slash Rob Roberts Plays, plug plug But I did a Let's Remember for the game Donkey Kong 3 Yes, that one was bizarre Wasn't it?
9473673	9479156	Yes, it was very bizarre Because it was such a departure And I even talked about this in the video Such a departure from Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.
9479556	9482358	Because those two were platformers Although I think it had more in common with Jr.
9482658	9484459	Well, Donkey Kong 3 was a fucking shooter game
9484679	9487721	Yeah, but... Disguised as Donkey, with the Donkey Kong skin on it.
9487861	9493065	But the otherwise look of the game, I think, had more in common with Junior.
9493305	9494887	Except for the fact that... The aesthetic was the same.
9494967	9499010	Stanley disappeared, never to be seen again, except in obscure references in Smash Bros.
9499070	9499270	I mean...
9500110	9502311	and I think was in a Game & Watch game but that's really it.
9502631	9508072	But I think about like back in the NES games sometimes sequels were really radical departures from the original games.
9508272	9508752	Absolutely.
9509172	9517914	Even like Castlevania 2 really played I mean sure it was still the whole like jump and whip and all that type of stuff that the first game had.
9517934	9519435	But what a terrible night for a curse.
9519535	9524776	But the first game was more of an arcade game where the second game was more of an adventure you know backdrop.
9524796	9526356	It was more of an annoying game.
9526856	9528077	I love the sequel though.
9528497	9529097	3 was great.
9529517	9532218	Anyway, that's the best we can do with the answers there.
9532559	9535940	By the way, SSJ100 Matt says that Heathers is going to be an off-Broadway show.
9536060	9538822	Well, I was going to say in chat as well, Ragenator talking about Heathers.
9539222	9544265	Ragenator in chat says, Heathers also gave us the line, Well, fuck me gently with a chainsaw.
9545305	9545886	Oh, God.
9545986	9549568	It also gave us the line, Big fun was one.
9549608	9549908	Big fun.
9550328	9552969	And I love my dead gay son.
9558133	9560876	If you're a fan of Orange Launch Radio, you do need to watch the movie Heathers.
9560916	9562077	Have you seen the movie Heathers, Loki?
9562117	9562958	Please tell me you've seen Heathers.
9563398	9563539	No.
9563779	9565280	Oh my god, Loki!
9565300	9566081	You're killing me!
9566121	9566802	Oh my god!
9566822	9567843	That's the best movie!
9571026	9572428	It also was like
9574785	9577451	They used to play it on Comedy Central like every other day.
9577912	9580837	Great pate, but I really must dash if I'm going to meet that funeral.
9580857	9582601	Alright, anyway.
9583964	9585767	Watch Heathers this holiday season.
9585807	9586649	You'll thank us later.
9586972	9592873	And it's the movie that got Que Sera Sera stuck in my head every time someone says the name Heather.
9594453	9598914	Que Sera Sera Anyway, last email.
9599694	9612317	Dear Orange Lounge Radio, with the release of some less than stellar Wii U and Super Mario 3D World sales figures this week, this past week, sorry, it has been provided yet another excuse for doom and gloom for the console.
9612877	9641990	this led me to wonder when exactly sales figures started mattering to people who aren't investors more than liking the games of the systems that were being played I myself have loved my Wii U since release date and it has absolutely changed how gaming has fit into my life my boyfriend has become an avid gamer due to a mixture of first party titles and indie releases that he would never have bothered playing elsewhere the system never fails to create memories at parties and Nintendo's mastery of the couch co-op style of gameplay is still as evident as ever
9643274	9655162	but even loving the system as much as I do I am still given pause to doubt myself when I hear people focus so heavily on something as impersonal as sales data as something that should speak to the quality of a system
9656844	9657185	DarkSakura.com
9681227	9709311	so my question to you is this now that companies make such public displays of game sales and sales data for gaming related products are so easy to locate is liking a product enough I'm always willing to speak well for titles I enjoy never to the exclusion of others whenever the topic arises but is there something else that can be done to improve the image of products such as Super Mario 3D World which will likely have its spectacular reviews overshadowed by being one of the lowest selling 3D Mario titles ever
9712179	9712559	was that it?
9713441	9729720	thank you for the entertainment you provide each week and Daniel because I don't say last names on there I think that was a good email and thank you for that and thank you for your masterful grammar sales shouldn't matter to your enjoyment of the game
9730054	9730474	No, it shouldn't.
9730594	9734436	And I think, don't we all, I mean, Oh, for fuck's sake, I like Xanadu.
9735936	9737937	But haven't we talked about this on a previous show as well?
9737957	9743219	There's those cult games that maybe not everybody necessarily played, but you love, right?
9743259	9747881	Like I talked about, there's a great card game called Cold Sept that's like Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering.
9748041	9748601	Love those games.
9748981	9750482	But like, they don't sell beans here.
9750522	9755364	In fact, I think they didn't even come out with a 3DS version here because those games didn't sell very well, which was a tragedy.
9755924	9758365	But, you know, yeah, you should like what you're going to like.
9759510	9763034	There should be no shame in your game.
9763275	9768040	I love bad movies better than some of the top rated Oscar winning movies ever.
9768460	9771964	I picked up Barbarella recently and I fucking love that movie because Jane Fonda was hot.
9772064	9772344	Sorry.
9773586	9774126	But I mean...
9777592	9779533	It shouldn't be a guilty pleasure.
9779593	9781294	It should just be a pleasure.
9781394	9783695	And if you love it, fucking love it.
9783755	9789258	It doesn't matter how well or how niche or how many copies is sold or anything.
9789278	9790319	Just like what you like.
9790479	9791620	Yeah.
9792320	9793000	I think you're right.
9793020	9800164	I think there's a lot of... Well, it's the whole thing about some people feel that theirs has to be the best, that theirs is better than everybody else.
9800204	9801645	It's that whole fanboyism.
9802345	9803066	Oh, yeah, in the chat?
9803246	9803566	Yeah.
9803726	9803826	Oh.
9804406	9805167	Well, that awesome...
9805547	9809991	I love you, Awesome Unicorn, because I also read grammar and etymology books for fun.
9810251	9813494	You should change your nick to Awesome Emailing Unicorn.
9815316	9815996	What was I going to say?
9818739	9820720	You made me lose my tangent with that.
9821281	9821841	I lose my thought.
9823277	9826478	Barbarella, Psychedella.
9827039	9830200	But people should play whatever they want and like it.
9830440	9831301	Oh yeah, the fanboyism.
9831781	9838744	People will use sales figures and wield it as a weapon as something like, look at what's going on with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
9838884	9840385	They're both selling well.
9840845	9845889	But still the fanboys are going to say, oh, well, but it's because the number of regions this is selling in.
9845909	9848050	And it's because of, you know, such and such.
9848150	9850992	And to be fair, we've asked those same questions on the show.
9851032	9855515	But that's because we know there's spin going into this from Microsoft and Sony.
9855555	9859478	And we are kind of curious, like, which one is selling a little better.
9859498	9862000	But that doesn't make the other system worse necessarily.
9862480	9863661	I'm a Wii U owner.
9864221	9886312	I like my Wii U an awful lot even though I didn't necessarily care for the wonderful 101 and I'm gonna hear shit about that non-stop this week but I love Mario 3D World it is one of my top five games of the year for sure and I know Nintendo's gonna put out some great stuff for it in 2014 and there are more reasons to buy a Wii U right now than there are to buy a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One
9887182	9888663	Will that be the same story in 2014?
9889304	9892947	That's what I'm a little worried about for Nintendo's sake.
9893248	9894749	But 3DS will keep them afloat.
9894809	9895350	And you know what?
9896251	9897252	Like whatever you're going to like.
9897272	9901616	There's lots of great games to justify a Wii U purchase.
9902396	9905419	Love is not wrong, but it can sometimes be really gross and sticky.
9907651	9907971	Alright.
9908971	9909291	Is that it?
9910212	9910492	Yerp.
9910712	9911592	That is it for emails.
9911632	9916653	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com And by the way, I would like to go back and still thank NARP for the email.
9917493	9920393	Thank you for being honest with us and making your opinion known.
9920554	9921934	I said thank you for that email as well, didn't I?
9921954	9925074	But I didn't say thank you and I'm saying thank you so he doesn't think I'm a total bitch.
9925094	9926655	I'm only a 95% bitch.
9927635	9931036	Thank you to Jenner and Johnny too because I don't think we thanked him for the email either.
9931096	9933116	And thank you Unicorn Friend with the great grammar.
9935222	9938144	Alright, thank you to everybody who takes the time out of the week to say hello to us.
9938184	9938504	We appreciate it.
9938524	9942927	And thank you to anybody else who loves Xanadu and Barbarella because those are the two best movies ever.
9943908	9944428	Uh, no.
9945389	9947890	You watched them at my bachelorette party.
9947931	9948231	I did.
9948251	9950472	When we were eating jello shots.
9950532	9951413	What is this fuckery?
9951493	9954015	And it was awesome because I fucking love those movies.
9954035	9957597	Of course, then again, I love showgirls and that's my Halloween tradition is to watch showgirls.
9957817	9961279	Which we did at my house and drank wine and watched showgirls and it was great.
9961299	9962380	And Miss Monet was with us.
9962480	9963101	Is she a gamer?
9963281	9964301	Because we need to get her on the show.
9964341	9964962	I don't think she is.
9965439	9966861	But we should have her on the show anyway.
9966941	9967421	We should.
9967522	9969163	She can teach a pole dancing class during the show.
9969224	9970825	Our friend Monet is a pole dancer.
9970865	9972928	I used to work with Monet, which I knew Monet before.
9973869	9975811	I knew Rob, and I knew Monet separately.
9976732	9978514	And then I found out that they knew each other.
9978574	9980577	It's like my circle of Rob.
9980677	9980917	Yeah.
9981538	9984241	Because there's Kat and... Yeah, Kat through Rocky.
9984261	9985262	And you guys know Mystique.
9985522	9985682	Yep.
9988525	9991507	For my birthday party last year, Monet had a pole dancing class.
9991527	9996891	We talked about this on Horde House because Extifer came to the pole dancing class and he was really good at it.
9996931	9997632	This was so random.
9997652	10002115	Apparently him and Monet ran into each other at a postal service concert and they remembered each other.
10002856	10004858	The world is such a small, funny place sometimes.
10006459	10009501	There was mention on my Facebook about doing a Cards Against Humanity session.
10009661	10010322	Good times.
10010342	10012283	I've been getting my 12 days of Cards Against Humanity.
10014585	10020450	Alright, this is too much talking about people that our listeners don't know, so we need to get into the F- We need to introduce our listeners to these people.
10020550	10020770	We do.
10020810	10022011	We need to get into the F-U's of the week.
10038244	10040446	DarkSakura, F-U's of the week.
10041587	10041987	I'm good.
10042588	10043168	F-U to the sick.
10043448	10043949	F-U to the plague.
10045109	10063702	I will follow her because I have the exact same FU FU to the fact that I got sick especially when I had a weekend where I actually had a bunch of stuff planned I was supposed to go wine tasting with friends this weekend who drove up from out of town and I couldn't fucking go but they did the most adorable thing for me and I just love friends hugs and kisses if you guys are out there listening
10064862	10071967	and I was supposed to go to a big holiday party with some of my friends here locally and that was supposed to be Friday night.
10072007	10075929	Couldn't go because I was sick and it's rude to go to a dinner party when you're sick and cough on all the food.
10076689	10077990	So, boo!
10078831	10079091	Anyhow.
10080031	10080291	Loki?
10081352	10087456	I'm just F'ed to the fact that I still have to heal up for a while before I can actually eat real food.
10087476	10087516	So...
10090257	10092159	Everybody's giving FUs tonight to Conditions.
10093241	10093961	It's a theme tonight.
10094002	10095603	You should puree some turkey.
10095663	10096604	And why not?
10096705	10100569	Let's give an FU to Volition and Deep Silver for their fucking broken-ass game.
10101970	10102811	I would like to play that.
10103232	10104333	Oh, I have another FU.
10104854	10105034	Yeah?
10105154	10106836	And it goes to you and Victoria.
10106976	10107577	Hey, FU.
10108237	10109179	For Frivalo.
10110291	10111412	Oh, it's great wine, isn't it?
10111432	10114014	Because I bought a bottle, and normally I'm not a sweet wine person.
10114755	10118037	As I described this to Victoria, it tastes like angels pissed in my cup.
10119539	10120239	It was amazing.
10122141	10123162	Frivolo's really good.
10123262	10125544	That winery should pay me money for that endorsement.
10125944	10127425	For the record, don't buy it at Whole Foods.
10127465	10128946	Go to Total Wine because it's four bucks cheaper.
10129207	10129787	Just saying.
10129847	10130728	Or just go to the winery.
10130768	10131268	It's not far.
10131368	10132089	Well, if you live here.
10133230	10134131	You've never taken me.
10134351	10135752	You need to take me, Rob, next time you go.
10136813	10137073	All right.
10137693	10138754	Anyway, let's see.
10139734	10140514	What else do I want to say?
10141395	10142715	We've got a couple more stories for you guys.
10142795	10147857	And then Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR and our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
10147897	10149358	Although I've got to admit, I'm a little bit worried.
10149478	10151319	Bobby didn't have a single caller tonight on his show.
10151759	10154260	Are we going to get people to call into Orange Launch Radio?
10154300	10154840	We shall see.
10155761	10156481	Coming up in a moment.
10156521	10158202	But first, some quick stories here.
10158242	10158442	Loki.
10159322	10161724	The Oculus Rift is moving along.
10161824	10172512	They just received $75 million in funding from the venture capital firm Andresen Horowitz, led by Mark Anderson Horowitz.
10175554	10178316	Why does it seem like there's too many, or Andreessen?
10179276	10181177	There's too many letters in these words.
10182098	10183599	It's like they have extra E's in there.
10185600	10188561	Anyways, and he's the founder of Netscape.
10189522	10190723	Man, I remember Netscape.
10190763	10193304	That was the browser to go to before Firefox.
10193344	10193804	It was.
10194024	10194945	Netscape was the bomb.
10195125	10195545	Yeah.
10195585	10197646	Dial into Prodigy, then fire up Netscape.
10197726	10201048	You know what we used to call it back when I was on AOL because there was a big rivalry?
10201188	10201629	Nutscape.
10201729	10202009	No, no.
10202449	10203049	Prodigy, I mean.
10203069	10203870	We called it Buttigy.
10204210	10204511	S, Actdeft, Drew,
10214280	10243461	uh yes my first website was designed in Netscape that shit was the bomb um so anyways so they um apparently they liked what they saw and you know I'm sure 75 million dollars in funding can only help um they've already secured I guess previously 16 million dollars in the first round of funding in June so I'm very uh very curious to see what happens hopefully one day I will have an Oculus Rift myself but uh
10245523	10246283	Getting closer.
10246984	10254346	Getting closer to this total immersion future or something.
10255487	10261149	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says, On Prodigy, we just called AOL, AOL because that was insulting enough.
10262689	10264210	You know, I remember AOL when it was DOS.
10265578	10286882	I remember when it was free because they kept sending you those 30 day trials No, I remember having a phish account I didn't phish it either I remember when AOL was Quantum Link on the Commodore 64 and yeah, I used to dial into BBSs on my 300 baud modem It's hardcore, bitches, hardcore
10287697	10298441	You know, I still have my same, when they went to where you could have your free accounts, I actually still have the same username on my AIM from that account.
10298601	10299361	It's DarkSakura.
10299621	10300001	That's amazing.
10300021	10301382	But I hide so no one can find me.
10301582	10304763	I was going to say, wait a minute, now you're going to get tons of AOL instant messages.
10304803	10305283	No, I'm not.
10305403	10306684	Who uses instant messenger anymore?
10306784	10308044	Me and Becky and Victoria.
10308124	10308564	Oh, really?
10308724	10309205	A few people.
10309365	10309605	Wow.
10309925	10310565	I never use it.
10310605	10313926	Most of the people are people I've been friends with from my old AOL days.
10313986	10315267	I didn't use Facebook Messenger either.
10316107	10319614	I have a messenger that I prefer but even then I only talk to like two people on it.
10319795	10326007	I only keep AIM up because there's maybe like a handful of people and sometimes some of my friends from Alabama are on it.
10326067	10327149	It's all text messages now.
10327469	10328211	It's kind of where people went.
10328487	10329748	Yeah, but it's easier to type.
10329968	10330749	Yeah, I understand.
10331209	10341238	Alright, one more story for you guys, and don't read too much into this, but it's very exciting to know that Nintendo has renewed the trademark for Metroid Prime.
10341799	10347264	And a lot of people are doing, you know, shaking and crying because, ooh, this means there's going to be a new Metroid Prime on Wii U.
10347964	10348725	Well, there might be.
10348765	10349285	You never know.
10349365	10362894	I mean, it would certainly make a lot of sense for Retro to go and do another Metroid Prime game for the Wii U. But we do know that the trademark was renewed on August 13, 2013, probably just to protect, you know, the games that already exist.
10363194	10366336	because you know Nintendo loves to package up its old shit eventually.
10366356	10372760	And on the next Nintendo console, we'll probably have GameCube games and Wii games downloadable.
10373260	10376262	So, you know, they just want to keep that trademark out there for sure.
10376322	10378863	But wouldn't it be nice to have another Metroid Prime game?
10379584	10382506	Maybe that will be their ace in the hole at E3.
10382626	10382926	We'll see.
10384892	10385493	Thanks for watching!
10407034	10408916	Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line.
10409296	10409756	It's open.
10409776	10412719	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype.
10412879	10414340	Orange Lounge Radio.
10414420	10416221	You can give us a call right now if you'd like.
10416642	10420785	If there's anything you want to share or talk about maybe that we didn't bring up or something we did bring up.
10420805	10421105	Who knows?
10422386	10424328	Give us a call and we will talk about it.
10425388	10431593	In the meantime, I'm going to go to Twitter topics and see if Loki has any last minute stories or Dark Sakura.
10431633	10431954	Who knows?
10432494	10432814	Nope.
10432834	10436297	No, I don't really have anything at the moment.
10437250	10440232	All right, well, good thing the phone is ringing and we can actually go to some calls.
10440272	10441313	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10441333	10441693	Who's this?
10442393	10445335	The only one with the fastest internet finger in the whole wide internet chat.
10445415	10445936	It's Ranma.
10446016	10447176	You're very good at this, Ranma.
10447196	10447917	What's on your mind, buddy?
10448577	10449178	I do try.
10449358	10453220	There are some topics I do want to cover real quick, and I got to be on my merry little way.
10453340	10453640	Okay.
10454401	10460705	See, I feel with Loki, with the whole dentist thing, because once I went to, I have my
10461574	10480334	3 Impacted Teeth Pulled Out Before I Had To Do An 8 Hour Shift At Work Oh God I'm Thinking Okay Get It Done Drop Off The Meds Go To Work Won't Be That Big Of A Deal 20 Minutes Into My Shift I'm Like It Hurts It Hurts
10481769	10483310	Take my break, grab the meds.
10483490	10487193	I was pretty much floating on cloud nine for the next eight hours after that.
10489974	10492116	Oh my, how did you even work a shift on those?
10492836	10495898	I can't believe you didn't just somehow get the day off or something.
10495938	10496259	I don't know.
10496819	10498680	I have a high tolerance for pain.
10499161	10502803	There was that time that I dislocated my knee and they gave me Tylenol 3.
10503884	10505325	They gave me a weak prescription.
10505425	10506666	I only needed it for one day.
10507106	10507246	Hmm.
10510233	10510733	Let's see.
10511134	10514075	The whole YouTube debacle about them flagging videos.
10514256	10514816	That's okay.
10515016	10515877	I understand.
10516717	10521000	I feel those users' pains because some of my videos get flagged as well.
10522119	10532063	Some of our OLR episodes that have been posted on YouTube are getting flagged, and it's making me question if we should continue to do it, to be honest, because it was all a kind of experiment anyway.
10532183	10538286	But there's been a couple people who have been very vocal about their support of the YouTube posting, so I am trying to stick it out for them.
10539246	10542467	It's so very nice that they welcome us with open arms.
10542787	10544908	Well, hey, you fucking stole that shit.
10545248	10546069	Did you make that?
10546109	10547709	That's how I feel, but whatever.
10547869	10548970	Anyway, sorry, Rama.
10549910	10551591	It's cool, it's cool, because the issue is...
10552389	10562291	With my videos, the Japanese come to make the albums of Sony, EMI, and them.
10562711	10574674	They will have the videos flagged because us videographers who record masquerades, they realize we didn't get permission to use their music in the video, and I'm like,
10575856	10577337	I didn't put the song there.
10577677	10578998	It was part of the skit.
10579098	10581640	It was part of the musical or whatever.
10581921	10585323	And I just put back, I just, under fair use, leave me alone, please.
10585903	10588325	Worst case scenario, some countries can't see my videos.
10588966	10589206	Yeah.
10590227	10592608	Still, that's so irritating to even have to go through that, you know?
10593029	10594530	Yeah.
10594890	10597212	The whole 38 Studios bid, I'll tell you what.
10598032	10598833	I will give 38 Studios...
10601260	10603463	Fair value for all their franchises.
10604545	10603463	$20.
10604645	10608311	I believe I'm being more than fair.
10608511	10610374	That's not even the price of the game.
10612397	10613619	Well, maybe it is now, actually.
10613639	10614640	I could be wrong.
10614660	10615702	It could be the price of the game now.
10618312	10622173	I'm just thinking there's not a lot of call out there for a sequel to Kingdoms of Amalur.
10622213	10624094	Although I know some people really liked it.
10624194	10625214	It's not like I heard nothing.
10625534	10627015	It's not like it was a crap game.
10627355	10628995	It was decent from what I hear.
10629095	10632557	So I'm actually kind of surprised no one wants the sequel rights.
10632657	10634217	But whatever.
10636598	10637038	It's weird.
10637789	10643516	Yeah, and last thing before I get out of here, I am returning to my Pokemon roots.
10644277	10646920	Oh, you going back to red and blue, or what are you doing?
10647561	10648682	I'm playing the game again.
10648782	10651024	I picked up a copy of Y. You know what?
10651085	10652847	The new 3DS games are really good.
10653267	10654308	Are you having fun with it so far?
10655149	10656770	I don't know, it's still sealed.
10656890	10661392	I told myself I am not unwrapping Y till I finish A Link Between Worlds.
10662533	10667895	That's fair, because I was going to say, if you're going to sit there with an unopened copy of the game, I will sick Shane Alinko on you.
10668335	10669576	And he will use his powers.
10669876	10674318	By the way, I'm fairly certain that Dan's gifting me that for a holiday mess.
10675759	10681161	I'm getting X. I told him I wanted X. So you'll have somebody to trade Pokemans with.
10682122	10684183	I only bought the game for one reason.
10685429	10688933	Toys R Us had it on sale last week for $20.
10688993	10690314	I got Best Buy to price match it.
10690555	10691015	Here you go.
10691055	10691636	It's a good deal.
10691716	10692837	It's a steal for that game.
10692877	10694279	That's what I did with my Mass Effect 3.
10694779	10695620	Got it for $10 cheaper.
10695781	10696141	Why not?
10696962	10700326	And then everyone on my Facebook is like, can I get it for X?
10700346	10700986	Can I get it for X?
10701026	10702148	I'm like, I don't know.
10702468	10703009	Take it in.
10703429	10703789	Ask them.
10703810	10704650	They might be nice.
10704670	10705471	A couple of people have said...
10706092	10710697	Best Buy was able to price match it for X as well because they're practically the same game.
10710797	10711698	Yeah, they are the same game.
10712018	10712398	Pretty much.
10713519	10715341	Alright, Ranma, thanks so much for the call.
10715441	10716542	Appreciate it.
10716642	10717003	Take care.
10717043	10717944	An anime jam session.
10717984	10718564	Everybody listen.
10718584	10719065	Tuesday nights.
10719625	10720947	Oh yeah, one more thing before I get out of here.
10722288	10726893	Next week, I do believe, is the 24th for our show.
10726953	10729655	That's going to be our final show of the holiday before we take a break.
10729775	10729976	Uh-huh.
10731342	10737949	We will be doing the anime jam session or getting crunked Christmas Eve special.
10738229	10739971	You guys are going live on Christmas Eve?
10740031	10740832	That's impressive.
10740872	10741733	You guys are hardcore.
10742968	10751995	It's because we'd rather get drunk with our friends and guests than our own families because if we're with our families, we're going to drink anyway.
10752515	10753035	I love it.
10753856	10759400	Unfortunately, I have plans with my own family on Christmas Eve, but if I get back in time, I'll join y'all for a round.
10760440	10762882	I'm probably going to have to drink to make it through our Christmas Eve.
10762902	10763643	I know, right?
10763823	10769787	Don't want to spend Christmas with your family, spend Christmas with the drunken bastards at Anime Jam Session.
10769887	10770427	I love it.
10770547	10771007	I love it.
10771047	10771948	We'll have a great show.
10772008	10775209	But you still have one more show before that because this week coming up is the 17th.
10775389	10777690	This week, yeah, we have a lot of stuff coming up.
10777750	10780691	And then that following week, all bets are off.
10780851	10781651	All bets are off.
10781671	10782131	You know what?
10782191	10786593	This week is the Horde House holiday special, and I'm going to tell you it's a doozy.
10787393	10788194	Hold on to your butts.
10789354	10791575	Well, I only have one thing to say about that.
10791695	10791895	Huh.
10792655	10793736	May the fierce be with you.
10794976	10795557	Okay.
10795737	10796037	All right.
10796057	10796697	Talk to you later.
10797197	10797458	All right.
10797538	10797718	Bye.
10798158	10799158	Have a Beyonce day.
10799719	10799999	All right.
10801540	10801860	Actually, wait.
10801900	10802920	Ranma doesn't like Beyonce.
10802960	10803200	Oh, well.
10803221	10806162	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10806302	10807283	May be Jesus be with you.
10808303	10809684	Or use your name on Skype.
10810124	10811225	Orange Lounge Radio.
10811365	10812045	All one word.
10812265	10816287	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
10816327	10817028	Let's go to the phones.
10817068	10817928	I think we have another call.
10817968	10818949	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10818969	10819329	Who's this?
10820229	10821230	This is Ragenator.
10821270	10822490	Hey Ragenator, how you doing?
10823371	10823871	I'm pretty good.
10824391	10825071	What's up?
10825672	10826452	Well, two things.
10826992	10841359	I was going to do a rant about the whole YouTube group I have, but since that's going to take a little while, I just want to get the quick thing out of the way.
10843139	10847861	Since I'm feeling a little generous, I'm going to do a little game giveaway, a Steam game.
10848282	10848882	Okay.
10849878	10864208	Yeah, in fact, this weekend, since it was a steam sale on DinoDA, where the game was basically $2 for a single copy or a four-pack for $6, I can't figure what the hell.
10864708	10868911	Pick up the four-pack, keep a copy for myself, give away $8.
10869231	10870432	He's Santinator tonight.
10870592	10871593	Tonight he's Santinator.
10873394	10875656	So I can't figure what the hell.
10876328	10882031	Give away one of the copies of the game tonight on OR.
10882892	10897000	And what we'll do is, well, I'm going to ask a question directly in chat, that way you guys don't get an unfair advantage because of the delay.
10900675	10906825	Now the first person that answers the question directly, go ahead and shout the answer out in
10908030	10909491	No, in text, in chat, who will get the game?
10909511	10910812	And I'm posting it right now.
10910852	10914815	I'm going to let the chatters have it, but I'm almost positive I know what it is.
10914855	10916636	Does it have to do with cards?
10916716	10916796	Yeah.
10936289	10937090	I can't say.
10937250	10938250	All right.
10938270	10939150	I think it does.
10939190	10939771	There's your hint.
10940191	10940451	All right.
10941871	10944052	So you wanted to rant a little bit on the YouTube thing.
10944092	10948994	Now, I'm going to ask you to try to keep it a little bit concise because we do want to end the show at a reasonable hour.
10949054	10950314	But what's your thoughts on the YouTube thing?
10950915	10951175	All right.
10951675	10952315	Here's the thing.
10952615	10962979	On one hand, I know that companies be it Nintendo or Valve or Microsoft, whoever, yeah, they would like to protect their IPs.
10963871	10983460	That's understandable, but at the same time, you know, fans being Bobby Blackwell, yourself, me, whoever, we like these games, we want to support games, and we want to promote the games.
10984960	10988882	And what we do is show off these games, and
10990313	10995135	We're effectively giving these games free publicity.
10995575	11007401	We're doing PR for these games and the game manufacturers are not paying us one red cent for this promotion.
11007641	11008701	Let me ask you this though, Rachel.
11008741	11016905	I'm going to interrupt you real quick just to ask a tough question because, you know, yes, we're giving the games free publicity, but doesn't a game maker have a right to say, I don't want that publicity?
11019325	11020706	That's one way to look at it.
11020946	11025167	I didn't look at it that way or consider it.
11026308	11033170	But at the same time, I can't figure out why a company wouldn't want free publicity for the game.
11033210	11042553	Because I already mentioned that assuming that the game isn't crap, they want publicity for the games because usually they'll get extra sales.
11042613	11047115	Like Casey Point earlier this year, Bobby Blackwell,
11047950	11057037	On Twitch, he had showed off Sacred Citadel, which is the Go Force and Conquer game.
11057518	11062962	And I saw his stream and I liked the game, bought the game.
11063582	11066945	So, what was it, Deep Silver that put the game out?
11067682	11070503	They made $15 off of me because of their stream.
11091707	11099452	but it's when you have these other websites like 4Gamer or Machinima or whatever and they're the ones that I get content ID matched with.
11099552	11106497	That's not right because it wasn't their stuff to content match in the first place.
11106577	11107617	It wasn't their game.
11107637	11109399	You know what I mean?
11109419	11110459	Yeah.
11110920	11111140	All right.
11111620	11112781	Rage Leader, I got to let you go.
11113681	11117604	Let us know though in chat who ends up winning that code and we will talk to you later.
11118596	11119738	Alright, have a nice night
11133936	11138457	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
11139758	11140338	Let's see.
11140498	11142518	Going to some of the tweets that we got tonight.
11143458	11147840	Redertainment sent us a tweet that we did touch on earlier in the show, but just to mention it again.
11148160	11150380	The Read Only Memories Kickstarter got funded.
11150460	11150880	Yay!
11151220	11154861	And I noticed MidBoss Games even retweeted our tweet that we were going live tonight.
11154901	11156382	So they're supporting us just like we supported.
11156562	11157322	You guys rule!
11158612	11159433	You guys rule.
11160293	11161074	I'm feeling the love.
11161274	11162315	I am feeling the love.
11162935	11165517	Just you wait for Gamer X 2.
11166117	11167758	The whole lot of you are getting glomped.
11169200	11169900	Right, DarkSakura?
11170520	11171101	If I get to go.
11171121	11172882	Alright, you will.
11173723	11174503	We'll make it work out.
11175164	11177345	So, Rob, you have to cosplay with me.
11177846	11178266	Oh, God.
11179487	11183730	Okay, if I lose 20 pounds, then I will cosplay with you.
11185011	11185951	That's not gonna happen.
11185971	11186051	What?
11187608	11188248	Fuck you!
11189469	11190449	I had to go there.
11190629	11190769	No.
11191230	11191450	Rob.
11191470	11193471	Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery.
11193671	11193831	No.
11194111	11194631	It can happen.
11194991	11198233	But I would invite you to go to the gym with me.
11199026	11227698	you know I go to the other gym I know you do but I can get you into my gym alright anyway we'll talk later about that meanwhile we got some tweets if my fat ass could lose 20 pounds you could do it easy no fat shaming we shouldn't fat shame but I can say I'm fat if I want to but I saw that video this week but anyway you know what I feel for health reasons I feel I know I can be better have a better body than the one I'm at you know what as long as you love you
11229068	11255355	I know I can do I do love me but I know I can do better all right anyway um moving on awkward talk moving on uh we have some tweets SSU and Hunter Matt guy trollingly applies to a college football coaching job citing his years of Madden and NCAAF playing do you do you think that do you think that we would be eligible for a job at a gaming company just because we did this podcast
11257344	11265312	I will actually, I will say, and I think I've talked about this on the show, I'm not going to tell you who, but twice I've applied for positions with gaming companies.
11266133	11274242	One of them I actually was really close with and I decided to, because I would have had to relocate and I would have had to stop doing the show and everything else.
11274702	11276264	I decided to not go forward with it.
11276284	11279887	I'm not going to tell you what it was, but you guys know I am a corporate teacher.
11280087	11281248	That's what I do during the day.
11281428	11283990	It was a corporate teaching job with a video game company.
11284090	11284471	That's cool.
11284531	11285812	And it would have been really cool.
11286132	11292578	And it was just the relocation kind of like I couldn't do it because of where they wanted me to go, you know, would have been tough.
11293118	11317160	but um yeah so um but yeah I mean like you know but but does the fact that we do a podcast mean we should work for video game companies not necessarily yes well I mean if it's graphic design then that for you that's good yeah Loki does sales you know so you know maybe that type of stuff would be good for him I would love to do design for like digital manuals and that type of thing
11318041	11321024	SSJ100 Matt says, I've cited OLR in a job interview once.
11321164	11321845	Didn't get the job.
11322245	11322925	Sorry to hear it.
11324807	11329571	I've used people for references, though, as people have listed Orange Lounge Radio as jobs.
11329591	11330652	Didn't you do that, DarkSakura?
11330672	11332654	You put OLR down and me as a professional contact?
11332674	11334315	I put OLR down.
11334335	11337358	Well, you were already one of my references.
11337758	11341522	But I put OLR down as a client for freelance design.
11342202	11344024	And I put myself down as art director for VOG.
11344244	11348765	I have used it as an example of management skills, doing this show and keeping you two in line.
11348865	11350706	I'm just kidding.
11350746	11352306	We all help each other out, to be honest.
11353367	11354467	All right, let's see.
11354507	11356487	I had one other tweet here I wanted to read.
11356548	11366770	Yes, it was from Eric RPG sent us a tweet, and it was just a link over to a Kickstarter for Grapple Knight is another Kickstarter.
11366790	11368631	So I'm assuming this is a Kickstarter he's behind.
11369031	11370152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11389103	11391925	We're going to get her back on the show for sure at some point.
11392005	11394987	But do you remember our buddy?
11395507	11400090	She came on the show right after it was announced she was going to be on the Tester 3.
11400530	11402571	Our buddy Asuka was on the show.
11403032	11405193	Now, funny enough, we didn't know this.
11405233	11406814	She called in just out of the blue.
11406834	11408035	We didn't arrange the interview or anything.
11408075	11409536	She knew a listener of the show.
11410276	11411877	I hope Stan's still listening if he's out there.
11411937	11413138	Thank you for hooking that up.
11413498	11418121	But she called into the show one night and it happened to be the week before she got kicked off the Tester 3.
11418601	11419882	Yes, she was very cool.
11419922	11420562	But she was very cool.
11420582	11421343	We had a lot of fun with her.
11421363	11421983	Well, get this.
11422864	11425245	She's on the King of the Nerds season two.
11426326	11430449	And I'm like, girl, I know you can't talk about if you won or lost the thing.
11430509	11431169	I understand that.
11431209	11435312	But I'm like, win or lose, you have been on the Tester and King of Nerds.
11435592	11438914	You are the nerdiest reality show contestant of all time.
11441522	11444424	So anyway, I just thought that was hilarious that she's on that show now.
11444464	11449188	So we'll have her back to talk about that, which sounds like Ranma saying, fuck King of the Nerds.
11449228	11451210	Well, he'll be really excited for that interview then.
11451910	11454072	Redertainment says she's on actual TV.
11454252	11454533	Yes.
11455754	11456314	Crazy, huh?
11458078	11459761	So anyway, let's see.
11459901	11461363	Other stuff I wanted to mention.
11462305	11471540	Peeker Uno tweeted the show and said, I missed last week's topic, but one of my favorite TV programs was Nightmare, a virtual reality RPG game show in the 90s.
11473030	11474251	I remember that kind of.
11474451	11475031	That's awesome.
11476072	11478333	Anyhow, I don't think we're getting any other calls.
11479334	11479834	So that's it.
11479854	11480354	LOL, bye.
11480375	11482356	Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
11482616	11483837	I have one last bit.
11484457	11486378	Go ahead, and then we'll close up shop for tonight.
11486398	11487379	So this is pretty exciting.
11487439	11488860	I've been actually waiting for this to happen.
11489040	11494023	Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition has now added Steam Workshop support.
11494043	11494523	Oh, yes.
11494723	11495844	And a level editor.
11496204	11499165	Wait, does it have multiplayer play yet online?
11499325	11500566	I'm assuming if it has the level.
11500806	11502726	I'm surprised it doesn't if it already.
11502786	11504147	But anyways, yeah.
11504187	11506067	There's a bombshell announcement I could use.
11506087	11507468	60 maps for download already.
11508048	11510709	And they're adding their own rating system and mini forum.
11511369	11516091	And the game's also 75% off until tomorrow, which means I'm going to have to buy it right now.
11516508	11517688	Oh my god, I just realized something.
11518089	11519769	I have to check Drunken Robot Pornography.
11520269	11520449	Why?
11520469	11521330	To see if they've updated.
11521690	11523230	Because remember, I've still been playing the alpha.
11523370	11523771	That's right.
11524411	11526331	Me too with Audio Surf 2.
11526952	11528212	It's been getting little updates here and there.
11528232	11534975	And now I've got my Steam card so I can buy... Yeah, I think you're going to have to buy the game being it's only $2.49.
11535835	11537055	Is it really?
11537295	11537575	It's only $2.49.
11537675	11539496	Ooh, that's a good one.
11539836	11540236	That's a good one.
11540256	11540516	Alright.
11540677	11542757	Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem 3D together, $3.74.
11542877	11542937	Wow.
11544998	11545578	Tempting, tempting.
11545618	11545859	All right.
11547179	11549020	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
11549280	11550721	Thank you guys so much for listening to us.
11550921	11553883	Stay in here for the whole show, the whole way through for us.
11553943	11565129	I hope we could entertain you during your day with our chatter about video games wherever you're listening to us, whether you're here live Sunday night just chilling with our show or if you're listening to us on your commute or at your workday on Monday.
11565889	11568711	Thank you so much for taking the time out to listen to Orange Launch Radio and supporting the show.
11569071	11570971	Support independent broadcasting.
11570991	11574852	There's so many hardworking people like us out there that do this just for the love of it.
11575172	11577913	Please go forth and download lots of indie podcasts.
11578253	11588795	Remember, word of mouth is key to the success of this show because there's so many of these big corporate podcasts that have much money in their pockets that can buy the promotion and so forth.
11589135	11589856	We can't do that.
11589896	11593336	So all we ask, if you enjoy the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
11593656	11594737	Help us spread the word.
11595017	11595997	They're not as cute as us.
11596757	11597238	No, they're not.
11597418	11597698	They're not.
11597718	11598158	We're very pretty.
11598178	11598798	We're super adorable.
11599319	11599799	Absolutely.
11599839	11601300	We are the most prettiest.
11603121	11605142	Thank you guys once again for checking out the show.
11606543	11607524	Leave a nice review.
11607644	11611286	If you wouldn't mind saying a nice word on iTunes reviews, that would be great.
11611386	11614107	Or Stitcher reviews are hugely helpful too.
11614648	11620911	I directly attribute the increase we've had in our exposure on Stitcher to those of you that are taking the time to write reviews.
11620931	11621612	So thank you so much.
11622313	11634068	and I don't know what else to say thank you guys again for listening you guys are great and have a great holiday season let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts Loki your final thought for tonight you have another game to play now
11636107	11636847	What's that, Duke Nukem?
11637487	11638287	Actually, it's two games.
11639328	11640668	Duke Nukem and Shadow Warrior.
11640908	11641788	Alright, we'll work on it.
11642748	11646769	My final thought for tonight is I may just have to get that Grand Theft Auto 5 on sale.
11646809	11648089	I think Loki might have finally broke me.
11648109	11648449	We'll see.
11649149	11650329	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
11650389	11654730	It wouldn't let me buy you a fractal on my Steam app, so I have to do it when I get home.
11655490	11656090	Aw, shucks.
11656391	11657571	But you're worth the $7.
11658931	11660731	That's always... I love you more than Loki.
11660751	11662032	He only spent $3 on you.
11662052	11662232	I spent $7.
11662272	11662312	Hi.
11665854	11667275	Wait, what?
11667295	11667275	$3?
11667375	11668997	I have to spend $3 on me?
11669017	11671419	What are you talking about?
11671459	11671779	See?
11674001	11675662	I would have gotten you fractal if you didn't already have it.
11678685	11682087	Leave us reviews that are nice and sweet because we're cute.
11682368	11682808	That's right.
11683809	11686491	To paraphrase, we're OLR and we're pretty.
11687452	11687792	How's that?
11689260	11715369	all right well thank you guys again and Bobby too have a wonderful week Bobby is especially pretty all the VOG shows damn it we're all pretty and all your all the indie shows you listen to I mean there's there's lots of great ones out there I know a lot of you support various indie shows I know a lot of you listen to the shows over on all games they would love to have your support with Stitcher Reviews as well I know a lot of you maybe like Gamer Tag Radio and some of these shows that have been on like ages like we have they all appreciate the support
11715549	11721916	By the way, I'm just throwing it out there, I'm actually planning on doing a Let's Draw series.
11722697	11723638	And what would that be?
11723678	11724379	You just draw?
11725300	11734411	Well, pretty much, I get votes for a character that someone wants to see me draw, and I will do one once a month and give it away as a freebie.
11735094	11735575	That'd be fun.
11736496	11736857	That'd be fun.
11736877	11737538	A little community.
11738540	11739041	Gather round.
11739221	11741184	So instead of a let's play, it's a let's draw.
11741765	11743548	And I don't have to worry about people breathing on my shit.
11743689	11746994	She's just like Bob Ross, but they're bitchy little clouds.
11749901	11750661	You know what?
11750821	11751942	Actually, you know what?
11752382	11754243	That came up in my oil painting class last week.
11754883	11756604	I was like, I can't be like Bob Ross.
11756664	11758325	My clouds are a little angrier than his.
11758785	11760666	And he's like, so are they fussy little clouds?
11760726	11761547	I'm like, yes, they are.
11761587	11762167	They're fussy.
11762787	11763127	All right.
