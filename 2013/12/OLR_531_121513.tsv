0	17200	We are nearly a week away from Christmas and there is plenty of cheer to go around.
17200	20920	Read Only Memories has hit its funding goal, SteamOS is here for system builders and hobbyists,
20920	24120	and large scale investments continue to roll in for the Oculus Rift.
24120	29920	This and more on the slightly sickly episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
30920	33920	Jason is way too happy in that intro tonight.
33920	38920	Hi everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38920	48920	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this December the 15th of 2013, episode number 531 of our program.
48920	54920	My name is Rob Roberts, here to join you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
54920	58920	with my co-host, say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
58920	59920	Hi.
59920	61920	How are you DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?
61920	62920	I'm okay.
62920	63920	You're okay?
63920	64920	Been better.
64920	66920	I think you and I are kind of in the same boat right now.
66920	68920	We are recovering from the plague.
68920	71920	Yes, we both have been a bit plagueish this past weekend.
71920	74920	Although I don't think it's the same plague, or maybe it is, I don't know.
74920	77920	But I don't think I gave you cooties.
77920	84920	I wasn't very very sick, but I've just been tired and worn down.
84920	90920	Well, as I think one of the emails we'll get into later, there's like a vog plague going around.
90920	93920	Because I think Jess from Understation Live has something that she gave to Alan.
93920	96920	Alan gave it to me, or maybe Alan gave it to Jess.
96920	98920	I think I got it from Becky.
98920	100920	Or from Dan getting it at work.
100920	104920	I think it's just in general the plague of living in Sacramento, California.
104920	110920	I think finally all that government nonsense is just making us all sick at the same time.
110920	116920	Or it's the cold, because you know us Californians are freaking out about the fact it's in the upper 20s.
116920	118920	I don't live in Alaska, people.
118920	122920	I've been sitting here rolling my eyes for a solid month.
122920	129920	Because seriously, this isn't cold and it's not humid, so you don't get cold with wet wind.
129920	131920	Well, here's a funny piece of that puzzle.
131920	136920	Who's not here tonight in studio, although he's been joining us on and off for the past month.
136920	138920	Not here tonight is Jason, our announcer.
138920	141920	He has the night off, and would you like to guess why he has the night off?
141920	142920	He has the plague.
142920	143920	He has the plague!
145920	152920	And he's from Colorado, and they get like negative 11 billion degrees in parts of Colorado where he's from.
152920	157920	So I don't think we can blame the harsh upper 20s of California on that.
157920	164920	But I'm fairly certain that the whole reason why I haven't been as sick as everybody else has been is because I practically live at the gym now.
165920	168920	Aren't you not supposed to work out when you're sick though? I thought that was like a big no-no.
168920	179920	No. I was reading lately that for people who spend regular, like at least two or three days at the gym a week, tend to have a stronger immune system.
179920	180920	Huh.
180920	186920	So if anything, that would explain why I've only been sick for like a day.
186920	191920	Yeah, but like Extrovert from Hoard House is a big old gym guy now, and he still gets sick a lot.
191920	192920	Huh.
192920	196920	Well, not a lot, but like as sick as often as I do.
196920	202920	I don't know, but I haven't gotten sick nearly as often as I used to before this became a regular thing, so.
202920	206920	Alright, well also say hello to Techmaster Loki is here tonight.
206920	207920	Hello.
207920	208920	How you doing, Loki?
208920	209920	I'm here.
209920	210920	Well, you don't have the plague.
210920	211920	No, I don't have the plague.
211920	215920	But if people were following along with previous editions of the show, you had wisdom teeth surgery this week.
215920	216920	Yeah, that was fun.
216920	217920	But you're here.
217920	219920	So you made a quick recovery.
219920	220920	Yeah.
220920	221920	What day did you have your wisdom teeth out?
221920	222920	Thursday.
222920	223920	Thursday.
223920	224920	So you're here.
224920	225920	That is only like three days later.
225920	226920	See, it's so different for different people.
226920	228920	Like some people are better like the next day.
228920	229920	Can I go right back to work?
229920	231920	Some people are out for like two weeks.
231920	232920	Yeah.
232920	233920	Two weeks.
233920	239920	Were you one of the ones that was out for like a frickin like two months or something?
239920	241920	Insane for months.
241920	242920	Oh my God.
242920	243920	What happened?
243920	245920	The holes never filled in on the bottom teeth.
245920	249920	So I basically had swelling and bruising for at least two of those months.
249920	250920	And then the pain.
250920	254920	I was on antibiotics for, I was on five different antibiotics.
254920	255920	Was that pre-OLR though?
255920	258920	Cause I don't remember that affecting the show.
258920	259920	Show's been on too long.
259920	260920	All right.
260920	261920	Sorry.
261920	262920	Low keys.
262920	263920	Around 2004.
263920	264920	Oh, then I guess we would have had the show.
264920	265920	Low keys moment.
265920	266920	Sorry.
266920	267920	No, I saw the swelling.
267920	269920	Um, and I can't really chew food.
269920	271920	I mean, I can sort of chew food.
271920	276920	Like I, I've been slowly getting into more solid stuff, you know, because before is smoothies
276920	279920	and soup and that's it.
279920	285920	So today I tried to do French fries from McDonald's and it sort of works.
285920	286920	It sort of works.
286920	287920	You're making it work, I guess.
287920	293920	Um, and then, um, yeah, so I, I'm not like pain medication.
293920	297920	I'm not really taking any unless, you know, sometimes during the night, just because it
297920	299920	makes the swell, the feeling of the swelling go down.
299920	303920	Like right now, like today, I don't feel as swollen, but it feels like it's all swollen
303920	304920	on the inside.
304920	308920	Like, cause sometimes like if I sleep on my side or something, I feel like I bite my cheek
308920	309920	or something.
309920	311920	So I kind of get that feeling right now.
311920	313920	I already had one of the stitches come out.
313920	316920	So I was like, no, sitting there talking.
316920	323920	I was like, there's a string here and it's like, okay, let's not get too detailed.
323920	326920	We want people to keep listening for when we get to the video game talk.
326920	329920	But, uh, I'm glad to see you're doing much better.
329920	332920	It looks like you're just, you're one of those people that made a quick recovery.
332920	333920	So good for you.
333920	338920	Apparently, uh, I metabolize, um, the, uh, anesthesia medicine really fast too.
338920	339920	Yeah.
339920	343920	I was going to say what happened to the, uh, Loki goes to the dentist or whatever video
343920	344920	that was going to be planned.
344920	345920	What happened?
345920	346920	I wasn't really out of it.
346920	352920	You know, I mean, I was a little like, um, tired and stuff like at first cause they,
352920	356920	they gave me Valium to take before I went there, which is good because like I have like
356920	362920	all sorts of unnecessary phobias about like all sorts of, you know, surgical could probably
362920	364920	haven't really done any of that stuff.
364920	368920	You know, I've never had any experience with like having surgery or being put under or,
368920	372920	um, you know, I don't really go to the doctor that often.
372920	375920	So, you know, I get a little nervous around needles and stuff.
375920	376920	I just don't like it.
376920	381920	And I know, I know that there's no real danger to it and it's just, you know, it still makes
381920	383920	me uneasy, but the Valium helped.
383920	386920	So they wouldn't let me stay awake and listen to them.
386920	390920	Um, well the Valium, yeah, the Valium helped and then they, uh, you know, they were going
390920	393920	to put in the IV and I just, I just didn't want to watch that cause I was like, ah, no
393920	394920	thanks.
394920	396920	So I closed my eyes and they gave me the oxygen and that was the last thing I remember.
396920	400920	But then, um, they, I did feel them doing stuff, but not necessarily anything painful.
400920	403920	I just felt them doing stuff in my mouth.
403920	405920	Like, I don't know, work.
405920	407920	Oh, I'm so glad that shit knocks me the hell out.
407920	412920	And then, then, then I woke up and you know, um, you know, they're all trying to like to
412920	414920	help me out, you know, help me sit down.
414920	415920	I'm like, no, I'm not dizzy.
415920	417920	I can walk just fine.
417920	419920	You know, that's not a problem.
419920	420920	So we went out to the car.
420920	425920	I'm like, I'm not really, I'm tired, but I'm not really dizzy or anything.
425920	427920	So yeah, unfortunately it wasn't loopy.
427920	431920	Nellie said I said weird things, but all of those were intentional weird things.
431920	432920	You always say weird things.
432920	435920	I was making bad jokes and that she's like, well, you said this joke.
435920	439920	I'm like, yeah, but I remember saying that and I meant that on purpose.
439920	442920	So, you know, that, that's not just me saying weird things.
442920	443920	All right.
443920	446920	Let me go to the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,
446920	449920	nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network,
449920	451920	vog network.com.
451920	454920	And if you are listening live on this Sunday night, come on down to the chat room,
454920	456920	live.vog network.com.
456920	460920	We often read comments from chat on the show because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
460920	466920	YYR starting us off tonight saying, come for the video game talk, stay for the gross medical drama.
466920	467920	Yes.
467920	468920	It's like an episode of VR.
468920	469920	It wasn't that bad.
469920	472920	Now, if I started talking about my hernia surgery that I had a few years ago.
472920	473920	Can we not?
473920	474920	Let's not.
474920	475920	Yeah, that was not fun.
475920	476920	All right.
476920	477920	Way worse than this.
477920	479920	I was awake through that.
479920	482920	Uh, SSG 100 Matt saying don't have rice.
482920	484920	I would say popcorn either.
484920	485920	Either way.
485920	489920	Well, yeah, I know I'm not chewing anything or it's pretty much all liquid stuff right now.
489920	490920	I ate a lot of pudding.
490920	494920	Stuff that I can eggs, you know, like I had eggs last night and those are dull.
494920	495920	They're like the best eggs ever.
495920	501920	Because, you know, after having just smoothies and, you know, tomato bits.
501920	502920	Do you like pudding?
502920	503920	No.
503920	507920	I was going to say, cause you can mix protein powder and my wife wanted me to have like,
507920	511920	she got, well, she meant to get rice pudding, but it ended up being tapioca.
511920	513920	I'm like, no, uh, awesome.
513920	517920	Unicorn is in our chat room saying, man, when I had all four wisdom teeth out, I agreed
517920	520920	to fill in for dinner theater the same night.
520920	521920	That's hardcore.
521920	524920	Cause like having to sing, I would assume dinner theater means you sing.
524920	530920	And like I just saw that vibration would, Oh, no, that's not fun.
530920	535920	I must, that must've been some like non-impacted easy peasy teeth coming out there.
535920	537920	Cause that's too much.
537920	541920	God, I was just thinking back to, I wanted to stay awake so I could watch.
541920	546920	I wanted them to put a mirror so I could watch, but they wouldn't let me, well, they wouldn't
546920	550920	let me watch my hand surgery either because it was too small, but they had to give me
550920	557920	laughing gas to make my, uh, uh, uh, my veins dilate so that they could get the IV in.
557920	562920	And that hand stayed bruised for like a week and a half.
562920	565920	Uh, so we're comments from a chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
565920	569920	Uh, Zebediah, the Messiah saying long time listener on iTunes first live show.
569920	570920	Well, welcome.
570920	571920	Welcome to the show.
571920	572920	Yeah.
572920	574920	We've been getting some new listeners, listeners lately, just thanks to it.
574920	578920	Well, I know he said he's a long time listener, but just thanks to, um, Stitcher.
578920	579920	He's awesome.
579920	580920	Unicorn very well.
580920	581920	Yeah.
581920	582920	I don't recognize the unicorn as well.
582920	583920	Who I don't recognize redundant.
583920	586920	I mean, all unicorns are pretty awesome.
587920	588920	The girl at Starbucks.
588920	592920	When I told her that I wanted a unicorn, when she asked if I wanted anything else, she drew
592920	594920	a unicorn farting rainbows on my cup.
594920	597920	I'm a little sticker that goes on my reusable cup.
597920	598920	I kept it.
598920	599920	It was great.
599920	600920	That's amazing.
600920	604920	Uh, and then dark Tetsuya in chat says, I was wondering if there was going to be a show
604920	607920	or not hearing everyone's sick and then Loki having, having his wisdom teeth out.
607920	612920	He, he, he, well, we had to be here because otherwise Zebediah, the Messiah would not
612920	613920	have had a live show to listen to.
613920	615920	And honestly, I didn't know how it, I mean, I didn't know how everyone.
615920	618920	I didn't know how everyone was saying, Oh, you know, you're going to be out for a while.
618920	619920	And I, I didn't know.
619920	623920	And, and hopefully nothing, I mean, so far I think everything's healing just fine.
623920	624920	Who knows?
624920	625920	Like a week from now.
625920	626920	And you know, Oh, sorry.
626920	627920	That just didn't quite heal.
627920	628920	Right.
628920	629920	Infection.
629920	630920	LOL.
630920	631920	I'm taking, I'm taking antibiotics.
631920	632920	Yeah.
632920	633920	So I'm good.
633920	635920	So they give you Keflex?
635920	636920	Uh, no.
636920	637920	Amoxicillin.
637920	642920	And, uh, then I have the, cause I can't swallow pills yet somehow.
643920	646920	Thank goodness that that volume was really small because like I couldn't drink water
646920	647920	with it.
647920	649920	Cause normally I just, I down a little water and salt and stuff.
649920	651920	Draggy lounge radio, everybody.
651920	653920	Hey, this is legal if you've been prescribed it.
653920	656920	But, uh, no, I have, uh, whatever.
656920	661920	It's like Tylenol with codeine or whatever, whatever that is.
661920	663920	They gave me Vicodin.
663920	666920	And then when those stopped working, they gave me horse pill Vicodin.
666920	671920	Like the one that's pure, pure hydrocodone and no other crap.
671920	674920	I just, when I had my gallbladder out, I slept for like a week straight.
674920	676920	That's just what I did.
676920	679920	I let the, you know what I did the first time I left the house after gallbladder surgery,
679920	680920	do you know what I went to do?
680920	683920	I have a gallbladder surgery like two days before Halloween.
683920	685920	Cause it was my ex's birthday.
685920	686920	Hilarious.
686920	691920	But, um, the first time I left the house after that was to go vote against Prop 8.
691920	694920	That was the first time I left the house after my gallbladder surgery.
694920	697920	It was a very worthy cause.
697920	699920	And you didn't vote absentee.
699920	700920	No, I never vote absentee.
700920	705920	I'm one of those people where I'm like, I think absentee for me, I realized tons of people vote absentee and that's cool.
705920	706920	At least you're voting.
706920	708920	For me, absentee takes the magic out of it.
708920	711920	Like I like to go in the little booth, click the, I don't know.
711920	713920	There's just something about that whole process.
713920	714920	I don't like people.
714920	720920	So I vote, I take my absentee, well the voting place is actually, I could walk there in five minutes.
720920	726920	So I fill out my absentee ballot at home with the internet in front of me and then I go take it and drop it off.
726920	727920	Oh, okay. That works.
727920	732920	So I've gone to the place, but I voted, but I voted in a very comfortable manner.
732920	733920	There you go. All right.
733920	739920	Uh, anyhow, uh, before we get into argument weeks and the things we've been playing this week, uh, some other topics here at the top of the show.
739920	744920	I don't have a whole lot in regards to kickoff topics, but we are entering the holiday period.
744920	748920	Um, although we here at OLR, as far as I know, we're going to be doing shows every Sunday.
748920	755920	We're not taking any time off for the holidays cause, um, everybody kind of lucks out this year with Christmas and New Year's being on what, Wednesdays?
755920	757920	I think Christmas and New Year's are both on Wednesday this year.
757920	762920	Like Sunday happens to be like the 29th and so, you know, whatever, we'll be here those days.
762920	766920	Um, none of us are traveling anywhere major, so we will be here through the holidays.
766920	777920	But since, you know, we're starting to kind of ramp up toward that season, I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to have a lot of time off where I'm doing nothing for like a week and a half at least.
777920	785920	Are you guys going to be catching up on any games or do you have any gaming plans through the holidays? Like a wish list of things you gotta get through in the next month?
785920	791920	Well, um, I still have to beat Skullgirls with everybody, which I just started it last night and beat it with Parasoul.
791920	793920	Well, not last night, but the other day.
793920	799920	And I do want to get at least up to a 35 and finish that stupid quest that I'm stuck on.
799920	800920	And that's in 14?
800920	801920	14, yeah.
801920	809920	But, um, I'm still trying to do the play a new game every week thing. So like this past one with Skullgirls, I'm going to start Deadpool next week.
809920	811920	So, there you go.
811920	813920	So that's my goal is just to do something different.
813920	815920	Your one new game a week. I like that.
815920	818920	And then we might, they'll be going to Washington later, so.
818920	821920	Oh, good luck.
821920	822920	Snowpocalypse.
822920	824920	Get lots of pictures of the snow on the way up there.
824920	827920	I will say thank you very much, Loki, before the show.
827920	831920	I hope you don't mind me saying this on the air, but Loki gave some Christmas presents out before the show.
831920	834920	I got a Steam gift card from Loki, and I believe Dark Soccer got one as well.
834920	835920	I did.
835920	838920	So, I'm armed and ready for the winter sale.
838920	841920	That is, when does that start, Loki? The winter sale for Steam?
841920	842920	Soon.
842920	846920	The winter sale was already done. Or is it the fall sale? I can't keep track of these sales.
846920	850920	Well, there's going to be a Christmas, New Year's sale. There always is, right?
850920	853920	But they don't call it Christmas. They call it holiday sale, right?
853920	857920	I think what we just saw was the winter sale, and now there will be the Christmas sale.
857920	859920	Ah, somebody in chat said a straight one.
859920	860920	The winter festival sale.
860920	861920	Live.vlogger.com.
861920	863920	It was the fall sale that they had, remember, because it was fall-spring.
863920	866920	Oh, yeah, it was fall-spring, because the thing was upside down, it said spring.
866920	867920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
867920	869920	So, I think the winter sale is coming right up.
869920	871920	Yay.
871920	872920	Go ahead.
872920	873920	No, just saying yay.
873920	874920	Oh, yay.
874920	875920	Yay, sales.
875920	878920	Loki, what about your projects? You love to start projects that you never finish.
878920	880920	How's that tablet going?
880920	885920	Actually, because I was actually thinking about that the other day, because I got some more stuff for that.
885920	894920	Originally, I was going to use, it's similar to how they did the cross-plane thing where they had individual circuit boards for each controller,
894920	899920	and it would have hooked up almost like a cartridge that you'd plug in.
899920	905920	So, I bought a Sonic 2 and Sonic & Knuckles Genesis thing.
905920	911920	I was going to rip the whole thing apart and use the connectors on there for that.
911920	916920	But, it's too damn small for what I want to do, and I'm going to need to add stuff to it later on.
916920	918920	So, I'm like, okay, that's not the way to go.
918920	926920	So, the way to go is actually buying this, it's like a USB thumb stick that you plug into your system.
926920	934920	I forget to call it now, but it basically allows you to use almost any controller on any system,
934920	943920	including a keyboard, mouse, on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PC, and it just works.
943920	945920	You can do that.
945920	950920	So, that simplifies wiring everything a lot more than it was before,
950920	954920	because now I don't have to worry about having to switch between multiple different systems.
954920	959920	I can just wire up one controller to it and then just run it through that,
959920	963920	and it would work on multiple systems instead of having to do all that stuff.
963920	966920	But, no, I'm still consciously working on all that stuff.
966920	971920	I just have to get the parts and figure out the feasibility and stuff to get it working.
971920	977920	Mainly right now is I'm trying to figure out how to make the actual case for all of it,
977920	981920	because that's going to be difficult since I've never done vacuum forming before,
981920	984920	and I had to design the case.
984920	987920	But before that, I was kind of distracted by,
987920	991920	okay, how am I going to get this so that I can wire up different controllers,
991920	994920	configurations, and stuff to one system?
994920	1000920	Well, now I don't do that anymore, so that makes it a lot easier in the design process.
1000920	1002920	But I'm still going to make it eventually.
1002920	1005920	So, what's your plan while you, because I knew you probably had a little time off of work.
1005920	1006920	What's your plan during that?
1006920	1008920	I don't have any time off of work.
1008920	1009920	Oh.
1009920	1011920	I mean, you know, like...
1011920	1012920	The days, but...
1012920	1014920	Head of days, okay.
1014920	1018920	I mean, I will have time off of work a few weeks after that, but...
1018920	1022920	Well, that's for the baby, so...
1022920	1025920	Well, actually, right now, I've been kind of...
1025920	1028920	What do I want to play and stuff?
1028920	1031920	Yeah, I had one game I wanted to really play,
1031920	1038920	and I was even so kindly after talking such shit about their DLC practices,
1038920	1044920	I still, despite all of that, supported them in their terrible DLC practices
1044920	1048920	by purchasing the Season Pass while it was on sale for Saints Row IV.
1048920	1051920	My reward for that was, fuck you, you're not...
1051920	1054920	Your save isn't going to fucking work anymore, you fucker.
1054920	1057920	So that was my thanks.
1057920	1062920	Thank you, Deep Silver Infelition, for wasting 40 fucking hours of my time,
1062920	1066920	you know, playing that game, and basically making my save completely useless.
1066920	1071920	And it's apparently a widespread problem, where not only is it not a save thing,
1071920	1077920	it's, like, people that bought the DLC, their game's just not fucking working anymore, so...
1077920	1078920	Oh, that's so frustrating.
1078920	1081920	It's just... thanks a lot, you know?
1081920	1084920	I was like, you know what, I just want to play something stupid today,
1084920	1086920	I just want to play, you know, some Saints Row.
1086920	1090920	After losing 40 hours in a game, how would you have the motivation to play again?
1090920	1093920	I'm gonna cheat like a motherfucker, is how I would do that.
1093920	1096920	But, see, that's the thing that was like, I don't even want to grind through,
1096920	1102920	even cheating like crazy to make it super easy so I can just get through all of it fast.
1102920	1103920	I don't even want to do that.
1103920	1108920	Why should I even put myself through the effort to, you know, play this game
1108920	1114920	when it's so obviously broken that I just... I can't... I can't do it.
1114920	1118920	And it's just, it's not gonna be worth it for these DLC missions, which, let me be honest,
1118920	1122920	they're probably about 30 minutes long each, if I'm lucky.
1122920	1125920	And so, I just don't know if I want to do it.
1125920	1129920	Yeah, I would like to go back and do it, but I wish my save would work just fine,
1129920	1134920	because, I don't know, it was fun, and it's definitely not mods,
1134920	1138920	because I've uninstalled... I deleted the whole game off my computer,
1138920	1142920	redownloaded everything, no mods are in there, it still fucking doesn't work,
1142920	1146920	so it's just something with their game, and it's disappointing.
1147920	1148920	Alright.
1148920	1153920	But, yeah, I don't know. I tried to figure something else to play.
1153920	1157920	For me, I kind of want to do the Jamie thing and try to do some new games,
1157920	1160920	although with Final Fantasy XIV getting a patch this week,
1160920	1162920	I'm obviously gonna dump a lot of my time into that,
1162920	1164920	but I'm trying not to spend my entire vacation,
1164920	1167920	because my work actually shuts down between Christmas and New Year's,
1167920	1172920	like, we have to take the time off, so I have lots of time off to do very little,
1172920	1175920	because, you know, my family doesn't do an awful lot on holidays.
1175920	1176920	You can hang out with me.
1176920	1178920	You can absolutely hang out and do stuff.
1178920	1179920	Go to Ikea every day.
1179920	1184920	Every day. Well, things should hopefully slow down a couple days after Christmas,
1184920	1188920	which is the period that I've got all this time and nothing to do.
1188920	1190920	I might finally crack and get the PlayStation 4,
1190920	1192920	because the finances are looking pretty good now,
1192920	1194920	so this might be the time I finally do that.
1194920	1197920	Well, you know, and I understand if you're still hesitant about picking up the PlayStation 4,
1197920	1198920	because there aren't a lot of games out there,
1198920	1203920	there is one game that's on current gen systems that would take up a good portion of your time.
1203920	1205920	Let me guess, does it start with Grand and end with a 5?
1205920	1207920	Yes, it does.
1207920	1211920	Actually, I was looking to see if it was on sale at Target when I was there the other day.
1211920	1212920	Amazon, $39.99.
1212920	1215920	Is it? I might jump on that. I really might jump on that.
1215920	1220920	We just put out the level creator this week, so I got working on that a little bit.
1220920	1224920	By the way, you know what I saw 5 of at Target in Roseville last night?
1224920	1225920	Xbox Ones.
1225920	1229920	Yeah, I saw it. There were plenty at the ones here in ESAC, too.
1229920	1231920	Dan's like, you want to get one? I'm like, no.
1231920	1233920	I'm kind of surprised.
1234920	1237920	I mean, you'll get one eventually.
1237920	1238920	Maybe.
1238920	1239920	It does have Killer Instinct.
1239920	1241920	Don't care.
1241920	1243920	I'm just saying, just saying.
1243920	1247920	It's just like, you know, there's not a lot I would play on it.
1247920	1251920	Even the PlayStation 4, either of the systems, there's not a lot I would really do.
1251920	1254920	We have no reason to look at either right now.
1254920	1256920	I really don't need a PlayStation 4 right now,
1256920	1261920	but knowing that after seeing the Final Fantasy XIV footage with the remote play,
1261920	1264920	I'm like, oh, God, at least I know a date now.
1264920	1265920	Exactly, exactly.
1265920	1271920	And, by the way, we just picked up Star Fox 3DS last night because we had coupons.
1271920	1273920	And Dan's all over that one.
1273920	1275920	So I was like, we've got plenty to play right now.
1275920	1277920	And Dan has a villager in Normandy.
1277920	1280920	You can go run by his tent now that Normandy is open.
1280920	1285920	The other big games I have to beat are Mario 3D World and Zelda Link Between Two Worlds
1285920	1290920	because I do love both those games a lot, probably in my best of the year, for sure.
1290920	1293920	I keep getting distracted with all these other games I'm trying to play, too,
1293920	1295920	so I definitely want to play those games and beat them.
1295920	1299920	Probably inevitably during the winter sale, BioShock Infinite will be on sale,
1299920	1301920	and I can finally play and beat that, and then I'm hoping I can get...
1301920	1305920	I think it's still on sale now. It's been, like, dirt cheap, like 10 bucks.
1305920	1307920	I bought mine ages ago for dirt cheap.
1307920	1313920	I'm hoping I can get The Last of Us and Beyond Two Souls from the rental company
1313920	1316920	over the holidays as well. That would be fantastic.
1316920	1319920	Or Zelda Wind Waker is on my list, too, because I've got to catch up with that.
1319920	1322920	We've actually got Ocarina for 3DS on our list. Dan and I do.
1322920	1327920	Wow. All right. Go into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1327920	1331920	Awesome Unicorn says, Resogun made the PS4 purchase worth it for me.
1331920	1334920	Yeah, that's one of the games I'm really eyeing. I definitely want to get that.
1334920	1338920	Fifth Dream said PlayStation 4 is worth it for Doki Doki Universe right now.
1338920	1340920	I don't know a lot about that game. I've heard of it.
1340920	1346920	YYR says, a friend who works at GameStop said today that PS4s were sold out in 10 minutes,
1346920	1350920	but Xbox Ones were in stock all day and didn't sell. He had no idea why.
1350920	1354920	Yeah, I'm hoping that if I do want to get a PlayStation 4, I can actually get one.
1354920	1356920	That would be really great.
1356920	1362920	Let's see. Raginator says, Skye, technically no one actually needs any games or system.
1362920	1368920	People need food, water, shelter, oxygen, etc. The question is, do you want the system?
1368920	1372920	You don't know my addiction, Raginator. I need it.
1372920	1375920	Valid smartass point that I would have made.
1375920	1377920	Intervention.
1377920	1382920	Anyhow, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week.
1382920	1385920	Not what we're looking forward to, but the things we've actually had our hands on this week.
1385920	1388920	I know I've had a few. I don't know about you guys.
1388920	1389920	Dark Sakura, starting us off.
1389920	1391920	I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now.
1391920	1393920	Yes you are. Why are you lying to the listeners? Don't lie to the listeners.
1393920	1395920	Normandy's open. Everybody come hang out.
1395920	1398920	I've been playing Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds.
1398920	1400920	Your hubby made a house in Normandy, right?
1400920	1403920	I made him a house in Normandy and he said he would play.
1403920	1406920	So I just got him started off and picked one.
1406920	1407920	So he has a shack.
1407920	1409920	Because I am the mayor. No, he has a tent.
1409920	1411920	Because you start off with a tent.
1411920	1415920	Because I am the mayor, I decided where his house was going to be because city planning.
1415920	1417920	And I gave him the rules.
1417920	1420920	Do not walk on the grass. You can walk on the path.
1420920	1422920	First thing he does is run through my lilies.
1422920	1424920	Fucker. I love him.
1424920	1426920	So yeah, I'm also playing-
1426920	1428920	I love that asshole.
1428920	1430920	I'm also playing Zelda.
1431920	1433920	I...
1435920	1437920	What else did I play?
1437920	1440920	Oh yeah, I played Skullgirls, which I really like.
1440920	1442920	And finally got to-
1442920	1446920	For some reason it doesn't work very well with the Capcom fighting controller.
1446920	1449920	But it works just fine with the regular Xbox 360 controller.
1449920	1451920	So that's what I'm using.
1452920	1455920	I loaded the Shiva and then I stopped playing it.
1455920	1458920	I've probably done five more playthroughs of the Stanley parable.
1458920	1460920	And I got the Portal ending.
1461920	1463920	Did you get that yet?
1463920	1465920	Oh, Rob just shook his head.
1465920	1469920	Yeah, basically, if you keep going through the wrong door-
1470920	1472920	Stanley parable is on my holiday list.
1472920	1475920	Because I own it. I bought it on the sale, but I haven't played it yet.
1475920	1480920	Okay. Well, just remember that going through the wrong door is an option.
1481920	1483920	Because I don't want to ruin it for you.
1483920	1485920	But I got dumped into Portal.
1486920	1488920	So that was pretty funny.
1488920	1490920	Oh, sorry.
1492920	1495920	What else did I play? Because I played other stuff too.
1498920	1500920	I tried to play more Bust-A-Move Universe.
1500920	1502920	It really is not very good.
1502920	1504920	I want to like it so much.
1504920	1507920	Because playing it on my phone is freaking awesome.
1507920	1510920	But playing it on the 3DS is not awesome.
1510920	1512920	It's nawesome.
1512920	1516920	Oh yeah, I've been playing a lot of Bejeweled on my phone.
1516920	1519920	Because that's my I-really-need-to-get-sleepy game.
1519920	1523920	And I like the music in that game. I can't help it.
1524920	1528920	It does kind of have New Agey, Philip Glass type of soundtrack to it.
1528920	1531920	Oh, I love Philip Glass. But the one on the phone?
1531920	1534920	It's like this epic type music.
1534920	1537920	It's kind of almost like...
1539920	1544920	Like whenever you see Ancient Mesopotamia, that type of music.
1544920	1547920	Like you're watching Ben-Hur or something.
1547920	1549920	Epic movie trailer of epicness?
1549920	1551920	Epic. It's epic.
1551920	1555920	And then I played more of...
1557920	1559920	Fractal.
1559920	1561920	Do you have Fractal?
1561920	1562920	No.
1562920	1564920	Fractal? And you're going to live with it.
1564920	1565920	Sweet.
1565920	1566920	Fractal is a great game.
1566920	1568920	Free games rule.
1570920	1572920	So I'm ruining one of your presents.
1572920	1574920	Do you have Fractal yet? You need to play Fractal.
1574920	1576920	Fractal? I probably do.
1576920	1581920	Fractal is like the best puzzle game in the universe.
1581920	1583920	It makes me super happy.
1583920	1585920	By the way, for anyone who just showed up, Normandy is open.
1585920	1587920	Okay, that's probably about it.
1587920	1590920	I didn't play any Final Fantasy this week. I played last week.
1590920	1592920	Which is how I got harassed for my name.
1595920	1599920	And everybody go on the VOG website and read my article.
1599920	1601920	Alright. There you go.
1601920	1603920	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1603920	1605920	I played Grand Theft Auto Online.
1605920	1612920	I ended up in a lobby with a modder or hacker or whatever you want to call them.
1612920	1616920	Whatever the case may be. I ended up level 40 and I have 13 million dollars now.
1616920	1618920	So that ain't bad.
1618920	1621920	And then I messed around with the content creator a little bit.
1621920	1626920	And tried to make a race and it turned out okay.
1626920	1628920	I guess you can stack objects.
1628920	1631920	There's like a trick where you can stack objects and make them float in the air.
1631920	1635920	Which is kind of what I wanted it to do in the first place.
1635920	1637920	But they made it so damn difficult to do that.
1637920	1640920	So I just kind of, you know, didn't mess with that part too much.
1640920	1642920	But there's some pretty neat stuff out there.
1642920	1649920	Unfortunately the one track that someone used as an example, like a floating racetrack, really sucked.
1649920	1651920	But I did play it.
1651920	1653920	There's some other ones.
1653920	1658920	It was where you're jumping over overpasses with cars with giant ramps.
1658920	1660920	That was kind of fun.
1660920	1663920	But I like the way it integrates in your game and stuff.
1663920	1667920	You see the waypoints on there but they're orange instead of blue.
1667920	1674920	And you can go on Social Club and basically bookmark any stuff that you like on there.
1674920	1678920	And it will show up in your game and you can play it and do all sorts of fun stuff.
1678920	1681920	So right now they have just the race and deathmatch creator.
1681920	1684920	But I guess more stuff is coming out later on.
1684920	1687920	And then what else did they play this week?
1687920	1691920	Oh! Some other strange stuff for a little unusual I guess for me.
1691920	1696920	So we were bored and I was trying to occupy Josh.
1696920	1699920	So I tried to get him to play Wii Sports.
1699920	1703920	That didn't work because he didn't want to play it and he wanted to watch me play it.
1703920	1705920	So I showed him bullying.
1705920	1707920	So I played a little Wii Sports this week.
1707920	1712920	And also played a little bit of Rabbids Go Home.
1712920	1717920	He thought that game was a little bit funnier because the Rabbids are being stupid and gathering trash.
1717920	1719920	He still didn't understand.
1719920	1721920	Those games are kind of made for kids too.
1721920	1722920	Yeah, exactly.
1722920	1727920	He didn't understand why the rabbit was screaming at people and their clothes were falling off and they were collecting clothes.
1727920	1733920	And he was worrying that their shopping cart was going to tip over because it was stacked really tall with all sorts of weird things.
1733920	1735920	So that was kind of funny.
1735920	1738920	He's like, you've got to be careful. Don't turn so fast.
1738920	1740920	So that was kind of funny.
1740920	1743920	And then what else did they play?
1743920	1748920	I think I played a little bit of Just Cause Multiplayer just getting in the last little bit of their beta.
1748920	1751920	That should be launching actually tomorrow.
1751920	1753920	So I'm looking forward to that.
1753920	1755920	I'll be coming out on Steam.
1755920	1757920	Worthwhile investment if I see so myself.
1757920	1761920	And then what else did I play?
1761920	1766920	A little Call of Duty I guess at work.
1766920	1768920	There's nothing really else to play there.
1768920	1772920	And that's pretty much it for right now.
1772920	1777920	But hopefully we'll get into some Saints Row.
1777920	1780920	I don't know if I want to go back.
1781920	1784920	It's sad.
1784920	1786920	You're just frustrated.
1786920	1788920	No seriously, it's sad.
1788920	1794920	Games like Saints Row 2 and stuff, I really like going back into those and playing them again and stuff.
1794920	1797920	But it's just the last couple of games they put out.
1797920	1801920	Like even Saints Row the Third, I think I played through that at least two or three times.
1801920	1803920	I just don't want to do it again.
1803920	1807920	I don't want to go through all the hassle because it's like, I've already seen that joke.
1807920	1809920	It's funny.
1810920	1819920	Maybe, maybe if a certain other host that was on this network would pick up a copy.
1819920	1822920	Then it might be worth it since I have to start from the beginning.
1822920	1825920	We could go through together and play through a co-op campaign.
1825920	1828920	Then I can also get those extra achievements I don't have yet.
1828920	1830920	Alright Travis Donovan, I hope you're listening.
1832920	1834920	Or Bobby.
1835920	1839920	Okay, my gaming week. I actually played a lot of random shit this week.
1839920	1841920	I powered on my 360.
1841920	1843920	I've never heard of a lot of random shit, Rob.
1843920	1845920	It's a new game. It's by Random Shit Co.
1847920	1851920	So I powered on my 360 this week, which is like the first time in like four months.
1851920	1853920	I turned it on and it had to do a...
1853920	1859920	I seriously think the last time I played my 360 was when the Mass Effect DLC came out.
1859920	1861920	Sure it wasn't Forza Horizon.
1862920	1866920	Maybe one of those. No, because the DLC was after the Forza Horizon stuff.
1866920	1870920	That was like, Forza Horizon-a-thon was back in like January, February.
1870920	1872920	And then what? When was the Citadel DLC out?
1872920	1874920	That was out over summer, right?
1874920	1875920	Yeah, I think so.
1875920	1876920	That was probably one of the last times.
1876920	1880920	I maybe turned it on once after that for Mass Effect multiplayer, but that was really it.
1880920	1884920	So I turned on my 360. It had to do a dashboard update.
1884920	1887920	What did they change? I didn't notice anything was different at all.
1887920	1888920	Jack shit.
1888920	1891920	I'm assuming the integration with Xbox One or something.
1891920	1892920	I don't remember.
1892920	1897920	Do your friends list expand on 360 now too? Because Xbox supports a thousand friends?
1897920	1901920	No, because all I see... I don't see what you're playing on Xbox One.
1901920	1905920	All I see is that you're on Xbox One. I don't see what they're doing.
1905920	1909920	Which is kind of weird because you could do that on PC.
1909920	1911920	I remember you used to see what people were playing on PC.
1911920	1913920	But no, they don't have that integrated there.
1913920	1915920	So no, I don't have more than 100 people.
1915920	1916920	Weird.
1916920	1921920	Well, I have 99 friends right now, so find my username if you want to be the 100th person.
1921920	1924920	You have 99 friends, but so-and-so ain't one.
1924920	1928920	Yeah, somebody dropped me this week. I don't know who because it won't tell me.
1928920	1930920	And BlackWolf confirms, no it doesn't.
1930920	1932920	Well, that sucks. I was hoping for that expansion, but oh well.
1932920	1935920	I admittedly haven't played a lot of 360.
1935920	1940920	I'm not being a hater. It's just nothing new I've really bought on 360 lately.
1940920	1944920	But I went back and visited some of my classics because I have a shit ton of downloads.
1944920	1947920	Especially from Xbox Live Arcade when Xbox first came out.
1947920	1949920	There's all that free stuff still, although...
1949920	1951920	Yeah, I've been checking some of that out.
1951920	1956920	But I went back and I played Gyruss, I played Tempest, I played Time Pilot.
1956920	1959920	I played all those old arcade games that were available.
1959920	1962920	Somehow I didn't play Game Room. I'm surprised I didn't.
1962920	1964920	But you know I love my classic games.
1964920	1965920	Played some...
1965920	1966920	And they love you.
1966920	1968920	As they should.
1968920	1972920	Played Spelunky, which came out on PlayStation.
1972920	1977920	It's been out on PlayStation Network. It came out on sale big time this week for like $375.
1977920	1982920	So even though I owned it on PC, I loved it well enough that I bought it again on PlayStation Network.
1982920	1984920	And I don't regret that decision because it's cross-play.
1984920	1987920	So I got it on PlayStation Network and my Vita.
1987920	1990920	So like anywhere in my life now I can have Spelunky.
1990920	1992920	Hold on, I'm gonna sneeze. Help.
1992920	1996920	Blessings be upon you for the mucus coming from your nose.
1996920	2000920	That was weird. It was one of those like, you're gonna sneeze, you're gonna sneeze. Just kidding.
2000920	2001920	Oh no!
2001920	2005920	Radio host's worst enemy. Sorry about that. And it's live. Nothing I can do about it.
2005920	2008920	No, imagine being in customer service and having that happen when you're trying to...
2008920	2010920	Oh, I'm sure. I was in customer service for seven years.
2010920	2016920	No, no, no. When you're trying to explain one's mortgage interest to them while they're yelling at you.
2016920	2020920	You see where this spot is right here. That's where...
2020920	2026920	Anyway, let's see. So I was playing Spelunky on now PlayStation Network.
2026920	2030920	Which, you know, literally it is the exact same game as it is on PCs. There's not a lot I can report on.
2030920	2034920	I did play it on Vita. It looks great, although it's so tiny and it's hard to read things.
2034920	2037920	But it worked well enough, so I'm cool with that.
2037920	2045920	And then I played one other game. And this game, I know I'm gonna get shit for my opinion.
2045920	2051920	Because I didn't really get it. And I have a lot of friends that are really, really into this game.
2051920	2056920	But I'm gonna be completely honest. I loved the presentation of this game.
2056920	2060920	I loved the way things looked, and I was really cracking up.
2060920	2067920	But when it came down to the game itself, I just really didn't have a lot of fun with the Wonderful 101 on Wii U.
2067920	2072920	And I know I'm gonna get crap for that, but it is what it is.
2072920	2076920	When I first started playing it, I was like, oh, this game is really funny.
2076920	2080920	And you kind of expect that from Platinum Games. Bayonetta was over-the-top hilariousness.
2080920	2083920	And there's a lot of that stuff in Wonderful 101 as well, so I was really into it.
2083920	2087920	But then when I actually played the game, I was kind of really getting frustrated with stuff.
2087920	2093920	So the gist of it is that you control an entire group of people.
2093920	2095920	And you pick up more people as you're running along.
2095920	2098920	And those people can be in different patterns.
2098920	2104920	They can be in a circle to turn your main guy into having a giant punching glove type of thing.
2104920	2106920	Or it can be a straight line for a sword.
2106920	2110920	And then at some point, when your group gets big enough, you can kind of have both going on at once.
2110920	2113920	And then you also draw lines to get from place to place.
2113920	2119920	But I was having a lot of problems with camera angles and not being able to see some places I wanted to go.
2119920	2124920	And there was this one part of the game where everybody gets under a giant football helmet.
2124920	2129920	Well, that football helmet was taking up the entirety of the screen. I couldn't even see where I was going.
2129920	2131920	So I had no idea what was going on.
2131920	2135920	So weird little quirks like that were just weird to me.
2135920	2142920	And again, trying to find some things I was supposed to be doing, it wasn't very intuitive.
2142920	2147920	And I guess the game is supposed to be very challenging, which I can respect it for that.
2147920	2155920	But it was a lot of slash slash like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game with this interesting mechanic.
2155920	2157920	So mash and slash and hope you get it right?
2157920	2160920	Yeah, kinda. That's what I felt when I was playing the game.
2160920	2165920	And so I feel kind of bad for razzing it because again, it had a great setup.
2165920	2171920	And everything was in this really cool package and the presentation was awesome and it looked great.
2171920	2176920	But yeah, the game itself, I just didn't really have fun with it.
2176920	2181920	So I don't know. I feel like this is one of those games that if I revisited it a month or two, maybe I'll enjoy it again.
2181920	2184920	But I didn't really care for it.
2184920	2185920	Well, you're entitled to your opinion.
2185920	2188920	I am. I am. And I know I'm going to get emails telling me I'm wrong.
2188920	2190920	Whatever. I thought it was Pikmin.
2190920	2191920	I mean, I don't know.
2191920	2195920	Not really.
2195920	2198920	Beautiful Pikmin.
2198920	2203920	No. No, it's not.
2203920	2207920	All right. So that was really it for my gaming week.
2207920	2211920	So I might try to get into that game like one more time.
2211920	2213920	Keep in mind, that was the game I played when I was sick.
2213920	2218920	So that could have been like kind of. But I'll try it one more time after I feel better.
2218920	2222920	And if I still don't care for it, I'm probably going to send that one on back and get something else.
2222920	2225920	But anyway, that's really it for my gaming week.
2225920	2228920	So anybody else?
2228920	2229920	Pizza.
2229920	2231920	Pizza. Pizza. You bringing me pizza?
2231920	2232920	No.
2232920	2236920	All right. Let's see. Some quick housekeeping.
2236920	2241920	By the way, you better bring out your DS so that I can get the last piece of the puzzle I need for the Rhythm Heaven puzzle.
2241920	2242920	Your thing has a street pass with me yet?
2242920	2243920	No.
2243920	2244920	Should have. Weird.
2244920	2245920	No.
2245920	2248920	Okay. So don't forget to follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2248920	2251920	And we're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and Google Plus.
2251920	2254920	Google.com slash plus Orange Launch Radio.
2254920	2257920	And as far as shows off over the next few weeks, we don't have any planned.
2257920	2260920	We will be here Sundays through the holidays.
2260920	2265920	So thank you for tuning in and being here for those shows.
2265920	2267920	A couple other quick things I should mention.
2267920	2269920	I haven't given this enough coverage on the show.
2269920	2275920	But I do want to make sure you guys know that over at vognetwork.com, there are monthly raffles we're doing now.
2275920	2280920	And every time you get a point on the site, you get an entry into the raffle.
2280920	2284920	But you do have to opt into the raffle. You're not just entered by default.
2284920	2290920	So you actually need to go to vognetwork.com, click on raffles, and actually enter the raffle.
2290920	2295920	This month, we are giving away a $20 gift card to an online source of your choice.
2295920	2303920	Meaning, I think the options are Xbox, Playstation, Steam, Wii U, and regular Wii.
2303920	2305920	Because those are still separate.
2305920	2309920	And then I know iTunes is in there too for people who don't even have any gaming consoles whatsoever.
2309920	2311920	Google Play probably.
2311920	2314920	I don't think Google Play was one of the options, but it probably should be.
2314920	2318920	I'm pretty sure if you came in and said, I really don't want any of those, I want Google Play.
2318920	2320920	I'm pretty sure we can make that happen for you.
2320920	2325920	So that is over at vognetwork.com slash raffle.
2325920	2327920	So check that out.
2327920	2332920	And you can either check in live, and you get five points just for listening to the show.
2332920	2336920	Or if you're listening on the podcast feed, there's a passphrase hidden somewhere in the show.
2336920	2338920	And you've probably heard it before.
2338920	2342920	Jason interrupts the show at some point and says, to register participation for this week's episode.
2342920	2344920	And then he gives you a little passphrase.
2344920	2347920	You go to vognetwork.com, you type that in the front page, and you will get your points.
2347920	2353920	But make sure you opt into the raffle if you want to win your $20 card that's not Google Play.
2353920	2355920	Just kidding, yeah.
2355920	2357920	Is Bobby in chat?
2357920	2359920	Bobby, can they have Google Play?
2359920	2362920	If they really want that more than anything, can they have Google Play?
2362920	2364920	I'll need to hear back from Bobby.
2364920	2367920	Vogmaster Bobby in just a minute here.
2367920	2370920	Other thing I want to promote.
2370920	2374920	It's award season for things that you like, movies and so forth.
2374920	2376920	And podcasts are no different.
2376920	2381920	Sadly, we didn't get nominated for the podcast awards, although I appreciate those of you guys that tried.
2381920	2383920	I know many of you were trying.
2383920	2385920	We didn't get nominated, sorry.
2385920	2387920	No, we did not get nominated for the podcast awards.
2387920	2389920	Lots of indie shows did, though, so I can't be mad.
2389920	2392920	And I have a pretty good feeling I know which one of them is going to win.
2392920	2395920	And if they do win it, they totally deserve it.
2395920	2399920	But I won't say, because I don't want to make a booby of myself.
2399920	2403920	But podcast awards, unfortunately, we're not there.
2403920	2407920	But we do have a chance to do the Stitcher Awards are going on right now.
2407920	2413920	And I love Stitcher, because Apple's podcast app right now, not so great.
2413920	2417920	But Stitcher is available not only on the iPhone platform, but on Android as well.
2417920	2420920	And it's a great way to listen to podcasts, because you can actually stream them.
2420920	2425920	So you don't have to download them all to your device, which is what turns a lot of people off from podcasting in the first place.
2425920	2428920	So Stitcher lets you stream them, which is great.
2428920	2437920	So check that out, Stitcher. We are actually eligible to be nominated and would appreciate your consideration in Best Game and Hobby Show.
2437920	2441920	I know some of the other VOG Network shows, like Bobby's going for games and hobbies as well.
2441920	2445920	So a lot of our listeners are kind of voting for us one day and voting for him another day, which is cool.
2445920	2453920	Understation Live, I think, is making a push for Most Original, which I can't think of a better title for that, for what they do over there.
2453920	2455920	I think that would be awesome if they got that.
2455920	2461920	So check that out again. That's part of Stitcher Radio at Stitcher.com, and we would appreciate your consideration during awards season.
2461920	2465920	Just, you know, the exposure helps grow our family.
2465920	2471920	As I say at the end of every show, we don't ask for your money. We don't ask for anything. Just help spread the word about Orchards Radio.
2471920	2472920	Just your soul.
2472920	2474920	Yeah, just your eternal soul.
2474920	2477920	All right, let's get into gaming news, though. That's what you really came here for.
2477920	2482920	You didn't come here to hear me promo all this stuff. You want to hear about gaming news and us riffing on it.
2482920	2492920	So, uh, Loki. Oh, wait, wait. Do we have a... Okay, BlackWolf has the determination. He was like, do Google Play cards exist?
2492920	2493920	They do.
2493920	2497920	Yeah, they do. I know I've seen them, too. And BlackWolf says, then I guess they can has.
2497920	2503920	So you heard it here first. Add it into the raffle this month. Google Play if you want. If you want.
2503920	2508920	All right. Now let's get into gaming news. Loki.
2508920	2518920	Ah, yes. So this week, everybody was up in arms because Content ID started going crazy. It became self-aware.
2518920	2525920	Now, it started flagging a ton of videos, even more so than normal.
2525920	2538920	And this is mainly because they opened it up from just, you know, non affiliated users.
2538920	2546920	And now they're also going after affiliated ones. And it just kind of went to illustrate how ridiculous this thing is.
2546920	2554920	It's, you know. First off, OK, YouTube made a comment on it, you know, and basically said, you know,
2554920	2559920	nothing illustrates the incredible growth and evolution of YouTube better than the enterprise class.
2559920	2562920	OK, this is all PR speak, by the way. You know, I just want to interrupt that.
2562920	2567920	As these networks grow, we will make we are making products and blah, blah, blah, blah.
2567920	2573920	See, here is part of our commitment to ensure that all enterprise partners can continue to thrive and be successful on YouTube.
2573920	2579920	OK, that's a whole bunch of bullshit. Basically, they said that, yes, those Content ID things that went out were not a mistake.
2579920	2590920	They are real. So there. And a lot of the problem is, you know, these videos, you know, for those not aware of the Content ID service,
2590920	2596920	you know, I'm sure you'll probably hear from anybody that you follow on YouTube or, you know, a ton of people, you know,
2596920	2603920	especially in the blogs recently, it's basically this way of automating the process of finding, you know,
2603920	2609920	videos out there that inflict or that have copyrighted material within them.
2609920	2615920	And so way it works is they have a 30 second sample or, you know, sample their song.
2615920	2624920	I think it's like the first 30 seconds and or video and can be submitted to the service and basically checks the waveforms
2624920	2629920	or whatever to see if they match this ID. I think of it like an MD5 tag or something like that.
2629920	2632920	It checks to make sure that, you know, this is what this is.
2632920	2639920	And then some of our just to give some perspective, some of our videos on the Orange Lounge Radio YouTube account have been flagged like old videos,
2639920	2647920	like things I don't really care about that were us playing DDR at E3 and like the song that's being played in DDR content matches.
2647920	2651920	So even though we're filming off it because, you know, E3 is loud and has that background noise.
2651920	2657920	And even though we're filming off the TV, it's still content matches, which, you know, whatever, like I really don't care.
2657920	2663920	I mean, to be fair, we were showing video of someone else's game, not trying to really monetize that or whatever,
2663920	2666920	but it's just kind of one of those eye roll things, you know?
2666920	2674920	Yeah. And the other thing, well, like I said, it's automated because before this content ID, you know, thing existed,
2675920	2684920	it would be up to the content holders, you know, like Warner Brothers or whoever, you know, to actually go and find those videos and flag them manually.
2684920	2689920	It was a very manual process and they bitched him on it saying, oh, look at all the stuff's getting, you know, copyrighted.
2689920	2695920	There's full episodes of shows and stuff on YouTube and this thing needs to be taken care of or else we're going to sue you.
2695920	2701920	And so that's where they came up with this content ID thing. And now it's being, you know, everyone's getting flagged.
2701920	2706920	The problem is, though, it's automated. It's not necessarily done by these, you know, companies.
2706920	2711920	So, for example, say, you know, Capcom or something like that.
2711920	2719920	Sure, they probably have their materials in there because they don't want someone infringing upon that stuff, but they may be OK with you putting that stuff in there.
2719920	2720920	Which Capcom is.
2720920	2728920	Yeah, which they are. And so there's still, you know, you have to go through the whole process of, you know, basically contesting it.
2728920	2742920	And then, you know, it gets sent to the Capcom or their legal team and they have to either say, you know, yes, we agree this is an error or no, this, you know, really is infringing and stuff.
2742920	2748920	And it can lead to, you know, copyright flags and, you know, a copyright strikes, three strikes.
2748920	2757920	And of course, you're you're gone. Your videos are gone. And, you know, you're not going to be using that YouTube account anymore to make money.
2757920	2762920	So it's just it's really annoying. And like I know, like personally, I've had to deal with some of this stuff.
2762920	2770920	Like I had a video that I made that was just some tutorial for Grand Theft Auto map editing and stuff.
2770920	2772920	And I didn't have any music in the background, but there's no audio there.
2772920	2777920	So, you know, YouTube said like, hey, here's some pre-approved tracks that you can use.
2777920	2783920	And so using their own service, I picked one of those tracks, got flagged from from that.
2783920	2791920	I'm like, dude, what the hell? I'm like, this is your this is music you said I can use in my video.
2791920	2795920	You know, and and now you're saying that, nope, sorry.
2795920	2798920	So I just removed the audio from that because obviously that wasn't the important part of it.
2798920	2802920	But it's just it's so ridiculous, you know, how how they've gone about it.
2802920	2810920	And, you know, there's stuff that, you know, people that don't even own the copyrights to, you know, are claiming like, as Bobby mentioned,
2810920	2820920	you know, four gamer movie is targeting stuff for Metro last night because they put one of their I guess let's play videos or something through this.
2820920	2822920	Somehow they were able to submit that as their own.
2822920	2828920	That I have a huge this is really irritates the piss out of me that what's going on with that,
2828920	2835920	where other people are putting in their content ID and it's not even stuff that they really own like that.
2835920	2838920	You that's what needs to be come down hard on these companies.
2838920	2845920	I said hard on these companies that put in these these content claims for things they don't really own that.
2845920	2848920	That needs to stop. And YouTube needs to come down hard and fast on that.
2848920	2857920	They won't. And that's that's going to be this is going to be a very interesting turning point because you've got a lot of very angry people about this,
2857920	2861920	because, you know, there's people that make their living off of YouTube videos.
2861920	2867920	And, you know, as much as you might want to say, get a real job or things like that, video editing is a bitch.
2867920	2871920	There's a reason I don't really like to put O.L.R. on video.
2871920	2879920	And I'm very thankful to our own VX Jason XV because he's the sucker that signed up and said, sure, I'll edit the videos to put it up on YouTube or whatever.
2879920	2883920	So prop. Thank you, Jason, because I ain't nobody got time for that.
2883920	2886920	As far as I'm concerned, I got other things I want to do.
2886920	2890920	It's such a pain at a video. So these people that do edit video, do work on it.
2890920	2898920	You know what? If you're going to watch it, I think the author can make like a tenth of a cent or whatever they get from the ad that shows in the beginning.
2898920	2908920	A lot of the people who have been making their money that way, like Classic Game Room, I think the Cinemassacre stuff, they've already left YouTube for other places.
2908920	2912920	And SF Debris, I think, went to Vimeo or this other one.
2912920	2914920	I don't think Vimeo allows gaming content.
2914920	2919920	No, not gaming. It's not for gaming. It was the guy who does the Star Trek and Doctor Who reviews.
2919920	2921920	Oh, probably.
2921920	2926920	I think he went to Vimeo or he went to one other one, but he's been off of YouTube for a while now.
2926920	2934920	It is. It's not good, though, because I mean, yeah, we're talking about the gaming portion of it, but I'm sure that not just gaming is affected by it.
2934920	2940920	Like a ton of people are affected by it, you know, especially just all sorts of content producers. And that's not good.
2940920	2946920	I mean, it's not sending him a good message. It's basically saying you're and it's bad enough that once they do, you know,
2947920	2952920	content ID you, whatever, they flag your video, you're not making revenue on that video anymore.
2952920	2957920	The person who ever flagged it, they just assume that whatever, they're making money off of it.
2957920	2964920	Like Nintendo does that. They're so generous and they, you know, they allow you to keep your video up so that they can make money off of it.
2964920	2965920	I mean, it's just ridiculous.
2965920	2970920	I monetize the videos on my channel, Rob Roberts Plays. I sign up for the monetization and whatever, you know,
2970920	2978920	and I realize it's kind of shaky ground with copyright because I am playing people, other people's games, but it's, they're old games.
2978920	2982920	I like to think I'm kind of educating and bringing light to it, whatever, but I really...
2982920	2985920	The amount of money, trust me, the amount of money is ridiculous.
2985920	2991920	That's the thing is I also don't have any disillusions that I'm going to make a shit ton of money off this and quit my job.
2991920	2994920	No, that's not going to happen and I'm totally fine with that.
2994920	3002920	But it's the kind of thing where I'm like, hey, if maybe one of the videos are to end up going viral and I can get money to like afford a new microphone, then great.
3002920	3007920	You know, we do spend money out of our own pockets to do this show and, and vog and all that.
3007920	3011920	Like I, if I told you how much I spend on my own money on this shit, you'd probably be surprised.
3011920	3014920	That's okay. I'm not trying to yell at anybody. That's my hobby.
3014920	3016920	A lot of people spend money on their hobbies.
3016920	3021920	Like if your hobby is a remote control car racing, you probably drop a lot of money into that.
3021920	3022920	Yes, Dan does.
3022920	3025920	Right. So that's what I'm saying. This is my hobby. I drop money into it. That's fine.
3025920	3026920	Same with pinball.
3026920	3032920	If I can recoup a little bit of that, then great. But you know, I realized too with the Let's Plays is a slippery slope.
3032920	3039920	I recently did a Let's Remember video for the Legend of Zelda on NES and you know that shit got flagged and I was just kind of one of those.
3039920	3046920	I just rolled my eyes and like, whatever, whatever. Fine. I don't care. Oh no. 30 cents lost. What am I going to do?
3046920	3053920	Well, one thing Bobby just linked in chat about Jonathan Blow being flagged for posting his own game.
3053920	3059920	Ooh, see that's really not good. That shows a real problem with the content ID matching system though.
3059920	3065920	And Game Guru pointed out that it was SF Debris went to Blip. I knew it was one of those other ones.
3065920	3067920	Those comments from live.vognetwork.com.
3067920	3071920	SHO 100 Matt saying there is going to be and should be a great exodus from YouTube.
3071920	3075920	People are going to start getting fed up with their flagging content policies.
3075920	3078920	If many of the big time YouTube channels started leaving, people will follow.
3078920	3083920	Let's be honest, YouTube is not a particularly difficult to steal technology.
3083920	3087920	I mean, there's tons of other companies that do the whole video embedding thing.
3087920	3092920	So it just kind of takes somebody stepping up and saying, yes, we welcome the gaming content.
3092920	3096920	A lot of people assuming that Twitch would jump on that real quick.
3096920	3101920	I mean, it would make sense because they already have ways that you can highlight and create like a video on demand thing.
3101920	3105920	They just don't have a way where you can upload your own videos that I know of.
3105920	3108920	Maybe you can and I just haven't really looked at that.
3108920	3115920	But needless to say, the focus on Twitch TV certainly isn't video on demand, but this is a huge opportunity for them.
3115920	3120920	If a competitor wanted to come in for Twitch TV, this is a great way to get their foot in the door.
3120920	3128920	But I think the problem is, and this is, I don't necessarily blame YouTube because it's not, it's not entirely their fault.
3128920	3134920	The reason why they're doing things that they're doing is because they're getting pressure from these other companies.
3134920	3139920	It's impossible to police everything that's on there, but they have to take these measures,
3139920	3145920	otherwise they leave themselves open up to a lawsuit from these companies.
3145920	3152920	Really, it's these companies, and don't get me wrong, I understand if I take a track from some CD or something
3152920	3158920	and blatantly put that up there in CD quality on YouTube, okay, that is infringing, that's ridiculous.
3158920	3161920	Which is weird because I see that shit all the time.
3161920	3162920	Yeah.
3162920	3166920	All the time, like I could go find a top 40 hit, bring up the YouTube and play it right now,
3166920	3170920	although now that I know we're putting on shows on YouTube I better not, because it'll get content.
3170920	3173920	But I see videos all the time.
3173920	3177920	Or full length movies. I watched the Flight of the Navigator the other day on YouTube.
3177920	3179920	Get the fuck out, that video's on YouTube?
3179920	3180920	Yes it is.
3180920	3181920	I love that movie.
3181920	3182920	That movie was awesome.
3182920	3185920	I watch documentaries all the time on YouTube.
3185920	3191920	Documentaries, sometimes they're so indie that people actually want to put that on YouTube just to get,
3191920	3195920	the monetization from YouTube is the only money they're gonna get otherwise.
3195920	3200920	There are full accounts that redistribute documentaries that may air overseas.
3200920	3206920	I watched that Extraordinary People series that airs on BBC.
3206920	3208920	That's how you get your Canada's Worst Driver as well.
3208920	3210920	I get my Canada's Worst Driver through YouTube as well.
3210920	3211920	I thought so.
3211920	3214920	Because that shows freaking addicting.
3214920	3218920	The problem is the system is just not real.
3218920	3227920	I think a good compromise, and even still this isn't perfect, it would be, let's say that a video comes out,
3227920	3230920	and let's just use an example of Nintendo.
3230920	3236920	Nintendo doesn't like the fact that you're using their video or something like that.
3236920	3238920	They're gonna monetize it or whatever.
3238920	3242920	I think that you should be able to split the revenue between what you've done and them.
3242920	3245920	I think that's a perfectly acceptable solution.
3245920	3250920	It gets a little complicated when you're talking music and stuff like that.
3250920	3254920	The music one is a real tricky slope though.
3254920	3259920	To some extent I think the artists licensed their music for that game.
3259920	3261920	They did not expect all this other stuff.
3261920	3266920	This is maybe how music needs to be licensed going forward,
3266920	3270920	but I can kind of see a little bit more where these games with these very AAA soundtracks,
3270920	3272920	it's a really slippery slope.
3272920	3275920	I kind of get that.
3275920	3280920	The other thing I was going to say is just because a lot of these companies,
3280920	3284920	and I don't necessarily like to say that, I don't blame those companies,
3284920	3287920	because a lot of them were like, dude, we don't know what's going on either.
3287920	3289920	We just started hearing about this.
3289920	3295920	Let us know if your video got flagged, or go ahead and object to it,
3295920	3301920	and we'll go ahead and flag it and let it go through and stuff.
3301920	3304920	We want you to have that stuff out there.
3304920	3314920	I was going to say, there are lists out there of actual games that people will let you play,
3314920	3316920	and they want you to play at different publishers.
3316920	3319920	A lot of them. There's lizard games.
3319920	3325920	There's a Wikia, for example, called let'splaylist.wikia.com,
3325920	3332920	and they even have a whole hashtag on Twitter, WhoLet'sPlay,
3332920	3338920	and those are all companies that will let you basically play their games,
3338920	3341920	and they're fine with you monetizing it, usually.
3341920	3347920	I think it will even let you know if they allow that and stuff.
3347920	3350920	For example, Minecraft, you can do that.
3350920	3356920	I was surprised, Rockstar, they're fine with you doing Grand Theft Auto,
3356920	3358920	and that kind of stuff in there.
3358920	3364920	There are companies out there, and I think if they're going to really...
3364920	3367920	I have a hard time believing that a lot of these gaming companies
3367920	3369920	are going to be really against people playing their videos,
3369920	3373920	but let's just say that there are some, then there's plenty of other alternatives.
3373920	3376920	Indies. Hey, Indies, I'm sure, would love some exposure.
3376920	3378920	Yeah. Well, yeah.
3378920	3381920	Extrovert's been doing some indie games on Twitch,
3381920	3383920	and he'll post about it on Twitter,
3383920	3386920	and the game creators and their relatives will retweet it.
3386920	3390920	It's kind of funny, because not tons of people are streaming the indie stuff,
3390920	3393920	so they get really excited when they have that exposure.
3393920	3397920	Codeman in chat, speaking of live streaming and so forth,
3397920	3399920	Codeman over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3400920	3402920	Twitch will eventually be in the same boat.
3402920	3405920	It's becoming more popular, and copyright laws will hit it.
3405920	3410920	It's sad that these things were made to share experiences with people,
3410920	3413920	and a few rotten apples screwed up for the bunch.
3413920	3414920	I think he meant to say it's sad.
3414920	3417920	But, yeah, it's interesting, though,
3417920	3419920	because now Twitch is in this really interesting boat where,
3419920	3423920	well, they are literally integrated into PlayStation 4 now,
3423920	3425920	and will be soon on Xbox One,
3425920	3427920	or at least they certainly have that channel already.
3427920	3432920	Nintendo, not so much, but Nintendo kind of does their own thing with online.
3432920	3435920	They're not looking to get Twitch on there anytime soon.
3435920	3438920	But because now that Twitch is integrated into the consoles,
3438920	3441920	it makes it a really weird thing.
3441920	3444920	I can't see gaming companies suddenly coming after Twitch
3444920	3447920	when Twitch is a part of the console.
3447920	3449920	It's kind of like if you put a game out on the PlayStation 4,
3449920	3451920	you know that that's going to happen.
3451920	3453920	Although, from my understanding is, of course,
3453920	3455920	game companies can turn it on and off,
3455920	3458920	but who's going to be that dick company to turn it off?
3460920	3464920	I don't think anybody's in a rush to be the first to have that notorious distinction
3464920	3467920	of you can't stream it on PlayStation 4.
3467920	3469920	Granted, I guess Playroom's already in that boat,
3469920	3471920	but for other reasons completely.
3473920	3476920	Anything else on the YouTube dramas you want to share, Loki?
3476920	3482920	No, I'm just more interested to see how this is going to fall out, I guess,
3482920	3485920	to see the reaction, because it only happened late last week,
3485920	3491920	and I don't know if we've really heard a lot from media publishers,
3491920	3496920	and YouTube's kind of said their thing,
3496920	3497920	but I don't know.
3497920	3500920	I'd be interested to see what steps are going to be taken
3500920	3504920	if people are planning on moving elsewhere, or what's going to happen.
3506920	3508920	Speaking of PlayStation 4 streaming, Black Wolf says,
3508920	3513920	I believe NBA 2K14 turns off the sound on the streams and captures,
3513920	3515920	so it's all silent, and that probably has to do with, you know,
3515920	3518920	because a game like that's got a huge soundtrack behind it.
3518920	3522920	Those EA sports games always do, so that wouldn't surprise me.
3522920	3524920	But you would think that they would still be able to do game audio,
3524920	3525920	like, you know, not necessarily.
3525920	3527920	Yeah, the game audio you think would be there.
3529920	3532920	All right, anyhow, going to another story.
3532920	3534920	Really, what they should do,
3534920	3537920	and this is the appropriate solution for NBA 2K14,
3537920	3543920	is to really just substitute all the music in the game with Space Jam.
3543920	3545920	Space Jam the entire time.
3545920	3547920	That would be the perfect solution.
3549920	3550920	I believe I can fly.
3550920	3551920	Huh?
3551920	3552920	I believe I can fly.
3554920	3555920	Amazing.
3557920	3559920	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Island Radio
3559920	3562920	at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase shell.
3563920	3568920	All right, moving on to some games that won't be showing up on PlayStation 4.
3568920	3570920	They probably won't show up anywhere.
3570920	3574920	It's 38 Studios, the big studio that went bankrupt.
3574920	3577920	You know, that was one that the baseball player guy owned,
3577920	3579920	and then they made Kingdoms of Amalur,
3579920	3582920	and then they shut down, and it left the state of Rhode Island
3582920	3586920	with a big debt because Rhode Island had helped them out.
3586920	3590920	Well, the auction happened this week to sell off some of their IPs
3590920	3593920	and the trademarks and so forth, and get this,
3593920	3599920	no buyer found for Project Copernicus, which was the MMO project they were working on,
3599920	3603920	no buyer found for the sequel rights to Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning.
3603920	3605920	Nobody wanted to buy it.
3605920	3606920	A dollar.
3606920	3609920	Yeah, well, I think you have to have what they call a reasonable price.
3609920	3610920	You have to be a reasonable...
3610920	3611920	Two dollars.
3612920	3614920	I think I've got some peanuts too.
3615920	3619920	38 Studios had their own social media platform called Helios.
3619920	3620920	No buyer.
3621920	3623920	Intellectual property rights for Catan.
3623920	3624920	No buyer.
3624920	3626920	And the big huge game engine.
3626920	3627920	No buyer.
3627920	3629920	Did they sell anything?
3629920	3630920	Yes, they did.
3630920	3635920	They sold a lot that included Rise of Nations and Rise of Legends,
3635920	3638920	those games and the associated intellectual properties,
3638920	3642920	and then the other one that they sold was for the big huge games trademark itself,
3642920	3645920	which is kind of a catchy name for a game studio, so...
3645920	3646920	Catan would have been fun.
3646920	3647920	Yeah, kind of.
3647920	3648920	I like Catan.
3648920	3649920	They already had Catan on...
3649920	3650920	Yeah, I know. They did it.
3651920	3652920	It was for the rights for that.
3652920	3653920	Yeah.
3654920	3657920	But anyway, apparently there were, I guess,
3657920	3660920	five parties that were actually participating in the auction,
3660920	3662920	but over 20 parties had expressed interest.
3662920	3667920	Anyhow, what did sell went for $320,000,
3667920	3669920	which might not sound too bad,
3669920	3675920	but apparently Rhode Island, the debt they owe Rhode Island, 100 million.
3675920	3679920	So that's practically pennies on the debt that they actually owe.
3679920	3680920	Ouch.
3680920	3684920	Apparently the state will continue to negotiate with interested parties
3684920	3688920	to try to sell that which was unsold thus far.
3688920	3689920	Yikes.
3689920	3693920	Maybe the state of Rhode Island could turn into big huge games.
3693920	3695920	You know, just...
3695920	3697920	Hire everyone in the state?
3697920	3698920	Big island games.
3698920	3699920	Why not?
3699920	3701920	Big island? Big? Really?
3701920	3702920	Yeah.
3702920	3704920	Is it really an island?
3704920	3705920	Not really.
3705920	3706920	No.
3706920	3708920	And its name wasn't really Rhode Island either.
3708920	3711920	Rhode Island's short for its full name, which is...
3711920	3714920	Oh god, I'm gonna make myself look stupid.
3714920	3715920	Rocky Rhode Island.
3715920	3719920	No, it's Rhode Island and something plantations.
3721920	3724920	That's okay. How about we just move on?
3724920	3727920	No, because I don't want to look stupid here on OLR from not knowing my...
3727920	3728920	You're just going on Wikipedia.
3728920	3731920	I'm from California, alright?
3731920	3733920	That's okay. I don't know what the crap it means.
3733920	3736920	The state of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.
3736920	3738920	That's the full name of the state.
3738920	3742920	I bet people in Rhode Island don't even know what the fuck that is.
3742920	3746920	It's written on their official seal that's on the floor of the Capitol.
3746920	3747920	Okay.
3747920	3751920	At least I knew it was not just Rhode Island. Give me half credit.
3751920	3752920	Okay.
3752920	3753920	Alright.
3753920	3757920	That seal would probably go for more than $320,000.
3757920	3761920	They could probably just sell the state.
3761920	3765920	They're gonna have to sell the state to get out of debt for that game?
3765920	3768920	Yep. They're gonna have to get a triple mortgage on their state.
3768920	3771920	Oh god, this just in. Rhode Island is now a part of New Jersey.
3771920	3777920	Ah! I don't think that's too fat low. Sorry, love you New Jersey.
3777920	3779920	Kidding! She's kidding people.
3779920	3780920	Kidding.
3780920	3781920	Alright.
3781920	3782920	So how about terrorism?
3782920	3784920	The state of Rhode Island and New Jersey Plantations.
3784920	3785920	How about terrorism?
3785920	3786920	Alright, how about it?
3786920	3790920	Well, the NSA has a new bestie. You know who it is?
3790920	3791920	Hmm.
3791920	3792920	Wow.
3792920	3800920	The NSA is going on World of Warcraft and other online games to look for terrorists.
3800920	3804920	Because this is America and we're afraid of terrorists. I guess.
3804920	3809920	It's not just American agencies as well. It's British agencies too.
3809920	3815920	So apparently it's this whole Anglo-Saxon descent stupidity thing. I don't know.
3815920	3823920	So the NSA and the government communications headquarters in the UK have been monitoring activity
3823920	3829920	and harvesting data from World of Warcraft and Second Life and apparently some other games
3829920	3837920	that they're trying to see if they're, I guess, a terrorist or trying to fish for information through MMOs
3837920	3841920	just by posing as a regular player.
3842920	3845920	I think that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of in my life.
3845920	3849920	I think that our tax money could be spent on better things.
3849920	3855920	And I want to know if they worked out anything with Blizzard to actually set that up or any of these other ones.
3855920	3857920	No, I think Blizzard came out and said they didn't know.
3857920	3858920	Yeah.
3861920	3868920	First of all, I want to know why they think the average MMO player is going to be in on top secret government stuff.
3868920	3876920	I mean, maybe they'll find someone who works at a, I don't know, a base or something that happens to play World of Warcraft
3876920	3879920	that has some clearance. Ooh, maybe that's what they're thinking.
3880920	3891920	It just seems to me that they are really just picking where, you know, anything that they can.
3891920	3900920	But they said that basically where they got the legal ability to do that was because of a 1981 executive order signed by Ronald Reagan.
3900920	3904920	You know, not only did he ruin our economy, he also did that too.
3904920	3907920	That gave it authority to collect the data.
3907920	3912920	So privacy groups are basically, you know, stepping in and what.
3912920	3917920	He was a real forward thinker, he's all, and the ability to spy on World of Warcraft.
3917920	3920920	I don't know what World of Warcraft is, but someday this will mean something.
3922920	3929920	At any rate, and I'm just going to read this line in this article here from Computer World.
3929920	3934920	In one document from around that time, the NSA talked about how it was able to gather information on user accounts,
3934920	3939920	characters, and guilds related to known Islamic extremist groups by monitoring World of Warcraft.
3939920	3940920	Really?
3942920	3943920	Really?
3944920	3945920	I can't.
3945920	3946920	I can't.
3966920	3969920	Well said, sir, well said.
3969920	3972920	I just, well here's the thing, I think part of this is overblown.
3972920	3973920	Or mam, or mam.
3973920	3975920	I think part of this is overblown.
3975920	3983920	I'm going to be honest, I think part of this is overblown because I don't think the NSA was necessarily paying a whole bunch of people to sit around in cubicles and play World of Warcraft all day.
3983920	3985920	I don't think that was quite what they were doing.
3985920	3986920	Dream job.
3986920	3987920	I know, right?
3987920	3988920	Were they trying to like hack into it?
3988920	3989920	Possibly.
3989920	3992920	I think that's probably more what was going on in our gold farms.
3992920	3998920	Well they said they were taking data feeds and whatnot, and you know, user logs.
3998920	4010920	At the same time, it wouldn't be out of the question that they would have people who are actually trying to communicate with groups that were flagged with a certain name.
4010920	4014920	And don't hear me out here just because I'm saying it's not as bad as you think.
4014920	4017920	I'm not saying it's appropriate because I kind of don't agree.
4017920	4019920	Because it's like, well, what good did it do?
4019920	4021920	What did we stop?
4021920	4025920	And you know there's those people out there that are like, lol, let's do a controversial name for our guild.
4025920	4026920	Yeah.
4026920	4028920	We are, you know, Pony Jihad or something.
4028920	4030920	Yeah, there's tons of trolls.
4030920	4035920	It's like if they were, you know, spying on Xbox Live, man, everybody's a terrorist on there.
4035920	4036920	Here's the thing though.
4036920	4038920	There's a difference between terrorist and asshole.
4038920	4043920	We've heard of people that have committed hideous crimes that happen to be World of Warcraft players.
4043920	4045920	It's an unfortunate coincidence.
4045920	4051920	And I believe, I really hope I'm not misspeaking here, but I mean there's unfortunately so many crappy people in the world.
4051920	4057920	But I believe one of them recently was that horrible, horrible guy who did the stuff with the Sandy Hook Elementary and all that, right?
4057920	4059920	I believe he was a WoW player.
4059920	4065920	So the police went to Blizzard and subpoenaed every chat transcript that guy ever had.
4065920	4069920	Because obviously the big question people want to know is, why the fuck did he do that?
4069920	4073920	That question is like not being answered.
4073920	4078920	And not even the Warcraft transcripts, assumably, that they subpoenaed were able to answer that question.
4078920	4084920	But my point is that, you know, they're able to get that information when they need it, when the police has it or whatever.
4084920	4089920	But as far as prevention stuff goes, we're not seeing that anything was prevented.
4089920	4093920	And I'm pretty sure his chat log would be like, LFR sucks.
4093920	4095920	It's probably not very interesting.
4095920	4096920	Dot's running out.
4096920	4099920	This tank sucks.
4099920	4100920	He'll please.
4100920	4101920	He'll please, yeah, thank you.
4101920	4104920	But, um, yeah, it's just, ugh.
4104920	4107920	But, I don't know where I was going.
4107920	4110920	The whole thing's just...
4110920	4112920	I like what Dungeon Buster just said.
4112920	4115920	It's no longer the Cold War, but we're still fighting things as if it were.
4115920	4116920	Ooh.
4116920	4117920	Very well said.
4117920	4126920	Well, I don't know, not to be overly political too, but you also heard about Putin taking over the news sources and dissolving certain agencies.
4126920	4128920	We're looking at...
4129920	4131920	I remembered what it was I wanted to say.
4131920	4136920	One thing you should be aware of is that your conversations that you have in these MMOs, they're not private.
4136920	4138920	They are being tracked.
4138920	4144920	And if something ever happened to you or you did something, they will get the records and look at every chat you've had.
4144920	4148920	And that could be, you know, whether you were cybering with somebody or what.
4148920	4152920	I mean, the stuff you do when you put that information on a server, it's not private.
4152920	4155920	Email's not private, really, in that regard.
4155920	4158920	I mean, you could go and subpoena those companies, too, and so forth.
4158920	4160920	So, you know, just be aware.
4160920	4164920	If you think you're having these ultra-private conversations on these websites, you're not.
4164920	4165920	Nope.
4165920	4168920	So, all right.
4168920	4174920	However, I do have a resource for people who want to stay hidden on the internet.
4174920	4176920	And it's actually a Tumblr called We Are Hidden.
4176920	4182920	Well, you could also just take that plug that's in the back of your computer that attaches to the internet, and you can unplug it, and there you go.
4182920	4186920	I'm just saying, for people who are paranoid about that, there's a resource out there.
4186920	4188920	But if you're really paranoid... Wait, hold on.
4188920	4191920	Because if you're really paranoid about being on the internet, don't be on the internet.
4191920	4195920	I don't... I'm just saying. Do or don't.
4195920	4202920	But with the world we live in today, you really can't not be on the internet and participate in modern society.
4202920	4205920	Well, yeah, I know. But, you know, don't have a Facebook.
4205920	4210920	I know plenty of people that don't use Facebook or any of that stuff, you know, so... Anyway.
4210920	4213920	Facebook is its own can of worms.
4213920	4224920	Indeed. Did you hear that thing this week? I don't even know if it's true or not, but that Facebook actually can see, like, if you type a status and you delete it, they still track, like, what you were going to post.
4224920	4229920	Like, they were doing some type of weird, like, tracking thing behind the scenes. I swear I saw some article on that.
4229920	4231920	Mine's going to be a lot of me bitching about people.
4231920	4236920	Well, yeah, and I'm thinking, like, wow, mine's going to be really awful.
4236920	4241920	I write a lot of very angry things that I delete and don't post on Facebook. Like, it's, like, a good little event.
4241920	4243920	So I need to go back to LiveJournal if that's the case.
4243920	4249920	LiveJournal. Let's all go back to LiveJournal. LiveJournal's going to be like, what the hell are all these people? Oh, Facebook, right.
4249920	4257920	Bobby Blackwolf, our pal in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, sure, you can participate in modern society without the internet. Old people do it all the time.
4257920	4259920	Even my mom.
4259920	4260920	That's hardly modern society.
4260920	4263920	My mom's on Twitter, for God's sake.
4264920	4270920	Rob. I want to see what Ellen is tweeting about, Rob. How do I join the Twitters?
4271920	4272920	I love your mom.
4272920	4275920	Alright. Let's move on. Loki.
4275920	4276920	Alright.
4278920	4281920	So, let's see. Let's talk a little bit about...
4282920	4284920	I just lost... What happened here?
4284920	4286920	Something moved.
4286920	4287920	The NSA.
4287920	4288920	Damn you, NSA.
4288920	4294920	No, let's talk a little bit about SteamOS. That just came out. Well, at least they have the beta test out there.
4294920	4299920	And they also shipped out those 300 Steam machines.
4299920	4303920	Sadly not to my house. I am disappointed.
4303920	4309920	But, yes, you can actually check it out if you don't have a Steam machine to test that on.
4309920	4311920	You can download it now.
4311920	4314920	And, um, yeah.
4314920	4322920	Of course, one of the things about the SteamOS is they're not trying to be a replacement for your own OS that you have right now.
4322920	4327920	But it is a good, I guess, alternative for gaming or something.
4327920	4329920	But check it out.
4329920	4332920	And, um, they even have, uh...
4332920	4337920	Those Steam machines that they sent out are pretty sweet and they came in like a wooden crate and everything.
4337920	4340920	I'm so fucking disappointed that I didn't get one.
4341920	4344920	Yeah, I know. I was really sad I didn't get one either. But, yeah, it is what it is.
4344920	4349920	Um, have we heard anything about people that are actually using SteamOS?
4349920	4352920	Because I know it's out there, but I'm not hearing a lot of, like, reviews on it or anything.
4352920	4354920	Like, how it works or...
4354920	4355920	I haven't heard anything yet.
4355920	4360920	I guess a lot of people are just hesitant to use it because it's like, well, I'm not going to exactly overwrite Windows with SteamOS.
4360920	4363920	So if you don't have a second computer for it, then, you know, what can you do?
4363920	4369920	Well, not necessarily. Because I think you can multi-boot into that stuff and do it that way.
4370920	4376920	But I'm not really sure how. I haven't messed with Steam or I haven't messed with Linux in a long time.
4378920	4387920	Last time I tried to mess with Linux is when I heard that Linux would allow me to somehow mount the file system on some DDR disk.
4387920	4391920	I don't remember what it was. Something had to do with Dancer Evolution hacking that.
4391920	4392920	But, uh...
4393920	4394920	Yeah, that was that.
4395920	4396920	Um...
4396920	4402920	Alright. Well, I'm going to try to move on. For our live listeners, the podcasts only will hear this.
4402920	4405920	Our live stream just dropped completely. We can't connect to our streaming server.
4405920	4409920	So it's not even my internet because I still see IRC and everything and everybody's freaking out.
4409920	4411920	But I can't even connect to keep the show going.
4411920	4412920	The NSA shut us down.
4412920	4413920	Apparently they did.
4413920	4417920	Jamie, would you mind? We're going to flip the script a little bit. Would you go to your story next?
4417920	4418920	I suppose I could do such a thing.
4418920	4422920	While I try to fix what's going on here, even though I might be out of my control?
4422920	4432920	Because it's Firefly! Hello! Firefly Online is going to be a thing and it is launching in summer 2014 by developer QMX.
4432920	4439920	And it's going to be on iOS and Android, but they are going to be expanding onto PC and Mac and may include other platforms.
4439920	4443920	So there's not a lot of information out other than soon.
4443920	4451920	But basically it's going to be you get your ship, you get your crew, you have to keep them happy.
4451920	4456920	You have to, you know, trade, craft, collect, fly around the verse.
4456920	4461920	And you also have a free form flight simulator built into it.
4461920	4471920	And they're basically saying that it's going to be, you know, when you start off you're basically going to be kind of another version of the Firefly crew.
4471920	4477920	You play as a brown coat captain and then you get other factions through later DLC releases.
4477920	4484920	But it sounds kind of fun. I'm looking forward to it. I might play it because I love Firefly. It's the Joss.
4484920	4491920	This is really cool news for those that were, because you know obviously that show had a huge cult to it.
4491920	4494920	And people want to see it come back and they want to see, you know, what's...
4494920	4495920	The comic's coming out too.
4495920	4496920	Yeah.
4496920	4497920	That's based after the movie.
4497920	4500920	But I mean what a nice way to kind of at least continue the story.
4500920	4502920	Because we all know like the show can't come back.
4502920	4505920	All those actors are on to new things. It's not going to happen.
4505920	4508920	Wasn't Marina Bakarin like super pregnant right now?
4508920	4509920	Uh huh.
4509920	4510920	I think she's super pregnant right now.
4510920	4511920	I think so, yeah.
4511920	4512920	Although her hair grew back.
4512920	4513920	Oh.
4513920	4515920	She had long hair in the last picture of herself.
4515920	4520920	But I think this is a great way for people to, you know, at least continue that.
4520920	4524920	It's weird to me that an MMO for Firefly didn't happen sooner.
4524920	4529920	I'm just wondering how well it's going to work on a phone, you know.
4530920	4534920	I mean I suppose it would be okay, but I mean just the managing your assets that way.
4534920	4537920	Maybe it would be easier on an iPad or a tablet.
4537920	4539920	Perhaps.
4539920	4541920	But I mean I'm definitely interested in it.
4541920	4542920	You know there's a...
4542920	4546920	For people who are Firefly fans...
4546920	4551920	Why you're nothing but Firefly pieces of pudding sitting on a plate.
4551920	4553920	You're custard.
4553920	4558920	No, but for people who are really into, you know, doing things in that universe.
4558920	4564920	There actually is a tabletop game that I want to say, well, the former White Wolf put out.
4564920	4568920	Because I think it's the same type of gameplay system as Werewolf and Vampire.
4568920	4569920	Those ones.
4569920	4576920	And like I said, there's a comic going to be coming out that's based on the Fallout after the Serenity movie.
4576920	4581920	So it seems that that universe is getting a lot of love lately.
4582920	4591920	Well, you think the fact that the Avengers is doing well and all that helps kind of bump up Whedon's properties?
4591920	4595920	It's Joss. People who love Joss love Joss regardless.
4595920	4602920	And for the record, I was never a big Buffy fan and I didn't like Angel until its last season because that was when the writers stopped giving a fuck.
4602920	4604920	That was when we had the Puppet Time episode.
4604920	4612920	But I loved Firefly. I didn't watch Dollhouse. But I've liked Joss' writing when he wrote for Astonishing X-Men.
4612920	4619920	That's probably the most I've enjoyed any X-Men title since the Dark Phoenix stuff when I was a little kid.
4619920	4625920	Our stream did come back for the live listeners. Welcome back. Apparently it was not our fault. I don't know what's up with that.
4625920	4629920	But anyway, going to some comments in our chat room, SSG100Matt says,
4629920	4634920	This still seems like an April Fool's joke. Is it a joke?
4634920	4639920	Well, it's not April. And they've been talking about it for a month or so, right?
4639920	4645920	So, because they put up the announcement a little while back, but they have a trailer up now.
4645920	4649920	Alright. Well, moving on. This is pretty cool. We talked about this on Hoard House a little bit this week.
4649920	4656920	But a new gaming network is launching. It's online. It's called ESGN, not to be confused with the ESPN.
4656920	4662920	But it's ESGN, the Esports Global Network. It will be a 24-hour web-based broadcast channel.
4662920	4665920	So it's not something you're going to find on traditional television.
4665920	4675920	But seeing as a lot of this competitive sports watching and so forth was born out of Twitch TV and those sorts of live streamings and online,
4675920	4677920	it makes sense that this is a logical next step.
4677920	4683920	Esports, of course, is a lot of the head-to-head combat. You see some of the big games that support this right now.
4683920	4687920	League of Legends, Dota 2. Of course, those MOBAs are huge for this.
4687920	4693920	Starcraft 2, World of Warcraft Arena. You see a lot of this being Esports.
4693920	4697920	And we've talked a little bit about this on my other show, Hoard House, as well.
4697920	4701920	You're seeing now people are getting visas to come into the US for sport.
4701920	4708920	We just had a guy for Starcraft 2 got a visa to come in on that game this week to play that. So that's pretty cool.
4709920	4717920	Anyhow, ESGN will be launching at ESGN.com and ESGNTV.com is the video site for its dedicated 24-hour channel.
4717920	4722920	Again, it is not something that's planned to be on standard television, quote-unquote.
4722920	4728920	But what is standard TV anymore in the world of Netflix and Hulu and YouTube and all that?
4728920	4731920	So this is going to be a very interesting experiment. Good luck to them.
4731920	4736920	And, you know, I know we don't talk a lot about Starcraft 2 and League of Legends on this show,
4736920	4742920	but if y'all need three fun and fabulous commentators on a Sunday night, we might be available.
4742920	4746920	Just say if the money's right. If the money's right.
4746920	4753920	All joking aside, let's get to the release dates. Travel the world and check out what's coming out in a gaming store near you.
4753920	4755920	Probably not a lot, right, Loki?
4755920	4756920	Or not a thing.
4756920	4757920	Not a thing, huh?
4757920	4760920	Not a thing. We are done for the year.
4761920	4762920	In the U.S., right?
4762920	4763920	In the U.S.
4763920	4768920	I mean, aside from, you know, digital stuff obviously coming out, but nothing at retail.
4768920	4772920	All right, well, let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.
4772920	4779920	And I think the story is a little different over there because they have time for more video games before their Christmas cakes.
4779920	4785920	So on the PlayStation 3 this week, Banfuse Rock Legends comes out, as well as Dragon Dragoon.
4785920	4791920	That's a 10th anniversary box collection there, and Dragon Dragoon 3 comes out as well.
4791920	4798920	A brand new DualShock controller in crystal color comes out, as well as FIFA 14 World Class Soccer Bonus Edition.
4798920	4802920	And Shin Gondomusou comes out this week as well.
4802920	4805920	And there's still some heavy hitters in Japan the rest of the year.
4805920	4814920	The day after Christmas, Boxing Day, if you will, for Canada, in Japan they're getting Final Fantasy X and X-2's remasters are out on December 26th.
4814920	4816920	So just barely making it this year.
4816920	4819920	So still plenty to come over there.
4819920	4825920	On the Xbox 360, Banfuse Rock Legends is there as well, as well as Shooting Love Collection.
4825920	4831920	And going over to the Vita on the PlayStation Vita this week, Amnesia V Edition.
4831920	4835920	Is that the same Amnesia that is the scary game that we have here?
4835920	4836920	I don't think it is.
4836920	4837920	It is not.
4837920	4841920	This is more based off an anime, I believe, with a lot of cards.
4841920	4843920	Looks like this guy plays cards or something.
4843920	4845920	Where did all my cards go? Where did these come from? I don't know.
4845920	4846920	I forgot.
4846920	4847920	Because I have Amnesia.
4849920	4851920	There's a crap ton on the Vita this week.
4851920	4853920	Dead or Alive 5 gets a price reduction.
4853920	4857920	Diabolic Lovers Limited V Edition comes out this week.
4857920	4863920	Geki Johan Mahou Shoujo Madoka, that's Magica the Battle Pentagram, comes out this week.
4863920	4868920	That's a big anime series that half my friends on Tumblr are losing their shit over.
4868920	4869920	Okay.
4869920	4873920	Hakoyuki Kuyokaroku comes out this week.
4873920	4876920	Injustice gets its Vita release in Japan this week.
4876920	4879920	Kudwafter, didn't we talk about this before?
4879920	4880920	Kudwafter!
4880920	4884920	Kudwafter has a design skin or something like that, like a Vita skin.
4884920	4889920	But there's also the converted edition of Kudwafter comes out this week.
4889920	4895920	Which I know we make it sound really hardcore, but it looks like this nice little Japanese girl who's having tea.
4895920	4897920	And she's actually making tea in this shot, I don't know.
4898920	4900920	But the game is called Kudwafter.
4903920	4905920	Let's see, what else is on the Vita this week?
4905920	4907920	See, Rama says fuck yes, Madoka.
4907920	4910920	Shin Gondom Musou comes out this week on the Vita as well.
4910920	4911920	Yay, Gondom.
4911920	4913920	Busy, busy week on the Vita.
4913920	4917920	On the Wii U, nothing, sorry.
4917920	4922920	On the Nintendo 3DS, however, High School D x D,
4923920	4925920	My Little Cat comes out in Japan.
4925920	4928920	I have to see what, it's a kitty game, I have to see what this is.
4928920	4930920	Oh my god, oh my god.
4930920	4932920	I am flailing, this looks amazing.
4932920	4933920	I need this in my life.
4933920	4935920	I need this in my life.
4935920	4938920	Someone get me a Japanese 3DS.
4938920	4940920	Okay, it looks like...
4940920	4942920	It's kitties in fancy hats.
4942920	4950920	It looks like real pictures of cats in like sailor suits, and pink hats, and like orange Halloween sweaters.
4950920	4952920	And they don't even look like they're gonna murder you.
4952920	4955920	So, this is what it comes to.
4955920	4958920	This is why Swap Note was removed.
4959920	4964920	I'm linking, I'm gonna link that to our chatters right now so they can take a look at that because...
4964920	4967920	And the chat room has harassed me into watching Madoka.
4967920	4969920	I need this in my life.
4969920	4975920	So that means that that's gonna be the next thing I have to marathon since I've marathoned all of Shingeki no Kyojin so far, and Claymore.
4975920	4977920	Who makes this game? MTO.
4977920	4979920	I don't recognize that name.
4979920	4983920	And I'm looking on the box art, everybody loves MTO.
4983920	4985920	Do they have a Twitter or something? Because I want this game.
4985920	4987920	We need to petition for that.
4987920	4991920	Like, oh my god, thank you for posting a picture of entertainment.
4991920	4995920	We need to harass them like we did for President Cat.
4997920	4999920	Which I still want to play that game too.
5000920	5003920	Oh my god, I want that in my life.
5004920	5007920	Koneko no album My Little Cat.
5007920	5009920	Koneko means kitten.
5009920	5013920	So it's like, I wonder if it's just like you take pictures of your own cat and then this program helps you...
5013920	5017920	Putting Midna in outfits! Oh my god, that's gonna be great!
5017920	5019920	I know, right?
5019920	5022920	Hey guys, I don't know what to do with you.
5022920	5026920	By the way, did you know that A Legend of Zelda The Link Between Worlds is still not out in Japan?
5026920	5028920	They will not be getting that until December 26th.
5028920	5030920	So consider yourself lucky here.
5030920	5032920	I need to put Midna in a frilly little dress.
5032920	5034920	She's gonna murder the shit out of me in my sleep.
5034920	5036920	She's not gonna drop this all night.
5036920	5038920	No, this is gonna be Midna.
5038920	5040920	Mom! Mom! Mom!
5040920	5042920	This sucks.
5042920	5044920	Cause that's how she talks.
5044920	5046920	Is AkumaJP helping us out here? What's this link he just gave us?
5046920	5048920	I don't know.
5048920	5050920	I know AkumaJP is over there and maybe can...
5052920	5054920	Oh my god!
5054920	5056920	They're ID pictures and you can make one look like a Bosozoku.
5058920	5060920	This is outstanding.
5060920	5062920	Okay, somebody get me a Japanese 3DS and this game.
5062920	5066920	I don't understand. This has to do with cats being adorable.
5066920	5068920	The internet would eat this shit up.
5068920	5070920	Look at that picture.
5070920	5072920	They're just up as Bosozoku. That's so awesome.
5072920	5074920	Horrible radio. I'm sorry you guys. I'm so sorry.
5074920	5082920	Maybe what I can do, I can beg Jason to maybe take some of these links and put some of the pictures in the YouTube.
5082920	5084920	And put them on our Tumblr.
5084920	5086920	Or just look it up again for yourself.
5086920	5088920	Look it up again for yourself.
5088920	5090920	Look it up for yourself, the game.
5090920	5092920	It's out there on your favorite import gaming website.
5092920	5094920	Alright, I gotta get through some PSP games though.
5094920	5098920	But you know what? Now I'm inspired to dress up Midna on her Tumblr.
5098920	5100920	Some PSP games.
5100920	5102920	As if the Vita wasn't enough.
5102920	5104920	You also have After School Colorful Step.
5104920	5106920	Undo Yubu comes out this week.
5106920	5108920	Lovely Quest Unlimited.
5108920	5112920	Nobunaga no Yabu Soku with the power up kit comes out this week.
5112920	5114920	That's a price reduction actually.
5114920	5120920	Kanojo no Ura Omote, Pure Sweet Heart comes out on the PSP this week.
5120920	5122920	Still kicking in Japan.
5122920	5124920	Dark Soccer, how about the UK?
5124920	5126920	I need the kitty game.
5126920	5128920	I know.
5128920	5130920	On the 18th we have Zen Pinball 2.
5130920	5134920	And the 19th, Colossatron, Massive World Threat.
5134920	5136920	That's a cool name, Colossatron.
5136920	5140920	And then on Wii U we have Knit Underground, K-N-Y-T-T.
5140920	5144920	And then Ridge Racer Slipstream for the Android, iPad, and iPhone.
5144920	5148920	And nothing else until...
5148920	5150920	Xmas.
5150920	5154920	Maybe we should call it X-tifermas and worship X-tifer.
5154920	5156920	We might do that on Hoard House this week.
5156920	5158920	We are having a Holi-gay special on Hoard House this week.
5158920	5160920	I wanna be on a Holi-gay special.
5160920	5162920	Alright.
5162920	5166920	Just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5166920	5168920	Which may or may not have to do with cats.
5168920	5172920	So Sony has patented a brand new...
5172920	5176920	Looks like a Move controller.
5176920	5182920	The difference being that instead of having an analog...
5182920	5186920	I don't know if it had an analog stick on that one side.
5186920	5190920	Anyways, the main difference is it's gonna have some sort of...
5190920	5192920	Looks like a touch screen on it.
5192920	5194920	Or not a touch screen, but a touch pad.
5194920	5202920	Kind of like how they have on the Vita and on the front of the PlayStation 4 controllers.
5202920	5204920	So maybe...
5204920	5206920	It makes sense if you think about it.
5206920	5216920	Because now they will need some sort of extra input to cover PlayStation 4 games that use the Move controller.
5216920	5218920	So maybe this is what this is about.
5218920	5220920	But...
5220920	5222920	Interesting I guess. I don't know.
5222920	5224920	I don't really...
5224920	5226920	Do a lot of games use the Move controller?
5226920	5232920	Are they gonna start bringing it back like how they did with Resistance and Killzone and stuff?
5232920	5236920	Where they have a giant fucking gun that looked ridiculous with the Move controllers in there?
5236920	5242920	Yeah, I kinda got the feeling they were trying to get rid of the Move.
5242920	5244920	Kinda shove that under the rug or something.
5244920	5246920	That's the impression I was getting.
5246920	5248920	Yeah, maybe not.
5248920	5250920	Interesting.
5250920	5252920	Alright.
5252920	5254920	Sorry, I'm trying to do a little research on this game company that makes this game.
5254920	5256920	I found their websites and I'm trying to see if they have a Twitter.
5256920	5258920	Apparently there's a Facebook.
5258920	5260920	I'm trying to find a Twitter.
5260920	5262920	There's a dog one too!
5262920	5264920	Oh my gosh.
5264920	5266920	But the kitty one's the best.
5266920	5268920	Okay, but this is good because now I can give out this URL so the podcast listeners can be like,
5268920	5270920	what the hell are they freaking out about?
5270920	5276920	So I'm gonna just totally give them a free plug here on the show because they make games to dress up your kitties and doggies.
5276920	5282920	mto-power.com. That's mto-power.com is the maker of these games.
5282920	5288920	And there's gotta be a way to send them a message and let them know we want these games in America.
5288920	5290920	I have hiccups now.
5290920	5292920	Did the cute kitties give you...
5292920	5294920	Excuse me, I didn't burp on the microphone!
5294920	5296920	Damn girl!
5296920	5298920	Burping is a good way to get rid of hiccups.
5298920	5300920	Damn!
5300920	5302920	I never, ever said I was ladylike.
5302920	5304920	I know, I know.
5304920	5306920	Fuck that.
5306920	5308920	Thank you Tigerclaw for linking it in the chatroom.
5308920	5310920	Okay, one more story for you guys.
5310920	5312920	This is one of those gaming good news stories.
5312920	5314920	Thank heavens.
5314920	5318920	Gaming exercise games, whether you love them or you're sick of hearing about them,
5318920	5320920	they do a lot of good for our community.
5320920	5326920	And a new study is out this week about Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus.
5326920	5332920	And of course Wii Fit Plus was available on the Nintendo Wii and now they have the newer version that's on the Wii U.
5332920	5338920	I believe the demo is done, but you can check that out too, it's on the Wii U.
5338920	5347920	Well, they say that Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus improves the lives of patients with Type 2 diabetes and helps control their blood sugar levels.
5347920	5355920	This is by BMC and Docrin Disorders who carried out the trial with 220 participants for a period of 12 weeks.
5355920	5360920	Half were asked to use Wii Fit Plus for half an hour a day and the second half were under routine care
5360920	5363920	and just got everything 12 weeks later.
5363920	5370920	Those that actually got the fitness game lost weight and improved their blood sugar levels.
5370920	5372920	Because guess what? They were doing exercise.
5372920	5378920	That's right, I know. That's kind of the thing. I kind of look at this and go, well duh, exercise leads to good things.
5378920	5384920	So of course this is what happened. When you give the people the stuff for free, I guess there's more incentive to play that.
5384920	5391920	But anyhow, experts noted that the daily physical activity increased, mental health and subjective well-being increased as well.
5391920	5399920	The number of patients suffering from depression decreased. However, interesting, a third of the patients dropped out of the trial,
5399920	5405920	meaning that people retaining the same level of enthusiasm over a sustained period of time was difficult.
5405920	5409920	According to Dr. Richard Elliott, who's with Diabetes UK,
5409920	5413920	physical activity in a healthy, balanced diet, along with taking doctor-prescribed medications if necessary,
5413920	5420920	can help people with type 2 diabetes to control their condition and minimize the risk of diabetes-related complications over time.
5420920	5424920	Computer games that promote a healthy lifestyle might be one way to achieve this,
5424920	5428920	but different forms of physical activity might work better for different people.
5428920	5433920	Further research will be needed to identify the long-term effects of such games compared to other approaches.
5433920	5436920	You know what? Whatever gets people motivated, right?
5436920	5442920	Well, I mean, the biggest thing is exercise and cutting out the sugar.
5442920	5446920	Because guess what diabetes is? Problem with insulin!
5446920	5452920	Although if you have type 1 diabetes, cutting out the extra sugar is not always good for you.
5452920	5459920	Alright, well, moving on to a more simple time when we weren't really able to interact with our games, unless it was dance aerobics.
5459920	5461920	When diabetes was Wilfred Brimley.
5461920	5462920	That's right.
5463920	5465920	The classic game of the week.
5465920	5469920	Every week, Dark Sakura goes into the Classic Gaming Vault and finds one game that she thinks,
5469920	5471920	hey, you guys should be playing this game.
5471920	5473920	Instead of eating all that candy.
5473920	5474920	Write the F now.
5474920	5478920	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5478920	5480920	Pole Position.
5480920	5482920	A very true classic indeed.
5482920	5486920	Yes. Basically, this arcade racer came out in 1982.
5487920	5490920	I love that intro music, because that's the only music in the game.
5490920	5493920	It's pretty much the only music in the game, the rest of it is just like squeaky noises.
5493920	5496920	I'll keep it really low in the background just in case.
5496920	5502920	It was manufactured by Atari, worldwide by Namco, in the US it was done by Atari.
5502920	5507920	It was actually the most popular coin-op game in 1983.
5507920	5511920	So it has an upright cabinet or an environmental cockpit cabinet,
5511920	5518920	which my Chuck E. Cheese's slash Showbiz Pizza in Mobile, Alabama had one forever.
5518920	5520920	And you know what? They still fucking have it.
5520920	5522920	The same one.
5522920	5524920	I'm just surprised it works.
5524920	5529920	So basically you have the accelerator, you have a brake pedal, and you have your wheel.
5529920	5535920	So it was the highest grossing arcade game in North America in 1983,
5535920	5543920	and it sold 21,000 machines for $61 million, equivalent to 2012's $140 million.
5543920	5545920	So just to put it in modern money.
5545920	5549920	The most successful racing game of its time, pretty much.
5549920	5552920	And it had a Saturday morning cartoon, which I watched the hell out of,
5552920	5554920	and have every episode of downloaded.
5554920	5556920	I also have a cool intro.
5559920	5565920	Pole Position I think was the big inspiration for most of the modern driving games that we have now.
5565920	5568920	So basically in the game you have a Formula One race car,
5568920	5573920	and you do a time trial lap to qualify for the Fuji race track.
5573920	5578920	And like we're saying, it didn't have a lot of money,
5578920	5585920	but it was the first track, the first video game that had a track based off of a real circuit.
5585920	5590920	So you did your qualifying lap, and then you could do the time trial, and then do the Grand Prix races.
5590920	5596920	And it was supposed to be the most realistic at its time game that came out.
5596920	5601920	Definitely didn't make me as sick as playing hard driving, because that game sucked.
5602920	5612920	And it also was in full color, and it had scaling sprites, including your race cars and your signs to give you perspective.
5612920	5620920	It was for the US release, Namco actually approached Bally Midway to either...
5620920	5626920	and said, okay, one of you can get one of these games.
5626920	5630920	And so Bally took Mappy, and Atari took Pole Position.
5631920	5636920	So basically it's been probably one of the most ported systems too.
5636920	5641920	It's been put out by Atari, Soft, and a lot of the home computers and consoles in the early 80s.
5641920	5647920	In the 90s there was Pole Position on PC that came back in Microsoft Return of Arcade.
5647920	5651920	It's been on Playstation, N64, and Dreamcast in the Namco Museum.
5651920	5656920	And it's also been on PS2, GameCube, GBA, and Xbox.
5656920	5660920	Fuji Speedway was renamed Namco Speedway in the Museum series.
5660920	5667920	And for the Plug and Play series that were part of the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade, it was called Blue Speedway.
5667920	5674920	And there's also a version to work with the Puffer Exercise Bite Controller.
5674920	5679920	And it has been put out on iPod back in the day.
5679920	5683920	And now we have IOS versions with Pole Position Remix.
5683920	5687920	And Pole Position 2, which was the sequel, has also been re-released as well.
5687920	5693920	Like I said, Pole Position 2 being the sequel, it came out in 1983.
5693920	5699920	And, let me see, I hate my iPad sometimes.
5699920	5712920	As far as that, there were also, a lot of people are saying that Final Lap is the unofficial Pole Position 3.
5712920	5720920	Which is sort of a racing RPG spin-off that came out on the TurboGrafx-16, also known as the PC Engine.
5720920	5723920	That version was called Final Lap Twin.
5723920	5727920	As I mentioned earlier, there was Pole Position Remix for iPhone.
5727920	5731920	And Pole Position 2, it had the courses for Pole Position 2 and a new course.
5731920	5737920	And there was also a cartoon of the same name, like I said, that I watched a bunch of times.
5737920	5740920	And Pole Position showed up in the movie Daryl.
5741920	5743920	Remember the movie Daryl?
5743920	5744920	I do.
5744920	5746920	The boy who was an android.
5746920	5748920	And he won a very high score in that game.
5748920	5750920	So yeah, Pole Position.
5750920	5755920	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Pole Position!
5755920	5758920	Available like 11 billion different places, seriously.
5758920	5759920	Seriously.
5759920	5762920	It was just because it was the most popular arcade game that year, I remember it, you remember it.
5762920	5763920	It's everywhere.
5763920	5764920	It's everywhere.
5764920	5767920	And you know what, we built our old main cabinet out of a Pole Position.
5767920	5768920	Nice. Very nice.
5768920	5770920	Shermie lived in it for a little while.
5770920	5772920	It was her cat condo, seriously.
5772920	5774920	That's a great use for a Pole Position machine.
5774920	5777920	My cat is, you know how fat Shermie was.
5777920	5778920	Yeah, of course.
5778920	5780920	I'm like, how the crap did she get in it?
5780920	5782920	She found the little door where the pedal was.
5782920	5788920	And she would just live, we had this Pole Position machine sitting in our apartment for a year it had to be.
5788920	5789920	Or at least half a year.
5789920	5791920	And Shermie lived in it.
5791920	5793920	Cats are amazing.
5793920	5795920	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break.
5795920	5798920	But don't go anywhere because when we come back there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5798920	5804920	More news, the Fuqua Question of the Week, your calls, and much more when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5810920	5813920	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5813920	5817920	We are live with episode number 531 already in progress for this.
5817920	5820920	December the 15th of 2013.
5820920	5822920	And you know since it is getting close to the end of the year here,
5822920	5826920	just a big Happy Holidays from all of us to all you guys out there.
5826920	5827920	Whatever it is you celebrate.
5827920	5829920	Maybe your celebration is already over.
5829920	5830920	Like dark sacras.
5830920	5831920	Hanukkah.
5831920	5834920	Well, I live in an interfaith home.
5834920	5836920	You are a Christmakah family.
5836920	5837920	Yes.
5837920	5838920	Which is fair.
5838920	5840920	So we had, we taught Julian about Hanukkah.
5840920	5842920	Because he had to study for school.
5842920	5845920	He's a really good little gambler now with the dreidel.
5845920	5846920	And he loves gelt.
5846920	5847920	Who doesn't?
5847920	5849920	And he was going around going,
5850920	5851920	Hanukkah.
5852920	5859920	And Becky and I determined that there's not a, we call it, we call it the phlegm sound.
5859920	5864920	Because there's no real translation for phlegm sound from Hebrew to English.
5864920	5865920	Other than,
5867920	5868920	Hanukkah.
5868920	5870920	Well, whatever it is you celebrate.
5870920	5872920	And Kwanzaa is the 26th.
5872920	5875920	Kwanzaa, Festivus, if you have a Festivus, pull up, enjoy it.
5875920	5876920	Yule.
5876920	5877920	Yule.
5877920	5878920	Dance naked around the tree.
5878920	5879920	Enjoy.
5879920	5884920	And just a big thank you from all of us to you guys who are such a great support for the show.
5884920	5886920	We've had a really good year this year.
5886920	5890920	And just additional exposure through, you know, Stitcher and podcasts.
5890920	5895920	And kind of, I know personally I've met a lot of other great podcasts through GamerX.
5895920	5897920	It was a great way to connect with a lot of other podcasters.
5897920	5898920	That was great.
5898920	5900920	And just so on.
5900920	5901920	So I just want to say thanks.
5901920	5902920	We've had a great year.
5902920	5905920	VOG has continued to grow, which has been great.
5905920	5908920	Brought on one or two new shows this year.
5908920	5909920	I can't remember.
5909920	5910920	I know Electric Sisterhood was this year.
5910920	5912920	I can't remember if there was one other one this year.
5912920	5913920	If that was last year.
5913920	5916920	But anyway, that hopefully continuing to grow into next year.
5916920	5918920	And just, yeah, lots of great things happening.
5918920	5920920	And you guys are all thanked for that.
5920920	5922920	Next year looks to be awesome as well.
5922920	5924920	Cannot wait for Dragon Con 2014.
5924920	5928920	Bobby and Travis Donovan done gone and got me addicted to Dragon Con.
5928920	5930920	So I'm counting down the days.
5930920	5932920	So I go back to Hotlanta for 2014.
5932920	5933920	It's going to be very exciting.
5933920	5936920	GamerX2 going to be amazing.
5936920	5939920	Like, I don't even think I can handle how amazing that weekend is going to be.
5939920	5941920	And so on.
5941920	5942920	Whatever else I end up doing.
5942920	5946920	I'm really hoping to get that New York City trip in this year that I've been needing to take for the past six years.
5946920	5947920	I'm going to go.
5947920	5948920	I just want to go to GamerX.
5948920	5950920	There's a great OLR family in New York City.
5950920	5952920	I'm sure we can make GamerX happen for you.
5952920	5953920	Okay.
5953920	5954920	That'll be easy.
5954920	5955920	All right.
5955920	5957920	So there we go.
5957920	5960920	We are going to get into some more gaming news.
5960920	5961920	Some rapid fire news.
5961920	5965920	I'm trying to buy Loki a little time because he's taking care of what he has to do for his wisdom teeth.
5965920	5966920	You all right?
5966920	5967920	Yeah.
5967920	5968920	All right.
5968920	5969920	So the rinse out was salted.
5969920	5970920	You salt water rinse.
5970920	5971920	Yep.
5971920	5972920	Don't want to get an infection.
5972920	5973920	That's fine.
5973920	5974920	I understand.
5974920	5976920	It's shoving all the salted French fries in your mouth isn't the same effect.
5976920	5977920	I really don't remember having to do that.
5977920	5978920	I do.
5978920	5979920	I remember that.
5979920	5982920	But I remember them giving me two different mouthwashes.
5982920	5984920	One of them was probably just salt water.
5984920	5985920	I don't know.
5985920	5987920	The other one had benzocaine in it.
5987920	5989920	So that's like washing my mouth out with orgyl.
5990920	5993920	And good Christmas shopping done in the break at the same time.
5993920	5995920	All right.
5995920	5997920	Let's get into some rapid fire news.
5997920	5998920	All right.
5998920	6002920	Let's talk a little bit about Fez.
6002920	6004920	Fez sold quite a few copies.
6004920	6008920	In fact, they're already surpassing 1 million copies.
6008920	6010920	So that's pretty awesome.
6010920	6013920	Especially for anybody in the indie scene.
6013920	6020920	And to celebrate that, I'm not sure if they're releasing on any more platforms here anytime soon.
6020920	6025920	Oh, it is on its way to Vita, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4.
6025920	6029920	So soon that'll be even more copies.
6029920	6031920	Elder Scrolls Online.
6031920	6034920	They finally announced the launch date of April 4th.
6034920	6037920	Man, that is going to be a busy month for MMOs.
6037920	6039920	I got to say.
6039920	6040920	PC.
6040920	6041920	Well, that's for PC and Mac.
6041920	6045920	Next-gen version not coming until June.
6045920	6050920	So if you're hoping to get on the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, you're going to be waiting a little bit longer.
6050920	6058920	And last but not least, this is kind of surprising because I remember this game from a while ago when Atari released it.
6059920	6061920	But Marc Echos getting up.
6061920	6064920	Content's under pressure.
6064920	6075920	The kind of weird graffiti slash futuristic government totalitarian game.
6075920	6079920	Originally, like I said, put out by Atari.
6080920	6088920	And now, though, the rights have actually been snatched up and it's been released onto Steam.
6088920	6090920	So you can check it out.
6090920	6093920	Thanks to Devolver Digital for publishing that.
6093920	6095920	And that's available on Steam.
6095920	6097920	And I think it's actually, at least it was on sale.
6097920	6102920	So yes, it's still on sale for 50% off.
6102920	6107920	So $7.49 if you want to check out the game if you may have missed it.
6108920	6112920	Alright, moving on in music gaming news that isn't so happy.
6112920	6117920	DJ Max Technica 2 and Technica 3 had this online thing called Platinum Crew.
6117920	6121920	Not to be confused with the Vita version of DJ Max Technica, which I know a lot of you have.
6121920	6123920	But the arcade versions had the Platinum Crew.
6123920	6125920	Unfortunately, that is shutting down.
6125920	6130920	It will no longer be available as of December 31st.
6130920	6131920	December 31st?
6131920	6132920	Hey, what about my flan?
6132920	6136920	That's what happens when you get 30 and first slammed together, you get thirst.
6136920	6140920	If you're thirsting for some DJ Max Technica 2, you better get that in before the end of the year.
6140920	6144920	Because unfortunately, it is all going down the very last day of the year.
6144920	6151920	And unfortunately, I think that whole, I kind of think there's, I get the impression there's no more Technica coming out at all.
6151920	6155920	Because I don't think the Vita version did too hot either, unfortunately.
6155920	6157920	Because it was a lot of fun.
6157920	6159920	I think that's kind of, kind of dying.
6159920	6160920	It's too bad.
6160920	6162920	Maybe Shane can set me straight because I know he's big on DJ Max.
6162920	6164920	Oh, he says in chat, he's actually there.
6164920	6166920	Shane will link on our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
6166920	6168920	It says, sadness to DJ Max.
6168920	6169920	All but dead now.
6169920	6171920	Yeah, pretty much, unfortunately.
6171920	6172920	Alright.
6172920	6175920	Anyhow, moving on to other things.
6175920	6179920	Another thing that's shutting down is Ghosts and Goblins Demon World.
6179920	6181920	Well, hold on.
6181920	6183920	This wasn't a Capcom project, it should be noted.
6183920	6187920	This was an unauthorized sequel from an indie developer, Phantasm Studios.
6187920	6191920	They were working on a Kickstarter and, probably not a big surprise,
6191920	6195920	it got pulled due to an intellectual property dispute.
6195920	6196920	And who closed it?
6196920	6200920	Capcom submitted a request on November 19th.
6200920	6203920	Phantasm was trying to get a developer's license for the game.
6203920	6206920	It would have reimagined a lot of the Ghosts and Goblins stuff.
6206920	6211920	If for whatever reason they did not get the rights, they were going to rename it King Arthur.
6211920	6213920	That's what they were just going to call it.
6213920	6218920	However, it got shut down because I guess Capcom didn't really,
6218920	6222920	it was one of those things where it sounded like they were, just getting the impression again,
6222920	6225920	they were going to do that after the fact, not before the fact.
6225920	6228920	And Capcom didn't want the name of the game being used like that.
6228920	6231920	So I can kind of see that.
6231920	6237920	In happier news, our track record for helping out Kickstarters improves this week
6237920	6242920	as read-only memories did get funded.
6242920	6245920	I got to admit, they were really close.
6245920	6247920	It was really down to the wire, but they did make it.
6247920	6251920	So congratulations to Matt Kahn, who was on the show a couple weeks ago,
6251920	6254920	as well as everybody over at MidBoss Games that helps him out
6254920	6256920	because they did reach beyond their goal.
6256920	6261920	They hit a final tally, 64,378.
6261920	6264920	And they were trying to make 62,000 to get matched by Ouya.
6264920	6267920	But the good news is now they will be matched by Ouya.
6267920	6269920	So yeah, that game is happening.
6269920	6273920	So we're hoping that will be playable at GamerX too.
6273920	6278920	So congrats to those guys over there at MidBoss Games. Woot.
6278920	6279920	Totally cool.
6279920	6280920	Look forward to playing.
6280920	6284920	Wow. Did you see the screen capture that Bob Coffee just put in chat?
6284920	6285920	I did not.
6285920	6287920	Oh, yours don't load, do they?
6287920	6289920	Yeah, what am I looking at here?
6289920	6291920	Hi, I'm Wayne Brady from Nintendo.
6291920	6293920	Wayne Brady. That's awesome.
6293920	6295920	That's funny. Okay.
6295920	6296920	Is that a gold shirt?
6296920	6297920	Yes, it is.
6297920	6298920	Wow. Okay.
6298920	6300920	Well, it's a gold letterbox.
6300920	6306920	Well, there is a Fable Anniversary set coming out on February 4th, 2014.
6306920	6310920	That's the 1080p HD version of the original Fable.
6310920	6312920	So actually it will be a good game.
6312920	6315920	And it will also have launch day weapons and outfits pack.
6315920	6321920	And you get a loot weapon that is supposed to be pretty awesome.
6321920	6328920	In other news, there is an officially licensed Mega Man board game that's on Kickstarter.
6328920	6334920	And they are seeking $70,000 by January 19th.
6334920	6338920	And it's already over $160,000.
6338920	6340920	So people really like Mega Man.
6340920	6345920	The core version is the 25th anniversary with 9 figures.
6345920	6347920	4 of which are Mega Man.
6347920	6349920	4 robot masters and 1 Dr. Wily.
6349920	6352920	And that's a $70 dollar packet.
6352920	6358920	And then for $140 you get a deluxe version that adds Time Man and Oil Man.
6358920	6364920	And 40 card player decks and individual robot master game boards and dozens of token pieces.
6364920	6366920	So good for them.
6366920	6374920	And another cool thing, and this is actually thanks to my hubby who gave me this bit of news while I was trying to work last night.
6374920	6381920	Ultra Street Fighter 4 is going to have online training and 3 versus 3 matches like King of Fighters.
6381920	6386920	So you can get your Street Fighter 4 on KOF style.
6386920	6397920	I am just looking forward to doing my final fight team of Andore, or Hugo, sorry, Poison, and...
6397920	6398920	Guy, right?
6398920	6399920	Yeah, Guy. I think Guy is in it, isn't he?
6399920	6400920	Yeah, Guy is in it.
6400920	6401920	Yeah, and Guy.
6401920	6402920	Because that's my team.
6402920	6404920	Hagar is in it too, isn't he?
6404920	6408920	I don't remember about Hagar, but I know Cody and Guy were in Super Street Fighter 4.
6408920	6413920	They were some of the characters added there because I love playing Guy because he was my guy in Final Fight.
6413920	6417920	Guy was my alpha person. It was him and Sakura were my alpha people.
6417920	6421920	I remember when they released Final Fight Guy on the NES. It was such a big ass deal.
6421920	6424920	And you know what I have? Final Fight Guy in the box.
6424920	6428920	Although, I'm sorry, not on NES, Super NES was Final Fight Guy.
6428920	6430920	It was a Blockbuster exclusive.
6430920	6433920	What's that other, god fuck.
6433920	6435920	Mighty Final Fight was the other one.
6435920	6437920	Mighty Final Fight was the Nintendo one.
6437920	6438920	It was the SD.
6438920	6439920	It was kind of shit, you guys.
6439920	6440920	It was.
6440920	6442920	It's one of those things where everybody's like, yeah, Mighty Final Fight!
6442920	6443920	And then when they play it, they're like, wow.
6443920	6445920	But it was fun. It was fun for being shit.
6445920	6446920	Yeah.
6446920	6451920	But I mean, I'd have to say that Final Fight Guy was always my...
6451920	6456920	I had a copy of it that I had borrowed from someone who stole it from Blockbuster.
6456920	6459920	Hey, as in Alabama, we're poor!
6459920	6460920	Classy.
6460920	6461920	Fuck.
6461920	6467920	And then I gave it back, and I moved out here with my friend's Chrono Trigger that he just let me keep.
6467920	6473920	And Dan and I looked into Final Fight Guy loose, and then we looked into the box separately.
6473920	6476920	So now we have Final Fight Guy in the box.
6476920	6479920	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vlognetwork.com says,
6479920	6482920	Let's just cut to the chase and do a Capcom versus SNK3 already.
6482920	6483920	Fuck yes.
6483920	6486920	Amen. Hands in the air. Hands in the air. Testify.
6486920	6487920	Preach it.
6487920	6489920	Preach. Preach.
6489920	6490920	Did I tell you...
6490920	6491920	This needs to happen.
6491920	6495920	By the way, one of the other games that we bought last night was Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
6495920	6496920	Oh, I'm sorry.
6496920	6499920	Well, we had to buy one, get one, and we couldn't find another freebie game.
6499920	6500920	Alright, well if you had nothing better to do...
6500920	6502920	We also got Metal Gear Rising.
6502920	6503920	Okay.
6503920	6505920	So we could play around as Pretty Boy.
6506920	6507920	Alright, is that it?
6507920	6508920	Yeah.
6508920	6511920	Alright, let's go to the Fookal Question of the Week.
6511920	6512920	Fookal.
6516920	6519920	Every week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities,
6519920	6522920	we ask a question and you guys answer it.
6522920	6523920	And you know what?
6523920	6526920	Because it is the holiday season and I'm feeling awfully charitable,
6526920	6528920	I think I'm going to read all the answers tonight,
6528920	6530920	of which there are an awful lot of them.
6530920	6531920	Yay, Rob.
6531920	6532920	So heads up, guys.
6532920	6533920	You can do it.
6533920	6534920	I can do it.
6534920	6535920	Cheerleader.
6535920	6536920	Alright, here we go.
6536920	6537920	How many answers are on Facebook?
6537920	6538920	Seventeen. We can do this.
6538920	6539920	Alright.
6540920	6541920	Here's the Fookal Question of the Week.
6541920	6546920	And, oh God, this was a moment in history on the internet.
6546920	6551920	The internet just exploded and the gifts were priceless.
6551920	6553920	Because I'm sure you've all heard by now,
6553920	6556920	the bombshell that was dropped on the music industry,
6556920	6558920	when Beyonce just released a new album.
6558920	6559920	But Jesus.
6559920	6561920	With no promotion or fanfare.
6561920	6564920	And the whole internet went to the Church of Jesus Christ
6564920	6567920	and was like, preach, honey.
6567920	6569920	And on top of that, it's good.
6569920	6571920	It is a great album.
6571920	6574920	And I think my favorite thing that came out of the whole thing
6574920	6578920	is that gift where Beyonce goes to the table
6578920	6582920	and she just swipes all the albums of Katy Perry and Gaga and Miley
6582920	6583920	and everything just right off the table.
6583920	6586920	Although I will say this quickly, tangent, sorry, apologies,
6586920	6591920	but I hate this shit where we keep pitting women against each other
6591920	6594920	and there's only one women diva.
6594920	6597920	Like look, Beyonce is queen.
6597920	6599920	We recognize that's fine.
6599920	6604920	But it doesn't mean that she has to be better than all these other women
6604920	6606920	who try just suck or garbage.
6606920	6607920	Yeah, like Justin Bieber.
6607920	6609920	Yeah, like Justin Bieber.
6609920	6610920	Stop picking on her.
6610920	6612920	Yes, exactly.
6612920	6614920	You're so awful.
6614920	6615920	But you know what?
6615920	6617920	VH1 had that whole divas thing for a while, remember?
6617920	6618920	Yes.
6618920	6619920	That was cool.
6619920	6622920	Remember when they would all come together at the end and sing
6622920	6625920	and they brought out Carol King at the end
6625920	6627920	and everyone tried to out diva Carol King
6627920	6629920	and you don't out diva Carol King.
6629920	6630920	I'm sorry.
6630920	6631920	On her song.
6631920	6632920	Although I understand.
6632920	6635920	Like Beyonce just fucking out diva'd them all.
6635920	6637920	She just walked into the room, dropped the mic and left.
6637920	6639920	Like I get it, but you know.
6639920	6640920	Because she's bejesus.
6640920	6644920	I think we should support all talented artists.
6644920	6647920	And I also just like that her album is called Beyonce.
6648920	6649920	Anyhow.
6649920	6651920	So all that aside.
6651920	6653920	Shane is blowing up in chat.
6653920	6654920	I'm so sick of her.
6654920	6656920	So, so sick.
6656920	6658920	And it's a fucking huge album.
6658920	6660920	I went back to check how many.
6660920	6661920	What she did though.
6661920	6662920	What she did was unprecedented.
6662920	6663920	400,000 copies sold.
6663920	6667920	That's like Gaga and Britney combined.
6667920	6669920	There's like not just all the music,
6669920	6672920	but she's got videos out for half the stuff on the album.
6672920	6673920	All of them.
6673920	6674920	Yeah, and that's on.
6674920	6675920	And they're good videos.
6675920	6676920	Anyway, look.
6676920	6677920	Moving on.
6677920	6678920	Sorry.
6678920	6679920	But here's the thing.
6679920	6681920	You're like, what the fuck does this have to do with gaming Rob?
6681920	6683920	Didn't Beyonce sue a video game company?
6683920	6685920	Yes, she did.
6685920	6687920	But here's the point.
6687920	6688920	The gaming community is.
6688920	6690920	This is no stranger to us.
6690920	6691920	Like we see this all the time, right?
6691920	6695920	They come out in E3 and say, Hey, if you want to get this today, you can.
6695920	6696920	Like what?
6696920	6697920	What are you?
6697920	6698920	Entertainment.
6698920	6699920	We need to stop all this woman on woman fighting.
6699920	6700920	We need woman on man fighting.
6700920	6703920	I'm going to see Beyonce take out Nickelback for good.
6703920	6707920	I think everybody wants to see Beyonce take out Nickelback for good.
6707920	6710920	I would like to see it like fricking.
6710920	6711920	I don't know.
6711920	6714920	Celine Dion can take out Nickelback for good for all I care.
6714920	6715920	All right.
6715920	6717920	Anyway, so the gaming industry is no surprises.
6717920	6718920	We see these.
6718920	6719920	It's out today.
6719920	6720920	Announcements a lot.
6720920	6723920	What if you could in the gaming community have one?
6723920	6729920	I said realistic stealth announcement because I didn't want people to be like hologram gaming out today.
6729920	6736920	Like, okay, if you could get a realistic stealth announcement this holiday season, what bombshell do you want to see drop this holiday season?
6736920	6737920	So here we go.
6737920	6743920	Coming up first from Jimmy B, who I think honestly, he got five likes on this post.
6743920	6745920	So I think he kind of has the winning answer here.
6745920	6752920	But Jimmy B over on Facebook says, Half-Life 3 pops up on Steam on Christmas morning.
6752920	6754920	Internet explodes.
6754920	6757920	We're praying, everybody.
6757920	6758920	Prayer circle.
6758920	6760920	Let's all form one.
6760920	6761920	Half-Life 3.
6761920	6763920	That would be the bombshell I'd like to see.
6763920	6764920	That would melt Steam.
6764920	6765920	That would melt the internet.
6765920	6766920	Are you kidding?
6766920	6768920	Which is ironic.
6768920	6769920	Steam melting.
6769920	6770920	All right.
6770920	6773920	Jeremy Jay, our buddy from Koopa Club.
6773920	6781920	Hey, Jeremy Jay says, I'd love to see Game Boy Advance games appear on the Wii U eShop all stealth-like.
6781920	6783920	Specifically Metroid Zero Mission.
6783920	6785920	But yeah, that's a good realistic prediction.
6786920	6788920	Nintendo making more money off of old games.
6788920	6789920	Absolutely.
6789920	6794920	Degenerate Johnny says, I want Rockstar to announce that Grand Theft Auto 5 is out now for the Wii U.
6794920	6797920	It's current gen, so making a port shouldn't be a problem.
6797920	6804920	Plus, you can use the touchpad screen to help navigate throughout the city as well as play around with the iFruit app while playing GTA 5.
6804920	6806920	Sorry, Loki, but I had to speak my mind.
6806920	6808920	Why did he have to apologize?
6808920	6811920	Would you be offended by Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Wii U, Loki?
6811920	6812920	No.
6812920	6813920	All right.
6813920	6814920	It would be kind of awesome, actually, with it.
6814920	6815920	He's right.
6815920	6816920	The whole integration with the app would be pretty cool.
6816920	6820920	For the record, back to the Beyonce versus Nickelback thing.
6820920	6823920	While I think Beyonce could take Nickelback, I think Rush could take Beyonce.
6825920	6827920	All they had to do was have Neil Peart drum on her head.
6829920	6831920	Anyhow, moving on.
6831920	6838920	Our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad, says, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 emulation on the new consoles.
6838920	6840920	Don't think that's going to happen, buddy.
6840920	6841920	Sorry.
6841920	6847920	Well, the PlayStation 3 would be a lot closer because of the Gaikai technology.
6847920	6848920	That's possible.
6848920	6849920	Xbox 360, I don't know.
6849920	6852920	I mean, Microsoft will do it, maybe, if they can.
6852920	6853920	We'll see.
6853920	6856920	Fabrice A. replies and says, easy.
6856920	6858920	Sega launches a new console.
6858920	6860920	Why not stick to the classics?
6861920	6870920	Robert K. said, the rumored to-be-finished Shenmue HD is released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in time for the in-game release.
6870920	6875920	In time for the in-game Christmas festivities because sailors and I need hope.
6877920	6881920	Robert K. taking a game of Lucky Hit on his gander there, so good luck.
6881920	6885920	Code Man says, I would like Nintendo to announce a new Mario Galaxy.
6885920	6888920	I literally went crazy when I played the game for the first time.
6888920	6890920	I think a lot of people would like to see a new Mario Galaxy.
6891920	6894920	Fifth Dream says, is Fallout 4 realistic enough?
6894920	6895920	Final Fantasy 15?
6895920	6896920	Probably not.
6896920	6902920	But it would be cool if Sony suddenly updated the PlayStation 4 with CD, MP3, and streaming media support.
6902920	6903920	A firmware update.
6903920	6904920	That could definitely happen.
6905920	6910920	Elliot B. says, I could ask for a new Metroid Prime or Guitaro Man, but I'll go with something a little more realistic.
6910920	6912920	Heists in GTA 5 Online.
6912920	6916920	Launching the online mode without a decent selection of co-op missions was very silly.
6916920	6918920	Even the fighter jet death matches are getting stale.
6918920	6920920	Rockstar, throw us a bone already.
6920920	6921920	You agree with Elliot?
6921920	6922920	Loki?
6922920	6923920	You want to see some heists?
6923920	6926920	Heists would be fun, but I don't think it's necessarily getting stale.
6926920	6931920	But now that they have all these content creator things, it'd be cool to do your own missions.
6931920	6933920	Or make custom game types and stuff.
6934920	6940920	Cial responds and says, Capcom releases a new Good Mega Man, or a new 2D Metroid from Nintendo.
6940920	6949920	Daniel T. says, the announcement of Virtual Console crossed by, followed by a One More Thing announcing the availability of, as Jeremy said,
6949920	6955920	select Game Boy Advance titles, or in my dreams, DS and GameCube titles would make me fanboy so hard.
6956920	6962920	John from Critical Myth, our pals over there, Mondays 4 o'clock Pacific on VoG, says,
6962920	6967920	Final Fantasy XI Free to Play on PS Vita, 24th December 2013.
6967920	6969920	I think Loki would like that very much as well.
6970920	6975920	Blood Drunk replies and says, Steam Holiday Sale Day 1, Half-Life 3 status available now.
6975920	6986920	Gaben moves forth and ascends to godhood as the father and savior of gaming and ends this holiday season console wars as PC becomes the definitive master race of this generation and the next.
6987920	6992920	I feel like that response should have been read to like, duh, duh, duh.
6992920	6994920	Or in the Howard Cosell voice.
6995920	6997920	Yes. But don't expect me to do that when I'm sick.
6998920	7000920	You all know my impressions are not very good.
7001920	7008920	Jennifer L. says, I would love the next generation of Pokemon to come out all stealthily. Kids around the world would panic.
7009920	7014920	I somehow, I don't think Pokemon games are capable of coming out without hype, but that would be really funny to see happen.
7015920	7024920	Raginator says, as totally unrealistic as it may be, I'd say that for the Steam Winter Sale, everything is completely and utterly free for a certain period within the sale.
7025920	7027920	It's a pipe dream, yeah, but one can dream, right?
7027920	7037920	Maybe a Valve game will be free. I mean, they did give away Portal at one point. You never know. There might be a Christmas gift, or like a Christmas reward for participating in the sale.
7038920	7042920	That happened before once too. I think that's how I got like Alien Swarm 2 or something like that. One of those games.
7043920	7049920	And lastly on Facebook, our pal Delvin from Video Game Realness, which is a really fun podcast out of Canadian.
7050920	7060920	Delvin replies and says, some kind of major Wii U release that none of us saw coming. Not Star Fox or Metroid, like something no one is expecting.
7061920	7063920	Spanish Inquisition the game.
7064920	7069920	Then we might have a bit more restored faith in Wii U and say they knew what they were doing all along.
7070920	7079920	Sadly, I think Wii U needs the fanfare to kind of get their investors rallied up a little more, but I'm going to hope. I'm going to form a prayer circle with you.
7080920	7084920	Because I would love to see that happen on Wii U as well. And shut them haters down. Shut them haters down.
7085920	7089920	Alright, a few comments from Google+. Redertainment says, price drop on everything.
7090920	7098920	Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, PS3, 360, games, accessories, everything reduced in price. Also, I'd like a pony.
7099920	7101920	Okay, Jamie. That was a very Jamie answer.
7102920	7109920	I was trying to reply something Ron said about PC will never become the master race for gaming. All games will be nerfed to console standards. Not quite so.
7110920	7112920	Because there are some people that refuse to leave Mac. Don't forget that.
7113920	7119920	Anyhow, as far as Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and all that goes, 2014. It will be a belated Christmas gift for entertainment. Belated.
7120920	7130920	ActDeft says, a secret Nintendo Direct this week. Before we sign off, we would like to gladly announce that we're releasing F-Zero Universe.
7131920	7138920	A new installment on the beloved F-Zero franchise with HD graphics, online play, and a new customization mode so you can change your machine however you like.
7139920	7145920	When's it going to be released, you asked? Right after this Nintendo Direct is over on the Wii U eShop and a retail version in January.
7146920	7147920	How's that for a bombshell announcement?
7147920	7151920	Well, I came. That's exactly what I'd like to hear.
7152920	7155920	Rob. Rob.
7156920	7161920	I came over to the computer to place my pre-order. That's what I meant. Nothing dirty.
7162920	7163920	You don't have to call your mom.
7164920	7173920	Sam H. Please don't. Sam H. says, Uncharted 4 available today. Colin M. says, Shenmue 3. Chalk another Shenmue answer up there.
7174920	7183920	And lastly but not least, Tech 2030 replies and says, a new all hand drawn 2D Metroid game for Wii U or 3DS would make me the most excited.
7184920	7189920	There you go. I love those answers. Thank you guys over on Google Plus and Facebook. Our Fugu question of the week.
7190920	7195920	I did read them all. I was in the holiday spirit. I wanted to read them all. I like hearing people's fanboy dreams.
7196920	7199920	What about you guys? Anything you would love to see the stealth announcement comes out?
7199920	7215920	I was replying to chat room. I don't know. I mean, really right now. I don't know. I really don't know. I guess I would go with the half-life thing.
7216920	7220920	Because that would be pretty awesome. Just the half-life. Okay, we're done. Bye.
7220920	7233920	The one thing I want more than anything. Dear Jesus, for your birthday, I would really like more than anything to see after all these years and all this hoping.
7234920	7238920	Remember, pray to be Jesus. And all this praying. Oh, Beyonce.
7239920	7245920	Dear Beyonce, may I please have the Guardian Legend on Virtual Console. Yes! Can I get an amen? Yes.
7245920	7265920	Or a true sequel. I will take what I can get. We need a Guardian Legend variety game. Compile needs to rise from their grave and not do any more Puyo Pop. We need more Guardian Legend and more compile shooters.
7266920	7277920	Alright, and locally? I'd go for a new DDR. You're just keeping it civil. I just want a new DDR. I mean, that would be shocking.
7278920	7288920	Hey, we're gonna do a new T-Garian. Really? What? It's only shocking if it's good. I would like for our Roosevelt Golf Land to magically have a 2DX machine again and not get rid of it.
7288920	7300920	By the way, Scandia's gonna get a 2DX machine probably. What? Well, you may remember the guy that runs Shonigan. He has this wonderful arcade. In his garage? In his garage.
7301920	7311920	Well, it's also the drive-in, too. No, I ran into, he works at Scandia. Yeah, he's picking three of his machines to bring in there. One of which is a 2DX 20, I guess, or whatever.
7311920	7318920	We actually randomly met while I was playing some game over there, one of the shooting games, and we just started talking about his machines.
7319920	7325920	I would love to get that guy on this show if he's here locally. He's on my Facebook. Send him a message. Get him on the show.
7326920	7332920	Alright, Shane is sending me a private message in chat because apparently I skipped his answer. It's because you answered late, you jerk.
7333920	7345920	But our buddy Shane from Hoard House says, I won a stealth announcement for F-Zero for Wii U and 3DS in the same style as the ACGX versions and then unlockable GX versions in both the Wii U and 3DS.
7346920	7351920	And Jack Levin's theme making a comeback because it was the best in GX. That's an awfully tall order, but I would love to see that.
7352920	7360920	Sorry, go ahead. The current votes for machines that they are going to bring is, top three machines will go to the location, top three so far.
7361920	7368920	2DX Linkle upgraded to Tricoral, Poppy Music 20 upgraded to Sunny Park, and DGMax Technica 3.
7369920	7374920	Actually, other is number three, but who knows how other is.
7375920	7379920	I agree with all of these selections, and I forgot what I was going to say, so it doesn't matter.
7379920	7381920	Well, then let's get back into some news. Loki.
7382920	7391920	Alright. So the Xbox One, let's talk a little bit more about that. I'm kind of surprised that they kind of went back.
7392920	7404920	I guess they never really worked for retail games, but they're not requiring demos. It's up to the devs to basically decide whether they're going to put a demo for their game.
7404920	7411920	Now originally, you had to have a demo for any Xbox Live Arcade game that was out there.
7412920	7417920	But now I guess they're kind of going the route of the retail games where it doesn't necessarily have to have a demo.
7418920	7425920	I kind of think that's a little lame because games are expensive, and sometimes the demos get you to buy the game.
7426920	7430920	Or in some cases, it gets you not to buy the game if you can't beat the demo.
7430920	7440920	But yeah. I don't know. It's interesting. There is one of the demos that they're actually putting out.
7441920	7451920	I really hate, I think Nintendo was the one that kind of started this, but those demos that have a certain number of playthroughs you can do on them before they lock you out of them completely.
7452920	7459920	Like Dead Rising 3, they're going to let you play it for 20 minutes, and then you can play it for two more times other than that, and then it's done.
7460920	7461920	That's interesting.
7462920	7467920	It's not that different from what PlayStation Plus has you do. You can play the first hour, but still.
7468920	7478920	Yeah, but I remember back when they had the timed demos for Saints Row, and I played that demo over and over and over again, and it just got me hyped about the game, and I bought it immediately when it came out.
7478920	7483920	But that's how I killed my time until it came out, is by playing that demo over and over and over again.
7484920	7486920	I guess, just, whatever.
7487920	7490920	Do you have to download the whole stinking thing just to play 20 minutes, or does it do the streaming thing?
7491920	7492920	I think it's probably a shorter demo.
7493920	7494920	That's good.
7495920	7497920	It's apparently the map, but it's just 20 minutes of it.
7498920	7499920	Interesting.
7500920	7512920	And they've also hit the 2 million sales mark as of the 11th, so hooray.
7513920	7514920	Oh sorry, go ahead.
7515920	7517920	So everybody's doing well, selling lots of consoles.
7518920	7522920	Everybody's spinning it like they're winning, but at the end of the day they're both doing well. Sony and Microsoft anyway.
7523920	7533920	Here's the only thing, not that I'm worrying about any of these companies, but I'm seeing a pattern emerge here, and it's what I saw with the Wii U.
7534920	7538920	Where, oh yeah, these things are sold at. Oh yeah, they're gonna be hard to find.
7539920	7544920	And yet, I'm hearing from a ton of people, hey I just saw a pallet of those just sitting at Costco, no one buying them.
7545920	7549920	Hey, I just saw a stack of those sitting at Target, no one buying them. Hey, I just saw a stack of them over there.
7550920	7551920	PlayStation 4 is not to be found.
7552920	7562920	So it gets me worried that maybe they aren't flying off the shelves. Not to say that they're doing bad, I mean they sold 2 million units worldwide, so that's not bad, but it may be slowing down a lot faster.
7563920	7568920	And I think a lot of that has to do probably with the launch line up, there's just not a lot to drive people to buy them.
7569920	7575920	So that's my concern, and I guess it would go with PlayStation 2, because maybe they're just not producing a ton of units.
7576920	7578920	I think they're about neck and neck as far as sales go.
7578920	7584920	It should be said as well, even though maybe Nintendo's not having the best luck with Wii U, and it doesn't seem like their fortune's turning around.
7585920	7589920	I mean they're selling more of them, but it's not in the same league as these other consoles right now.
7590920	7595920	3DS still continues to sell wildfires, I mean that's a huge success story for Nintendo, so at least there's that.
7596920	7597920	So they won't be going out of business.
7598920	7599920	No.
7600920	7606920	Anyhow, speaking of sales, let's go over to the MPD numbers, and Loki you might have to help me out here a little bit, because you read into more of the stuff than I do.
7606920	7613920	But video game sales for the US in November up 7% from last year, which you would hope is going to happen when you have new consoles out.
7614920	7619920	Hardware jumped up 58%, again with two new consoles out, you would hope those numbers go up.
7620920	7626920	PlayStation 4, the top selling console in November, and PlayStation was number one in sales overall for home consoles.
7627920	7631920	My 9,000 fans will be quick to tell you that, well, they had an additional week to sell those consoles.
7632920	7634920	Whatever, again, they're both doing very well.
7634920	7642920	909,132 Xbox One units sold in the US in the first nine days, meaning over 100,000 a day.
7643920	7646920	The top selling games, here's the top ten.
7647920	7648920	Number one, Call of Duty Ghosts.
7649920	7650920	Number two, Battlefield 4.
7651920	7652920	Number three, Assassin's Creed 4.
7653920	7654920	Number four, Madden 25.
7655920	7656920	Number five, Grand Theft Auto 5.
7657920	7658920	Number six, NBA 2K14.
7659920	7660920	Number seven, Skylanders Swap Force.
7661920	7662920	Number eight, Just Dance 2014.
7663920	7664920	Number nine, Disney Infinity.
7665920	7666920	And number ten, FIFA 14.
7667920	7672920	No surprise at all, you've got your typical big sellers, the Call of Duty and the Battlefield, your Assassin's Creed.
7672920	7680920	The sports balls, Grand Theft Auto's still in there, and then the kiddie toy games with Skylanders and Disney Infinity rounding out your top ten.
7681920	7682920	Not a lot of surprises in there, right?
7683920	7687920	No. Let's talk about some of those Nintendo numbers, because we do have some numbers about Nintendo.
7688920	7694920	770,000 Nintendo 3DS's sold in November.
7695920	7701920	So the 3DS has been out for a couple years, and they sold almost as many of those as they did Xbox Ones.
7702920	7703920	Pretty good.
7704920	7708920	Also, Wii U hardware sales, they say up by 340%.
7709920	7716920	But I think we all know that's kind of a spin, because three times a little number is still not probably going to be a huge number.
7717920	7718920	But it is what it is.
7719920	7723920	But Super Mario 3D World, 215,000 digital and physical units in the first eight days.
7724920	7729920	Not too shabby, especially in light of the article from Japan that didn't have quite the impressive number last week.
7729920	7733920	But it should be noted that didn't allow it to crack the top ten.
7734920	7745920	But considering that Super Mario 3D World is on one console, and one console that hasn't really cracked through, as well as every single one of those games in the top ten that I read off, multiple formats.
7746920	7752920	Yeah, I would assume I'm looking right here at some of the weekly charts for hardware.
7753920	7755920	Trying to see if I can pull up older stuff.
7756920	7757920	That's not helping.
7757920	7768920	Anyways, for hardware though, for example, the week of the 7th, that would have been the week ago, Wii U moved 72,000 units in North America.
7769920	7772920	And the 3DS, 244,000.
7773920	7781920	Kind of give you an idea, when they're saying 700,000, you're probably looking at maybe 150,000 units of Wii U.
7782920	7783920	It's not bad.
7784920	7785920	It's good.
7785920	7791920	Again, it's one of those things where it's not going to bankrupt the company, but it's going to be very interesting to see what they do in 2014.
7792920	7793920	Like, is Nintendo going to stick with it?
7794920	7799920	And I kind of think they're stubborn enough, and they believe in it enough that I think they're going to stick with it.
7800920	7809920	I'm not sure what they're going to do to sell more, but I think they believe enough in Bayonetta, and Smash Brothers, and whatever Zelda or Mario game they have hidden up their sleeve for holiday 2014.
7810920	7812920	Mario Kart next year is going to be huge.
7812920	7815920	I think they believe enough in those that they're going to still try.
7816920	7826920	I hope it turns it around for them, because if Mario Kart or Smash Brothers can't move units, then they're going to be in trouble.
7827920	7830920	There are some people saying that Nintendo will announce a new console at this E3. No.
7831920	7832920	No. That's way too soon.
7833920	7835920	Internally, are they having that dialogue? Probably.
7836920	7840920	But, I don't know. It's going to be very interesting to see what happens at E3 this year for Nintendo.
7840920	7846920	They seem to be pushing themselves into that outside of the regular release stuff, you know?
7847920	7853920	Well, it's just disappointing. The third-party support's just not there. I mean, they're going to be showing stuff on screen.
7854920	7859920	They're always going to say that they have the third-party support, but they don't have full third-party support, and that's what's really hurt them.
7860920	7861920	Well, 3DS does.
7862920	7865920	Not necessarily. There's no EA 3DS games anymore.
7866920	7867920	Oh, wow. Okay.
7868920	7869920	Yeah, they've completely cut them off.
7870920	7872920	There's plenty of stuff on 3DS keeping it going, you know?
7873920	7874920	There's plenty of stuff on 3DS.
7875920	7879920	That's when they speak about Nintendo partners and not just 3DS and Wii U separately, you know what I mean?
7880920	7884920	Yeah, because EA's not supporting them on any of the platforms right now.
7885920	7889920	Zebediah the Messiah in our chatroom says, Mario Kart Wii U bundle and I'm in.
7890920	7892920	I think that's a guaranteed from Nintendo.
7893920	7897920	If not, you know Costco and Best Buy and all that. They're going to have their bundles, absolutely.
7897920	7905920	YYR says, Smash Brothers usually sells consoles, but I think the biggest threat to Smash selling Wii U consoles is Smash for 3DS.
7906920	7913920	Well, the other thing, too, is a lot of people already bought the Wii U for Smash Brothers, so you can't really count a lot of new sales from that.
7914920	7916920	Who buys a console for a game two years out from now?
7918920	7919920	Really?
7920920	7921920	We kind of considered.
7922920	7923920	You considered, but you didn't?
7924920	7925920	No.
7925920	7926920	You know, anyway.
7927920	7932920	I would say if you're going to get a Wii U, get a fucking Wii U because the Mario 3D World is one of the best games you're going to play this year, period.
7933920	7941920	Especially if you have people in your house to play games with or people over frequently, you will not find a better party multiplayer game experience than you will with Mario 3D World.
7942920	7948920	That's what you're missing. But, you know, again, do you want to pay three, what would that be, about $300 system plus game?
7949920	7950920	Just wait, the price will come down.
7951920	7953920	Do you want to pay $300 to be the coolest kid on the block?
7953920	7954920	I don't know.
7955920	7959920	Anyhow, let's move on. More news. Dark Sakura.
7960920	7967920	Well, I do have another bit of news, and this actually came to me by means of one of my friends who I met through Tumblr.
7968920	7972920	And I have to give you the story of how I met her later, but it was very interesting.
7973920	7974920	Trading porn pics?
7975920	7976920	No. Okay.
7977920	7978920	I love Tumblr. I'm just here for the gifts.
7978920	7983920	I was at the Russian market and saw one of their free publications with someone's Homestuck fan art on it, on the cover.
7984920	7986920	And the article that it was advertising had nothing to do with Homestuck.
7987920	7991920	So I found out who did it, messaged her, and mailed her the magazine in Australia.
7992920	7993920	Wow, that's something.
7994920	8001920	And so we've been chatting off and on back. She's a really good artist. She's done a thank you pic for me. She's a really, really good artist.
8001920	8016920	But she linked me this story about how the South Australian government is doing an anti-gaming campaign that has a little girl with shades on at a poker table looking at her iPad saying, gambling starts with games.
8017920	8025920	And basically what they're trying to do is, you know, I think it has more to do with the Facebook style and casual games.
8026920	8031920	You know, the online poker and the microtransaction type games.
8032920	8040920	But they have a site that's called nogame.sa.gov.au, which I hate giving it anything, but go look at it and laugh.
8041920	8048920	So basically it's supposed to say, it's wanting to add an MA 15 plus to any game that includes simulated gambling.
8049920	8061920	Meaning slot machines, card mechanics, even what was the last Pokemon games, Diamond and Pearl had like a slot machine thing in them, didn't they?
8062920	8063920	I don't remember.
8063920	8070920	Or, you know, any game that has some kind of variety of anything that could be construed as gambling.
8071920	8073920	So they're trying to get this bit of a...
8074920	8078920	Is Pachinko considered gambling? Because Nintendo Land has the Pachinko in it. It's totally gambling.
8079920	8081920	Well, Pachinko technically is gambling, it's just...
8082920	8084920	Final Fantasy X-2 has like, Casino Land.
8085920	8090920	Well, I mean, look at Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Casino Night Zone.
8091920	8092920	Which was like the best zone in the whole game.
8093920	8099920	MM2K in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Australian government hates games. It sure seems that way.
8100920	8113920	Well, Ron Curry, who is the CEO of Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, has gone out saying that the view is supported by the fact that there was no consultation with an industry lead in the lead up to this policy announcement and the subsequent awareness campaign.
8114920	8121920	Meaning that they haven't even reached out to work with the companies, they're just going on a broad generalization.
8121920	8132920	And, you know, the way that this was linked to me is, have you seen this fuckery? I mean, that's not exactly what, you know, how she said it, but it was pretty much the same thing.
8133920	8141920	And she was going on to explain how there's a lot of revenue in South Australia comes from slot machines.
8142920	8148920	There's a big problem with gambling because, and I believe they're called pokies there?
8148920	8160920	But we're blaming games for that? I just, out of curiosity, I wanted to know, because you know, right here in the States right now, everybody's talking about Mega Millions, because the lottery is up to like $500 million, even I'm buying a lotto ticket, that says something.
8161920	8169920	I usually don't pay the idiot tax, as my mom calls it. You gonna pay the idiot tax, Rob? You know, when you buy the lottery tickets, you're an idiot. But anyway.
8170920	8171920	Yeah, she wouldn't be saying that if you won.
8172920	8173920	Yeah, exactly. When I win and we see what home she gets put in.
8174920	8176920	Let her retire in Boca.
8176920	8186920	Well, as she also says, it costs a dollar to dream these days, doesn't it Rob? Anyway, the reason why I bring that up is I was curious, does Australia have the lottery?
8187920	8192920	And because I don't know much about the culture there, does Australia have lottery? Maybe some chatters can set me straight. I don't know if we have any Aussies in chat tonight.
8193920	8199920	But I'm looking at Wikipedia, which I always love to go to, to look up information. It looks like there's some different types of Australian lotteries, kind of depending about where you are.
8199920	8208920	There's TATS has a lottery in Victoria, Tasmania, in the Australian Capital Territory, in the Northern Territory. And then there's some state-owned, including the South Australian lotteries.
8209920	8220920	So the reason why I bring that up is like, well, okay, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. The government has a sanctioned lottery system, yet we're gonna pinpoint video games as don't play games because it'll lead to gambling.
8220920	8242920	Okay, well, and this is the other thing, too. And then it's actually caused, and just going by what my friend told me, and she links me to quite a bit of information, is that there, apparently when they brought in the slot machines, and I think she called them pokies, you know, like poker machines or something.
8242920	8253920	But she said that they've actually been instilled in a lot of bars and public, you know, in pubs, and have replaced like live bands playing and other things because they do bring in a lot more money.
8254920	8264920	And you don't find as many just, I guess, cultural events. They've all become these loud places that attract an unfavorable element.
8264920	8273920	And it's caused, you know, there have been political parties formed to, you know, to get rid of the legalized gambling.
8274920	8292920	And so if people are having such a big problem with it to the point that they're trying to censor games to prevent that, why don't they just pass the legislation and get rid of the machines, or else regulate them a lot harder than they are now?
8292920	8299920	Here's the other side of that. They get a lot of money from those machines. They get a lot of money from those machines.
8300920	8309920	It was like in Mississippi, after Katrina, because they didn't want the casinos on Mississippi soil so they were on barges.
8309920	8320920	And then right after Katrina hit and the casinos were like, we're going to leave because we're not going to build them on barges for the next hurricane to knock us over.
8321920	8326920	Mississippi changed their laws really quickly so that they could keep that source of revenue and keep all those jobs in Biloxi.
8327920	8335920	Yeah, it's obviously, if you know somebody that's addicted to gambling, you know, that's a real thing, but there's lots of, you can get addicted to anything.
8336920	8338920	You know, you can get addicted to video games and that's dangerous too.
8339920	8340920	It's obsessive compulsive behavior.
8341920	8345920	Yeah. So, you know, if you're going to, I like gambling. Did video games cause that? I don't think so.
8346920	8347920	I hate gambling.
8347920	8353920	I also put a limit on my gambling. Like if I go to Reno or something, I usually say, okay, a hundred dollars in fun money.
8354920	8360920	That's how much I would spend on a concert ticket to go see a AAA concert or, you know, a night out with drinks for Alan and I.
8361920	8376920	Your limit is about 10 times more than my limit because the only times I have ever gone gambling, like with a purpose, is when I had 50 cents and needed cab money and made myself $15.
8377920	8383920	Well, and it, it depends. It depends too. Like a hundred dollars is like my weekend in Reno type money, you know, that's reasonable.
8383920	8394920	But if I'm just, you know, I'm going to the Indian casino out in Roseville, I'll maybe spend $10, you know, not even that. So just depends on what I'm doing.
8395920	8399920	YYR in chat says, gambling video games might cause gambling.
8400920	8408920	Well, but I don't, I don't know. Like it's just weird for me to say that, oh, because they played it in the game, they, they got addicted to gambling.
8408920	8414920	I mean, if that, if they were wired for that anyway, wouldn't just playing gambling kind of get them into that?
8415920	8429920	It has to do with, and this is, I kind of have a problem with calling certain behaviors an addiction, except they do, they do give that same sort of chemical response.
8429920	8444920	So in that case, you're creating your own drug by performing the action. And so it comes, the only way to break that is to either remove the ability to do the action or remove the positive sensation that comes from the action.
8444920	8460920	But even with, you know, losing money, losing friends, you know, suffering financial difficulties because of the reward, the, the behavior, it doesn't stop that feeling of pleasure that somebody gets from participating in it.
8461920	8467920	Which is why you have people that are addicted to gambling. You have people that are addicted to gaming. You have people who are pathological house cleaners.
8468920	8472920	You know, it's all the same kind of pleasure response that comes from.
8473920	8479920	That's my mother. My mother will follow you in the house with a vacuum cleaner. She will, no joke. I have literally caught her doing this.
8480920	8486920	So like I had a cup of coffee and I sat it on her counter or whatever. And like, you know, I was talking to her and then I picked it up and put the cup away in the sink.
8487920	8489920	And she came in right behind me and wiped down the counter.
8490920	8514920	But it's, I'm trying to, um, there's, and for a lot of people, you know, I'm trying to, to get back to what I was trying to say with this too, is that instead of treating the enabler being the gambling or the gateway as they're calling it, the games that have the gambling element,
8514920	8526920	they need to treat the, the behavior addiction. You shouldn't penalize a whole group for something that's a problem of a handful of people.
8527920	8534920	Well, if you or someone you know got addicted to gambling and video games are to blame for it, we'd love to hear from you. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8535920	8536920	Meanwhile, back into the news, Loki.
8537920	8539920	That sounds like one of those advertisements for like Ricky Lake or something.
8540920	8542920	Call 1-877-GO-RICKY!
8542920	8548920	Did your drag queen dad beat you when you were a child? If so, call us now.
8549920	8551920	That show is such a fucking train wreck. I love it.
8552920	8556920	Cause she'd be like, oh my God, I'm not getting into this, just stand back and watch, like, oh my God.
8557920	8562920	It was always that look of her hand pressed against her face and her jaw dropped, like, I can't control what's going on.
8563920	8565920	Oh, Ricky, go back to doing, uh, uh, Waters movies.
8565920	8573920	The legit best weave pulling of all time came from the Ricky Lake show, too. Just Google it. Like, Ricky Lake weave pulling, you'll, it's fascinating. Anyway.
8574920	8575920	So, yeah.
8576920	8579920	SSJ 100 Matt says, uh, Australian PSA don't gamble or a dingo will eat your baby.
8580920	8584920	I'm sure the Australians that listen to this show greatly appreciate that, SSJ 100 Matt.
8585920	8591920	So, what do you expect? When a game service doesn't exactly work like it's supposed to, what are you to do?
8591920	8600920	Of course, you're, you know, you should go on the internet and complain. And then, of course, then the lawyers come and decide, hey, let's make this into a class action lawsuit.
8601920	8607920	In which case, that's what's happening now with a law firm investigating EA and Battlefield 4.
8608920	8615920	Um, law firm Holzer Holzer and Holzer Holzer and Fistel. I love that name. That's awesome.
8616920	8632920	Um, LLC is investigating whether EA, um, I guess, you know, claim, they claim that regarding the development and sales of Battlefield 4 and its impact on EA's revenue and project moving forward, compile, or complied with federal security law.
8632920	8640920	I don't even know what the hell that means. All that I know is people are bitching about Battlefield 4 and that I'm guessing that they're smelling money somewhere.
8641920	8647920	That, hmm, that whole SimCity thing was really fucked up and people were really pissed by that. Maybe we can get some of the money out of that.
8648920	8649920	EA's got money, right?
8650920	8653920	Yeah, EA's got a bit of money, I think. Because they charge us for everything.
8654920	8657920	Um, I'm thinking, though, that this may not necessarily be...
8657920	8661920	If the internet wins this class action lawsuit, we lose.
8662920	8675920	Well, here's the thing. It's not necessarily for, like, people that are playing the game. It's for investors, basically saying that they misled investors that they knew that Battlefield 4 was going to be a fucked up thing and that they knew that they were going to lose money and stuff.
8676920	8686920	And so that's how, you know, that's what it's all about. But, yeah, I mean, seriously, though, it's money. They smell money, they're going to go for the money. It's like blood and sharks.
8687920	8688920	What are you going to do?
8689920	8691920	The shark is delicious, but you can't eat people.
8692920	8699920	Alright, well, I know I would eat this game right up if it comes out. Who doesn't love the Seiken Densetsu series?
8700920	8706920	And if you don't know it by that name, perhaps if I said Secret of Mana? Remember that game? That was a classic, classic Super Nintendo game.
8707920	8708920	Which is sad because Legend of Mana was kind of crap.
8709920	8712920	Legend of Mana was pretty balls, but Seiken Densetsu 3, really good.
8713920	8714920	Hardcore awesome.
8714920	8724920	Secret of Evermore, underrated. I realize it wasn't really part of the same series because it was Square America's game, but underrated, I think. Time, you know, kind of was really mean to that game.
8725920	8730920	But, anyway, the Of Mana series, I think a lot of us would love to play a new game in that again.
8731920	8742920	Well, there are hints that an unannounced title in the series could be brewing, and this is because of a Christmas album that featured a song from an as of yet unreleased game.
8742920	8751920	The official page for Xmas Collections 2 includes a mention of Seiken Densetsu, the series' Japanese name, labeled as Future Project.
8752920	8762920	Now, could this be Circle of Mana? Circle of Mana was a Japanese release on iOS and Android devices, which is very strange that we don't have that here yet.
8763920	8766920	I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of time before that's translated and comes out over here.
8766920	8773920	Jamie instantly picked up her phone and started searching. Only in Japan, Jamie. Only in Japan. You can look and bookmark it.
8774920	8775920	This is why you jailbreak your devices.
8776920	8787920	Right? So, anyhow, I know I would love to see a new Of Mana game. I really hope that is something that's in the pipeline for, oh, wouldn't that be an awesome PlayStation 4 game?
8788920	8793920	A new Of Mana game? I just hope it's more Secret of Mana and less Legend of Mana. That would be amazing.
8793920	8799920	Dark Sakura, Loki? Do you think there could be any truth here? Do you think it's just Circle of Mana?
8800920	8801920	I need new pants.
8802920	8810920	Alright. Let's move on to the mailbag. Dark Sakura, unfortunately, will have to put her phone down to find the game that she's not going to be able to find.
8811920	8813920	And we're going to go to the mailbag.
8813920	8825920	Alright, every week you guys email us mailbag at orangelountradio.com and Dark Sakura's going to dive into the mailbag head first and find an email that she thinks, hey!
8826920	8827920	This one's twitching.
8828920	8834920	This one should be read on air because if I don't read it, we'll get another email next week chewing me out.
8835920	8838920	Only a couple emails this week, right? Just one or two, right?
8839920	8840920	Three.
8841920	8842920	Oh, three. Okay.
8843920	8851920	You guys do a video game podcast, but you couldn't be bothered to actually watch a video games award show. However, you were able to do a little Monday morning quarterbacking and bash the show none of you watched.
8852920	8858920	Wow. I didn't bash anything. I watched the livestream, and it was better than the usual shtick you see in award shows.
8859920	8866920	Instead of making a big deal about the subjective superlatives of best this and that, the show is bringing gamers the previews of upcoming games, something all gamers are normally excited to see.
8866920	8876920	And bashing Joel is just mean. He was hired to do a job, and I thought he earned his pay. Calling him transphobic was unfairly judgmental, considering you didn't watch the show and everything you heard about it was taken out of context.
8877920	8885920	Hey guys, you do have a right to your opinion, but next time do your homework. You do a video game podcast. It seems a little odd and disappointing that not one of you took the time to watch the show again. Wow. Sincerely, Nark.
8886920	8890920	I don't remember saying anything about the guy because I didn't watch it and I didn't have anything to say.
8891920	8902920	I didn't watch it and I was recanting things that I read across the internet. I know that people were offended at some of the things that Joel McHale said, whether you weren't or not, other people were.
8903920	8905920	Wow, I thought I was defending them, but yeah.
8906920	8917920	You know what, this guy's welcome to his opinion, but I kind of have a problem with the, because I didn't, he says, because you guys have a video game podcast, you should watch this show.
8918920	8919920	No. Why?
8920920	8923920	If it's something I don't care about watching, I don't have to watch anything.
8923920	8939920	I listen to other independent podcasts that do their award shows and I'm curious what they have to say. People like, you know, you and me that do their own shows and I read websites. What, what makes this any more or less of a deal than those?
8940920	8948920	That was not proven to me in the email. The only thing I heard in there was, Oh, they have previews of new games. Great. I did look at all of those on YouTube after.
8948920	8953920	Yeah. And if Joel was so great, why did they excise him completely from the TV version?
8954920	8967920	And I watched part of the show and I didn't, can't watch the whole thing because I had things to do that day, but I did catch part of it and I commented on the part that I saw as well as the recaps I saw on YouTube, which I know were cleverly edited together.
8967920	8982920	If I was going to be perfectly honest about it, I've been so busy with school and other stuff. I actually didn't even know it was on. So like I said, I, I have my feelings about what I've heard from that, but I don't care either way.
8983920	8986920	If you play a musical instrument, are you required to watch the Grammys?
8987920	8988920	No.
8988920	9004920	If you make home movies, are you required to watch the Oscars? That's I'm just, you know, I'm just kind of throwing it out there as like, I, I I'm challenging is, I mean, because obviously this guy puts VGX up on a pedestal, you know, which is fine.
9005920	9009920	You're allowed to do that. And maybe, maybe, maybe we were too harsh on things.
9009920	9025920	I think his criticism is that we're criticizing the show yet we didn't watch the entire show, but Oh my God, if I had to watch that entire show, I'd be tearing my hair out because it was slow. It was very slow paced. And, and I was trying to, I was trying to explain two things last week.
9025920	9038920	One, what I heard everybody else saying, because yeah, of course I'm going to kind of, you know, say, Oh, this is the feeling I was getting. And I read this person's blog that was very upset over the joke that Joel McHale said, because this was a transgender person themselves.
9039920	9053920	It was very upset at the joke, you know? So yeah, I was going to communicate that, you know, I heard some people were pretty pissed off at this joke. And then, um, uh, I'm telling you why I don't, you know, I don't watch it because I don't see the reason to.
9054920	9067920	And it's not like I can sit here on a video game show and just flat out say, which is the honest truth, that I didn't care about the fact that there was an award show. I didn't care who won and I didn't care about watching it. That doesn't make good radio.
9068920	9078920	I love video games. You, the emailer, love video games. The chatters that are here love video games, Dark Soccer and Loki love video games. That is why we do a video game podcast. End.
9079920	9080920	For the record, I really didn't care.
9080920	9093920	No, and I don't want to like sound combative or anything, although this email was pretty pointed because everybody does have a right to their opinion. And I can get where you're kind of like, well, don't shut your, shut your yap if you're going to comment on something you didn't even watch.
9094920	9098920	But I, it's what's going on out there. We have to comment on it somehow.
9099920	9108920	And this is a big human nature kind of thing, at least amongst the average neuro-typical human being. No one likes to hear when someone does not like something that they like.
9108920	9119920	A very good point. However, it must be understood that sometimes you may like something and other people either will not like it or don't give a shit about it. You have to live with that.
9120920	9131920	You wrote that article on VOG this week all about Homestuck, which is something, well, but to be fair, that's something plenty of people have judged without really looking at it themselves. Would that be accurate to say?
9131920	9132920	I'd say so, yeah.
9133920	9143920	And that could be plenty because some of the cosplayers have been boneheads, and you touched on that in the article. And so, you know, sometimes it's people giving it a bad image and so forth.
9144920	9156920	Well, when I was looking for graphics, because I wanted a good background to do the banner from, I actually found a write-up by a mother who had just thought it was the crap.
9156920	9165920	She wasn't interested in it, she thought it was corrupting her kids, and then actually took the time to sit and go through the entire thing and ended up loving the story.
9166920	9173920	I mean, a mom probably in her 50s ended up really liking it, and already a sci-fi fan found things that she could relate to in it.
9174920	9186920	And I think that, you know, maybe if I had sat down and watched it, then maybe I would have liked it, but I didn't care enough, and I didn't bash it. I don't think I bashed it, did I?
9187920	9192920	I don't know. Chris109 in our chat room says, video games rule. I agree, dude. Video games rule.
9193920	9198920	And Chris109 says, opinions. They are awesome, yet cause issues because people misunderstand it.
9198920	9205920	You know what, I'm gonna say thank you for the email, and I think if people think we need to be called out on something, then do it.
9206920	9213920	Tone is gonna be very important in that. If we get an email that says, fuck you, you fucking fuck, then we're probably not gonna respond to that in kind.
9214920	9215920	Because that's probably one of my emails.
9216920	9226920	Well, it goes back to that Facebook comment from a couple weeks ago. As long as you do it respectfully, we'll have a respectful dialogue, and then at the end of the day, have a beer and play some games.
9226920	9229920	I don't think that the email was disrespectful.
9230920	9237920	I don't either. It was a little bit pointed, but I understand why there's anger.
9238920	9249920	But I also think that at the same time, just because, and this is something actually I kind of wish I'd put in my article too, is that for, and I do understand that if you're not gonna watch something, it doesn't put you in a position to bash it.
9250920	9258920	However, it doesn't mean that you can't, you know, take a community-wide opinion and report on it. Which is what we did.
9259920	9263920	Have you bashed Lady Gaga's album without listening to it?
9264920	9265920	Well, I haven't listened to it.
9265920	9267920	I'm just asking the listenership out there.
9268920	9272920	There's people who will flat out just bash Lady Gaga because she's her.
9273920	9277920	Or bash a movie that you haven't really seen. Or bash a musical.
9278920	9279920	Or bash Nickelback because it's cool.
9280920	9288920	Well, okay, let's be real though. Yes, I have heard plenty of Nickelback, unfortunately, and all that's just, I think we can all agree Nickelback sucks.
9289920	9291920	Next email, sorry.
9291920	9300920	Season's Greetings and Salutations, O.L.R. I love when people say that. You know what movie that line came from? Heathers. Greetings and Salutations.
9301920	9302920	I love Heathers. I need to watch that.
9303920	9304920	Had Shannon Doherty in it. She was awesome.
9305920	9306920	So was Winona Ryder.
9307920	9308920	I love Winona Ryder. I want her to be my sister or something.
9309920	9310920	When Winona Ryder showed up.
9311920	9316920	My dream family is like George Takei as my daddy and Winona Ryder as like my cool older sister.
9317920	9318920	Betty White as your grandma.
9318920	9319920	Betty White as my grandmother.
9320920	9324920	When Winona Ryder showed up in Star Trek, I was so excited.
9325920	9327920	I know, and then they cut like half her seams.
9328920	9329920	So disappointing. Anyway.
9330920	9332920	Okay, firstly, I hope Rob is recovering from the VOG plague.
9333920	9337920	First, I heard it affect Jess from USL, then Shane from Hoard House, now Allen and Rob.
9338920	9341920	To prevent yourselves from getting the plague, all VOG members should perform the anti-VOG plague ritual.
9342920	9347920	It involves a dead hippo, burnt out TV tubes, short bits of string, and fire-breathing squirrel. No.
9348920	9353920	I feel a lot better today than I did yesterday. I don't have a temperature and I'm not like congested in the head.
9354920	9359920	It's just I have stuffiness, but I'll be back to work tomorrow. It just sucks to be sick on a weekend when I had social stuff planned.
9360920	9365920	I love everybody in the chat. Chris, Winona, and I know they really suck.
9366920	9372920	Anyways, the reason I am emailing you all is because this week has been a significant week for my mobile gaming.
9373920	9376920	For the past few months, I've been playing a mobile game called Jurassic Park Builder.
9376920	9382920	It's basically a run-of-the-mill sim game involving filling your park with dinosaurs and leveling them to create cash.
9383920	9385920	This cash can be used to expand your park, place buildings, and deck out your park.
9386920	9390920	This week, I was taken aback with the game's recent update, which integrated a dinosaur battle arena.
9391920	9396920	This arena allows your dinosaurs to battle against the AI's dinosaurs, and soon it will integrate multiplayer into this battle system.
9397920	9405920	This new update has totally changed the flavor of the simple management simulator into becoming a strategic Pokemon-like fighting game only with dinosaurs.
9406920	9411920	With that being said, have you ever encountered an update on a non-MMO game that changed the very nature of the original game?
9412920	9414920	How did you feel about those changes? Not so sincerely, Degenerate Johnny.
9415920	9420920	That's a really tough question, because in this day and age, I mean, we're used to the whole patching and things like that,
9421920	9426920	but like, you know, that's something new in the past ten years where games are updated like that and changed like that.
9427920	9429920	That's only new since iPhone. I honestly can't think of anything.
9429920	9437920	I know one, Mortal Kombat 2, from the beta versions to the new ones because you lost your infinite combos as they tweaked stuff.
9438920	9445920	Ooh, Luminous on the iPhone actually made it playable, because the first version was awful, but then they actually changed the control scheme and it's actually playable.
9446920	9452920	That was a big one. Let me say this though, I'll answer the question with this, so I'm going to take it a slightly different direction, sorry about it,
9453920	9457920	but back in the day, I remember when sequels would go in really random directions.
9457920	9465920	Like Zelda 2? Right, Zelda 2 for better or worse. I did a Let's Remember this week, plug plug, on my YouTube channel, Rob Roberts Plays,
9466920	9470920	youtube.com slash Rob Roberts Plays, plug plug, but I did a Let's Remember for the game Donkey Kong 3.
9471920	9476920	Yes, that one was bizarre. Wasn't it? Yes, it was very bizarre because it was such a departure, and I even talked about this in the video,
9477920	9479920	it was such a departure from Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr., because those two were platformers.
9480920	9483920	Although I think it had more in common with Junior. Well, Donkey Kong 3 was a fucking shooter game.
9483920	9491920	Yeah, but it was with the Donkey Kong skin on it. But the otherwise look of the game, I think, had more in common with Junior.
9492920	9498920	Except for the fact that Stanley disappeared, never to be seen again, except in obscure references in Smash Brothers,
9499920	9503920	and I think was in a Game & Watch game, but that's really it. But I think about back in the NES games,
9504920	9507920	sometimes sequels were really radical departures from the original games, absolutely.
9507920	9516920	Even Castlevania 2 really played, I mean, sure it was still the whole jump and whip and all that type of stuff that the first game had.
9517920	9523920	But what a terrible night for a curse. But the first game was more of an arcade game, where the second game was more of an adventure backdrop.
9524920	9531920	It was more of an annoying game. I love the sequel though. 3 was great. Anyway, that's the best we can do with the answers there.
9532920	9535920	By the way, SSJ100Matt says that Heathers is going to be an off-Broadway show.
9535920	9539920	Well, I was going to say in chat as well, Raginator, talking about Heathers, Raginator in chat says,
9540920	9543920	Heathers also gave us the line, well fuck me gently with a chainsaw.
9544920	9552920	It also gave us the line, Big Fun was one, and I love my dead gay son.
9557920	9562920	If you're a fan of Orange Lawns Radio, you do need to watch the movie Heathers. Have you seen the movie Heathers, Loki? Please tell me you've seen Heathers.
9562920	9563920	No.
9563920	9565920	Oh my god, Loki, you're killing me.
9565920	9567920	Oh my god, that's the best movie.
9570920	9572920	It also was like...
9574920	9576920	They used to play it on Comedy Central like every other day.
9577920	9580920	Great pate, but I really must dash if I'm going to meet that funeral.
9581920	9585920	Alright, anyway. Watch Heathers this holiday season. You'll thank us later.
9586920	9592920	And it's the movie that got Que Sera Sera stuck in my head every time someone says the name Heather.
9597920	9598920	Last email.
9599920	9611920	Dear Orange Lawns Radio, with the release of some less than stellar Wii U and Super Mario 3D World sales figures this past week, it has been provided yet another excuse for doom and gloom for the console.
9612920	9619920	This led me to wonder when exactly sales figures started mattering to people who aren't investors, more than liking the games and the systems that were being played.
9620920	9625920	I myself have loved my Wii U since release date, and it has absolutely changed how gaming has fit into my life.
9626920	9633920	My boyfriend has become an avid gamer due to a mixture of first-party titles and indie releases that he would never have bothered playing elsewhere.
9634920	9641920	The system never fails to create memories at parties, and Nintendo's mastery of the couch co-op style of gameplay is still as evident as ever.
9642920	9654920	But even loving the system as much as I do, I am still given pause to doubt myself when I hear people focus so heavily on something as impersonal as sales data as something that should speak to the quality of a system.
9655920	9663920	I understand that low sales numbers have a heavy implication on the future viability of a system, but what does this have to do with the games that are out?
9664920	9667920	How are the existing games made any better or worse because fewer people have played them?
9668920	9679920	People never seem to poo-poo games exclusively that are niche titles and have limited sales potential, yet any big-budget or big-name title that underperforms always seems to face this criticism these days.
9680920	9690920	So my question to you is this. Now that companies make such public displays of game sales and sales data for gaming-related products are so easy to locate, is liking a product enough?
9691920	9708920	I am always willing to speak well for titles I enjoy, never to the exclusion of others, whenever the topic arises, but is there something else that can be done to improve the image of products such as Super Mario 3D World, which will likely have its spectacular reviews overshadowed by being one of the lowest-selling 3D Mario titles ever?
9710920	9711920	Was that it?
9712920	9717920	Thank you for the entertainment you provide each week, and, um, Daniel.
9718920	9719920	Because I don't say last names on there.
9720920	9722920	I think that was a good email, and thank you for that.
9723920	9724920	And thank you for your masterful grammar.
9725920	9728920	Sales shouldn't matter to your enjoyment of the game.
9729920	9730920	No, it shouldn't.
9731920	9733920	Oh for fuck's sake, I like Xanadu.
9734920	9741920	Haven't we talked about this on a previous show as well? There's those cult games that maybe not everybody necessarily played, but you love.
9742920	9747920	Like I talked about, there's a great card game called Cultcept that's like Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering. Love those games.
9748920	9754920	But they don't sell beans here. In fact, I think they didn't even come out with a 3DS version here because those games didn't sell very well, which was a tragedy.
9755920	9758920	But yeah, you should like what you're gonna like, no matter what.
9759920	9760920	There should be no shame in your game.
9760920	9761920	Yeah.
9762920	9771920	You know, I love bad movies better than some of the top rated Oscar winning movies ever. I picked up Barbarella recently and I fucking love that movie because Jane Fonda was hot, sorry.
9772920	9782920	But, um, but I mean, it shouldn't be a guilty pleasure. It should just be a pleasure. And if you love it, fucking love it.
9783920	9789920	It doesn't matter how well or how niche or how many copies is sold or anything. Just like what you like.
9790920	9799920	Um, I think you're right. I think there's a lot of, um, well, well, it's, it's the whole thing about some people feel that theirs has to be the best, that theirs is better than everybody else.
9800920	9801920	It's that whole fanboyism.
9802920	9803920	That's awesome Unicorn.
9804920	9805920	Oh yeah, in the chat?
9806920	9809920	I love you awesome Unicorn because I also read grammar and etymology books for fun.
9810920	9812920	You should change your nick to awesome emailing Unicorn.
9812920	9820920	Um, what was I going to say? Um, ah, you made me lose my tangent with that. Uh, lose my thought.
9821920	9824920	Um, Barbarella Psychadela.
9825920	9830920	But people, people should play whatever they, they want and like it. And oh yeah, the fanboyism.
9831920	9837920	People will use sales figures and wield it as a weapon as something like, you know, look at, look at what's going on with PlayStation four and Xbox one.
9837920	9846920	They're both selling well, but still the fanboys are going to say, oh well, but it's because the number of regions this is selling in and it's because of, you know, such and such.
9847920	9854920	And to be fair, we've asked those same questions on the show, but that's because we know there's spin going into this from Microsoft and Sony.
9855920	9860920	And we are kind of curious like which one is, is, is selling a little better, but that doesn't make the other system worse necessarily.
9861920	9869920	I'm a Wii U owner. I like my Wii U an awful lot, even though I didn't necessarily care for the wonderful 101 and I'm going to hear shit about that nonstop this week.
9870920	9879920	But I love Mario 3D World. It is one of my top five games of the year for sure. Um, and I, I know Nintendo is going to put out some great stuff for it in 2014.
9880920	9885920	And there are more reasons to buy a Wii U right now than there are to buy a PlayStation four or Xbox one.
9885920	9893920	Will that be the same story in 2014? That's what I'm a little worried about for Nintendo's sake, but 3DS will keep them afloat.
9894920	9900920	And you know what? Like whatever you're going to like. There's lots of great games to justify a Wii, excuse me, justify a Wii U purchase.
9901920	9904920	Love is not wrong, but it can sometimes be really gross and sticky.
9906920	9908920	All right. Uh, is that it?
9909920	9912920	Yerp. That is it for emails. Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
9912920	9919920	And by the way, I would like to go back and still thank NARP for the email. Thank you for being honest with us and making your opinion known.
9920920	9921920	I said thank you for that email as well, didn't I?
9922920	9925920	But I didn't say thank you and I'm saying thank you so that he doesn't think I'm a total bitch. I am only a 95% bitch.
9926920	9929920	Thank you to Generate Johnny too, because I don't think we thanked him for the email either.
9930920	9932920	Thank you. And thank you unicorn friend with the great grammar.
9933920	9937920	All right. Thank you to everybody who takes the time out of the week to say hello to us. We appreciate it.
9937920	9941920	And thank you to anybody else who loves Xanadu and Barbarella because those are the two best movies ever.
9942920	9943920	Uh, no.
9944920	9948920	You watched them at my Bachelorette party when we were eating jello shots.
9949920	9950920	What is this fuckery?
9951920	9952920	And it was awesome because I fucking love those movies.
9953920	9956920	Of course, then again, I love Showgirls and that's my Halloween tradition is to watch Showgirls.
9957920	9960920	Which we did at my house and drank wine and watched Showgirls and it was great.
9961920	9963920	And Miss Monet was with us. Is she a gamer? Because we need to get her on the show. I don't think she is.
9964920	9965920	But we should have her on the show anyway.
9965920	9969920	We should. She can teach a pole dancing class during the show. Our friend Monet is a pole dancer.
9970920	9974920	I used to work with Monet, which I knew Monet before. I knew Rob and I knew Monet separately.
9975920	9979920	And then I found out that they knew each other. It's like my circle of Rob.
9980920	9984920	Because there's Kat and you guys know Mystique.
9985920	9990920	Through my, for my birthday party last year, Monet had a pole dancing class.
9990920	9994920	We talked about this in Hoard House because Extefer came to the pole dancing class and he was really good at it.
9995920	10001920	And then like this was so random. Apparently him and Monet ran into each other at like a postal service concert and they remembered each other.
10002920	10003920	The world is such a small funny place sometimes.
10004920	10008920	It is. But no, there was mention on my Facebook about doing a Cards Against Humanity session.
10009920	10010920	Good times. Alright.
10011920	10013920	Because I've been getting my 12 days of Cards Against Humanity.
10014920	10017920	Alright. This is too much talking about people that our listeners don't know. So we need to get into the effort.
10018920	10019920	We need to introduce our listeners to these people.
10020920	10021920	We need to get into the FUs of the Week.
10037920	10038920	Our Sakura, FUs of the Week.
10039920	10043920	Um, I'm good. FU to the sick. FU to the plague.
10044920	10046920	I will follow her because I have the exact same FU.
10046920	10050920	FU to the fact that I got sick, especially when I had a weekend where I actually had a bunch of stuff planned.
10051920	10055920	I was supposed to go wine tasting with friends this weekend who drove up from out of town and I couldn't fucking go.
10056920	10060920	But they did the most adorable thing for me and I just love friends.
10061920	10062920	Hugs and kisses if you guys are out there listening.
10063920	10070920	And I was supposed to go to a big holiday party with some of my friends here locally and that was supposed to be Friday night.
10071920	10074920	Couldn't go because I was sick and it's rude to go to a dinner party when you're sick and cough on all the food.
10074920	10078920	So, boo! Anyhow, uh, Loki?
10079920	10086920	I'm just FU'd to the fact that I still have to heal up for a while before I can actually eat real food.
10087920	10092920	Everybody's giving FUs tonight to conditions. It's a theme tonight.
10093920	10099920	And why not? Let's give an FU to Volition and Deep Silver for their fucking broken ass game.
10100920	10101920	Because I would like to play that.
10102920	10103920	Oh, I have another FU.
10104920	10105920	And it goes to you and Victoria.
10106920	10107920	Hey, FU.
10108920	10109920	For Frivolo.
10110920	10111920	Oh, it's great wine, isn't it?
10112920	10113920	Because I bought a bottle and normally I'm not a sweet wine person.
10114920	10117920	As I describe this to Victoria, it tastes like angels pissed in my cup.
10118920	10119920	It was amazing.
10120920	10124920	Frivolo's really good. That winery should pay me money for that endorsement.
10125920	10128920	For the record, don't buy it at Whole Foods. Go to Total Wine because it's four bucks cheaper.
10129920	10131920	Or just go to the winery. It's not far. Well, if you live here.
10131920	10134920	I've never, you've never taken me. You need to take me, Rob, next time you go.
10135920	10139920	Alright, let's see. What else do I want to say?
10140920	10141920	We've got a couple more stories for you guys.
10142920	10144920	And then Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR.
10145920	10148920	And our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio. Although, I've got to admit, I'm a little bit worried.
10149920	10150920	Bobby didn't have a single caller tonight on his show.
10151920	10154920	Are we going to get people to call into OrangeLawnsRadio? We shall see.
10155920	10157920	Coming up in a moment. But first, some quick stories here. Loki.
10157920	10173920	So the Oculus Rift is moving along. They just received 75 million dollars in funding from the venture capital firm Andressen Horowitz led by, I guess that was it, Mark Anderson.
10174920	10180920	Why does it seem like there's too many, or Andresen? There's too many letters in these words.
10181920	10182920	It's like they have extra E's in there.
10182920	10192920	Anyways, and he's the founder of Netscape. Man, I remember Netscape. That was the browser to go to before Firefox.
10193920	10196920	It was. Netscape was the bomb. Dial into Prodigy, then fire up Netscape.
10197920	10200920	You know what we used to call it back when I was on AOL because there was a big rivalry?
10201920	10204920	No, no. Prodigy, I mean. We called it Buttigy. For some reason we called it Buttigy.
10205920	10206920	That doesn't even make sense.
10207920	10209920	I know it didn't. And Netscape, by the way, was Nadscrape.
10210920	10211920	Oh, I always heard Nutscrape.
10212920	10218920	My first website was designed in Netscape. That shit was the bomb.
10219920	10228920	So anyways, apparently they liked what they saw, and I'm sure 75 million dollars in funding can only help.
10229920	10235920	They've already secured, I guess, previously 16 million dollars in the first round of funding in June.
10235920	10241920	I'm very curious to see what happens. Hopefully one day I will have an Oculus Rift myself.
10242920	10253920	Getting closer. Getting closer to this total immersion future or something.
10254920	10260920	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, on Prodigy we just called AOL AOL because that was insulting enough.
10261920	10263920	You know, I remember AOL when it was DOS.
10263920	10268920	I remember when it was free. Because they kept sending you those 30 day trials.
10269920	10274920	No, I remember having a phished account. I didn't phish it either.
10275920	10283920	I remember when AOL was Quantum Link on the Commodore 64, and I used to dial into BBS's on my 300 baud modem.
10284920	10286920	It's hardcore, bitches. Hardcore.
10286920	10291920	You know, I still have my same, when they went to where you could have your free accounts.
10292920	10298920	I actually still have the same username on my AIM from that account. It's DarkSakura.
10299920	10300920	But I hide so no one can find me.
10301920	10303920	I was going to say, wait a minute, now you're going to get tons of AOL Instant Messages.
10304920	10305920	Who uses Instant Messenger anymore?
10306920	10308920	Me and Becky and Victoria and a few people.
10309920	10312920	Most of the people I've been friends with from my old AOL days.
10312920	10318920	I didn't use Facebook Messenger either. I have a messenger that I prefer, but even then I only talk to like two people on it.
10319920	10324920	I only keep AIM up because there's maybe like a handful of people. And sometimes some of my friends from Alabama are on it.
10325920	10327920	It's all text messages now. It's kind of where people are.
10328920	10329920	Yeah, but it's easier to type.
10330920	10332920	Yeah, I understand. Alright, one more story for you guys.
10333920	10340920	And don't read too much into this, but it's very exciting to know that Nintendo has renewed the trademark for Metroid Prime.
10340920	10346920	And a lot of people are doing, you know, shaking and crying because, ooh, this means there's going to be a new Metroid Prime on Wii U.
10347920	10348920	Well, there might be. You never know.
10349920	10354920	I mean, it would certainly make a lot of sense for Retro to go and do another Metroid Prime game for the Wii U.
10355920	10358920	But we do know that the trademark was renewed on August 13, 2013.
10359920	10362920	Probably just to protect, you know, the games that already exist.
10363920	10365920	Because you know Nintendo loves to package up its old shit eventually.
10365920	10371920	And on the next Nintendo console, we'll probably have GameCube games and Wii U games, or excuse me, Wii games downloadable.
10372920	10375920	So, you know, they just want to keep that trademark out there for sure.
10376920	10378920	But wouldn't it be nice to have another Metroid Prime game?
10379920	10382920	Maybe that will be their ace in the hole at E3. We'll see.
10384920	10388920	They've got to somehow undo what Metroid does.
10389920	10392920	What was, I don't even remember the name of it now. Zero, not Zero Mission. That game was good.
10392920	10396920	I don't know what game was good. Metroid, what was the Team Ninja game? The Other M.
10397920	10400920	Even though I didn't hate Metroid Other M. I didn't think it was as bad as a lot of people do.
10401920	10405920	But it definitely felt like it was a different company's game, not a Nintendo game.
10406920	10408920	Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line.
10409920	10413920	It's open. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
10414920	10415920	You can give us a call right now if you'd like.
10416920	10420920	If there's anything you want to share or talk about maybe that we didn't bring up or something we did bring up, who knows.
10420920	10423920	Give us a call and we will talk about it.
10424920	10430920	In the meantime, I'm going to go to Twitter Topics and see if Loki has any last minute stories or Dark Sakura. Who knows?
10431920	10432920	Nope.
10433920	10435920	No, I don't really have anything at the moment.
10436920	10440920	Alright, well good thing the phone is ringing and we can actually go to some calls. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10441920	10444920	The only one with the fastest internet finger in the whole wide internet chat. It's Rama.
10445920	10447920	You're very good at this Rama. What's on your mind, buddy?
10447920	10452920	I do try. There are some topics I do want to cover real quick and I've got to be on my merry little way.
10453920	10464920	See, I feel with Loki with the whole dentist thing because once I went to... I had my three impacted teeth pulled out before I had to do an eight hour shift at work.
10465920	10466920	Oh, God.
10467920	10473920	I'm thinking, okay, get it done. Drop off the meds. Go to work. It won't be that big of a deal.
10473920	10485920	Twenty minutes into my shift, I'm like, it hurts. It hurts. Take my break. Grab the meds. I was pretty much floating on cloud nine for the next eight hours after that.
10486920	10494920	Oh my. How did you even work a shift on those? I can't believe you didn't just somehow get the day off or something. I don't know.
10495920	10505920	I have a high tolerance for pain. There was that time that I dislocated my knee and they gave me Tylenol 3. They gave me a week prescription. I only needed it for one day.
10508920	10519920	Let's see. The whole YouTube debacle about them flagging videos. That's okay. I understand. I feel those users pains because some of my videos get flagged as well.
10520920	10530920	Some of our OLR episodes that have been posted on YouTube are getting flagged and it's making me question if we should continue to do it, to be honest, because it was all a kind of experiment anyway.
10531920	10537920	But there's been a couple people that have been very vocal about their support of the YouTube posting, so I am trying to stick it out for them.
10538920	10544920	It's so very nice that they welcome us in open arms. Hey, you fucking stole that shit. Did you make that?
10545920	10548920	That's how I feel, but whatever. Anyway, sorry, Rama.
10549920	10561920	It's cool. It's cool because the issue is with my videos, the Japanese come to make the albums of Sony, EMI, and them.
10562920	10572920	They will have the videos flagged because us videographers who record masquerades, they realize we didn't get permission to use their music in the video.
10572920	10580920	And I'm like, I didn't put the song in there. It was part of the skit. It was part of the musical or whatever.
10581920	10587920	And I just put back, under fair use, leave me alone please. Worst case scenario, some countries can't see my videos.
10588920	10591920	Yeah. Still, that's so irritating to even have to go through that, you know?
10591920	10607920	The whole 38 Studios bid? I'll tell you what. I will give 38 Studios fair value for all their franchises. $20. I believe I'm being more than fair.
10608920	10614920	That's not even the price of the game. Well, maybe it is now actually. I could be wrong. It could be the price of the game now.
10615920	10616920	Exactly!
10617920	10627920	I'm just thinking there's not a lot of call out there for a sequel to Kingdoms of Amalur. Although, I know some people really liked it. It's not like I heard nothing. It's not like it was a crap game. It was decent from what I hear.
10628920	10633920	So I am. I'm actually kind of surprised no one wants the sequel rights, but I don't know. Whatever.
10634920	10635920	It's weird.
10636920	10642920	Yeah. And last thing before I get out of here. I am returning to my Pokémon roots.
10642920	10645920	Oh, you're going back to red and blue? What are you doing?
10646920	10648920	I'm playing the game again. I picked up a copy of Y.
10649920	10653920	You know what? The new 3DS games are really good. Are you having fun with it so far?
10654920	10660920	I don't know. It's still sealed. I told myself I am not unwrapping Y till I finish A Link Between Worlds.
10661920	10666920	That's fair. Because I was going to say, if you're going to sit there with an unopened copy of the game, I will sic Shana Linko on you.
10667920	10668920	Uh-uh.
10668920	10675920	By the way, I'm fairly certain that Dan's gifting me that for a holiday mess. I'm getting X.
10676920	10677920	I told him I wanted X.
10678920	10680920	So you'll have somebody to trade Pokémans with.
10681920	10689920	I only bought the game for one reason. Toys R Us had it on sale last week or last for 20 bucks. I got Best Buy at a price match it.
10690920	10691920	Here you go. It's a good deal. It's a steal for that game.
10692920	10694920	That's what I did with my Mass Effect 3. Got it for 10 bucks cheaper.
10695920	10696920	Why not?
10696920	10701920	And then everyone on my Facebook is like, can I get it for X? Can I get it for X? I'm like, I don't know. Take it in.
10702920	10709920	Ask them. They might be nice. Couple people have said, Best Buy. I was able to price match you for X as well because they're practically the same game.
10710920	10711920	Yeah, they are the same game. Pretty much.
10712920	10714920	All right, Robin. Thanks so much for the call. Appreciate it.
10715920	10716920	No problem, dude.
10717920	10718920	Take care. An Anime Jam session. Everybody listen Tuesday nights.
10719920	10720920	Oh yeah, one more thing before I get out of here.
10720920	10728920	Next week, I do believe is the 24th for our show. That's going to be our final show of the holiday before we take a break.
10729920	10736920	We will be doing the Anime Jam session. We're getting crunked Christmas Eve special.
10737920	10740920	You guys are going live on Christmas Eve? That's impressive. You guys are hardcore.
10740920	10750920	It's because we'd rather get drunk with our friends and guests than our own families because if we're with our families, we're going to drink anyway.
10751920	10758920	I love it. Unfortunately, I have plans with my own family on Christmas Eve, but if I get back in time, I'll join you all for a round.
10759920	10761920	I'm probably going to have to drink to make it through our Christmas Eve.
10762920	10763920	I know, right? I know, right? All right.
10764920	10768920	You know what? Spend Christmas with your family. Spend Christmas with the drunken bastards of Anime Jam session.
10768920	10774920	I love it. I love it. We'll have a great show, but you still have one more show before that because this week coming up is the 17th.
10775920	10779920	This week, we have a lot of stuff coming up and then that following week, all bets are off.
10780920	10787920	All bets are off. You know what? This week is the Hoard House Holiday Special and I'm going to tell you, it's a doozy. Hold on to your butts.
10788920	10792920	Well, I have one thing to say about that. May the fierce be with you.
10793920	10795920	Okay. All right. Talk to you later.
10796920	10797920	All right. Bye.
10798920	10802920	Have a good day. All right. Actually, wait. Rama doesn't like Beyoncé. Oh, well.
10803920	10805920	1877 Game O.L.R.
10806920	10807920	May the Jesus be with you.
10808920	10815920	Or use your name on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word. Again, that's 1877 Game O.L.R. or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
10816920	10818920	Let's go to the phones. I think we have another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10819920	10820920	This is Reginator.
10821920	10822920	Hey, Reginator. How you doing?
10823920	10824920	Pretty good.
10824920	10840920	Well, two things. I was going to do kind of a rant about the whole YouTube group. Since that's going to take a little while, I just want to get the quick thing out of the way.
10841920	10847920	Since I'm feeling a little generous, I'm going to do a little game giveaway. A Steam game.
10848920	10863920	Yeah. In fact, this weekend, since it was a Steam sale on DinoDA, where the game was basically $2 for a single copy or four-pack for $6, I can't figure what the hell.
10864920	10867920	Pick up the four-pack, keep a copy for myself, giveaway dollars.
10868920	10870920	He's Santinator tonight. Tonight he's Santinator.
10871920	10880920	So, I can't figure what the hell. Giveaway is one of the copies of the game tonight on O.R.
10881920	10896920	And what we'll do is, well, I'm going to ask a person directly in chance that way you guys don't get an unfair advantage because of the delay.
10897920	10908920	And the first person that answers the question directly, go ahead and shout the answer out in text in chat.
10909920	10911920	And we'll get the game.
10912920	10914920	Alright. Then you post that question in chat.
10915920	10916920	And I'm posting it right now.
10917920	10925920	Alright. Giveaway question. On Steam and according to record, what is my most played game in my total play time? Please list the game's full correct title.
10926920	10932920	I'm going to let the chatters have it, but I'm almost positive I know what it is. Does it have to do with cards?
10935920	10936920	I can't say.
10937920	10939920	Alright. I think it does. There's your hint.
10940920	10948920	So, you wanted to rant a little bit on the YouTube thing. Now, I'm going to ask you to try to keep it a little bit concise because we do want to end the show at a reasonable hour.
10949920	10950920	But what's your thoughts on the YouTube thing?
10950920	10962920	Alright. Here's the thing. On one hand, I know that companies be it Nintendo or Valve or Microsoft, whoever, yeah, they would like to protect their IPs.
10963920	10975920	That's understandable. But at the same time, you know, fans be it Bobby Blackwell, yourself, me, whoever, we like these games.
10976920	10982920	We want to support games. And we want to promote the games.
10983920	10996920	What we do is show off these games. And we're effectively giving these games free publicity. We're doing PR for these games.
10997920	11006920	And the game manufacturers are not paying us one representative for this promotion.
11006920	11016920	Let me ask you this. I'm going to interrupt you real quick just to ask a tough question because, you know, yes, we're giving the games free publicity, but doesn't a game maker have a right to say, I don't want that publicity?
11017920	11032920	No, that's one way of looking at it. I didn't look at it that way or consider it. But at the same time, I can't figure out why a company would want free publicity for the game.
11032920	11041920	Because I already mentioned that assuming that the game isn't crap, you know, they want publicity for the games because usually they'll garner extra sales.
11041920	11056920	Like Casey Point, earlier this year, Bobby Blackwell on Twitch, he had showed off Sacred Citadel, which is the go forth and conquer game.
11057920	11069920	And I saw the stream and I liked the game, bought the game. So what was it, Deep Silver that put the game out? They made $15 off the game because of that stream.
11069920	11077920	So, I mean, but that is a testimony to when it works. But, you know, so I guess a company does have the right to say they don't want to do it.
11078920	11084920	But the thing that really irks me about the whole thing, Raginator, are the people, I mean, if the gaming company puts in the injunction, that's one thing.
11085920	11090920	Fine. Nintendo doesn't want their games to have monetized YouTubes or they want the money or whatever. Fine. That's their prerogative.
11090920	11098920	But it's when you have these other websites like ForGamer or Machinima or whatever, and they're the ones that I get content ID matched with.
11099920	11108920	That's not right because that wasn't their, it wasn't their stuff to content match in the first place. It wasn't their game. You know what I mean?
11109920	11116920	Yeah. All right. Raginator, I got to let you go. Let us know, though, in chat who ends up winning that code and we will talk to you later.
11117920	11118920	All right. Have a nice night.
11119920	11126920	You too. All right. 1-877. I always love the generosity of the listeners, too, to be giving away codes and stuff like that. Good luck.
11127920	11132920	Although, I kind of think Dark Tetsuya said what I would have said, so I kind of think he's going to win it, but we'll see.
11133920	11137920	1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call.
11137920	11146920	Let's see. Going to some of the tweets that we got tonight. Retertainment sent us a tweet that we did touch on earlier in the show, but just to mention it again.
11147920	11153920	The Read Only Memories Kickstarter got funded. Yay! And I noticed MidBoss Games even retweeted our tweet that we were going live tonight.
11154920	11158920	So they're supporting us just like we supported. You guys rule! You guys rule.
11159920	11160920	I'm feeling the love.
11160920	11168920	I am feeling the love. Just you wait for GamerX, too. The whole lot of you are getting glomped. Right, DarkSakura?
11169920	11170920	If I get to go.
11171920	11173920	All right, you will. All right. We'll make it work out.
11174920	11176920	So, Rob, you have to cosplay with me.
11177920	11182920	Oh, God. Okay. If I lose 20 pounds, then I will cosplay with you.
11183920	11185920	That's not going to happen.
11186920	11187920	Fuck you!
11188920	11190920	I had to go there. No. Rob.
11191920	11192920	Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery.
11193920	11197920	No. It can happen, but I would invite you to go to the gym with me.
11198920	11199920	You know I go to the other gym.
11200920	11201920	I know you do, but I can get you into my gym.
11202920	11206920	All right, anyway. We'll talk later about that. Meanwhile, we got some tweets.
11207920	11210920	Trust me, if my fat ass could lose 20 pounds, you could do it easy.
11211920	11213920	No fat shaming. We shouldn't fat shame ourselves.
11214920	11215920	No, but I can say I'm fat if I want to.
11215920	11216920	No, but I saw that video this week, but anyway.
11217920	11218920	You know what?
11219920	11224920	I just, I feel for health reasons, I feel, I know I can be better, have a better body than the one I'm at.
11225920	11227920	You know what? As long as you love you.
11228920	11230920	I know I can do, I do love me, but I know I can do better.
11231920	11232920	All right, anyway.
11233920	11235920	Moving on. Awkward talk!
11236920	11237920	Moving on. We have some tweets.
11237920	11238920	We have some tweets.
11239920	11246920	Guy trollingly applies to a college football coaching job, citing his years of Madden and NCAAF playing.
11249920	11254920	Do you think that we would be eligible for a job at a gaming company just because we did this podcast?
11256920	11259920	I will actually, I will say, and I think I've talked about this on the show.
11260920	11264920	I'm not going to tell you who, but twice I've applied for positions with gaming companies.
11264920	11273920	One of them I actually was really close with and I decided to, because I would have had to relocate and I would have had to stop doing the show and everything else.
11274920	11275920	I decided to not go forward with it.
11276920	11278920	And I'm not going to tell you who it was, but you guys know I am a corporate teacher.
11279920	11280920	That's what I do during the day.
11281920	11282920	It was a corporate teaching job with a video game company.
11283920	11284920	That's cool.
11285920	11286920	And it would have been really cool.
11287920	11291920	And it was just the relocation kind of like, I couldn't do it because of where they wanted me to go, you know, would have been tough.
11291920	11301920	But, um, yeah, so, um, but yeah, I mean like, you know, but, but does the fact that we do a podcast mean we should work for video game companies?
11302920	11303920	Not necessarily.
11304920	11307920	Well, I mean, if it's graphic design than that for you, that's good.
11308920	11312920	Yeah, Loki does sales, you know, so, you know, maybe that type of stuff would be good for him.
11313920	11316920	I would love to do design for like digital manuals and that type of thing.
11316920	11321920	SSG 100 Matt says, I've cited OLR in a job interview once. Didn't get the job. Sorry to hear it.
11322920	11328920	I have had, I've used people for references though. Um, as, uh, as people have listed Orange Lawns Radio as job.
11329920	11331920	Didn't you do that dark soccer? You put OLR down and me as a professional contact.
11332920	11340920	I put OLR down, um, well, you were already one of my references, but I put OLR down as a client for freelance design.
11341920	11342920	And I put myself down as art director for VOG.
11343920	11345920	I have used it as a example of management skills.
11346920	11348920	Doing this show and keeping you two in line. I'm just kidding.
11349920	11351920	We all, we all help each other out to be honest.
11352920	11355920	All right. Uh, let's see. I had one other tweet here I wanted to read.
11356920	11365920	Yes, it was from Eric RPG sent us a tweet and, uh, it was just a link over to a Kickstarter for Grapple Knight is another Kickstarter.
11366920	11367920	So I'm assuming this is a Kickstarter he's behind.
11368920	11373920	It's a 2D platformer that pays tribute to the golden age of Super Nintendo.
11373920	11379920	Sounds good to me. There's a lot of these, uh, Grapple Knight is, uh, something he wanted to give a shout out for on Kickstarter.
11380920	11384920	So check that out. Um, let's see. Just trying to see if there's any other tweets.
11385920	11391920	Oh, I want to mention this. Uh, we're going to get her back on the show for sure at some point, but do you remember?
11392920	11399920	Yeah. Do you remember our buddy? She came on the show right after it was announced she was going to be on the tester three.
11399920	11405920	Our buddy Oscar was on the show. Now she was funny enough. We didn't know this. She called in just out of the blue.
11406920	11408920	We didn't arrange the interview or anything. She knew a listener of the shows.
11409920	11412920	I hope Stan's still listening if he's out there. Thank you for hooking that up.
11413920	11417920	But, uh, she called into the show one night and it happened to be the week before she got kicked off the tester three.
11418920	11421920	Yes. She was very cool, but she was very cool. We had a lot of fun with her. We'll get this.
11421920	11430920	She's on the King of the Nerds season two. And I'm like, girl, I know you can't talk about if you won or lost the thing. I understand that.
11431920	11438920	But I'm like, win or lose, you have been on the tester and King of the Nerds. You are the nerdiest reality show contestant of all time.
11439920	11448920	So anyway, I just thought that was hilarious that she's on that show now. So we'll have her back to talk about that, which sounds like Rama saying, fuck King of the Nerds.
11448920	11455920	Well, he'll be really excited for that interview then. Retertainment says she's on actual TV. Yes. Crazy, huh?
11456920	11460920	So anyway, uh, let's see other stuff I wanted to mention.
11461920	11471920	Uh, Peaker Uno tweeted the show and said, I missed last week's topic, but one of my favorite TV programs was Nightmare, a virtual reality RPG game show in the nineties.
11472920	11473920	I remember that kind of.
11474920	11477920	That's awesome. Anyhow, uh, I don't think we're getting any other calls.
11478920	11481920	So that's a little by, yeah, I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
11482920	11486920	I have one last bit of, uh, go ahead and then we'll close up shop for tonight. Um, so this is pretty exciting.
11487920	11495920	I've been actually waiting for this to happen. Duke Nukem 3d Megaton edition has now added steam workshop support and a level editor.
11496920	11497920	Wait, does it have multiplayer play yet online?
11498920	11504920	Um, I'm assuming if it has the level, I'm surprised it doesn't fit already. But, uh, anyways, yeah, there's a bombshell announcement.
11504920	11509920	I could use 60 maps for download already and they're adding their own rating system and mini forum.
11510920	11515920	And the game's also 75% off until tomorrow, which means I'm going to buy that right now.
11516920	11518920	Oh my God. I just realized something. I have to check drunken robot pornography.
11519920	11522920	Why? See if they've updated because remember I've still been playing the alpha.
11523920	11525920	That's right. Uh, me too with, um, uh, audio surf too.
11526920	11529920	There's been getting little updates here and there. So, uh,
11529920	11531920	I've got my steam cards I can buy.
11532920	11535920	Yeah, I think by the game mean it's only $2 and 49 cents.
11536920	11537920	Is it really? It's only $2 and 49 cents.
11538920	11539920	Ooh, that's a good one. That's a good one.
11540920	11543920	All right. Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem 3d together, $3 and 74 cents.
11544920	11548920	Tempting, tempting. All right. Um, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry video.
11549920	11552920	Thank you guys so much for listening to us stay in here for the whole show, uh, the whole way through for us.
11553920	11556920	I hope we could entertain you during your day with our chatter about video games.
11556920	11560920	Um, wherever you're listening to us, whether you're here live Sunday night, just chilling with our show,
11561920	11564920	or, uh, if you're listening to us on your commute or at your work day on Monday, uh,
11565920	11567920	thank you so much for taking the time out to listen to Orange Laundry radio and supporting the show.
11568920	11573920	Support independent broadcasting. There's so many hardworking people like us out there that do this just for the love of it.
11574920	11576920	Please go forth and download lots of indie podcasts.
11577920	11581920	Remember word of mouth is key to the success of this show because there's so many, uh,
11581920	11587920	so many of these big corporate podcasts that have much money in their pockets that can buy the promotion and so forth.
11588920	11593920	We can't do that. So all we ask if you enjoy the show, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word.
11594920	11598920	They're not as cute as us. No, they're not. They're not. We're very, super adorable. Absolutely.
11599920	11604920	We are the, we are the most prettiest. Um, thank you guys once again for checking out the show.
11604920	11610920	Uh, leave a nice review. If you wouldn't mind saying a nice word on iTunes reviews, that'd be great.
11611920	11616920	Or a Stitcher reviews are hugely helpful too. Uh, I directly attribute the increase we've had, uh,
11617920	11620920	in our exposure on Stitcher to those of you that taken the time to write the reviews. So thank you so much.
11621920	11625920	And, um, I don't know what else to say. Thank you guys again for, for listening.
11626920	11629920	You guys are great and have a great holiday season. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
11630920	11632920	Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight.
11632920	11633920	You have another game to play now.
11635920	11636920	What's that? Duke Nukem or?
11637920	11639920	Actually, it's two games. Duke Nukem and Shadow Warrior.
11640920	11645920	All right. We'll work on it. Uh, my final thought for tonight is I may just have to get that Grand Theft Auto 5 on sale.
11646920	11649920	I think Loki might have finally broke me. We'll see. Uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.
11650920	11653920	It wouldn't let me, um, buy you a fractal on my Steam app, so I have to do it when I get home.
11654920	11655920	Aw, shucks.
11656920	11657920	But you're worth the $7.
11658920	11659920	That's always nice.
11659920	11664920	I love you more than Loki. He only spent $3 on you. I spent $7. Hi.
11665920	11670920	Wait, what? $3? I spent $3 on me? What are you talking about?
11671920	11675920	See? I would have gotten you fractal if you didn't already have it.
11678920	11681920	Leave us reviews that are nice and sweet because we're cute.
11682920	11683920	That's right.
11684920	11687920	Uh, to paraphrase, um, we're O.L.R. and we're pretty. How's that?
11687920	11692920	Alright, well thank you guys again. And Bobby too. Have a wonderful week. Bobby is especially pretty.
11693920	11699920	All the VOG shows, dammit. We're all pretty. And all the indie shows you listen to. I mean, there's lots of great ones out there.
11700920	11704920	I know a lot of you support various indie shows. I know a lot of you listen to the shows over on All Games.
11705920	11712920	They would love to have your support with Stitcher Reviews as well. I know a lot of you, maybe like Gamer Tag Radio and some of these shows that have been on, like, ages like we have.
11713920	11714920	They all appreciate the support.
11714920	11720920	By the way, I'm just throwing it out there. I'm actually planning on doing a Let's Draw series.
11721920	11723920	And what would that be? You just draw?
11724920	11733920	Well, pretty much. I get votes for a character that someone wants to see me draw and I will do one once a month and give it away as a freebie.
11734920	11737920	That'd be fun. Little community. Gather around.
11738920	11742920	So instead of a Let's Play, it's a Let's Draw. And I don't have to worry about people breathing on my shit.
11742920	11746920	She's just like Bob Ross, but they're bitchy little clouds.
11749920	11753920	You know what? Actually, you know what? That came up in my oil painting class last week?
11754920	11757920	I was like, I can't be like Bob Ross. My clouds are a little angrier than his.
11758920	11761920	And he's like, so are they fussy little clouds? I'm like, yes, they are. They're fussy.
11762920	11769920	All right. Well, we hope you and your bitchy little clouds have a wonderful week. We'll see you next week. Same bat time, same bat channel here at Orange Lounge Radio. Good night, everybody.
