1
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:12,020
[SPEAKER_12]: I am Loki!

2
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:32,850
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

3
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:01,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

4
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:01,792
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

5
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:03,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Educated.

6
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:04,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Educated.

7
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,354
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you know.

8
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:07,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you read a book today?

9
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:10,038
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I've been watching documentaries all week.

10
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:12,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what LeVar Burton taught me growing up.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:12,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look.

12
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,521
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a book.

13
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:14,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Reading Rainbow.

14
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

15
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been watching documentaries all week.

16
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:17,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

17
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,325
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been very interesting.

18
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:25,830
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first got Netflix, or I should say, well, when Netflix was first out, it was only the DVDs, right?

19
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I first got the Netflix streaming, whenever that was, it was a couple years ago, right?

20
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:29,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

21
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:33,898
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first things I did is I binged-watched documentaries.

22
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:44,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through that phase, too, because Netflix streaming doesn't always have a lot of the current stuff, but they have a lot of the really low-budget documentaries and stuff, so it's a great thing to binge on.

23
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:47,795
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually YouTube channels now that are all documentaries.

24
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:50,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been watching a series called Extraordinary People.

25
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:53,762
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a few years ago in the UK.

26
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:57,427
[SPEAKER_09]: And they really, really, really like autistic savants.

27
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:00,390
[SPEAKER_09]: But they meet people all over the world.

28
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,251
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually really cool.

29
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:03,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of surgery ones too.

30
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:05,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Like people with odd growths on their face.

31
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:10,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of British, I noticed that Netflix, and this is like a paid advertisement for them.

32
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:11,676
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get paid.

33
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:12,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay us, Netflix.

34
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:14,618
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no little code we have or anything.

35
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:20,402
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have a lot of BBC and British programming on there, I noticed that too, which is pretty awesome.

36
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:24,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not insult Reading Rainbow by applying My Little Pony to it.

37
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:25,848
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you looking at?

38
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:26,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Our chat room?

39
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:26,909
[SPEAKER_09]: That's deft.

40
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:29,230
[SPEAKER_02]: At live.vognetwork.com.

41
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you can join us in our chat.

42
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,071
[SPEAKER_02]: What did Actdeft say there?

43
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Reading Rainbow dash.

44
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:34,231
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

45
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:36,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Live.vognetwork.com.

46
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:41,834
[SPEAKER_02]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

47
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:45,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Also joining us here in studio tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

48
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:45,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

49
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:46,796
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Loki?

50
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:47,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing fine.

51
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:48,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, awesome.

52
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:55,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's a little parlor game that some of our chatters like to play, which is what food did Loki bring to the show tonight?

53
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:57,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And an old favorite returns tonight.

54
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen you bring this in like six months, but what did you bring to the show tonight?

55
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:01,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Triple bacon pizza.

56
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Triple bacon pizza!

57
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:05,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for the heart.

58
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:07,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Low in sodium.

59
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:07,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

60
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,078
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, amazing.

61
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:09,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll enjoy it.

62
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:16,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Also joining us in the studio tonight as he has been on and off since Thanksgiving because he's spending the holidays in the area.

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,121
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not give it up for VXJasonXV!

64
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:26,483
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure everybody's very surprised to hear my voice again, but always great to be here as usual.

65
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:27,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And always nice to have you.

66
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:29,563
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a Jason for the holidays.

67
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,904
[SPEAKER_12]: It's my Christmas present to everybody.

68
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:35,233
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's always great to have you.

69
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,795
[SPEAKER_02]: The more people in the studio, the merrier.

70
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,737
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, unfortunately, you don't get a lot.

71
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:42,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great if we were all in San Francisco or something where a lot of people kind of come through.

72
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:45,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, make you losers drive an hour and a half to get down there to me.

73
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:50,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in Sacramento, it's a little harder to get the people up here to actually sit in studio with us.

74
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know...

75
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:52,392
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

76
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:11,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, isn't that hilarious how cold, I'm using my quoting fingers, how cold it is right now?

77
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:12,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

78
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:15,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like I tell people, you know, or like when it rains.

79
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,732
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, DarkSakura loves to say, California, you guys don't know the rain.

80
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to spend some time in the south where it really rains or, you know, what have you.

81
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:25,176
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the rains in South Africa?

82
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:26,237
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the rains in Spain?

83
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:26,777
[SPEAKER_02]: The rains in South Africa?

84
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:27,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It falls mainly on the plains.

85
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:28,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Toto.

86
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

87
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

88
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:57,740
[SPEAKER_02]: for the record the weather right now is like February in Alabama well I was gonna say though one thing to keep in mind we're not built for certain things like if it were to rain here like it is in the south we'd all be underwater we'd be part of the ocean right and now all of your houses would fall over and say and with the cold you know we have we have like outdoor pipes and stuff here is very common and when it gets really houses made out of plywood yeah wrap your pipes bring your pets in because it's just not normal here so

89
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I will take the earth shaking randomly under my feet any day

90
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:22,364
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's 36 degrees here right now.

91
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:25,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this when we play Guess What It Is in Colorado right now?

92
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:27,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Negative 20, I'm sure.

93
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Close.

94
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,172
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it feels like.

95
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:29,413
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

96
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:33,338
[SPEAKER_12]: It is currently 9 degrees and will be 1 degree before the show is over.

97
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:33,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

98
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:38,578
[SPEAKER_02]: WhatUpG and Chad at live.vognetwork.com says, I love the Snow Bowl games today.

99
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:43,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we talk a lot about sports ball here on OLR, but I got to say, I actually saw some of that game today.

100
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:44,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

101
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw some footballs today.

102
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was hardcore that they were out there playing in the snow.

103
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the type of thing where you can't even see the damn lines.

104
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:56,381
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to project the lines out there because you can't even see them because of the damn snow.

105
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:57,642
[SPEAKER_14]: They're paid employees.

106
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:59,562
[SPEAKER_14]: They better play in any kind of condition.

107
00:05:59,582 --> 00:05:59,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

108
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:02,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, Rob, you were a band geek, so how about this?

109
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:05,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Marching competition in the snow.

110
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:12,248
[SPEAKER_02]: We never had the snow, but we had to do field show once in the pouring rain and so many of us slipped and fell.

111
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:15,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I slipped and fell in a mud thing, but you just get right back up and keep going.

112
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:22,853
[SPEAKER_09]: The last marching band competition I did was in Prattville, Alabama, which, Prattville, and it was in the snow.

113
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:24,354
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were all

114
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And you had all the clarinet players that had the fingers cut out of their gloves.

115
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you play clarinet?

116
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:32,067
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Jamie played saxophone.

117
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:33,508
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

118
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:37,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, we could talk band geek stories all night, but it is a video gaming show.

119
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get back to the topic of video games at hand.

120
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:41,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight's kickoff topic.

121
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki is actually going to start us off with our kickoff topic tonight.

122
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:46,620
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something a lot of people on Twitter and everything's been talking about.

123
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure some of you are wondering when we were going to bring it up.

124
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:49,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you go.

125
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:57,010
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to talk a little bit about the VGX award show thing that they had yesterday on Spike.

126
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,113
[SPEAKER_14]: It was also streamed on Twitch and all that fun stuff.

127
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of interesting things coming out of that.

128
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:07,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Mostly just some new trailers for things.

129
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Announcements of...

130
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:11,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things we'll get into later in the show.

131
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:39,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that trailer because I did not watch the VGX, and I kind of always said, I'm like, any of the good stuff will be on YouTube afterwards.

132
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:40,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

133
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:45,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see that trailer, and it was neat, but I was like, well, what's the game?

134
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:53,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked neat how it was going from underwater to land to sky to space in just one fluid motion, and the art style was very neat.

135
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:56,387
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I was kind of like, oh, this is neat, but is it a shooter?

136
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:58,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I see bullets being counted in the corner.

137
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:00,229
[SPEAKER_02]: What the heck game is it?

138
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:17,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know yeah that's the only thing that kind of gets me about it is I'm like alright cool story bro what's the game it just looks interesting yeah I look forward to the next chapter and what this game's like I'm not dissing the game it looked really good but I just I'm curious you know well okay what else is there

139
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:30,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, okay, so basically the main thing about this is there's been a lot of conflicting opinions about the show since this is kind of a whole change of venue for the VGAs.

140
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:39,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it's this new, there's no audience really, it's just kind of this studio set and they have developers on, they're interviewing them with different things.

141
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:46,333
[SPEAKER_14]: To me it seemed like a very long version of their game trailer show that they normally have on Spike and

142
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:58,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Except, you know, they gave out awards and they had Joel McHale and a lot of people didn't like Joel McHale because they thought he was just, you know, hating on the entire show and not taking anything seriously.

143
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:04,457
[SPEAKER_14]: And which, I mean, if you're a paid presenter, I don't think that he's doing that on purpose.

144
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,898
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just schtick, but whatever.

145
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:06,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

146
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:33,397
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know he made some major faux pas as well that should be called out like he and to some people you may go oh it's the big deal but you know again if you're trying to break out of that whole machismo you know gaming culture and it's only for a certain type of people especially coming off last week when we had a guest that was really talking about inclusive games you know Joe McHale made a pretty off joke in the first 10 minutes of the show something about Wario getting a sex change

147
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:47,245
[SPEAKER_02]: which can be construed as transphobic which you know I realize there's a fine line between are we too sensitive about getting offended easily and you know and so forth but it's just kind of the thing where it's like

148
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:58,809
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a joke like that kind of just leaves me very sourpuss face when we're all about trying to include more people in gaming culture.

149
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get away from gaming being just about dude bros and that sort of thing.

150
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:05,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

151
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:09,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Spike TV feels some sort of allegiance to that demographic.

152
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:10,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

153
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:16,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I didn't watch it, but I heard about it, and I just kind of made a sour face.

154
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:31,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, some of the things that he said were kind of ironic, I guess, because the whole thing, he's like, yeah, we're going to have lots of trailers and demos and basically stuff that you can consider one long, giant video game commercial or something.

155
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:31,618
[SPEAKER_14]: And

156
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:35,821
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that's supposed to be a joke, but at the same time, that's kind of what this is.

157
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:39,523
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a big fucking commercial for these games.

158
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:45,306
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why the whole thing kind of seems like a joke in the first place, if you want to say even more of a joke than the VGAs were.

159
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:48,968
[SPEAKER_14]: At least the VGAs, it was actually presented like an awards show, and...

160
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:50,548
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

161
00:11:11,323 --> 00:11:26,174
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like if someone had a bigger budget out there and just filmed themselves talking about what they think is the best games, even though I know they had an internet poll to nail down some of those winners and stuff.

162
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:28,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, I don't know.

163
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't really take it seriously.

164
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask this question, then.

165
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:37,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we, as a gaming culture, I mean, these things only have enough clout and power as we give it.

166
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we continue, and I'm even accusing ourselves here.

167
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:42,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we even talking about it?

168
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is gaming culture obsessed with this show?

169
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:48,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Spike TV clearly wrote it off.

170
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:50,146
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd rather air cops reruns.

171
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:54,868
[SPEAKER_14]: People are more obsessed about the show because of the exclusive trailers and stuff that they show off.

172
00:11:54,968 --> 00:12:07,373
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically the new stuff that we get to see that people, I don't think really a lot of people, aside from getting an affirmation that, hey, X series that I like got an award or something like that.

173
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:12,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, I'm justified in my liking this series or something or complaining about that.

174
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:19,658
[SPEAKER_14]: The general video game culture conflict between different people and opinions and stuff like that.

175
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:24,142
[SPEAKER_14]: But for me, that's kind of one of the reasons I would tune in is just because of the new trailers.

176
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:29,548
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I know I could just watch them online, which I was going to do, but I just saw that there was a link to stream.

177
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:31,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, I didn't know they were streaming that online.

178
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:36,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I checked out about 10 minutes of it, and thankfully saw that trailer for No Man's Sky.

179
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:39,337
[SPEAKER_14]: My son was watching, too, and he's like, I want to see that trailer again.

180
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:40,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to see that trailer again.

181
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me get a couple comments here, Jamie.

182
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:48,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was just thinking that part of me wonders how much of it is driven by sponsors.

183
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:56,845
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're getting X amount of revenue dollars, then they have a continued reason to keep doing it in whatever way they want to as long as they keep getting the money in, right?

184
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:58,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.

185
00:12:58,967 --> 00:12:59,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Jason?

186
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:04,493
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just going to say it's the leaving sports ball on in the background to watch the commercials effect.

187
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:33,992
[SPEAKER_12]: so you think a lot of people were watching it very passively where it's like well it's a Saturday there's nothing better award shows are long and there's enough like it's it's something that you don't necessarily have to see just until you have to so you can you can glean a lot of information by having it on and having it around in lieu of doing something else but then as soon as they talk about a studio that you really enjoy or a game you're chomping at the bit to see more content of it's like okay now I'm gonna pay attention I'm gonna I'm going to give my active attention to this instead of my passive attention

188
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:49,903
[SPEAKER_14]: And also the thing, you know, kind of represents, you know, a lot of people think Jeff is kind of a corporate sellout, you know, especially with the whole Doritos and, you know, Mountain Dew thing and they have him, you know, dress up like the Mountain Dew Pope and stuff or, you know, Doritos Pope and stuff.

189
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:54,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this is almost like an example of, you know, corporate sellout type of thing.

190
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:57,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say something that actually might surprise some people.

191
00:13:57,848 --> 00:14:05,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to defend him a little bit because I kind of think at his core, he is really not a sellout.

192
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:12,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think at his core, he really is a gamer like you and me, you know, wanting to do a job out there.

193
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:16,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to some extent what's happened is...

194
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either this or nothing.

195
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:21,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he kind of realizes that.

196
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:26,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, in some ways, I think this was kind of a last-ditch effort to kind of save this sort of thing on Spike.

197
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's be real.

198
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't on TV.

199
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:33,106
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing was on its way out the door of broadcast TV or whatever.

200
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:34,267
[SPEAKER_02]: However they want to spin it,

201
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:37,708
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is they showed cops reruns instead.

202
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:50,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of think at his core he wants to do good things, but unfortunately there's only so much those sponsor people in the suits and the people that are so out of touch with this are willing to go.

203
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:59,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that's why he was open to the idea of turning to the internet and trying to let it sort of go a new direction and so forth.

204
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So I give him credit for that.

205
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:05,899
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, it's kind of one of those, this was your chance and you blew it!

206
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:07,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here's the thing.

207
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that it... Why is everyone so situated on the fact that this stuff needs to be on TV?

208
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:16,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Most people nowadays, especially in the gaming community, don't watch a lot of TV.

209
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,282
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all about internet stuff now.

210
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:21,003
[SPEAKER_14]: All internet broadcast shows.

211
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:26,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell, you have people that used to be on TV, like Adam Sessler, doing web shows now.

212
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:28,845
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that he could easily...

213
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:29,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

214
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:48,272
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I think they need to do.

215
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:52,276
[SPEAKER_14]: There is definitely a way out of it's not this or nothing.

216
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:54,118
[SPEAKER_14]: There's plenty of options out there.

217
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,541
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just they try to do it again.

218
00:15:57,162 --> 00:16:04,749
[SPEAKER_14]: And props to Spike for at least still considering gaming as a viable thing to have on their network because fuck, G4 just gave up on that.

219
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:05,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

220
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:10,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go to the chatroom because there's a lot of comments on this, of course, in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

221
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice after all.

222
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says, again, take out Joel and it would have been fine.

223
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackwolf says, I like what they tried to do, but they needed to do it, not try.

224
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:24,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet, again, that's a little bit of the battle between the suits and so forth.

225
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:29,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Bobby also goes on to say, you know, Jeff has done some amazing journalism stuff.

226
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:32,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff's The Final Hours reporting is wonderful.

227
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:34,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot, I don't know a lot of people that would argue with that.

228
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:36,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly, that's why it's kind of a disappointment.

229
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:38,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, his game trailer show's good.

230
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:41,573
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I have nothing, nothing bad to say about that.

231
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:42,253
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a great show.

232
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:48,499
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's just, it's kind of embarrassing that he's this good and yet here's this.

233
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a couple other comments that are really deep and this is really good stuff.

234
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:57,886
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, and this is in response to why do these awards even exist and so forth.

235
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:03,270
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, because we're a society that needs a winner and a loser in something.

236
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:08,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Award shows in general give people validation that their favorite thing is better than other people's favorite thing.

237
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:11,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Be damned if that doesn't hit the nail on the head.

238
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:30,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and it's not even just that.

239
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially Western culture.

240
00:17:32,543 --> 00:17:34,224
[SPEAKER_02]: The Oscars, right?

241
00:17:34,324 --> 00:17:42,386
[SPEAKER_02]: People get obsessed with being able to call the Oscar pool or whatever at work and that whole thing.

242
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just a part of culture.

243
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:45,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

244
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:46,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially in gaming.

245
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:51,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox One fanboys versus Sony fanboys versus Nintendo fanboys.

246
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,049
[SPEAKER_02]: That absolutely goes on.

247
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you've got other people who just laugh at them.

248
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:57,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

249
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in our chat room.

250
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:06,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually going to say, but even that in and of itself is sort of a... Some people sort of get on their high horse about not being competitive.

251
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:07,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

252
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:08,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

253
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:10,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is... I mean, you have to have a little fun with it.

254
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:14,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's... You don't want it to be the kind of thing where, oh, everybody wins an award.

255
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:21,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm the kind of guy that owns every console and I give everybody a fair opportunity.

256
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:21,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

257
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:24,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like their income.

258
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:30,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan and I used to be in that boat, and now we're kind of like we don't care anymore.

259
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:36,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, seriously, if I was making an income that he's probably making on that show, I would wear a fucking Doritos Pope hat.

260
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,857
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care on TV.

261
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:40,497
[SPEAKER_14]: I will sell out.

262
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:43,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Akuma JP says, my milkshake is better than yours.

263
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:45,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you teach me?

264
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:46,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you have to charge?

265
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,719
[SPEAKER_12]: I have more boys in the yard.

266
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:52,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that, Jason.

267
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:54,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Another one just sprouted up.

268
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:58,779
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're editing this week's show, be sure to crop out that little sentence.

269
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,380
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

270
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,002
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I really want to read this serious comment from Scottatron because this is important, too, in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

271
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:05,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Scottatron says,

272
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:15,167
[SPEAKER_02]: just dumb if you ask me.

273
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:20,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I had that criticism when I came back from GamerX.

274
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:29,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a few choice words to say about one of the monologues that I saw Pandora Box give, who, you know, she kind of made a lot of those jokes too.

275
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:35,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay, Pandora, you might be at like a GLBTQI, that whole thing, quilt bag or whatever it is.

276
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:39,536
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be at one of these types of conventions, but it's also a gaming convention.

277
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:41,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get up here and offend gamers either.

278
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:42,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was something I...

279
00:19:43,237 --> 00:19:43,898
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

280
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:24,477
[SPEAKER_02]: but Ranma counters with this it says if geeks can't make fun of themselves then what the fuck are we but I don't know I I think it's a little bit different when it is someone that you count on to do it appropriately yeah I agree and I don't agree like I do agree we have to be able to get offended a little bit and that's why I'm not here raging more about some of this but it's kind of like one of those things like okay the you're living in your basement shit is old it's old joke

281
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:27,579
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like these jokes we've heard before.

282
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:32,782
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like someone named Richard and someone calling him dick is like, ah, yeah, I've never heard that before.

283
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:34,924
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's very sex.

284
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:39,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Sex change joke is just like you can do better.

285
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:40,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tacky.

286
00:20:40,187 --> 00:20:41,108
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do better than that.

287
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:44,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, especially in this day and age, like you're smarter than that.

288
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:51,119
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, if you're going to go for the insulting jokes to be fun, to be funny, go from the Lampanelli page.

289
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:54,941
[SPEAKER_09]: But don't, you know, don't think that you're actually being funny.

290
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:58,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Go look at South Park, because I think that shit's really funny.

291
00:20:58,503 --> 00:21:01,465
[SPEAKER_02]: But granted, they offend everybody, and it's just... Anyway.

292
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,546
[SPEAKER_02]: That show has gotten incredibly stupid.

293
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:07,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, the last few episodes were pretty good.

294
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:08,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, um...

295
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, so whatever.

296
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, again, I'm not like, oh my god, I'm so mad about the VGX.

297
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:16,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not mad about the VGX by any means.

298
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at.

299
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:22,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm literally asking the question where I'm like, why is this such a big fucking deal?

300
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:31,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of disappointed that there wasn't anything like a Fallout 4 trailer, and it was just like, hey, here's a new trailer for Titanfall.

301
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,024
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish there was more new game announcements.

302
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,326
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just kind of like new trailers for games that we've already seen.

303
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:49,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, we're at the halfway point between E3s, too, so I think there is definitely a drive out there, a call for a winter E3 type of thing, and I think the Video Game Awards or VGX or whatever.

304
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,131
[SPEAKER_02]: A winter E3?

305
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:51,472
[SPEAKER_02]: A winter E3?

306
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:52,132
[SPEAKER_14]: A winter E3?

307
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably shouldn't ask this question but it just kind of sprang to mind listening to this

308
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:44,285
[SPEAKER_02]: collectively the four of us are we out of touch no Jason because we're gamers and this is this is this is something we talked about a little bit last week I don't think we're out of I don't think we're out of touch because again the crux of the show is where every gamer has a voice we are gamers we have voices we use them so maybe that maybe that's the wrong question to ask but I

309
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:49,026
[SPEAKER_12]: I really wish I could remember the detail of something that I was thinking about in one of these last couple of weeks.

310
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:57,729
[SPEAKER_12]: But basically what it boils down to is that there are obviously multiple sides to everything and there is nothing wrong with one individual's opinion against the other.

311
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:00,870
[SPEAKER_12]: They're both right, despite the points we just made five minutes ago.

312
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:11,053
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's kind of like we... It seems weird to me because collectively we've said the same... It feels like we've said the same thing for a month.

313
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:13,454
[SPEAKER_12]: A big collective sigh at the future.

314
00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:14,794
[SPEAKER_12]: and so on.

315
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:38,135
[SPEAKER_12]: How we deviated from the fact that almost all of us, if not all of us, owned every console of the last generation.

316
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:44,739
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, you know, we grew up with our parents and we had the one that we wanted or the one that our parents got us.

317
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:58,506
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we grew up more and we went for more and more and then we had jobs and we had income and we invested in the entire generation and took everything in and now we're here, the door is open, we can do what we want and we'll get there, but...

318
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:02,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you where I think your viewpoint skewed a little bit.

319
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, I get where you're going with this, but there's a couple things that caught my ear there.

320
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:11,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And one is that it's not that the future looks bleak for gaming.

321
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:12,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that.

322
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:16,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just none of us were ready to jump on the bandwagon right now.

323
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:19,317
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not the games to justify that right now.

324
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:21,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But to say the future looks bleak, not necessarily.

325
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:24,180
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some very exciting things on the horizon.

326
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:26,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And we continue to push things forward.

327
00:24:27,222 --> 00:24:27,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Oculus Rift

328
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:48,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So does the future of gaming look bleak?

329
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:49,268
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

330
00:24:49,348 --> 00:24:52,551
[SPEAKER_02]: As we get one step closer to the holodeck, the future of gaming looks awesome.

331
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,515
[SPEAKER_14]: It is awesome because now we're going to get a new Lawnmower Man movie.

332
00:24:55,655 --> 00:24:59,480
[SPEAKER_02]: But do they need my money right now?

333
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

334
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:07,009
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jason, if you think back to those consoles you did have as a kid, how many of them did your family really get on launch day?

335
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:08,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my family.

336
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we had a Super Nintendo.

337
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,511
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a Nintendo.

338
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:12,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a PlayStation.

339
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:14,633
[SPEAKER_02]: None of those consoles did I have in the first year.

340
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:18,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some cases, I think Super Nintendo was out for like three years before I got one.

341
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,677
[SPEAKER_12]: I have never owned a console on launch day.

342
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:27,125
[SPEAKER_02]: See, when you're the big kid and you get to make the purchases, then you get to, you know, kind of make some more of those decisions.

343
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:32,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not that we don't support the next generation of gaming by not getting those consoles right away.

344
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:32,892
[SPEAKER_02]: We just get there eventually.

345
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:37,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I just go, the realistic is, you know, now I've got to juggle the rest of the bills and so on.

346
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:38,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Jamie, I know you're down there.

347
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:47,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the other thing, too, is that we have experience to back us up, where we have been there for system launches, and we have gotten things close to launch window, you know?

348
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:51,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Dan and I waited in line for our Dreamcast.

349
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:53,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I waited in line for a Wii.

350
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:59,274
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, actually, Kristen and I bribed our place in line at Target with Krispy Kreme.

351
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:05,956
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the other systems Dan was able to get day one because he managed a GameStop, you know.

352
00:26:06,677 --> 00:26:07,637
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had the ends.

353
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:08,738
[SPEAKER_09]: We took advantage of it.

354
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:15,122
[SPEAKER_09]: But now it's like we have that experience of the disappointment that's come afterwards.

355
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:17,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, the shiny's worn off.

356
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:20,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan's done with, you know, Twilight Princess.

357
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:20,906
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we do now?

358
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:29,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I could sit here and try to play Trauma Center on Vicodin because that was right after my surgery too.

359
00:26:31,794 --> 00:26:32,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, go ahead.

360
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:48,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying that a lot of the people that you see waiting in line now are people who have more done maybe game launch waits or have had people to do the wait for them, but now they're getting the experience of getting it home and then going, well, what do I do now?

361
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:50,377
[SPEAKER_02]: They broke?

362
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:50,437
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

363
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:50,497
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

364
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:17,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, actually, yes.

365
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Compilations slash history.

366
00:27:20,003 --> 00:27:20,243
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

367
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:22,246
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all Nintendo.

368
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:29,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Which isn't going to do the people that call me a fanboy and that whole thing any favors.

369
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,832
[SPEAKER_02]: But just, I'm going to fess up.

370
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:34,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a Wii U on launch day.

371
00:27:34,294 --> 00:27:35,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a Wii on launch day.

372
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:37,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a DS on launch day.

373
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a 3DS on launch day.

374
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't buy a GameCube on launch day.

375
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:42,622
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't buy that.

376
00:27:43,142 --> 00:27:49,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the systems I can think of that I actually did punk down the money on on launch day, they were all Nintendo.

377
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:52,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to think in my head right now, like, well, why is that, Rob?

378
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:56,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you buy those systems, but yet you wouldn't do it for the PlayStation 4 and so forth?

379
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:58,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's about the games that were out.

380
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:04,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wii U had a Mario game I really wanted to play, and it had the zombie you, and you know that.

381
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:09,424
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii had Zelda, you know, amongst... That was the big decider for me.

382
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:11,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on and so on, you know.

383
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:14,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And 3DS and DS were a little bit different, granted, but...

384
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:17,811
[SPEAKER_02]: They were strong enough where I bought one on launch day.

385
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:19,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I buy a Vita on launch day?

386
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:21,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I did, but I bought it really close.

387
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:23,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So Vita was close.

388
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:29,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Dan and I, before that, because he had gotten his Saturn at launch.

389
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:34,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think he, yeah, Dan got his Saturn at launch and we got our Dreamcast at launch.

390
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:38,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And we got an import Dreamcast soon after the Japanese launch.

391
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,032
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were like that with everything Sega did.

392
00:28:43,206 --> 00:29:12,431
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing I haven't brought up on the show in a while is that I kind of took a siesta during that like I wasn't like when I was in college I actually I was going through some other stuff personally so I actually wasn't as big of a gamer during that period so I kind of missed the the Dreamcast launch probably right on up to the PlayStation 2 launch I think that finally started to bring me back in the fold thanks to DDR and everything and then I got into this show which really got me back into video games again but I kind of missed a gap there so but I kind of feel like if I was gaming I would have bought a Dreamcast on launch day

393
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:13,840
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

394
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:18,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to tell you the truth, that was actually one of the most fun launches I've attended.

395
00:29:18,618 --> 00:29:19,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet.

396
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:20,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, any thoughts?

397
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,602
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of strayed a little bit from the original topic, I'm sorry, but this is good stuff.

398
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I would blame Jason for that.

399
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:27,564
[SPEAKER_14]: My fault.

400
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:43,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought, well, I didn't buy anything this generation for launch stuff otherwise, but the PlayStation, Xbox 360 wasn't quite at launch because they were sold out, and so I got one from Craigslist, and so I got that near launch.

401
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:44,156
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it was pretty close.

402
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:45,196
[SPEAKER_14]: XBOX ONE XBOX ONE

403
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:12,479
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, like, I don't even really... I still don't really need a PlayStation 4.

404
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, there's nothing upcoming.

405
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Infamous looks good.

406
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:16,562
[SPEAKER_14]: For me, there is, though.

407
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:18,443
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll get to it later in the show.

408
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:45,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I was also going to say there's some chatter in here about different people having different systems at launch the other thing too that made system launches different for me and Dan was that when the last gen came out he was managing a GameStop so it wasn't like we had to go and wait in line he could just go to the store and pick it up it'd be behind the desk

409
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:46,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

410
00:31:09,113 --> 00:31:09,413
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

411
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:46,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I played some Final Fantasy 14 I thought about 8 and then I went lol no what else did I play I actually started playing Mass Effect 2 again just because I wanted more stuff to caption um

412
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:49,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, Animal Crossing.

413
00:31:49,645 --> 00:31:50,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still playing Zelda.

414
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm taking my sweet time with it.

415
00:31:53,988 --> 00:31:57,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm five songs away from having a complete song list in Animal Crossing now.

416
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:58,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

417
00:31:58,852 --> 00:32:01,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

418
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Crap, what else is it that I've played?

419
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:07,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, I tried to play Bust a Move Universe again and it's just awful.

420
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:08,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried to like it.

421
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:09,720
[SPEAKER_09]: It just was not good.

422
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,443
[SPEAKER_09]: It's clearly the reason it was $14 brand new.

423
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:14,804
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just hard to see.

424
00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:20,446
[SPEAKER_09]: and then I... Yeah, I think that's about it.

425
00:32:21,326 --> 00:32:26,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I kept going back and checking the roster list for Namco High because I'm really looking forward to playing it.

426
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,220
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

427
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:31,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

428
00:32:32,002 --> 00:32:33,983
[SPEAKER_14]: This week I played more Grand Theft Auto.

429
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:38,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Did a little bit more online on the 360.

430
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:42,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Got my character up to, I think, level 20, which is weird.

431
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:52,394
[SPEAKER_14]: See, it kind of sucks that they've nerfed everything because it's taken me so much longer to get up to level 20 on the Xbox 360 than it has on PlayStation 3, where I was playing it a lot more.

432
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:55,596
[SPEAKER_14]: And on PlayStation 3, I think I'm up to 28 or 30 or something.

433
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:05,723
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of hard to get them all high level, especially when I split my time between two different versions of the game.

434
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:08,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

435
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:09,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Other things I played.

436
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:15,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I played a little Minecraft this week just when I didn't have any internet at work and stuff.

437
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,113
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's as grindy as it's been.

438
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:23,014
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's horses.

439
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:25,816
[SPEAKER_14]: And I haven't really done anything with the horses.

440
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:27,677
[SPEAKER_14]: They just taunt me from outside the window.

441
00:33:28,878 --> 00:33:40,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and then I did, uh, as I was, uh, kind of hyping up last week, I did get to play some of the, um, final beta tests for Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

442
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,280
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fantastic.

443
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,721
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the game is pretty old, but, um... I was gonna say, we're on Just Cause 3 at this point, aren't we?

444
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:49,342
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they haven't put out number three yet.

445
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I thought we were.

446
00:33:50,522 --> 00:33:55,843
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's, uh, hopefully gonna be worked on, but... Clearly it's a series I've overlooked a bit, sorry.

447
00:33:56,223 --> 00:33:56,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, like Rent Those Autos.

448
00:33:57,003 --> 00:33:57,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

449
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:03,700
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say though, it's pretty amazing what they've done with this game.

450
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,811
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a game that was a single player game and they turned it into almost like an MMO.

451
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:10,695
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there are literally...

452
00:34:13,464 --> 00:34:14,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

453
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, the only thing is like, I haven't played Just Cause 2 in a long time.

454
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:43,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, the weapons are kind of limited and, you know, there's not a whole ton of vehicles, but you can like buy your own weapons in game.

455
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,701
[SPEAKER_14]: You kill people and you get money and, or you can do races and get money that way.

456
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:55,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, you know, you can jump to different places like teleport or you can, um, you know, join races and, um,

457
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:56,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

458
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:23,364
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can type in slash boost and then set it from 1.0 boost up to 20.

459
00:35:23,584 --> 00:35:26,206
[SPEAKER_14]: And so if you hit the gas and hit the boost, you can launch.

460
00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:30,649
[SPEAKER_14]: I was flying in a boat because I hit a wave or something like that.

461
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:35,412
[SPEAKER_14]: And I went into the sky and it wasn't coming down.

462
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:42,277
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's awesome because not only are you flying around and that stuff, but just cause you have this grappling hook.

463
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:45,399
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can grapple onto things and planes.

464
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

465
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:07,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

466
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:24,104
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't too bad.

467
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:25,825
[SPEAKER_14]: It was playable and it was a lot of fun.

468
00:36:25,845 --> 00:36:30,486
[SPEAKER_14]: It definitely gave me quite a big grin playing it.

469
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:31,467
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a lot of fun.

470
00:36:32,227 --> 00:36:41,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Since I can't kill anybody in Grand Theft Auto Online without being penalized for it, which is kind of lame, but this game, kill, kill, kill, kill, crash things into each other and

471
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:44,081
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all sorts of chaos.

472
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:46,122
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

473
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:51,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Busy, busy with you then with Just Cause Multiplayer.

474
00:36:53,204 --> 00:36:56,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a faction or some way that all the VOG people can play with you?

475
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:03,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, not right now because it's just a beta test, but you can create your own factions and join up and stuff like that.

476
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:06,069
[SPEAKER_14]: So that might be something we can do later on, especially because right now,

477
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:12,953
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be pretty hard to, like, stay together, because it's a huge map, and you kind of spawn into random locations.

478
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:20,257
[SPEAKER_14]: You can teleport to different places, but, you know, it's very easy to lose each other in that game.

479
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:34,405
[SPEAKER_14]: It was funny, though, there was one guy, like, I had jumped onto his boat, and he drove off, and so I stayed on his hood for a while, and then he kind of followed me around for a while, and then, like, you know, later on, I was playing through, and I passed by him, you know, parachuting and stuff, so...

480
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:35,946
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

481
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:39,227
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be fun once they launch it officially.

482
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:42,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Jason, do you have something you want to share this week?

483
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:56,413
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure this came up when it actually came out, but have we actually talked about the Miiverse 3DS, the DLC, for lack of a better word, for bonus games?

484
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really in depth, so go for it.

485
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:06,259
[SPEAKER_12]: It occurred to me this week when I was really drawing out my ability to play those.

486
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:15,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Those games are insane amounts of fun, but the problem is, like StreetPass, they rely on you passing people to actually generate it.

487
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:37,635
[SPEAKER_12]: I may have mentioned on the show sometime before that I have a router at home that takes advantage of Nintendo's remote street pass feature where somebody will... Somebody's data... Nintendo will save somebody's Mii data at a hotspot, and then when you go to that hotspot, you get their Mii data, your Mii goes in place, and so you can actually start to...

488
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:40,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Proliferate at least a little bit more in the community.

489
00:38:40,476 --> 00:38:50,482
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're supposed to be doing something like a Starbucks, a McDonald's in Europe and a McDonald's in America at the same time will swap data across regions, that kind of stuff.

490
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:58,426
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have a router that masquerades that and I get, you know, for Miiverse, I get 10 Miis in not even 10 minutes.

491
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:06,636
[SPEAKER_12]: and it really makes those games shine and especially like Mii Force just how in-depth it really is.

492
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:14,447
[SPEAKER_12]: I always forget the name of the ninja... Oh my goodness...

493
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:18,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Monster Manor, Flower,

494
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,828
[SPEAKER_12]: TigerClaw is very curious, how do you set up a router to do that?

495
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:39,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it have to be a specific brand or model?

496
00:40:02,405 --> 00:40:09,014
[SPEAKER_12]: It does because you have to be able to change the router's MAC address.

497
00:40:10,816 --> 00:40:20,249
[SPEAKER_12]: The 3DS has to communicate to the internet and Nintendo themselves stores Mii data and a MAC address.

498
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:26,372
[SPEAKER_12]: So the MAC address, there's a community, basically a homebrew community that revolves around this.

499
00:40:27,713 --> 00:40:31,094
[SPEAKER_12]: I can send you a ton of links and I will do that shortly.

500
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:36,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the router I bought was like 40 bucks and there's plenty of alternatives around as well.

501
00:40:37,177 --> 00:40:43,179
[SPEAKER_12]: So, as I predicted I was going to do this week, as far as having time to sit down and game, that did not happen.

502
00:40:43,299 --> 00:41:01,083
[SPEAKER_12]: I was training a new hire this week, which means my time was split between my own daily duties as well as getting him up to speed, and then all the fun things of dinner at work and all that kind of stuff, which meant that I got back to the place that I'm staying at like 11 o'clock or midnight every single night.

503
00:41:01,263 --> 00:41:02,783
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've been working on something for a while, right?

504
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:17,367
[SPEAKER_12]: I have, and the time that I did manage to have, and then finished off on Saturday, because everything lightened up yesterday, I actually sat down and at... I want to say it was DarkTetsuya's suggestion, but I don't recall who actually said it last week.

505
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:26,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody said in chat that it's great that we're putting this on YouTube as well, but can you take some advantage of visual content, i.e.

506
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:27,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Classic Game of the Week?

507
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,970
[SPEAKER_12]: I sat there and was like...

508
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:32,429
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a great idea and it's totally doable.

509
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:34,291
[SPEAKER_12]: So I took the show.

510
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:38,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I got some of the resources from what Rob has done on the previous episode.

511
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:42,762
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have a lot more ideas.

512
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:44,123
[SPEAKER_12]: I just didn't have the time to do it this week.

513
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:45,124
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just dipping your big toe in.

514
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:47,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, okay, yay, you got the classic game.

515
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus learning video editing and everything else.

516
00:41:50,090 --> 00:42:13,196
[SPEAKER_12]: so I took the video that Rob was playing in studio for Marble Madness while Jamie was talking about it and I spliced it into the video stream after the fact based off the audio that was going on it was time consuming as all hell and frustrating at times but I'm really really pleased with how it came out it's the only inner content of the video but there is more in store

517
00:42:13,836 --> 00:42:36,780
[SPEAKER_02]: all right well thank you for volunteering to take over the YouTube channel essentially it's gonna be great and you know we've gotten a little little bit of feedback on YouTube and I think people looking forward to seeing you know what we can do there and who knows you know I know I've said my piece about I don't know if talking heads during the show is the most interesting thing in the world and I've said my piece on that but who knows I might I might be swayed in 2014 you know things are a-brewin

518
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:58,543
[SPEAKER_02]: and if we can't think of anything we can just always fill the rest of the video full of YTMD strobing throughout the whole video works for me Bobby Blackwolf our guy that's on before us here at the Voice Geeks Network he says in chat I'm a little jealous OLR gets all these people to do things for them aww Bobby

519
00:42:59,808 --> 00:43:05,612
[SPEAKER_12]: I've, if it's any consolation, it took me a decade to realize that I can contribute.

520
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:06,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I am.

521
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:07,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

522
00:43:08,094 --> 00:43:08,795
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

523
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:09,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Really do.

524
00:43:10,136 --> 00:43:10,416
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

525
00:43:11,357 --> 00:43:13,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's talk about my gaming week.

526
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:15,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't have a whole lot to share with my gaming week.

527
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:18,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gosh, what could I talk about?

528
00:43:18,382 --> 00:43:21,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I've still been playing Final Fantasy XIV like a true addict.

529
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,464
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

530
00:43:50,578 --> 00:43:51,179
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

531
00:44:10,905 --> 00:44:11,446
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

532
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:28,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been playing an awful lot of that.

533
00:44:28,526 --> 00:44:32,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Randomly this week, I'll talk about a random game I played this week.

534
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:37,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know how there was that WB bundle that was on sale a few weeks ago and I've had the key in Steam?

535
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:42,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, the other night, I didn't want to play MMOs because I'm like, alright, I've hit my limit on MMOs.

536
00:44:42,895 --> 00:44:46,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to play something else to just cleanse the palate a little bit and do something else in games.

537
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:49,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Batman Arkham Asylum.

538
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I partied like it was, what, 2009 or whenever that game came out.

539
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:54,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's...

540
00:44:55,522 --> 00:45:06,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It was neat because it was the first time I played it on PC versus a console, and it runs really nice on my PC with the really crisp graphics, and I could just use an Xbox 360 controller, so it's just like playing it on console.

541
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:10,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great to go back and experience that again, and it's...

542
00:45:11,282 --> 00:45:18,410
[SPEAKER_02]: That game and Arkham City, and I haven't played the new one yet, but I know those first two at least are so well put together.

543
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,254
[SPEAKER_02]: They do such justice to the Batman comics, I think.

544
00:45:22,874 --> 00:45:29,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I know not everybody may agree, but if you're more of a fan of the animated series and the comics and all that, I think those games do it so well.

545
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:31,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Hamill does a great Joker, of course.

546
00:45:32,444 --> 00:45:34,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he wasn't in the most recent one, but in the earlier ones.

547
00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:39,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I've watched Dan play through the other two, and they're great games.

548
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:44,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially though I love all the Catwoman stuff in Arkham City.

549
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:48,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I also have Arkham City on Steam, so I'll play that at some point.

550
00:45:52,737 --> 00:45:57,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get through Arkham Asylum first, even though it might take me a little while, and you gotta tear me away from Final Fantasy XIV to do so.

551
00:45:59,501 --> 00:46:01,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've just been slowly making progress in other games.

552
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:14,110
[SPEAKER_02]: New Mario, New Zelda, I haven't been playing those as much as I was when I first got them, but I don't, I mean, there's no games left to buy at this point, so the good news is, you know, through the holidays, I'll be able to make progress on some of these games I fell behind in.

553
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what a lot of you have planned, eh?

554
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:17,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

555
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:18,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh?

556
00:46:19,093 --> 00:46:19,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh?

557
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:19,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh?

558
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:20,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't you know.

559
00:46:20,354 --> 00:46:21,275
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

560
00:46:21,355 --> 00:46:22,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Housekeeping.

561
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:28,464
[SPEAKER_02]: You, of course, can friend the show at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and you can follow us on Twitter.

562
00:46:28,764 --> 00:46:29,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't friend our butts.

563
00:46:29,645 --> 00:46:32,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

564
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people aren't going to get that joke, DarkSakura.

565
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,474
[SPEAKER_02]: She's referencing an old-ass joke here on OLR.

566
00:46:38,135 --> 00:46:38,916
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was I going to say?

567
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:40,978
[SPEAKER_02]: We are on YouTube now as well.

568
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,621
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

569
00:46:43,661 --> 00:46:46,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jason, very much for taking the time to put that all together.

570
00:46:46,744 --> 00:46:51,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't bust your ass being a perfectionist on that because that's killed me so many times.

571
00:46:53,911 --> 00:47:20,425
[SPEAKER_02]: do it 99% and you're good in my defense I did because I didn't the video played essentially three and a half times and I know the second time was out of sync only this much I'm gonna fuck that up so bad Jason so don't get used to that it'll happen but we're dying for more YouTube comments on what you guys would like to see over there outside of cameras in the studio we know you all want that we'll

572
00:47:21,665 --> 00:47:21,885
[SPEAKER_02]: See.

573
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:23,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

574
00:47:25,646 --> 00:47:30,347
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the schedule for the show goes, I don't see us taking any shows off between now.

575
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:35,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the way Christmas and New Year's are this year, I think we're going to have shows right on through the new year.

576
00:47:36,528 --> 00:47:37,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Subject to change, though.

577
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:40,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki will not be here next week, though, unfortunately.

578
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:41,510
[SPEAKER_02]: At least we don't think he's going to be.

579
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, would you like to tell listeners why you're not going to be here next week?

580
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,691
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to be here next week because on Thursday I have to get my wisdom teeth out.

581
00:47:48,427 --> 00:47:49,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Good times.

582
00:47:49,748 --> 00:47:50,148
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

583
00:47:50,248 --> 00:47:53,831
[SPEAKER_02]: We are dying for Loki videos on the anesthesia.

584
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:11,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I was confused.

585
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about my ex-boyfriend with my mother.

586
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:17,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I will never have anesthesia again after that.

587
00:48:17,822 --> 00:48:18,803
[SPEAKER_02]: What was I thinking?

588
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,023
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

589
00:48:20,183 --> 00:48:20,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let's see.

590
00:48:20,883 --> 00:48:29,007
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see what I talk about, but I told her that I think she should record me like, you know, David at their dentist thing.

591
00:48:29,027 --> 00:48:30,187
[SPEAKER_14]: We could just totally do that.

592
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should play Grand Theft Auto while you're on the anesthesia.

593
00:48:32,288 --> 00:48:34,990
[SPEAKER_14]: I probably will do it while I'm on the anesthesia.

594
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

595
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:38,251
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be a hilarious video.

596
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:40,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Playing Grand Theft Auto while I'm on anesthesia.

597
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:41,841
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm asleep.

598
00:48:43,605 --> 00:48:44,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing's happening.

599
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just gonna let it play and just let it sit there for 15 minutes.

600
00:48:49,747 --> 00:48:55,789
[SPEAKER_14]: No, so yeah, I'm not looking forward to that because I've never been put under and never had an IV.

601
00:48:56,389 --> 00:48:58,610
[SPEAKER_14]: All these firsts that I really don't want to have to do.

602
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:04,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture here at the Voice of Geeks Network says, Wuss, get your butt to the show.

603
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:04,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Been there, done that.

604
00:49:05,013 --> 00:49:07,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a hand sandwich two hours after mine were out.

605
00:49:07,253 --> 00:49:07,994
[SPEAKER_14]: No, exactly.

606
00:49:08,394 --> 00:49:09,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I'm totally with you.

607
00:49:11,255 --> 00:49:14,016
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like ready to go back to work the next day, but my wife's like, oh.

608
00:49:14,136 --> 00:49:15,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're not going to be able to eat anything.

609
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:16,339
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not going to be able to go out to work.

610
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:23,528
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, dude, he said I could eat something right after my jaw becomes unnumbed because they don't want you to bite through your cheek or something like that.

611
00:49:23,768 --> 00:49:25,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hope you don't run into the same thing that I did.

612
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:26,812
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?

613
00:49:27,492 --> 00:49:33,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the bottom holes didn't fill up for three months and I looked like I'd been in a prize fight for the entire time.

614
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool, then I'm going to totally say I'm in a price fight.

615
00:49:35,954 --> 00:49:38,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I also couldn't talk for those three months.

616
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:41,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was talking like this because I'm moving my jaw.

617
00:49:42,499 --> 00:49:45,540
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got to say, I think SSJ100Matt is absolutely right in the chat room.

618
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:47,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe his dad's a dentist, if I remember right.

619
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:50,043
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, wisdom teeth recovery is different for each person.

620
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:52,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to eat fine a day or two after.

621
00:49:52,065 --> 00:49:53,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think it just depends on each person.

622
00:49:54,126 --> 00:49:55,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's only two.

623
00:49:55,447 --> 00:49:57,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't neglect the saline wash thing they tell you about.

624
00:49:57,768 --> 00:49:58,569
[SPEAKER_14]: That's super important.

625
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:03,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they're suturing them up, so I don't think it's going to be anything that we need to... I didn't have to do a saline wash either.

626
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be able to wash anything if it's sutured up.

627
00:50:07,053 --> 00:50:07,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

628
00:50:07,693 --> 00:50:11,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I seem to remember something about you don't want to get dry socket.

629
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:21,259
[SPEAKER_09]: No, what I had to do was this... Actually, they gave me a natural treatment to strengthen the gums, and then I didn't have to do any type of rinses or anything afterwards, but I had my wisdom teeth out.

630
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:23,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I went to the back alley, Dennis.

631
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I had mine out, though, in the 2000s, you know.

632
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:27,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

633
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:46,442
[SPEAKER_02]: A meat shake!

634
00:50:46,582 --> 00:50:47,743
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not as good as you think it is.

635
00:50:47,763 --> 00:50:49,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Does your meat shake bring all the boys to the yard?

636
00:50:50,643 --> 00:50:52,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Jack in the Box still do the bacon milkshake?

637
00:50:53,044 --> 00:50:54,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh god, that wasn't very good.

638
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:55,625
[SPEAKER_14]: That was pretty disgusting.

639
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,706
[SPEAKER_14]: It just tastes like smoky vanilla.

640
00:50:58,106 --> 00:50:59,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with AkumaJP.

641
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,346
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR dentist edition.

642
00:51:00,386 --> 00:51:01,887
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going way too far down the dentist line.

643
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:05,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into gaming news and what's going on in the video game world.

644
00:51:05,928 --> 00:51:07,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it is the holidays, things are slowing down a little bit.

645
00:51:07,949 --> 00:51:09,049
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still some things to point out.

646
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:09,949
[SPEAKER_02]: from the week.

647
00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:10,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite a bit, actually.

648
00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:11,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

649
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:11,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Scott.

650
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,430
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not actually going to be on Laughing Gas.

651
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:17,812
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be actually... I'm pretty sure it's an IV.

652
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:20,253
[SPEAKER_14]: That's too bad because I think it would be hilarious.

653
00:51:20,273 --> 00:51:20,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on both.

654
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:23,354
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they're going to put me on both.

655
00:51:24,154 --> 00:51:29,496
[SPEAKER_02]: They did give me a... They needed both to knock out your soul, DarkSakura.

656
00:51:29,516 --> 00:51:30,616
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole reason...

657
00:51:32,097 --> 00:51:38,742
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, it's true, but the whole reason is because it actually dilates your blood vessels.

658
00:51:39,143 --> 00:51:40,083
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave me something.

659
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:41,665
[SPEAKER_09]: They couldn't get the IV in.

660
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:45,087
[SPEAKER_14]: They gave me something to take the edge off before I go there.

661
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:46,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember what it is, some sort of drug.

662
00:51:47,129 --> 00:51:49,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you take the edge off the show by doing some gaming news?

663
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:54,875
[SPEAKER_14]: So Sony has reset some PlayStation Network passwords.

664
00:51:55,876 --> 00:51:57,998
[SPEAKER_14]: They said that there was some irregular activity.

665
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:01,886
[SPEAKER_14]: and apparently they came out.

666
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:03,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Try not to alarm anyone.

667
00:52:04,046 --> 00:52:16,608
[SPEAKER_14]: We routinely monitor for irregular activity and if such activity is detected, we may sometimes reset passwords of affected SCN accounts to protect consumers and their account information.

668
00:52:16,648 --> 00:52:21,749
[SPEAKER_14]: The password resets are not related to an attack nor a vulnerability in our data servers.

669
00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:26,190
[SPEAKER_14]: It is an example of an increasingly common threat of malicious online activity.

670
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:39,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Although, I'd like to follow that up with, didn't I just read not too long ago that there was some people being affected by the same type of shit that we saw with the FIFA hacking now on the PlayStation 4?

671
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,561
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe it's something to do with that.

672
00:52:42,102 --> 00:52:45,184
[SPEAKER_14]: But maybe I'm also being too conspiracy furious.

673
00:52:46,437 --> 00:52:54,719
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I have some serious concerns about this story because when I turned on my PlayStation 3 earlier this week, it made me reset my password.

674
00:52:55,419 --> 00:52:56,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm one of the people that had to do it.

675
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was a part of me that's like, why?

676
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:01,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I being picked?

677
00:53:01,741 --> 00:53:05,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there shouldn't be any irregularities on my account.

678
00:53:05,842 --> 00:53:09,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I only use my PlayStation 3 and the Vita once in a great while.

679
00:53:10,263 --> 00:53:11,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I having to reset my password?

680
00:53:12,004 --> 00:53:13,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, you know, it's kind of...

681
00:53:13,664 --> 00:53:19,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, changing your password is good and so forth, but it's like, okay, now I really have to have unique passwords for everything.

682
00:53:19,294 --> 00:53:22,419
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's in Constellation, they only hacked celebrities, okay?

683
00:53:23,044 --> 00:53:31,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that's my problem is that I'm like, wait a minute, does that mean I was one of those people that they saw vulnerability for from the 2 million other hack thing?

684
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:34,370
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, son of a bitch, like, am I at risk?

685
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it has me a little concerned.

686
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:43,475
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is actually on the heels of a similar tech story about three or four weeks ago.

687
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:47,598
[SPEAKER_12]: The chief one was the start of September with the big Adobe hack.

688
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:59,302
[SPEAKER_12]: There were between that and then there are other miscellaneous news about... Not that Twitter and Facebook were hacked, but I saw something from them earlier this week.

689
00:54:01,023 --> 00:54:06,365
[SPEAKER_12]: LinkedIn and Adobe's password theft were like the big ones a couple months ago.

690
00:54:07,045 --> 00:54:10,667
[SPEAKER_12]: And this trend that's emerged from these really prominent companies is that

691
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:13,389
[SPEAKER_12]: They will get that exported data.

692
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:18,092
[SPEAKER_12]: And if your password, if your email address shows up, they'll warn you.

693
00:54:18,553 --> 00:54:26,459
[SPEAKER_12]: If your password matches the same password hash because any company in their right mind does not store plain text passwords, unfortunately some do.

694
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:27,600
[SPEAKER_12]: These don't.

695
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:33,384
[SPEAKER_12]: If your password matches a leaked hash, they reset your password because they force you.

696
00:54:33,664 --> 00:54:52,470
[SPEAKER_02]: you might have hit the nail on the head because I use unique passwords everywhere but you probably use the same email address but I use the same email address as PlayStation Network I had an Adobe account on there that could be it you might be right I feel a little better knowing that even with hashed passwords

697
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I could, to the extent that I actually have this knowledge, I could delve in.

698
00:54:57,334 --> 00:54:59,897
[SPEAKER_02]: The quick overview is that... Remember, I'm a corporate trainer.

699
00:54:59,937 --> 00:55:01,519
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Adobe stuff.

700
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:02,100
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a thing.

701
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Why didn't they just say, hey, we saw that Adobe has been hacked.

702
00:55:07,045 --> 00:55:07,846
[SPEAKER_14]: These people have been hacked.

703
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:08,387
[SPEAKER_14]: We ran...

704
00:55:08,387 --> 00:55:09,648
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet Codeman's an Adobe user.

705
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:12,669
[SPEAKER_14]: I know he does stuff with video and graphic design.

706
00:55:33,643 --> 00:55:34,023
[SPEAKER_14]: That's weird.

707
00:55:34,183 --> 00:55:36,845
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm an Adobe user too, but I didn't have to reset my password.

708
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:41,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's because I don't... Well, I never got any... Did you use different emails though?

709
00:55:41,968 --> 00:55:44,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I give them... And did you subscribe to their live services?

710
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I never got anything to reset my Adobe passwords though.

711
00:55:48,552 --> 00:55:52,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever use like... The name escapes me all of a sudden.

712
00:55:52,194 --> 00:55:54,095
[SPEAKER_02]: The screencast or whatever it is that they use.

713
00:55:54,775 --> 00:55:56,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just any of their online services.

714
00:55:56,556 --> 00:55:57,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Acrobat Online or...

715
00:55:58,293 --> 00:56:15,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the Creative Cloud because I was given the account for Creative Cloud for a year C. Allen Chatroom says Tinfoil Hat Radio I'm looking for a trend Okay, Shane Alinko says I don't use Adobe but I had to reset mine Alright, so y'all just blew a hole in my theory Do you use LinkedIn?

716
00:56:17,242 --> 00:56:18,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

717
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:19,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I use LinkedIn.

718
00:56:19,263 --> 00:56:20,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe he did, though.

719
00:56:21,204 --> 00:56:21,524
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

720
00:56:22,084 --> 00:56:24,405
[SPEAKER_02]: If Shane uses LinkedIn, then he's not on my profile.

721
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:26,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to know why he's not my friend on LinkedIn.

722
00:56:26,206 --> 00:56:41,772
[SPEAKER_12]: I use LinkedIn with my work email, so I don't ever... There are many different sources of these things happening, and even when the extracted information and breach is released, sometimes it's not all of the information...

723
00:56:43,993 --> 00:56:56,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, if they just go off password hashes, which are not necessarily a perfect way of doing things, but if data doesn't match, your record doesn't show up, you don't have to change it, there is no one answer for everything.

724
00:56:56,177 --> 00:57:00,318
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the continuing saga of security exploits, vulnerabilities.

725
00:57:01,058 --> 00:57:02,819
[SPEAKER_12]: It happens, it continues on, whatever.

726
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:05,419
[SPEAKER_12]: It happened as long as you take your precautions to stay safe.

727
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:06,580
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have a problem here.

728
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Use distinct passwords, enable two-factor authentication if the service supports it,

729
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:12,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Be safe out there.

730
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:13,583
[SPEAKER_12]: It sucks sometimes.

731
00:57:14,323 --> 00:57:18,807
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it's awesome other times, like this show.

732
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,187
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

733
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:20,288
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about drugs and chat.

734
00:57:20,848 --> 00:57:29,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I don't want to... I want to really kind of just make sure I poke something with a sharp stick here, what Loki said about the whole FIFA hacks happening again on Sony.

735
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:34,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure I call that out because that's a great concern to me.

736
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:39,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And I seem to remember when this... My memory could be going here.

737
00:57:39,462 --> 00:57:40,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I seem to remember EA...

738
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,605
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

739
00:58:06,572 --> 00:58:08,394
[SPEAKER_12]: EA, you got some splainin' to do!

740
00:58:32,453 --> 00:58:38,017
[SPEAKER_12]: My brain has like seven companies in mind that's trying to remember the loop of the details and it's been a long time.

741
00:58:38,117 --> 00:58:39,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an explanation.

742
00:58:39,738 --> 00:58:44,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not totally convinced it's the right one, especially now that we have this other thing going on here.

743
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:53,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of need EA to be very clear here on why it's not them and some very specific about what they're doing with data and how they're keeping it safe.

744
00:58:53,949 --> 00:58:55,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that as a consumer.

745
00:58:55,491 --> 00:59:02,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you might be a tech person sitting there going, Rob, there's no way that... As a consumer right now, I don't trust that this isn't happening because of something on EA's side.

746
00:59:04,299 --> 00:59:12,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just too weird of a coincidence that it happened on Microsoft through an EA game and now it's happening through Sony on an EA game.

747
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:14,421
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that.

748
00:59:15,021 --> 00:59:18,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Scottatron in chat says, yeah, like EA would fess up to anything.

749
00:59:18,843 --> 00:59:25,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then we'll have to see how much we want to support them and give them information and money further on.

750
00:59:26,268 --> 00:59:31,312
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyhow, here's something that I'm sure a lot of you will be spending money on.

751
00:59:31,352 --> 00:59:35,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that was announced during the VGX award show.

752
00:59:35,915 --> 00:59:43,360
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the few highlights out of the show, Telltale announced that they are working on a game, Tales from the Borderlands.

753
00:59:43,980 --> 01:00:05,809
[SPEAKER_02]: so of course Telltale did the speaking of video game award shows they won them all for Walking Dead last year now tons of people want to work with them so Gearbox Software one of the people is working with Telltale on this so it's a game in the Borderlands universe it will be an episodic series the storyline is defined by player choices Gearbox will be providing Borderlands assets

754
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:10,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Telltale, however, is the ones that are designing the game.

755
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:12,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Telltale did make new characters for this game.

756
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:20,823
[SPEAKER_02]: They are saying they are not quite Vault Hunters, and some of the characters seen in it, possibly Handsome Jack.

757
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:23,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's more of a resemblance thing.

758
01:00:23,144 --> 01:00:24,184
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in the trailer.

759
01:00:24,244 --> 01:00:26,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of me kind of wonders, could it be like a prequel or something?

760
01:00:27,266 --> 01:00:31,208
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's supposed to be during the same time as Borderlands 2 or before.

761
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:32,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

762
01:00:33,549 --> 01:00:35,330
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't the only thing Telltale had to announce.

763
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:40,692
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced quite a bit because they also announced that they're working on a Game of Thrones game.

764
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:42,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Chair of Swords.

765
01:00:42,633 --> 01:00:45,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, didn't we already have something?

766
01:00:45,534 --> 01:00:48,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that came out I think last week or earlier this week.

767
01:00:48,956 --> 01:00:49,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Telltale clearly very busy.

768
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,770
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I noticed, there wasn't a lot that people have been talking about this year.

769
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:21,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Telltale kind of didn't have a lot this year, although chat pointed out to me before the show, The Wolves Among Us or something was a game that came out this year, but that didn't get quite the chatter that some of their other releases have.

770
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:21,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

771
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:24,604
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

772
01:01:54,853 --> 01:02:00,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know we've had a lot of joy over a particular gaming franchise and that's Tomb Raider.

773
01:02:01,437 --> 01:02:06,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the definitive edition is coming out for PS4 and Xbox One.

774
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:13,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be out on January 28th in the US and in Europe on January 31st.

775
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:16,707
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was announced on the game's Tumblr.

776
01:02:16,747 --> 01:02:18,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to see Tumblr getting more love.

777
01:02:19,529 --> 01:02:31,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So you get all of the pre-order bonuses, the Tomb of the Lost Adventurer, and the multiplayer add-ons, eight DLC maps, six weapons, and four characters.

778
01:02:31,992 --> 01:02:39,634
[SPEAKER_09]: You also get extra Lara outfits and digital copies of the Tomb Raider The Beginning and the art book.

779
01:02:40,134 --> 01:02:41,494
[SPEAKER_09]: So lots of stuff.

780
01:02:41,594 --> 01:02:44,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the final hours of Tomb Raider will be included as well.

781
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:49,681
[SPEAKER_09]: The Xbox One version will have connect voice controls for weapon modding and menus.

782
01:02:50,743 --> 01:02:52,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's... I don't care.

783
01:02:52,205 --> 01:02:52,305
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

784
01:02:53,275 --> 01:02:59,238
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a part of me that wants to razz us a little bit because it's like, so we're remaking a game that just came out last year?

785
01:02:59,778 --> 01:03:06,101
[SPEAKER_12]: But then I think, all right, well, but at the same time... At least they gave you everything and didn't just move the game and have you rebuy everything.

786
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:15,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, and the other thing is, too, that it's not uncommon for big games to get a Game of the Year edition that includes everything.

787
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:22,629
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what this is, but yet they turned it up for these new consoles, which I find... It's just interesting.

788
01:03:22,689 --> 01:03:30,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really seen something like this that I can think of before, you know, outside maybe Nintendo remaking some of the Wii games.

789
01:03:30,134 --> 01:03:32,376
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not even the same thing, you know?

790
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,197
[SPEAKER_12]: I like this sentence in the article.

791
01:03:35,155 --> 01:03:48,486
[SPEAKER_12]: on PS4 your controller will light up when using the torch it's cute especially I'm assuming they'll also use the backlight the eye light as well but the controller is already lit up all the time so am I using the torch all the time?

792
01:03:52,104 --> 01:04:10,638
[SPEAKER_09]: The big thing about that for me personally though is that given that I've played it on PC and just all of the graphical glory that it produced as well as being solid gameplay wise I think it'd be a nice treat for people at home to be able to play it up to that level too.

793
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:29,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I gotta be honest, as much as I'm saying like, you know, oh, this is interesting, you know, I do still kind of want to, I actually really want to get it, because I thought the game was gorgeous as it was on, you know, even 360, and now they're talking about, oh, we're gonna turn up the graphics even more, and I'm kind of like, ooh, I kind of want to check that out.

794
01:04:30,012 --> 01:04:35,515
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, price, do I want to drop $60 on it again?

795
01:04:35,535 --> 01:04:39,217
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to check it out with better graphics, play it on PC.

796
01:04:39,978 --> 01:04:40,338
Ha ha ha!

797
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:52,387
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, it's different to be better graphics from what they've got or they are going back and actually upping some of the assets and so forth.

798
01:04:52,587 --> 01:04:57,510
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't just repackaging it and playing it on the new consoles.

799
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:02,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I think it's just putting more of the PC assets on the console.

800
01:05:03,054 --> 01:05:04,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're going back and redoing anything.

801
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:07,156
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the impression I was getting, Loki.

802
01:05:07,176 --> 01:05:08,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's more to it than that.

803
01:05:08,557 --> 01:05:08,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

804
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:12,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially because they talk about, like, the stuff... I know this... Alright, well, I guess we'll find out in a month and a half.

805
01:05:12,399 --> 01:05:15,200
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably gonna go, big deal, but the stuff with the hair sounds very different.

806
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:19,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, that takes... You know, and they got these other studios to get involved, too.

807
01:05:19,642 --> 01:05:20,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So that takes work.

808
01:05:20,423 --> 01:05:21,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, the stuff with her hair?

809
01:05:22,724 --> 01:05:25,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they changed something that her hair is more...

810
01:05:26,543 --> 01:05:27,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluid?

811
01:05:27,504 --> 01:05:27,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Hairy.

812
01:05:28,084 --> 01:05:29,165
[SPEAKER_14]: It's more hair-like, yes.

813
01:05:29,185 --> 01:05:29,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

814
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:33,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I believe that was one of the PC things, if I remember correctly.

815
01:05:33,788 --> 01:05:35,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take a look, shall we?

816
01:05:35,649 --> 01:05:44,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have to say that there was a difference in, as far as when I first loaded up the game with the lower end and then bumped it up all the way, there were a little bit few differences with hair mechanics.

817
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:47,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Hair mechanics, remember.

818
01:05:47,616 --> 01:05:50,258
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a special thing, hair mechanics.

819
01:05:50,871 --> 01:06:00,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I would believe that would be the Tomb Raider Tress FX hair, which is an option on PC that's enhanced hair, both the physics and stuff.

820
01:06:00,904 --> 01:06:03,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Hair physics.

821
01:06:03,888 --> 01:06:05,811
[SPEAKER_14]: That, yes, would be a PC thing.

822
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:08,955
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically they're taking the PC assets and putting them on next gen.

823
01:06:09,475 --> 01:06:11,878
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what hair physics always make me think of?

824
01:06:15,421 --> 01:06:16,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Soul Edge.

825
01:06:16,923 --> 01:06:22,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Tekken games when they started doing... You can see the strands of hair.

826
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:25,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, but it doesn't look like real hair.

827
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:28,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say that Lara's hair looked like hair.

828
01:06:29,515 --> 01:06:30,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very hairy.

829
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:32,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just thought the game in general looked great.

830
01:06:32,928 --> 01:06:45,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it already was starting to look, you know, like... I don't want to say it looked like next-gen, but it just looks like such a... It's a great example of what the previous-gen consoles were really capable of.

831
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:46,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

832
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,623
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm fairly certain because, you know, Dan's been seeing me play the game.

833
01:06:51,664 --> 01:06:59,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I've gone back and played it, you know, tried to get a little bit further because I haven't beaten it yet, but I did play it fairly consistently and I would love to see Dan play through that.

834
01:06:59,674 --> 01:07:00,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he'd enjoy it.

835
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:06,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there are some people that missed the boat the first time around too.

836
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:12,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I see in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Shane Alinko says, this is good for me as I didn't play the original release.

837
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:13,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll definitely look into getting this.

838
01:07:14,588 --> 01:07:22,835
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's a part of me that's like, how did you miss the original release when the game was on sale for a steal on some of the very Steam sales and so forth?

839
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:27,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I used my Steam wallet gift and got it.

840
01:07:28,492 --> 01:07:30,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I paid three bucks extra for it.

841
01:07:31,573 --> 01:07:33,273
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

842
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:35,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

843
01:07:35,574 --> 01:07:35,974
[SPEAKER_02]: More news.

844
01:07:36,034 --> 01:07:36,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

845
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:37,754
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

846
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:39,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

847
01:07:39,915 --> 01:07:43,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One.

848
01:07:43,676 --> 01:07:48,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember one of the things that they kind of talked about, I think it was a few months ago, this whole...

849
01:07:49,878 --> 01:07:54,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Being able to publish using your Xbox One as a dev kit.

850
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:58,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, some people figured out how to do that, or at least get into the dev kit mode.

851
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:00,884
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been dicking around with that.

852
01:08:01,725 --> 01:08:12,871
[SPEAKER_14]: For the actual devs, they've already listed 33 developers that are participating in their ID at Xbox program, I guess, if you want to call it that.

853
01:08:13,691 --> 01:08:21,657
[SPEAKER_14]: um including uh Behavior which I guess they did uh Wet and Naughty Bear Panic in Paradise.

854
01:08:21,938 --> 01:08:23,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Wet was a good game Naughty Bear not so much.

855
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:36,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Bongfish uh Born Ready uh Cappy which did Super Time Force uh Concept Crytek uh Definition Six which did Spy Party um

856
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:56,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Demerge, ShootManyRobots, Double Eleven, LittleBigPlanetVita, Double Fine, Drinkbox, Gaijin Games, the Bit.Trip series, Half Brick Studios, Fruit Ninja, Happy and Labs, Hidden Path, High Voltage Software, which did The Conduit.

857
01:08:57,245 --> 01:08:59,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, they haven't released anything in a long time.

858
01:09:00,127 --> 01:09:03,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Anise, you may remember them, Elite Beat Agents, anyone?

859
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:10,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Iron Galaxy, Jackbox Games, Nicholas, which did Cave Story and VVVV.

860
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know that same guy did both those games.

861
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:14,435
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty sweet.

862
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:22,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Ninja Bee, Other Ocean, which is the Dark Void Zero and Super Monkey Ball games on iOS.

863
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:23,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Panic Button.

864
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:34,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Signal Studios, Slightly Mad Studios, Team 17, Team Colorblind, The Men Who Wear Many Hats, The Odd Gentleman, Vladimir,

865
01:09:42,433 --> 01:10:08,910
[SPEAKER_12]: WayForward, Z-Boy Games, and Zen Studios If I remember correctly, Nicholas did the 3D... It's either that they published VVVVVV or that they brought it to DS or some other platform because that was Terry Cavanaugh and I'm pretty sure he self-publishes everything They might have done the ports then because I know a lot of these guys are doing ports of things And Cave Story did come out on multiple platforms as well

866
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:20,608
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing to kind of go along with that, though, is some of the indie publishers are running into, I guess, some of their...

867
01:10:22,987 --> 01:10:25,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Small print things in this part of this program.

868
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:36,218
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, not only do you get, I guess, the wonderful... You get two console development kits, a Unity license, and the ability to publish your games by yourself.

869
01:10:37,219 --> 01:10:48,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, they ask that the games that launch same day on Xbox One and any other console platforms, they say they want launch parity rather than exclusivity.

870
01:10:49,169 --> 01:10:49,329
[SPEAKER_14]: And...

871
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:54,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess one of the developers that ran into this...

872
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:58,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it Vlambeer?

873
01:10:58,189 --> 01:10:59,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Vlambeer.

874
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:21,116
[SPEAKER_14]: They were saying that one of their games, Nuclear Throne, I guess, was supposed to... They were talking with them about bringing it to the Xbox One, and I guess they maybe wanted it to be exclusive, but somehow, because of that, they're actually going to publish it on PlayStation 4.

875
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:22,737
[SPEAKER_14]: They said...

876
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:50,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I'll just come out on PlayStation 4 first I guess they didn't have an Xbox One version available but they wanted to publish it on that platform later on but because Microsoft is basically restricting you, you must launch your game on the Xbox One and then all the other platforms at the same time so they didn't want to hold up the other versions of the game for the

877
01:11:51,658 --> 01:11:53,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Could that be because of what happened with DuckTales?

878
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Because DuckTales didn't come out on Xbox until way after the other versions.

879
01:11:57,843 --> 01:11:58,543
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's that.

880
01:11:58,603 --> 01:12:05,348
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they just didn't want to be at a disadvantage as far as exclusive versions or something.

881
01:12:05,848 --> 01:12:06,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that's fine.

882
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:10,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they just don't want Sony to have a window on that stuff.

883
01:12:10,772 --> 01:12:14,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft wants to have the window on Call of Duty DLC and all that bullshit.

884
01:12:14,194 --> 01:12:15,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, of course.

885
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:16,916
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe that's what the issue is.

886
01:12:18,453 --> 01:12:29,580
[SPEAKER_14]: I think though, I don't know, maybe they can get around it by doing, you know, pulling kind of what Microsoft did with, you know, Minecraft, you know, having the Minecraft Xbox One version and then Minecraft PlayStation 4 version.

887
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:33,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Technically, they're two different games, you know, and then they'd be able to publish it later on or something.

888
01:12:34,242 --> 01:12:38,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Wolf says, he wants to try to explain this here, the Xbox One wants parity.

889
01:12:38,864 --> 01:12:43,126
[SPEAKER_02]: The loophole, if you are already signed up for another platform, they don't have to wait.

890
01:12:43,466 --> 01:12:46,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So they said, quote, oh, they want parity if I sign.

891
01:12:46,367 --> 01:12:48,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Sony, want a one-month exclusive?

892
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:49,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, sure.

893
01:12:49,989 --> 01:12:52,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, hey, Microsoft, we want to sign up.

894
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:53,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, that's fine.

895
01:12:56,201 --> 01:13:22,607
[SPEAKER_12]: so interesting this is a great policy in theory for gamers, consumers most of all because it means that no matter what platform you've backed if your game is coming multi-console you will get it and you don't have to spoilers or any other consideration you don't have to wait on anybody else maybe in theory because Bobby just pointed out there's a way around it yeah but

896
01:13:23,367 --> 01:13:37,335
[SPEAKER_12]: As far as games that actually get released on multiple platforms at the same time, if you do not budget your time... This article basically talks that the development shop, that Vlambeer was caught off guard.

897
01:13:38,296 --> 01:13:51,003
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you do not budget your time properly or you just come across this, if you are bound to this, it's going to hurt your firm and potentially your results and potentially the game because you weren't expecting to have to put...

898
01:13:52,143 --> 01:14:03,748
[SPEAKER_12]: almost quite almost entirely literally two times the work in for one release date I love this concept but like anything else it has a trade-off that unfortunately gets to be pretty nasty pretty quick

899
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:16,184
[SPEAKER_14]: If I were them, I would just want the least amount of restrictions possible for the developers because right now the perception is PlayStation 4 is very developer friendly.

900
01:14:16,844 --> 01:14:23,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Xbox One, I don't think they've quite gotten there yet where people are kind of recognizing as a platform that they can find their favorite indie games.

901
01:14:25,171 --> 01:14:29,434
[SPEAKER_14]: I would think they want the least amount of obstacles in between them and getting that, at least at the beginning.

902
01:14:30,615 --> 01:14:32,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell, change your rules later on down the line once you have

903
01:14:33,945 --> 01:14:37,026
[SPEAKER_14]: A decent catalog of indie games.

904
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:44,388
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm also kind of disappointed that they kind of got rid of the whole... It's kind of a two-fold thing.

905
01:14:44,408 --> 01:14:48,270
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kind of disappointed that they got rid of the whole community games.

906
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:52,651
[SPEAKER_14]: And the idea of, oh, I can use my Xbox One to publish my own games and stuff.

907
01:14:52,671 --> 01:14:53,451
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really cool.

908
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:57,833
[SPEAKER_14]: But I understand that there were a lot of crappy games on that service.

909
01:14:58,593 --> 01:15:02,597
[SPEAKER_14]: At the same time, though, it still would be nice to have that ability to put your own games on there.

910
01:15:02,617 --> 01:15:08,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe with some sort of peer review or something like that to filter out those massage simulators.

911
01:15:08,404 --> 01:15:09,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Clear out the chaff.

912
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:10,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

913
01:15:18,732 --> 01:15:19,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 games.

914
01:15:49,293 --> 01:16:07,249
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's people and I don't want to say that they're dumb enough to believe it but they're not educated enough on how these systems really work that they actually kind of believe it because they use the magic words that oh you're gonna you're gonna get into dev console mode on your Xbox one and it'll unlock the ability to play Xbox 360 games and

915
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's review.

916
01:16:10,753 --> 01:16:18,744
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why Xbox 360 games are not playable on the Xbox One is because the chips inside have changed completely.

917
01:16:18,784 --> 01:16:20,346
[SPEAKER_02]: They are different manufacturers now.

918
01:16:20,446 --> 01:16:20,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct, Loki?

919
01:16:21,573 --> 01:16:23,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's a different architecture altogether.

920
01:16:23,394 --> 01:16:25,556
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, see, that... Surprise!

921
01:16:25,836 --> 01:16:26,897
[SPEAKER_14]: That came from 4chan.

922
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And basically, it's somewhat stumbled upon the way to get into developer mode.

923
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:36,564
[SPEAKER_14]: And Microsoft said, hey, don't try to get into developer mode because it will break your console.

924
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:38,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's two parts.

925
01:16:38,685 --> 01:16:42,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft has to basically give you the access to this.

926
01:16:42,628 --> 01:16:47,992
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you also have to enable it on your console in order to actually switch it over to developer mode.

927
01:16:48,212 --> 01:16:50,074
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't do it without their access...

928
01:16:50,754 --> 01:16:51,674
[SPEAKER_14]: IOS 7 makes your device waterproof!

929
01:17:21,624 --> 01:17:21,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, what?

930
01:17:21,984 --> 01:17:22,545
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a thing?

931
01:17:22,565 --> 01:17:22,885
[SPEAKER_07]: No shit.

932
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:23,726
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a thing?

933
01:17:23,746 --> 01:17:24,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I kid you not.

934
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:25,147
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even hear that.

935
01:17:25,247 --> 01:17:31,731
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go to Twitter search and you type in iOS waterproof, the top tweet minus the fucking LG ad, whatever.

936
01:17:32,572 --> 01:17:38,836
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do that in Twitter search, I actually did this just to kind of make sure I wasn't crazy.

937
01:17:38,977 --> 01:17:44,741
[SPEAKER_12]: And sure enough, the very first tweet in the search results, 4chan convinced people that iOS 7 makes their iPhones waterproof.

938
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:48,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they've convinced people to brick their Xbox Ones with backwards compatibility.

939
01:17:48,523 --> 01:17:48,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

940
01:17:49,565 --> 01:17:52,852
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's just a lesson that if something is too good to be true, it probably is.

941
01:18:02,355 --> 01:18:09,419
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, it's just interesting to me that there's always been smoke and mirrors, and there's a better terminology for this.

942
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:15,663
[SPEAKER_12]: There's always been snake oil salesmen, but these are the internet snake oil salesmen.

943
01:18:15,683 --> 01:18:22,527
[SPEAKER_14]: I use common sense, but if they had the ability to play backwards, they have full backwards compatibility, they would be totally pimping that shit out.

944
01:18:22,947 --> 01:18:27,369
[SPEAKER_14]: If not trying to sell it as a DLC or something, but they would be pimping that shit out.

945
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:29,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, we have backwards compatibility, those guys don't.

946
01:18:30,151 --> 01:18:31,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you lock that away?

947
01:18:31,992 --> 01:18:32,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just silly.

948
01:18:33,433 --> 01:18:33,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

949
01:18:34,393 --> 01:18:36,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on to less silly things.

950
01:18:37,054 --> 01:18:38,955
[SPEAKER_09]: How about something that's a lot kinder?

951
01:18:40,855 --> 01:18:46,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's actually an article talking about the Humble Bundle and one of the charities that they've helped out.

952
01:18:46,438 --> 01:18:52,060
[SPEAKER_09]: They've actually been working to bring clean drinking water to Ethiopia, which I think...

953
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:56,883
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely something positive that we need to be focusing on instead of people being assholes.

954
01:18:58,184 --> 01:19:06,970
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, they worked with a particular charity that used 100% of the donations to bring clean water.

955
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:15,756
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now they have 3,275 people in Ethiopia that are going to have clean water.

956
01:19:16,096 --> 01:19:19,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And the total amount came up to $121,780.

957
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:47,892
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's pretty good news see we're not all assholes I like to hear the gamers doing good stories and plus it's kind of nice to see too we always kind of like I think a lot of us when we're buying these humble bundles and so forth we just kind of click the button and it's like oh yay some of my money's going to good pat myself on the back we don't really see it past that so I'm glad there's information out there like this to really kind of show like here is how the money is really helping you know what I mean

958
01:19:48,177 --> 01:20:02,951
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think it's good that they're being so transparent with how that money is being allocated to and giving us the option and you know it's sort of like hey you know you do something good for somebody else we'll do something good for you here have some fun

959
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:23,162
[SPEAKER_09]: you know I've always been a big advocate of the charities like that especially you know even though I'm not too fond of Penny Arcade themselves I've been happy with Child's Play and with a lot of those charities that basically turns our love of games into almost love for other people right you know

960
01:20:24,844 --> 01:20:28,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

961
01:20:28,526 --> 01:20:34,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this might be a short segment tonight, but we check in every week on what games are coming out in a video game store near you.

962
01:20:34,691 --> 01:20:35,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting with the US, Loki.

963
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:40,955
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing coming out this week is Sorcery Saga Curse of the Great Curry God on PlayStation Vita.

964
01:20:41,755 --> 01:20:50,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, if I remember correctly, there's Dreamfall Adventures or Chrono... I think it's Dreamfall Adventures that's coming out on Xbox 360.

965
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:52,102
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been delayed forever.

966
01:20:52,122 --> 01:20:53,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's being delayed again, but...

967
01:20:54,123 --> 01:20:55,064
[SPEAKER_14]: That was supposed to be coming out.

968
01:20:55,765 --> 01:20:56,746
[SPEAKER_14]: And then guess what?

969
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:58,808
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it for the entire year.

970
01:20:59,849 --> 01:21:00,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured as much.

971
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:02,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty Ghosts

972
01:21:25,482 --> 01:21:30,524
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as new games go, there's a new PlayStation 3 console bundle with Puppeteer that's out this week.

973
01:21:30,985 --> 01:21:37,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jinsei Ego 2 Next Generation and Nobunaga no Yabu Suzo comes out this week from Koei.

974
01:21:37,568 --> 01:21:42,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what you can look forward to this week on December 12th as far as PlayStation 3 goes.

975
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me check out 360.

976
01:21:44,911 --> 01:21:49,813
[SPEAKER_02]: The same Call of Duty Ghosts dubbed version is out there as well as Dishonored the Game of the Year Edition.

977
01:21:49,873 --> 01:21:50,754
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it for the 360.

978
01:21:53,235 --> 01:21:58,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the PlayStation Vita, Hatsune Miku Project Diva gets a price reduction.

979
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:00,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Vita's region-free, right?

980
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,321
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be your time to pick it up.

981
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:09,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So folks here in the U.S., if you want your version of Hatsune Miku for the Vita, this might be a good time to pick it up.

982
01:22:09,886 --> 01:22:14,589
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Wii U, the Balance Board USB adapter comes out this week.

[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly but not leastly on the Nintendo 3DS, Hometown Story, Kirameki Waku Waku Suite, Kobito no Fushigi Jigen Set comes out this week, Puzzle and Dragons Z, is that the same as the cell phone game?

985
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:02,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it is.

986
01:23:02,249 --> 01:23:02,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

987
01:23:04,161 --> 01:23:06,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello Kitty to Mahou no Apron Rhythm Cooking

988
01:23:23,996 --> 01:23:24,576
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

989
01:23:24,977 --> 01:23:25,777
[SPEAKER_02]: You can cook.

990
01:23:26,778 --> 01:23:29,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Cooking Mama meets a rhythm game meets Hello Kitty.

991
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:30,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I shit you not.

992
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,141

01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:32,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I shit you not.

994
01:23:32,082 --> 01:23:34,163

995
01:23:34,183 --> 01:23:35,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, go back to the name real quick.

996
01:23:35,084 --> 01:23:35,424
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

997
01:23:35,504 --> 01:23:36,105
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not there.

998
01:23:39,427 --> 01:23:40,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, close.

999
01:23:40,488 --> 01:23:40,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.

1000
01:23:41,368 --> 01:23:43,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Kitty with the magic apron.

1001
01:23:45,011 --> 01:23:47,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a rhythm cooking game starring Hello Kitty.

1002
01:23:47,112 --> 01:23:47,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And a magic apron.

1003
01:23:48,113 --> 01:23:49,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't I have this?

1004
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:51,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I want this.

1005
01:23:51,481 --> 01:23:51,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to me.

1006
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:52,703
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not worthy.

1007
01:23:52,963 --> 01:23:54,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is the 3DS not region-free?

1008
01:23:56,068 --> 01:23:57,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it'll come out over here.

1009
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:00,634
[SPEAKER_02]: BadBatsMaru is making a steak, goddammit.

1010
01:24:01,255 --> 01:24:02,056
[SPEAKER_02]: This is amazing.

1011
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:07,975
[SPEAKER_12]: YYIR would like to point out that Project Diva F is being localized and will be eventually released in North America.

1012
01:24:08,155 --> 01:24:09,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people can't wait, YYIR.

1013
01:24:10,636 --> 01:24:15,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, all those DDR games and 2DX games and whatnot that we have other language writing.

1014
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:17,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Telling the wrong show.

1015
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,521
[SPEAKER_02]: My Japanese PlayStation 2 says hello.

1016
01:24:21,021 --> 01:24:21,361
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1017
01:24:21,741 --> 01:24:23,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And soon my Japanese 3DS.

1018
01:24:25,683 --> 01:24:25,983
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1019
01:24:26,903 --> 01:24:28,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.

1020
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Stick It To The Man Stick It To The Man

1021
01:24:52,737 --> 01:24:53,918
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the best name ever.

1022
01:24:54,459 --> 01:24:56,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to name my firstborn and stick it to the man.

1023
01:24:58,021 --> 01:25:01,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1024
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:05,067
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR in chat, by the way, saying you waited this long?

1025
01:25:05,107 --> 01:25:06,508
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's been out over six months.

1026
01:25:06,869 --> 01:25:08,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true because the...

1027
01:25:11,347 --> 01:25:15,208
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true because the version that's coming out in Japan this week is like a best hits type of thing.

1028
01:25:15,248 --> 01:25:16,089
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a price reduction.

1029
01:25:16,589 --> 01:25:19,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And YYR is saying you could get the PlayStation 3 version right now.

1030
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:20,610
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1031
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:24,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I do need to get that game because I said I would buy it when it comes down in price.

1032
01:25:24,432 --> 01:25:25,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it finally did.

1033
01:25:25,472 --> 01:25:27,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to get Hatsune Miku here.

1034
01:25:28,214 --> 01:25:28,414
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1035
01:25:28,454 --> 01:25:30,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, back to some news before we get to the classic game of the week.

1036
01:25:30,815 --> 01:25:31,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1037
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:39,241
[SPEAKER_14]: So, like we talked about last week with Forza 5 and their microtransactions, Gran Turismo 6 also had microtransactions.

1038
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:46,426
[SPEAKER_14]: And Sony, of course, claims that they are not required for players to advance in the game, but you might say the same about the Forza 5 ones.

1039
01:25:49,008 --> 01:25:58,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I've seen far less people complaining about these than the Forza ones, but I'm not really sure why, considering they both sound the same to me.

1040
01:25:58,358 --> 01:25:59,379
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess that's how it's presented.

1041
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:07,788
[SPEAKER_14]: They're saying, as with previous installments of Gran Turismo, users are able to earn in-game credits and unlock cars by competing in races.

1042
01:26:08,728 --> 01:26:18,132
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you want to buy credits, they are in increments of half a million on the PlayStation Network to speed up the process of unlocking content.

1043
01:26:19,672 --> 01:26:21,973
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

1044
01:26:22,233 --> 01:26:28,575
[SPEAKER_14]: It sucks that there's microtransactions in both games, but like I said, I haven't played either one, so I don't know how they're presented.

1045
01:26:29,436 --> 01:26:30,736
[SPEAKER_14]: But that still sucks.

1046
01:26:32,637 --> 01:26:32,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Well...

1047
01:26:34,881 --> 01:26:36,122
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1048
01:27:03,121 --> 01:27:09,378
[SPEAKER_02]: here's where I think people get miffed at this kind of thing because I'm sure there's a lot of you sitting at home going you know why is Loki mad this isn't a big deal

1049
01:27:12,177 --> 01:27:26,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of us feel like, especially some of us that really did the old school gaming and lived through the NES phase and so forth, I remember a day when you would pause the game, press up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start, and now your ship is fully decked out with everything you need to beat the game.

1050
01:27:26,082 --> 01:27:28,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of us, that's the only way we wanted to play the game, right?

1051
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:35,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you want the fully decked out ship, you could sign on and pay $3.99 to get the special unlock key.

1052
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:36,465
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who we have to blame?

1053
01:27:36,746 --> 01:27:37,866
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

1054
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:39,927
[SPEAKER_14]: You know who started this bullshit?

1055
01:27:39,967 --> 01:27:40,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

1056
01:27:41,227 --> 01:27:44,029
[SPEAKER_14]: It's always the same company that starts this bullshit.

1057
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:45,150
[SPEAKER_14]: EA.

1058
01:27:45,731 --> 01:27:49,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Because remember it was with, I want to say, The Godfather.

1059
01:27:50,255 --> 01:27:51,836
[SPEAKER_14]: The PlayStation 2 version.

1060
01:27:53,427 --> 01:27:53,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1061
01:28:14,215 --> 01:28:16,376
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the sense, yes, they are.

1062
01:28:16,636 --> 01:28:24,341
[SPEAKER_14]: They are the root of all evil in the gaming industry because they came up with the concept of this Project $10 thing where they would do these online passes.

1063
01:28:24,461 --> 01:28:25,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody jumped on that shit.

1064
01:28:26,482 --> 01:28:28,683
[SPEAKER_14]: They did this thing with, you know, hey, you know what?

1065
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:36,228
[SPEAKER_14]: We could sell shit that we give away for free on other platforms because people will buy them because they really want to do that stuff, and so let's just sell it.

1066
01:28:36,648 --> 01:28:39,990
[SPEAKER_14]: And sure enough, they do it, and it's just gone downhill from there.

1067
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:42,351
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're the ones that always seem to be...

1068
01:28:43,812 --> 01:28:48,197
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, innovating in that area, I guess, if you will.

1069
01:28:49,678 --> 01:28:53,262
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yes, I am throwing shade at them because it is ridiculous.

1070
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:58,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Loki just say on the show that he's throwing shade?

1071
01:28:59,929 --> 01:29:00,650
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say, Rob?

1072
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:01,491
[SPEAKER_14]: You've rubbed off on me.

1073
01:29:06,573 --> 01:29:07,254
[SPEAKER_08]: What's happened?

1074
01:29:07,854 --> 01:29:08,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

1075
01:29:08,475 --> 01:29:09,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm embarrassed myself.

1076
01:29:09,756 --> 01:29:11,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you did say you had cooties before.

1077
01:29:11,677 --> 01:29:12,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

1078
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:13,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

1079
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:13,999
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1080
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:18,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, on a much more serious note, because this news sucks.

1081
01:29:18,703 --> 01:29:20,064
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no easy way to put it.

1082
01:29:21,005 --> 01:29:26,129
[SPEAKER_02]: An actor named Danny Wells passed away this week, and he was 72 years old.

1083
01:29:26,269 --> 01:29:30,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Although you might not recognize the name, you probably recognize the character.

1084
01:29:30,552 --> 01:29:33,455
[SPEAKER_02]: He played Luigi on the Super Mario Bros.

1085
01:29:33,475 --> 01:29:34,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Show when it was on in the 80s.

1086
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:48,802
[SPEAKER_02]: with Captain Lou that's right Captain Lou unfortunately he had passed away a few years ago so the brothers are reunited they have both moved on well some people though can't

1087
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:56,733
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't stand to not point out the irony that Nintendo had made this the year of Luigi and this is how it ends.

1088
01:29:56,813 --> 01:29:57,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was thinking that too.

1089
01:29:57,813 --> 01:30:03,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's kind of one of those like, wow, that joke's kind of sick, but it is awkward.

1090
01:30:03,475 --> 01:30:03,975
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1091
01:30:03,995 --> 01:30:05,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know what word to put on that.

1092
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:08,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a little strange that this is the year of Luigi.

1093
01:30:08,477 --> 01:30:09,737
[SPEAKER_08]: John Leguizamo's not dead, is he?

1094
01:30:10,097 --> 01:30:10,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Never say never.

1095
01:30:38,644 --> 01:30:39,425
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1096
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:51,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't you playing this?

1097
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:54,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe find a game where Wikipedia isn't making me log in.

1098
01:30:54,932 --> 01:30:56,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know you had to log in.

1099
01:30:57,074 --> 01:30:58,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't think you had to either.

1100
01:30:58,695 --> 01:31:00,056
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's see if this reloads.

1101
01:31:00,777 --> 01:31:08,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the classic game of the week is the second of unreleased games that I have spoken about on the show.

1102
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:10,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I've mentioned this one many, many times.

1103
01:31:11,185 --> 01:31:12,006
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Thrill Kill!

1104
01:31:13,419 --> 01:31:19,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so it was an unpublished game from 1998 that came out on the PlayStation.

1105
01:31:20,521 --> 01:31:34,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason why I'm bringing this one up is the fact that it was really one of the big games that sort of people were able to get a hold of it because of the internet.

1106
01:31:34,685 --> 01:31:36,428
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, someone leaked out the version.

1107
01:31:36,728 --> 01:31:39,613
[SPEAKER_09]: And since then, we've had plenty of other games come out.

1108
01:31:40,153 --> 01:31:44,039
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, didn't I bring up... Before I...

1109
01:31:46,807 --> 01:31:58,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Space Fantasy Zone was the other game I had reviewed, but there's been other ones too, like the Crystal Dynamics Macross game, a Robotech game that never came out, but people have played it because the prototype's out online.

1110
01:31:59,516 --> 01:32:10,343
[SPEAKER_09]: So Thrill Kill is one of those games, and the big thing about this one is that it was supposed to be a four-player fighting game, which I think it got turned into that Wu-Tang Clan game or something the engine did.

1111
01:32:11,404 --> 01:32:16,987
[SPEAKER_09]: But this one was really a lot more of the BDSM.

1112
01:32:17,848 --> 01:32:23,011
[SPEAKER_09]: It had a lot more of the fetish thing and a lot more of the crazy murder cannibalism.

1113
01:32:23,331 --> 01:32:24,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gross.

1114
01:32:24,432 --> 01:32:25,433
[SPEAKER_09]: This game was gross.

1115
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:32,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you had the character Judas that one of the extra characters looked like Ken and Ryu attached to the torso.

1116
01:32:33,698 --> 01:32:35,219
[SPEAKER_09]: With one being upside down or the other.

1117
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:37,921
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, that was the single worst

1118
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:44,445
[SPEAKER_09]: ending of that game too because that was the first person I beat the game with.

1119
01:32:45,406 --> 01:32:53,751
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it was completed before it was cancelled and it did get leaked out and now people are able to play it on emulators, modded consoles.

1120
01:32:53,831 --> 01:33:05,898
[SPEAKER_09]: We had the GameShark thing on ours so we used to use the paperclip and then after that we ended up using the GameShark to play our downloads and stuff like that.

1121
01:33:06,568 --> 01:33:12,391
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it was developed by Paradox Development and then later Midway Los Angeles.

1122
01:33:13,031 --> 01:33:18,554
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was supposed to be published by Virgin Interactive, who was acquired by EA Pacific.

1123
01:33:19,655 --> 01:33:20,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, EA.

1124
01:33:21,496 --> 01:33:30,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And then EA cancelled the game because they didn't want to publish a senselessly violent game that would hurt their image like they fucking needed it.

1125
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:53,705
[SPEAKER_02]: so anyway that guy just like pretended to sodomize the other guy and then kick him in the butt that's just mean oh she did it too and then she hit him with an electric prod yeah that's belladonna Jamie that's gross this game is so gross okay Rob's mom why don't you read a book

1126
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:58,680
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1127
01:33:59,461 --> 01:34:02,023
[SPEAKER_09]: That video that was on the internet just popped into my mind.

1128
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:07,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Read a book, read a book, read a motherfucking book.

1129
01:34:07,946 --> 01:34:08,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1130
01:34:08,707 --> 01:34:10,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1131
01:34:10,868 --> 01:34:15,531
[SPEAKER_09]: The type of game that it is, it's a closed 3D room, and basically four players fight to the death.

1132
01:34:16,092 --> 01:34:25,618
[SPEAKER_09]: It has thrill kills, which are like fatalities, and you build up a kill meter, so your bloodlust rises, and then you kill somebody, and blah, it's gross.

1133
01:34:26,358 --> 01:34:31,162
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, the plot of the story is that ten souls have gone and descended into hell.

1134
01:34:32,262 --> 01:34:40,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And their hell is based off of the real world's sort of deviance, like the BDSM person.

1135
01:34:40,468 --> 01:34:43,470
[SPEAKER_09]: You have Cletus, the butcher guy.

1136
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:48,033
[SPEAKER_09]: You have Dr. Faustus as one of the characters.

1137
01:34:50,200 --> 01:35:19,182
[SPEAKER_09]: um I was looking in chat room now I'm thinking buy some speed stick it's not expensive anyway um yeah the chat room is starting to quote that video maybe I should have made that the cookie anyway so moving forward is basically um each of the characters is a murderer and um they are being judged and so are put into fighting so that one of them can reincarnate um they go in hopes of being reborn so yeah

1138
01:35:19,642 --> 01:35:29,996
[SPEAKER_09]: The game, it was really, like the official US PlayStation magazine counted it as one of the most overrated canceled games.

1139
01:35:30,697 --> 01:35:32,860
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were very correct with their quote.

1140
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:34,682
[SPEAKER_09]: It got lots of hype, but it really sucked too.

1141
01:35:35,703 --> 01:35:37,204
[SPEAKER_09]: We just played this because it was hilarious.

1142
01:35:37,605 --> 01:35:38,525
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I was right.

1143
01:35:38,565 --> 01:35:40,667
[SPEAKER_09]: It was remade into Wu-Tang Shaolin style.

1144
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:52,856
[SPEAKER_09]: And the engine was also used for a two-player X-Men Mutant Academy that was put out by Activision and its sequel and Rock'em Sock'em Robots Arena that was put out by Mattel.

1145
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:59,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And Game Informer linked this 10th on a list of the top 10 games that almost were.

1146
01:36:00,482 --> 01:36:04,185
[SPEAKER_09]: It really was very bad.

1147
01:36:04,554 --> 01:36:05,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Dying Fetus Dying Fetus

1148
01:36:27,072 --> 01:36:27,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

1149
01:36:27,492 --> 01:36:37,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And so while it was a festering pile of shit, because it really was, it was notable for being internet related.

1150
01:36:38,101 --> 01:36:41,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Some movies are classics because they're so bad.

1151
01:36:41,244 --> 01:36:42,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Showgirls, right?

1152
01:36:42,665 --> 01:36:45,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a classic game can still be one that...

1153
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:48,982
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is of questionable taste.

1154
01:36:49,002 --> 01:36:49,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I feel dirty.

1155
01:36:49,563 --> 01:36:51,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that one, which is gross.

1156
01:36:51,745 --> 01:36:52,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel dirty.

1157
01:36:52,445 --> 01:36:53,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe you should go read a book.

1158
01:36:53,947 --> 01:36:54,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Read a book.

1159
01:36:54,447 --> 01:36:55,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get some Speed Stick.

1160
01:36:55,588 --> 01:36:56,389
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not expensive.

1161
01:36:57,049 --> 01:36:57,289
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1162
01:36:58,490 --> 01:37:07,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for this first half of the show, but we have plenty more show to come, including the Fugo Question of the Week, Rapid Fire News, your emails, your phone calls, much more.

1163
01:37:07,338 --> 01:37:14,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, there might even, if you're all good kids, just in time for the holidays, I may have a story near the end about pornography.

1164
01:37:14,784 --> 01:37:15,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned.

1165
01:37:16,365 --> 01:37:43,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll get to all that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio We are live on this December the 8th of 2013 With the 530th episode of our program Alright, we've had a lot of gaming news so far But there's plenty more news to come So let's get right back into it, Loki

1166
01:37:46,104 --> 01:37:47,545
[SPEAKER_14]: DUNKY KONG TROPICAL FREEZE

1167
01:38:05,257 --> 01:38:19,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, this was the big announcement that Nintendo had been teasing about on Twitter and everywhere else that they got on the show to share this incredibly important piece of information.

1168
01:38:19,613 --> 01:38:21,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and the release date of February 21st.

1169
01:38:22,776 --> 01:38:24,038
[SPEAKER_14]: What a wasted opportunity.

1170
01:38:26,027 --> 01:38:53,276
[SPEAKER_02]: well if they've got nothing else to say I mean I don't even bother being there I mean seriously well I don't know like I get the whole like wanting to build hype for the game that's coming out and everything but I think and I don't know who's to really to blame for this if it's Nintendo's fault or if it's internet slash fans fault that this was hyped up like OMG they're gonna show a new Zelda they're not gonna show I don't think that they would do that but like but there were people out there that that was the expectation bar in some people's heads

1171
01:38:54,596 --> 01:38:56,637
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not even that exciting of news.

1172
01:38:56,677 --> 01:39:04,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, it was blown up to be way bigger than what it ended up being, but I'm not sure who's really at fault for that.

1173
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:12,644
[SPEAKER_14]: This is kind of one of those bullet points that they go, during their Nintendo Directs, oh, and by the way, we have exclusive news on a new character for blah blah blah.

1174
01:39:12,704 --> 01:39:14,605
[SPEAKER_14]: It was something that really didn't need to be...

1175
01:39:16,105 --> 01:39:19,087
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, he didn't need to go to this show to do that.

1176
01:39:19,307 --> 01:39:29,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say, though, that there's a part of me that does kind of see the humor in that Nintendo really hyped up that they were going to give VGX a big exclusive and then they kind of pooped on that.

1177
01:39:29,153 --> 01:39:30,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that is kind of funny in a way.

1178
01:39:32,055 --> 01:39:33,536
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to see the humor in that, at least.

1179
01:39:33,796 --> 01:39:34,877
[SPEAKER_14]: That is kind of, I mean...

1180
01:39:36,269 --> 01:39:43,255
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I'm sure they would have to have shared the news with them, but it kind of lets us play make-believe here for a little bit.

1181
01:39:43,295 --> 01:39:52,343
[SPEAKER_14]: It would have been funny that they didn't tell them what it was, and so they're like, oh yeah, we're going to get them on the show, it's going to be incredible, and they drop the bomb, hey, and Cranky Kong's in Donkey Kong.

1182
01:39:53,023 --> 01:39:53,383
[SPEAKER_14]: What?! !

1183
01:39:54,608 --> 01:39:55,489
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you had?

1184
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:56,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously?

1185
01:39:57,530 --> 01:40:02,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Scottatron in chat says the hosts seemed pissed after this announcement, so maybe they didn't know.

1186
01:40:02,092 --> 01:40:02,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They did seem kind of pissed.

1187
01:40:02,933 --> 01:40:05,594
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like, oh, what about like news on a Metroid or something like that?

1188
01:40:05,614 --> 01:40:12,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard some people on Twitter were saying that it almost came off as rude, like that they were kind of rude to Nintendo.

1189
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:14,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, again, that could be through fandom lens.

1190
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:16,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't watch it, but what was your impression?

1191
01:40:16,821 --> 01:40:17,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that?

1192
01:40:17,401 --> 01:40:19,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw the clip because they have this like kind of, you know...

1193
01:40:21,423 --> 01:40:22,724
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1194
01:40:45,663 --> 01:40:46,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1195
01:41:08,843 --> 01:41:10,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, it's like, who gives a shit?

1196
01:41:11,224 --> 01:41:15,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's not like it's... I don't know, it's not that big a deal.

1197
01:41:15,646 --> 01:41:16,586
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, that's cool.

1198
01:41:16,626 --> 01:41:17,587
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a playable character.

1199
01:41:17,687 --> 01:41:21,429
[SPEAKER_02]: All I'm saying is that Nintendo may not be the ones to really blame for that.

1200
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:24,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at it from a trolling perspective, it's great.

1201
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:25,571
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that.

1202
01:41:25,751 --> 01:41:32,135
[SPEAKER_14]: But who is this... I mean, Nintendo has to understand where their demographic is.

1203
01:41:32,395 --> 01:41:35,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is watching an award show about video games?

1204
01:41:35,957 --> 01:41:38,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Not casual people that play video games.

1205
01:41:38,619 --> 01:41:41,641
[SPEAKER_14]: It's people that are fucking dedicated, hardcore into video games.

1206
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:44,903
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to spend the time watching a video games award show.

1207
01:41:45,563 --> 01:41:48,545
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you put this out there, no one gives a shit.

1208
01:41:48,785 --> 01:41:49,506
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, they just...

1209
01:41:50,226 --> 01:41:55,288
[SPEAKER_14]: It further reinforces the fact that Nintendo just doesn't get what I want.

1210
01:41:55,408 --> 01:42:00,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this would have been a great time to announce... To be fair, I'm not... Announce a new Smash Bros.

1211
01:42:00,351 --> 01:42:01,151
[SPEAKER_02]: character if you want to do that.

1212
01:42:01,171 --> 01:42:11,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not totally defending Nintendo here or whatever because this would be a great opportunity to come out and say, Virtual console games will now be playable across the internet and the camera on your Wii U, you can see your opponent.

1213
01:42:12,216 --> 01:42:13,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how amazing would that be?

1214
01:42:13,937 --> 01:42:15,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Except that is never going to happen.

1215
01:42:16,418 --> 01:42:17,819
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what frustrates people about Nintendo.

1216
01:42:17,839 --> 01:42:25,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if you want to do something lame like announce a character or something, do it for a game that your hardcore fanbase is actually going to go after, which would be Smash Bros.

1217
01:42:25,443 --> 01:42:26,784
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, announce a new Smash Bros.

1218
01:42:26,824 --> 01:42:27,684
[SPEAKER_14]: character or something.

1219
01:42:28,244 --> 01:42:29,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Cranky Kong is a new Smash Bros.

1220
01:42:30,005 --> 01:42:30,326
[SPEAKER_14]: character.

1221
01:42:30,646 --> 01:42:32,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's a little bit more interesting now.

1222
01:42:32,927 --> 01:42:34,107
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's just this...

1223
01:42:36,248 --> 01:42:36,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

1224
01:42:37,249 --> 01:42:38,590
[SPEAKER_14]: For me, I'm not buying the game.

1225
01:42:38,671 --> 01:42:40,772
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even own the console, so it's not a big deal.

1226
01:42:40,813 --> 01:42:43,875
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's just kind of like you had the opportunity.

1227
01:42:44,236 --> 01:42:49,681
[SPEAKER_02]: You hyped this big thing, and then you could have just... I've been on the fence about this Donkey Kong game.

1228
01:42:49,961 --> 01:42:53,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really... You know, I like the Donkey Kong Country games, but I just don't... I don't know.

1229
01:42:53,764 --> 01:42:56,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of feel like there'll be other stuff I want to play when this game comes out.

1230
01:42:57,067 --> 01:43:00,530
[SPEAKER_02]: This didn't exactly sway me into the must-buy category.

1231
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:01,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just put it that way.

1232
01:43:01,391 --> 01:43:04,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Donkey Kong Country was special when it was on Super Nintendo.

1233
01:43:04,273 --> 01:43:08,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I think that's, for me, I'm going to be honest, I think that series is a little played out for me.

1234
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:16,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, now it's been there, done that, because there's nothing really advanced graphically or gameplay-wise that wasn't done.

1235
01:43:17,301 --> 01:43:20,463
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, Nintendo does platformers very well.

1236
01:43:20,503 --> 01:43:22,224
[SPEAKER_02]: This new Mario game is one of the best of the year.

1237
01:43:22,244 --> 01:43:26,766
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is the thing, is they're kind of saying, hey, you know, new Super Mario Bros.

1238
01:43:26,786 --> 01:43:27,547
[SPEAKER_14]: sold pretty well.

1239
01:43:28,107 --> 01:43:29,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take the new Super Mario Bros.

1240
01:43:29,888 --> 01:43:32,648
[SPEAKER_14]: gameplay and we'll inject it into yet another game.

1241
01:43:32,948 --> 01:43:33,889
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's kind of what they're doing.

1242
01:43:33,909 --> 01:43:37,610
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, oh hey, four player co-op is what's going to be in this game.

1243
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:39,810
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm assuming because they have another character now.

1244
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:42,471
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's going to be four player co-op in this.

1245
01:43:42,551 --> 01:43:45,872
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically new Donkey Kong Country.

1246
01:43:45,932 --> 01:43:47,892
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of what it seems like to me.

1247
01:43:48,072 --> 01:43:49,353
[SPEAKER_14]: So much for rapid fire news.

1248
01:43:49,993 --> 01:43:53,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft made the same point based off the description of the character he saw.

1249
01:43:53,554 --> 01:43:55,394
[SPEAKER_12]: He made exactly the same point that I was going to.

1250
01:43:56,135 --> 01:43:57,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Scrooge McCranky Kong

1251
01:43:58,666 --> 01:43:59,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

1252
01:43:59,828 --> 01:44:00,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on.

1253
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:02,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, Final Fantasy VIII came out on Steam.

1254
01:44:02,955 --> 01:44:05,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people hated it, some people loved it.

1255
01:44:05,479 --> 01:44:05,880
[SPEAKER_14]: It's $11.99.

1256
01:44:06,942 --> 01:44:08,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Same price as Final Fantasy VII.

1257
01:44:09,363 --> 01:44:10,504
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1258
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:34,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God.

1259
01:44:34,023 --> 01:44:34,683
[SPEAKER_02]: That's welcome.

1260
01:44:34,703 --> 01:44:35,664
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a welcome change.

1261
01:44:35,824 --> 01:44:37,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now I might buy it.

1262
01:44:37,445 --> 01:44:40,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this changes everything.

1263
01:44:41,369 --> 01:44:42,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, we need to let's play.

1264
01:44:43,595 --> 01:44:44,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll think about it.

1265
01:44:45,956 --> 01:44:47,296
[SPEAKER_02]: When it goes on sale.

1266
01:44:47,836 --> 01:44:53,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta read a real quick comment in the chat about the Nintendo thing and it's really good so I need to get this out there.

1267
01:44:53,638 --> 01:44:55,298
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100 Matt says, but you know what?

1268
01:44:55,318 --> 01:44:58,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo still makes bank so they don't have to announce anything.

1269
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:05,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly it bothers people because Nintendo comes off like the old uncle who keeps giving their nephews the same gift every year for Christmas the past 20 years.

1270
01:45:06,741 --> 01:45:07,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it when that gift is money.

1271
01:45:35,074 --> 01:45:40,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love that, you know, instead of Mario, Metroid, Zelda, Kirby, I guess.

1272
01:45:41,696 --> 01:45:46,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I would almost buy that argument, except for two big, big reasons.

1273
01:45:46,717 --> 01:45:52,899
[SPEAKER_02]: A, the Mario games are almost, bar none, some of the best of the year every single time they come out.

1274
01:45:53,199 --> 01:46:01,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you don't hear that about a Madden game, or even about DDR, or whatever serial game you want to talk about, because that Mario 3D world is on point everywhere.

1275
01:46:01,562 --> 01:46:19,664
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know if they can crank out something like that then every year then bring me it every year because that game is fucking amazing uh B Nintendo has tried some other franchises and they flopped Steel Diver have they really tried was that really an attempt they put it out as you know

1276
01:46:21,144 --> 01:46:24,486
[SPEAKER_14]: a somewhat launch title for the 3DS, and then that was it.

1277
01:46:24,526 --> 01:46:26,227
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't support it any further than that.

1278
01:46:26,447 --> 01:46:27,447
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't really a temp.

1279
01:46:27,487 --> 01:46:28,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo Land?

1280
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:31,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Monita isn't exactly going to be an in-demand Smash Bros.

1281
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:32,030
[SPEAKER_02]: character.

1282
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:32,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be real.

1283
01:46:35,351 --> 01:46:36,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Monita's a little done.

1284
01:46:36,612 --> 01:46:38,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Monita's going to get unplugged after that one.

1285
01:46:38,593 --> 01:46:38,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1286
01:46:39,874 --> 01:46:40,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1287
01:46:40,334 --> 01:46:42,135
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think that there's a lot more they could be doing.

1288
01:46:44,055 --> 01:47:11,515
[SPEAKER_14]: uh Final Fantasy Realm Reborn PlayStation 4 version is going to launch April 2014 at least that's what's been announced in Japan well we found when you're going to get your system again Rob right I think it's probably most likely going to probably around the same time for North America as well so that's exciting and that was a 100% completely accurate statement by Jason YYR makes a very good point how about a new Star Fox that plays like Star Fox how about a new F-Zero developed by Nintendo

1289
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:13,541
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1290
01:47:14,121 --> 01:47:20,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here I have some Nintendo news that, you know, might I don't know, might change things a little bit.

1291
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:27,339
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, this one, not really, because Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams could be coming to Wii U in 2014.

1292
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:30,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the new DLC for the Wii U.

1293
01:47:31,544 --> 01:47:32,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Janna Sisters Twisted Dreams

1294
01:47:46,341 --> 01:47:47,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1295
01:47:47,622 --> 01:47:58,328
[SPEAKER_02]: They do say now in an interview with the studio head, Arian Gorsh, says that the Wii U version is more fun than other console versions because it was revised for a cleaner cut.

1296
01:47:58,728 --> 01:48:02,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say the Wii U is the best console for indie releases.

1297
01:48:03,311 --> 01:48:11,736
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what makes this noteworthy, if nothing else, is that, you know, even though some big studios are turning away and shunning the Wii U, some of the indies really, really love it.

1298
01:48:12,656 --> 01:48:15,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other people that really, really love the Wii U, Time Magazine.

1299
01:48:15,918 --> 01:48:37,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually I wouldn't note these types of things, but when it's coming from something that's a little more mainstream and not like gamer or tech focused like Time Magazine, and granted they have different sections, but Time Magazine came out with an article that said, these are 10 reasons why this holiday season you should get a Wii U and not a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One.

1300
01:48:38,431 --> 01:49:04,716
[SPEAKER_02]: and this isn't really something that the media at large is really talking about because everybody's focusing on PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 1 PlayStation 4 and Xbox One like a lot of people kind of already written off Wii U but a time writer Matt Peckham came out and said you know what here's some reasons why you should choose the Wii U it boils down to this number one it has the games you want to play now number two and it'll have the games you want to play next year number three the Wii U gamepad is a

1301
01:49:06,816 --> 01:49:09,858
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little sketch.

1302
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:12,419
[SPEAKER_09]: If by portable you mean within your house, then maybe.

1303
01:49:12,579 --> 01:49:16,601
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm also scratching my head at the games you want to play next year and the games you want to play now.

1304
01:49:16,621 --> 01:49:18,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Because what if those games have to be from EA?

1305
01:49:18,382 --> 01:49:19,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you're not playing those games.

1306
01:49:20,743 --> 01:49:25,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Number four, it is $300, which is $100 less than the PlayStation 4, so it's the cheapest.

1307
01:49:25,606 --> 01:49:28,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Number five, there's no annual subscription fee.

1308
01:49:28,867 --> 01:49:31,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Number six, it's high def enough.

1309
01:49:32,069 --> 01:49:35,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Number seven, Wii U games are cheaper on balance.

1310
01:49:35,412 --> 01:49:37,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that has to do with DLC and all that.

1311
01:49:37,914 --> 01:49:41,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Number eight, Nintendo has the eShop, Sony and Microsoft have NADA.

1312
01:49:41,777 --> 01:49:44,699
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes no sense to me, where he was going with that bullet point.

1313
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:47,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't get that either.

1314
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:48,322
[SPEAKER_12]: I straight up laughed at that one.

1315
01:49:48,922 --> 01:49:51,803
[SPEAKER_14]: This whole article seems kind of, you know, fancy.

1316
01:49:51,823 --> 01:50:05,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes, but I think there's too many people that have written off the Wii U when I think in some ways the Wii U does make a decent case where it could be the system this year and you could wait on the other systems until next year.

1317
01:50:05,926 --> 01:50:08,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it does have more games that are available, period.

1318
01:50:08,787 --> 01:50:09,487
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you what.

1319
01:50:09,887 --> 01:50:09,987
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll...

1320
01:50:11,846 --> 01:50:22,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Since I was such a great marketing person for the PlayStation 4 last week, allow me to provide my services for the Wii U. The Wii U is a good choice for your family.

1321
01:50:22,691 --> 01:50:27,554
[SPEAKER_14]: It has a lot of great family games, especially if you love the Nintendo games that you played a long time ago.

1322
01:50:28,254 --> 01:50:31,055
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to have a lot of your favorite classics and stuff, and that's what you're looking for.

1323
01:50:31,075 --> 01:50:32,376
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be a great console for you.

1324
01:50:32,616 --> 01:50:36,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus, the second screen controller is awesome when someone wants to watch TV or play something else or whatever.

1325
01:50:37,378 --> 01:50:38,859
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great as far as that goes.

1326
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:53,882
[SPEAKER_14]: and yes it is cool that you don't have to pay for an online subscription for their online service so that's a plus and also a lot of the games are going to be cheaper usually then again also there's

1327
01:50:55,276 --> 01:51:03,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I should say a lot more family friendly options for the Wii U and what else could I possibly say?

1328
01:51:04,864 --> 01:51:07,727
[SPEAKER_14]: If you like Mario and Zelda games that much, get one.

1329
01:51:08,207 --> 01:51:17,075
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also the only console that's kind of focused on family gameplay and more local gameplay as well and it's also a console that's very friendly to indie games so you're going to find a lot of

1330
01:51:17,435 --> 01:51:20,558
[SPEAKER_14]: The games that have the same features and kind of gameplay that you...

1331
01:51:42,398 --> 01:51:48,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And then number 10, his reason is that it is more than just a game system with the whole TV and remote integration.

1332
01:51:48,482 --> 01:51:56,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that bullet point's a little bit shaky because, you know, Xbox One, you can do the whole watch TV in your Xbox.

1333
01:51:56,107 --> 01:51:57,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, I don't see where...

1334
01:51:58,368 --> 01:51:59,910
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1335
01:52:18,368 --> 01:52:41,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I say your best option is probably to go PlayStation 3 and Xbox or Xbox 360 they're going to be cheaper than the Wii U there's a lot more games a lot cheaper games out there and they're going to have the games you're going to want to play this year and next year as well plus you can use it for TV and all that other stuff not knocking the Wii U as far as that goes but they just don't they have games that you know they have the Nintendo games and you're only gonna be able to find them there

1336
01:52:43,708 --> 01:53:07,970
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know all right I we got to get past this buy a 3ds there you go uh the things that Nintendo has to work on according to the article just to be fair uh drop the system price again we need a new killer Zelda or Metroid or new Nintendo IP we haven't seen before almost echoing what we just said and needs more third-party games which I really don't know how they're going to get out of that that one it may take throwing money at people we'll see

1337
01:53:08,590 --> 01:53:10,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one other thing I want to talk about.

1338
01:53:10,652 --> 01:53:13,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait a second, I gotta ask here.

1339
01:53:13,234 --> 01:53:15,036
[SPEAKER_14]: It says thanks Colette at the bottom there.

1340
01:53:15,416 --> 01:53:22,583
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the very top, though, it's written by a guy named, you know... This particular website was tipped off from somebody else, probably.

1341
01:53:22,643 --> 01:53:27,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Colette tipped off My Nintendo News about the Time article.

1342
01:53:28,608 --> 01:53:29,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay, got it.

1343
01:53:29,369 --> 01:53:30,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt Peckman.

1344
01:53:31,211 --> 01:53:34,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so that... I should have looked where... I don't know.

1345
01:53:35,074 --> 01:53:36,334
[SPEAKER_14]: It just seemed very vague.

1346
01:53:36,555 --> 01:53:39,796
[SPEAKER_12]: It was very thrown, extended, multiple search, yeah.

1347
01:53:40,256 --> 01:53:40,516
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1348
01:53:40,636 --> 01:53:41,576
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

1349
01:53:42,377 --> 01:53:47,338
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some news about the Typing of the Dead DLC for Typing of the Dead Overkill.

1350
01:53:48,039 --> 01:53:50,540
[SPEAKER_02]: This time, now you might be thinking, Rob, didn't you talk about this last week?

1351
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:52,740
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, this is different because this one is free.

1352
01:53:53,181 --> 01:53:55,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Free DLC as opposed to having to pay for it.

1353
01:53:55,601 --> 01:54:02,104
[SPEAKER_02]: So this DLC will turn the game's phrases into lines of commentary from Football Manager.

1354
01:54:03,044 --> 01:54:04,726
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1355
01:54:23,604 --> 01:54:24,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some stuff.

1356
01:54:26,185 --> 01:54:36,951
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, for fans of the Ys series, there is a fan translation for Ys V that never came out in the US.

1357
01:54:37,111 --> 01:54:39,692
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out in 1995 on the Super Famicom.

1358
01:54:40,132 --> 01:54:50,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And instead of the type of combat that the earlier Ys games had, it was a lot more Zelda-like, for lack of a better description.

1359
01:54:52,200 --> 01:55:02,875
[SPEAKER_09]: and since basically and if I do remember correctly I think it's the same group that did Ys IV Dawn of Ys so if you want it go get it also Ultra Street Fighter IV is

1360
01:55:06,943 --> 01:55:07,724
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1361
01:55:26,676 --> 01:55:54,786
[SPEAKER_09]: so you can get the full bundle however for $40 and I watched the location testing for it some pretty neat stuff Poison actually is pretty badass and then for video games live Akira Yamaoka is going to be at the Dubai show on December 13th so if you're there, film it and send it to me

1362
01:55:56,496 --> 01:55:59,318
[SPEAKER_09]: and stalk him for me because, yeah.

1363
01:55:59,758 --> 01:56:01,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, no, no, no.

1364
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:03,460
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1365
01:56:04,761 --> 01:56:06,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1366
01:56:08,082 --> 01:56:08,283
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1367
01:56:09,363 --> 01:56:16,447
[SPEAKER_12]: He, Yamaoka, did the soundtrack or some aspect thereof to Bioshock?

1368
01:56:19,056 --> 01:56:19,917
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm confused about this.

1369
01:56:20,157 --> 01:56:24,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's just some of the other stuff that they're playing.

1370
01:56:24,141 --> 01:56:25,903
[SPEAKER_12]: That his spin on it could be.

1371
01:56:26,223 --> 01:56:26,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1372
01:56:26,604 --> 01:56:27,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be.

1373
01:56:27,164 --> 01:56:31,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either his spin on it or it's just something that Video Games Live plays the music from that stuff.

1374
01:56:31,208 --> 01:56:33,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I was very confused for a moment to continue.

1375
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:34,291
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's Video Games Live.

1376
01:56:35,132 --> 01:56:35,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1377
01:56:36,113 --> 01:56:38,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into the Fugle question of the week.

1378
01:56:38,836 --> 01:56:41,839
[SPEAKER_02]: You take Facebook, you take Google, you smash it together, you get Fugle.

1379
01:56:50,595 --> 01:56:51,536
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

1380
01:57:10,166 --> 01:57:15,010
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought we'd ask a question about 80s and 90s television shows based on video games and gaming culture.

1381
01:57:15,050 --> 01:57:16,391
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have your favorites, I'm sure.

1382
01:57:16,792 --> 01:57:18,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch any of them growing up?

1383
01:57:18,573 --> 01:57:19,554
[SPEAKER_02]: What were your favorites?

1384
01:57:19,634 --> 01:57:21,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any memories you want to share about those games?

1385
01:57:22,216 --> 01:57:22,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to it.

1386
01:57:23,017 --> 01:57:25,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple answers here over on Google+.

1387
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:30,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Redertainment says, Wait, I thought John Leguizamo died.

1388
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:35,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember John from my first hangover when I watched Land of the Dead because it was on TNT and I didn't want to move.

1389
01:57:35,982 --> 01:57:37,682
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a nice way to spend a Tuesday afternoon.

1390
01:57:38,283 --> 01:57:40,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody else from Land of the Dead died, though.

1391
01:57:40,443 --> 01:57:43,244
[SPEAKER_02]: There was rumors about him a few years ago, but it's not true.

1392
01:57:44,425 --> 01:57:47,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the kid from The Wonder Years is not Marilyn Manson.

1393
01:57:48,366 --> 01:57:50,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And what other big rumors are out there?

1394
01:57:50,927 --> 01:57:51,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1395
01:57:53,188 --> 01:57:57,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft replied on Google+, and says, As many will probably say, I watched the Super Mario Bros.

1396
01:57:57,909 --> 01:58:02,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Show, though I always waited anxiously every Friday for the Legend of Zelda episode.

1397
01:58:03,271 --> 01:58:08,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cheesy as hell, but it was the 80s, so excuse me, princess.

1398
01:58:08,633 --> 01:58:14,015
[SPEAKER_02]: But my favorite video game show or cartoon from back in the 90s is probably Sonic the Hedgehog or Sonic Saturday AM.

1399
01:58:14,395 --> 01:58:16,316
[SPEAKER_02]: That series was freaking awesome.

1400
01:58:17,816 --> 01:58:41,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I also lived for Zelda Fridays myself that was like if I were to answer this question Zelda Fridays were where it was at that and somebody had said it here on Facebook I'll read this answer from Degenerate Johnny this is my other answer if I could name one video game show from my childhood it would be Starrcade it was an 80s game show pun intended that challenged the skills and video game knowledge of gamers which was a real treat to watch

1401
01:58:42,866 --> 01:58:52,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the good old days of G4, the network re-aired old episodes of Starcade, which brought back fond memories I felt when I first saw the show.

1402
01:58:53,113 --> 01:58:54,573
[SPEAKER_02]: That would also be my other answer.

1403
01:58:55,054 --> 01:58:56,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved game shows.

1404
01:58:56,134 --> 01:58:57,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived for game shows growing up.

1405
01:58:57,535 --> 01:59:03,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched Game Show Network when I could, when it was early available, or USA used to show a bunch of old game shows too, I remember that.

1406
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:07,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I loved that show.

1407
01:59:08,122 --> 01:59:09,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly...

1408
01:59:10,263 --> 01:59:19,887
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could do anything in my little broadcasting career, getting to host a remake of Starcade would be my ultimate dream in life.

1409
01:59:20,007 --> 01:59:23,609
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that that's going to be a little bit difficult to do.

1410
01:59:23,729 --> 01:59:27,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you ask me, what do you really want to do more than anything?

1411
01:59:27,751 --> 01:59:34,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to host a resurgence of that show, Starcade, because that show was awesome.

1412
01:59:35,294 --> 01:59:39,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, with arcades kind of on their way out, I don't know.

1413
01:59:39,358 --> 01:59:41,800
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have to be focused on retro games or something.

1414
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:45,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe with the King of Kong and how well that does and all that.

1415
01:59:46,604 --> 01:59:46,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1416
01:59:48,085 --> 01:59:48,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Barcade.

1417
01:59:49,106 --> 01:59:49,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you never know.

1418
01:59:49,687 --> 01:59:50,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a barcade.

1419
01:59:50,972 --> 01:59:58,980
[SPEAKER_02]: let's see some other answers here KJ says very fond memories of GameProTV Captain and the Game Master Super Mario Bros.

1420
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:09,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Show and the short-lived Legend of Zelda cartoon although I used to yell at my TV when those kids were playing video game challenges on Nick Arcade mainly because those kids couldn't play Neo Geo games to save their lives

1421
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:12,231
[SPEAKER_02]: or any other system for that matter.

1422
02:00:35,805 --> 02:00:36,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

1423
02:00:36,866 --> 02:00:37,246
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

1424
02:00:37,386 --> 02:00:37,706
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

1425
02:00:38,927 --> 02:00:39,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1426
02:00:40,447 --> 02:00:48,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth Dream says, I like the crap out of the Qbert cartoon when I was a kid and I still get the theme song from the Pole Position cartoon stuck in my head now and then.

1427
02:00:49,371 --> 02:00:53,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I also liked a Dragon Quest anime called Dragon Warrior that I recorded every week on VHS.

1428
02:00:54,513 --> 02:00:54,973
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1429
02:00:55,454 --> 02:00:57,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually just mentioned Qbert in the chat room.

1430
02:00:57,895 --> 02:00:58,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1431
02:00:58,155 --> 02:01:02,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I used to watch that too because it was sort of like they're on another planet but they're based off of 50s American culture.

1432
02:01:04,165 --> 02:01:04,825
[SPEAKER_09]: and Pac-Man.

1433
02:01:05,505 --> 02:01:16,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Jonko, one of our friends from Koopa Club replied and said I used to watch Captain N every morning before school and then when I came home I'd run around with my NES controller wrapped around my waist like a belt brandishing my zapper.

1434
02:01:16,429 --> 02:01:19,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I convinced myself that I was going to be Captain N when I grew up.

1435
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:23,511
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years later I made it happen through the magic of cosplay.

1436
02:01:24,031 --> 02:01:24,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1437
02:01:24,251 --> 02:01:29,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way I just want to point out Jonko's little icon right now his little user picture is Captain N cosplay.

1438
02:01:30,293 --> 02:01:30,973
[SPEAKER_02]: So props to you.

1439
02:01:32,333 --> 02:01:50,985
[SPEAKER_02]: one more answer here from Ragenator who said yeah I watch stuff like Captain N, Super My Brother Super Show and it's ilk back in the late 80s and early 90s even then I thought that the quality of shows were kind of crappy but considered the overall lack of any real meaningful choices of gaming related programming I felt resigned to picking the less crappy of the crappy

1440
02:01:51,605 --> 02:01:53,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some of the answers from Facebook.

1441
02:01:53,325 --> 02:01:57,826
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to see the rest, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1442
02:01:58,406 --> 02:01:59,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other shows that y'all want to bring up?

1443
02:01:59,907 --> 02:02:01,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the chatter's hit on mine.

1444
02:02:01,807 --> 02:02:02,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was the Pac-Man one.

1445
02:02:03,167 --> 02:02:03,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1446
02:02:04,447 --> 02:02:07,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Even the Christmas special, which I actually went back and watched.

1447
02:02:08,228 --> 02:02:08,708
[SPEAKER_09]: It was horrible.

1448
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:15,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched Captain N. I hated how the characters were characterized, but I loved seeing the different worlds that they'd go to.

1449
02:02:15,950 --> 02:02:17,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought the Game Boy was stupid.

1450
02:02:18,110 --> 02:02:44,467
[SPEAKER_09]: and while it isn't a video game one it's definitely one of those 80s things that had to do with the whole pop music thing was I actually liked kid video do you remember that I do I do and there was another there was another game show where at the end if they did well they would run through and grab like all the video games they could with the velcro vest yes yes what somebody in chattel shouted out I used to watch that every Saturday yeah that was the other big video game show that one was awesome

1451
02:02:44,921 --> 02:03:01,188
[SPEAKER_09]: and then um I watched GameProTV especially when they did the Neo Geo review because I used to have that one on tape and then I moved out here and Dan had a Neo Geo and I was like holy shit these exist you know so it was pretty funny and um

1452
02:03:03,344 --> 02:03:07,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I really liked Pole Position, which I've got all of that downloaded.

1453
02:03:07,968 --> 02:03:08,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Tiger Claw.

1454
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:10,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Video Power was the name of it.

1455
02:03:10,649 --> 02:03:13,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Video Power, that was definitely it.

1456
02:03:14,732 --> 02:03:16,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we used to have a listener named VidPower?

1457
02:03:16,774 --> 02:03:17,094
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

1458
02:03:17,174 --> 02:03:17,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did, yeah.

1459
02:03:19,295 --> 02:03:24,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there was another one that I used to... Nick Arcade?

1460
02:03:25,079 --> 02:03:25,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

1461
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:26,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what about you guys?

1462
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:30,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she's thinking Loki, Jason, anything you want to throw out there?

1463
02:03:30,502 --> 02:03:34,064
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed most of those, and I think that's because I'm just a few years younger than you guys.

1464
02:03:34,184 --> 02:03:36,826
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't... Oh, rub it in.

1465
02:03:36,866 --> 02:03:43,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Nick Arcade, though, I was like a teenager when that was out, so you had to be... Well, that's been rerun to fucking infinity, unlike every other show.

1466
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:43,790
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1467
02:03:44,471 --> 02:03:45,951
[SPEAKER_12]: So Nick Arcade is what I live for.

1468
02:03:45,991 --> 02:03:46,532
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one...

1469
02:03:47,032 --> 02:03:53,256
[SPEAKER_12]: that made me react in similar ways that wasn't actually video game related.

1470
02:03:54,337 --> 02:04:01,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I caught it on Fox Family, ABC, whatever that network has been, called Masters of the Maze.

1471
02:04:03,482 --> 02:04:08,806
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a trivia game and you run through the maze with this big suit and a...

1472
02:04:10,267 --> 02:04:19,255
[SPEAKER_12]: and your assistant uses a joystick to tell you which way to go and you have all these gadgets and doodads on your vest that don't actually do anything and a blind advisor.

1473
02:04:19,335 --> 02:04:20,296
[SPEAKER_12]: It was silly.

1474
02:04:20,836 --> 02:04:22,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I love Nick Arcade.

1475
02:04:23,559 --> 02:04:31,586
[SPEAKER_12]: When I was thinking about shows that I used to watch, PBS had this after school special show called Square One and

1476
02:04:32,246 --> 02:04:32,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes!

1477
02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:35,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That show was the bomb.

1478
02:04:35,871 --> 02:04:37,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Mathman.

1479
02:04:37,753 --> 02:04:38,935
[SPEAKER_12]: That show was the shit.

1480
02:04:38,955 --> 02:04:40,877
[SPEAKER_12]: That came to mind as soon as you guys were talking about Qbert.

1481
02:04:41,078 --> 02:04:41,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And MathNet.

1482
02:04:42,579 --> 02:04:44,602
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of my favorite shows.

1483
02:04:44,722 --> 02:04:47,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to run the fuck home so I could watch Square One.

1484
02:04:47,325 --> 02:04:48,046
[SPEAKER_02]: What a nerd!

1485
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:50,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm running home to watch educational programming, but that show was the shit.

1486
02:04:50,990 --> 02:04:55,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I am glad people are reacting to the show because I've never ever heard of it since I saw it.

1487
02:04:55,193 --> 02:04:56,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, in chat room I'm sure they're lighting up too.

1488
02:04:56,754 --> 02:04:59,136
[SPEAKER_02]: There was that and then 321 Contact was huge.

1489
02:04:59,336 --> 02:05:05,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little too young for Electric Company.

1490
02:05:05,461 --> 02:05:06,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that as much.

1491
02:05:06,582 --> 02:05:08,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I remember Electric Company.

1492
02:05:08,884 --> 02:05:13,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So that one was definitely one for me.

1493
02:05:15,356 --> 02:05:19,284
[SPEAKER_09]: but I'm trying to... Now I'm actually having to pull up a list to remember.

1494
02:05:19,364 --> 02:05:20,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I've got something for Jason.

1495
02:05:20,767 --> 02:05:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready?

1496
02:05:21,207 --> 02:05:21,508
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready?

1497
02:05:21,869 --> 02:05:22,350
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready, Jason?

1498
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:25,416
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already seen this much of Square One TV.

1499
02:05:25,856 --> 02:05:27,039
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you figures left?

1500
02:05:28,584 --> 02:05:29,905
[SPEAKER_02]: This is .44 on the screen.

1501
02:05:29,925 --> 02:05:33,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

1502
02:05:33,807 --> 02:05:36,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Mathman, your mission is to eat only multiples of six.

1503
02:05:36,930 --> 02:05:40,392
[SPEAKER_06]: When you encounter a number, you will have until the count of three to make your decision.

1504
02:05:40,632 --> 02:05:42,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that so, Maddox?

1505
02:05:42,113 --> 02:05:42,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Does he sound like him?

1506
02:05:43,014 --> 02:05:45,035
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll eat you if you are wrong.

1507
02:05:45,195 --> 02:05:46,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, not the glitch.

1508
02:05:46,476 --> 02:05:48,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did they ever turn this into an actual game?

1509
02:05:48,837 --> 02:05:49,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we had...

1510
02:05:49,898 --> 02:05:52,279
[SPEAKER_02]: 72, is that a full six?

1511
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:52,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick.

1512
02:05:52,559 --> 02:05:52,539
72?

1513
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:54,800
[SPEAKER_02]: He ate it.

1514
02:05:55,101 --> 02:05:56,881
[SPEAKER_12]: He's right.

1515
02:05:56,901 --> 02:05:58,422
[SPEAKER_12]: This is why they didn't turn it into a game.

1516
02:05:58,442 --> 02:05:59,263
[SPEAKER_12]: They had number munchers?

1517
02:05:59,283 --> 02:05:59,643
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.

1518
02:06:06,506 --> 02:06:25,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but that wasn't... 844... Okay, so I was looking at other stuff, other ones, Rob, and there was like a really crappy Street Fighter cartoon, American done, that wasn't, you know, actually as good as any of the anime were.

1519
02:06:26,894 --> 02:06:33,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that the, I think that the game was based off of, there was Battletoads, you know, which was pretty funny.

1520
02:06:35,638 --> 02:07:02,272
[SPEAKER_12]: there was a Mortal Kombat cartoon that was really awful and Double Dragon our buddy from Video Game Realness Mega Man 400 is in chat saying no one watched the Mega Man cartoon because nobody mentioned it I caught I remember wanting to watch it I think I caught like five minutes of it while I was it was absurdly early in the morning so I woke up caught a pinch of it and fell back to sleep

1521
02:07:03,137 --> 02:07:04,338
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1522
02:07:20,888 --> 02:07:23,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, I heard about that Yeah, yeah, yeah So it's kind of cool

1523
02:07:37,495 --> 02:07:43,584
[SPEAKER_02]: We are currently being yelled at and lectured by Mega Man 400 and chat for the lack of the Mega Man cartoon.

1524
02:07:44,525 --> 02:07:45,967
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, I guess I'll have to check that out.

1525
02:07:46,208 --> 02:07:47,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I love PBS.

1526
02:07:47,329 --> 02:07:50,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw says there were cartoons that were single shot episodes.

1527
02:07:50,133 --> 02:07:51,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Bubsy had one.

1528
02:07:51,635 --> 02:07:52,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1529
02:07:52,236 --> 02:07:52,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1530
02:07:52,797 --> 02:07:53,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubsy 3D.

1531
02:07:53,766 --> 02:07:54,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft, no.

1532
02:07:55,827 --> 02:07:56,467
[SPEAKER_02]: What does Actdeft say?

1533
02:07:57,007 --> 02:07:58,448
[SPEAKER_12]: I loved Reboot 2 as a kid.

1534
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:00,029
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried to rewatch it on Netflix.

1535
02:08:00,069 --> 02:08:01,529
[SPEAKER_12]: It was terrible.

1536
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:02,510
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1537
02:08:03,190 --> 02:08:03,810
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to move on.

1538
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:05,051
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still more gaming news to get to.

1539
02:08:05,091 --> 02:08:08,833
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do an entire three-hour episode about children's TV shows that we grew up on.

1540
02:08:09,613 --> 02:08:11,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that'll happen over the holidays when it's really slow.

1541
02:08:12,554 --> 02:08:13,635
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be like a good list list.

1542
02:08:13,675 --> 02:08:15,316
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, we got to get to more gaming news.

1543
02:08:15,556 --> 02:08:17,136
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what we just need to do?

1544
02:08:17,556 --> 02:08:19,717
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to do a spinoff show called 30-something radio.

1545
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:22,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1546
02:08:23,141 --> 02:08:25,525
[SPEAKER_02]: The geeks who were in their 30s, the radio show.

1547
02:08:25,565 --> 02:08:26,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

1548
02:08:26,306 --> 02:08:28,409
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be on to something, DarkSakura.

1549
02:08:28,489 --> 02:08:29,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Copyright, Jamie.

1550
02:08:29,771 --> 02:08:30,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Patent pending.

1551
02:08:30,311 --> 02:08:31,012
[SPEAKER_09]: 2013 through 14.

1552
02:08:31,053 --> 02:08:31,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Patent pending.

1553
02:08:34,198 --> 02:09:01,360
[SPEAKER_14]: all rights reserved Loki so the launch of Battlefield 4 hasn't been that great apparently they've had server issues like crazy and DICE has been just kind of trying to get things fixed so to kind of help with that they have halted work on everything but Battlefield 4 so I guess that's going to delay that Mirror's Edge reboot and Star Wars Battlefront

1554
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:04,561
[SPEAKER_14]: and also the expansions for Battlefield 4.

1555
02:09:04,941 --> 02:09:08,542
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to get the game working ASAP.

1556
02:09:09,282 --> 02:09:11,342
[SPEAKER_14]: We know we still have ways to go with fixing the game.

1557
02:09:12,002 --> 02:09:17,264
[SPEAKER_14]: It is absolutely our number one priority and the team at DICE is working non-stop to update the game.

1558
02:09:18,544 --> 02:09:20,845
[SPEAKER_14]: We know players are frustrated and we feel your pain.

1559
02:09:20,925 --> 02:09:22,485
[SPEAKER_14]: We will not stop until this is right.

1560
02:09:23,645 --> 02:09:25,446
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's good to see that they're taking charge.

1561
02:09:25,506 --> 02:09:32,227
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too bad that it took almost two months before they did that.

1562
02:09:32,427 --> 02:09:36,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not a Battlefield 4 player myself, but I have heard there have been some issues.

1563
02:09:36,448 --> 02:09:40,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And Codeman says the servers are shit on PlayStation 4.

1564
02:09:40,629 --> 02:09:42,310
[SPEAKER_02]: EA game and servers are shit?

1565
02:09:44,112 --> 02:09:46,816
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, a lot of games have launch problems.

1566
02:09:46,896 --> 02:09:52,604
[SPEAKER_02]: My beloved Final Fantasy XIV Rome Reborn was kind of a shitacular experience the first couple weeks because of similar issues.

1567
02:09:52,624 --> 02:09:54,687
[SPEAKER_14]: This game's been out for like six weeks now.

1568
02:09:55,532 --> 02:09:56,132
[SPEAKER_02]: No, games?

1569
02:09:56,352 --> 02:10:02,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have a skewed perspective because A, I actually played 1.0, and B, the beta went on for so long.

1570
02:10:03,274 --> 02:10:04,595
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I meant Battlefield 4.

1571
02:10:04,675 --> 02:10:05,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Battlefield.

1572
02:10:05,215 --> 02:10:05,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1573
02:10:05,795 --> 02:10:06,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.

1574
02:10:06,615 --> 02:10:08,896
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they didn't get on it as fast as they should have.

1575
02:10:09,356 --> 02:10:10,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.

1576
02:10:11,237 --> 02:10:11,517
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1577
02:10:12,077 --> 02:10:14,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, moving on with some other news.

1578
02:10:14,998 --> 02:10:18,599
[SPEAKER_02]: This story is about a beloved system of mine, the Commodore 64.

1579
02:10:19,699 --> 02:10:21,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have Commodore 64 news tonight.

1580
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:22,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha!

1581
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:52,337
[SPEAKER_02]: this is cool because Paul Kohler and Mikkel Hastrup who did a port of Super Crate Box which was called Super Bread Box they did a port of Super Hexagon which was a more recent game but they actually ported that to the Commodore 64 so let me actually play a little bit of this in studio it doesn't really do anything at the beginning but then when it gets into the video here a little bit

1582
02:10:54,269 --> 02:10:57,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out that sweet Commodore 64 synth music.

1583
02:10:58,874 --> 02:11:00,816
[SPEAKER_02]: When it gets a little further here in the video, maybe.

1584
02:11:01,196 --> 02:11:05,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can actually play this in an emulator or you can actually play it on a regular system.

1585
02:11:07,623 --> 02:11:07,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1586
02:11:07,943 --> 02:11:08,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm rocking out.

1587
02:11:10,325 --> 02:11:11,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what I'm going to play this week.

1588
02:11:11,667 --> 02:11:13,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Props to you guys for doing this.

1589
02:11:13,589 --> 02:11:15,010
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks great for a Commodore 64 game.

1590
02:11:16,992 --> 02:11:23,637
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if Terry Cavanaugh likes the Commodore 64, considering that these two last titles have been Commodore 64-looking games.

1591
02:11:25,358 --> 02:11:32,943
[SPEAKER_12]: For those who did not know... I think a lot of people... I think a lot of people were influenced by the Commodore 64.

1592
02:11:33,003 --> 02:11:33,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually...

1593
02:11:37,286 --> 02:12:05,461
[SPEAKER_12]: with the exception of educational games and maybe one or two other random things like VET which I talked about three weeks ago I never owned a Commodore 64 so I'm pretty distanced from like tape loading and actually understanding it's extent of basic that you have to use and all that kind of stuff but I loved the games I played on Commodore 64 Space Taxi Beachhead some I want to say it was Top Gun but it was something dogfight like

1594
02:12:06,781 --> 02:12:10,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to play the hell out of this game and it was by the makers of Beachhead.

1595
02:12:10,843 --> 02:12:12,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to do a Let's Remember video for this.

1596
02:12:12,483 --> 02:12:12,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Plug, plug.

1597
02:12:12,923 --> 02:12:13,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll do that this week.

1598
02:12:14,104 --> 02:12:15,064
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good week for YouTube.

1599
02:12:15,364 --> 02:12:16,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1600
02:12:17,705 --> 02:12:19,206
[SPEAKER_02]: It was by the makers of Beachhead.

1601
02:12:19,226 --> 02:12:19,766
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a game.

1602
02:12:19,806 --> 02:12:24,988
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of wrong if you think about it, but it was definitely a relic of the 80s.

1603
02:12:25,028 --> 02:12:26,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a game called Raid Over Moscow.

1604
02:12:27,409 --> 02:12:28,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever play this?

1605
02:12:28,069 --> 02:12:28,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1606
02:12:29,249 --> 02:12:37,254
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a game where, like, literally there's nuclear warheads being launched out of Moscow into America, and you're kind of going to stop it from happening.

1607
02:12:37,894 --> 02:12:40,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of controversial at the time when it came out.

1608
02:12:40,616 --> 02:12:42,597
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I don't know, why are we on this topic?

1609
02:12:42,617 --> 02:12:48,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you got me on Commodore 64 kick, and then you said Beachhead, and I was like, oh, did you know the Beachhead makers made this game?

1610
02:12:48,741 --> 02:12:49,041
[SPEAKER_11]: It's them.

1611
02:12:49,266 --> 02:12:49,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1612
02:12:50,707 --> 02:12:53,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we could just listen to awesome chiptune songs that were made on the Commodore 64.

1613
02:12:53,948 --> 02:12:54,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down for that.

1614
02:12:54,688 --> 02:12:58,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, you know, could somebody write a new OLR theme in the Commodore 64?

1615
02:12:58,510 --> 02:12:59,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Sid Chip, that would be rad.

1616
02:12:59,470 --> 02:13:00,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.

1617
02:13:00,910 --> 02:13:01,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I can ask.

1618
02:13:01,531 --> 02:13:03,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't Bobby do some of that stuff?

1619
02:13:03,852 --> 02:13:04,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, maybe.

1620
02:13:05,032 --> 02:13:05,292
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1621
02:13:06,133 --> 02:13:06,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1622
02:13:06,593 --> 02:13:06,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.

1623
02:13:06,973 --> 02:13:11,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the only one that remembers Dungeon Buster in chat says, that's a great game, remembers that one.

1624
02:13:11,295 --> 02:13:13,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I always flew the plane into the wall.

1625
02:13:13,317 --> 02:13:17,479
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first thing you have to do is fly the plane out of a hangar because, you know, you got to get a plane out there.

1626
02:13:18,079 --> 02:13:21,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always crashed it into the wall because I was seven and awful at video games.

1627
02:13:22,862 --> 02:13:24,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's move on.

1628
02:13:25,003 --> 02:13:26,023
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1629
02:13:26,704 --> 02:13:30,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually, we're still talking about cartoons in chat.

1630
02:13:31,126 --> 02:13:34,168
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will freely admit that I loved Vehicle Voltron.

1631
02:13:35,832 --> 02:13:40,919
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm actually trying to find subtitled copies of Die Ruger 15 that it was based off of.

1632
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got all of Golion, which is fucking depressing.

1633
02:13:44,664 --> 02:13:46,927
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a little bit...

1634
02:13:48,941 --> 02:14:17,701
[SPEAKER_09]: it's related to video games in the terms that it uses the the Kinect but there is a robot called Russell that is it was created by scientists at looks like a Vanderbilt University in Tennessee that uses the Kinect sensor to work with autistic kids and basically and for people who don't really understand autism very well um

1635
02:14:19,915 --> 02:14:31,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, the biggest thing with just about any range of it is having problems with social cues and being overwhelmed very easily by sensory information.

1636
02:14:32,483 --> 02:14:37,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And with looking at a human face, there's a lot of information that a person can miss.

1637
02:14:38,007 --> 02:14:45,752
[SPEAKER_09]: But working into understanding movements and interaction with a robot that has limited forms of interaction itself...

1638
02:14:46,612 --> 02:14:52,174
[SPEAKER_09]: has been helping a lot of these kids acclimatize better into a neurotypical society.

1639
02:14:52,294 --> 02:14:54,734
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty neat.

1640
02:14:54,754 --> 02:15:01,576
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a quote in here from one of the scientists behind it that says autistic children understand the physical world much better than the social world.

1641
02:15:02,337 --> 02:15:07,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So since this isn't as complex as a human being, the child isn't overstimulated.

1642
02:15:07,418 --> 02:15:17,742
[SPEAKER_09]: But the fact that it's using the Kinect to sense the child's movements and react to it is, I'd have to say, a pretty good application for the technology.

1643
02:15:19,663 --> 02:15:19,763
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

1644
02:15:23,366 --> 02:15:35,419
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to hear about what the technology for gaming is kind of doing for good out there, especially when there's been a lot of dogging on Kinect lately because it's a required part of Xbox One and there's really not a lot of games using it.

1645
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:41,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is kind of nice to hear some of these other stories that help kind of, oh, this is why this technology is awesome.

1646
02:15:41,766 --> 02:15:42,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1647
02:15:42,527 --> 02:15:42,627
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1648
02:15:44,869 --> 02:16:02,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that in this case too, like I said, where a human can basically give way too much information for especially a more advanced autistic case, having a robot that's giving much limited information is a lot easier to process and better for integration.

1649
02:16:03,435 --> 02:16:07,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Our robot overlords will be kind to us.

1650
02:16:11,015 --> 02:16:11,435
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1651
02:16:12,035 --> 02:16:12,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1652
02:16:12,536 --> 02:16:13,956
[SPEAKER_02]: A few more stories before we get to the mailbag.

1653
02:16:14,076 --> 02:16:14,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1654
02:16:14,856 --> 02:16:16,137
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1655
02:16:16,357 --> 02:16:22,659
[SPEAKER_14]: So as I mentioned in my gaming week, I did play a little bit of Just Cause 2, the multiplayer mod.

1656
02:16:23,399 --> 02:16:28,681
[SPEAKER_14]: It's right now they're doing their final beta test of the servers and stuff this week.

1657
02:16:29,681 --> 02:16:43,811
[SPEAKER_14]: and it will be launching officially on Steam December 16th and they haven't given a price to it yet I don't know if it's going to be free or if it's just going to be something that there's a fee to but

1658
02:16:45,052 --> 02:17:12,488
[SPEAKER_14]: so far so good and it's pretty fun so look forward to that I guess in a couple weeks and if you can definitely join up in the beta if they haven't closed out yeah I think jc-mp.com and you can sign up there and get a steam key to yeah to get the latest client there so recommend you do that if you haven't already

1659
02:17:14,028 --> 02:17:14,829
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun.

1660
02:17:16,890 --> 02:17:18,952
[SPEAKER_02]: You've talked enough about that here on this program.

1661
02:17:20,913 --> 02:17:22,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Your excitement for it makes me kind of want to play it.

1662
02:17:22,835 --> 02:17:24,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I bet I can get the game super cheap.

1663
02:17:25,016 --> 02:17:27,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike Grand Theft Auto 5, it's still a little pricey.

1664
02:17:27,959 --> 02:17:39,167
[SPEAKER_12]: I skipped Just Cause 1, but Just Cause 2 is the longest adventure hunt collectible game that I've played ever.

1665
02:17:39,507 --> 02:17:40,888
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got to...

1666
02:17:43,189 --> 02:18:06,194
[SPEAKER_12]: 94, 95, maybe 96% completion finished the story started a second playthrough like this game is one that I'm actually going through completion on the frustrating part is that the game is bugged and you literally cannot reasonably get 100% collection in that game but this sounds fucking awesome so sad it's Windows only PC only and Windows only

1667
02:18:07,702 --> 02:18:15,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's a game that you'll probably only be able to experience on PC only pretty soon, although not if the publishers are able to get their way.

1668
02:18:15,364 --> 02:18:18,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Skullgirls, which I know a lot of people have been talking about.

1669
02:18:19,345 --> 02:18:23,087
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is by publisher Autumn Games, and here's the thing.

1670
02:18:23,527 --> 02:18:34,450
[SPEAKER_02]: They are terminating their business deal with Konami, because Konami was the ones that actually got the game distributed and got it onto the Xbox Live Arcade and onto the PlayStation Network.

1671
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:39,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because they are severing their ties with Konami, Konami has asked that the games be delisted.

1672
02:18:39,793 --> 02:18:47,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So Skullgirls will be removed from the PlayStation Network on December 17th and off Xbox Live Arcade before the end of the year when the contract expires.

1673
02:18:47,999 --> 02:18:52,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, unfortunately, what's happening with this whole thing is that...

1674
02:18:54,102 --> 02:19:02,824
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to replace Skullgirls with a different self-published build that actually has some of the improvements that the PC update had in it.

1675
02:19:03,184 --> 02:19:21,389
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to get that out ASAP, but I get the sense they might have been blindsided by this a little bit, that this was going to happen so fast, because the design director for Skullgirls, Mike Zamet, said that the delisting is kind of like Final Fantasy VI's magic user casting Ultima before he dies.

1676
02:19:21,409 --> 02:19:22,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1677
02:19:24,016 --> 02:19:42,710
[SPEAKER_02]: so it is a bit of a thing but I mean if you're going to end an agreement these things are going to happen so I'm not really sure what to think in this particular scenario I just hope that the well I think it's good that they're going to kind of at least make the new version a little better and they're going to bring some of the improvements over

1678
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:43,831
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1679
02:19:59,569 --> 02:20:09,236
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe they can kind of make lemonade out of lemons or whatever the hell you want to call it by kind of using this as like another way to kind of relaunch the game and get it out there.

1680
02:20:09,676 --> 02:20:12,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager.

1681
02:20:13,799 --> 02:20:15,960
[SPEAKER_02]: When life gives you lemons, you mix it with vodka.

1682
02:20:18,963 --> 02:20:20,684
[SPEAKER_12]: And then burn their house down with the lemons.

1683
02:20:23,144 --> 02:20:23,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, I like this guy.

1684
02:20:24,004 --> 02:20:25,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Squirted in their eyes.

1685
02:20:25,805 --> 02:20:26,105
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1686
02:20:27,205 --> 02:20:29,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel to the mailbag.

1687
02:20:31,266 --> 02:20:33,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew Actdeft was a fan of Skullgirls, by the way.

1688
02:20:33,586 --> 02:20:35,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft in chat says, support the Steam version.

1689
02:20:35,807 --> 02:20:37,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do still have a way you can support this game, if something.

1690
02:20:38,207 --> 02:20:38,407
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1691
02:20:38,827 --> 02:20:39,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually tempted to get it.

1692
02:20:40,368 --> 02:20:40,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

1693
02:20:40,788 --> 02:20:41,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1694
02:20:41,728 --> 02:20:42,208
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks fun.

1695
02:20:42,248 --> 02:20:43,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had a chance to grab it yet.

1696
02:20:44,008 --> 02:20:47,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a couple of friends on my Tumblr who were super obsessed with Skullgirls.

1697
02:20:47,829 --> 02:20:51,830
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know a lot more about the backstory of the game without ever having played it.

1698
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:52,450
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1699
02:20:52,930 --> 02:20:53,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

1700
02:20:56,211 --> 02:20:57,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you guys email us.

1701
02:20:57,531 --> 02:21:00,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails.

1702
02:21:00,972 --> 02:21:02,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And the DarkSakura will go to the email bag.

1703
02:21:02,732 --> 02:21:04,072
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to dive in head first.

1704
02:21:04,632 --> 02:21:05,453
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sticky!

1705
02:21:06,713 --> 02:21:07,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross.

1706
02:21:08,293 --> 02:21:10,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's going to see what emails are in there tonight.

1707
02:21:10,794 --> 02:21:11,814
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot tonight, right, Jenny?

1708
02:21:11,834 --> 02:21:14,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, we got one from an old school listener.

1709
02:21:14,794 --> 02:21:16,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, I love old school listeners.

1710
02:21:16,295 --> 02:21:20,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember... I love new school ones too, though, for the record.

1711
02:21:20,076 --> 02:21:21,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember Asian Buddy Paul?

1712
02:21:21,736 --> 02:21:21,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1713
02:21:22,616 --> 02:21:27,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR, I was talking about gaming news at work one day and wondered how the podcast was doing.

1714
02:21:27,499 --> 02:21:29,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you guys are still going very strong.

1715
02:21:29,701 --> 02:21:30,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's from Asian Buddy Paul.

1716
02:21:33,063 --> 02:21:35,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That literally was an email just saying hey.

1717
02:21:36,585 --> 02:21:37,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Sup, OLR?

1718
02:21:38,267 --> 02:21:38,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Sup, bro?

1719
02:21:39,607 --> 02:21:40,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Sup, bitches?

1720
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:43,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're still here.

1721
02:21:44,010 --> 02:21:44,811
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just a little older.

1722
02:21:46,634 --> 02:22:05,343
[SPEAKER_09]: This comes from Robert M Last episode you were musing about dubstep Christmas music I got a sample music track a year ago The Capital Kings version of Carol of the Bells Easily one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard I have heard that Pause for Rob to look it up on YouTube and play a podcast Oh my god, that's exactly what I was doing And for Jamie's ears to recover

1723
02:22:05,563 --> 02:22:14,705
[SPEAKER_14]: They have that, actually, at this... There's a court nearby that decorates lights in all their houses, and they have one guy that has that synced up to music.

1724
02:22:14,805 --> 02:22:15,906
[SPEAKER_14]: That song, actually.

1725
02:22:15,926 --> 02:22:19,647
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I saw this in a YouTube ad, of all things.

1726
02:22:20,767 --> 02:22:21,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Just in the last couple of days.

1727
02:22:21,967 --> 02:22:23,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, silly YouTube.

1728
02:22:23,828 --> 02:22:26,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, let me get... Let me get to it.

1729
02:22:26,708 --> 02:22:27,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here we go.

1730
02:22:27,529 --> 02:22:29,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll skip ahead a little bit in the song here.

1731
02:22:32,424 --> 02:22:34,527
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't sound anything too crazy.

1732
02:22:34,547 --> 02:22:35,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me skip a little further.

1733
02:22:35,770 --> 02:22:36,931
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1734
02:22:36,952 --> 02:22:42,801
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the buildup.

1735
02:22:42,821 --> 02:22:43,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1736
02:22:51,796 --> 02:22:53,600
[SPEAKER_14]: That should be right there.

1737
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:56,907
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I want to record on all of my Christmas cards.

1738
02:22:56,947 --> 02:22:58,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they have the audio Christmas cards and stuff like that.

1739
02:22:59,132 --> 02:22:59,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Right there.

1740
02:22:59,552 --> 02:23:00,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Merry Christmas!

1741
02:23:00,735 --> 02:23:02,458
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it drops to the bass right there.

1742
02:23:05,515 --> 02:23:06,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, maybe it wasn't that one.

1743
02:23:06,657 --> 02:23:10,782
[SPEAKER_14]: He had actually a really cool Christmas song that was dubstep, but I don't think it was that.

1744
02:23:11,003 --> 02:23:12,044
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't very good.

1745
02:23:12,865 --> 02:23:17,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

1746
02:23:18,953 --> 02:23:21,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Which brings me to this most likely non-video game question.

1747
02:23:22,578 --> 02:23:26,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there Christmas music you enjoy any time of the year, regardless of your own traditions?

1748
02:23:27,221 --> 02:23:37,387
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, it's the Sonic Santa Claus and They Might Be Giants cover, Takosky's Nutcracker Suite, and of course, Vince Giardi's Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack.

1749
02:23:37,567 --> 02:23:38,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the great show.

1750
02:23:41,529 --> 02:23:43,150
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I hate Christmas music, to be honest.

1751
02:23:43,811 --> 02:23:44,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do.

1752
02:23:44,731 --> 02:23:45,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I never liked it.

1753
02:23:46,772 --> 02:23:48,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Except Bing Crosby.

1754
02:23:48,493 --> 02:23:49,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the crooners.

1755
02:23:49,373 --> 02:23:51,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a little bit annoyed with it.

1756
02:23:51,174 --> 02:23:52,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that I really hate Christmas music.

1757
02:23:52,714 --> 02:23:53,975
[SPEAKER_02]: It just goes on too long.

1758
02:23:53,995 --> 02:23:56,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Christmas music should be like... I'm tired of Mariah Carey.

1759
02:23:56,696 --> 02:23:58,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The week of Christmas.

1760
02:23:58,937 --> 02:23:59,397
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1761
02:24:00,137 --> 02:24:03,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Not December 1st and certainly not the day after Halloween.

1762
02:24:03,878 --> 02:24:04,699
[SPEAKER_02]: The week of Christmas.

1763
02:24:04,739 --> 02:24:05,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough.

1764
02:24:06,899 --> 02:24:08,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got kind of a weird one that I like.

1765
02:24:10,180 --> 02:24:14,362
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually like the soundtrack to Toys.

1766
02:24:15,077 --> 02:24:18,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Toys had a really good soundtrack.

1767
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:21,542
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not really Christmas, but they had Christmas themes in there.

1768
02:24:22,103 --> 02:24:25,786
[SPEAKER_12]: It was light and fluffy and airy for some of the songs.

1769
02:24:25,826 --> 02:24:26,947
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Tori Amos, too.

1770
02:24:28,428 --> 02:24:29,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Did a couple tracks.

1771
02:24:29,489 --> 02:24:34,212
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the one that they had the choir of kids singing or something like that.

1772
02:24:34,312 --> 02:24:35,513
[SPEAKER_14]: That one's pretty cool.

1773
02:24:36,434 --> 02:24:36,975
[SPEAKER_14]: and Hans Zimmer.

1774
02:24:36,995 --> 02:24:38,316
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Hans Zimmer is fucking awesome.

1775
02:24:38,356 --> 02:24:38,976
[SPEAKER_14]: What can you say?

1776
02:24:39,637 --> 02:24:41,018
[SPEAKER_09]: For the record, there is a Hanukkah song.

1777
02:24:41,178 --> 02:24:52,928
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually a couple of Hanukkah songs I will listen to and one of them is the Maccabeats music rewrite for Candlelight and I will listen to Miracle because I freaking just love Matas Yahoo anyway.

1778
02:24:53,089 --> 02:24:53,569
[SPEAKER_09]: He's awesome.

1779
02:24:53,969 --> 02:24:54,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy shit.

1780
02:24:54,630 --> 02:24:57,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't realize there were so many great artists on this.

1781
02:24:57,252 --> 02:24:58,954
[SPEAKER_14]: They had Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

1782
02:24:58,994 --> 02:25:00,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't even fucking know he was on that.

1783
02:25:00,575 --> 02:25:01,516
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty sweet.

1784
02:25:03,276 --> 02:25:11,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have you know, I am getting lectured in a private message by Shane Alinko about dissing Christmas music, apparently, which I just did.

1785
02:25:12,442 --> 02:25:18,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane Alinko, by the way, bought Skylanders on the PlayStation 4 this week just so he could get his Christmas Skylanders character.

1786
02:25:18,725 --> 02:25:19,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1787
02:25:19,306 --> 02:25:20,787
[SPEAKER_02]: That boy is obsessed with Christmas.

1788
02:25:21,647 --> 02:25:24,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just been ignoring all my villagers talking about Jingle.

1789
02:25:25,429 --> 02:25:27,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Except I'm writing down what presents they want for Toy Day.

1790
02:25:27,831 --> 02:25:31,133
[SPEAKER_14]: You know they are selling that Skylander character separately

1791
02:25:32,236 --> 02:25:33,857
[SPEAKER_14]: In a couple weeks, by the way.

1792
02:25:35,857 --> 02:25:39,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Ikuma JP says, oh my god, in Japan, all Mariah Carey, all the way.

1793
02:25:40,039 --> 02:25:41,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate shops that play that song.

1794
02:25:42,059 --> 02:25:42,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1795
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:44,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Kmart has been playing it on repeat.

1796
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:47,962
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only reason I'm going to Kmart is because it's right around the corner from my freaking house.

1797
02:25:48,802 --> 02:25:50,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were the only place that had long underwear.

1798
02:25:50,322 --> 02:25:57,345
[SPEAKER_12]: There was another one, Boy George, that's a big favorite in Japan, too.

1799
02:25:59,607 --> 02:26:01,008
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a Christmas track I will listen to.

1800
02:26:01,849 --> 02:26:04,692
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Pet Shop Boys, all over the world.

1801
02:26:05,993 --> 02:26:06,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas Mix.

1802
02:26:07,515 --> 02:26:09,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you need to find that for me because I will listen to that one.

1803
02:26:11,018 --> 02:26:12,399
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no more Christmas music.

1804
02:26:12,439 --> 02:26:12,960
[SPEAKER_02]: What's next?

1805
02:26:15,442 --> 02:26:17,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of long email from AZHP.

1806
02:26:17,264 --> 02:26:17,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go ahead and read it.

1807
02:26:18,925 --> 02:26:19,625
[SPEAKER_02]: He writes good stuff.

1808
02:26:19,805 --> 02:26:20,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR crew.

1809
02:26:20,846 --> 02:26:24,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I should channel my mother and use the accent.

1810
02:26:24,847 --> 02:26:25,848
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just read the email.

1811
02:26:26,208 --> 02:26:26,968
[SPEAKER_09]: AZHP here.

1812
02:26:27,548 --> 02:26:34,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I just listened to that bit at the top of this week's show where a listener wrote in saying you guys shouldn't be biased towards Sony or against Xbox.

1813
02:26:35,511 --> 02:26:36,972
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a load of crap.

1814
02:26:38,032 --> 02:26:39,073
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1815
02:27:03,351 --> 02:27:06,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki has like four Xbox 360s.

1816
02:27:06,455 --> 02:27:08,957
[SPEAKER_09]: He plays GTA 4 every day on one.

1817
02:27:09,618 --> 02:27:12,822
[SPEAKER_09]: So why shouldn't he be upset that Microsoft borked the Xbox One launch?

1818
02:27:13,563 --> 02:27:18,608
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be more surprising if he wasn't upset about it because he feels so passionately about the company.

1819
02:27:19,009 --> 02:27:20,150
[SPEAKER_09]: We hate because we love.

1820
02:27:22,438 --> 02:27:22,838
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1821
02:27:42,632 --> 02:27:42,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1822
02:28:08,044 --> 02:28:10,445
[SPEAKER_09]: We, um, again, we hate because we love.

1823
02:28:11,085 --> 02:28:16,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's a little bit biased, but we're biased because we know what we want in our hearts, and when we get it, we're happy.

1824
02:28:17,406 --> 02:28:20,087
[SPEAKER_09]: But we don't, but when we don't get it, we're unhappy.

1825
02:28:20,567 --> 02:28:21,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for reading my email.

1826
02:28:21,687 --> 02:28:29,128
[SPEAKER_09]: As someone who has listened to this show on and off since its beginnings, I couldn't sit by and watch someone leave the show just because you guys were, quote, biased.

1827
02:28:29,228 --> 02:28:30,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's biased.

1828
02:28:30,369 --> 02:28:31,629
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where our opinions come from.

1829
02:28:31,769 --> 02:28:32,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Deal with it.

1830
02:28:32,309 --> 02:28:33,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Yours truly is H.P.

1831
02:28:33,669 --> 02:28:35,450
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR's premier gold star recipient.

1832
02:28:36,911 --> 02:28:37,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1833
02:28:39,404 --> 02:28:44,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for remembering more than I do about the history of the show and some of the things we said.

1834
02:28:44,927 --> 02:28:50,151
[SPEAKER_02]: But my one little thing is that I think the beginning of the email said something like, well, I think that's crap or whatever.

1835
02:28:50,211 --> 02:28:53,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's not forget, you know, we got to respect everybody's opinions or whatever.

1836
02:28:53,953 --> 02:29:01,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would just hate for the person who was just trying to give honest feedback last week to feel like, you know, like now everybody's picking on somebody for their opinion.

1837
02:29:01,758 --> 02:29:02,499
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.

1838
02:29:02,559 --> 02:29:04,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to make sure it's very clear to their opinion.

1839
02:29:04,901 --> 02:29:05,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1840
02:29:05,641 --> 02:29:05,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1841
02:29:06,021 --> 02:29:07,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's entitled to their opinion, period.

1842
02:29:07,882 --> 02:29:08,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make that.

1843
02:29:09,364 --> 02:29:13,607
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go to the next email now though.

1844
02:29:13,967 --> 02:29:16,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well I'm asking permission if I can thank somebody on air.

1845
02:29:16,849 --> 02:29:17,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1846
02:29:17,470 --> 02:29:18,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone just did something super nice for me.

1847
02:29:18,811 --> 02:29:20,672
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll go ahead and read this email.

1848
02:29:21,112 --> 02:29:23,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week's opening was very thought-provoking.

1849
02:29:23,554 --> 02:29:27,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that OLR is centric to any specific console or platform.

1850
02:29:28,038 --> 02:29:33,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that many of the viewpoints we hear on OLR are representative of the core gaming community overall.

1851
02:29:34,442 --> 02:29:39,065
[SPEAKER_09]: though not necessarily representative of the more ambiguous and generic gaming umbrella.

1852
02:29:39,506 --> 02:29:43,228
[SPEAKER_09]: The PS4 offers little to no change from what gamers have largely grown accustomed to.

1853
02:29:43,688 --> 02:29:47,671
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't threaten the status quo and I think that it is very appealing to core gamers.

1854
02:29:48,231 --> 02:29:55,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I can to a large extent understand why the ire against Xbox Ones is so pervasive on gaming sites, forums, and podcasts.

1855
02:29:56,537 --> 02:30:01,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Anecdotally, people who spend no time on these types of sites don't share a similar attitude.

1856
02:30:02,041 --> 02:30:03,762
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, this is written very well.

1857
02:30:04,142 --> 02:30:06,367
[SPEAKER_09]: with great grammar, although I do miss the Oxford comma.

1858
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:18,492
[SPEAKER_09]: As gamers, I find that our community often, and perhaps the internet in general, loves to revel in negative news.

1859
02:30:19,052 --> 02:30:25,494
[SPEAKER_09]: To that end, I can agree with the poster that it can be depressing to be inundated with a wet blanket attitude even in the midst of a console launch.

1860
02:30:25,874 --> 02:30:28,975
[SPEAKER_09]: A very rare and exciting time, in my opinion.

1861
02:30:29,656 --> 02:30:33,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not suggesting that we should ignore the negativity and all slide down a magical rainbow while holding hands.

1862
02:30:34,297 --> 02:30:34,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that sounds fun.

1863
02:30:35,557 --> 02:30:36,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Only if there's sheet cake involved.

1864
02:30:37,598 --> 02:30:47,727
[SPEAKER_09]: What I am saying is that we also sit back and smile once in a while with the amazing choices we have as gamers on nearly every platform and at a variety of entry points and simply marvel.

1865
02:30:48,427 --> 02:30:59,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time I even think about getting bitter, my son reminds me how much he loves Mario Cat, Super Mario 3D Land, and how he wants a Pokemon party for his next birthday and I realize that gaming is still as great as we want it to be.

1866
02:31:00,157 --> 02:31:01,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Hugs and kisses to OLR, DarkCharger.

1867
02:31:02,233 --> 02:31:02,814
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1868
02:31:22,495 --> 02:31:22,835
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

1869
02:31:43,084 --> 02:31:45,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it is an exciting time.

1870
02:31:45,085 --> 02:31:46,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Moments like this don't come around very often.

1871
02:31:47,386 --> 02:31:52,489
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think from E3, this whole conversation has been very charged.

1872
02:31:52,889 --> 02:32:03,714
[SPEAKER_02]: What was very different about last time is that when it was Sony and Nintendo launching in the same month, you know, everybody was hazing Sony because, oh, Sony's looking like a bunch of crayon eaters right now.

1873
02:32:04,195 --> 02:32:05,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And, wow, Nintendo's kind of doing something different.

1874
02:32:06,016 --> 02:32:09,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was the mindset of the internet, quote unquote, back then.

1875
02:32:10,118 --> 02:32:10,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Now...

1876
02:32:11,138 --> 02:32:23,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure you've got your Xbox and your Sony fanboys and granted Microsoft made a lot of missteps at E3 but what really was different this time was Sony calling them out.

1877
02:32:24,444 --> 02:32:30,487
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a key difference and that's caused there to be a little more sting in this whole war.

1878
02:32:30,867 --> 02:32:35,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can trace that back to that very moment when Sony made the YouTube

1879
02:32:36,429 --> 02:32:41,270
[SPEAKER_02]: of how to play used games on the PlayStation 4 where one dude handed the game to the other.

1880
02:32:42,590 --> 02:32:51,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know we're not quite to the point where we look back on the biggest news stories of the year, but I would say the release of that YouTube was the biggest news story of 2013.

1881
02:32:52,452 --> 02:33:04,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably end up saying that again at the end of the year, was when Sony themselves put out a video of how to trade a used game on the PlayStation 4 because that was just, you didn't see that last gen, that kind of slapping, basically.

1882
02:33:05,555 --> 02:33:05,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1883
02:33:06,675 --> 02:33:07,156
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1884
02:33:08,496 --> 02:33:10,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I am defending my love of Digimon Zero 2.

1885
02:33:12,018 --> 02:33:12,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Random.

1886
02:33:12,638 --> 02:33:13,859
[SPEAKER_09]: But only the Japanese version.

1887
02:33:13,979 --> 02:33:14,859
[SPEAKER_09]: I really liked that one.

1888
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:15,920
[SPEAKER_09]: The movies were great.

1889
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:16,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1890
02:33:17,781 --> 02:33:21,223
[SPEAKER_09]: This one comes from Ye Olde Ragenator.

1891
02:33:23,064 --> 02:33:24,264
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, you know how that began?

1892
02:33:24,324 --> 02:33:25,165
[SPEAKER_09]: The Ye Olde thing?

1893
02:33:26,325 --> 02:33:26,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Typography.

1894
02:33:27,926 --> 02:33:33,189
[SPEAKER_09]: There used to be a letter that they did not have a type for and it looked very similar to the Y so they used that.

1895
02:33:33,629 --> 02:33:35,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why we have Ye Olde and not The Olde.

1896
02:33:35,330 --> 02:33:36,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to ye olde next email.

1897
02:33:56,654 --> 02:34:05,480
[SPEAKER_09]: and easily understandable way to refer to a generation of consoles rather than going the long-winded route of saying something like the 360 slash PS3 slash Wii generation.

1898
02:34:07,561 --> 02:34:16,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, with Steam's winter sale presumably starting within the next few days, what games do the three of you think should be on everyone's radar and should be bought if it goes on sale?

1899
02:34:19,467 --> 02:34:23,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was a game on my list, but Codeman got it for me.

1900
02:34:23,569 --> 02:34:23,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1901
02:34:23,869 --> 02:34:25,670
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to be playing Skullgirls when I get home.

1902
02:34:25,790 --> 02:34:26,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

1903
02:34:26,710 --> 02:34:27,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky you.

1904
02:34:27,290 --> 02:34:27,650
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1905
02:34:27,670 --> 02:34:28,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Lucky me.

1906
02:34:28,051 --> 02:34:29,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1907
02:34:29,111 --> 02:34:29,952
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a nice boy.

1908
02:34:30,172 --> 02:34:30,772
[SPEAKER_09]: He is.

1909
02:34:31,992 --> 02:34:32,433
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair.

1910
02:34:32,453 --> 02:34:33,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Mothers everywhere should approve of him.

1911
02:34:34,113 --> 02:34:40,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him a little gift on behalf of the show earlier this week, so I'm glad to see he's paying it forward.

1912
02:34:40,136 --> 02:34:40,777
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very kind.

1913
02:34:43,078 --> 02:34:44,379
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was I going to say with that?

1914
02:34:44,439 --> 02:34:47,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Steam games should Ragenator be on the lookout for?

1915
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:48,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that basically the gist of what I'm hearing?

1916
02:34:48,861 --> 02:34:50,902
[SPEAKER_09]: What we are on the lookout for, I guess.

1917
02:34:51,363 --> 02:34:52,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm probably going to get Final Fantasy XIII.

1918
02:34:52,543 --> 02:34:54,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it should be out by then.

1919
02:34:55,453 --> 02:34:55,993
[SPEAKER_02]: On PC?

1920
02:34:56,173 --> 02:34:58,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they were saying that there should be a PC release.

1921
02:34:58,434 --> 02:34:59,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know they were doing a PC release.

1922
02:34:59,415 --> 02:34:59,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there was.

1923
02:34:59,835 --> 02:35:00,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sure?

1924
02:35:00,375 --> 02:35:01,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I read it somewhere.

1925
02:35:01,516 --> 02:35:03,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would have been out by now if that was the case.

1926
02:35:03,917 --> 02:35:06,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well then, Dan's the one that told me about it, so.

1927
02:35:07,599 --> 02:35:08,559
[SPEAKER_02]: What have I been keeping my eye on?

1928
02:35:08,639 --> 02:35:12,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up buying, like, Stanley Parable was something I was going to get, and I did get that.

1929
02:35:12,281 --> 02:35:13,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Gone Home I ended up getting.

1930
02:35:13,581 --> 02:35:14,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Spelunky I ended up getting.

1931
02:35:15,102 --> 02:35:19,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, all the games I had on my watch list I ended up getting this past sale.

1932
02:35:19,404 --> 02:35:19,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1933
02:35:20,604 --> 02:35:33,031
[SPEAKER_02]: If Final Fantasy VIII goes on sale, I will buy it for the sole purpose of giving it another chance, especially with this thing that Loki was talking about where you can fix the magic system and only have to draw once, even if it's cheating, quote-unquote.

1934
02:35:33,851 --> 02:35:37,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's how I play through the game now that I think about it.

1935
02:35:37,973 --> 02:35:39,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll probably get it too if it goes on sale.

1936
02:35:39,694 --> 02:35:40,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one I'd be looking forward to.

1937
02:35:40,935 --> 02:35:41,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why I...

1938
02:35:42,876 --> 02:35:43,196
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1939
02:35:43,276 --> 02:35:49,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I did look this up, and it wasn't 13, but Dan had mentioned something to me, and I think I had it stuck in my head.

1940
02:35:49,842 --> 02:35:52,564
[SPEAKER_09]: But I almost picked it up for Xbox.

1941
02:35:55,466 --> 02:36:00,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually loading up Steam right now to see if there's anything that jumps out of my mind.

1942
02:36:00,270 --> 02:36:02,292
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like something I was waiting on to get.

1943
02:36:02,392 --> 02:36:04,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Officially released Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

1944
02:36:05,374 --> 02:36:05,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1945
02:36:06,975 --> 02:36:26,737
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not on Steam but Grand Theft Auto 5 Hotline Miami is on sale right now which I have and it's fun I think I got that in an indie bundle I completely forgot that I for that for my gaming week I actually started playing Hotline Miami I forgot my gaming week Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed was free this weekend on Steam and I played that too because it was free yeah so it's on sale right now too

1946
02:36:27,057 --> 02:36:30,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, Ragenator, I think everything I wanted I really bought in this last sale.

1947
02:36:30,579 --> 02:36:34,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there will be more indie games that I see little screenshots of and I'll be like, ooh, I want that.

1948
02:36:34,822 --> 02:36:35,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I want that.

1949
02:36:35,403 --> 02:36:41,387
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a couple that appealed to me, but I think for right now, like that Ring Runner one actually looked interesting.

1950
02:36:43,488 --> 02:36:47,491
[SPEAKER_09]: But for right now, I still have The Shiva to play.

1951
02:36:47,751 --> 02:36:49,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Skullgirls to play.

1952
02:36:49,732 --> 02:36:50,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Deadpool to play.

1953
02:36:50,673 --> 02:36:51,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1954
02:36:51,834 --> 02:36:56,237
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're probably never going to see me on Final Fantasy again because there's other shit to play.

1955
02:36:58,098 --> 02:37:11,131
[SPEAKER_09]: but then patch 2.1 will hit and it'll be like I need to just freaking get past level 31 so that I can do that stupid quest that I'm stuck on my Arcanist job quest anyway, whatever 3.

1956
02:37:12,512 --> 02:37:21,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy 8's recent release on Steam yay, Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy 8, meh or Final Fantasy 8, fuck that shit I think we just answered that question

1957
02:37:22,671 --> 02:37:29,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't... I mean, I realized there was a little bit of a Twitter debate earlier this week that I got caught up in, and, you know, I kind of started it, so I deserved it.

1958
02:37:30,093 --> 02:37:34,675
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't despise Final Fantasy VIII by many means.

1959
02:37:34,855 --> 02:37:39,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel a few key flaws in that game really ruin the fun.

1960
02:37:39,856 --> 02:37:42,538
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I don't remember it as fondly as the others.

1961
02:37:42,798 --> 02:37:43,879
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has a good story.

1962
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:55,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, it was especially considering you could have made a game that was very similar to 7 when 7 did so well, but they didn't and they went a very different direction with the story and I do applaud them for that.

1963
02:37:58,292 --> 02:38:03,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to be nice, y'all, but it's still the worst Final Fantasy game next to 14 1.0.

1964
02:38:03,496 --> 02:38:03,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1965
02:38:03,916 --> 02:38:05,057
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how I feel.

1966
02:38:05,097 --> 02:38:05,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Opinions, I have them.

1967
02:38:06,418 --> 02:38:10,260
[SPEAKER_09]: They did bring up the Tamagotchi and handheld Digimon.

1968
02:38:10,300 --> 02:38:15,123
[SPEAKER_09]: They were both brought out by Bandai, which the Tamagotchi came out first, then Digimon came so that you could battle.

1969
02:38:15,223 --> 02:38:16,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the little ones.

1970
02:38:16,584 --> 02:38:22,068
[SPEAKER_09]: The handheld LCD Digimon battler things.

1971
02:38:22,588 --> 02:38:23,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I was like,

1972
02:38:24,029 --> 02:38:29,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I remember naming my, because I evolved a Devimon first, and I remember calling him Satan Common.

1973
02:38:30,813 --> 02:38:33,135
[SPEAKER_09]: That was his name, and I thought I would name a dog that.

1974
02:38:34,255 --> 02:38:38,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Four, I'm thinking of establishing a weekly VOG night on Counter-Strike Global Offensive on Steam.

1975
02:38:39,238 --> 02:38:43,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that unlike TF2, it isn't free, but it will likely be on sale soon.

1976
02:38:44,341 --> 02:38:48,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Would be there are any takers available?

1977
02:38:48,564 --> 02:38:49,925
[SPEAKER_12]: This email is brought to you by StarFlex64.

1978
02:38:49,945 --> 02:38:50,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Do a barrel roll.

1979
02:39:11,383 --> 02:39:39,830
[SPEAKER_09]: and last email which by the way we did have one from YYR but I he said he'd call later I have paid attention to the chat yes and I'm honoring the previous statement alright live is better hi OLR crew I said hi firstly that's what it says here firstly thank you all for giving me a theme song Sky made a great choice with conga feeling though I'm waiting for the day he screws up and plays Miami Sound Machine's conga by accident laughing

1980
02:39:41,164 --> 02:39:42,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I got a better one.

1981
02:39:42,045 --> 02:39:43,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I got an even better one.

1982
02:39:43,106 --> 02:39:43,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a minute.

1983
02:39:43,967 --> 02:39:44,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.

1984
02:39:44,407 --> 02:39:45,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play a theme song here at the end.

1985
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:47,971
[SPEAKER_09]: But enough about you guys.

1986
02:39:48,011 --> 02:39:49,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here to ask your pal Jason.

1987
02:39:50,553 --> 02:39:54,337
[SPEAKER_09]: One, since Jason is now doing intros, is he being paid in peanuts or Oreos?

1988
02:39:54,678 --> 02:39:55,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I did give him a candy cane.

1989
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:57,881
[SPEAKER_02]: He drinks some of our juice.

1990
02:40:01,004 --> 02:40:02,926
[SPEAKER_02]: He's being paid in love and high fives.

1991
02:40:03,687 --> 02:40:30,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I am being paid in involvement which has been it's legitimately wonderful to do we said Jason if you'll help us out we will give you what we get from doing this show we will match our salary I get an equal share of what we get that's what he gets okay back to the email has Jason introduced OLR to the Game Grumps web show

1992
02:40:31,061 --> 02:40:58,191
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard of it I know of Game Grumps I know I have name dropped it and similar channels that I follow once or twice and I'm pretty sure I've even worn a shirt out here and not that I of course have any I don't have any connection to any of these other shows except as a fan but I do have some ideas of things that I think could be kind of pretty fantastic but we'll see if I can actually get in touch with people and make things happen

1993
02:40:58,772 --> 02:41:15,270
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to rip anything off no promises to speak of but I consume a hell of a lot of content so many of these things take place in California anyway so it's a little bit more doable and not just something by Skype I have ideas

1994
02:41:15,450 --> 02:41:16,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.

1995
02:41:42,889 --> 02:41:44,550
[SPEAKER_12]: The Polaris Network, just in general.

1996
02:41:44,771 --> 02:41:49,754
[SPEAKER_12]: I drop in, see whatever videos catch my eye, and then move on to something else.

1997
02:41:51,015 --> 02:41:54,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Game Grumps, crap, what's his name?

1998
02:41:54,538 --> 02:41:56,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Gerard, JKCompletesIt.

1999
02:41:58,300 --> 02:42:23,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Markiplier, I've been watching quite a lot of his stuff lately and I feel like, oh, Continue Show does not a let's play, not a review but hey, let's play a game and publish a video of the memorial moments 30 minutes or so of a game updates every Wednesday they're in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and they're pretty fun to watch too

2000
02:42:24,342 --> 02:42:27,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the stuff I like are the review ones like Classic Game Room.

2001
02:42:27,944 --> 02:42:29,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really like Game Sack.

2002
02:42:29,445 --> 02:42:30,245
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a newer one.

2003
02:42:30,785 --> 02:42:31,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And Game Theory.

2004
02:42:31,906 --> 02:42:32,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch anything.

2005
02:42:33,067 --> 02:42:34,227
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't.

2006
02:42:34,347 --> 02:42:36,648
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually do not watch review things.

2007
02:42:36,748 --> 02:42:38,750
[SPEAKER_12]: I watch active content things.

2008
02:42:38,950 --> 02:42:47,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Every single person that I just named plays a game and either voiceover afterwards or running commentary while they're playing the game.

2009
02:42:47,934 --> 02:42:54,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to clarify, I support indie broadcasting and people doing it, but it's just like, I'm too busy.

2010
02:42:55,638 --> 02:43:00,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to watch the stuff my friends do, because a lot of my friends are doing live streaming, so I do a lot of that, and I'm too busy producing.

2011
02:43:01,422 --> 02:43:11,387
[SPEAKER_09]: But to be honest, I think of my favorites right now, I'd really have to go for Game Theory, because I like the fact that it breaks apart and analyzes it.

2012
02:43:11,647 --> 02:43:15,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Did just catch that the other day because... Is Link dead one?

2013
02:43:15,449 --> 02:43:19,232
[SPEAKER_12]: No, Mario's Affliction.

2014
02:43:19,252 --> 02:43:26,316
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember the name, but basically the fact that he's actually kind of the anti-hero in the legitimate lore and everything in the Mario universe.

2015
02:43:27,157 --> 02:43:30,859
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, to go ahead and close up this email, since that was the last thing.

2016
02:43:31,139 --> 02:43:31,539
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

2017
02:43:31,639 --> 02:43:32,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night at the Nasty Canasta.

2018
02:43:33,921 --> 02:43:35,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and here for Nasty Canasta...

2019
02:43:39,786 --> 02:43:43,669
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Konga from Beatmania 2DX4 style by Good Cool.

2020
02:43:44,049 --> 02:43:46,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you I have something better.

2021
02:43:46,872 --> 02:43:48,093
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's fun to play, too.

2022
02:43:48,193 --> 02:43:49,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Nasty Canasta.

2023
02:43:51,916 --> 02:43:52,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow.

2024
02:43:53,137 --> 02:43:54,798
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I'm not the only one that likes game theory.

2025
02:43:55,618 --> 02:44:00,482
[SPEAKER_14]: I tried it one time a while back to mix Konga and Konga Feeling together.

2026
02:44:00,582 --> 02:44:01,943
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't work.

2027
02:44:02,023 --> 02:44:02,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work.

2028
02:44:02,804 --> 02:44:03,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss your remixes, Loki.

2029
02:44:06,138 --> 02:44:06,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, is that it for emails?

2030
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:07,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2031
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:08,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well then there you go.

2032
02:44:08,941 --> 02:44:12,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Now he's busy with genetic mixes.

2033
02:44:14,627 --> 02:44:17,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send emails.

2034
02:44:17,630 --> 02:44:18,851
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fantastic.

2035
02:44:19,892 --> 02:44:25,217
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week because, you know, we're angsty some of the time.

2036
02:44:25,858 --> 02:44:26,498
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the time.

2037
02:44:27,479 --> 02:44:27,840
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.

2038
02:44:42,614 --> 02:44:49,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have to do a little bit of a story, and then I will say a big F you to this jerk face.

2039
02:44:49,876 --> 02:44:54,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to Target, and some people on my Facebook and Tumblr know about this.

2040
02:44:54,037 --> 02:45:01,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was going to Target, and there was this big guy just smoking in front of the door, blocking the path, and I was like, eh.

2041
02:45:01,560 --> 02:45:08,842
[SPEAKER_09]: So I tried to walk around him, and he kept putting himself in my way, so I just scooted on around because I'm shorter and faster, and he tried to grab my arm.

2042
02:45:09,915 --> 02:45:12,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Going into the target, and I mean, this guy's bigger than Dan.

2043
02:45:12,836 --> 02:45:13,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

2044
02:45:14,276 --> 02:45:16,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm about to go off, so finish your story.

2045
02:45:16,497 --> 02:45:19,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and he speaks in this whiskey voice, you know, the whiskey chain smoker voice.

2046
02:45:20,537 --> 02:45:30,000
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, so he tries to grab my arm, and I pull back, and I said, I meant to say Neanderthal, and I called him Neolithic, but I said, don't touch me, you Neolithic sack of shit.

2047
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:35,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was, by that point, angry, because someone trying to grab me

2048
02:45:36,403 --> 02:45:36,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he legal?

2049
02:45:37,744 --> 02:45:41,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Apart from that, it's something that sets me off immediately.

2050
02:45:41,728 --> 02:45:42,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does that?

2051
02:45:43,129 --> 02:45:44,451
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not high school.

2052
02:45:44,531 --> 02:45:45,352
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a bully.

2053
02:45:45,372 --> 02:45:46,312
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an adult.

2054
02:45:46,673 --> 02:45:50,356
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't grab somebody at random outside of Target.

2055
02:45:50,456 --> 02:45:57,163
[SPEAKER_09]: To quote my friend who I discussed this with, she's like, he's the type of person who thinks that women are property.

2056
02:45:59,208 --> 02:46:00,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It's disgusting.

2057
02:46:00,869 --> 02:46:09,572
[SPEAKER_09]: So just going into this, basically what happens is that by the time I got inside the building, after I said this to him, I just kept dashing back on into the building.

2058
02:46:09,832 --> 02:46:11,953
[SPEAKER_02]: He is going to get maced, and good.

2059
02:46:12,413 --> 02:46:15,555
[SPEAKER_02]: He is going to grab the wrong person, and he is going to be maced.

2060
02:46:15,595 --> 02:46:22,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm going to tell you, just knowing the way that I react to things, had he touched me, I probably would have completely lost my shit.

2061
02:46:23,378 --> 02:46:26,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Because without going into too much detail about my own past...

2062
02:46:27,219 --> 02:46:30,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I have lost my shit before when someone grabbed me.

2063
02:46:30,702 --> 02:46:31,703
[SPEAKER_09]: And it didn't end pretty.

2064
02:46:31,923 --> 02:46:32,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

2065
02:46:32,644 --> 02:46:33,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

2066
02:46:33,064 --> 02:46:34,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't loop the F-U.

2067
02:46:34,586 --> 02:46:35,046
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

2068
02:46:35,667 --> 02:46:37,689
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so... I was too busy being angry.

2069
02:46:37,749 --> 02:46:41,252
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm short enough and he's tall enough that if I had punched him, I would have punched him in the dick.

2070
02:46:41,332 --> 02:46:41,832
[SPEAKER_09]: So, anyway.

2071
02:46:42,653 --> 02:46:48,258
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I scooted inside Target and he's yelling after me, Come back here, midget!

2072
02:46:49,379 --> 02:46:50,220
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a midget, really?

2073
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:50,760
[SPEAKER_09]: For a record, I'm 5'3".

2074
02:46:52,341 --> 02:46:57,908
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's all he could say, and I was like, and it just, because I was so angry and so worked up.

2075
02:46:58,209 --> 02:46:59,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have called the police.

2076
02:46:59,731 --> 02:47:03,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, if I had been with you, I, oh, it would have gone down at the Target parking lot.

2077
02:47:05,051 --> 02:47:06,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's put it this way.

2078
02:47:06,552 --> 02:47:15,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so worked up and so angry and so fucking close to a full-blown meltdown that I let it out the only way I could think of, which was hysterical laughter.

2079
02:47:16,422 --> 02:47:20,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Just laughing my ass off, and this guy outside of here goes, Man, she's laughing at you!

2080
02:47:20,966 --> 02:47:22,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like, Come back here, Major, are you laughing at me?

2081
02:47:23,288 --> 02:47:30,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's almost better than the physical punching in the dick, because I publicly humiliated him, and that was pretty funny, too.

2082
02:47:31,275 --> 02:47:35,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, so, and thank you, Alan, I love you.

2083
02:47:35,218 --> 02:47:37,841
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, um, it's because DarkSakura had the gall to be a woman in public.

2084
02:47:40,134 --> 02:47:47,917
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, once I calmed down and had a fun conversation with the lady in the sock department and, you know, how she's like, yeah, I saw him out there.

2085
02:47:48,137 --> 02:47:50,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried to teach my son never to be like that.

2086
02:47:50,719 --> 02:47:52,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, bless you, you know.

2087
02:47:53,120 --> 02:47:57,642
[SPEAKER_09]: And they ended up escorting the guys off the property and I think they did call in the cops.

2088
02:47:57,662 --> 02:48:02,344
[SPEAKER_09]: But I stayed inside the Walmart, not Walmart, but Target for a solid hour.

2089
02:48:02,544 --> 02:48:05,705
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what was even worse about that is that the Hanukkah stuff wasn't on sale yet.

2090
02:48:08,067 --> 02:48:17,296
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, so I just ended up just wandering around and looking at stuff and looking at toys and playing on the internet on my phone and finally left.

2091
02:48:17,536 --> 02:48:24,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And though I have to say that leaving the place is like that sort of there's like a layer of calm that comes when you're in.

2092
02:48:24,623 --> 02:48:24,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, Loki.

2093
02:48:54,207 --> 02:48:55,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, I only have one.

2094
02:48:56,788 --> 02:48:59,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Lucky for the fact that I have to get my wisdom teeth out.

2095
02:49:00,669 --> 02:49:03,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Dammit, I thought I was determined to be wise!

2096
02:49:05,250 --> 02:49:12,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't really have a lot to F you, so F you to my snacking habit.

2097
02:49:12,713 --> 02:49:13,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out of control!

2098
02:49:14,534 --> 02:49:15,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you like your candy cane?

2099
02:49:15,676 --> 02:49:16,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

2100
02:49:16,116 --> 02:49:18,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate the whole damn thing.

2101
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:19,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a habit.

2102
02:49:19,421 --> 02:49:19,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I love food.

2103
02:49:20,842 --> 02:49:21,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason.

2104
02:49:22,384 --> 02:49:24,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one sometime this week, but I had a really good week.

2105
02:49:24,968 --> 02:49:25,749
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not angsty.

2106
02:49:25,829 --> 02:49:26,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.

2107
02:49:27,231 --> 02:49:28,993
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to Jason for not having angst.

2108
02:49:29,794 --> 02:49:30,094
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2109
02:49:31,454 --> 02:49:32,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to catch my breath.

2110
02:49:33,255 --> 02:49:40,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2111
02:49:40,156 --> 02:49:41,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to run through these quick.

2112
02:49:41,396 --> 02:49:41,796
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2113
02:49:41,916 --> 02:49:52,399
[SPEAKER_14]: So Atari, maybe coming back, they have finally received court approval to come out of bankruptcy.

2114
02:49:53,179 --> 02:49:59,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess they have a payment plan now that involves paying back $3.8 million owed to the bankruptcy lender.

2115
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:10,346
[SPEAKER_14]: And once they have that and they're operating on their own, they can start paying, I guess, $1.75 million to different creditors over the course of three years.

2116
02:50:11,226 --> 02:50:16,249
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently that's a small portion of the over $10 million that they're owned.

2117
02:50:17,990 --> 02:50:22,792
[SPEAKER_14]: But hey, that'd be good because at least it's not another studio going under.

2118
02:50:25,053 --> 02:50:26,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they'll make another Alone in the Dark game.

2119
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:31,140
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2120
02:50:31,881 --> 02:50:32,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good luck to Atari.

2121
02:50:33,181 --> 02:50:33,482
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2122
02:50:34,022 --> 02:50:35,162
[SPEAKER_02]: One other story for you guys.

2123
02:50:35,182 --> 02:50:37,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I promised, we would do a story about pornography.

2124
02:50:38,244 --> 02:50:43,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a story from a website that really needs to consider their ad model because it's just annoying.

2125
02:50:43,827 --> 02:50:46,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why people get ad blockers, Destructoid.

2126
02:50:46,449 --> 02:50:54,813
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, Destructoid ran this story about what Pornhub had to say about pornography on the various consoles that are out there.

2127
02:50:55,393 --> 02:51:00,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And Destructoid actually called Pornhub or emailed or whatever people do to talk to each other.

2128
02:51:01,838 --> 02:51:18,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Pornhub is targeting consoles for website support because that is where some of our users today prefer to access our site and our aim is to offer a great user experience across all platforms.

2129
02:51:19,497 --> 02:51:20,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the stuff you really want to know.

2130
02:51:21,460 --> 02:51:23,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are people watching their pornography?

2131
02:51:23,303 --> 02:51:30,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, the PS3, the PS4, the Wii, the 360, they all can have the internet and therefore you can get porn on it.

2132
02:51:31,955 --> 02:51:34,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a Nintendo console, the Wii, can get porn.

2133
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:57,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, so the majority of porn, Pornhub traffic comes from the PlayStation 3 55% of pornography comes from the PlayStation 3 The Xbox 360 accounts for 39% And the Wii, as this website calls it, a limp 6% That's just because, have you tried internet on the Wii?

2134
02:51:57,379 --> 02:51:59,001
[SPEAKER_14]: It's awful So true

2135
02:51:59,796 --> 02:52:01,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And technically, though, it does work, though.

2136
02:52:02,778 --> 02:52:03,038
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

2137
02:52:03,318 --> 02:52:05,560
[SPEAKER_14]: The internet on the way to bring up porn.

2138
02:52:05,800 --> 02:52:06,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

2139
02:52:06,480 --> 02:52:06,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

2140
02:52:07,161 --> 02:52:07,701
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that.

2141
02:52:08,101 --> 02:52:08,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2142
02:52:08,782 --> 02:52:10,743
[SPEAKER_02]: It was research purposes, of course.

2143
02:52:11,644 --> 02:52:13,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so congratulations, PlayStation 3.

2144
02:52:13,785 --> 02:52:15,806
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the kings and queens of pornography.

2145
02:52:16,327 --> 02:52:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

2146
02:52:17,807 --> 02:52:21,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2147
02:52:21,190 --> 02:52:23,911

02:52:26,793 --> 02:52:28,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it's following you.

2151
02:52:53,956 --> 02:52:55,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is following me.

2152
02:52:55,537 --> 02:52:57,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It will follow you around the room.

2153
02:52:57,277 --> 02:53:00,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It will basically like if you walk out of view, it's going to be like confused.

2154
02:53:00,558 --> 02:53:01,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, where did he go?

2155
02:53:01,598 --> 02:53:02,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God, it's Hal.

2156
02:53:02,339 --> 02:53:02,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It's over here.

2157
02:53:02,959 --> 02:53:04,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Clean that mess up off your table.

2158
02:53:04,639 --> 02:53:05,840
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to zoom in on my face.

2159
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:06,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2160
02:53:06,840 --> 02:53:07,400
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

2161
02:53:09,381 --> 02:53:10,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me some wheat thins, bro.

2162
02:53:13,742 --> 02:53:15,183
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot have my wheat thins.

2163
02:53:16,598 --> 02:53:16,918
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2164
02:53:17,539 --> 02:53:19,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, congratulations, YYR.

2165
02:53:19,380 --> 02:53:24,063
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the first Xbox One caller to the show.

2166
02:53:24,583 --> 02:53:26,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So can I troll you?

2167
02:53:26,284 --> 02:53:29,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'm sorry you have to see my messy living room.

2168
02:53:29,586 --> 02:53:33,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually thinking about cleaning it up for this call, but then I said fuck it.

2169
02:53:34,349 --> 02:53:34,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait.

2170
02:53:34,650 --> 02:53:36,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I try something real quick, YYR?

2171
02:53:36,171 --> 02:53:36,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I try something real quick?

2172
02:53:37,311 --> 02:53:37,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, hold on.

2173
02:53:38,532 --> 02:53:38,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox.

2174
02:53:38,892 --> 02:53:39,273
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

2175
02:53:39,713 --> 02:53:40,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Power down.

2176
02:53:41,634 --> 02:53:42,014
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

2177
02:53:42,675 --> 02:53:43,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that.

2178
02:53:43,495 --> 02:53:45,156
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, it's not power down.

2179
02:53:45,717 --> 02:53:46,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

2180
02:53:46,820 --> 02:53:47,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn off now.

2181
02:53:47,861 --> 02:53:48,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox, turn off.

2182
02:53:50,223 --> 02:53:51,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't listen to Rob, Xbox.

2183
02:53:52,564 --> 02:53:54,106
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll deceive you every time.

2184
02:53:54,226 --> 02:53:55,307
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll lead you astray.

2185
02:53:56,147 --> 02:53:56,447
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2186
02:53:56,528 --> 02:53:57,368
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's interesting.

2187
02:53:57,588 --> 02:54:10,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have a feeling that it somehow can differentiate between voices in the room and voices from the speaker because my girlfriend already tried this and it didn't work out all that well.

2188
02:54:10,659 --> 02:54:11,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't work out.

2189
02:54:11,499 --> 02:54:15,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're making Xbox One video calls to your girlfriend, huh?

2190
02:54:16,247 --> 02:54:25,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, actually, what's interesting, I was cleaning up my place for the last two days and listening to the last two weeks worth of OLR, and I see you mention that you're in San Francisco a lot.

2191
02:54:25,933 --> 02:54:26,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess where she lives?

2192
02:54:27,594 --> 02:54:28,515
[SPEAKER_02]: San Francisco.

2193
02:54:29,155 --> 02:54:36,039
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we may, depending on what happens, we may need to make some plans to, you know, meet, chill out, because she's actually listening right now.

2194
02:54:36,539 --> 02:54:37,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So, she'll know who you are.

2195
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:39,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, howdy!

2196
02:54:39,681 --> 02:54:41,562
[SPEAKER_02]: When are you coming to San Francisco?

2197
02:54:41,582 --> 02:54:45,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Because our buddy Jason is in San Francisco for the holidays, so...

2198
02:54:46,357 --> 02:54:54,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I mean, I'm going to visit her for a few days on the 19th, but I'm not sticking around for very long, because I basically used up all of my vacation this year.

2199
02:54:56,002 --> 02:55:02,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look up VXChaseNXV, because he's in, I almost said Seattle, what the hell, he's in San Francisco right now.

2200
02:55:02,386 --> 02:55:04,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in touch anyways, let's see if we can work something out.

2201
02:55:04,487 --> 02:55:04,927
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

2202
02:55:05,828 --> 02:55:06,288
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

2203
02:55:06,815 --> 02:55:11,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm listening to OLR over the weekend, and by the way, how's the audio?

2204
02:55:11,279 --> 02:55:12,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it coming through okay?

2205
02:55:12,520 --> 02:55:13,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.

2206
02:55:13,501 --> 02:55:21,247
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell that your microphone, like you're not talking into a microphone, that it's like a room microphone that has a big gain, but it's fine.

2207
02:55:21,688 --> 02:55:22,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good enough.

2208
02:55:22,188 --> 02:55:24,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I shouldn't try plugging this in?

2209
02:55:24,911 --> 02:55:27,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be curious just to see what the quality difference is.

2210
02:55:28,211 --> 02:55:29,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, you know what?

2211
02:55:29,052 --> 02:55:31,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll plug in my little mic here.

2212
02:55:31,175 --> 02:55:32,476
[SPEAKER_02]: He's plugging in a little mic.

2213
02:55:32,556 --> 02:55:34,298
[SPEAKER_02]: This is still a radio show.

2214
02:55:34,338 --> 02:55:37,102
[SPEAKER_02]: We might all be looking at video, but I know the podcast listeners can't see it.

2215
02:55:37,402 --> 02:55:38,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, can you hear me now?

2216
02:55:38,944 --> 02:55:41,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that sounds like a normal call now.

2217
02:55:41,467 --> 02:55:43,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I think I lost you.

2218
02:55:43,309 --> 02:55:43,790
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're here.

2219
02:55:43,810 --> 02:55:43,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

2220
02:55:43,870 --> 02:55:44,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still there?

2221
02:55:44,851 --> 02:55:46,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and you sound great, so talk.

2222
02:55:46,834 --> 02:55:47,434
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.

2223
02:55:48,315 --> 02:55:50,156
[SPEAKER_12]: And this became a one-way conversation.

2224
02:55:50,396 --> 02:55:51,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, yeah.

2225
02:55:51,376 --> 02:55:54,918
[SPEAKER_12]: That's too bad, because he sounds better on that thing.

2226
02:55:55,058 --> 02:56:00,921
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to suppress the urge to reach out my hand and say, turn the volume up in sign language, but we don't have a cam in here.

2227
02:56:00,941 --> 02:56:01,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, we don't have a cam in here.

2228
02:56:02,101 --> 02:56:03,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I need to go get one.

2229
02:56:03,742 --> 02:56:09,784
[SPEAKER_02]: He's pressing buttons, and I see the lights in his room fluctuating like he's running through different screens.

2230
02:56:10,184 --> 02:56:11,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well I just unplugged it.

2231
02:56:11,445 --> 02:56:12,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me now?

2232
02:56:12,485 --> 02:56:14,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we could actually hear you before, and you sounded great.

2233
02:56:14,606 --> 02:56:14,866
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

2234
02:56:15,027 --> 02:56:15,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2235
02:56:15,527 --> 02:56:15,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

2236
02:56:16,227 --> 02:56:17,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he can't hear us at all.

2237
02:56:17,688 --> 02:56:18,568
[SPEAKER_12]: You lost it entirely.

2238
02:56:19,349 --> 02:56:19,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

2239
02:56:20,249 --> 02:56:20,990
[SPEAKER_12]: This is exciting.

2240
02:56:23,951 --> 02:56:24,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, he hung up.

2241
02:56:27,954 --> 02:56:28,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox One, y'all.

2242
02:56:29,034 --> 02:56:29,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Wave of the future.

2243
02:56:31,376 --> 02:56:31,956
[SPEAKER_02]: He's calling back.

2244
02:56:32,636 --> 02:56:33,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, he's calling back right now.

2245
02:56:37,699 --> 02:56:40,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would have to say that was absolutely a success.

2246
02:56:40,441 --> 02:56:40,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2247
02:56:41,809 --> 02:56:43,769
[SPEAKER_02]: We could hear you fine that whole time.

2248
02:56:44,250 --> 02:56:44,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you know.

2249
02:56:44,990 --> 02:56:45,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

2250
02:56:45,550 --> 02:56:45,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2251
02:56:47,110 --> 02:56:50,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I absolutely stopped hearing you.

2252
02:56:50,551 --> 02:56:53,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried unplugging the mic and I still couldn't hear you.

2253
02:56:53,692 --> 02:56:55,192
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah.

2254
02:56:55,472 --> 02:56:58,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Just $4.99 at your local Walmart or Target.

2255
02:56:58,853 --> 02:57:01,073
[SPEAKER_05]: $499 US dollars.

2256
02:57:02,193 --> 02:57:02,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2257
02:57:03,054 --> 02:57:03,834
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is on your mind?

2258
02:57:03,854 --> 02:57:05,334
[SPEAKER_02]: You send an email to the show, right?

2259
02:57:06,034 --> 02:57:09,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, basically after listening I'm listening to six podcasts

2260
02:57:10,111 --> 02:57:11,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven hours worth of OLR.

2261
02:57:11,812 --> 02:57:16,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course there were a few times when I'm just like, I wish I was in chat so I could respond to things.

2262
02:57:16,876 --> 02:57:19,978
[SPEAKER_05]: But there were three things in particular that I wanted to bring up.

2263
02:57:21,759 --> 02:57:28,783
[SPEAKER_05]: The subject of the discontinuation of spot pass service for Swapnote was brought up at least four separate times.

2264
02:57:29,824 --> 02:57:33,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to throw in my two cents on that.

2265
02:57:33,487 --> 02:57:35,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at first I thought also, why...

2266
02:57:35,953 --> 02:57:36,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did they do that?

2267
02:57:36,713 --> 02:57:40,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Why couldn't they just drop the photo feature and leave the rest of it intact?

2268
02:57:40,996 --> 02:57:57,705
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought about it for a while and then I understood this had to be done because Swapnote unfortunately put kids and teens in touch with people who could, you know, take their pictures and do bad things with them.

2269
02:57:58,726 --> 02:58:04,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they had just dropped the photo feature, it would have left these kids and teens

2270
02:58:05,307 --> 02:58:09,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Or more direct something like, hey, meet me at this park near your house.

2271
02:58:09,689 --> 02:58:10,849
[SPEAKER_05]: That, you know, kills that idea.

2272
02:58:10,869 --> 02:58:11,229
[SPEAKER_05]: It stops it.

2273
02:58:25,940 --> 02:58:33,029
[SPEAKER_02]: My biggest problem though, YYR, is that how come the kids are talking to these people unsupervised in the first place?

2274
02:58:33,249 --> 02:58:38,917
[SPEAKER_02]: If a parent is concerned about it, why is Swapnote even being downloaded in the first place?

2275
02:58:38,957 --> 02:58:40,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if the parents were more involved...

2276
02:58:41,219 --> 02:59:02,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you wouldn't have this happen And this isn't something that's... I mean, this is horrible And we do need to stop predators from predating on children But disabling Swapnote is not going to do that Because there's always email There's always the internet and other forms They found each other somehow So I just kind of feel like, you know, well, why...

2277
02:59:04,125 --> 02:59:04,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand.

2278
02:59:04,705 --> 02:59:07,726
[SPEAKER_05]: You're absolutely preaching to the choir.

2279
02:59:07,866 --> 02:59:13,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely agree with you that parents need to be more hands-on about what their kids and teens are doing.

2280
02:59:13,369 --> 02:59:20,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the moments that they're not, Nintendo being as family-friendly as they want to be, that is what they chose to do.

2281
02:59:20,631 --> 02:59:22,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand it.

2282
02:59:22,692 --> 02:59:23,252
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.

2283
02:59:23,752 --> 02:59:30,715
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can understand that decision because they needed to cut off the contact between these two parties.

2284
02:59:32,530 --> 02:59:40,436
[SPEAKER_02]: It just also further goes to show why we're never going to have video play on the virtual console, and I just think that's the wrong direction for Nintendo in general.

2285
02:59:40,476 --> 02:59:41,937
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks for the rest of us.

2286
02:59:42,097 --> 02:59:43,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.

2287
02:59:44,279 --> 02:59:45,019
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

2288
02:59:45,139 --> 02:59:49,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that just comes with the territory of gaming on a Nintendo platform.

2289
02:59:50,123 --> 02:59:52,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to have to do those things on other platforms.

2290
02:59:53,971 --> 03:00:02,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think Nintendo's other thing too is that just because a parent should do something, they know not all parents will do something, so it keeps their reputation safe.

2291
03:00:03,554 --> 03:00:05,115
[SPEAKER_09]: They have their brand to look after.

2292
03:00:05,355 --> 03:00:06,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, exactly.

2293
03:00:07,996 --> 03:00:12,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway, the second thing I wanted to bring up was Forza 5 microtransactions.

2294
03:00:13,097 --> 03:00:20,200
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it seems like you guys don't think it's a really big deal, but I'm going to give you three reasons why folks are up in arms about it.

2295
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:23,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, in older Forza games...

2296
03:00:24,141 --> 03:00:29,925
[SPEAKER_05]: By playing through the game and completing the challenges or whatever, occasionally you would get cars for free.

2297
03:00:30,125 --> 03:00:32,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you cleared this thing, you get this car.

2298
03:00:32,807 --> 03:00:35,029
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't do that anymore in 5.

2299
03:00:35,489 --> 03:00:41,874
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot earn cars by any means except buying them with credits or tokens.

2300
03:00:42,374 --> 03:00:46,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for the very first car you get when you start the game, because how can you drive without one?

2301
03:00:46,593 --> 03:01:16,322
[SPEAKER_05]: so it's not like what we were just saying about Gran Turismo 6 where you just unlock them through the course of the story I had the impression that these two games were in very similar boats you have to buy all of the cars now at least that's what I've read online I just started playing the game myself I haven't really gotten to a point where I would want to buy another car yet but from what I've been reading in Amazon reviews and GameFAQs posts and other places there are no free cars anymore except the one you get at the start you have to buy everything now

2302
03:01:17,011 --> 03:01:18,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready for your mind to be blown?

2303
03:01:18,492 --> 03:01:18,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

2304
03:01:19,452 --> 03:01:21,313
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how DLC cars work.

2305
03:01:21,373 --> 03:01:22,493
[SPEAKER_05]: This is item number two.

2306
03:01:23,754 --> 03:01:25,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You pay real money for the DLC, yes?

2307
03:01:26,495 --> 03:01:26,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

2308
03:01:28,216 --> 03:01:36,779
[SPEAKER_05]: When you do this, this adds the cars to the game, but you cannot actually drive the cars until you buy them from the in-game shop.

2309
03:01:38,360 --> 03:01:38,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh.

2310
03:01:39,460 --> 03:01:46,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't have enough credits to do that, you get to open your wallet again and essentially pay twice to use these cars.

2311
03:01:47,261 --> 03:01:47,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh huh.

2312
03:01:48,746 --> 03:01:48,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yup.

2313
03:01:50,245 --> 03:01:54,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really hoping somebody in the chatroom here is going to jump in and say you're wrong.

2314
03:01:54,688 --> 03:01:57,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, no offense, but I just... I would hope so, too.

2315
03:01:57,370 --> 03:01:58,090
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

2316
03:01:58,651 --> 03:01:59,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope someone tells me that.

2317
03:02:00,392 --> 03:02:07,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf went to bed, and I know he's been playing the game, so... He said the exact same thing, though, on his show, I want to say, yeah.

2318
03:02:08,277 --> 03:02:10,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, here's the thing.

2319
03:02:10,759 --> 03:02:16,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three item, which basically makes one and two worse, is credits are earned slower in the game than they were in Forza 4, so...

2320
03:02:17,865 --> 03:02:22,348
[SPEAKER_02]: DKBeast in chat at live.vognetwork.com says he's not wrong

2321
03:02:48,424 --> 03:02:51,026
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the most expensive cars early on.

2322
03:02:51,506 --> 03:02:53,527
[SPEAKER_05]: They give you a free other car.

2323
03:02:53,907 --> 03:02:55,788
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, they give you that car for free.

2324
03:02:55,828 --> 03:03:01,411
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to get in on this, you had to buy the game at launch and join their Forza Rewards program or whatever.

2325
03:03:01,471 --> 03:03:02,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what that is.

2326
03:03:02,511 --> 03:03:02,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2327
03:03:04,032 --> 03:03:05,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a mess.

2328
03:03:05,613 --> 03:03:11,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really don't like this whole, you bought a $60 game, now we'll throw free-to-play type elements into it.

2329
03:03:12,268 --> 03:03:14,610
[SPEAKER_05]: is something I hope doesn't last too long.

2330
03:03:14,970 --> 03:03:16,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope so.

2331
03:03:16,131 --> 03:03:17,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope people reject that.

2332
03:03:18,012 --> 03:03:19,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you said you had one more thing?

2333
03:03:20,054 --> 03:03:26,338
[SPEAKER_05]: The last point I wanted to make, on the subject of Loki being too harsh towards the new consoles, no, I don't agree.

2334
03:03:26,498 --> 03:03:28,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think he was overly harsh at all.

2335
03:03:28,480 --> 03:03:31,662
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact of the matter is, the games aren't there yet.

2336
03:03:31,922 --> 03:03:41,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I bought an X1 because I want to be one of the first developers who didn't get into the early program to put games on the system.

2337
03:03:42,175 --> 03:03:44,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't buy it because I had to have it.

2338
03:03:44,857 --> 03:03:49,360
[SPEAKER_05]: The game I've most been looking forward to playing is Peggle 2, and that comes out tomorrow.

2339
03:03:50,821 --> 03:03:51,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Good choice.

2340
03:03:52,282 --> 03:03:55,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I got Forza 5, I got Dead Rising 3, they've mostly been sitting there.

2341
03:03:56,345 --> 03:04:03,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, you know, the Skype thing is cool, the TV features are neat, but I don't use most of them, I just, you know...

2342
03:04:04,474 --> 03:04:13,798
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool to be able to say, okay, watch CNN or watch Comedy Central or whatever, and the Xbox One will push the buttons on your cable box for you.

2343
03:04:14,658 --> 03:04:17,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this call coming from an Xbox One.

2344
03:04:18,459 --> 03:04:19,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cute.

2345
03:04:19,560 --> 03:04:22,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice, but it's not a have-to-have kind of thing.

2346
03:04:22,721 --> 03:04:26,383
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no real reason, in my opinion, to own one of these boxes right now.

2347
03:04:26,483 --> 03:04:26,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2348
03:04:26,923 --> 03:04:28,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no real reason to own a PS4.

2349
03:04:30,064 --> 03:04:30,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

2350
03:04:30,824 --> 03:04:31,805
[SPEAKER_05]: The games aren't there yet.

2351
03:04:32,205 --> 03:04:32,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

2352
03:04:33,837 --> 03:04:35,518
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR, this has been a fantastic call.

2353
03:04:35,618 --> 03:04:36,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this.

2354
03:04:36,159 --> 03:04:37,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls.

2355
03:04:39,460 --> 03:04:40,701
[SPEAKER_05]: One quick thing.

2356
03:04:41,181 --> 03:04:41,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Really quick.

2357
03:04:42,322 --> 03:04:51,247
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing from Past OLR, Jamie pointed out that our society, our government, and our healthcare systems don't give enough attention to mental health.

2358
03:04:51,887 --> 03:04:53,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably the truest statement that ever was.

2359
03:04:54,309 --> 03:04:56,470
[SPEAKER_05]: This needs to be dealt with.

2360
03:04:56,570 --> 03:04:57,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be looked into.

2361
03:04:57,751 --> 03:04:59,491
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be focused on.

2362
03:04:59,572 --> 03:05:00,432
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important.

2363
03:05:01,070 --> 03:05:01,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.

2364
03:05:01,791 --> 03:05:03,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2365
03:05:03,454 --> 03:05:07,781
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR, thank you so much for binge listening to OLR and then calling us from your Xbox One.

2366
03:05:07,821 --> 03:05:10,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

2367
03:05:10,065 --> 03:05:11,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much is never enough.

2368
03:05:11,688 --> 03:05:12,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, buddy.

2369
03:05:13,110 --> 03:05:13,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

2370
03:05:13,591 --> 03:05:13,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2371
03:05:14,690 --> 03:05:19,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a pleasure to hear from him, and that was a lot of fun to go to the Xbox One for the calls, but whoa!

2372
03:05:20,414 --> 03:05:21,734
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck was that?

2373
03:05:21,754 --> 03:05:23,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we dialing into AOL?

2374
03:05:23,155 --> 03:05:24,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we connected to a BBS?

2375
03:05:24,716 --> 03:05:26,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we just call a fax machine?

2376
03:05:26,137 --> 03:05:28,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a fax machine that was calling us?

2377
03:05:28,178 --> 03:05:30,560
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, Rob, you know what's actually super funny?

2378
03:05:31,641 --> 03:05:35,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Tiara just beat Mass Effect 2, and she romanced Garrus.

2379
03:05:35,623 --> 03:05:42,830
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2380
03:05:42,850 --> 03:05:44,351
[SPEAKER_02]: But the phone is still ringing off the hook.

2381
03:05:44,392 --> 03:05:45,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to it.

2382
03:05:45,392 --> 03:05:46,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2383
03:05:46,313 --> 03:05:46,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2384
03:05:48,235 --> 03:05:50,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to fix my... Can you hear me?

2385
03:05:50,217 --> 03:05:50,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can hear you.

2386
03:05:50,958 --> 03:05:51,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

2387
03:05:51,839 --> 03:05:52,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to fix my headphones.

2388
03:05:52,940 --> 03:05:55,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I just wanted to call real quickly about Danny Wells.

2389
03:05:56,103 --> 03:05:57,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is Kai Judo, right?

2390
03:05:57,925 --> 03:05:58,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Kai Judo.

2391
03:05:58,545 --> 03:05:58,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, buddy.

2392
03:05:58,886 --> 03:05:59,226
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

2393
03:06:00,236 --> 03:06:00,497
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2394
03:06:01,418 --> 03:06:04,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what I just wanted to mention was I didn't know him as Mario.

2395
03:06:04,724 --> 03:06:06,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew him as the bartender on the Jeffersons.

2396
03:06:07,368 --> 03:06:09,372
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where he's mostly known for me.

2397
03:06:09,652 --> 03:06:10,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

2398
03:06:10,453 --> 03:06:11,195
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2399
03:06:11,255 --> 03:06:12,237
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, wasn't he?

2400
03:06:12,984 --> 03:06:14,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he was Charlie on the Jeffersons for years.

2401
03:06:14,985 --> 03:06:18,646
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really where his notoriety comes from, you know?

2402
03:06:18,746 --> 03:06:21,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So many talented people on that show are deceased, you know?

2403
03:06:22,228 --> 03:06:24,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is anybody from that show?

2404
03:06:24,349 --> 03:06:26,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know we lost Sherman Helmsley.

2405
03:06:26,870 --> 03:06:28,851
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost Roxy Roker a long time ago.

2406
03:06:28,911 --> 03:06:31,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many people from that show that aren't around anymore.

2407
03:06:31,332 --> 03:06:33,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Bentley might still be alive.

2408
03:06:33,793 --> 03:06:35,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Florence is still alive, too.

2409
03:06:35,674 --> 03:06:36,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, Florence is alive.

2410
03:06:37,254 --> 03:06:38,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Bentley's alive, too.

2411
03:06:39,916 --> 03:06:40,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure.

2412
03:06:41,016 --> 03:06:42,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's where I knew him from.

2413
03:06:42,417 --> 03:06:44,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was looking him up on IMDB.

2414
03:06:44,719 --> 03:06:47,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know that this is another video game related thing.

2415
03:06:47,342 --> 03:06:50,624
[SPEAKER_03]: He did some voice acting for one of the Spooner Cell games.

2416
03:06:51,585 --> 03:06:52,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's been connected with video games.

2417
03:06:53,547 --> 03:06:54,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.

2418
03:06:55,208 --> 03:06:59,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like that you're recognizing him for things that aren't just Luigi.

2419
03:06:59,392 --> 03:07:02,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously our community remembers him for that an awful lot.

2420
03:07:02,334 --> 03:07:03,655
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's great.

2421
03:07:03,696 --> 03:07:05,998
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some awesome little like trivia type stuff.

2422
03:07:06,018 --> 03:07:06,378
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

2423
03:07:07,185 --> 03:07:07,485
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jeffersons

2424
03:07:26,627 --> 03:07:27,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're moving on.

2425
03:07:28,148 --> 03:07:29,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Freaking love that show.

2426
03:07:29,328 --> 03:07:30,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that show was great.

2427
03:07:30,529 --> 03:07:32,830
[SPEAKER_02]: A spinoff of All in the Family.

2428
03:07:33,170 --> 03:07:34,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Never realized that until years later.

2429
03:07:34,530 --> 03:07:39,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we could talk about TV for hours, but All in the Family had so many freaking spinoffs.

2430
03:07:41,473 --> 03:07:45,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You can even count Good Times as a spinoff from All in the Family.

2431
03:07:45,575 --> 03:07:46,015
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

2432
03:07:46,035 --> 03:07:49,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the mother came from Maud, which was a spinoff of...

2433
03:07:51,017 --> 03:07:52,219
[SPEAKER_03]: All in the Family.

2434
03:07:52,739 --> 03:07:58,686
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to write all this down for DarkSakura's future I'm a Nerd in 30 show.

2435
03:08:00,688 --> 03:08:04,052
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have an episode all about connections to All in the Family.

2436
03:08:06,614 --> 03:08:07,315
[SPEAKER_03]: One last thing.

2437
03:08:08,156 --> 03:08:09,097
[SPEAKER_03]: When you guys mentioned the

2438
03:08:10,058 --> 03:08:36,231
[SPEAKER_03]: the game show that let you run around and like pick video games um I thought at first I thought you met this other game show that I love called um it was like uh it was a takeoff of the newlywed game it was called I'm Telling where it had like a brother and sister I remember that show that show was great yes that was yeah that show was great and they had a similar thing where they would let you run through a maze and like you hit like this little uh siren thing to try to match what your brother or sister picked and you would get all the prizes that was just cool

2439
03:08:36,591 --> 03:08:37,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I so remember that.

2440
03:08:37,732 --> 03:08:43,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, because I was virtually, I mean, I do have a brother and a sister, but they're 14 and 16 years older than me.

2441
03:08:43,715 --> 03:08:46,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was kind of like an only child growing up.

2442
03:08:46,196 --> 03:08:51,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always was like, I want to, I want somebody to go on this show with, but you know, it was never going to happen.

2443
03:08:51,899 --> 03:08:52,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2444
03:08:52,160 --> 03:08:53,400
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have did a friend's edition.

2445
03:08:53,580 --> 03:08:54,701
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been, that would have worked.

2446
03:08:54,961 --> 03:08:55,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2447
03:08:55,541 --> 03:08:56,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

2448
03:08:56,202 --> 03:08:56,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got for you.

2449
03:08:57,102 --> 03:08:58,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Kai Judo, thanks for the walk down memory lane.

2450
03:08:58,903 --> 03:08:59,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

2451
03:08:59,403 --> 03:08:59,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

2452
03:09:00,744 --> 03:09:01,264
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

2453
03:09:01,304 --> 03:09:01,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2454
03:09:02,085 --> 03:09:04,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Great tribute to Danny Wells.

2455
03:09:04,145 --> 03:09:05,626
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the other things Danny Wells did?

2456
03:09:05,686 --> 03:09:06,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were great.

2457
03:09:06,546 --> 03:09:06,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.

2458
03:09:07,306 --> 03:09:12,028
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, DarkSakura, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2459
03:09:12,328 --> 03:09:19,770
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, DarkSakura, if you were to do a show like that, like the nerd stuff and I'm 30 or whatever, I could sing the theme song for you.

2460
03:09:20,330 --> 03:09:22,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the days.

2461
03:09:23,691 --> 03:09:24,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Answer the phone.

2462
03:09:28,018 --> 03:09:28,859
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't like my singing.

2463
03:09:28,879 --> 03:09:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Oh, hi.

2464
03:09:31,160 --> 03:09:32,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2465
03:09:32,721 --> 03:09:33,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2466
03:09:33,621 --> 03:09:35,723
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one and only Ranma calling from Brooklyn.

2467
03:09:36,163 --> 03:09:36,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Ranma.

2468
03:09:37,003 --> 03:09:38,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're on webcam, too.

2469
03:09:38,144 --> 03:09:39,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you calling us from your Xbox One?

2470
03:09:40,986 --> 03:09:43,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm calling from pre-Xbox One.

2471
03:09:43,607 --> 03:09:48,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called having Skype next to your Xbox 360 and chatting that way because it's a lot more fun.

2472
03:09:48,910 --> 03:09:52,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can shit talk that way while having Microsoft kind of breathing down your throat.

2473
03:09:52,312 --> 03:09:54,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're calling us from an Xbox Vision camera.

2474
03:09:55,314 --> 03:09:57,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, I'm calling from my awesome Logitech camera.

2475
03:09:57,735 --> 03:09:58,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2476
03:09:59,115 --> 03:10:03,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I noticed you got your Luigi hat on and you got your Luigi coffee cup.

2477
03:10:03,257 --> 03:10:04,377
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a Luigi coffee cup?

2478
03:10:04,397 --> 03:10:04,957
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

2479
03:10:05,077 --> 03:10:06,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got it from Nintendo World.

2480
03:10:06,418 --> 03:10:09,539
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have a Happy Holidays Christmas mug as well.

2481
03:10:10,019 --> 03:10:10,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2482
03:10:10,559 --> 03:10:12,199
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in your Luigi shirt.

2483
03:10:12,299 --> 03:10:13,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a Luigi shirt.

2484
03:10:13,900 --> 03:10:14,400
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that say?

2485
03:10:14,460 --> 03:10:15,721
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mirror imaged for me.

2486
03:10:15,761 --> 03:10:19,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the L. The L does not stand for loser.

2487
03:10:20,222 --> 03:10:23,363
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are in full black Luigi mode tonight.

2488
03:10:23,891 --> 03:10:25,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something like that.

2489
03:10:25,393 --> 03:10:29,117
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine does a webcomic called Sucks to be Ouija and it's pretty funny.

2490
03:10:29,498 --> 03:10:32,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And somewhere around here I have a... Oh, here it is.

2491
03:10:32,902 --> 03:10:36,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I also picked this up from my soon-to-be tree.

2492
03:10:38,328 --> 03:10:41,212
[SPEAKER_02]: A Ouija ornament that says Happy Holidays.

2493
03:10:41,732 --> 03:10:42,874
[SPEAKER_02]: That's adorable.

2494
03:10:43,908 --> 03:10:45,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I got some stuff we got to talk about.

2495
03:10:45,669 --> 03:10:47,510
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Rob, get the coffee on.

2496
03:10:47,530 --> 03:10:48,371
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some talking to do.

2497
03:10:48,511 --> 03:10:48,951
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2498
03:10:49,451 --> 03:10:50,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get out the cheesecake.

2499
03:10:51,532 --> 03:10:52,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fabulous, fabulous.

2500
03:10:53,834 --> 03:10:55,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about that one time in St.

2501
03:10:55,435 --> 03:10:55,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Olaf.

2502
03:11:00,418 --> 03:11:01,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you are something else.

2503
03:11:01,979 --> 03:11:02,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2504
03:11:02,579 --> 03:11:03,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that a lot.

2505
03:11:03,439 --> 03:11:03,780
[SPEAKER_02]: No, really.

2506
03:11:03,800 --> 03:11:04,100
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

2507
03:11:05,174 --> 03:11:15,837
[SPEAKER_04]: So, to back what Kaijito said, that's where I knew Danny Wells from because when the show first came on, I spotted Luigi before I noticed Mario was done by Captain Lou Albano, okay?

2508
03:11:17,217 --> 03:11:21,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that whole thing kind of comes full circle to me.

2509
03:11:21,599 --> 03:11:21,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2510
03:11:23,559 --> 03:11:26,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'd like to say, fuck yes to Square One TV.

2511
03:11:26,681 --> 03:11:30,164
[SPEAKER_04]: That show got me to run home to watch it, okay?

2512
03:11:30,284 --> 03:11:30,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.

2513
03:11:31,625 --> 03:11:36,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Got out of school at 3.10, I was there watching Thundercats at 3.30, Square One TV at 4.

2514
03:11:38,110 --> 03:11:41,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Square One was on for us at like 3.

2515
03:11:41,273 --> 03:11:44,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to get home fast if I wanted to see it, because elementary school you get out a little earlier.

2516
03:11:45,036 --> 03:11:48,759
[SPEAKER_12]: PBS affiliates don't have a set schedule, it differs from every single market.

2517
03:11:48,799 --> 03:11:53,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for us it was on at 3, but I think it was timed for when elementary kids get out of school, so it makes sense.

2518
03:11:54,054 --> 03:11:59,156
[SPEAKER_04]: and if I missed it on one PBS station, I could catch it on another PBS station like an hour or a half hour later.

2519
03:11:59,196 --> 03:12:00,116
[SPEAKER_04]: You have more than one?

2520
03:12:00,136 --> 03:12:01,496
[SPEAKER_04]: He's New York City, dude.

2521
03:12:01,936 --> 03:12:09,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have PBS 13, there's Channel 21, there's 25, there's... There's like 50 PBSes.

2522
03:12:09,839 --> 03:12:11,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never heard of this before.

2523
03:12:11,119 --> 03:12:12,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It's New Jersey Network that we get Channel 50.

2524
03:12:13,380 --> 03:12:14,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we get a few of them.

2525
03:12:14,920 --> 03:12:16,981
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Channel 6, take it or leave it.

2526
03:12:19,315 --> 03:12:22,937
[SPEAKER_02]: At the minute of how you have your antenna, you can pick up stations from Connecticut.

2527
03:12:23,018 --> 03:12:25,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right, because there's a PBS9 in Reading.

2528
03:12:25,679 --> 03:12:27,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, cool story, bro.

2529
03:12:28,481 --> 03:12:31,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about TV channels in your neck of the woods.

2530
03:12:31,503 --> 03:12:33,865
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, let's not, let's not.

2531
03:12:35,026 --> 03:12:45,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I just realized, with Nintendo rehashing all of these video games, Nintendo's becoming that old celebrity that's trying to relive their prime with yet another Greatest Hits.

2532
03:12:46,393 --> 03:12:48,215
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's like this time, you know?

2533
03:12:48,255 --> 03:12:48,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like...

2534
03:12:48,775 --> 03:13:12,866
[SPEAKER_04]: You first have Donkey Kong Country and Donkey Kong Country Returns Donkey Kong Country comes back again I think the next one is going to be Donkey Kong Country comes out of retirement The only difference is maybe extra level or redone music or something like that Donkey Kong is getting up there in age Yeah, how about Donkey Kong gets out of retirement home Are you looking forward to the new Donkey Kong Country game or are you over it?

2535
03:13:13,689 --> 03:13:14,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm over it.

2536
03:13:14,429 --> 03:13:18,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I'm only picking up a Wii U once, Bayonetta 2, and Mario Kart 8 comes out.

2537
03:13:18,731 --> 03:13:20,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, it can wait.

2538
03:13:20,612 --> 03:13:21,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 8 is what, April?

2539
03:13:22,933 --> 03:13:23,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2540
03:13:23,653 --> 03:13:26,594
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they really have a date yet for it, but I think it was around April.

2541
03:13:26,934 --> 03:13:27,614
[SPEAKER_02]: April or May-ish.

2542
03:13:27,714 --> 03:13:29,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I am living for Mario Kart 8.

2543
03:13:30,255 --> 03:13:31,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It better deliver.

2544
03:13:32,836 --> 03:13:34,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it gets delayed, I'm like,

2545
03:13:35,986 --> 03:13:40,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if it's a great Mario Kart game, it'll be worth the wait.

2546
03:13:41,448 --> 03:13:44,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2547
03:13:44,209 --> 03:13:45,289
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of things.

2548
03:13:45,449 --> 03:13:49,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I think last week or week before, I talked about podcasting and the Sound Blaster card and stuff.

2549
03:13:51,691 --> 03:13:54,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Any desktop PC off the shelf can do the same thing.

2550
03:13:55,185 --> 03:13:57,266
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go into the settings and enable it.

2551
03:13:57,606 --> 03:13:58,106
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it.

2552
03:13:58,526 --> 03:13:58,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2553
03:13:59,307 --> 03:14:02,008
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, my studio computer doesn't do it so well.

2554
03:14:02,048 --> 03:14:08,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to point out, just for our listeners, Ranma's call quality is dropping significantly, so that's why his voice kind of changed a little bit.

2555
03:14:08,851 --> 03:14:09,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's going on.

2556
03:14:10,011 --> 03:14:11,412
[SPEAKER_02]: He might need to stop his porn torrents.

2557
03:14:12,112 --> 03:14:20,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, no, I just, sometimes, you know, with all the 50 PBSes transmitting signals in New York City, sometimes the signal gets a little clogged.

2558
03:14:21,036 --> 03:14:23,677
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure following porn by PBS, never mind.

2559
03:14:24,983 --> 03:14:51,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma, I think you're right, it is my porn torrents Finally, finally, somebody fesses that fuck up on this show Yes, Ranma, it was my porn torrents Thank you, you're an honest man I abused my files connection I get 66 megs coming down, 33 megs going up Alright, Ranma, a quick last thought to get out here before we let you go Yes, okay, my last thought is this Um

2560
03:14:51,576 --> 03:14:59,479
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to play classic Nintendo cartridges on your Wii U, turn your Wii U on, push start A, and a slot will pop up for classic cartridges.

2561
03:15:00,639 --> 03:15:03,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, go post that to 4chan and see if somebody believes you.

2562
03:15:04,201 --> 03:15:12,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Ranma, it's getting very crackly and stuff, so I really have to let you go, but thanks so much for the call, and have a good one, okay?

2563
03:15:13,646 --> 03:15:14,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, bye.

2564
03:15:14,887 --> 03:15:18,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma, anime jam session on Tuesday nights, everybody, here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

2565
03:15:19,571 --> 03:15:21,072
[SPEAKER_02]: We can probably squeeze in one more call.

2566
03:15:22,413 --> 03:15:24,775
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little ad on my Skype right now I just want to point out.

2567
03:15:25,056 --> 03:15:28,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to friends while watching live TV with Skype on Xbox One.

2568
03:15:28,499 --> 03:15:28,679
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

2569
03:15:31,633 --> 03:15:33,175
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no box for me to respond.

2570
03:15:33,195 --> 03:15:39,321
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2571
03:15:39,481 --> 03:15:46,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to see if I can at least get to some of these Twitter topics because we had some good Twitter topics come in and we're falling a little behind here on the show.

2572
03:15:46,989 --> 03:15:48,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, did you have any last minute stories?

2573
03:15:49,388 --> 03:15:49,548
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2574
03:15:49,928 --> 03:15:50,128
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2575
03:15:50,329 --> 03:15:51,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2576
03:15:52,929 --> 03:15:53,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2577
03:15:54,170 --> 03:16:01,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Surtur wanted to ask, he hopes that Bobby and us talk about Gran Turismo 6 tonight.

2578
03:16:02,513 --> 03:16:03,113
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2579
03:16:03,833 --> 03:16:04,353
[SPEAKER_09]: We got it.

2580
03:16:04,734 --> 03:16:04,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2581
03:16:04,954 --> 03:16:06,654
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dan's been playing the crap out of it.

2582
03:16:07,174 --> 03:16:07,955
[SPEAKER_09]: He really liked it.

2583
03:16:08,035 --> 03:16:11,076
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he actually watched football, which made me wonder who replaced my husband.

2584
03:16:13,200 --> 03:16:14,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan doesn't usually watch football?

2585
03:16:14,642 --> 03:16:16,504
[SPEAKER_09]: He does sometimes, but usually with other people.

2586
03:16:16,604 --> 03:16:17,946
[SPEAKER_09]: He was in there watching it by himself.

2587
03:16:17,986 --> 03:16:19,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, where's my husband?

2588
03:16:20,590 --> 03:16:20,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Who are you?

2589
03:16:22,405 --> 03:16:28,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator tweets us and asks, Loki, quadruple cheese and quadruple bacon pizza or quadruple bacon double cheeseburger?

2590
03:16:28,849 --> 03:16:29,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I can answer that, pizza.

2591
03:16:30,951 --> 03:16:33,613
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because that much cheese on the pizza is actually not very good.

2592
03:16:34,053 --> 03:16:36,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Even extra cheese on the pizza is not very good.

2593
03:16:36,675 --> 03:16:46,141
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you do quadruple cheese, trust me, I've seen it before, it's not as good as you'd think because that's a lot of grease you're adding on there and it just throws off the magic ratio.

2594
03:16:46,721 --> 03:16:47,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Adding tons of bacon, though.

2595
03:16:47,882 --> 03:16:48,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Go right ahead.

2596
03:16:48,742 --> 03:16:50,483
[SPEAKER_02]: You're taking that question way too seriously.

2597
03:16:50,903 --> 03:16:51,383
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

2598
03:16:51,903 --> 03:16:54,404
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you didn't take it far enough, to be honest.

2599
03:16:54,424 --> 03:16:57,285
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2600
03:16:57,305 --> 03:17:02,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that was on our end, because we were getting more calls a minute ago, and now nothing is lighting up.

2601
03:17:02,147 --> 03:17:02,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad face.

2602
03:17:03,148 --> 03:17:04,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2603
03:17:04,388 --> 03:17:04,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2604
03:17:06,349 --> 03:17:12,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft tweeted us, there's more info surrounding the Legend of Sonic 3's soundtrack.

2605
03:17:12,652 --> 03:17:15,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if this ties into the whole Michael Jackson thing, because wasn't there a

2606
03:17:16,724 --> 03:17:19,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there like a... Somebody ran a whole thing on that.

2607
03:17:19,987 --> 03:17:20,748
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't like it.

2608
03:17:20,888 --> 03:17:32,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Jackson didn't like the limitations of the sound chip, didn't like the way the... He didn't like the results of the soundtrack, so they still kept some of the inspiration, but ultimately he wasn't credited and specifically involved.

2609
03:17:32,259 --> 03:17:34,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, though, this actually doesn't have to do with the game trailers thing.

2610
03:17:34,941 --> 03:17:40,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, and this is the story that Actdeft leaked us just to kind of try to cover this quickly.

2611
03:17:40,965 --> 03:17:50,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Fervor Records on YouTube posted some unreleased music tracks from the band The Jetsons.

2612
03:17:50,871 --> 03:17:52,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the Jetsons, but the Jetsons.

2613
03:17:53,213 --> 03:17:53,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Clever.

2614
03:17:53,733 --> 03:17:59,557
[SPEAKER_02]: And one track called Hard Times was somewhat like the theme of Ice Cap Zone.

2615
03:18:00,057 --> 03:18:17,057
[SPEAKER_02]: well why does that fucking matter because the keyboardist of the group who is Brad Buxer worked on the title along with Michael Jackson which he said in an interview he's not sure what material the developers used in the game but I guess it was remnants of that unreleased song very interesting so

2616
03:18:18,439 --> 03:18:18,880
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2617
03:18:18,920 --> 03:18:20,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Jackson had something to do with it.

2618
03:18:20,701 --> 03:18:27,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And because Michael Jackson is such a perfectionist, I would fully believe that he just didn't like the way it was turning out, so he walked away from it.

2619
03:18:27,247 --> 03:18:27,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Easily.

2620
03:18:27,748 --> 03:18:28,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Easily.

2621
03:18:28,368 --> 03:18:31,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the simple story we have there.

2622
03:18:33,133 --> 03:18:35,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get to the calls real quick here.

2623
03:18:35,315 --> 03:18:36,315
[SPEAKER_02]: We got one more call coming in.

2624
03:18:36,335 --> 03:18:37,256
[SPEAKER_02]: This will probably be it for tonight.

2625
03:18:37,276 --> 03:18:38,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2626
03:18:38,237 --> 03:18:38,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2627
03:18:40,239 --> 03:18:40,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Zaku.

2628
03:18:40,920 --> 03:18:41,720
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't heard from you in a while.

2629
03:18:41,740 --> 03:18:42,161
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, buddy?

2630
03:18:43,214 --> 03:18:43,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, not that much.

2631
03:18:44,114 --> 03:18:48,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to chill on my night off.

2632
03:18:49,877 --> 03:18:53,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody turned out the lights, but we're getting a lot of video calls tonight.

2633
03:18:53,619 --> 03:18:54,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this.

2634
03:18:54,179 --> 03:18:55,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's up, buddy?

2635
03:18:56,368 --> 03:18:58,230
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just trying to clean up Steam right now.

2636
03:18:58,250 --> 03:19:01,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I managed to get a second hard drive.

2637
03:19:01,994 --> 03:19:13,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, two of them set up in RAID, but the idea is I'm going to start moving my Steam games towards that one and then actually downloading whatever else I don't have, whatever else is in my backlog right now.

2638
03:19:14,808 --> 03:19:17,652
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like you woke up at 6 in the morning to call this program.

2639
03:19:17,672 --> 03:19:17,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2640
03:19:19,253 --> 03:19:21,056
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like getting ready to go to bed.

2641
03:19:21,758 --> 03:19:22,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

2642
03:19:22,278 --> 03:19:22,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

2643
03:19:22,679 --> 03:19:24,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't mind the sore throat and congestion.

2644
03:19:25,023 --> 03:19:26,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you playing on Steam then?

2645
03:19:26,606 --> 03:19:30,312
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your big Steam games of choice that you got to move everything around to make space and stuff?

2646
03:19:31,294 --> 03:19:36,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm just trying to get stuff like the orange box, all the other half-life games.

2647
03:19:37,138 --> 03:19:41,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I lost track and never actually got around to downloading it.

2648
03:19:42,561 --> 03:19:49,626
[SPEAKER_00]: And then stuff like the first two Mass Effects that I have and Sleeping Dogs.

2649
03:19:51,477 --> 03:19:51,757
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

2650
03:20:16,918 --> 03:20:44,206
[SPEAKER_00]: um I I guess have you noticed like um I don't know if you cover this already but remember that fighting game Skullgirls yes yeah I get to play that tonight um apparently in two weeks their publisher Konami is uh pulling their games from the PSN and Xbox I caught you you did wake up just to call this show because we did talk about that about an hour ago so yes we touched on some of the basics of that but what what are your thoughts with that

2651
03:20:45,748 --> 03:20:48,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I mean, this is typical behavior of them.

2652
03:20:49,781 --> 03:21:01,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it's them like, you know, screwing over ITG or basically not giving a shit about the Mimani series, it's them screwing over independent developers.

2653
03:21:02,064 --> 03:21:19,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hold on though, because I mean, and granted, I'm not going to claim to be up and up on Skullgirls and everything that's going on, but my understanding from what I'm reading is that they had an agreement, the agreement is ending as of such and such date, so Konami says, well, if we're not going to be making money from this anymore, then yank, it's getting pulled.

2654
03:21:19,827 --> 03:21:26,652
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't even inform their developers.

2655
03:21:29,274 --> 03:21:30,835
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it behind their back.

2656
03:21:30,975 --> 03:21:39,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they probably knew about the end of the agreement, but they didn't even give them a heads up so they can plan a transition.

2657
03:21:41,633 --> 03:21:43,254
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like bad business practice.

2658
03:21:43,714 --> 03:21:58,243
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unprofessional of them, especially if you're in a contract with another company that you're working with and you don't have the wherewithal to provide for a smooth transition for all the other customers using it.

2659
03:21:58,945 --> 03:22:07,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask you this, because, you know, what would be the best way to kind of give that message to Konami that you're not happy with what they did?

2660
03:22:07,489 --> 03:22:12,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously the answer is not boycotting Skullgirls because, you know, you want to support that game.

2661
03:22:12,191 --> 03:22:12,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not the answer.

2662
03:22:13,452 --> 03:22:17,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think boycotting all Konami products is really a realistic answer.

2663
03:22:17,814 --> 03:22:19,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they don't have much that comes out in console.

2664
03:22:19,595 --> 03:22:21,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's not enough stuff coming out.

2665
03:22:21,556 --> 03:22:28,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So if gamers are really pissed off about this, Zaku, like you are, what do you think is the best way we can express that to Konami and make them listen?

2666
03:22:28,379 --> 03:22:32,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop buying their iOS and Android games because that's where all their business is now.

2667
03:22:33,244 --> 03:22:37,147
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically, I mean, Babani's gone mobile at this point.

2668
03:22:37,448 --> 03:22:49,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than niche pockets in arcades in certain parts of the country, if not the world, everything else is just them microtransactioning all their IPs, their music rhythm-based IPs.

2669
03:22:51,640 --> 03:22:52,741
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.

2670
03:22:52,961 --> 03:22:56,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's been the state of Bomani for a few years now, which is sad and depressing.

2671
03:22:56,284 --> 03:22:56,764
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even that.

2672
03:22:56,784 --> 03:23:07,032
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in general, the principle of an independent indie dev trying to find a publisher or give them the light of day, but then at the...

2673
03:23:07,768 --> 03:23:17,554
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, they're actually not giving them the professionalism that they gave them during the whole process.

2674
03:23:18,655 --> 03:23:30,422
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, it's really what happens when you try to work with other clients and those clients in particular don't want to give you everything necessary to achieve business goals.

2675
03:23:30,984 --> 03:23:36,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd be curious to see if Konami does end up having to respond to this at all, but I don't know.

2676
03:23:36,567 --> 03:23:44,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of have this weird feeling that they probably won't, and gamers will support Skullgirls on PC later on, and that's that.

2677
03:23:45,032 --> 03:23:49,694
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're trying to do right now is they're trying to find another publisher.

2678
03:23:49,974 --> 03:23:53,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, in the short term, they're trying to get another build in.

2679
03:23:53,756 --> 03:23:57,559
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get an update in just to keep the game alive.

2680
03:23:58,679 --> 03:24:00,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Saku, I've got to...

2681
03:24:14,733 --> 03:24:15,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to wrap this up.

2682
03:24:15,773 --> 03:24:17,494
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to go because we're running way late.

2683
03:24:17,574 --> 03:24:18,914
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

2684
03:24:19,214 --> 03:24:27,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be curious to see what the response is on a greater scale to this because obviously there's a lot of people that are pretty unhappy about this.

2685
03:24:27,157 --> 03:24:28,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

2686
03:24:28,177 --> 03:24:30,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know if it's going to be enough to make waves.

2687
03:24:30,098 --> 03:24:30,478
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

2688
03:24:30,738 --> 03:24:30,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2689
03:24:31,258 --> 03:24:31,478
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2690
03:24:31,978 --> 03:24:32,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Zaku, take care, buddy.

2691
03:24:32,799 --> 03:24:33,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the call.

2692
03:24:33,339 --> 03:24:33,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

2693
03:24:33,879 --> 03:24:34,099
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2694
03:24:34,159 --> 03:24:34,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleep well.

2695
03:24:34,699 --> 03:24:34,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2696
03:24:34,999 --> 03:24:35,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2697
03:24:35,399 --> 03:24:37,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Vitamin C. You look like you have a cold.

2698
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:39,920
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no more phone numbers.

2699
03:24:40,141 --> 03:24:44,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're running long tonight, so we've got to wrap it on up.

2700
03:24:44,661 --> 03:24:50,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But please, you can always email us your thoughts, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2701
03:24:50,443 --> 03:24:54,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one other Twitter topic I wanted to hit on, and we didn't have last-minute stories, right?

2702
03:24:55,744 --> 03:25:06,386
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt tweeted us, this is sports ball related, but someone took the Alabama versus Auburn unbelievable final play and remade it in Tecmo Bowl.

2703
03:25:07,895 --> 03:25:09,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I have to watch that.

2704
03:25:10,338 --> 03:25:13,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody put this in a way that would make Jamie and I care.

2705
03:25:14,381 --> 03:25:15,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the news I'm hearing here.

2706
03:25:15,823 --> 03:25:17,264
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I have to show it to my mother.

2707
03:25:18,265 --> 03:25:19,846
[SPEAKER_09]: My mom was reporting for Alabama.

2708
03:25:19,866 --> 03:25:21,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Tecmo Bowl is great.

2709
03:25:21,568 --> 03:25:23,510
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we got to wrap it up.

2710
03:25:23,550 --> 03:25:29,575
[SPEAKER_02]: We are so done because this is almost a four-hour show tonight, and it's not even a marathon show.

2711
03:25:29,855 --> 03:25:32,678
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you guys for staying with us tonight the whole way through.

2712

2718
03:25:48,147 --> 03:25:49,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that was iTunes podcast.

2719
03:25:50,148 --> 03:25:55,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher Radio has been doing great for us lately, and we really want to thank the folks at Stitcher.

2720
03:25:55,311 --> 03:25:59,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys know this, but we broke the top 15 game shows this past week.

2721
03:25:59,154 --> 03:26:00,214
[SPEAKER_02]: That blows my mind.

2722
03:26:00,234 --> 03:26:00,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

[SPEAKER_02]: Always, always, always.

2726
03:26:24,326 --> 03:26:30,488
[SPEAKER_02]: What people may not realize, you have to drive an hour and 45 minutes to get here one way on a Sunday.

2727
03:26:30,828 --> 03:26:32,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And you do it for this show.

2728
03:26:32,389 --> 03:26:33,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Twice.

2729
03:26:33,390 --> 03:26:35,750

03:26:39,752 --> 03:26:44,494
[SPEAKER_02]: This show would not be possible without you, literally, because you've also helped us with many a web thing.

03:26:44,574 --> 03:26:45,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, thank you.

2734
03:26:45,655 --> 03:26:46,475
[SPEAKER_12]: I always look forward to it.

2735
03:26:47,075 --> 03:26:48,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2736
03:26:51,620 --> 03:26:55,163
[SPEAKER_12]: I am doing a very good job of having ideas, not writing them down and forgetting them.

2737
03:26:55,503 --> 03:26:57,285
[SPEAKER_12]: So here is to forgetfulness.

2738
03:26:57,305 --> 03:26:58,626
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a laptop in front of you.

2739
03:26:58,646 --> 03:26:59,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

2740
03:26:59,927 --> 03:27:03,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Launch that notes application and have it open at all times, sir.

2741
03:27:04,071 --> 03:27:05,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I am definitely doing that from here on out.

2742
03:27:05,892 --> 03:27:06,453
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an order.

2743
03:27:06,953 --> 03:27:08,494
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2744
03:27:09,855 --> 03:27:36,672
[SPEAKER_14]: um I also forgot that I played Surgeon Simulator 2013 today or I should say I let my son watch me do that it was more like knocking stuff off desk simulator because that's what I was doing because he was too afraid of the actual surgeries it's like I don't like this game um so yeah so that's all I have alright and DarkSakura your final thought tonight

2745
03:27:37,426 --> 03:27:37,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Meh.

2746
03:27:38,913 --> 03:27:39,335
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why?

2747
03:27:39,556 --> 03:27:39,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

2748
03:27:40,259 --> 03:27:42,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I went Pinkberry and it's not cheat day.

2749
03:27:45,465 --> 03:27:47,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to leave it at that.

2750
03:27:48,668 --> 03:27:50,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I may or may not have something in the freezer right now.

2751
03:27:52,532 --> 03:27:53,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll save it.

2752
03:27:53,493 --> 03:27:54,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You bitch!

2753
03:27:54,393 --> 03:27:55,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll save it.

2754
03:27:56,495 --> 03:28:02,521
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought for the night is candy canes are the best thing about Christmas.

2755
03:28:03,442 --> 03:28:04,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Candy canes are the best thing about Christmas.

2756
03:28:05,284 --> 03:28:07,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And that new candy cane flavor at Pinkberry?

2757
03:28:07,806 --> 03:28:08,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2758
03:28:09,147 --> 03:28:09,407
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

2759
03:28:35,086 --> 03:28:36,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, quickly, because we're going to play the credits.

2760
03:28:36,989 --> 03:28:45,100
[SPEAKER_09]: We were at Golfland, and they had these big Pepsi bong bone drink things, and so I let Rob have a sip of it, and I said, I don't have cooties or anything.

2761
03:28:45,120 --> 03:28:47,303
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, okay, and took a drink, passed it back, and goes, I have gay.

2762
03:28:48,525 --> 03:28:50,968
[SPEAKER_09]: And Irene was there, and I was like, oh my god, Irene, let's date.

2763
03:28:54,269 --> 03:28:55,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the rest of the day, you did.

2764
03:28:57,591 --> 03:28:58,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

2765
03:28:58,232 --> 03:28:58,852
[SPEAKER_02]: She just shrugged.

2766
03:28:59,072 --> 03:28:59,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

2767
03:29:00,373 --> 03:29:02,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, Irene's pretty cute.

2768
03:29:04,676 --> 03:29:07,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys again for downloading the show and checking it out.

2769
03:29:07,198 --> 03:29:08,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate it.

2770
03:29:08,358 --> 03:29:10,220
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back to do this all again next week.

2771
03:29:10,480 --> 03:29:11,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Same bat time, same bat channel.

2772
03:29:12,501 --> 03:29:14,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great week in your gaming, whatever it is you're playing.

2773
03:29:14,843 --> 03:29:15,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Just have fun.

2774
03:29:15,863 --> 03:29:17,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an exciting time to be a gamer.

2775
03:29:17,845 --> 03:29:18,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

2776
03:29:18,991 --> 03:29:19,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching.

2777
03:29:48,974 --> 03:29:50,034
