00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,160
The Video Game Awards have come and gone and some exciting news has come out of it.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,640
Telltale picks up not one but two huge franchises slated for 2014.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,040
While one may be the worst kept secret, the other may surprise you.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,760
Your reactions, phone calls, and more on the show where every video gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,360
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:45,700
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode 530 for this December the 8th of 2013.

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,520
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me over the next few hours to talk video games and

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,400
gaming culture and gamer lulls and probably a lot of other miscellaneous talk too.

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,120
We have to fill three hours somehow.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,640
She's joining me as she does every week.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,840
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
Hi.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
How are you?

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Educated.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Educated.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
The more you know.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,800
Did you read a book today?

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,120
No, I've been watching documentaries all week.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,640
Because that's what LeVar Burton taught me growing up.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
Take a look, it's in a book.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Reading Rainbow.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Exactly.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,200
I've been watching documentaries all week.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Oh, there you go.

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,960
They've been very interesting.

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,800
When I first got Netflix, or I should say, well when Netflix was first first out it was

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,120
only the DVDs, right?

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,960
So when I first got the Netflix streaming, whenever that was, it was a couple of years

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
ago, right?

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Well, you know, ish.

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,840
One of the first things I did is I binged watched documentaries.

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,500
Like I went through that phase too because, you know, Netflix streaming doesn't always

34
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,240
have a lot of the current stuff, but they have a lot of the really like low budget,

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,820
I'm using my pointy fingers, like documentaries and stuff.

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,080
So it's a great thing to binge on.

37
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,700
There's actually YouTube channels now that are all documentaries.

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,840
And I've been watching a series called Extraordinary People on I think a few years ago in the UK.

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,200
And they really, really, really like autistic savants, but they meet people all over the

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
world.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
It's actually really cool.

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,180
And a lot of surgery ones too, like people with odd growths on their face.

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,520
Speaking of British, I noticed that Netflix is, and this is like a paid advertisement

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
for them.

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
We don't get paid.

46
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Pay us Netflix.

47
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,840
There's no little code we have or anything, but they do, they have a lot of BBC and British

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
programming on there.

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,940
I noticed that too, which is pretty awesome.

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,480
So do not insult Reading Rainbow by applying My Little Pony to it.

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
What are you looking at?

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,280
Our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,880
Of course you can join us in our chat.

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,080
What did Act Def say there?

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,240
Oh, Reading Rainbow dash.

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,580
Live.vognetwork.com.

57
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,120
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,800
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,140
Also joining us here in studio tonight.

60
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,140
Hello.

62
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
How you doing, Loki?

63
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,140
I'm fine.

64
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,140
Awesome.

65
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,140
Awesome.

66
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,040
So, you know, there's a little, little parlor game that some of our chatters like to play,

67
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,840
which is what food did Loki bring to the show tonight?

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,880
And an old favorite returns tonight.

69
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,080
I haven't seen you bring this in like six months, but what did you bring to the show

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
tonight?

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Triple bacon pizza.

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
Triple bacon pizza.

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,820
Good for the heart.

74
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Low in sodium.

75
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,820
Yep.

76
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,820
All right.

77
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Amazing.

78
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,820
I'll enjoy it.

79
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,300
Also joining us in the studio tonight as he has been on and off since Thanksgiving because

80
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,300
he's spending the holidays in the area.

81
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,040
So why not give it up for VX Jason XV, X, Y, Z, L, N, O, P.

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
DBQ LOL.

83
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,940
I'm sure everybody's very surprised to hear my voice again, but always great to be here

84
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,940
as usual.

85
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
And always nice to have you.

86
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm it's we get adjacent for the holidays.

87
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,440
It's my Christmas present to everybody.

88
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,360
No, it's, it's, it's always great to have you are we, the more people in the studio,

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,720
the merrier, you know, unfortunately you don't get a lot of, it would be great if we were

90
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,900
all in San Francisco or something where a lot of people kind of come through and make

91
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,440
you losers drive an hour and a half to get down there to me.

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Yeah.

93
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,800
In Sacramento, it's a little harder to get the people up here to actually sit in studio

94
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
with us.

95
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,360
But, uh, you know, if you're ever in the area, let me know, always open a guest.

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,180
It's it's, it's, it's conveniently located.

97
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,040
You guys have an airport, you guys have a train station, you don't have an airport and

98
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,240
running water, the whole government in California, 40 degree temperature week.

99
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,080
And yeah, isn't that hilarious?

100
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,720
How cold I'm using my 20 fingers, how cold it is right now.

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,640
But it's like I tell people, um, you know, or like when it rains, you know, dark soccer

102
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,800
loves to say, California, you guys don't know the rain.

103
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,200
You got to spend some time in the south where it really rains or you know, what have you.

104
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,240
But what about the rains in South Africa?

105
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,880
What about the rains in Spain?

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Falls mainly on the plane.

107
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Okay.

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Toto.

109
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,840
Um, uh, uh, the record, the weather right now is like February in Alabama.

110
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,760
Well, I was gonna say though, one thing to keep in mind, we're not built for certain

111
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
things.

112
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,800
Like if it were to rain here, like it is in the south, we'd all be under water.

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,640
We'd be part of the ocean, right?

114
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,600
And now all of your houses would fall over.

115
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,480
And with the cold, you know, we have, we have like outdoor pipes and stuff here is

116
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
very common.

117
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
And when it gets really cold.

118
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
And houses made out of plywood.

119
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Yeah.

120
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,840
Wrap your pipes, bring your pets in cause it's just not normal here.

121
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,480
So you've never had to know the pleasure of filling your bathtub full of water and putting

122
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,880
a teaspoon of bleach in it so that you have clean water when your water stops working

123
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,280
after a hurricane.

124
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
No thank you.

125
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,440
You've never seen a tree the width of this table be uprooted right in front of your eyes.

126
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,280
I will take the earth shaking randomly under my feet any day.

127
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,520
I will take a hurricane any day.

128
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,600
So it's 36 degrees here right now.

129
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,560
Is this when I, is this when we play guess what it is in Colorado right now?

130
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,920
Negative 20 I'm sure.

131
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Close.

132
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
That's the feels like.

133
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
No.

134
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,480
It is currently nine degrees and will be one degree before the show is over.

135
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Wow.

136
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,420
What up G in chat at live.voggenetwork.com says, I love the snowball games today.

137
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,960
You know, not, not that we talk a lot about sports ball here on, here on OLR, but I got

138
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,880
to say, I actually saw some of that game today.

139
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Yes I did.

140
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,720
I saw some footballs today and uh, that was hardcore that they were out there playing

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
in the snow and like it's the type of thing where like that you can't even see the damn

142
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,720
lines that like they have to project the lines out there cause you can't even see them cause

143
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
the damn snow.

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
They're paid employees.

145
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,640
They better play in any kind of conditions.

146
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,980
Oh no Rob, you were, you were a band geek.

147
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,960
So how about this marching competition in the snow?

148
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,320
We never had the snow, but we had to do field show once in the pouring rain and so many

149
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
of us slipped and fell.

150
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,740
Like I slipped and fell in a mud thing, but you just get right back up and keep going.

151
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,760
The last marching band competition I did was in Prattville, Alabama, which Prattville,

152
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,520
um, and it was in the snow and we were all fucking cold and you had all the clarinet

153
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,800
players that had the fingers cut out of their gloves.

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,240
Did you play clarinet?

155
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,320
No, Jamie played saxophone.

156
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,160
All right.

157
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,640
Anyhow we could talk band geek stories all night, but it is a video gaming show.

158
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,120
So let's get back to the topic of video games at hand.

159
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,740
Uh, tonight's kickoff topic.

160
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,860
Ricky is actually going to start us off with our kickoff topic tonight.

161
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,980
It's something a lot of people on Twitter and everything's been talking about.

162
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,220
So I'm sure some of you are wondering when we were going to bring it up.

163
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
So here you go.

164
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,220
Yeah.

165
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,460
It's just, we're going to talk a little bit about the VGX award show thing that they had

166
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,620
yesterday on spike and it was also streamed on Twitch and all that fun stuff.

167
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,300
Lots of interesting things coming out of that.

168
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,060
Um, mostly just some new trailers for things, um, announcements of some things we'll get

169
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,060
into later in the show.

170
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,540
Some other stuff we'll get into later and, um, uh, at least one cool game that, um, or

171
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,900
brand new game that I saw, um, well actually it was several brand new games, but one from

172
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,340
like an indie developer, um, that was, uh, no man's sky that looked pretty awesome.

173
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,500
It was kind of stole the show and at least that seems to be the consensus.

174
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,340
Um, I saw that trailer cause I did not watch the VGX, but I, I, and I kind of always said,

175
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm like, any of the good stuff will be on YouTube afterwards.

176
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
So yeah.

177
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,520
I did see that trailer and it was, it was neat, but I couldn't like, I was like, well,

178
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
what's the game?

179
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,960
Like, you know, it looked neat how it was going from underwater to land, a sky to space

180
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,360
in just like one fluid motion and the art style was very neat.

181
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,480
So yeah, I was kind of like, Oh, this is neat, but what is it a shooter?

182
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,440
Cause I see bullets being counted in the corner.

183
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,720
Is it a, what the heck game is it?

184
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I don't know.

185
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Yeah.

186
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,400
That's the only thing that kind of gets me about it is I'm like, all right, cool story,

187
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
bro.

188
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,640
What's the game?

189
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
It just looks interesting.

190
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Yeah.

191
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,880
And then, you know, I, I look forward to the next chapter and what this game's on.

192
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm not dissing the game.

193
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,320
It looked really good, but I just, I'm curious, you know, well, okay.

194
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
What else is there?

195
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Well, okay.

196
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,920
So basically the, the main thing about this is there's been a lot of conflicting opinions

197
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,680
about the show since this is going to kind of a whole change of venue for, you know,

198
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
the VGAs.

199
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,920
Now it's this new, there's no audience really.

200
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,200
It's just kind of this studio set and they have developers on, they're interviewing them

201
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,700
with different things.

202
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,840
To me, it seemed like a very long version of, you know, their game trailers show that

203
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,440
they normally have on, on Spike and except, you know, they gave out awards and they had

204
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,880
Joel McHale and a lot of people didn't like Joel McHale because they thought he was just,

205
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,560
you know, hating on the entire show and not taking anything seriously.

206
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,320
And which, I mean, if you're a paid presenter, you're, I don't think that he's doing that

207
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
on purpose.

208
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,760
But whatever, um, and you know, he made some major faux pas as well.

209
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,880
That should be called out.

210
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,320
Like he, and to some people you may go, Oh, what's the big deal.

211
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,800
But you know, again, if you're trying to break out of that whole machismo, you know, gaming

212
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,200
culture and it's only for a certain type of people, especially coming off last week when

213
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,620
we had a guest that was really talking about inclusive games, you know, Joel McHale made

214
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,560
a pretty off joke in the first 10 minutes of the show, something about Wario getting

215
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,160
a sex change, which can be construed as transphobic, which, you know, I realize there's a fine

216
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,720
line between are we too sensitive about getting offended easily and you know, and so forth.

217
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,720
But it's just kind of the thing where it's like, you know, I just, as a joke like that

218
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,600
kind of just leaves me very like sour puss face when we're all about trying to include

219
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,400
more people in gaming culture.

220
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Let's get away from gaming being just about dude bros and, and that sort of thing.

221
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,760
But I don't know, maybe Spike TV feels some sort of allegiance to that demographic.

222
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
I don't know.

223
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,980
But I just, when I, again, I didn't watch it, but I heard about it and I was just kind

224
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,980
of, I just kind of made a sour face.

225
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,040
Well, some of the things like that he said were kind of ironic, I guess, because you

226
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,600
know, the whole thing he's like, he's like, yeah, we're going to have lots of, you know,

227
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,640
trailers and demos and basically stuff that you can consider one long giant, you know,

228
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,600
video game commercial or something.

229
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,120
And I understand that it's supposed to be a joke, but at the same time, that's kind

230
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
of what this is.

231
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,040
It's just a big fucking commercial for these games.

232
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,840
And that's why the whole thing kind of seems like a joke in the first place.

233
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,260
If you want to say even more of a joke than the VGA's were, at least the VGA's was actually

234
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,060
presented like an award show and you could kind of imagine, or at least you make believe

235
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,960
that it's an award show and not necessarily something that is used to drive certain properties

236
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,320
ahead and good for marketing and that kind of stuff.

237
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,860
But I just don't know, it's harder to take this seriously, especially when they come

238
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,380
out of the gate looking like this and it looks ridiculous.

239
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,300
It's kind of like, you know, if we had a bigger budget or like if someone had a bigger budget

240
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,460
out there and just filmed themselves talking about what they think is the best games, even

241
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:26,360
though I know that they had an internet poll to nail down some of those winners and stuff.

242
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,020
But I just, I don't know, I can't really take it seriously.

243
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,960
Let me ask this question, then why do we, as a gaming culture, I mean these things only

244
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:40,120
have enough clout and power as we give it, why do we continue, and I'm even accusing

245
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,760
ourselves here, why are we even talking about it?

246
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Why is gaming culture obsessed with this show?

247
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,120
Because Spike TV clearly wrote it off, they'd rather air cops rerun it.

248
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,920
I think people are more obsessed about the show because of the exclusive trailers and

249
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,040
stuff that they show off.

250
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,260
It's basically the new stuff that we get to see that people, I don't think really a lot

251
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:06,700
of people, aside from getting an affirmation that, hey, X series that I like got an award

252
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,500
or something like that, look, I'm justified in my liking this series or something, or

253
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
complaining about that.

254
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:19,620
The general video game culture conflict between different people and opinions and stuff like

255
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
that.

256
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,000
But for me, that's kind of one of the reasons I would tune in, is just because of the new

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
trailers.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,260
And yeah, I know I could swatch them online, which I was going to do, but I just saw that

259
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,680
there was a link to a stream, oh yeah, I didn't know they were streaming that online, I checked

260
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,840
out about 10 minutes of it, and thankfully saw that trailer for No Man's Sky, my son

261
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,000
was watching too, and he's like, I want to see that trailer again, I want to see that

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
trailer again.

263
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let me get a couple comments here, Jamie.

264
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,280
Well, I was just thinking that, part of me wonders how much of it is driven by sponsors.

265
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,540
If they're getting X amount of revenue dollars, then they have a continued reason to keep

266
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,380
doing it in whatever way they want to, as long as they keep getting the money in, right?

267
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,380
Of course.

268
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,380
Jason?

269
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,520
I was just going to say, it's the leaving sports ball on in the background to watch

270
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,340
the commercials effect.

271
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,020
So you think a lot of people were watching it very passively, where it's like, well,

272
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,760
it's a Saturday, there's nothing better.

273
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,640
Award shows are long, and there's enough, it's something that you don't necessarily

274
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,240
have to see just until you have to.

275
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,180
So you can glean a lot of information by having it on and having it around in lieu

276
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,220
of doing something else, but then as soon as they talk about a studio that you really

277
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,660
enjoy or a game you're chomping at the bit to see more content of, it's like, okay, now

278
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,180
I'm going to pay attention, I'm going to give my active attention to this instead of my

279
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,180
passive attention.

280
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,940
And also the thing kind of represents, a lot of people think Jeff is kind of a corporate

281
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:46,660
sellout, especially with the whole Doritos and Mountain Dew thing, and they have him

282
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,120
dress up like the Doritos pope and stuff.

283
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,640
Well, this is almost like an example of corporate sellout type of thing.

284
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,720
I'm going to say something that actually might surprise some people.

285
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,280
I'm going to defend him a little bit, because I kind of think at his core, he is really

286
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,560
not a sellout.

287
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:12,140
I actually think at his core, he really is a gamer like you and me wanting to do a job

288
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,180
out there.

289
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,360
I think to some extent what's happened is, it's either this or nothing.

290
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,940
And I think he kind of realizes that.

291
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,600
In some ways, I think this was kind of a last ditch effort to kind of save this sort of

292
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
thing on Spike.

293
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,280
I mean, let's be real, it wasn't on TV.

294
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,240
This thing was on its way out the door of broadcast TV or whatever.

295
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,760
However they want to spin it, the reality is they showed cops reruns instead.

296
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,300
So I kind of think at his core, he wants to do good things, but unfortunately there's

297
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,060
only so much those sponsor people and the suits and the people that are so out of touch

298
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,100
to this are willing to go.

299
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,340
So maybe that's why he was open to the idea of turning to the internet and trying to let

300
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,760
it sort of go a new direction and so forth.

301
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,140
So I give him credit for that, but unfortunately it's kind of one of those, this was your chance

302
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
and you blew it.

303
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Well here's the thing is, I don't think that it, why is everyone so situated on the fact

304
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,400
that this stuff needs to be on TV?

305
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,520
Most people nowadays, especially in the gaming community, don't watch a lot of TV.

306
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,320
It's all about internet stuff now, all internet broadcast shows.

307
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,560
Hell, you have people that used to be on TV like Adam Sessler doing web shows now.

308
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,360
You know, I'm sure that he could easily, hell, he's backed by game trailers.

309
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,040
He could easily go to game trailers and have his own damn show that's more serious and

310
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,500
still has the same type of people on there.

311
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:45,060
And he doesn't have to bow to the corporate sponsors of Spike or whatever, MTV, to have

312
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,340
all this nonsense that's in there.

313
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,660
That's what I think they need to do.

314
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,640
There is definitely a way out of, it's not this or nothing, there's plenty of options

315
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
out there.

316
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,200
It's just they try to do it again, and props to Spike for at least still considering gaming

317
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,140
as a viable thing to have on their network, because fuck, G4 just gave up on that.

318
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,880
Let me go to the chatroom, because there's a lot of comments on this, of course, in the

319
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,520
chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, it is the show where every gamer has a voice after all.

320
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,120
ActDeaf says, again, take out Joel and it would have been fine.

321
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,560
BlackWolf says, I like what they tried to do, but they needed to do it, not try.

322
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,580
And I bet, again, that's a little bit of the battle between the suits and so forth.

323
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,120
Bobby also goes on to say, you know, Jeff has done some amazing journalism stuff.

324
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,160
Jeff's The Final Hours reporting is wonderful, and I think a lot, I don't know a lot of people

325
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,180
that would argue with that.

326
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Exactly, and that's why it's kind of a disappointment.

327
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,700
I mean, his game trailer show's good, you know, I have nothing bad to say about that.

328
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,140
It's a great show.

329
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,780
And it's just, it's kind of embarrassing that he's this good, and yet here's this.

330
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,340
Here's a couple other comments that are really deep, and this is really good stuff.

331
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,340
SSJ100Matt says, and this is in response to why do these awards even exist and so forth.

332
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,980
SSJ100Matt says, because we're a society that needs a winner and a loser in something.

333
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,840
Award shows in general give people validation that their favorite thing is better than other

334
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,420
people's favorite thing.

335
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,280
Be damned if that doesn't hit the nail on the head.

336
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
100%.

337
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
100%.

338
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Absolutely.

339
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,420
I mean, and that's not even just games.

340
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,280
I just talked about football a minute ago.

341
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,560
I mean, isn't that kind of the big thing behind football?

342
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,320
My team's better than your team, right?

343
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,600
I mean, that's a lot of culture right there.

344
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,120
They have even the Espys.

345
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,480
Oh, yeah, well, yeah, and it's just not even, it's not even just that.

346
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
The Oscars.

347
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,560
Especially western culture.

348
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
The Oscars, right?

349
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:41,900
People get obsessed with being able to call the Oscar pool or whatever at work and that

350
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
whole thing.

351
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,780
I mean, that's just a part of culture.

352
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,780
Absolutely.

353
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,660
And especially in gaming.

354
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,700
Xbox One fanboys versus Sony fanboys versus Nintendo fanboys.

355
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,300
That absolutely goes on.

356
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,380
Well, then you've got the other people who just laugh at them.

357
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,380
Let's see.

358
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Also in our chat room.

359
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,080
I was actually going to say, but even that in and of itself is sort of a, some people

360
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,680
sort of get on their high horse about not being competitive.

361
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Right, right.

362
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Yeah, I know.

363
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Yeah, there is.

364
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,680
I mean, you have to have a little fun with it and you know, it's, you don't want it to

365
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,120
be the kind of thing where, oh, everybody wins an award because you know, I'm the kind

366
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,840
of guy that owns every console and I give everybody a fair opportunity.

367
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,240
I would like their income.

368
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,200
You know, Dan and I, Dan and I used to be in that boat and now we just like, we're kind

369
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,220
of like, we don't care anymore.

370
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
I guess.

371
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,660
Seriously, if I was making an income that he's probably making on, you know, that show,

372
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,940
I will wear a fucking Doritos Pope hat.

373
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,540
I don't care on TV.

374
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,700
I will sell out.

375
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,020
Akuma JP says my milkshake is better than yours.

376
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,020
Could you teach me?

377
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,020
Would you have to charge?

378
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,620
I have more boys in the yard.

379
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,780
Thank you for that, Jason.

380
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,580
Uh, when you're the one just sprouted up, when you're editing this, when you're editing

381
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,000
this week's show, be sure to crop out that little sense.

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
All right.

383
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,320
Uh, no, I really want to read this serious comment from Scott, a Tron, cause this is important

384
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,480
to in our chairman at live.com Scott, a Tron says, Joel kept making jokes about gamers

385
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,980
being virgins and living in their mother's basement.

386
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,960
Exactly what gamers want to hear during an award show for the gaming industry.

387
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Just dumb.

388
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,960
If you ask me and you know, I had that criticism.

389
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,160
When I came back from gamer X, I had a few choice words to say about one of the monologues

390
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:29,660
that I saw Pandora box give who, you know, she kind of made a lot of those jokes too.

391
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,900
And I'm like, okay, Pandora, you might be at like a G L B T Q I that whole thing quilt

392
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,900
bag or whatever it is.

393
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,420
You might be at one of these types of conventions, but it's also a gaming convention.

394
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,020
Don't get, don't get up here and offend gamers either.

395
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,820
And that was something I, you know, as much as I love her and still do, I just was really

396
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
put off by that.

397
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,620
Uh, when I came back from that, I just think Joel's material, maybe he's a little old cause

398
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,040
he was kind of doing that, you know, at the Ubisoft stuff when he, um, you know, was hosting

399
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
that.

400
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,240
It's just, it's getting new material, uh, but Rama counters with this and says, if geeks

401
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,440
can't make fun of themselves, then what the fuck are we?

402
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
But I don't know.

403
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,640
I think it's a little bit different when it is someone that you count on to do it appropriately.

404
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Yeah, I agree.

405
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
And I don't agree.

406
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Like I do agree.

407
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,720
We have to be able to get offended a little bit and that's why I'm not here raging more

408
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,600
about some of this, but it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, okay,

409
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,820
the, you're living in your basement shit is old.

410
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
It's old.

411
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,820
Joke is old.

412
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,820
Yeah.

413
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
It's kind of like these jokes we've heard before.

414
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,460
It's kind of like someone named Richard and someone calling him Dick is like, ah, yeah,

415
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,860
I've never heard that before.

416
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:39,580
You know, it's very sex change joke is just like you, you can do better than that.

417
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,580
It's tacky.

418
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,580
You can do better than that.

419
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,300
Like, especially in this day and age, like you're smarter than that.

420
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,180
It's like if you're going to go for the insulting jokes to be fun, to be funny, go from the

421
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,480
Lampanelli page, but don't, you know, don't think that you're actually being funny.

422
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,040
Go look at South Park cause I think that shit's really funny, but granted they offend everybody

423
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,600
and it's just, but anyway, that show has gotten incredibly stupid.

424
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
I don't know.

425
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,880
The last few episodes are pretty good.

426
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
All right.

427
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,720
Um, anyhow, so, so whatever.

428
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,440
I mean, again, I'm not, I'm not like, Oh my God, I'm so mad about the VGX.

429
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,040
I'm not mad about the VGX by any means.

430
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Yeah.

431
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
That's kind of where I'm at.

432
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm like literally asking the question where I'm like, why is this such a big fucking deal?

433
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,820
Kind of disappointed that there wasn't anything like, you know, a fallout four trailer and

434
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,060
it was just like, it's like, Hey, here's a new trailer for Titanfall.

435
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,060
Yeah.

436
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,060
Yeah.

437
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,700
I wish there was more new game announcements, you know, it was just kind of like, you know,

438
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,540
new trailers for games that we've already seen.

439
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,340
Keep in mind, we're at the halfway point between E3's too.

440
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,140
So I think there is definitely a, uh, a drive out there, a call for like a winter E3 type

441
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,140
of thing.

442
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,760
And I think the video game awards are a winter E3, a winty three, a wintry three, wintry

443
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
three.

444
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Yeah.

445
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
That type of thing.

446
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
You know what I mean?

447
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,080
Like a, like something, some news to be a tent pole between the different E3's, you

448
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,560
know, just something to kind of keep us going until the next one.

449
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
But I don't know.

450
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,100
I felt the announcements that came out of previous, the, the, the VGX's or whatever

451
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,120
were, were better, were stronger.

452
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
You know what I mean?

453
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,140
Then, then what we got this year, steam is more exciting.

454
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,620
Steam sales are a lot more exciting.

455
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,880
I probably shouldn't ask this question, but it just kind of spring to mind listening to

456
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
this.

457
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,840
Collectively, the four of us, are we out of touch?

458
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,680
No, Jason, because we're gamers and this is, this is, this is something we talked about

459
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,860
a little bit last week.

460
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,560
I don't think we're out of, I don't think we're out of touch because again, the crux

461
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,680
of the show is where every gamer has a voice.

462
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
We are gamers.

463
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
We have voices.

464
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
We use them.

465
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,160
So maybe that, maybe that's the wrong question to ask, but I, I really wish I could remember

466
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,460
the detail of something that I was thinking about in one of these last couple of weeks,

467
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,940
but basically what it boils down to is that there are, there are obviously multiple sides

468
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,700
to everything and there is nothing, there is nothing wrong with, with one individual's

469
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,820
opinion against the other.

470
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,120
They're both right, despite the points we just made five minutes ago.

471
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,920
But it's kind of like we, it's, it seems weird to me because collectively we've said the

472
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,940
same, it feels like we've said the same thing for a month, a big collective sigh at the

473
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:20,260
future, despite the fact that consoles continue to shatter all records constantly, console

474
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,260
sales and everything.

475
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,540
So out of touches, that was definitely the wrong question to ask, but I want to, it would

476
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:34,780
be very interesting to find how we, how we deviated from the fact that almost all of

477
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,340
us, if not all of us owned every console of the last generation, it was like, you know,

478
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,780
we grew up, we grew up with our parents and we had the one that we wanted or the one that

479
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,420
our parents got us.

480
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,380
And then we grew up more and we, we went for more and more.

481
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,200
And then we had jobs and we had income and we invested in the entire generation and took

482
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
everything in.

483
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,420
And now we're here, the door is open, we can do what we want and we'll get there.

484
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,500
But let me tell you where I think your viewpoint skewed a little bit because I mean, I, I get

485
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,820
where you're going with, with this, but there's, there's a couple of things that caught my

486
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
ear there.

487
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,140
One is that it's not that the future looks bleak for gaming.

488
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,660
I don't believe that.

489
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,680
It's just none of us were ready to jump on the bandwagon right now.

490
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,420
There's not the games to justify that right now.

491
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,380
But to say the future looks bleak, not necessarily.

492
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,140
There's some very exciting things on the horizon and, and we continue to push things forward.

493
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,900
I'll give you a great example, Jason.

494
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,780
It's something we don't talk about enough here on the show, the Oculus Rift.

495
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,020
Really freaking cool, right?

496
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,980
I know Bobby Blackwell's gonna back me up on that.

497
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:42,020
That quite literally changes everything because it was done, it was done to an incredibly

498
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,460
limited extent in the nineties and then it meaningfully disappeared until last year.

499
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,100
So does the future of gaming look bleak?

500
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
No.

501
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,900
As we get one step closer to the holodeck, the future of gaming looks awesome.

502
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,700
It is awesome because now we're going to get a new lawnmower man movie.

503
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,580
But do they, but do they, do they need my money right now?

504
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,580
I don't think so.

505
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,260
Jason, if you think back to those consoles you did have as a kid, how many of them did

506
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,340
your family really get on launch day?

507
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,340
I know my family.

508
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
Yes.

509
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,340
We had a Super Nintendo.

510
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
We had a Nintendo.

511
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,340
I got a PlayStation.

512
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,040
None of those consoles did I have in the first year.

513
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,260
And in some cases, I think a Super Nintendo was out for like three years before I got

514
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
one.

515
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,220
I have never owned a console on launch day.

516
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,260
See when you're, when you're the big kid and you get to make the purchases, then you get

517
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,220
to, you know, kind of make some more of those decisions.

518
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,100
So it's not that we don't support the next generation of gaming by not getting those

519
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
consoles right away.

520
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
We just get there eventually.

521
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,980
I just go, the realistic is, you know, now I've got to juggle the rest of the bills and

522
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,980
so on.

523
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,980
Anyway, Jamie, I know you're done.

524
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,380
Here's the other thing too, is that we have experience to back us up where we have been

525
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,840
there for system launches and we have gotten things close to launch window.

526
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,260
You know, I mean, Dan and I waited in line for our, um, our Dreamcast.

527
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,180
I waited in line for a Wii, you know, actually Kristen and I bribed our place in line.

528
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,660
In line at target with, with Krispy Kreme, um, you know, the other systems, Dan was able

529
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,740
to get day one because he managed a GameStop, you know, we've had the ends.

530
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:14,200
We took advantage of it, but now it's like we have that experience of the disappointment

531
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
that's come afterwards.

532
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Well, okay.

533
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,260
The, the Chinese weren't off Dan's done with, you know, Twilight princess.

534
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
What do we do now?

535
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:28,540
Um, I could sit here and try to play, uh, trauma center on Vicodin cause that was right

536
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,420
after my surgery too, you know, sorry, go ahead.

537
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,740
I'm just saying that a lot of the people that you see waiting in line now aren't people

538
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,700
who have more done, you know, maybe game launch weights or have had people to do the weight

539
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,300
for them, but now they're getting the experience of getting it home and then going, well, what

540
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,180
do I do now?

541
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,660
You know, what's really funny that I'm just now realizing, cause I'm thinking through

542
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,940
in my head, like, what did I buy on launch day and what did I buy in the launch window

543
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,260
and so forth?

544
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:04,660
And every system that I bought on launch day, every single one of them that I had on the

545
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,540
launch day that I actually said, you know what, I'm going to buy this purchase.

546
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,820
Do you, I bet you can guess, do you know what they all have in common?

547
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:18,780
No, uh, actually, actually, yes.

548
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
Compilations slash history.

549
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:27,020
No, no, they're all Nintendo, which isn't, which isn't going to do the, the people that

550
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,340
call me a fan boy and he, and that whole thing, any favors, but just real it, I'm going to

551
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
fess up.

552
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,860
I'm, I think that I bought a Wii U on launch day, I bought a Wii on launch day, I bought

553
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:41,020
a DS on launch day, I bought a 3DS on launch day, uh, I didn't buy a GameCube on launch.

554
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,580
I didn't know I didn't buy that, but you know, of, you know, of the games, the systems

555
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,620
I can think of that I actually did punk down the money on, um, on launch day, they were

556
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,140
all Nintendo.

557
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,820
And I'm trying to think in my head right now, like, well, why is that Rob?

558
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,820
Why did you buy those systems, but yet you wouldn't do it for the PlayStation four so

559
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
forth.

560
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,400
And again, it's about the games that were out and we, you had a Mario game I really

561
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,900
wanted to play and it had the zombie you and, and you know that the, we had Zelda, you know,

562
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,900
and amongst that was the big decider for me and so on and so on.

563
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,000
You know, and 3DS and DS were a little bit different granted, but you know, they were

564
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,780
strong enough where I bought one on launch day.

565
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,740
Did I buy a Vita on launch day?

566
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,660
I don't think I did, but I bought it really close.

567
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,420
So Vita was close.

568
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,980
Well Dan and Dan and I, um, before that, cause he had gotten his Saturn at launch and I think

569
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,580
he, yeah, Dan got his Saturn at launch and we got our Dreamcast at launch and we got

570
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,900
an import Dreamcast soon after Japanese launch.

571
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,220
Um, so we were like that with everything Sega did.

572
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,500
One thing I haven't brought up on the show in a while is that I kind of took a siesta

573
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
during that.

574
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,220
Like I wasn't like when I was in college, I actually, I was going through some other

575
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,500
stuff personally, so I actually wasn't as big of a gamer during that period.

576
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,020
So I kind of missed the, uh, the Dreamcast launch probably right on up to the PlayStation

577
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
two launch.

578
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,900
I think that finally started to bring me back in the fold thanks to DDR and everything.

579
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,180
And then I got into this show, which really got me back into video games again.

580
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,920
But uh, I kind of missed a gap there.

581
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,180
So, but I kind of feel like if I was gaming, I would have bought a Dreamcast on launch

582
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,180
day.

583
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,180
I have to tell you the truth.

584
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,420
That was actually one of the most fun launches I've attended.

585
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,420
No, I bet.

586
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
Loki, any thoughts?

587
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,180
Um, we kind of strayed a little bit from the original topic.

588
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,740
I'm sorry, but this is good stuff.

589
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,420
I would blame Jason for that.

590
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,420
My fault.

591
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Yeah.

592
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,220
Um, I bought, well, I didn't buy anything this generation will for launch stuff otherwise.

593
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:39,340
Um, but the PlayStation, Xbox 360 wasn't quite at launch because they were sold out.

594
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,900
And so I got one from Craigslist and so I got that near launch.

595
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,020
I mean, it was pretty close, but I bought like almost the entire library of launch games

596
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
when they came out.

597
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,820
So, I mean, and I was vastly disappointed by a lot of them because it was just like,

598
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,500
eh, it's not that great, but I don't know.

599
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,700
Assuming I can budget again, I will have a PlayStation for January, February next year

600
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,980
is when I'm looking to get my PlayStation for Xbox.

601
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,820
One will be like late summer, probably the holiday season console.

602
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,860
I'm just like, I don't even really, I still don't really need a PlayStation forward.

603
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,340
Like there's nothing upcoming.

604
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,340
Infamous looks good.

605
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,340
That's for me.

606
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
For me there is though.

607
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,540
And we'll get to it later in the show.

608
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:25,500
Well, I was also going to say there's some, uh, you know, some chatter in here about,

609
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,500
you know, different people having different systems at launch.

610
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,340
The other thing too, that made system launches different for me and Dan was that when the

611
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,820
last gen came out, he was managing a GameStop.

612
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,940
So it wasn't like we had to go and wait in line.

613
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,980
He could just go to the store and pick it up, you know, it'd be behind the desk.

614
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,900
We weren't going to, the only reason we waited in line for the Wii, I waited in line for

615
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,320
the Wii is because we weren't originally going to get one.

616
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,860
So we had no order on it.

617
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,580
And then we were trying to, you know, wait in line for OLR.

618
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
That was fun though.

619
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,580
It was kind of fun.

620
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,460
I had a good time hanging out with Kristen that night.

621
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,580
And then there were the people that were walking, no, he wasn't that one with us, but then there

622
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,060
were the people walking up at, you know, eight in the morning right here to buy one.

623
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
Sorry.

624
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,580
We only have enough for the people who were in line.

625
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Anyhow.

626
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,580
All right.

627
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,500
Uh, good reminiscing, good stories.

628
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,700
We got a little bit off topic though.

629
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,180
I want to get into our gaming weeks so we can get into what's going on in gaming news

630
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
this week.

631
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,260
Uh, so let's get into how was your gaming week, the types of video games that you have

632
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,700
been playing this week, whatever system it's on, uh, or PC, uh, dark Sakura.

633
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,020
I played some final fantasy, uh, 14.

634
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:41,140
Um, I thought about eight and then I went, lol, no, um, we, uh, what else did I play?

635
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:46,340
I actually started playing Mass Effect 2 again, just because I wanted more stuff to caption.

636
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,980
Um, what is it?

637
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,980
Oh yeah.

638
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Animal crossing.

639
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
I'm still playing Zelda.

640
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,860
I'm taking my sweet time with it.

641
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,260
Um, I, I think I'm five songs away from having a complete song list in animal crossing now.

642
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
Nice.

643
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
Yeah.

644
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,220
Um, we, uh, crap, what else was it that I played?

645
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
Oh yeah.

646
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,460
I tried to play bust to move universe again and it's just awful.

647
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
I tried to like it.

648
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,380
It's, it just was not good.

649
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,700
It's clearly the reason it was $14 brand new.

650
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,580
It's just hard to see.

651
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,220
And then, um, I, uh, yeah, I think that's about it.

652
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,660
I kept going back and, uh, checking the, uh, roster list for Namco High cause I'm really

653
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,300
looking forward to playing it.

654
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
All right.

655
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,620
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

656
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,300
Um, this week I played more Grand Theft Auto.

657
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,900
Um, did a little bit more online on the 360.

658
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,420
Got my character up to, I think, level 20, which is weird.

659
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,700
See, it kind of sucks that they've nerfed everything cause it, it's taken me so much

660
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,260
longer to get up to like level 20 on the Xbox 360 than it has on PlayStation 3 where

661
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,260
I was playing it a lot more.

662
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,620
And like on PlayStation 3, I think I'm up to like 28 or 30 or something.

663
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:04,340
Um, so it's kind of hard to get them all high level, especially when I split my time between

664
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,380
two different versions of the game.

665
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,380
Um, let's see.

666
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,080
Other things I played, I played a little Minecraft, um, this week just when I didn't have any

667
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,580
internet, um, at work and stuff.

668
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:22,420
And it's as grindy and, I don't know, as it's been, so.

669
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,980
But there's horses and, uh, I haven't really done anything with the horses.

670
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,340
They just taunt me from outside the window.

671
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:35,060
Um, and then I did, uh, as I was, uh, kind of hyping up last week, I did get to play

672
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:41,440
some of the, um, final beta tests for Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

673
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
It's fantastic.

674
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,120
I mean, the game is pretty old, but, um, I was gonna say, we're on Just Cause 3 at this

675
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
point, aren't we?

676
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,360
No, they haven't put out number three yet.

677
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
Oh, I thought we were.

678
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,040
No, that's, uh, hopefully gonna be worked on, but clearly it's a series I've overlooked

679
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
a bit.

680
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Sorry.

681
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Yeah, like Rent There's Auto.

682
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:04,080
Um, I would say though, it's pretty amazing what they've done with this game.

683
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,560
They, they have a game that was a single player game and they turned it into almost like an

684
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
MMO.

685
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,200
There were, there are literally hundreds of people online at a time.

686
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,400
Um, I think the lowest I saw it was about 800 people in one game on one server, 800

687
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
people.

688
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,200
And then the most was like 1400 people on one server, all playing together at the same

689
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
time.

690
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,760
Yeah, granted there was a few lag issues here and there, but it wasn't super terrible.

691
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,160
Um, the only thing it's like, I haven't played Just Cause 2 in a long time, so, you know,

692
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,340
the weapons are kind of limited and, you know, there's not a whole ton of vehicles,

693
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,760
but you can like buy your own weapons in game.

694
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,160
You kill people and you get money and you, or you can do races and get money that way.

695
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:54,080
Um, you know, you can jump to different places like teleport or you can, um, you know, join

696
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,080
races and you know, literally it'll just teleport you once you have enough people for a race

697
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,280
and you do the race and you earn money and you can buy vehicles, weapons, different player

698
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,920
skins and it's just, it's amazing what they've done.

699
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,920
And they even had at one point a thing, although it was disabled the last time I played this

700
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,200
afternoon, but they had a thing to boost your vehicle speed.

701
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,400
So you can type in, you know, slash boost and then set it from, you know, 0.5 or you

702
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,640
know, 1.0 boost up to 20.

703
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,400
And so if like you hit the gas and hit the boost, you can like launch.

704
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,080
I was flying in a, in a boat because I hit a wave or something like that and I was just

705
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,200
like, I went into the sky and it wasn't coming down.

706
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,440
But I mean, it's awesome because not only, you know, are you, you know, flying around

707
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,000
that stuff, but just cause you have like this grappling hook so you can, you know, grapple

708
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,080
onto things and planes and it's just fun and the game is super cheap.

709
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,840
So seriously, if they're launching the full version of the game later on this month, we'll

710
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,960
talk about that a little later, but the game itself is like two bucks.

711
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
It's like three bucks.

712
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,720
I think it's $2.99 on Steam.

713
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,480
Pick that game up and then definitely if you can pick up the multiplayer mod, hopefully

714
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,760
it's not going to be, I don't think it's gonna be that expensive, but you know, if

715
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,020
it's running pretty decent as it is with 1400 people with one server, when they open that

716
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,660
up and have a lot more servers, it's going to be pretty amazing.

717
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,560
So and I mean, I had, you know, the frame rate dropped a little bit when you have like

718
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,200
hundreds of people in one spot, but it wasn't too bad.

719
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,840
It was playable and it was a lot of fun.

720
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,000
I definitely gave me quite a big grin.

721
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Neo Planet.

722
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
A lot of fun.

723
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,080
Since I can't kill anybody in Grand Theft Auto Online without being penalized for it,

724
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,600
which is kind of lame, but this game, kill, kill, kill, kill, you know, crash things into

725
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,080
each other and it's all sorts of chaos.

726
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,000
All right.

727
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,240
Uh, busy, busy with you then, uh, with, uh, Just Cause multiplayer and, uh, is there like

728
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,000
a, is there a faction or some way that all the VoG people can play with you or, um, well,

729
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,320
not right now because it's just a beta test, but you can create your own factions and join

730
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,400
up and stuff like that.

731
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,640
So that might be something we can do later on, especially because right now I would be

732
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,040
pretty hard to like stay together because it's a huge map and you kind of spawn into

733
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,280
random locations.

734
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,120
You can teleport to different places, but you know, it could, it's very easy to lose

735
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,760
each other in that game.

736
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
It was funny though.

737
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,400
There was one guy like I had jumped onto his boat and he drove off and so I stayed on his

738
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,760
hood for a while and then he kind of followed me around for a while.

739
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,720
And then like, you know, later on I was playing through and I passed by him, you know, parachuting

740
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
and stuff.

741
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,280
So I don't know, it'll be fun once, uh, once they launch it officially.

742
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
All right.

743
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,320
Uh, Jason, do you have something you want to share this week?

744
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:50,040
I I'm sure this came up when it actually came out, but have we like actually talked about

745
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:57,640
the, uh, the Miiverse 3DS, uh, the, the, the DLC for lack of a better word for bonus games?

746
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,760
Not really in depth.

747
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
So go for it.

748
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,720
I actually, it occurred to me this week when I was like really drawing out my ability to

749
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
play those.

750
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,640
Um, it's actually, those games are insane amounts of fun, but the problem is like Street

751
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,160
Pass, they rely on you passing people to actually generate it.

752
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,240
Um, I may have mentioned on the show sometime before that I have a router at home that takes

753
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,680
advantage of Nintendo's remote Street Pass feature where somebody will, somebody's data,

754
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,720
Nintendo will save somebody's Mi data at a hotspot.

755
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,400
And then when you go to that hotspot, you get their Mi data, your Mi goes in place.

756
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,560
And so you can actually start to proliferate at least a little bit more in the community.

757
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,720
And they're supposed to be doing something like, uh, a Starbucks, a McDonald's in Europe

758
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,120
and a McDonald's in America at the same time, we'll swap data across regions, that kind

759
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
of stuff.

760
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,440
So I have a router that masquerades that and I get, you know, for, for Miiverse, I get,

761
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:03,160
uh, 10 Mi's in not even 10 minutes and it, it really makes those games shine.

762
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,080
And especially like Mi Force, just how in depth it really is.

763
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:19,160
Um, I always forget the name of the, the, uh, Ninja, um, I can, yeah, I can never remember

764
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,120
the fourth game, but just a rock, paper, scissors.

765
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,120
Yeah.

766
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,880
It's lit that, that is, I thought I would like that game the most, but it is literally

767
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,600
just a grind fest for, for troops, um, rock, paper, scissors.

768
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Yeah, whatever.

769
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,320
Monster Manor, uh, uh, Flower, wow.

770
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,320
I'm forgetting all of these.

771
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
Aren't I?

772
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
The Flower.

773
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
Yeah.

774
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,120
The Warriors way with the rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors.

775
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Thank you.

776
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
And then Mi Force.

777
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,080
The other three are insane amounts of fun and I did not expect them to be.

778
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,660
So I have actually been really nursing those games this week because it takes me like two

779
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,880
to three weeks in San Francisco to be able to pick up 10 Mi's, which kind of surprises

780
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
me.

781
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
Um.

782
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
Tiger Claw is very curious.

783
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
How do you set up a router to do that?

784
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,560
Does it have to be a specific brand or model?

785
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,160
It does because you have to be able to change the router's Mac address.

786
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:16,660
Um, because that's the, uh, the 3DS has to communicate to the internet and Nintendo themselves

787
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,760
stores Mi data and a Mac address.

788
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,240
So the Mac address, uh, there's a, there's a community, basically a homebrew community

789
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,880
that revolves around this.

790
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,920
Um, I can send you a ton of links, um, and I will do that shortly.

791
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,280
I think the router I bought was like 40 bucks and there's plenty of alternatives, uh, around

792
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
as well.

793
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,040
So as I predicted I was going to do this week, as far as having time to sit down and game,

794
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,200
that did not happen.

795
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,240
I was training a new hire this week, which means my time was, you know, split between

796
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,160
my own daily duties as well as getting him up to speed.

797
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,560
And then all the fun things of dinner at work and all that kind of stuff, which meant that

798
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,840
I got back to the place that I'm staying at like 11 o'clock or midnight every single

799
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
night.

800
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
But you've been working on something for a while.

801
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,640
I have in the time that I did manage to have and then finished off on Saturday because

802
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,440
everything lightened up yesterday.

803
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,460
I actually sat down and at, um, I want to say it was dark touch Tetsuya's suggestion,

804
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,800
but I don't recall who actually said it last week.

805
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,480
Somebody said in chat that it's great that we're putting this on YouTube as well, but

806
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,040
can you take some advantage of visual content, ie classic game of the week?

807
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,840
I sat that I was like, that's a great idea and it's totally doable.

808
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,720
So I took the show, I took, uh, I got some of the resources from what Rob has done on

809
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,280
the previous episode.

810
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,800
And I, I wanted to do, I have a lot more ideas.

811
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,200
I just didn't have the time to do with this.

812
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
You're just dipping your big toe in.

813
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
So I was like, you know, okay.

814
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Yay.

815
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Yay.

816
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,200
You got the classic game.

817
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
Plus learning video editing and everything else.

818
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
That's the first.

819
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,840
I took the video that Rob was playing in studio for marble madness while Jamie was talking

820
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
about it.

821
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:02,120
And I spliced it into the video stream after the fact based off the audio that was going

822
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:08,000
on, it was time consuming as all hell and frustrating at times, but I'm really, really

823
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,440
pleased with how it came out.

824
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,240
It's the only inner content of the video, but there is more in store.

825
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,240
All right.

826
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,560
Well, thank you for volunteering to take over the YouTube channel.

827
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Essentially.

828
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
It's going to be great.

829
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,520
We've gotten a little, a little bit of feedback on YouTube, and I think people looking forward

830
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,400
to seeing, you know, what we can do there and who knows, you know, I know I've said

831
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,400
my piece about, I don't know if talking heads during the show is the most interesting thing

832
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
in the world.

833
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,880
I know I've said my piece on that, but who knows?

834
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,320
I might, I might be swayed in 2014 things are a Bruin, you know, and if we can't think

835
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,600
of anything, we can just always fill the rest of the video full of YTMD strobing, you know,

836
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,120
the whole works for me, works for me.

837
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,600
Bobby Black Wolf, our, uh, our, uh, guy that's on before us here at, uh, the voice keys network.

838
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,400
He says in chat, I'm a little jealous.

839
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,960
So LR gets all these people to do things for them.

840
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,560
Oh, Bobby.

841
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:06,480
I've if it's any consolation, it took me a decade to realize that I can contribute.

842
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
So now I am.

843
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Well, thank you.

844
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,480
We appreciate it.

845
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,480
Really do.

846
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
All right.

847
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,640
Uh, anyhow, let's, uh, talk about my gaming week.

848
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,240
I actually don't have a whole lot to share with my gaming week.

849
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,280
Um, Oh gosh, what could I talk about?

850
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,480
Well, you know, I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14, like a true addict.

851
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,840
Uh, luckily I'm not the only podcaster addicted to this stuff just before tonight's show.

852
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,080
I was helping my buddy, uh, who's one of the hosts on Koopa club.

853
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,080
I was helping him.

854
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,360
Uh, Jonko was one of the hosts over there and I was helping him with some of the things

855
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,880
you have to do when you're level 50, uh, like the primal battles and so forth.

856
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,480
I will say this as far as Final Fantasy 14 goes, cause it's not in the show world tonight.

857
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:47,200
Uh, there was a new trailer for the patch, uh, the patch 2.1 that hits Monday after next.

858
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,160
Uh, there's a new trailer that was out this week for that 10 minute trailer cause it shows

859
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,880
like a little bit of all the stuff that's new.

860
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,960
There's a lot of, and it kind of needs it as much as I love Final Fantasy 14, the end

861
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,680
game content's pretty thin.

862
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,920
So they're really beefing that up with this new patch.

863
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,920
That's very exciting.

864
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,020
So happy to see it.

865
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,680
Did you finish your lightning quests?

866
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,720
No, I failed on that.

867
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,000
I accidentally did them.

868
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,960
I did the first one and I slacked off on the others.

869
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,260
So I actually have a few screens of what lightning looks like in game.

870
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,280
The good news is if you didn't do the lightning quest, they will be back in February when

871
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,520
lightning returns comes out in the US.

872
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,040
So there you'll, you'll get a second shot to do those and there'll probably be more

873
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,200
people that are new to the game and so forth at that point.

874
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,480
Uh, so I've been playing an awful lot of that randomly this week.

875
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,600
I'll talk about a random game I played this week.

876
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,440
Um, so you know how there was that WB bundle that was on sale a few weeks ago and I've

877
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,820
had the key in steam.

878
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,340
So I was like, the other night, you know, I had, I didn't want to play MMOs cause I'm

879
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,840
like, all right, I've hit my limit on MMOs.

880
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,940
I need to play something else to, to just, you know, cleanse the pallet a little bit

881
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,260
and do something else in games.

882
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:53,060
I played Batman Arkham Asylum, like I partied like it was what, 2009 or whenever that game

883
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,180
came out.

884
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:59,000
But uh, that's, it was neat because I, I, it was the first time I played it on PC versus

885
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,880
a console and it runs really nice on my PC with the really crisp graphics and I could

886
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,420
just use an Xbox 360 controller.

887
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,180
So it's just like playing on console.

888
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:13,060
And it was great to go back and experience that again and it's that game and, and um,

889
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,260
you know, Arkham city and I haven't played the new one yet, but I know those first two

890
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,540
at least are so well put together.

891
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,740
Like they're, they're, they do such justice to the Batman comics.

892
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,540
I think, I mean, I know not everybody may agree, but you know, if you're more of a fan

893
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,600
of like the animated series and the comics and all that, any of those games do it so

894
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
well.

895
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,160
And uh, Mark Hamill does a great joker of course in the, I know he wasn't in the most

896
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,020
recent one, but in the earlier ones.

897
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:39,900
I watched Dan play through the, the, the other two and they're great games.

898
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,820
I mean, yeah, especially though I love all the Catwoman stuff in, um, Arkham, in Arkham

899
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,820
city.

900
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,820
That's great.

901
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,820
Yeah.

902
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,200
So, uh, and yeah, I need to play, I also have Arkham city on steam, so I'll play that at

903
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,780
some point, but, uh, I want to get through Arkham asylum first, even though it might

904
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,540
take me a little while and you got to tear me away from Final Fantasy 14 to do so.

905
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,980
Um, and then I've just been slowly making progress in other games.

906
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,600
Uh, new Mario, new Zelda, I haven't been playing those as much as I was when I first

907
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,600
got them, but I don't, I mean, there's no games left to buy at this point.

908
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,820
So the good news is, you know, through the holidays, I'll be able to make progress on

909
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,020
some of these games I fell behind in.

910
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,220
I think that's what a lot of you have planned.

911
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,220
Eh?

912
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,220
All right.

913
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,220
Eh?

914
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,220
Eh?

915
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,220
Don't know.

916
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,220
All right.

917
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,220
Uh, housekeeping.

918
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,220
Uh, you of course can friend the show at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and you can follow

919
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,860
us on Twitter.

920
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,860
Don't friend our butts.

921
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,980
Twitter.com slash O L R. Some people aren't going to get that joke, dark saga.

922
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:39,020
She's, she's referencing an old ass joke here on O L R. Um, what else is it going to say?

923
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,140
Uh, we are on YouTube now as well.

924
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,700
Uh, youtube.com slash orange launch radio.

925
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,920
Thank you, Jason, very much for taking the time to put that all together.

926
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,300
Don't bust your ass being a perfectionist on that because that's killed me so many times,

927
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,700
but do it 99% and you're good.

928
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,580
In my defense I did because I didn't, the, the, the video played essentially three and

929
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:09,180
a half times and I know the second time was out of sync, but I'm going to fuck that up

930
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,180
so bad.

931
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,180
Jason.

932
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,180
So don't get used to that.

933
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,180
It'll happen.

934
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,180
All right.

935
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,700
Uh, but we're, we're dying for more youtube comments on what you guys would like to see

936
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,940
over there outside of cameras in the studio.

937
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,180
We know you all want that.

938
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,180
We'll see.

939
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:29,100
Um, let's see, uh, as far as the schedule for the show goes, I don't see us taking any

940
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,420
shows off between now.

941
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,680
I mean the way Christmas and new year's are this year, I think we're going to have shows

942
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,300
right on through the new year, a schedule subject to change though.

943
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,740
Loki will not be here next week though.

944
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,140
Unfortunately, at least we don't think he's going to be.

945
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,340
Loki would you like to tell listeners why you're not going to be here next week?

946
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,580
I'm not going to be here next week cause on Thursday I have to get my wisdom teeth out.

947
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,580
Good times.

948
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,540
We are dying for Loki videos on, on the,

949
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,540
I will try.

950
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,820
I'm not going to have anything to do.

951
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,840
So you know, I'm just going to be sitting at home.

952
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,180
So Nellie, uh, she, she said she's gone through it.

953
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,260
I think, Hey, I don't know if she's gone through it, but I think people have gone through it

954
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,500
and they say, when you get out of general anesthesia, you're just very tired.

955
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,500
So who knows?

956
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,740
I may be sleeping.

957
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,560
I was confused.

958
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,420
I was talking about my ex boyfriend with my mother.

959
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,900
Like I will never have anesthesia again after that.

960
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,340
What was I thinking?

961
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,340
I don't know.

962
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,340
Well, let's see.

963
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,900
We'll see what we talk, what I talk about.

964
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:28,780
But um, I told her that I think she should record me like, you know, David after Dennis

965
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,780
thing.

966
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,780
Oh, we could just totally do that.

967
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,260
I think you should play Grand Theft Auto while you're on the anesthesia.

968
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,260
I probably will do.

969
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,260
Oh, while I'm on the anesthesia.

970
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,260
Yeah.

971
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,860
That, that would be a hilarious view.

972
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,140
Playing Grand Theft Auto while I'm on anesthesia.

973
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,140
I'm asleep.

974
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,140
Nothing's happening.

975
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:49,100
I'm just going to let it play and just sit there for 15 minutes.

976
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,660
No.

977
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,020
Um, so yeah, I'm not looking forward to that cause I've never been put under and uh, never

978
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,420
had an IV.

979
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,940
All these firsts that I really don't want to have to do.

980
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,220
Brad, uh, our buddy from pod culture here at the boys and geeks network says, wuss,

981
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,220
get your butt to the show.

982
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,220
Been there, done that.

983
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,300
I had a hand sandwich two hours after mine were out.

984
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,300
No, exactly.

985
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,740
I, Hey, I'm totally with you.

986
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,620
You know, I, I, I'm like ready to go back to work the next day, but you know, my wife's

987
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,620
like, oh, wait, you're not gonna be able to eat anything.

988
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,620
You're not really going to have to work.

989
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,580
Dude, he said I could eat something right after, you know, my job becomes a numb because

990
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,660
they don't want you to bite through your, you know, cheek or something like that.

991
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,660
I just hope you don't run into the same thing that I did was that, well, the bottom holes

992
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:33,100
didn't fill up for three months and I looked like I'd been in a prize fight for the entire

993
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,100
time.

994
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,100
Cool.

995
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,100
Then I'm going to totally say I'm in a price fight.

996
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,540
I also couldn't talk for the, those three months because I was talking to you cause

997
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,540
you're moving me my jaw.

998
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,580
You know, I got to say, I think SSG 100 Matt is absolutely right in the chat room and I

999
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,260
believe his dad's a dentist if I remember right, he says wisdom teeth recovery is different

1000
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,260
for each person.

1001
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,500
I was able to eat fine a day or two after and yeah, I think it just depends on each

1002
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
person.

1003
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Yeah.

1004
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,860
So don't, don't neglect the saline wash thing they tell you about.

1005
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,860
That's super important.

1006
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,540
Well, they're suturing them up, so I don't think it's going to be anything that I'm going

1007
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,100
to need to, I didn't have to do a saline wash either.

1008
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,860
I don't think I'm not going to be able to wash anything if it's sutured up.

1009
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,860
Okay.

1010
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,380
I seem to remember something about you have to do so that you don't want to get dry socket.

1011
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,380
No.

1012
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,540
So what I had to do was this, um, actually they gave me like a natural treatment to strengthen

1013
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,140
the gums and then I didn't have to do any type of rinses or anything afterwards, but

1014
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,140
I had my wisdom teeth out.

1015
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,180
I guess I went to the back alley, Dennis.

1016
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,900
Well, I had mine out though in the two thousands, you know?

1017
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,500
Well, you know, my wife's like, you know, you can't eat anything afterwards cause what

1018
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,980
if you get like something in there?

1019
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,260
I'm like, that's okay.

1020
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,260
If I eat meat.

1021
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,260
You can have a milkshake.

1022
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,780
If I, if I, well I'm going to have smoothies.

1023
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:42,020
If I can, uh, you know, if I can just eat meat, I'll just shove meat in there cause you know,

1024
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,020
flesh and flesh.

1025
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,020
It works.

1026
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,020
Have a meat milkshake.

1027
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,020
A meat shake.

1028
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,780
That's not as good as you think it is.

1029
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,260
Does your meat shake bring all the boys to the yard?

1030
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,660
Uh, does Jack in the box still do the bacon milkshake?

1031
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,660
You could do that.

1032
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,660
Oh God.

1033
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,660
That was just, that wasn't very good.

1034
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,660
That was pretty disgusting.

1035
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,660
It just seems like smokey vanilla.

1036
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,440
I agree with, I agree with Akuma JP, OLR, dentist edition.

1037
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,420
We're going way too far down the dentist line.

1038
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:06,020
Let's get into, uh, gaming news and what's going on in the video game world.

1039
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,060
Even though it is the holidays, things are slowing down a little bit.

1040
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,220
There's still some things to point out from the week.

1041
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,220
Quite a bit actually.

1042
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,220
Sorry, Scott.

1043
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,700
I'm trying, I'm actually going to be on laughing gas is going to be actually, uh, I'm pretty

1044
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,820
sure it's an Ivy.

1045
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,220
That's too bad cause I think it would be hilarious.

1046
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,780
I was on both.

1047
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,740
I don't think they're going to put me on both cause they did give me a, was it a, they needed

1048
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,380
both to knock out your soul.

1049
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,380
Dark soccer.

1050
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:36,100
The whole, the whole reason, you know what, this is true, but the whole, the whole reason

1051
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,180
is because, um, it actually dilates your blood vessels.

1052
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,900
They gave me something, they couldn't get the IV in.

1053
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,100
They gave me something to take the edge off before I go there.

1054
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,100
I don't remember what it is.

1055
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:52,180
So some sort of drug that could you take the edge off the show by doing some gaming news?

1056
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,140
So Sony has reset some PlayStation network passwords.

1057
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:01,460
Um, they said that there was some irregular activity and apparently, you know, they, they

1058
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:06,460
came out, try not to, you know, alarm anyone, you know, re routinely monitor for a regular

1059
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,860
activity and if such activity is detected, we may sometimes reset passwords of affected

1060
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:16,660
SCN accounts to protect consumers and their account information.

1061
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:22,260
The password resets are not related to an attack nor vulnerability in our data servers.

1062
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,660
It is an example of an increasingly common threat of malicious online activity.

1063
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:31,660
Although I'd like to follow that up with, didn't I just read not too long ago that there

1064
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,540
was some people being affected by the same type of shit that we saw with, you know, the

1065
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:41,900
FIFA hacking now on the PlayStation 4 and maybe it's something to do with that.

1066
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,460
But maybe I'm also, you know, being too conspiracy furious.

1067
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:52,180
No, and I have some serious concerns about this story because when I turned on my PlayStation

1068
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,460
3 earlier this week, it made me reset my password.

1069
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,180
So I'm one of the people that had to do it.

1070
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,380
And so there was a part of me that's like, why?

1071
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,180
Why am I being picked?

1072
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,740
Because there shouldn't be any irregularities on my account.

1073
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:10,300
I only use my PlayStation 3 and the Vita once in a great while.

1074
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,060
Why am I having to reset my password?

1075
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:16,260
Which is, you know, it's kind of, I mean, changing your password is good and so forth,

1076
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,020
but it's like, okay, now I really have to have unique passwords.

1077
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,980
If it's in a constellation, they only hacked celebrities.

1078
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,980
Okay.

1079
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,980
Yeah.

1080
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,820
But that's my problem is that I'm like, wait a minute.

1081
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:30,660
Does that mean I was one of those people that they saw vulnerability for from the two

1082
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,020
million other hack thing?

1083
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,460
And I'm like, son of a bitch.

1084
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,460
Like, am I at risk?

1085
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,980
Like, it has me a little concerned.

1086
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:44,460
So this is actually on the heels of a similar tech story about three or four weeks ago.

1087
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:48,780
The chief one was the start of September with the big Adobe hack.

1088
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:54,980
There were between that and then there are other miscellaneous news about, not that Twitter

1089
00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:01,060
and Facebook were hacked, but I saw something from them earlier this week.

1090
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:07,180
LinkedIn and Adobe's password theft were like the big ones a couple months ago.

1091
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:11,980
And this trend that's emerged from these really prominent companies is that they will get

1092
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,900
that exported data.

1093
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:20,100
And if your password, if your email address shows up, they'll warn you if your password

1094
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,500
matches the same password hash, because any company in their right mind does not store

1095
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,020
plain text passwords.

1096
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,020
Unfortunately, some do.

1097
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,020
These don't.

1098
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:33,340
If your password matches a leaked hash, they reset your password because they force you

1099
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,340
to.

1100
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:39,180
You might've hit the nail on the head because I, I use unique passwords everywhere.

1101
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,740
But you probably use the same email address.

1102
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,660
But I use the same email address as PlayStation network.

1103
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,460
I had an Adobe account on there.

1104
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,800
That could be it.

1105
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,800
You might be right.

1106
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,620
And I feel a little better knowing that even, even with, even with hash passwords that I

1107
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,340
could, to the extent that I actually have this knowledge, I could delve into the quick,

1108
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,020
the quick overview is that remember, I'm a corporate trainer.

1109
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,020
There's Adobe.

1110
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,020
There's an Adobe stuff.

1111
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,020
Here's the thing.

1112
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,900
Then why didn't they just say, Hey, we saw that, you know, Adobe has been hacked near

1113
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,140
these people have been hacked.

1114
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:12,620
We ran a list, you know, comparing, you know, the emails that were affected, um, from those

1115
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,620
sites.

1116
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,900
And as a precautionary measure, we went ahead and reset the passwords.

1117
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,700
I think of it a little bit more explanation.

1118
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:22,340
If that's the case, that would, it would actually be better in their favor because they would

1119
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,860
be, Oh, they're very proactive about that.

1120
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,940
Code man in chat says I had to reset my PSN password too.

1121
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,960
I bet code man's an Adobe user.

1122
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,960
He does all that.

1123
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,720
I know he does stuff with video and graphic design.

1124
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,720
That's weird.

1125
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,780
I'm an Adobe user too, but I didn't have to reset my password.

1126
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,900
Oh, that's because I don't, well, I never got it.

1127
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,820
Did you use different emails though?

1128
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,700
I don't know if I give them, did you subscribe to their live services?

1129
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,700
You probably didn't.

1130
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,700
Yeah.

1131
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,580
See, that's, I never got anything to reset my Adobe passwords though.

1132
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:53,300
Did you ever use like, um, I, the name escapes me all of a sudden of the screencast or whatever

1133
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:59,220
it is that they use or just any of their online services, acrobat online or I've got the creative

1134
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,900
cloud because we was given the account for creative cloud for a year.

1135
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,540
See Allen chat room says tinfoil hat radio.

1136
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,420
I'm looking for a trend.

1137
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,420
Okay.

1138
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,180
Shane Alinko says I don't use Adobe, but I had to reset mine.

1139
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,180
All right.

1140
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,180
So y'all just blew a hole in my theory.

1141
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,180
Do you use LinkedIn?

1142
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,180
Oh yeah.

1143
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,180
Oh yeah.

1144
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,420
Maybe, maybe he did though.

1145
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,420
Hmm.

1146
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,420
No.

1147
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,180
If Shane uses LinkedIn, then he's not on my profile.

1148
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,140
I usually know why he's not my friend on LinkedIn with my work email.

1149
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:34,340
So I don't ever, there's, there are many different sources of these things happening.

1150
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:40,100
And even when the, the, the, the extracted information and breach is released, sometimes

1151
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:47,420
it's not all of the information again, if, if, if they just go off password hashes, which

1152
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:52,740
are not necessarily a perfect way of doing things, but if data doesn't match, your record

1153
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,740
doesn't show up.

1154
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,740
You don't have to change it.

1155
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,260
There is no one answer for everything.

1156
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:01,060
This is the continuing saga of security exploits vulnerabilities.

1157
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,060
It happens.

1158
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,640
It continues on whatever it happened.

1159
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,060
As long as you take your precautions to stay safe, we don't have a problem here.

1160
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:11,820
Use distinct passwords, enable two factor authentication if the service supports it,

1161
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,820
be safe out there.

1162
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,380
It sucks sometimes.

1163
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,380
And then it's awesome.

1164
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,380
Like this show.

1165
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,380
Uh, yeah.

1166
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,380
That's okay.

1167
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,580
We're talking about drugs and chat.

1168
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:25,700
Uh, also I don't, I don't want to, I want to really kind of just make sure I poke something

1169
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,900
with a sharp stick here.

1170
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,580
What Loki said about the whole FIFA hacks happening again on Sony, I just want to make

1171
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:35,300
sure I call that out because that's a great concern to me.

1172
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,420
And now I seem to remember when this, now my memory could be going here.

1173
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:45,380
I seem to remember EA through this on Microsoft big time when that happened, EA pushback and

1174
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,180
in land of Microsoft and I was one of those people that got hacked on Microsoft and so

1175
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,180
forth.

1176
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,180
And I said, you know what?

1177
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,460
No, there's a connection here.

1178
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,100
They created an EA account for me to buy all these.

1179
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:01,140
There's something going on on EA side that they're not fessing up to.

1180
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:06,020
And if this is, if this happened again, now it's through Sony.

1181
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,460
I think EA, you got some explaining to do.

1182
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,340
Didn't we, this, my, my brain could just be linking this in a strange way, but didn't

1183
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:18,900
we basically narrow it down to, uh, that kind of stuff happening because of Amazon's

1184
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:25,820
lax customer support, like, like Amazon, reverse social engineering on Microsoft, not Amazon,

1185
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:30,380
and like using, using other profile details, uh, other credit card information or an email

1186
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,380
address destination.

1187
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,580
They're like, my, my brain has like seven companies in mind.

1188
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,980
It's trying to remember the loop of the details and it's been a long time.

1189
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,700
I think it's an explanation.

1190
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,240
I'm not totally convinced it's the right one, especially now that we have this other thing

1191
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,240
going on here.

1192
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:50,960
And I kind of need EA to be very clear here on why it's not them and some, some very specific

1193
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,800
about what they're doing with data and how they're keeping it safe.

1194
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,440
I'm just saying that as a consumer, I mean, you might be a tech person sitting there going,

1195
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,480
Rob, there's no way that I just, as a consumer right now, I don't trust that this isn't happening

1196
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,200
because of something on EA side.

1197
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:09,640
I mean, it's, it's just too weird of a coincidence that it happened on Microsoft through an EA

1198
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:14,200
game and now it's happening through Sony on an EA game.

1199
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,960
That's that Scott of Tron and chat says, yeah, like EA would fess up to anything.

1200
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,160
Well, then we'll have to see how much we want to support them and give them information

1201
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,360
and money further on.

1202
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:31,320
But anyhow, here's something, uh, that I'm sure a lot of you will be spending money on.

1203
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,920
It was something that was announced during the, uh, VGX, uh, award show.

1204
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,040
One of the, one of the few highlights out of the show, uh, telltale announced that they

1205
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:44,020
are working on a game tales from the borderlands.

1206
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:49,040
So of course telltale did the, the speaking of video game award shows, they, they won

1207
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,240
them all for walking dead last year.

1208
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,080
Now tons of people want to work with them.

1209
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,840
So gearbox software, one of the people is working with telltale on this.

1210
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,680
So it's a game in the borderlands universe.

1211
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,440
It will be an episodic series.

1212
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,760
The storyline is defined by player choices.

1213
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:08,200
Um, gearbox will be providing borderlands assets telltale, however, is the ones that

1214
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,720
are, uh, designing the game.

1215
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,320
Telltale did make new characters for this game.

1216
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:19,320
They are saying they are not quite vault hunters, uh, and some of the characters seen in it,

1217
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,400
possibly handsome Jack, uh, although it's more of a resemblance in the trailer, part

1218
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,200
of me kind of wonders, could it be like a prequel or something?

1219
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,360
I think it's supposed to be during the same time as borderlands two or before.

1220
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,360
So we'll see.

1221
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,400
Uh, that wasn't the only thing telltale had to announce.

1222
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,280
They, uh, announced quite a bit because they also announced that they're working on a game

1223
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,760
of thrones game.

1224
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:46,440
Uh, so yeah, and I think isn't, do we already have some, they already kind of, that came

1225
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,240
out I think last week or earlier this week, but they did say it's based on the HBO series,

1226
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,240
not the books.

1227
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,240
Um, cool.

1228
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,280
So that's, you know, cause I think they've kind of gone different directions at this

1229
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,280
point.

1230
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,200
So it will be based off the HBO series and it is now official.

1231
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,680
So, uh, there you go.

1232
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,400
So a telltale clearly very busy.

1233
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,340
Uh, one thing I noticed that there wasn't a lot that people have been talking about

1234
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,340
this year.

1235
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:12,560
Telltale kind of didn't have a lot this year, although chat pointed out to me before the

1236
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:17,440
show, um, the, the wolves among us or something was a game that came out this year, but that

1237
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,660
didn't, that didn't get quite the chatter that some of their other releases have.

1238
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:27,320
So, um, you know, I'm wondering if there will be more in 2014, although I think walking

1239
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,360
dead episode or season two is supposed to be like really soon.

1240
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:35,000
Uh, some are saying it might be later this month, although it seems like a really weird

1241
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,360
time to release next year, probably early next year, but you never know.

1242
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,740
I mean, you know, telltale could recognize that they do a bulk of their business through

1243
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,080
digital distribution and they could release whenever.

1244
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,480
And you know, what a great thing to pick up on these gaming consoles right away.

1245
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,480
Who knows?

1246
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,480
Who knows?

1247
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,480
So, all right.

1248
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,120
Uh, moving on dark soccer.

1249
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:00,200
Well, you know, we've had a lot of, uh, joy over a particular gaming franchise and that's

1250
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Tomb Raider.

1251
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,080
Well, the definitive edition is coming out for PS4 and Xbone.

1252
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,560
I mean, Xbox one.

1253
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:14,940
Um, it's supposed to be out on January 28th in the US and in Europe on January 31st.

1254
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,680
And it was announced on the games Tumblr.

1255
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,560
I'm glad to see Tumblr getting more love.

1256
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:26,120
So you get all of the pre-order, um, bonuses, the, the Tomb of the Lost Adventurer and the

1257
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:32,040
multiplayer add-ons, uh, eight DLC maps, uh, six weapons and four characters.

1258
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:37,840
You also get extra Lara outfits and, um, digital copies of the, uh, Tomb Raider, the beginning

1259
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,200
and the art, the art book.

1260
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,760
So lots of stuff.

1261
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,880
Also the final hours of Tomb Raider will be included as well.

1262
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,080
The Xbox one version will have, uh, connect voice controls for weapon modding and menus.

1263
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,240
Um, and that's, I don't care.

1264
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,480
So there's, there's a part of me that wants to razz this a little bit because it's like,

1265
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,840
so we're, so we're remaking a game that just came out last year.

1266
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,400
But then I think, all right, well, but at the same time, at least they gave you everything

1267
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,080
and didn't just move the game and have you rebuy everything.

1268
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,080
Yeah.

1269
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:11,760
Well, and the other thing is too that the, you know, it's not uncommon for big games

1270
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,960
to get a like game of the year edition that includes everything.

1271
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:21,280
That's kind of what this is, but yet they, they, they turned it up for these new consoles,

1272
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,680
which I find, it's just interesting.

1273
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,840
We haven't, I haven't really seen something like this that I can think of before, you

1274
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,280
know, outside maybe Nintendo remaking some of the Wii games.

1275
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,120
That's, that's just not even the same thing.

1276
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:37,520
You know, I like the sentence in the article on PS4, your controller will light up when

1277
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,640
using the torch.

1278
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,640
It's cute.

1279
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,280
I'm assuming they'll also use the backlight, the eye light as well.

1280
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,840
But the controller is already lit up all the time.

1281
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,960
So am I using the torch all the time?

1282
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,960
Perhaps.

1283
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,120
It's gonna change colors.

1284
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:56,360
The big thing about that for me personally though, is that given that I've played it

1285
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:05,200
on PC and just all of the just graphical glory that it produced, as well as being solid gameplay

1286
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,680
wise, I think it would be a nice treat for people at home to be able to play it up to

1287
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,720
that level too.

1288
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,720
Yeah.

1289
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,960
And I gotta be honest, as much as I'm saying like, you know, Oh, this is interesting.

1290
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,440
You know, I, I do still kind of want to, I actually really want to get it because I thought

1291
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,800
the game was gorgeous as it was on, you know, even 360 and now they're talking about, Oh,

1292
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,440
we're going to turn it, turn up the graphics even more.

1293
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,880
I'm kind of like, Ooh, I kind of want to check that out for me price.

1294
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,960
Do I want to drop $60 on it again?

1295
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,480
You want to check it out with better graphics played on PC.

1296
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:46,720
But to, to be fair, they, I mean, it's, it's different to be like better graphics from

1297
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,760
what they've got or they are going back and actually upping some of the assets and so

1298
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,760
far.

1299
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,920
I mean, they're, they're, this isn't just repackaging it.

1300
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,920
I think it's playing it on the new console.

1301
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,000
I think it's just putting the PC assets on your, more of the PC assets on the console.

1302
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,920
I don't think they're going back and redoing anything.

1303
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,960
That's not the, eh, that's not the impression I was getting.

1304
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,400
Look, yeah, I think there's more to it than that because especially cause they talk about

1305
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,400
like this stuff.

1306
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,400
I know this.

1307
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,400
All right.

1308
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,400
Well I guess we'll find out in a month and a half.

1309
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,640
But the stuff with the hair sounds very different.

1310
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:19,440
So like that takes, you know, and they, they con they got these other studios to get involved

1311
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,440
too.

1312
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,440
Is that takes work.

1313
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,440
There's stuff with her hair.

1314
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,440
Yeah.

1315
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,440
They, they changed something.

1316
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,160
Their hair is more fluid, hairy.

1317
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,160
It's more hair-like.

1318
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,160
Really?

1319
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,360
Cause I believe that was one of the PC things, if I remember correctly.

1320
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:40,000
I do have to say that there was a difference in, as far as when I first loaded up the game

1321
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,080
with the lower end and then bumped it up all the way, there were a little bit few differences

1322
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:50,360
with hair mechanics, hair mechanics, remember the special thing, hair mechanics.

1323
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,360
Yes.

1324
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:57,640
I would believe that would be the Tomb Raider Tress FX hair, uh, which is an option on PC.

1325
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:02,120
That's the enhanced hair, um, both, you know, the physics and stuff.

1326
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,280
So that, yes, would be a PC thing.

1327
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,920
So basically they're taking the PC assets and putting them on next gen, but hey, whatever,

1328
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:10,920
that's fine.

1329
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,120
You know what hair physics always make me think of?

1330
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:20,480
Uh, Soul Edge and all, and the, the Tekken games when they started doing, you can see

1331
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:27,080
that the strands of hair, I was like, but it doesn't look like real hair.

1332
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,080
I have to say that Lara's hair looked like hair.

1333
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,200
It was very hairy.

1334
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,960
Well, I just thought, I just thought the game in general looked great.

1335
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:37,580
So, you know, it already was starting to look, you know, like, I don't want to say it looked

1336
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:43,200
like next gen, but it just, it looks like such a, it's a, it's a great example of what

1337
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,280
the previous gen consoles were really capable of.

1338
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:51,640
So I'm, I'm fairly certain cause you know, Dan's been seeing me play the game.

1339
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,240
I've gone back and played it, you know, tried to get a little bit further cause I haven't

1340
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,640
beaten it yet, but I did play it fairly consistently and I would love to see Dan play through that.

1341
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,680
But I know he'd enjoy it.

1342
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,200
Yeah, I'm sure, and you know, I'm sure there are some people that miss the boat the first

1343
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,200
time around too.

1344
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,320
I see in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Shane says, Shane Alinko says, this is good

1345
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,400
for me as I didn't play the original release.

1346
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,200
I'll definitely look into getting this.

1347
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,320
So, but then there's a part of me that's like, how did you miss the original release when

1348
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:23,360
the game was like on sale for a steal on some of the very steam sales and so forth?

1349
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:30,400
I used my, uh, my steam wallet gift and got it, like I paid three bucks extra for it.

1350
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,400
So there you go.

1351
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
All right.

1352
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,680
Uh, let's move on.

1353
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,680
More news.

1354
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,680
Loki.

1355
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,680
All right.

1356
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:43,800
Um, let's see, let's talk a little bit about, uh, the Xbox one.

1357
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,880
Um, remember one of the things that they kind of talked about, I think it was a few months

1358
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:55,000
ago, this whole, you know, being able to publish using your Xbox one as like a dev kit.

1359
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,560
And actually some people figured out how to do that or at least get into the dev kit mode

1360
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,840
and I've been dicking around with that.

1361
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:05,840
But, um, for the actual devs, um, they've already, um, listed 33 developers that are

1362
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:14,080
participating in their ID at, um, Xbox, uh, program, I guess if you want to call it, um,

1363
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:21,240
including, uh, behavior, which, uh, I guess they did, uh, wet and naughty bear panic in

1364
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,240
paradise.

1365
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,240
What was a good game?

1366
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,240
Naughty bear.

1367
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:32,400
Not so much bong fish, uh, born ready, uh, Cappy, which is super time force, uh, concept

1368
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:40,520
cry tech, uh, definition six, which did spy party, um, demerge the shoot many robots,

1369
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:46,680
uh, double 11, little big planet Vita, double fine, uh, drink box, gaijin games, the bit

1370
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:54,680
trip series, uh, half brick studios, fruit ninja, happy in labs, uh, hidden path, high

1371
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:59,080
voltage software, which did the conduit, which man, they haven't released anything in a long

1372
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,080
time.

1373
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:06,560
Um, anise, you may remember them, elite beat agents, anyone, uh, iron galaxy, jackbox games,

1374
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,760
um, Nicholas, which the cave story and VVVVVV.

1375
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,640
I didn't know that same guy did both those games.

1376
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,640
Pretty sweet.

1377
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:21,760
Um, ninja B, other ocean, which, uh, the, uh, dark void zero and super monkey ball games

1378
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:29,480
on iOS, uh, panic button, which unfortunately connects star Wars signal studios, uh, slightly

1379
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:35,280
mad studios, team 17 behind the worm series, uh, team colorblind, uh, the men who wear

1380
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:42,440
many hats, best name of development house ever, uh, the odd gentlemen, Vladimir, uh,

1381
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,760
way forward, uh, Z boy games and Zen studios.

1382
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:53,800
If I remember correctly, Nicholas, uh, did the 3d, it's either that they published VVVVVV

1383
01:09:53,800 --> 01:10:00,720
or that they brought it to DS or some other platform because that was Terry Cavanaugh.

1384
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:04,800
And I'm maybe, yeah, maybe they published, they might've done the ports then.

1385
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,160
Cause I know like these guys are doing ports of things and cave story did come out on multiple

1386
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,160
platforms as well.

1387
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,160
It's true.

1388
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:16,120
Um, the other thing that can kind of go along with that though is, uh, some of the, um,

1389
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:24,800
indie publishers are running into, uh, I guess some of their small print things in this part

1390
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,800
of this program.

1391
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:31,040
Uh, for example, not only do you get, you know, I guess the wonderful, like, um, you

1392
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,440
get two console development kits, a unity license, and the ability to publish your games

1393
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,440
by yourself.

1394
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,840
Um, also they asked that, um, the games that launched same day on X-Box one and any other

1395
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:49,280
console platforms, um, they say, um, they want launch parody rather than exclusivity.

1396
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:56,520
And um, I guess one of these, so it, one of the developers that ran into this, um, was

1397
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,280
it, uh, Vladimir, I, yeah, Vlambeer.

1398
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:05,520
Um, they're saying that they, one of their games, a nuclear throne, I guess was supposed

1399
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:11,680
to, they were talking with them about bringing it to the X-Box one.

1400
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:19,160
And um, I guess they maybe wanted it to be exclusive, but somehow because of that, they're

1401
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,600
actually going to publish it on PlayStation four.

1402
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:29,040
Um, you know, they said, I guess, uh, it'll just come out on PlayStation four first, I

1403
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,660
guess they're, they didn't have an X-Box one version available, but they wanted to

1404
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,880
publish it on that platform later on.

1405
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:44,280
Um, but because Microsoft basically restricting you, you must launch your game on the X-Box

1406
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,560
one and then all the other platforms at the same time.

1407
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,560
Oh, I see.

1408
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,720
So, you know, they didn't want to hold up the other versions of the game for the, could

1409
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,400
that be because of what happened with DuckTales?

1410
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,320
Cause you know, DuckTales didn't come out on X-Box till way after the other versions.

1411
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,560
And I think, I don't think it's that.

1412
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,240
I think they just want to have, they don't want to be at a disadvantage as far as like

1413
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,880
exclusive versions or something like that.

1414
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,400
I maybe, maybe that's fine, but maybe they just don't want Sony to have like a window

1415
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,120
on that stuff.

1416
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,280
Microsoft wants to have the window, you know, on call of duty DLC and all that bullshit.

1417
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,280
Sure.

1418
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,360
Um, so maybe that's what the issue is.

1419
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,880
I think though, maybe they can get around it by doing, you know, pulling them kind of

1420
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:28,040
what Microsoft did with, you know, Minecraft, you know, have the Minecraft X-Box one version

1421
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,360
and then Minecraft PlayStation four version.

1422
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,840
Technically they're two different games, you know, and then they'd be able to publish it

1423
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,840
later on or something.

1424
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,200
Uh, Black Wolf says, he wants to try to explain this here.

1425
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,620
The X-Box one wants parody, the loophole.

1426
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:43,500
If you are already signed up for another platform, they don't have to wait.

1427
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:48,400
So they said, quote, Oh, they want parody if I sign, Hey Sony, one a one month exclusive

1428
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,400
quote.

1429
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,400
Sure.

1430
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,400
Uh, okay.

1431
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,400
Hey, Hey Microsoft.

1432
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,400
We want to sign up.

1433
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,400
Oh, okay.

1434
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,400
That's fine.

1435
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,540
So interesting.

1436
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:05,040
This is a, this is a great policy in theory for, you know, gamers consumers most of all,

1437
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,840
because it means that no matter what platform you've backed, if your game is coming multi-console,

1438
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,400
you will get it and you don't have to spoilers or any other consideration that you don't,

1439
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,600
you don't have to wait on anybody else.

1440
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:21,360
But if maybe in theory, because, you know, Bobby just pointed out, there's a way around

1441
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,360
it.

1442
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,360
Yeah.

1443
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,640
As far as games that actually get released on multiple platforms at the same time, if

1444
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:34,560
you do not budget your time, and this article basically talks that, um, that the development

1445
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:40,720
shop, uh, that Vlambeer was caught off guard, but if you do not budget your time properly

1446
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:46,400
or you just come across this, if you are bound to this, it's going to hurt your firm and

1447
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,600
potentially your results and potentially the game because you weren't expecting to have

1448
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:57,280
to put almost almost entirely, literally two times the work in for one release date.

1449
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:02,400
I love this concept, but like anything else, it has a trade off that unfortunately gets

1450
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,820
to be pretty nasty pretty quick.

1451
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:09,600
If I were them, you know, I would just want the least amount of restrictions possible

1452
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:16,680
for the developers because right now the perception is PlayStation four is very developer friendly

1453
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:17,680
Xbox one.

1454
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:22,360
I don't think they've quite gotten there yet where people are kind of recognized as a platform

1455
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,080
that they can find their favorite indie games.

1456
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,600
I would think they want the least amount of obstacles in between them and getting that

1457
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,480
at least at the beginning, you know, hell, change your rules later on down the line if

1458
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:39,280
you know, once you have a decent catalog of indie games, but, and I'm also kind of disappointed

1459
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,440
that they kind of got rid of the whole, you know, it's kind of a twofold thing.

1460
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:49,440
I'm kind of disappointed that they got rid of the whole community games and knew the

1461
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,800
idea of, Oh, I can use my Xbox one to publish my own games and stuff.

1462
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,800
That's really cool.

1463
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:58,520
But I understand, you know, that there were a lot of crappy games on that, that service

1464
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:02,040
at the same time though, it still would be nice to have that ability to put your own

1465
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,040
games on there.

1466
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,600
Maybe it was some sort of peer review or something like that to filter out, you know, those massage

1467
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,600
simulators.

1468
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,960
Let's clear out the chaff.

1469
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
Yeah.

1470
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:16,320
To register participation for this week's episode of orange laundry radio at vog network.com

1471
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,800
use the passphrase sailboat.

1472
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,920
Well let's move on with more information about the Xbox one, cause there's a really weird

1473
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,120
rumor going on out there and it's just, it's one of those things I think it's kind of trolling

1474
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:31,660
people who can't or who don't understand technology or I don't know, because there's this weird

1475
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:35,240
picture going around out there and I'm not going to repeat the description here cause

1476
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,360
I don't want to perpetuate a rumor that could potentially damage people's consoles, but

1477
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,720
it's the equivalent of basically telling people, Hey, if you put up, up, down, down, left,

1478
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:49,320
right, left, right, BA star into your Xbox one, you will be able to play Xbox 360 games.

1479
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:54,160
And there's people, and I don't want to say that they're dumb enough to believe it, but

1480
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:58,940
they're not educated enough on how these systems really work that they actually kind of believe

1481
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:02,240
it because they use the magic words that, Oh, you're going to, you're going to get into

1482
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:08,660
dev console mode on your Xbox one and it'll unlock the ability to play Xbox 360 games.

1483
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:15,360
So let's review. The reason why Xbox 360 games are not playable on the Xbox one is

1484
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:20,620
because the chips inside have changed completely. They are different manufacturers now. Correct

1485
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:25,860
Loki? Yeah, it's different architecture altogether. And actually you see that surprise and it

1486
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:32,020
came from 4chan. Um, and basically it's someone stumbled upon the way to get into developer

1487
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,820
mode and Microsoft said, Hey, don't try to get into developer mode cause it will break

1488
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:41,520
your console because it's two parts. Microsoft that's basically, you know, give you the access

1489
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,140
to this and then you also have to enable it on your console in order to actually switch

1490
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:51,120
it over to kind of like developer mode. If you don't do it without their access, it causes

1491
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,100
all sorts of different problems with it. So if you, if you follow the rules, what you're

1492
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:59,020
doing, you're not, you're not unlocking anything. You're causing your Xbox one to basically

1493
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:05,060
do like an infinite loop booting. So it's just, it's just some troll thing from 4chan.

1494
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:10,020
So, you know, just to be clear, don't get, don't, if you read something that's too good

1495
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:14,660
to be true, it probably is. This is the second time in three months, something like this

1496
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:19,140
has happened. Oh, what was the other one? The first one? IOS seven makes your device

1497
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:25,260
waterproof. Wait, that was a thing? That was a thing? I kid you. I didn't even hear that.

1498
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:30,660
If you go to Twitter search and you type in IOS waterproof, the top tweet minus the fucking

1499
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:36,580
LG ad, whatever. Uh, if you go that, if you do that in a, in Twitter search, I actually

1500
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:40,420
did this just to kind of make sure I wasn't crazy. And sure enough, the very first tweet

1501
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:45,060
in the search results 4chan convinced people that IOS seven makes their iPhones waterproof.

1502
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:50,540
Now they've convinced people to break their Xbox ones with backwards compatibility. Uh,

1503
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:55,060
IOS seven came out, uh, uh, mid September, early September, three months later. Look

1504
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:58,480
at this all over again. I think it's, you know, just a lesson that if something is too

1505
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:04,960
good to be true, it is very, I don't know. It's just interesting to me that, you know,

1506
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,100
there's always, there's always been smoke and mirrors and uh, there's a better, there's

1507
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,960
a better terminology for this. Uh, there's always been snake oil salesman, but this is

1508
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,840
like, this is the, these are the internet snake oil sales common sense. But if they

1509
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,680
had the ability to play backwards, they're have full backwards compatibility. They would

1510
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:25,980
be totally pimping that shit out if not trying to sell it, you know, as a DLC or something.

1511
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:29,060
But they would be pimping that show. Hey, we have backwards compatibility. Those guys

1512
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:35,500
don't. I mean, why would you lock that away? Yeah, it's a silly anyway. All right. Uh,

1513
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:41,620
let's move on to less silly things. How about something that's a lot kinder? Um, well, uh,

1514
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:45,660
there's actually an article talking about the humble bundle and one of the charities

1515
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:49,220
that they've helped out. They've actually been, um, working to bring clean drinking

1516
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:55,580
water to Ethiopia, which I think is definitely something positive that we need to be focusing

1517
01:18:55,580 --> 01:19:02,380
on instead of people being assholes. Um, so basically, um, they worked with a particular

1518
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:07,940
charity that used a hundred percent of the donations to bring clean water. And so now

1519
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:17,220
they have, uh, 3,275 people in Ethiopia that are going to have a clean water. And the total

1520
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:25,460
amount was, uh, it came up to $121,780. So that's pretty good news. See, we're not all

1521
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,380
assholes. I like to hear the gamers doing good stories and it plus it's kind of nice

1522
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:33,340
to see too. We always kind of like, I think a lot of us when we're buying these humble

1523
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:36,900
bundles and so forth, we just kind of click the button and it's like, Oh yay, some of

1524
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:41,900
my money's going to good pat myself on the back. We don't really see it past that. So

1525
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,940
I'm glad there's information out there like this to really kind of show like here is how

1526
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:49,740
the money is really helping. You know what I mean? And I think it's good that they're

1527
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:56,300
being so transparent with how that money is being allocated to and giving us the option.

1528
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:00,740
And you know, it's, it's sort of like, Hey, you know, you do something good for somebody

1529
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:05,900
else. We'll do something good for you here. Have some fun. You know, I've always been

1530
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:10,220
a big advocate of the charities like that, especially, uh, you know, even though I'm

1531
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:15,100
not too fond of Penny Arcade themselves, I've been happy with Child's Play and with a lot

1532
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:21,780
of those, um, charities that basically turns our love of games into almost love for other

1533
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:27,300
people. Right. You know. All right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some

1534
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,140
release dates. And I know this might be a short segment tonight, but we check in every

1535
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:35,300
week on what games are coming out in a video game store near you, starting with the U S

1536
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:39,060
Loki. Uh, the only thing coming out this week is Sorcery Saga Curse of the Great Curry

1537
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:45,940
God on PlayStation Vita. Um, actually, if I remember correctly, there's Dreamfall, uh,

1538
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:50,820
ventures or chronic, I think it's Dreamfall adventures. That's coming out on Xbox three

1539
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:54,460
six. It's been delayed forever. Maybe it's being delayed again, but, uh, that was supposed

1540
01:20:54,460 --> 01:21:00,820
to be coming out. And then guess what? That's it for the entire year. I figured as much.

1541
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:05,980
All right. Well in Japan, uh, things are moving a little bit differently because, uh, obviously

1542
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:09,920
the holidays are a little bit different over there. So, you know, uh, you can pre-order

1543
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,700
one of these games to go with your Christmas cake if you like. Uh, but on the PlayStation

1544
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:18,820
three this week on December 12th in Japan, um, some game of the year additions, dishonored,

1545
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:23,860
uh, crisis three going into best hits, uh, call of duty ghost gets a dubbed version,

1546
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:28,700
uh, released this week. As far as new games go, there's a new PlayStation three console

1547
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:33,580
bundle with puppeteer. That's out this week. And, uh, Jinsei ego to next generation and

1548
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:39,620
Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou comes out this week from Koei. So that's what you can look forward

1549
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:44,780
to this week on December 12th, as far as PlayStation three goes, let me check out three 60. Um,

1550
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:48,860
the same call of duty ghost dubbed version is out there as well as dishonored the game

1551
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:54,340
of the year edition. That's pretty much it for the three 60, um, going to the PlayStation

1552
01:21:54,340 --> 01:22:01,020
Vita Hatsune Miku project diva gets a price reduction. Uh, Vita's region free, right?

1553
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:05,140
This might be your time to pick it up. So you folks here in the U S if you want your

1554
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:09,980
a version of Hatsune Miku for the Vita, this might be a good time to pick it up. Uh, on

1555
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:15,900
the Wii U, uh, the balance board USB adapter comes out this week, uh, which I imagine is

1556
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:20,140
for Wii fit you, but I don't know exactly what that the balance board USB adapter, are

1557
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:23,740
they going to let you start plugging that into computers and stuff? I didn't even know

1558
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:27,260
that was a thing. Um, well, you know what? It's not coming out from Nintendo. It's a

1559
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:31,940
third party, so it must be some type of battery pack. I'm guessing. Oh yeah. Maybe it's some

1560
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:36,100
weird kind of thing. All right. Well that's there, but you can also get monster hunter

1561
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:41,380
front frontier G and a beginner's package that's out from Capcom this week on the Wii

1562
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:48,500
U. Uh, lastly, but not leastly on the Nintendo 3DS, uh, hometown story, Kira, Maki, waku

1563
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:55,260
waku suite, uh, Kobito, Zukin, Kobito, no Fushigi, G, can set comes out this week, puzzle

1564
01:22:55,300 --> 01:23:05,100
and dragons Z. Is that the same as the cell phone game? I bet it is. Yeah. Yeah, I think

1565
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,820
it is. Yeah. Same as the cell phone game is getting like a, uh, spruced up 3DS version

1566
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:15,540
in Japan this week. Um, also, uh, and probably most importantly this week in Japan on the

1567
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:24,180
Nintendo 3DS, hello kitty to Maho no apron rhythm cooking comes out this week. That's

1568
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:29,700
right. You can cook. It's, it's cooking mama meets a rhythm game meets hello kitty. I should

1569
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:34,300
not go back to the name real quick. I shit you not. I want this game kind of bad. Actually.

1570
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:40,580
Go back to the name real quick. There you go. I'm not there. Uh, come on. Close right

1571
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:46,940
there. Hello kitty with the magic apron. It's a rhythm cooking game starring hello kitty

1572
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:53,020
and a magic apron. Why can't I have this? I want this. Give it to me. You're not worthy.

1573
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:59,300
Why is the 3DS not region free? Because it'll come out over here. Bad bats. Maru is making

1574
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:04,980
a state. God damn it. This is amazing. While I would like to point out the project diva

1575
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:08,900
F is being localized and will be eventually released in North America. Some people can't

1576
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:14,040
wait while I are. Yeah. Well, uh, all those DDR games and 2d X games and whatnot that

1577
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:19,780
we have language writing and telling the wrong show, telling her my Japanese PlayStation

1578
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:28,620
2 says hello. All right. And soon my Japanese 3DS. All right. Uh, let's go to the UK. Dark

1579
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:33,940
Sakura. Well, there's, we actually have a good number more in the UK than we did over

1580
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:41,740
here. Um, on the 10th is the novelist for Mac and PC. On the 11th is Angry Birds Go.

1581
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:47,500
The 12th is, um, velocity ultra for PC. And on the 13th is stick it to the man and we

1582
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:55,480
fit you. Stick it to the man. That's the best name ever. I didn't name my firstborn

1583
01:24:55,480 --> 01:25:01,500
stick it to the man. Just a few more stories for you guys than the classic game of the

1584
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:05,660
week. Uh, Y Y R in chat, by the way, saying you waited this long. The game's been out

1585
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:12,700
over six months. That's true because, uh, the, um, that's true because the version that's

1586
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:16,360
coming out in Japan this week is like a best hits type of thing. It's a price reduction

1587
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:21,200
and Y Y R saying you could get the PlayStation 3 version right now. You know what? I do need

1588
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,680
to get that game because I said I would buy it when it comes down in price and I think

1589
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:29,280
it finally did. So I want to get Hatsune Miku, uh, here. All right. Anyway, back to some

1590
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:33,280
news before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki. So like we talked about last

1591
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:39,700
week with Forza 5 and their microtransactions, um, Gran Turismo 6 also had microtransactions

1592
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:44,680
and Sony of course claims that they are not required for players to advance in the game,

1593
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:50,840
but you might say the same about the Forza 5 ones. Um, honestly haven't seen how I've

1594
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,800
seen far less people complaining about these and the Forza ones, but I'm not really sure

1595
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,960
why considering they're both sound the same to me. I guess it's how it's presented. Um,

1596
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,980
they're saying as with previous installments of Gran Turismo, users are able to earn in

1597
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:10,920
game credits and unlock cars by competing in races. And, uh, if you want to buy credits,

1598
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:16,360
they are in increments of 500 or half a million on the PlayStation network to speed up the

1599
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:24,160
process of unlocking content. So I don't know. It sucks that there's microtransactions in

1600
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:29,600
both games, but like I said, I haven't played either one, so I don't know how they're presented,

1601
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:37,760
but that still sucks. Well, the impression that I'm getting from what I'm hearing about

1602
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,960
it is that it's, it's really not like something they're trying to shove down your face or

1603
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:46,120
anything. Like it's not, it's not like the stigma that a lot of free to play games have

1604
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:49,520
where they're like pay to win and so forth. That's not really what they're doing in this

1605
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,640
game because it's one of those things that's optional. You can, you can earn the stuff

1606
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:58,360
in game, which you know is, is any Gran Turismo game kind of did that. Or you can buy it if

1607
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:04,160
you are too impatient to wait and unlock the stuff yourself. Here's where I think people

1608
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,920
get miffed at this kind of thing because I'm sure there's a lot of you sitting at home

1609
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:13,400
going, you know, why is Loki mad? This isn't a big deal. I think some of us feel like,

1610
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,800
especially some of us that really did the old school gaming and lived through the NES

1611
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:21,720
phase and so forth. I remember a day when you would pause the game, press up, up, down,

1612
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,720
down, left, right, left, right, BA, start, and now your ship is fully decked out with

1613
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,440
everything you need to beat the game. And some of us, that's the only way we wanted

1614
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:32,800
to play the game, right? Now, if you want the fully decked out ship, you could sign

1615
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,480
on and pay $3.99 to get the special unlock key. You know who we have to blame? That's,

1616
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:42,960
that's, that's, you know, who started this bullshit. It's always the same company that

1617
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:50,280
starts this bullshit. EA. Cause remember it was with, I want to say the Godfather, the

1618
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:55,640
PlayStation two version, have the codes that you can put in with the controller, just like

1619
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:59,640
you would normally the original Xbox version, have the codes you put in the controller,

1620
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:04,200
the Xbox 360 version, have the codes, or I should say the cheats that you buy on the

1621
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:14,480
Xbox live marketplace. EA is the root of all evil. It's, it's, it's a joke. Yes. But in

1622
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:20,080
the sense, yes they are. They are the root of all evil in the gaming industry because

1623
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:24,080
they came up with the concept of this project, $10 thing where they would do these online

1624
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,320
passes. Everybody jumped on that shit. They did this thing with, you know, like, Hey,

1625
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,440
you know what? We can sell shit that we give away for free on other platforms because people

1626
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:36,680
will buy him because they really want to do that stuff. And so let's just sell it. And

1627
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:41,400
sure enough, they do it and it's just gone downhill from there. But they're the ones

1628
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:50,120
that always seem to be, I don't know, innovating in that area, I guess if you will. So yes,

1629
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:56,600
I am throwing shade at them because it is ridiculous. And you know, did Loki just say

1630
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:06,720
on the show that he's throwing shade? What can I say, Rob? You've rubbed off on me. What's

1631
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:12,200
happened? I know I'm embarrassed myself. Well, you did say you had cooties before. I guess

1632
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:17,520
so. I guess so. All right. Uh, okay. On a, on a much more serious note, cause this, uh,

1633
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,880
this news sucks. There's really no easy way to put it. Uh, an actor named Danny Wells

1634
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:28,160
passed away this week and he was 72 years old. Although you might not recognize the name,

1635
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:34,160
you probably recognize the character. He played Luigi on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show when

1636
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:39,280
it was on in the eighties. Um, with captain Lou. That's right. Captain Lou. Unfortunately,

1637
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:43,840
he had passed away a few years ago, so, uh, the brothers are reunited. They have both

1638
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:53,760
well, some people though, can't bear. They can't stand to not point out the irony that

1639
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,600
Nintendo had made this the year of Luigi and this is how it ends. It's kind of one of those like,

1640
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:04,120
wow, that joke's kind of sick, but it is, it is awkward. You know what I mean? Like,

1641
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:09,200
I don't know what word to put on that. It is a little strange that this is the year was not

1642
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:16,640
dead. Is he? No. John Lake was almost not dead. He played Luigi in the movie because just, yeah,

1643
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:22,000
Bob Hoskins isn't dead either. So whatever. But Danny Wells did pass away this week. So, um,

1644
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,120
rest in peace and thanks for the memories from the Super Mario Brothers Super Show. All right,

1645
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:33,000
let's travel back to a time in gaming's history. Can we get a real twisted version of the Super

1646
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,920
Mario Brothers show with like Danny DeVito playing Mario or something like that? Never say

1647
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,240
never. Anyway, I think he's too busy with the Always Sunny in Philadelphia show though. All

1648
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:47,080
right. It's the classic game of the week. It's a chance for us to go into the gaming vault and

1649
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:53,080
find a game where Dark Sakura says, Hey, why aren't you playing this? Maybe find a game where

1650
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,760
Wikipedia isn't making me log in. I didn't know you had to log in. Yeah, I didn't think you had

1651
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:04,080
to either. So let's see if this reloads. Okay. They get the classic game of the week is the

1652
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:09,520
second of unreleased games that I have spoken about on the show. Although I've mentioned this

1653
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:18,760
one many, many times. It's Thrill Kill. Yeah. So, um, it was an unpublished game from 1998 that came

1654
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:24,720
out on the PlayStation. And the reason why I'm bringing this one up is the fact that it was

1655
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:33,320
really one of the, uh, big games that sort of people were able to get ahold of it because of

1656
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:38,120
the internet, you know, someone leaked out the version and since then we've had, you know,

1657
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:47,000
plenty of other games come out, you know, didn't I bring up, uh, before I, uh, you know, Space

1658
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,440
Fantasy Zone was the other game I had reviewed, but you know, there's been other ones too, like

1659
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:57,120
the Crystal Dynamics, um, uh, Macross game, a Robotech game that never came out, but people

1660
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:01,080
have played it because the prototypes out online. Um, so Thrill Kill is one of those games. And the

1661
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:07,120
big thing about this one is that it was supposed to be a four player fighting game, which I think

1662
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:12,320
it got turned into that Wu-Tang Clan game or something the engine did. Um, but this one was

1663
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:20,320
really a lot more of the, uh, BDSM, you know, had a lot more of the fetish thing and a lot more of

1664
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:27,480
the, you know, crazy murder cannibalism cause it was gross. And then you had the character Judas

1665
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:33,960
that one of the extra characters looked like Ken and Ryu attached to the torso, you know, with one

1666
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:41,560
being upside down or the other. And by the way, that was like the single worst, uh, uh, ending of

1667
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:49,280
that game too. Cause that was the first version I beat the game with. Um, so yeah, it was completed before, um, it was canceled and it

1668
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,200
did get leaked out and now people are able to play it on emulators, modded consoles. I mean, we had,

1669
01:32:54,200 --> 01:33:01,920
um, the, uh, Game Shark thing on ours. So we, you know, after we used to use the paperclip and then

1670
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:07,480
after that we ended up using a Game Shark to play our downloads and stuff like that. So yeah, um, it

1671
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:13,760
was developed by Paradox Development and then later Midway Los Angeles. And it was supposed to be

1672
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:23,840
published by Virgin Interactive who was acquired by EA Pacific. Oh, EA. And then, um, EA canceled the game

1673
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:29,080
because they didn't want to publish a senselessly violent game that would hurt their image. Like they

1674
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:39,160
fucking needed it. Um, so anyway, um, that guy just like pretended to sodomize the other guy and then kick

1675
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:46,000
him in the butt. That's just mean. Oh, she did it too. And then she hit him with an electric prod. Yeah, that's

1676
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:58,400
Jamie. That's gross. This game is so gross. Okay, Rob's mom. Um, why don't you read a book? You know

1677
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:08,440
what? That video that was on the internet just popped into my mind. Read a book, read a book, read a motherfucking book. Anyway,

1678
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:15,640
um, it was the type of game that it is. It's a closed 3d room and basically four players fight to the death.

1679
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:23,520
It has, um, thrill kills, which are like fatalities and you build up a kill meter. Um, so your bloodlust rises.

1680
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:29,880
Ooh. And then you kill somebody in blood. It's gross. So basically the plot of the story is that 10 souls have gone

1681
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:39,760
and descended into hell and their hell is based off of, um, the real world's, uh, sort of deviance, like the BDSM

1682
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:51,680
person. You have Cletus, the, you know, butcher guy. You have, uh, uh, a Dr. Faustus is one of the characters. Um, I was

1683
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:59,280
looking in chat room. Now I'm thinking buy some speed stick. It's not expensive. Anyway. Um, yeah, the chat room is

1684
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:06,920
starting to quote that video. Maybe I should have made that cookie. Anyway. So moving forward is basically, um, each

1685
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:14,880
of the characters is a murderer and, um, they are being judged and so are put into fighting so that one of them can

1686
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:25,840
reincarnate. Um, they go in hopes of being reborn. So yeah, the game, um, it was really, um, like the official US

1687
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:32,520
PlayStation magazine counted as one of the most overrated canceled games and they were very, uh, correct with their

1688
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:38,320
quote. It got lots of hype, but it really sucked too. We just played this because it was hilarious. So yeah, I was

1689
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:46,040
right. It was remade into Wu-Tang Shaolin style and, um, the engine was also used for a two player X-Men Mutant

1690
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:52,520
Academy, um, that was put out by Activision and its sequel and Rock'em Sock'em Robots Arena that was put out by

1691
01:35:52,520 --> 01:36:02,400
Mattel. Um, and Game Informer linked this, uh, 10th on a list of the top 10 games that almost were. It really was

1692
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:12,880
very bad. The music in this was done by an industrial band called Contagion and another group called Dying Fetus did

1693
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:19,040
music that was incorporated into the game, but was not recorded exclusively for Thrill Kill. And that is the classic

1694
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:25,640
game. And I had to bring it up because again, this was one of the first really big ones that spread because of the

1695
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:37,480
internet. And so while it was a festering pile of shit, because it really was, it was notable for being internet

1696
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:44,880
related. Some movies are classics because they're so bad, like Showgirls, right? So, you know, a classic game can

1697
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:53,040
still be one that, uh, you know, is of questionable taste like that one, which is gross. Well, maybe you should go

1698
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:59,880
read a book, read a book, get some speed stick. It's not expensive. All right. Uh, that's gonna do it for this first

1699
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:04,240
half of the show, but we have plenty more show to come, including the Fugu Question of the Week, rapid fire news,

1700
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:10,600
your emails, your phone calls, much more. And yes, there might even, if you're all good kids just in time for the

1701
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:18,080
holidays, I may have a story near the end about pornography. So stay tuned and we'll get to all that and more when we

1702
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,320
come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1703
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:35,480
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this December the 8th of 2013 with the 530th episode of

1704
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:42,720
our program. Uh, all right. We've had a lot of gaming news so far, but there's plenty more news to come. So let's get

1705
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:43,840
right back into it. Loki.

1706
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:56,120
All right. Um, so let's talk a little bit about, um, one of the announcements that was at the whole VGX and that was

1707
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:06,600
that Cranky Kong is going to be the new character that's joined the roster for Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze. Yes, this

1708
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:15,120
was the big announcement that Nintendo had been teasing about on Twitter and everybody everywhere else that they got on

1709
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:23,040
the show to share this incredibly important piece of information. Oh, and the release date of February 21st. What a

1710
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,080
wasted opportunity.

1711
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:32,400
Well, if they've got nothing else to say, I mean, I don't even bother being there. I mean, seriously. Well, I don't know.

1712
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:38,680
Like I get the whole like wanting to build hype for the game that's coming out and everything, but I think, and I don't know

1713
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:45,680
who's to really to blame for this, if it's Nintendo's fault or if it's internet slash fans fault that this was hyped up, like OMG,

1714
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:50,440
they're going to show a new Zelda. They're not going to show. I don't think that they would do that, but like, but there was

1715
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:56,200
people out there that that was the expectation bar in some people's heads, you know, it's just, it's not even that exciting of

1716
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:03,240
news. I mean, it's, I agree. It was, it was, it was blown up to be way bigger than what it ended up being. But I mean, this is

1717
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:08,320
like, this is like kind of one of those bullet points that they go and, you know, during their Nintendo directs, Oh, and by the

1718
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:14,200
way, we have those exclusive news on a new character for blah, blah, blah. I mean, it was something that really didn't need to

1719
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:22,440
be, you know, he didn't need to go to this show to do that. I will say though, that there's a part of me that does kind of see

1720
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:28,760
the humor and that Nintendo really hyped up that they were going to give VGX a big exclusive. And then they kind of pooped on

1721
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:36,480
that. Like that is kind of funny in a way you have to, you have to see the humor in that at least that is kind of, I mean, I don't

1722
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:42,920
know. I'm sure they would have to have shared the news with them, but it'd been kind of, let's just play make believe here for a

1723
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:47,060
little bit. It would have been funny that they didn't tell them what they was. And so they, Oh yeah, we're gonna give them on the

1724
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:55,100
shows. It's gonna be incredible. Yeah. And they dropped the bomb. Hey, cranky gongs and donkey code. What? That's what you

1725
01:39:55,100 --> 01:40:02,340
had? Seriously? Scott of Tron and chat says the host seemed pissed after this announcement. So maybe they didn't. They did

1726
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:07,140
see you have his, they're like, Oh, what about like news on a Metroid or something like that? I heard some people on Twitter

1727
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:13,580
were saying that it almost came off as rude, like that Nintendo, that they were kind of rude to Nintendo. I mean, again, that

1728
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:18,460
could be through fandom lens. I didn't watch it, but what was your impression? Did you see that? I saw the clip because they

1729
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:26,700
have this like kind of, you know, uh, edited clip thing of all the moments of the show, you know, all the like shit that went

1730
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:35,980
down and I did see that and I don't know. I, my reaction probably would have been the same thing. Like, Ooh, cool. No, really.

1731
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:40,500
What's your, what's your special little exclusive announcement that you're going to have? I mean, that was a cool trailer and

1732
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:46,500
you know, Donkey Kong, but what's your real announcement? Oh, that was the real announcement. Oh, you're going to give us a

1733
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:54,900
release date? Grool. And that's what he said. He's like, Hey, but I already gave your release date and yeah, I caught the, I

1734
01:40:54,900 --> 01:41:01,620
caught the joke and I gave you the release date and this new exclude character. What else did you want? You're like, fuck

1735
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:09,420
something else. You know, I, that's kind of the reaction that it seemed like that they were giving. And yeah, I seriously, it's

1736
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:16,580
like, who gives a shit? I mean, it's, it's not like it's, I don't know. It's not that big a deal. I mean, yeah, that's cool.

1737
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:22,380
It's a playable character. All I'm saying is that Nintendo may not be the ones to really blame for that. And if you look at it

1738
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:30,940
from a trolling perspective, it's great. I understand that. But who, who is this? I mean, Nintendo has to understand where

1739
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:38,700
their dera demographic is, who is watching an award show about video games, not casual people that play video games. It's

1740
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:44,540
people that are fucking dedicated hardcore into video games. They're going to spend the time watching a video games award

1741
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:53,980
show. And when you put this out there, no one gives a shit. In fact, they just, it further reinforces the fact that Nintendo

1742
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:58,700
just doesn't get what I want. You know? Yeah. Like this would have been a great time to announce, I mean, to be, to be fair,

1743
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:04,340
it's, I'm not like, I'm not totally defending Nintendo here or whatever, because this is a, this would be a great

1744
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:09,980
opportunity to come out and say, virtual console games will now be playable across the internet and the camera on your

1745
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:16,740
Wii U, you can see your opponent. Like, how amazing would that be? Except that is never going to happen. That's what

1746
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:20,820
frustrates people about Nintendo. Even if you want to do something lame like announce a character or something, do it for a

1747
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:26,100
game that your hardcore fan base is actually going to go after, which would be Smash Brothers. You know, now it's a new

1748
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:31,620
Smash Brothers character or something. Cranky Kong is the new Smash Brothers character. Okay, that's a little bit more

1749
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:40,140
interesting now. Yeah. You know, it's just this, whatever. For me, I'm not buying the game. I don't even own the console, so it's

1750
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:47,380
not a big deal, but it's just kind of like, you had the opportunity to hype this big thing and then you could have just, I've been on

1751
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:53,420
the fence about this Donkey Kong game. I don't really, you know, I like the Donkey Kong Country games, but I just don't, I don't

1752
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:59,260
know. I just kind of feel like there'll be other stuff I want to play when this game comes out. This didn't exactly sway me into

1753
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:05,180
the must buy category. Let's just put it that way. Donkey Kong Country was special when it was on Super Nintendo. Yes, and I think

1754
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:09,860
it's, I think that's, for me, I'm going to be honest, I think that series is a little played out for me. Yeah, now it's been there done

1755
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:18,820
that because there's nothing really advanced graphically or gameplay wise that wasn't done. But then again, then again, Nintendo

1756
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:24,420
does platformers very well. This new Mario game is one of the best of the year. But this is the thing is they're trying to, they're

1757
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:31,140
kind of saying, Hey, you know, new Super Mario Brothers sold pretty well. Let's take the new Super Mario Brothers gameplay and we'll

1758
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:37,260
inject it into yet another game. And that's kind of what they're doing. It's like, Oh, Hey, four player co-op is what's going to be in

1759
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:42,660
this game. I'm assuming because they have another character now. Yeah. So there's gonna be four player co-op in this. And it's

1760
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:49,020
basically new, new Donkey Kong Country, or, you know, I mean, it's kind of what it seems like to me so much for rapid fire.

1761
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:55,460
Act-def made the same point based off the description of the character. He saw the, he made exactly the same point that I was going to

1762
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,260
Scrooge McCranky Kong.

1763
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:00,380
Kinda. Oh, all right, let's move on.

1764
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:09,540
Anyways, Final Fantasy 8 came out on Steam. Some people hated it. Some people loved it. It's $11.99. Same price as Final Fantasy 7. That's

1765
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:18,540
it. Oh, and they tweaked some things. The Chocobo World thing that was a PocketStation thing. That's actually now synced with the game. I

1766
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:26,220
guess you can launch that and play that as well. Um, and then they also have the option to, I think, boost your magic in the game to

1767
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:32,540
like level 100. Um, just by putting an option in to make it, I guess, easier. So you don't have to draw as much.

1768
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:40,460
That's welcome. That's a welcome change. Okay. Now, now I might buy it. Yeah. Now I'm, uh, yeah, I, this changes everything.

1769
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,820
Rob, we need to let's play.

1770
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:44,620
I'll think about it. Okay.

1771
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,380
All right. And then, uh, it goes on sale.

1772
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:53,260
Kelly, I got to read a real quick comment in the chat about the Nintendo thing and it's, it's really good. So I need to get this out there.

1773
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:59,700
As the 200 Matt says, but you know what? Nintendo still makes bank, so they don't have to announce anything. Sadly, it bothers people

1774
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:06,460
because Nintendo comes off like the old uncle who keeps giving their nephews the same gift every year for Christmas, the past 20 years.

1775
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,020
I like it when that gift is money.

1776
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:10,260
I thought that analogy was pretty clever anyway.

1777
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:17,660
Well, Nintendo's, I mean, to be fair, Nintendo, if we're going to go back to it, Nintendo is starting to serialize their Mario games.

1778
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:21,260
You know, we give all these other companies shit for releasing yearly released games.

1779
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:23,340
Nintendo's kind of done that with Mario.

1780
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:27,100
It's starting to get kind of redundant.

1781
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:30,900
Like I don't, I mean, Mario games are good and stuff, but let's, let's mix it up.

1782
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:33,740
Like, like I would love to see a new franchise for Nintendo.

1783
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:40,820
I would love that, you know, instead of Mario, Metroid, Zelda, Kirby, I guess.

1784
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:46,180
I would almost buy that argument except for two big, big reasons.

1785
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:52,900
A, the Mario games are almost bar none some of the best of the year every single time they come out.

1786
01:45:52,980 --> 01:46:00,860
And you know, you don't hear that about a Madden game or even about DDR or whatever serial game you want to talk about because that Mario 3D world is on point.

1787
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:06,780
And you know, if they can crank out something like that, then every year, then bring me it every year because that game is fucking amazing.

1788
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:12,180
B, Nintendo has tried some other franchises and they flopped.

1789
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:13,300
Steel Diver.

1790
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,500
Have they really tried?

1791
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:18,100
Was that really an attempt?

1792
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:24,500
They put it out as, you know, a somewhat launch title for the 3DS and then that was it.

1793
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,260
They didn't support it any further than that.

1794
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,420
It wasn't really an attempt.

1795
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:28,540
Nintendo Land.

1796
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:31,940
Monita isn't exactly going to be an in-demand Smash Brothers character.

1797
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,020
Let's be real.

1798
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:36,460
Monita's a little done.

1799
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:38,460
Monita's going to get unplugged after that one.

1800
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:38,860
Come on.

1801
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:40,100
I don't know.

1802
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:42,060
I just think that there's a lot more they could be doing.

1803
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:45,580
Final Fantasy Realm Reborn.

1804
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:49,340
PlayStation 4 version is going to launch April 2014.

1805
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:51,180
At least that's what's been announced in Japan.

1806
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:53,180
Well, we found when you're going to get your system again, Rob.

1807
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:53,860
Right.

1808
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:59,100
I think it's probably most likely going to have probably around the same time for North America as well.

1809
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:00,660
So that's exciting.

1810
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:03,940
And that was a 100% completely accurate statement by Jason.

1811
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:06,660
YYR makes a very good point.

1812
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:09,620
How about a new Star Fox that plays like Star Fox?

1813
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:10,500
How about a new F-Zero?

1814
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:11,620
Developed by Nintendo.

1815
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:13,500
Yes.

1816
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:20,420
Well, here I have some Nintendo news that, you know, might, I don't know, might change things a little bit.

1817
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:22,180
But honestly, this one, not really.

1818
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:27,300
Because Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams could be coming to Wii U in 2014.

1819
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:30,340
Some of the new DLC for the Wii U.

1820
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:37,420
Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, it's a good game, but it's like, this isn't the type of news that's really going to turn a lot of heads.

1821
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:38,860
It's just, okay, you know, cool.

1822
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:40,940
Indie's on Wii U, still going there.

1823
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:44,020
And it's nice to hear about DLC actually working on Wii U.

1824
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:45,620
So, cool.

1825
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:47,220
So there you go.

1826
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:58,340
They do say now, in an interview with the studio head, Arian Gorsh, says that the Wii U version is more fun than other console versions because it was revised for a cleaner cut.

1827
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:02,420
And they say the Wii U is the best console for indie releases.

1828
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:11,700
That's what makes this noteworthy, if nothing else, is that, you know, even though some big studios are turning away and shunning the Wii U, some of the indies really, really love it.

1829
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:15,820
Some other people that really, really love the Wii U, Time Magazine.

1830
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:26,540
And usually I wouldn't note these types of things, but when it's coming from something that's a little more mainstream and not like gamer or tech focused, like Time Magazine, and granted they have different sections.

1831
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:37,660
But Time Magazine came out with an article that said, these are 10 reasons why this holiday season you should get a Wii U and not a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One.

1832
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:50,380
And this isn't really something that the media at large is really talking about because everybody's focusing on PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 1, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, like a lot of people kind of already written off Wii U.

1833
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:55,460
But a time writer, Matt Peckham, came out and said, you know what, here's some reasons why you should choose the Wii U.

1834
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:56,580
It boils down to this.

1835
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:59,140
Number one, it has the games you want to play now.

1836
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:02,100
Number two, and it'll have the games you want to play next year.

1837
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:05,780
Number three, the Wii U game pad is a portable console.

1838
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:08,340
That's a little sketch.

1839
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:09,620
And I'm also kind of scratching-

1840
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:12,260
And by portable you mean within your house then maybe.

1841
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:19,660
And I'm also scratching my head at the games you want to play next year and the games you want to play now because what if those games have to be from EA, then you're not playing those games.

1842
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:25,180
Number four, it is $300, which is $100 less than the PlayStation 4, so it's the cheapest.

1843
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:28,300
Number five, there's no annual subscription fee.

1844
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:31,260
Number six, it's high def enough.

1845
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:35,140
Number seven, Wii U games are cheaper on balance.

1846
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:37,340
I think that has to do with DLC and all that.

1847
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,940
Number eight, Nintendo has the eShop.

1848
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:41,620
Sony and Microsoft have Nada.

1849
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:45,740
That makes no sense to me where he was going with that bullet point because-

1850
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:48,300
Yeah, I didn't get that one there, I straight up laughed at that one.

1851
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:51,980
This whole article seems kind of, you know, pantsy.

1852
01:49:52,380 --> 01:50:03,620
Yes, but I think there's too many people that have written off the Wii U when I think in some ways the Wii U does make a decent case where it could be the system this year.

1853
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:08,740
And you can wait on the other systems until next year because it does have more games that are available, period.

1854
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:18,380
I'll tell you what, since I was such a great marketing person for the PlayStation 4 last week, allow me to provide my services for the Wii U.

1855
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:22,660
The Wii U is a good choice for your family.

1856
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:30,220
It has a lot of great family games, especially if you love the Nintendo games that you played a long time ago, it's going to have a lot of your favorite classics and stuff.

1857
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:32,420
And that's what you're looking for. This is going to be a great console for you.

1858
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:37,060
Plus the second screen controller is awesome when someone wants to watch TV or play something else or whatever.

1859
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:38,900
I mean, it's great as far as that goes.

1860
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:44,420
And yes, it is cool that you don't have to pay for an online subscription for their online service.

1861
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:45,820
That's a plus.

1862
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:50,500
And also a lot of the games are going to be cheaper, usually.

1863
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:59,820
Then again, also there's, I don't know, I should say a lot more family friendly options for the Wii U.

1864
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:03,180
And what else could I possibly say?

1865
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:07,780
If you like Mario and Zelda games that much, get one.

1866
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:13,300
It's also the only console that's kind of focused on family gameplay and more local gameplay as well.

1867
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:16,100
And it's also a console that's very friendly to indie games.

1868
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:20,780
So you're going to find a lot of the games that have the same features and kind of gameplay that you...

1869
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:22,980
That's funny because that was dude's number nine.

1870
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:25,620
It has an indie lineup, has a decent indie lineup.

1871
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:31,340
By the way, just to clarify the eShop thing, the writer was talking more about the virtual console and the backwards compatibility

1872
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:35,860
where you can play the Nintendo, Super Nintendo and Wii games all because of virtual console.

1873
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:38,100
It wasn't so much the fact that it has an online store.

1874
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:41,180
It was more what's available in that store, the classic games.

1875
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:48,180
And then number 10, his reason is that it is more than just a game system with the whole TV and remote integration.

1876
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:56,100
Again, that bullet point's a little bit shaky because Xbox One, you can do the whole watch TV in your Xbox.

1877
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:59,940
I mean, it's... I don't see where... I mean, I like... Don't get me wrong.

1878
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:06,340
I'm not knocking what Wii U does because that TV stuff where you can chat during like big TV events is different.

1879
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:10,420
It's neat, but it's not... I don't think it's nearly as strong of a bullet point.

1880
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,060
I think if you're honestly looking...

1881
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:18,020
If you're buying a console for your family and you haven't bought a game console ever or in a long time,

1882
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:22,980
I say your best option is probably to go PlayStation 3 and Xbox or Xbox 360.

1883
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:24,500
They're gonna be cheaper than the Wii U.

1884
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:27,860
There's a lot more games, a lot cheaper games out there,

1885
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:32,340
and they're gonna have the games you're gonna wanna play this year and next year as well.

1886
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:34,660
Plus, you can use it for TV and all that other stuff.

1887
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:38,100
Not knocking the Wii U as far as that goes, but they just don't...

1888
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:42,100
They have games that, you know, they have the Nintendo games and you're only gonna be able to find them there.

1889
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:44,820
And, you know...

1890
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,340
Alright, we gotta get past this.

1891
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:47,860
Buy a 3DS. There you go.

1892
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:51,140
The things that Nintendo has to work on, according to the article, just to be fair.

1893
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:53,460
Drop the system price again.

1894
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:58,820
We need a new killer Zelda or Metroid or new Nintendo IP we haven't seen before.

1895
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:00,420
Almost echoing what we just said.

1896
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:05,620
And needs more third-party games, which I really don't know how they're gonna get out of that one.

1897
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:08,420
It may take throwing money at people. We'll see.

1898
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:10,740
Alright, one other thing I wanna talk about...

1899
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:13,380
Wait a second. I gotta ask here.

1900
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:15,220
It says, thanks, Colette, at the bottom there.

1901
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:19,140
And then at the very top, though, it's written by a guy named, you know...

1902
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:22,580
This particular website was tipped off from somebody else, probably.

1903
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:27,380
Colette tipped off my Nintendo news about the time article.

1904
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:30,100
Oh, okay, got it. Matt Peck...

1905
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:31,060
Okay, I...

1906
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:32,100
Okay, so that...

1907
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:32,600
I...

1908
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:34,020
Should've looked where...

1909
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:34,900
I don't know.

1910
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:36,420
It just seemed very vague.

1911
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:39,540
It was very thrown, extended, multiple...

1912
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:40,100
Yeah.

1913
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:40,500
Alright.

1914
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,540
Alright, moving on.

1915
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:47,220
There's some news about the Typing of the Dead DLC for Typing of the Dead Overkill.

1916
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:48,340
This time...

1917
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:50,340
Now, you might be thinking, Rob, didn't you talk about this last week?

1918
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:52,980
But no, this is different, because this one is free!

1919
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:55,460
Free DLC, as opposed to having to pay for it.

1920
01:53:55,460 --> 01:54:02,020
So, this DLC will turn the game's phrases into lines of commentary from Football Manager.

1921
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:06,580
So, if you wanna type football phrases, such as,

1922
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:14,340
horror leg break, spooned it over, agent's fees, little flick off, Manchester Derby...

1923
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,940
If you wanna type any of those phrases, you can do that.

1924
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,860
It's cute, and it's free.

1925
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:20,820
So, cool.

1926
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:23,380
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1927
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:24,340
I have some stuff.

1928
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:32,580
First of all, for fans of the Ys series, there is a fan translation for Ys V.

1929
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:39,780
That was, it never came out in the US, it came out in 1995 on the Super Famicom,

1930
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:46,020
and instead of the type of combat that the earlier Ys games had,

1931
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:50,660
it was a lot more Zelda-like, for lack of a better description.

1932
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:54,580
And since, basically, if I do remember correctly,

1933
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,740
I think it's the same group that did Ys IV Dawn of Ys.

1934
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:59,620
So, if you want it, go get it.

1935
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:09,140
Also, Ultra Street Fighter IV will actually be available as a digital upgrade,

1936
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:13,860
that is going to be for $14.99 in early June.

1937
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:17,220
That's also the same price as in terms of Euros,

1938
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:20,100
so they're actually kind of getting it a little bit cheaper than...

1939
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:24,260
No, they're getting it more expensive than we are.

1940
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:25,220
So, oops.

1941
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:30,180
So, you can get the full bundle, however, for $40.

1942
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:37,380
And I watched the location testing for it.

1943
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:38,580
Some pretty neat stuff.

1944
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:40,980
Poison actually was pretty, pretty badass.

1945
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:45,860
And then, for Video Games Live,

1946
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:51,220
Akira Yamaoka is going to be at the Dubai show on December 13th.

1947
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:54,740
So, if you're there, film it, and send it to me.

1948
01:55:56,180 --> 01:55:57,620
And stalk him for me, because...

1949
01:55:58,980 --> 01:55:59,540
Yeah.

1950
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:00,740
I mean, no.

1951
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:01,240
Oh, no.

1952
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:03,400
All right.

1953
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:06,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1954
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:10,180
He...

1955
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:16,420
Yamaoka did the soundtrack, or some aspect thereof, to Bioshock?

1956
01:56:17,620 --> 01:56:18,820
Where's an evil?

1957
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:20,020
I'm confused about this.

1958
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:23,540
I think that's just some of the other stuff that they're playing.

1959
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:26,100
That his spin on it could be...

1960
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:26,500
Maybe.

1961
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:26,980
Could be.

1962
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:31,060
It's either his spin on it, or it's just something Video Games Live plays the music from that stuff.

1963
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:32,900
I was very confused for a moment to continue.

1964
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:34,980
I think it's Video Games Live, probably.

1965
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:35,220
Yeah.

1966
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:36,660
All right.

1967
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:38,740
Let's get into the FUGL question of the week.

1968
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:41,780
You take Facebook, you take Google, you smash it together, you get FUGL.

1969
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:55,860
Let's go to our question, as we do post every week on our Facebook page.

1970
01:56:55,860 --> 01:57:02,020
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio

1971
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:05,300
are the places where you can follow us on the social networkings.

1972
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:09,940
And we thought this week, in honor of Danny Wells, who passed away this week,

1973
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:13,140
we thought we'd ask a question about 80s and 90s television shows,

1974
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:14,900
based on video games and gaming culture.

1975
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:16,580
You guys have your favorites, I'm sure.

1976
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:18,420
Did you watch any of them growing up?

1977
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:19,460
What were your favorites?

1978
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:22,020
Do you have any memories you want to share about those games?

1979
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:22,900
So let's get to it.

1980
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:25,460
Just a couple answers here over on Google Plus.

1981
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:30,660
Rhetortainment says, wait, I thought John Languizamo died.

1982
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:33,540
I remember John from my first hangover when I watched Land of the Dead,

1983
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:35,780
because it was on TNT and I didn't want to move.

1984
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:37,700
That was a nice way to spend a Tuesday afternoon.

1985
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:38,420
I think there was rumors...

1986
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:40,260
Somebody else from Land of the Dead died, though.

1987
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:43,140
There was rumors about him a few years ago, but it's not true.

1988
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:48,100
Just like the kid from the Wonder Years is not Marilyn Manson.

1989
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:50,820
And what other big rumors are out there?

1990
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,020
Anyway, all right.

1991
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:56,500
ActDeaf replied on Google Plus and says, as many will probably say,

1992
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,660
I watched the Super Mario Brothers Super Show,

1993
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:03,060
though I always waited anxiously every Friday for the Legend of Zelda episode.

1994
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:05,140
It was cheesy as hell, but it was the 80s.

1995
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:08,420
So excuse me, princess.

1996
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:11,060
But my favorite video game show or cartoon from back in the 90s

1997
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:14,260
is probably Sonic the Hedgehog or Sonic Saturday AM.

1998
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:16,020
That series was freaking awesome.

1999
01:58:17,620 --> 01:58:20,500
I also lived for Zelda Fridays myself.

2000
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,580
That was like, if I were to answer this question,

2001
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:25,060
Zelda Fridays were where it was at.

2002
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:28,340
That and somebody had said it here on Facebook.

2003
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:29,940
I'll read this answer from Degenerate Johnny.

2004
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:31,300
This is my other answer.

2005
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:33,460
If I could name one video game show from my childhood,

2006
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:35,140
it would be StarCade.

2007
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:37,300
It was an 80s game show, pun intended,

2008
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:40,260
that challenged the skills and video game knowledge of gamers,

2009
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:41,860
which was a real treat to watch.

2010
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:44,260
Back in the good old days of G4,

2011
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:47,380
the network re-aired old episodes of StarCade,

2012
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:51,300
which brought back fond memories I felt when I first saw the show.

2013
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:54,580
That would also be my other answer.

2014
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:56,020
I loved game shows.

2015
01:58:56,020 --> 01:58:57,380
I lived for game shows growing up.

2016
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,700
I watched game show network when I could,

2017
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:01,380
when it was, you know, early available.

2018
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:03,220
USA used to show a bunch of old game shows too.

2019
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:04,020
I remember that.

2020
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:07,860
And so, yeah, I loved that show.

2021
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:10,900
And honestly, it would be my dream.

2022
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:14,340
If I could do anything in my little broadcasting career,

2023
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:17,940
quote unquote, getting to host a remake of StarCade

2024
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,860
would be my ultimate dream in life.

2025
01:59:19,860 --> 01:59:22,260
But, you know, I know that that's going to be

2026
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:23,620
a little bit difficult to do.

2027
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:25,940
But if you ask me,

2028
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:27,540
what do you really want to do more than anything?

2029
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:32,420
I would love to host a resurgence of that show StarCade,

2030
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:34,260
because that game, that show was awesome.

2031
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:38,420
Unfortunately, with arcades kind of on their way out,

2032
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:39,220
I don't know.

2033
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:41,780
It would have to be focused on retro games or something.

2034
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:45,540
Maybe with the King of Kong and how well that does and all that.

2035
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:45,860
All right.

2036
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:46,820
Anyway.

2037
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:48,900
Barcade.

2038
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:49,540
Yeah, you never know.

2039
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:52,180
Let's see some other answers here.

2040
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:57,140
KJ says very fond memories of GameProTV.

2041
01:59:57,140 --> 01:59:59,380
Captain and the GameMaster, Super Mario Bros. Super Show,

2042
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:01,940
and the short lived Legend of Zelda cartoon.

2043
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:03,860
Although I used to yell at my TV when those kids

2044
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:06,180
were playing video game challenges on Nick Arcade.

2045
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:08,420
Mainly because those kids couldn't play Neo Geo games

2046
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:09,380
to save their lives.

2047
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:12,180
Or any other system for that matter.

2048
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:15,220
Tiger Claw says as a kid growing up in the 80s,

2049
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:17,380
I remember watching Saturday Supercade,

2050
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:20,100
a block of cartoons based on classic 80s arcade games

2051
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:23,380
like Donkey Kong, which was Mario's first appearance on TV.

2052
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:25,700
I remember watching all cartoon versions of the first three

2053
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:27,060
Super Mario games as well.

2054
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:30,180
Captain and the GameMaster was also my favorite series growing up.

2055
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:34,500
Ronnie B says Pokemon, if that counts.

2056
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:36,100
Why not?

2057
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:37,220
It does.

2058
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:37,620
It does.

2059
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:39,140
Let's see.

2060
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:44,900
Fifth Dream says I like the crap out of the Qbert cartoon when I was a kid.

2061
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:47,060
And I still get the theme song from the pole position

2062
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:49,060
cartoon stuck in my head now and then.

2063
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:51,780
I also liked a Dragon Quest anime called Dragon Warrior

2064
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,780
that I recorded every week on VHS.

2065
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:55,220
You know what?

2066
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:57,620
I actually, I just mentioned Qbert in the chat room.

2067
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:00,340
I used to watch that too because it was sort of like,

2068
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:02,900
they're on another planet, but they're based off of 50s American culture.

2069
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:04,740
And Pac-Man.

2070
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:07,860
Jonko, one of our friends from Koopa Club replied and said,

2071
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:10,820
I used to watch Captain N every morning before school.

2072
02:01:10,820 --> 02:01:13,460
And then when I came home, I'd run around with my NES controller

2073
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:16,260
wrapped around my waist like a belt, brandishing my zapper.

2074
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:19,860
I convinced myself that I was going to be Captain N when I grew up.

2075
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:23,780
20 years later, I made it happen through the magic of cosplay.

2076
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:24,100
Awesome.

2077
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:26,580
And by the way, I just want to point out Jonko's little icon right now,

2078
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:30,100
his little user picture is his cap, is Captain N cosplay.

2079
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:30,980
So props to you.

2080
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:34,340
One more answer here from Raginator who said,

2081
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:37,380
yeah, I watched stuff like Captain N, Super Mario Brothers Super Show,

2082
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:39,700
and it's ilk back in the late 80s and early 90s.

2083
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:42,580
Even then I thought that the quality of shows were kind of crappy,

2084
02:01:42,580 --> 02:01:45,780
but considered the overall lack of any real meaningful choices

2085
02:01:45,780 --> 02:01:49,060
of gaming related programming, I felt resigned to picking the

2086
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:51,460
less crappy of the crappy.

2087
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:53,220
Those are some of the answers from Facebook.

2088
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:57,700
If you want to see the rest, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

2089
02:01:58,260 --> 02:01:59,780
Any other shows that y'all want to bring up?

2090
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,620
I think that the chatters hit on mine.

2091
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:03,060
Well, there was the Pac-Man one.

2092
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:07,300
Yeah, even the Christmas special, which I actually went back and watched.

2093
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:08,660
It was horrible.

2094
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:11,380
I knew I watched Captain N.

2095
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:13,620
I hated how the characters were characterized,

2096
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:15,780
but I loved seeing the different worlds that they'd go to.

2097
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:17,140
I thought the Game Boy was stupid.

2098
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:21,300
And while it isn't a video game one, it's definitely one of those 80s

2099
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:26,100
things that had to do with the whole pop music thing was I actually liked kid video.

2100
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:28,020
Do you remember that?

2101
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:28,740
I do.

2102
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:29,060
I do.

2103
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:31,940
And there was another, there was another game show where at the end,

2104
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:35,300
if they did well, they would run through and grab like all the video games they could.

2105
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:36,500
With the velcro vest?

2106
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:37,060
Yes.

2107
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:37,460
Yes.

2108
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:39,860
Somebody in chattel shouted out.

2109
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:42,180
I used to watch that every Saturday.

2110
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:43,620
Yeah, that was the other big video game show.

2111
02:02:43,620 --> 02:02:44,740
That one was awesome.

2112
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:48,020
And then, um, I watched Game Pro TV,

2113
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:50,260
especially when they did the Neo Geo review,

2114
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:51,700
because I used to have that one on tape.

2115
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:55,380
And then I moved out here and Dan had a Neo Geo.

2116
02:02:55,940 --> 02:02:58,100
And I was like, holy shit, these exist.

2117
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:00,500
You know, so it was pretty funny.

2118
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:06,340
And, um, I, I loved, uh, I, I really liked Pole Position,

2119
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:07,860
which I've got all of that downloaded.

2120
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:08,980
Thank you, Tiger Claw.

2121
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:10,580
Video Power was the name of it.

2122
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:12,180
Video Power, that was definitely it.

2123
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:16,580
Do we used to have a listener named Vid Power?

2124
02:03:16,580 --> 02:03:17,060
We did.

2125
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:17,620
Yeah, we did.

2126
02:03:17,620 --> 02:03:18,120
Yeah.

2127
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:23,720
Um, a couple, there was, there was another one that I used to...

2128
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:24,840
Nick Arcade.

2129
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:25,320
Nah.

2130
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:26,280
Well, what about, what about you guys?

2131
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:30,120
Well, she's thinking, Loki, Jason, anything you want to throw out there?

2132
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:31,560
I missed most of those.

2133
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:33,960
And I think that's because I'm just a few years younger than you guys.

2134
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:34,520
I wasn't...

2135
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:35,240
Oh, rub it in.

2136
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:36,680
I, I don't...

2137
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:37,640
Nick Arcade though.

2138
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:39,240
I was like a teenager when that was out.

2139
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:43,400
Well, that's been rerun to fucking infinity, unlike every other show.

2140
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:43,800
True.

2141
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:45,800
Um, so Nick Arcade is what I live for.

2142
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:52,360
There was one that, that, that made me, uh, react in similar ways that wasn't actually

2143
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:53,560
video game related.

2144
02:03:53,560 --> 02:04:01,240
Um, I caught it on, uh, Fox Family, ABC, whatever that, that network has been, uh, called Masters

2145
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:01,880
of the Maze.

2146
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:08,040
Um, it was, it was a, it was a trivia game and you run through the maze with this big

2147
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:13,560
suit and, uh, the, your, your assistant uses the joystick to tell you which way to go and

2148
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:18,200
you have all these good gadgets and doodads on your vest that don't actually do anything

2149
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:19,160
in a blind or visor.

2150
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,280
It was, it was silly.

2151
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:20,840
Uh, yeah.

2152
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:22,920
And love Nick, Nick, Nick Arcade.

2153
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:29,800
Um, when I was thinking about shows that I used to watch, PBS had this afterschool special

2154
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:35,720
show called Square One and they had, yes, yes, that show was the bomb.

2155
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:36,760
Math, Math Man.

2156
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:40,440
Yeah, that show was the shit that came to mind as soon as you guys were talking about

2157
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:42,120
and math net.

2158
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:43,960
I, that was like one of my favorite shows.

2159
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:44,600
It was awesome.

2160
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:47,000
I used to fucking run the fuck home so I could watch Square One.

2161
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:47,960
Like what a nerd.

2162
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:50,840
I'm running home to watch educational programming, but that show was the shit.

2163
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,600
I am glad people are reacting to the show.

2164
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:53,000
Yes.

2165
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:53,400
Oh God.

2166
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:54,840
You never, ever heard of it.

2167
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:55,560
Oh, in chat room.

2168
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:56,600
I'm sure they're lighting up too.

2169
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:57,160
There was that.

2170
02:04:57,160 --> 02:04:59,000
And then three, two, one contact was huge.

2171
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:05,320
Um, I was a little, little, little too young for electric company.

2172
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,440
I don't remember that as much.

2173
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:06,760
Yeah.

2174
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:08,760
I, I remember electric company.

2175
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:16,520
So that one was, uh, was definitely one for me, but I'm trying to, to,

2176
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:19,240
now I'm actually having to pull up a list to remember.

2177
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:19,640
Hold on.

2178
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:20,680
I've got something for Jason.

2179
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:21,080
You ready?

2180
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:21,640
You ready?

2181
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:22,440
You ready, Jason?

2182
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:25,640
You've already seen this much of Square One TV.

2183
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:26,920
How much do you figure is left?

2184
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:29,800
This is 0.44 on the screen.

2185
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:30,200
Here we go.

2186
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:37,000
Math Man, your mission is to eat only multiples of six.

2187
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:40,280
When you encounter a number, you will have until the count of three to make your decision.

2188
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,360
Oh no, not the glitch.

2189
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:48,680
Why did they ever turn this into an actual game?

2190
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:51,320
Like we had 72.

2191
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:52,280
Is that a multiples of six?

2192
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:52,780
Quick.

2193
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:54,200
He ate it.

2194
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:54,920
He's right.

2195
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:55,420
Okay.

2196
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:56,760
Um, why is it?

2197
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:58,520
This is why they didn't turn it into a game.

2198
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:02,920
Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man, Math Man.

2199
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:04,280
They had number munchers.

2200
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:05,640
I think so.

2201
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,400
Yeah, but that wasn't.

2202
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,480
Number, number, number, number, number, number.

2203
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,360
844.

2204
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:20,040
So I was looking at other stuff, other ones, Rob, and there was like a really crappy Street

2205
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:25,000
Fighter cartoon American done that wasn't, you know, actually as good as any of the anime

2206
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:25,500
were.

2207
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:31,640
And I know that the, I think that the game was based off of, there was Battle Toads,

2208
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:33,000
you know, which was pretty funny.

2209
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:39,720
Um, there was a, there was a Mortal Kombat cartoon that was really awful.

2210
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:41,880
Um, and Double Dragon.

2211
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:47,000
Our, our, our buddy from video game realness, uh, Mega Man 400 is in chat saying no one

2212
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,440
watched the Mega Man cartoon.

2213
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,200
Cause nobody mentioned it.

2214
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:57,240
I caught, I remember wanting to, I think I caught like five minutes of it while I was,

2215
02:06:57,880 --> 02:06:59,480
it was absurdly early in the morning.

2216
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:02,280
So I woke up, caught a pinch of it and fell back to sleep.

2217
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:03,320
Wow.

2218
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:06,280
Queen Samia says they have an updated electric company going on now.

2219
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:07,240
Do they really?

2220
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:09,400
I have to see kind of awesome.

2221
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:10,760
I love the electric company.

2222
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:11,260
All right.

2223
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:17,960
The square one stuff though, just to say we actually had this thing for my homeroom, um,

2224
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:25,400
that was square one for school where we would get a news alert thing and then they would

2225
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:29,960
show like the math man and they would show just little segments and then do, and this

2226
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:31,800
is what's going on with science right now.

2227
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:36,120
So we'd get kind of like a, a special version of square one at school.

2228
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:37,320
So it was kind of cool.

2229
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:42,200
We are currently being yelled at and lectured by a Mega Man 400 in chat for the lack of

2230
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:43,480
the Mega Man cartoon.

2231
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:45,880
Uh, at some point, I guess I'll have to check that out.

2232
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:49,960
Uh, Tiger Claw says there were cartoons that were single shot episodes.

2233
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:51,400
Even Bubsy had one.

2234
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:52,120
Oh God.

2235
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:52,600
Wow.

2236
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:53,560
Bubsy 3D?

2237
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:54,440
Act F'd?

2238
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:54,940
No.

2239
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:56,440
What does Act F say?

2240
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:58,360
I loved Reboot 2 as a kid.

2241
02:07:58,360 --> 02:07:59,960
I tried to rewatch it on Netflix.

2242
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:01,400
It was terrible.

2243
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:02,680
All right.

2244
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:03,640
Uh, we got to move on.

2245
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:04,920
There's still more gaming news to get to.

2246
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:09,080
We could do an entire three hour episode about children's TV shows that we grew up on.

2247
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:12,120
Uh, and maybe that'll happen over the holidays when it's really slow.

2248
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:15,160
Uh, that could be like a good list list, but for now we got to get to more gaming news.

2249
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:19,640
So, you know, we just need to do, we need to do a spinoff show called 30 something T

2250
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,440
uh, radio.

2251
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:25,400
30, the geeks who were in their thirties, the radio show.

2252
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:25,880
Oh my God.

2253
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:27,960
That you might be onto something dark soccer.

Uh, Loki.

2261
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:41,240
So, uh, the launch of battlefield four hasn't been that great.

2262
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:46,840
Apparently they've had server issues like crazy and dice has been just kind of, um,

2263
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:48,600
trying to get things fixed.

2264
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:55,240
So to kind of help with that, um, they have halted work on everything but battlefield four.

2265
02:08:55,240 --> 02:09:00,840
Um, so I guess that's gonna, you know, delay that mirrors edge reboot and star star was

2266
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:01,800
bell front.

2267
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:06,520
Um, and also the expansions for battlefield four, they want to get the game working.

2268
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:11,320
Um, you know, ASAP, we know we still have ways to go with fixing the game.

2269
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:14,280
It's that it is absolutely our number one priority.

2270
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:17,160
And the team at dice is working nonstop to update the game.

2271
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:21,800
And we know players are frustrated and we feel your pain and we will not stop until

2272
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:22,440
this is right.

2273
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:25,320
So it's good to see that they're taking charge.

2274
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:30,440
It's too bad that it took like, you know, a whole, you know, almost two months before,

2275
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:32,200
you know, they did that.

2276
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:32,360
Yeah.

2277
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:35,800
I'm not a battlefield four player myself, but I have heard there have been some issues.

2278
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,240
So that's, uh, yeah.

2279
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:40,360
And code man says there, the servers are shit on PlayStation four.

2280
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:42,200
EA game and servers are shit.

2281
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:44,120
Say it ain't.

2282
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:46,680
So to be fair, a lot of games have launched problems.

2283
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:51,160
My beloved Final Fantasy 14 Rome Reborn was kind of a shit-tacular experience the first

2284
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:52,520
couple of weeks because of similar issues.

2285
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,000
Couple of weeks.

2286
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,680
This game's been out for like six weeks now.

2287
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:56,200
No games.

2288
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:02,200
Well, I haven't skewed perspective because a, I actually played 1.0 and B the beta went

2289
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:02,840
on for so long.

2290
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:04,520
It wasn't that I'm in, I'm in battlefield.

2291
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:05,080
Oh, battlefield.

2292
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:05,400
Oh yeah.

2293
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:05,640
Yeah.

2294
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:06,440
Well, yeah.

2295
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:08,920
No, they, they didn't get on it as fast as they should have.

2296
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:10,360
I agree with that.

2297
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:11,880
All right.

2298
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:14,360
So anyway, uh, moving on with some other news.

2299
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:19,560
Uh, this story is about a beloved system of mine, the Commodore 64.

2300
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:22,040
Yes, I have Commodore 64 news tonight.

2301
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:22,540
Ha.

2302
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:30,040
Uh, this is cool because, uh, Paul Kohler and Mikel Hastert, who did a port of super

2303
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:33,160
crate box, which was called super bread box.

2304
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:41,320
They did a port of super hexagon that is, uh, yeah, which was a more recent game, but

2305
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:44,920
they actually ported that to the Commodore 64.

2306
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:47,400
So let me actually play a little bit of this in studio.

2307
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:51,400
Well, it doesn't really do anything at the beginning, but then when it gets into the

2308
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:59,320
video here a little bit, check out that sweet Commodore 64 synth music when it gets a little

2309
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:03,160
further here in the video, maybe, but you can actually play this in an emulator or you

2310
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:05,080
can actually play it on a regular system.

2311
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:07,800
Nice.

2312
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:08,600
I'm rocking out.

2313
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:11,320
I know what I'm going to play this week.

2314
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:13,480
Props to you guys for doing this.

2315
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:15,560
This looks great for a Commodore 64 game.

2316
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:21,720
I wonder if Terry Cavanaugh likes the Commodore 64, considering that these two last titles

2317
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:26,280
have been Commodore 64 looking games for those who did not know.

2318
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:33,240
I think a lot of people, I think a lot of people were influenced by the Commodore 64.

2319
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:39,560
That was actually, uh, I, with the exception of educational games and maybe one or two

2320
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:42,600
other random things like that, which I talked about three weeks ago.

2321
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:48,840
Um, I, I never owned a Commodore 64, so I'm pretty distanced from like tape loading and

2322
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:52,680
actually understanding its extended basic that you have to use and all that kind of

2323
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:53,480
stuff.

2324
02:11:53,480 --> 02:12:01,160
But I loved the games I played on Commodore 64, uh, Space Taxi, um, Beachhead.

2325
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:05,880
Some, I want to say it was Top Gun, but it was something Dogfight like.

2326
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:10,680
And then this, I used to play the hell out of this game and it was by the makers of Beachhead.

2327
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:12,760
I need to do a let's remember video for this plug plug.

2328
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:13,880
Maybe I'll do that this week.

2329
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:15,240
It's a good week for YouTube.

2330
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:15,480
Yeah.

2331
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:19,080
This, uh, it was by the makers of Beachhead.

2332
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:19,640
They did a game.

2333
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:24,120
This is kind of, it's kind of wrong if you think about it, but it was definitely a relic

2334
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:24,840
of the eighties.

2335
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:27,160
It was a game called Raid Over Moscow.

2336
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:27,960
Do you ever play this?

2337
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:33,720
It was a game where like, literally there's nuclear warheads being launched out of Moscow

2338
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:37,640
into America and you're kind of going to stop it from happening.

2339
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:40,440
And it was, it's kind of controversial at the time when it came out.

2340
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:41,640
I don't know why.

2341
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:42,440
Why are we on this topic?

2342
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:42,680
Sorry.

2343
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:45,320
You got me on Commodore 64 kick.

2344
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:48,040
And then you said Beachhead and I was like, Oh, did you know the Beachhead makers made

2345
02:12:48,040 --> 02:12:49,480
this game anyway?

2346
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:53,800
Or we could just listen to awesome Chiptune songs that were made on the Commodore 64.

2347
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:54,440
I'm down for that.

2348
02:12:54,440 --> 02:12:54,680
Ooh.

2349
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:59,080
You know, could somebody write a new OLR theme in the Commodore 64 said chip that would be

2350
02:12:59,080 --> 02:12:59,320
rad.

2351
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:00,760
Do it.

2352
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:01,400
I can ask.

2353
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:02,920
Doesn't Bobby do some of that stuff?

2354
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,200
Maybe.

2355
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:04,840
Maybe.

2356
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:05,560
All right.

2357
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:06,360
Uh, anyhow.

2358
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:06,840
Oh, good.

2359
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:10,280
I'm not the only one that remembers Dungeon Buster in chat says that's a great game.

2360
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:13,160
I always flew the plane into the wall.

2361
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:15,880
The very first thing you have to do is fly the plane out of a hangar.

2362
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:17,400
Cause you know, you got to get a plane out there.

2363
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:21,560
And I always crashed it into the wall cause I was seven and awful at video games.

2364
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:25,320
Anyway, uh, let's move on dark soccer.

2365
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:25,960
What do you have for us?

2366
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:32,920
I'm actually, uh, we're still talking about cartoons in chat and I will freely admit that

2367
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:38,840
I loved vehicle Voltron because, and now I'm actually trying to find subtitled copies of

2368
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:40,680
die rigger 15 that it was based off of.

2369
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:43,480
So I've got all of go lion, which is fucking depressing.

2370
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:52,440
So this is a little bit, um, it's, it's related to video games in the terms that it uses the,

2371
02:13:52,440 --> 02:14:01,960
um, the connect, but there is a robot called Russell that is, um, it was created by scientists,

2372
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:09,320
um, at, uh, looks like a Vanderbilt university in Tennessee that uses the connect sensor to work

2373
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:16,280
with autistic kids and basically, um, and for people who don't really understand autism very

2374
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:24,840
well, um, basically the biggest thing, what, you know, with just about any range of it is having

2375
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:31,240
problems with social cues and being overwhelmed very easily by sensory information.

2376
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:37,240
And with looking at a human face, there's a lot of information that a person can miss,

2377
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:44,520
but working into understanding movements and interaction with a robot that has limited forms

2378
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:51,560
of interaction itself has been helping a lot of these kids acclimatize better into a neurotypical

2379
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:52,200
society.

2380
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:54,600
So it's, it's pretty neat.

2381
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:58,920
There's a quote in here from one of the scientists behind it that says autistic children understand

2382
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,480
the physical world much better than the social world.

2383
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:07,240
So since this isn't as complex as a human being, the child isn't overstimulated.

2384
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:13,640
But the fact that it's using the connect to sense the child's movements and react to it

2385
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:17,720
is, I'd have to say a pretty good application for the technology.

2386
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:27,800
So it's, it's nice to hear about, you know, what the technology for gaming is kind of doing

2387
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:31,160
for good out there, especially when there's been a lot of dog in on connect lately because,

2388
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:35,240
you know, it's a required part of Xbox one and there's really not a lot of games using

2389
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:35,640
it.

2390
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:39,240
So it is kind of nice to hear some of these other stories that help kind of, oh, this

2391
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:41,080
is, this is why this technology is awesome.

2392
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:42,280
Exactly.

2393
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:50,040
And I think that in this case too, where, you know, like I said, where a human can basically

2394
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:58,040
give way too much information for, especially a more advanced autistic case, having a robot

2395
02:15:58,040 --> 02:16:02,520
that's giving much limited information is a lot easier to process and better for integration.

2396
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:07,720
So our, our robot overlords will be kind to us.

2397
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:11,320
All right.

2398
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:13,960
Let's move on a few more stories before we get to the mailbag.

2399
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:14,760
Loki.

2400
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:15,080
All right.

2401
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:21,640
Um, so as I mentioned in my gaming week, I did play a little bit of just cause to the

2402
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:22,600
multiplayer mod.

2403
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:28,680
It's right now they're doing their final beta test of the servers and stuff this week.

2404
02:16:29,240 --> 02:16:36,360
And, um, it will be launching officially on steam December 16th and they haven't given

2405
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:37,800
a price to it yet.

2406
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:42,040
I don't know if it's going to be free or if it's just going to be something that, um,

2407
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:45,960
there's a fee to, but so far so good.

2408
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:47,240
And it's, it's pretty fun.

2409
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:50,600
So, um, look forward to that, I guess in a couple of weeks.

2410
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:56,840
And, uh, if you can definitely join up in the beta if they haven't, um, close out.

2411
02:16:56,840 --> 02:17:03,400
Yeah, I think, uh, JC dash MP.com and, uh, you can sign up there and get a steam key

2412
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:09,160
to, um, uh, yeah, to, uh, get the, uh, latest client there.

2413
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:12,440
So, um, recommend you do that if you haven't already.

2414
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:14,600
Cause it's fun.

2415
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:21,800
You've talked enough about that here on this program, just your excitement for it makes

2416
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:22,920
me kind of want to play it.

2417
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:24,840
It's cause I bet I can get the game super cheap.

2418
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:27,800
Unlike grand theft auto five is still a little pricey.

2419
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:35,160
I skipped just cause one, but I like just cause two is the, is the longest adventure

2420
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:39,240
hunt collectible, collectible game that I've played ever.

2421
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:48,040
And I, and I got to, um, 94, 95, maybe 96% completion, uh, finished the story, started

2422
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:52,040
a second play through like this game is one that I'm actually going through completion

2423
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:58,440
on the frustrating part is that the game is bugged and you literally cannot reasonably,

2424
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:00,920
uh, get a hundred percent collection in that game.

2425
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,080
But this sounds fucking awesome.

2426
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:03,640
So sad.

2427
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:06,200
It's windows only PC only and windows only.

2428
02:18:07,560 --> 02:18:12,520
Well, here's a game that, uh, you'll probably only be able to experience on PC only pretty

2429
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:16,760
soon, although not if the publishers are able to get their way at skull girls, which I know

2430
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:18,520
a lot of people have been talking about.

2431
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:21,800
Um, this game is by publisher autumn games.

2432
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:26,840
And, uh, here's the thing they are terminating their business deal with Konami because Konami

2433
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:31,880
was the ones that actually, uh, got the game distributed and got it onto the Xbox live

2434
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:34,760
arcade and onto the PlayStation network.

2435
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:38,600
Well, because they are severing their ties with Konami, Konami has asked that the games

2436
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:39,640
be delisted.

2437
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:44,520
So skull girls will be removed from the PlayStation network on December 17th and on off Xbox live

2438
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:47,880
arcade before the end of the year when the contract expires.

2439
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:54,600
Now, um, unfortunately what's happening with this whole thing is that, uh, they want to

2440
02:18:54,600 --> 02:19:00,680
replace skull girls with a, I guess a different self published build that actually has some

2441
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:03,000
of the improvements that the PC update had in it.

2442
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,160
They're trying to get that out ASAP, but I get the sense they might've been blindsided

2443
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:12,120
by this a little bit, that this is going to happen so fast because, uh, the design director

2444
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:18,200
for skull girls, Mike Zamet said, uh, that the delisting is, uh, kind of like final fantasy

2445
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:21,320
six is magic user casting Ultima before he dies.

2446
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:29,320
So, uh, it's, it is a bit of a, uh, uh, thing, but I mean, if you're going to end an agreement,

2447
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:31,800
these things are going to happen.

2448
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:35,000
So I'm not really sure what to think in this particular scenario.

2449
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:39,000
I just hope that the, uh, uh, well, I think it's good that they're going to kind of at

2450
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,440
least make the new version a little better and they're going to bring some of the improvements

2451
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:42,840
over.

2452
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:43,800
So that's pretty cool.

2453
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:44,920
And so they'll get that up there.

2454
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:50,440
They need to get it in, I guess like next week, if before PlayStation quality assurance,

2455
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:53,480
like closes for the holidays, if they don't want there to be a gap.

2456
02:19:53,480 --> 02:19:57,960
But I think the reality is there's probably going to be a little bit of a gap before this

2457
02:19:57,960 --> 02:20:03,960
game's available again, but maybe they can kind of make, um, make lemonade out of lemons

2458
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:07,240
or whatever the hell you want to call it by kind of using this as like another way to

2459
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:09,240
kind of relaunch the game and get it out there.

2460
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:12,920
You know, when life gives you lemons, you demand to see life's manager.

2461
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:15,880
When life gives you lemons, you mix it with vodka.

2462
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:20,680
And then burn their house down with the lemons.

2463
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:24,840
And then squirt it in their eyes.

2464
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:26,360
All right.

2465
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:29,800
Uh, let's travel to the mailbag.

2466
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:33,400
Um, I, I figured, I knew ActDeft was a fan of Skullgirls by the way.

2467
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:35,560
ActDeft in chat says support the steam version.

2468
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:38,040
So you do still have a way you can support this game of something.

2469
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:38,680
All right.

2470
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:39,800
I was actually tempted to get it.

2471
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:42,120
So yeah, yeah, it looks, it looks fun.

2472
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:43,880
I just, I haven't had a chance to get, grab it yet.

2473
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:47,240
I just had a couple of friends on my Tumblr who were super obsessed with Skullgirls.

2474
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:47,640
Yeah.

2475
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:52,200
So I know a lot more about the backstory of the game without ever having played it.

2476
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:53,800
So, all right, let's go to the mailbag.

2477
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:59,240
Every week you guys email us mailbag at orange launch trader.com

2478
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:02,600
is the place to send us emails and the dark soccer will go to the email bag.

2479
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:04,040
She's going to dive in head first.

2480
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:05,320
It's sticky.

2481
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:07,000
Gross.

2482
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:10,680
And she's going to see what emails are in there tonight.

2483
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:11,240
We have a lot tonight.

2484
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:11,960
Oh my God.

2485
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:14,600
We got one from an old school listener.

2486
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:14,920
Yay.

2487
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:16,120
I love old school listeners.

2488
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:16,920
Do you remember?

2489
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:19,880
Um, uh, I love new school ones too though for the record.

2490
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:21,560
Do you remember Asian buddy Paul?

2491
02:21:21,560 --> 02:21:21,800
Yeah.

2492
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:23,320
Hey, OLR.

2493
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:27,320
I was talking about gaming news at work one day and wondered how the podcast was doing.

2494
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:29,560
I'm glad you guys are still going very strong.

2495
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:30,760
And that's from Asian buddy Paul.

2496
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:34,440
Um, well, that literally was an email.

2497
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:35,160
Just saying, Hey.

2498
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:36,360
Hey.

2499
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,400
Sup, OLR.

2500
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:38,040
Sup.

2501
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:38,680
Sup, bro.

2502
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:40,440
Sup, bitches.

2503
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:43,800
Yeah, we're, we're still here.

2504
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:45,160
We're just a little older.

2505
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:45,660
Okay.

2506
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:47,560
This comes from Robert M.

2507
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:51,880
Last episode you were musing about dubstep Christmas music.

2508
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:54,600
I got a sample music track a year ago.

2509
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:56,520
The capital King's version of Carol of the Bells.

2510
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:58,440
Easily one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.

2511
02:21:58,440 --> 02:21:59,160
I have heard that.

2512
02:21:59,160 --> 02:21:59,640
And in fact,

2513
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:02,120
Pause for Rob to look it up on YouTube and play a podcast.

2514
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:02,600
Oh my God.

2515
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:03,640
That's exactly what I was doing.

2516
02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:05,480
And for Jamie's ears to recover.

2517
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:07,320
They have that actually at this.

2518
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:12,280
There's a court nearby that, um, decorates lights in all their houses.

2519
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:14,680
And they have one guy that has that synced up to music.

2520
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:15,800
That song actually.

2521
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:17,000
It's pretty awesome.

2522
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,560
I think I saw this in a YouTube ad of all things.

2523
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:21,560
Just in the last couple of days.

2524
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:22,360
Oh, silly.

2525
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:22,840
You too.

2526
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:24,280
All right.

2527
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:26,600
Well, let me get, let me get to it.

2528
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:27,400
All right, here we go.

2529
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:29,160
I'll skip ahead a little bit in the song here.

2530
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:34,360
This doesn't sound anything too crazy.

2531
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:35,480
Let me skip a little further.

2532
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:52,600
That should be right there.

2533
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:56,760
That's that's what I want to record on all of my, you know, Christmas cards.

2534
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:59,400
Now they have the audio Christmas cards and stuff like that right there.

2535
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:00,600
Merry Christmas.

2536
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:02,360
And it drops right there.

2537
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:05,560
Okay.

2538
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:06,520
Maybe it wasn't that one.

2539
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:09,320
He had actually a really cool Christmas song that was dubstep.

2540
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:10,840
But I don't, I don't think it was that.

2541
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:11,960
That wasn't very good.

2542
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:13,000
Wow.

2543
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:17,560
Okay.

2544
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:21,800
Which brings me to this most likely non-video game question.

2545
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:27,080
Is there Christmas music you enjoy any time of the year regardless of your own traditions?

2546
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:30,200
For me, it's the Sonic Santa Claus and They Might Be Giants cover,

2547
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:33,560
Nutcracker, uh, Tchaikovsky, Nutcracker Suite,

2548
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:37,480
and of course Vince Guiardi's A Charlie Brown Christmas Soundtrack.

2549
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:38,920
Keep up the great show.

2550
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:43,000
Um, no, I hate Christmas music to be honest.

2551
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:44,520
I really do.

2552
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:45,320
I never liked it.

2553
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:48,360
Except like Bing Crosby.

2554
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:49,240
I love the crooners.

2555
02:23:49,240 --> 02:23:51,000
I get a little bit annoyed with it.

2556
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,600
It's not that I really hate Christmas music.

2557
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:53,640
It just goes on too long.

2558
02:23:53,640 --> 02:23:55,000
Like Christmas music should be like-

2559
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,600
I'm tired of Mariah Carey.

2560
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:58,040
The week of Christmas.

2561
02:23:58,840 --> 02:23:59,320
That's it.

2562
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:03,160
Not December 1st and certainly not the day after Halloween.

2563
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:04,600
The week of Christmas.

2564
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:05,160
That's enough.

2565
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:08,920
I've got a kind of a weird one that I like.

2566
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:14,280
Um, I actually like, um, the soundtrack to Toys.

2567
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:15,480
Yes.

2568
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:17,800
Toys had a really good soundtrack, but I mean-

2569
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:21,080
They had like, it's not really Christmas, but I mean Christmas themes.

2570
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:24,280
It was, it was light and fluffy and airy for some of them.

2571
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:25,720
But they had like, there was that one song-

2572
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:26,840
It was Tori Amos too.

2573
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:29,320
Yeah, it was a couple tracks.

2574
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:34,200
It was the one, um, the one that they had like the choir of kids singing or something like that.

2575
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,400
That one's like pretty cool.

2576
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:36,920
And Hans Zimmer.

2577
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:38,200
I mean Hans Zimmer is fucking awesome.

2578
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:38,840
What can you say?

2579
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:41,000
For the record, there is a Hanukkah song.

2580
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
There's actually a couple of Hanukkah songs I will listen to.

2581
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:49,160
And one of them is the Maccabeats music rewrite for Candlelight.

2582
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:52,920
And I will listen to Miracle because I freaking just love Matsus Yahoo anyway.

2583
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:53,800
He's awesome.

2584
02:24:53,800 --> 02:24:54,520
Holy shit.

2585
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:57,160
I didn't realize there were so many great artists on this.

2586
02:24:57,160 --> 02:24:58,840
They had Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

2587
02:24:58,840 --> 02:25:00,440
I didn't even fucking know he was on that.

2588
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:01,480
That's pretty sweet.

2589
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:03,720
Hans Zimmer.

2590
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:09,320
I will have you know, I am getting lectured in a private message by Shane Alinko about

2591
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:12,280
dissing Christmas music apparently, which I just did.

2592
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:16,200
Shane Alinko, by the way, bought Skylanders on the PlayStation 4 this week just so he

2593
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:18,040
could get his Christmas Skylanders character.

2594
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:19,160
Just saying.

2595
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:20,760
That boy is obsessed with Christmas.

2596
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:24,200
I've just been ignoring all my villagers talking about Jingle.

2597
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:27,720
You know, they just I'm writing down what presents they want for Toy Day.

2598
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:33,240
You know, they they are selling that Skylander character separately in a couple of weeks,

2599
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:33,740
by the way.

2600
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:39,800
And Ikuma JP says, Oh, my God, in Japan, all Mariah Carey, all the way.

2601
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:41,320
I hate shops that play that song.

2602
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:42,600
Yes.

2603
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:44,200
Kmart has been playing it on repeat.

2604
02:25:44,200 --> 02:25:47,160
And the only reason I'm going to Kmart is because it's right around the corner from

2605
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:47,960
my freaking house.

2606
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:50,200
And they were the only place that had long underwear.

2607
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:57,400
There was another one by Boy George that that's a big favorite in Japan, too.

2608
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:00,920
There's there is a Christmas trick I will listen to.

2609
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:04,600
It was Pet Shop Boys all over the world.

2610
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:06,300
Christmas.

2611
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:09,320
Rob, you need to find that for me because I will listen to that one.

2612
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:12,280
No, no more Christmas music.

2613
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:12,840
What's next?

2614
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:17,080
Um, kind of long email from AZHP.

2615
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:17,800
I'll go ahead and read it.

2616
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:19,720
He writes good stuff.

2617
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:24,040
Hey, OLR crew, maybe I should like channel my mother and use the accent.

2618
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:26,040
No, just read the email.

2619
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:27,320
AZHP here.

2620
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:31,240
I just listened to that bit at the top of this week's show where listener wrote in saying

2621
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:34,600
you guys shouldn't be biased towards Sony or or against Xbox.

2622
02:26:35,320 --> 02:26:36,920
I think that's a lot of crap.

2623
02:26:38,280 --> 02:26:41,640
Anyone who has been listening to this show for any length of time knows you guys want

2624
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:43,400
every console to succeed.

2625
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:46,520
It would be great if every console launched issue free.

2626
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:52,280
Um, had great games that you were dying to play and were controversy free.

2627
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:55,880
But the problem is that's not the case.

2628
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:59,960
And when passionate people like yourselves feel that a company you believed in isn't

2629
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:03,240
delivering what you feel they're capable of, you respond passionately.

2630
02:27:03,240 --> 02:27:06,280
Loki has like four Xbox 360s.

2631
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:08,840
He plays GTA 4 every day on one.

2632
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:12,760
So why shouldn't he be upset that Microsoft borked the Xbox One launch?

2633
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:17,800
It would be more surprising if he wasn't upset about it because he feels so passionately

2634
02:27:17,800 --> 02:27:18,840
about the company.

2635
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:20,040
We hate because we love.

2636
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:27,000
If we take it all back to the very beginnings of OLR, Konami practically could do no wrong

2637
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:32,280
by us even if they never launched a better version of DDR in USA than Konami X on PS1

2638
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:34,200
and DDR USA in the arcades.

2639
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:38,680
That didn't stop you guys from rousing them for their disc DLC and DDR universe.

2640
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:41,880
You guys imported Japanese PS2s to play DDR and 2DX.

2641
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:46,600
That didn't stop you from saying that Kuraragi eats crayons for about two years after the

2642
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:47,960
PS3 launched.

2643
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:50,040
And let's not forget Nintendo.

2644
02:27:50,040 --> 02:27:53,720
As much as you guys love each Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, and Zelda game that comes out,

2645
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:58,120
Nintendo's failure to understand online has always been a pain point that you go back

2646
02:27:58,120 --> 02:28:03,240
to again and again ever since the DS and Wii launched with friends codes and no usable

2647
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:04,120
friends interface.

2648
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:06,940
Hold on.

2649
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:10,360
We, again, we hate because we love.

2650
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:14,280
Everyone's a little bit biased, but we're biased because we know what we want in our

2651
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:17,240
hearts, and when we get it, we're happy.

2652
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:20,440
But when we don't get it, we're unhappy.

2653
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:21,560
Thanks for reading my email.

2654
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:25,320
As someone who has listened to this show on and off since its beginnings, I couldn't

2655
02:28:25,320 --> 02:28:29,080
sit by and watch someone leave the show just because you guys were, quote, biased.

2656
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:30,200
Everyone's biased.

2657
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:31,640
That's where our opinions come from.

2658
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:32,200
Deal with it.

2659
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:35,400
Yours truly is HP, OLR's premier gold star recipient.

2660
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:43,480
Uh, thank you for remembering more than I do about the history of the show and some

2661
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:44,760
of the things we said.

2662
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:48,200
But my one little thing is that I think that the beginning of the email said something

2663
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:52,040
like, well, I think that's crap or whatever, but let's not forget, you know, we got to

2664
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:53,800
respect everybody's opinions or whatever.

2665
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:57,640
And I would just hate for the person who is just trying to give honest feedback last week

2666
02:28:57,640 --> 02:29:01,560
to feel like, you know, like now everybody's picking on somebody for their opinion.

2667
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:02,360
No, I know.

2668
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:04,680
And I just want to make sure it's very clear their opinion.

2669
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:05,400
Absolutely.

2670
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:05,880
Absolutely.

2671
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:07,720
Everybody's entitled to their opinion, period.

2672
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:10,280
I just want to make that explicitly clear.

2673
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:10,920
So thank you.

2674
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:13,800
We can go to the next email now though.

2675
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:14,040
All right.

2676
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:16,600
Well, I'm asking permission if I can thank somebody on air.

2677
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:17,240
Oh, okay.

2678
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:18,760
Someone just did something super nice for me.

2679
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:20,920
So go ahead and read this email.

2680
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:23,400
Last week's opening was very thought provoking.

2681
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:27,800
I don't think that OLR is centric to any specific console or platform.

2682
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:32,760
I do think that many of the viewpoints we hear on OLR are representative of the core

2683
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:37,560
gaming community, though not necessarily representative of the more ambiguous and

2684
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:39,320
generic gaming umbrella.

2685
02:29:39,320 --> 02:29:43,480
The PS4 offers little to no change from what gamers have largely grown accustomed to.

2686
02:29:43,480 --> 02:29:48,040
It doesn't threaten the status quo and I think that it is very appealing to core gamers.

2687
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:52,920
I can add to a large, I can to a large extent understand why the IR against Xbox ones is

2688
02:29:52,920 --> 02:29:56,360
so pervasive on gaming sites, forums, and podcasts.

2689
02:29:56,360 --> 02:30:01,880
Anecdotally, people who spend no time on these types of sites don't share a similar attitude.

2690
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:06,040
By the way, this is written very well with great grammar, although I do miss the Oxford

2691
02:30:06,040 --> 02:30:06,360
comma.

2692
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:16,680
As gamers, I find that our community often, and perhaps the internet in general, loves

2693
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:18,920
to revel in negative news.

2694
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:22,520
To that end, I can agree with the poster that it can be depressing to be inundated with

2695
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:25,720
a wet blanket attitude even in the midst of a console launch.

2696
02:30:25,720 --> 02:30:29,400
A very rare and exciting time in my opinion.

2697
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:32,680
I am not suggesting that we should ignore the negativity and also lay down a magical

2698
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:34,120
rainbow while holding hands.

2699
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:35,320
Dude, that sounds fun.

2700
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:36,680
Only if there's sheet cake involved.

2701
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:41,560
What I am saying is that we also sit back and smile once in a while with the amazing

2702
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:46,600
choices we have as gamers on nearly every platform and at a variety of entry points

2703
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:47,640
and simply marvel.

2704
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:52,440
Every time I even think about getting bitter, my son reminds me how much he loves Mario

2705
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:57,080
Cat, Super Mario 3D Land, and how he wants a Pokemon party for his next birthday and

2706
02:30:57,080 --> 02:30:59,960
I realize that gaming is still as great as we want it to be.

2707
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:02,040
Hugs and kisses to OLR, Dark Charger.

2708
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:03,400
This is an exciting time.

2709
02:31:03,400 --> 02:31:07,320
I agree with that in the email is that, you know, despite all the wars and disagreements

2710
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:09,800
sometimes, this is a very exciting time to be a gamer.

2711
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:14,200
If you think about it next year, just to put this in perspective, we're almost to 2014,

2712
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:14,440
right?

2713
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:19,880
Next year will mark the 12th year of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.

2714
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:25,560
In the 12 years that we've been doing the show, you've had two consoles releasing in

2715
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:31,160
the same month twice and one of them was this month or this past month, November.

2716
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:34,360
The other time was when the PlayStation 3 and the Wii launched in the same month back

2717
02:31:34,360 --> 02:31:40,440
in 2006, which would have been like the second year of the podcast form of the show after

2718
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:42,920
we made the switch from the DDR stuff.

2719
02:31:42,920 --> 02:31:44,920
So, I mean, it is an exciting time.

2720
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:47,080
Moments like this don't come around very often.

2721
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:52,680
And I think from E3, this whole conversation has been very charged.

2722
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:57,480
What was very different about last time is that when it was Sony and Nintendo launching

2723
02:31:57,480 --> 02:32:02,040
in the same month, you know, everybody was hazing Sony because, oh, Sony's looking like

2724
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:03,880
a bunch of crayon eaters right now.

2725
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:05,880
And wow, Nintendo's kind of doing something different.

2726
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:09,960
I mean, that was the mindset of the internet, quote unquote, back then.

2727
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:15,640
Now, I mean, sure, you've got your Xbox and your Sony fanboys and Gran and Microsoft made

2728
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:18,040
a lot of missteps at E3.

2729
02:32:18,040 --> 02:32:23,640
But what really was different this time was Sony calling them out.

2730
02:32:24,280 --> 02:32:26,280
That was a key difference.

2731
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:30,680
And that's caused there to be a little more sting in this whole war.

2732
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:37,080
I think you can trace that back to that very moment when Sony made the YouTube of how to

2733
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:41,160
play used games on the PlayStation 4, where one dude handed the game to the other.

2734
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:47,160
I mean, I know we're not quite to the point where we look at back on the biggest news

2735
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:51,080
stories of the year, but I would say the release of that YouTube was the biggest news

2736
02:32:51,080 --> 02:32:52,360
story of 2013.

2737
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:55,880
I'll probably end up saying that again at the end of the year was when Sony themselves

2738
02:32:55,880 --> 02:33:00,280
put out a video of how to trade a used game on the PlayStation 4, because that was just

2739
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:05,320
that you didn't see that last gen, that kind of slapping, basically.

2740
02:33:05,320 --> 02:33:07,080
Anyhow, DarkSaga.

2741
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:10,440
I am defending my love of Digimon 02.

2742
02:33:11,880 --> 02:33:12,440
Random.

2743
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:13,800
But only the Japanese version.

2744
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:15,000
I really liked that one.

2745
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:15,960
The movies were great.

2746
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:21,160
Anyway, this one comes from Ye Olde Reginator.

2747
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:25,080
Hi, oh, you know, by the way, you know how that began the Ye Olde thing?

2748
02:33:26,200 --> 02:33:26,920
Typography.

2749
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:31,640
There used to be a letter that they did not have a type for, and it looked very similar

2750
02:33:31,640 --> 02:33:33,400
to the Y, so they used that.

2751
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:35,160
And that's why we have Ye Olde and not The Olde.

2752
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:36,680
Let's get to Ye Olde next email.

2753
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:37,560
Hi, OLR crew.

2754
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:38,840
It's Reginator again.

2755
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:41,480
I just thought I'd post some random questions this week.

2756
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:45,720
One, I've noticed that as of the PS2 Xbox GameCube generation of consoles, unlike

2757
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:49,960
previous generations, console generation stopped being referred to as being the insert

2758
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:52,200
number here bit console or generation.

2759
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:53,400
Why the drop in the practice?

2760
02:33:53,400 --> 02:33:58,440
It seems to me that the practice is a quick, easy, and easily understandable way to refer

2761
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:02,920
to a generation of consoles, rather than going the long-winded route of saying something

2762
02:34:02,920 --> 02:34:05,400
like the 360 slash PS3 slash Wii generation.

2763
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:11,480
Number two, with Steam's Winter Sale presumably starting within the next few days, what games

2764
02:34:11,480 --> 02:34:15,560
do the three of you think should be on everyone's radar and should be bought if it

2765
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:16,280
goes on sale?

2766
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:23,320
Well, there was a game on my list, but Codeman got it for me.

2767
02:34:23,320 --> 02:34:23,640
Oh.

2768
02:34:23,640 --> 02:34:25,560
So I'm going to be playing Skullgirls when I get home.

2769
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:26,520
Oh, nice.

2770
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:27,080
Lucky you.

2771
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:27,560
That's great.

2772
02:34:27,560 --> 02:34:28,280
Lucky me.

2773
02:34:28,280 --> 02:34:28,680
Thank you.

2774
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:29,000
Thank you.

2775
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,040
He's a nice boy.

2776
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:30,600
He is.

2777
02:34:31,800 --> 02:34:37,320
To be fair, I gave him a little gift on behalf of the show earlier this week.

2778
02:34:37,320 --> 02:34:39,960
So I'm glad to see he's paying it forward.

2779
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:40,760
That's very kind.

2780
02:34:42,920 --> 02:34:44,280
What else was I going to say with that?

2781
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:47,160
So what Steam games should Rage Nator be on the lookout for?

2782
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:48,760
Is that basically the gist of what I'm hearing?

2783
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:51,160
Well, what we are on the lookout for, I guess.

2784
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:54,600
I'm probably going to get Final Fantasy 13 because it should be out by then.

2785
02:34:55,240 --> 02:34:56,040
On PC?

2786
02:34:56,040 --> 02:34:56,600
Yeah.

2787
02:34:56,600 --> 02:34:58,360
They were saying that there should be a PC release.

2788
02:34:58,360 --> 02:34:59,320
I didn't know they were doing a PC release.

2789
02:34:59,320 --> 02:34:59,720
I thought there was.

2790
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:00,200
Are you sure?

2791
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:01,560
I think I read it somewhere.

2792
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:03,560
I think it would have been out by now if that was the case.

2793
02:35:03,560 --> 02:35:06,600
Okay, well then Dan's the one that told me about it, so.

2794
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:08,520
What have I been keeping my eye on?

2795
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:12,120
I ended up buying Stanley Parable was something I was going to get, and I did get that.

2796
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:13,400
Gone Home I ended up getting.

2797
02:35:13,400 --> 02:35:14,920
Spelunky I ended up getting.

2798
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:19,240
Like all the games I had on my watch list, I ended up getting this past sale.

2799
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:25,160
If Final Fantasy 8 goes on sale, I will buy it for the sole purpose of giving it another chance,

2800
02:35:25,160 --> 02:35:30,120
especially with this thing that Loki was talking about where he can fix the magic system and only

2801
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:32,920
have to draw once, even if it's cheating, quote unquote.

2802
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:37,800
I think that's how I played through the game now that I think about it.

2803
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:39,560
I'll probably get it too if it goes on sale.

2804
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:40,680
Yeah, that's one I'd be looking forward to.

2805
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:45,560
I don't know why I, you know what, I did look this up, and it wasn't 13,

2806
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:48,920
but Dan had mentioned something to me, and I think I had it stuck in my head.

2807
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:52,360
But I almost picked it up for Xbox, but.

2808
02:35:55,240 --> 02:35:59,080
I'm trying to, I'm actually loading up Steam right now to see if there's anything that

2809
02:35:59,080 --> 02:36:02,200
jumps out of my mind as like something I was waiting on to get.

2810
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:04,280
Officially released Just Cause 2 multiplayer.

2811
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:08,040
It's not on Steam, but Grand Theft Auto 5.

2812
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:11,240
Hotline Miami is on sale right now, which I have and is fun.

2813
02:36:11,240 --> 02:36:13,160
I think I got that in an indie bundle.

2814
02:36:13,160 --> 02:36:15,720
I completely forgot for that for my gaming week.

2815
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:17,560
I actually started playing Hotline Miami.

2816
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:19,960
I forgot my gaming week.

2817
02:36:19,960 --> 02:36:22,520
Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed was free this weekend on Steam,

2818
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:24,120
and I played that too because it was free.

2819
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:24,620
Yeah.

2820
02:36:25,080 --> 02:36:26,840
So it's on sale right now too.

2821
02:36:26,840 --> 02:36:30,440
Honestly, Ragenator, I think everything I wanted, I really bought in this last sale.

2822
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:33,480
I'm sure there will be more indie games that I see little screenshots of,

2823
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:34,600
and I'll be like, Ooh, I want that.

2824
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:35,320
Ooh, I want that.

2825
02:36:35,320 --> 02:36:39,560
There are a couple that appealed to me, but I think for right now,

2826
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:41,320
like that Ringrunner one actually looked interesting.

2827
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:47,560
But for right now, I still have the Shiva to play.

2828
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:49,560
I have now I have Skullgirls to play.

2829
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:50,920
I have Deadpool to play.

2830
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:51,720
Yeah.

2831
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:54,840
So you're probably never going to see me on Final Fantasy again,

2832
02:36:54,840 --> 02:36:56,200
because I don't know if there's shit to play.

2833
02:36:57,880 --> 02:37:00,440
But then patch 2.1 will hit and it'll be like, Ooh.

2834
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:05,160
I need to just freaking get past level 31 so that I can do that stupid

2835
02:37:05,160 --> 02:37:09,560
quest that I'm stuck on, my Arkanis job quest.

2836
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:11,080
Anyway, whatever.

2837
02:37:11,960 --> 02:37:14,920
Three, Final Fantasy VIII's recent release on Steam.

2838
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:17,320
Yay, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, meh.

2839
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:19,240
Or Final Fantasy VIII, fuck that shit.

2840
02:37:20,120 --> 02:37:21,320
I think we just answered that question.

2841
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:25,800
I don't, I mean, I realized there was a little bit of a Twitter debate

2842
02:37:25,800 --> 02:37:29,960
earlier this week that I got caught up in, and I kind of started it, so I deserve it.

2843
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:34,680
But I don't despise Final Fantasy VIII by many means.

2844
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:39,720
I just feel a few key flaws in that game really ruin the fun.

2845
02:37:39,720 --> 02:37:44,360
And so I don't remember it as fondly as the others, but it has a good story.

2846
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:48,520
I mean, you know, it's, and it was especially considering you could have

2847
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:52,360
made a game that was very similar to VII when VII did so well, but they didn't.

2848
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:54,360
And they went a very different direction with the story.

2849
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:55,960
And I do applaud them for that.

2850
02:37:55,960 --> 02:38:01,560
So I'm trying to be nice y'all, but it's, it's still the worst Final

2851
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:03,480
Fantasy game next to 14, 1.0.

2852
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:04,200
I'm sorry.

2853
02:38:04,200 --> 02:38:05,000
It's just how I feel.

2854
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:05,400
Opinions.

2855
02:38:05,400 --> 02:38:05,880
I have them.

2856
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:10,120
By the way, they did bring up the Tamagotchi and handheld Digimon.

2857
02:38:10,120 --> 02:38:13,480
They were both brought out by Bandai, which the Tamagotchi came out first.

2858
02:38:13,480 --> 02:38:15,080
Then Digimon came so that you could battle.

2859
02:38:15,080 --> 02:38:22,360
I had the little ones, the handheld LED, or not LED, but LCD Digimon battler things.

2860
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:27,720
And then I was like, I think I remembered naming my, because I evolved to Devimon first.

2861
02:38:27,720 --> 02:38:29,400
And I remember calling him Satan Common.

2862
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:31,560
That was his name.

2863
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:33,080
And I was, thought I would name a dog that.

2864
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:37,960
For, I'm thinking of establishing a weekly Vognite on Counter-Strike Global Offensive

2865
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:39,000
on Steam.

2866
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:43,480
I know that unlike TF2, it isn't free, but it will likely be on sale soon.

2867
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:48,120
Would, would, would be, there are any takers?

2868
02:38:48,680 --> 02:38:55,480
It was actually just on sale recently and I did pick it up, because it means that I

2869
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:59,080
have pretty much the entirety of the, the first party Valve pack.

2870
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:02,120
I have literally everything they have ever released first party.

2871
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:04,920
Mine is Left 4 Dead, one and two.

2872
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:07,080
So nevermind.

2873
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:09,080
This email is brought to you by Star Fox 64.

2874
02:39:09,080 --> 02:39:09,800
Do a barrel roll.

2875
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:15,800
And last email, which by the way, we did have one from YYR, but I.

2876
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:16,760
He said he'd call later.

2877
02:39:16,760 --> 02:39:18,600
I have paid attention to the chat.

2878
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:19,000
Yes.

2879
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,640
And I'm honoring the previous statement.

2880
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:22,200
All right.

2881
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:23,160
Live is better.

2882
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:24,360
Hi, O.L.R. Crew.

2883
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:25,080
I said hi.

2884
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:27,400
Firstly, that's what it says here.

2885
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:31,000
Firstly, thank you all for giving me a theme song.

2886
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:36,360
Sky made a great choice with conga feeling, though I'm waiting for the day he screws

2887
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:39,000
up and plays Miami Sound Machines conga by accident.

2888
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:41,960
Wait, I got a better one.

2889
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:42,920
I got an even better one.

2890
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:43,640
Give it a minute.

2891
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:44,280
Keep, keep going.

2892
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:45,560
I'll play a theme song here at the end.

2893
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:47,880
But enough about you guys.

2894
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:49,320
I'm here to ask your pal Jason.

2895
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:54,440
One, since Jason is now doing intros, is he being paid in peanuts or Oreos?

2896
02:39:54,440 --> 02:39:55,560
I did give him a candy cane.

2897
02:39:56,520 --> 02:39:57,800
He drinks some of our juice.

2898
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:03,320
He's being paid in love and high fives.

2899
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:09,960
I am being paid in involvement, which has been it's what it's legitimately wonderful

2900
02:40:09,960 --> 02:40:10,440
to do.

2901
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:16,760
We said, Jason, if you'll help us out, we will give you what we get from doing the show.

2902
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:17,480
We will match.

2903
02:40:17,480 --> 02:40:21,080
I get an equal share of what we get.

2904
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:21,800
That's what he gets.

2905
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:26,520
Okay, back to the email.

2906
02:40:27,400 --> 02:40:30,120
Has Jason introduced OLR to the Game Grumps web show?

2907
02:40:30,840 --> 02:40:31,640
I've heard of it.

2908
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:34,120
I know of Game Grumps.

2909
02:40:34,120 --> 02:40:38,360
I know I have name dropped it and similar channels that I follow once or twice.

2910
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:40,440
And I'm pretty sure I've even worn a shirt out here.

2911
02:40:41,320 --> 02:40:46,760
And not, not that I of course have any, I don't, I don't have any connection to any

2912
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:52,280
of these other shows except as a fan, but I do have some ideas of things that I think

2913
02:40:52,280 --> 02:40:54,920
could be kind of pretty fantastic.

2914
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:58,200
But we'll see if I can actually get in touch with people and make things happen.

2915
02:40:58,200 --> 02:40:58,440
Okay.

2916
02:40:58,440 --> 02:40:59,800
I'm like, I don't want to rip anything off.

2917
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:00,280
Certainly.

2918
02:41:00,280 --> 02:41:01,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2919
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:06,680
Certainly like no, no promises to speak of, but I consume a hell of a lot of content and

2920
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:10,360
you know, so many of these things take place in California anyway.

2921
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:14,280
So it's a little bit more doable and not just something by Skype.

2922
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:15,320
I have ideas.

2923
02:41:15,320 --> 02:41:21,320
Well, Hey, since we're on the topic, um, what video shows do you like other than Game Grumps?

2924
02:41:21,320 --> 02:41:23,560
Um, I like, I like Game Sack.

2925
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:28,840
Another one of my sources for news, like the first couple of times I did the intro is that,

2926
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:30,920
um, she goes by Dodger.

2927
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:32,360
She has two different channels.

2928
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:36,040
Uh, her gaming channel all the time is Press Heart to Continue.

2929
02:41:36,040 --> 02:41:41,400
And she does a news show on Saturday nights that I usually try to follow to take in more

2930
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:42,440
content as well.

2931
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:47,400
Uh, the Polaris Network, just in general, I drop in, see whatever videos catch my eye

2932
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:50,200
and then, and then, you know, move on to something else.

2933
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:53,400
Um, Game Grumps, uh, uh, uh, crap.

2934
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:54,360
What's his name?

2935
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:55,000
Gerard.

2936
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,440
Uh, JK completes it.

2937
02:41:56,440 --> 02:41:59,000
Um, Markiplier.

2938
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,880
I've been watching quite a, quite a lot of his stuff lately.

2939
02:42:01,880 --> 02:42:10,200
And I feel like, Oh, Continue show, um, does, uh, it not, not a let's play, not a review,

2940
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:15,720
but Hey, let's play a game and publish a video of the Memorial moments.

2941
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:19,640
30, 30 minutes or so of a game, uh, updates every Wednesday.

2942
02:42:19,640 --> 02:42:23,400
They've been there in, uh, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, uh, and they're pretty fun to

2943
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:23,880
watch too.

2944
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:26,920
So most of the stuff I like are the review ones, like classic game room.

2945
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:29,320
And, uh, I really like Game Sack.

2946
02:42:29,320 --> 02:42:31,720
They're a newer one and game theory.

2947
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:32,840
I don't watch anything.

2948
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:33,640
I don't, I really don't.

2949
02:42:33,640 --> 02:42:36,600
I actually, I actually do not watch review things.

2950
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:38,760
I watch like active content things.

2951
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:45,320
Every single person that I just named does plays a game and either voiceover afterwards

2952
02:42:45,320 --> 02:42:47,640
or running commentary while they're playing the game.

2953
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:52,040
And I just want to clarify, like, I just, I support indie broadcasting and people, you

2954
02:42:52,040 --> 02:42:54,440
know, doing it, but it's just like, I'm too busy.

2955
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:58,280
I like to do watch the stuff my friends do because a lot of my friends are doing live

2956
02:42:58,280 --> 02:42:58,520
streaming.

2957
02:42:58,520 --> 02:43:04,040
So I do a lot of that and I'm too busy producing, but to be honest, I think I honestly, I think

2958
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:05,480
of my favorites right now.

2959
02:43:05,480 --> 02:43:11,080
I'd really have to go for game theory because I like the fact that it breaks apart and analyzes.

2960
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:15,320
I did just catch that the other day because link dead one.

2961
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:19,160
No, uh, uh, Mario, uh, Mario's affliction.

2962
02:43:19,160 --> 02:43:23,080
I can't remember the name, but basically the fact that he's actually kind of the antihero

2963
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:26,280
in like the, the legitimate lore and everything in my universe.

2964
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:31,240
So anyway, um, to go ahead and close up this email, since that was the last thing that's

2965
02:43:31,240 --> 02:43:31,480
it.

2966
02:43:31,480 --> 02:43:32,040
Have a good night.

2967
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:32,920
The nasty canasta.

2968
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:35,480
Oh, and here for nasty canasta.

2969
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:43,480
This is Conga for BeatMania 2DX4 style by Good Cool.

2970
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:46,680
Yeah, I told you I have something better.

2971
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:48,040
This one's fun to play too.

2972
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:49,080
Nasty canasta.

2973
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:51,080
All right.

2974
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:52,120
Anyhow.

2975
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:52,920
Ha.

2976
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:54,760
See, I'm not the only one that likes game theory.

2977
02:43:55,400 --> 02:44:00,440
I tried it one time while back to mix conga and conga feeling together.

2978
02:44:00,440 --> 02:44:01,160
It doesn't work.

2979
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:01,880
It doesn't work.

2980
02:44:01,880 --> 02:44:02,600
It doesn't work.

2981
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:03,880
I miss your remixes, Loki.

2982
02:44:05,960 --> 02:44:06,200
All right.

2983
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:07,000
Is that it for emails?

2984
02:44:07,560 --> 02:44:07,880
Yes.

2985
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:08,760
Oh, well then there you go.

2986
02:44:08,760 --> 02:44:10,600
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com.

2987
02:44:10,600 --> 02:44:12,520
Now he's busy with genetic mixes.

2988
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:17,480
Is the place to mailbag at orangelauntrader.com is the place to send emails.

2989
02:44:17,480 --> 02:44:18,760
That would be fantastic.

2990
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:24,520
In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week because, you know, we're angsty

2991
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:25,160
some of the time.

2992
02:44:25,720 --> 02:44:26,440
A lot of the time.

2993
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:27,800
All the time.

2994
02:44:42,520 --> 02:44:49,160
So I have to do a little bit of a story and then, um, I will say a big FU to this jerkface.

2995
02:44:49,720 --> 02:44:53,880
I was going to target and some people on my Facebook and Tumblr know about this.

2996
02:44:53,880 --> 02:44:57,960
So I was going to target and there's this big guy just smoking in front of the door,

2997
02:44:57,960 --> 02:44:58,840
blocking the path.

2998
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:01,480
And I was like, eh.

2999
02:45:01,480 --> 02:45:04,840
So I tried to walk around him and he kept putting himself in my way.

3000
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:07,560
So I just scooted on around cause I'm shorter and faster.

3001
02:45:07,560 --> 02:45:10,600
And he tried to grab my arm going into the target.

3002
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:12,040
And I mean, this guy's bigger than Dan.

3003
02:45:13,160 --> 02:45:15,400
I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm about to go off.

3004
02:45:15,400 --> 02:45:16,360
So finish your story.

3005
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:20,280
Well, and he speaks in this whiskey voice, you know, the whiskey chain smoker voice.

3006
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:25,800
And then, so he tries to grab my arm and I pulled back and I said, I meant to say Neanderthal

3007
02:45:25,800 --> 02:45:29,880
and I called him Neolithic, but I said, don't touch me, you Neolithic sack of shit.

3008
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:36,840
Because I was by that point angry because someone trying to grab me is illegal.

3009
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:41,160
Apart from that, it's something that sets me off immediately.

3010
02:45:41,160 --> 02:45:42,280
Who, who does that?

3011
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:44,360
This is not high school.

3012
02:45:44,360 --> 02:45:45,240
This is not a bully.

3013
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:46,520
This is an adult.

3014
02:45:46,520 --> 02:45:50,360
You don't grab somebody at random outside of target.

3015
02:45:50,360 --> 02:45:56,200
To quote my friend who I discussed this with, she's like, he's the type of person who thinks

3016
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:57,160
that women are property.

3017
02:45:58,760 --> 02:46:00,760
It's, it's, it's disgusting.

3018
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:06,440
So just going into this, basically what happens that by the time I got inside the building,

3019
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:09,640
after I said this to him, I just kept dashing back on into the building.

3020
02:46:09,640 --> 02:46:12,200
He is going to get maced and good.

3021
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:15,480
He is going to, he's going to grab the wrong person and he is going to be maced.

3022
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:18,040
Well, I'm going to tell you just knowing the way that I react to things.

3023
02:46:18,040 --> 02:46:24,600
Had he touched me, I probably would have completely lost my shit because I, without going into

3024
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:30,520
too much detail about my own past, I have lost my shit before when someone grabbed me

3025
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:32,440
and it didn't end pretty anyway.

3026
02:46:32,440 --> 02:46:33,080
Oh, sorry.

3027
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:34,920
I didn't loop the FU is okay.

3028
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:39,880
So, so I was too busy being, and I'm short enough and he's tall enough that if I had,

3029
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:40,280
I punched him.

3030
02:46:40,280 --> 02:46:41,160
I would have punched him in the deck.

3031
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:46,120
So anyway, so I, I scooted inside target and he's yelling after me.

3032
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:48,120
Come back here, midget.

3033
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:53,560
But that's all he could say.

3034
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:57,960
And I was like, and it just, I, cause I was so angry and so worked up.

3035
02:46:57,960 --> 02:46:59,560
I would have called the police.

3036
02:46:59,560 --> 02:47:03,960
Actually, if I had been with you, I, Oh, it would have gone down as a target parking lot.

3037
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:06,360
Well, I, let's put it this way.

3038
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:12,360
I was, I was so worked up and so angry and so fucking close to a full-blown meltdown

3039
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:15,480
that I let it out the only way I could think of, which was hysterical laughter.

3040
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:18,040
Just laughing my ass off.

3041
02:47:18,040 --> 02:47:20,760
And this guy outside of here, he goes, man, she's laughing at you.

3042
02:47:20,760 --> 02:47:23,000
And he's like, come back here midget are you laughing at me?

3043
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:26,920
I was like, that's better is almost better than the physical punching in the deck because

3044
02:47:27,880 --> 02:47:29,480
I publicly, you know, humiliated him.

3045
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:30,440
And that was pretty funny too.

3046
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:34,520
So, um, so, and thank you, Alan.

3047
02:47:34,520 --> 02:47:35,000
I love you.

3048
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:37,800
You said, um, it's because dark soccer had the ball to be a woman in public.

3049
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:44,920
So basically once I calmed down and had a fun conversation with the lady in the sock department

3050
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:47,880
and you know how she's like, yeah, I saw him out there.

3051
02:47:47,880 --> 02:47:50,680
I tried to teach my son never to be like that.

3052
02:47:50,680 --> 02:47:52,040
And I was like, bless you.

3053
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:55,720
You know, and they ended up escorting the guys off the property.

3054
02:47:55,720 --> 02:48:00,200
And I think they did the cops, but I stayed inside the Walmart, not Walmart, the target

3055
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:02,360
for a solid hour.

3056
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:05,640
And you know, what was even worse about that is that the Hanukkah stuff wasn't on sale yet.

3057
02:48:07,960 --> 02:48:12,760
So anyway, so I just ended up just wandering around and looking at stuff and looking at

3058
02:48:12,760 --> 02:48:17,320
toys and playing on the internet on my phone and finally left.

3059
02:48:17,320 --> 02:48:22,040
And though I have to say that leaving the place is like that sort of, there's like a

3060
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:26,760
layer of calm that comes when you're in that heightened state where you observe everything

3061
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:29,400
and nothing escapes attention.

3062
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:31,880
I've gotten in my car and the freak out started happening.

3063
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:35,160
And by the time I got home, I was in full blown freak out mode.

3064
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:37,560
I could barely say anything to anybody.

3065
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:39,640
And even the cat wouldn't come near me.

3066
02:48:39,640 --> 02:48:41,560
And when Dan came home, I just lost my shit.

3067
02:48:41,560 --> 02:48:49,320
So, but in that situation, no, fuck him and fuck every man like him in the universe.

3068
02:48:49,320 --> 02:48:50,520
This is why we need feminism.

3069
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:53,240
Moving on Loki.

3070
02:48:54,040 --> 02:48:54,680
All right.

3071
02:48:54,680 --> 02:48:55,880
Well, I only have one.

3072
02:48:55,880 --> 02:48:59,720
That's the fact I have to get my wisdom teeth out.

3073
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:00,920
Damn it.

3074
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:02,920
I thought I was determined to be wise.

3075
02:49:08,200 --> 02:49:10,120
I don't really have a lot to F you.

3076
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:13,480
So F you to my snacking habit is out of control.

3077
02:49:14,360 --> 02:49:15,480
Do you like your candy cane?

3078
02:49:15,480 --> 02:49:15,960
I did.

3079
02:49:15,960 --> 02:49:19,240
I ate the whole damn thing because I have a habit.

3080
02:49:19,240 --> 02:49:19,880
I love food.

3081
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:24,760
Jason, I had one sometime this week, but I had a really good week.

3082
02:49:24,760 --> 02:49:25,560
I'm not angsty.

3083
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:28,920
F you to Jason for not having angst.

3084
02:49:29,720 --> 02:49:30,040
All right.

3085
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:35,720
Uh, just a couple of just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line

3086
02:49:35,720 --> 02:49:40,040
at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

3087
02:49:40,040 --> 02:49:41,240
Let's try to run through these quick.

3088
02:49:41,240 --> 02:49:41,800
All right.

3089
02:49:41,800 --> 02:49:48,360
So Tari, maybe on the back or coming back, uh, they have finally, um, received court

3090
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:50,680
approval to come out of bankruptcy.

3091
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:57,320
Um, they, I guess they have a payment plan now that involves a payback at 3.8 million

3092
02:49:57,320 --> 02:49:59,560
owned to the bankruptcy lender.

3093
02:49:59,640 --> 02:50:04,280
And, uh, once they have that and they're operating on their own, they can start paying, I guess,

3094
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:10,760
1.75 million to, um, you know, different creditors over the course of three years.

3095
02:50:10,760 --> 02:50:16,680
And, uh, apparently that's a small portion of the over 10 million that they're owned.

3096
02:50:16,680 --> 02:50:19,080
Um, but Hey, that'd be good.

3097
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:22,680
Cause, uh, at least it's not a studio, another studio going under.

3098
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:26,840
Maybe they'll make another aluminum, the dark game.

3099
02:50:26,920 --> 02:50:28,040
Oh, it's a this crap.

3100
02:50:30,600 --> 02:50:31,160
All right.

3101
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:33,000
Uh, well, good luck to Atari.

3102
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:33,400
All right.

3103
02:50:33,400 --> 02:50:35,000
Uh, one other story for you guys.

3104
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,960
And as I promised, we would do a story about pornography.

3105
02:50:37,960 --> 02:50:42,440
And, uh, this is a story from a website that really needs to consider their ad model because

3106
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:43,560
it's just annoying.

3107
02:50:43,560 --> 02:50:46,200
And, uh, this is why people get ad blockers destructoid.

3108
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:52,120
But anyway, destructoid ran this story about, uh, what Pornhub, uh, had to say about, uh,

3109
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:55,080
pornography on the various consoles that are out there.

3110
02:50:55,080 --> 02:50:59,640
And a destructoid actually called Pornhub or emailed or whatever people do to talk to

3111
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:00,360
each other.

3112
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:06,360
And, uh, the Pornhub vice president, Corey Price, I don't know what he's vice president

3113
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:07,480
of, I guess just porn.

3114
02:51:07,480 --> 02:51:11,640
Uh, so the vice president of porn said, quote, Pornhub is targeting consoles for website

3115
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:15,240
support because that is where some of our users today prefer to access our site.

3116
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:18,760
And our aim is to offer a great user experience across all platforms.

3117
02:51:19,320 --> 02:51:23,160
Now, the stuff you really want to know, where are people watching their pornography?

3118
02:51:23,160 --> 02:51:28,440
Because you know, the PS3, the PS4, the Wii, the 360, they all can, you know, have the

3119
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:30,600
internet and therefore you can get porn on it.

3120
02:51:31,160 --> 02:51:34,200
Um, yes, a Nintendo console, the Wii can get porn.

3121
02:51:35,080 --> 02:51:41,000
Um, anyhow, so the majority of porn, Pornhub traffic comes from the PlayStation 3.

3122
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:45,560
55% of pornography comes from the PlayStation 3.

3123
02:51:45,560 --> 02:51:53,000
Uh, the Xbox 360 accounts for 39% and the Wii, as this website calls it, a limp

3124
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:53,320
6%.

3125
02:51:54,840 --> 02:51:57,240
That's just because have you tried internet on the land?

3126
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:58,440
It's awful.

3127
02:51:58,440 --> 02:51:59,000
So true.

3128
02:51:59,560 --> 02:52:01,800
And technically though, it does work though.

3129
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:03,160
What?

3130
02:52:03,160 --> 02:52:05,560
The internet on the way to bring up porn.

3131
02:52:05,560 --> 02:52:06,280
It does.

3132
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:07,000
I remember.

3133
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:07,960
We've done that.

3134
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:08,600
Yes.

3135
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:10,600
It was research purposes, of course.

3136
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:13,640
Anyway, so congratulations PlayStation 3.

3137
02:52:13,640 --> 02:52:16,200
You are the Kings and Queens of pornography.

3138
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:16,700
Yay.

3139
02:52:17,640 --> 02:52:20,440
Let's go to the phones at one eight seven seven game.

3140
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,880
Or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

3141
02:52:23,880 --> 02:52:24,280
Hello.

3142
02:52:24,280 --> 02:52:25,400
You're on orange launch radio.

3143
02:52:25,400 --> 02:52:25,880
Who's this?

3144
02:52:26,600 --> 02:52:27,240
Am I now?

3145
02:52:27,800 --> 02:52:28,920
This is Y Y R.

3146
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:29,640
Hi, you're on.

3147
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:31,000
Greetings and salutations.

3148
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:31,960
And I love your shirt.

3149
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:33,000
This is video.

3150
02:52:34,520 --> 02:52:35,880
We're getting a video call.

3151
02:52:35,880 --> 02:52:36,840
Are you seeing this?

3152
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:38,120
Did you see it zoom in?

3153
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:39,000
Yeah, like zoom.

3154
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,600
This is an Xbox call, isn't it?

3155
02:52:41,320 --> 02:52:43,800
Yes, this is I'm calling you for my Xbox one.

3156
02:52:43,800 --> 02:52:49,640
And now let me show you basically either one of the coolest or most creepy things that

3157
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:53,080
the Xbox one will do as you say, God is following you.

3158
02:52:53,800 --> 02:52:55,320
Yes, it is following me.

3159
02:52:55,320 --> 02:52:57,080
It will follow you around the room.

3160
02:52:57,080 --> 02:53:00,360
It will basically like, if you walk out of view, it's going to be like confused.

3161
02:53:00,360 --> 02:53:01,400
Oh God, where did he go?

3162
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:01,880
Oh my God.

3163
02:53:01,880 --> 02:53:04,520
It's how clean that mess up off your table.

3164
02:53:04,520 --> 02:53:06,120
It's going to zoom in on my face.

3165
02:53:06,120 --> 02:53:06,680
Sorry.

3166
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:07,240
That's all right.

3167
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:10,600
Give me some wheat thins, bro.

3168
02:53:13,560 --> 02:53:16,360
You cannot have my wheat thins.

3169
02:53:16,360 --> 02:53:16,860
All right.

3170
02:53:17,420 --> 02:53:18,780
Well, congratulations.

3171
02:53:18,780 --> 02:53:18,940
Why?

3172
02:53:18,940 --> 02:53:24,460
Why are you are the first, uh, Xbox one caller to the call to the show.

3173
02:53:24,460 --> 02:53:26,060
So can I, can I troll you?

3174
02:53:26,940 --> 02:53:27,500
I'm sorry.

3175
02:53:27,500 --> 02:53:29,420
You have to see my messy living room.

3176
02:53:29,420 --> 02:53:34,140
I was actually thinking about cleaning it up or this call, but that's all right.

3177
02:53:34,140 --> 02:53:34,460
Wait, wait.

3178
02:53:34,460 --> 02:53:35,580
Can I try something real quick?

3179
02:53:35,580 --> 02:53:37,100
Why do I try something real quick?

3180
02:53:37,100 --> 02:53:37,660
Okay, hold on.

3181
02:53:38,300 --> 02:53:40,300
Xbox power down.

3182
02:53:41,500 --> 02:53:45,420
No, by the way, it's not power down.

3183
02:53:45,420 --> 02:53:47,660
Oh, it's turn off now.

3184
02:53:47,660 --> 02:53:48,780
Xbox turn off.

3185
02:53:50,060 --> 02:53:51,580
Don't listen to rob Xbox.

3186
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:54,060
He'll deceive you every time.

3187
02:53:54,060 --> 02:53:55,180
He'll lead you astray.

3188
02:53:55,900 --> 02:53:56,300
All right.

3189
02:53:56,300 --> 02:53:57,420
No, it's interesting.

3190
02:53:57,420 --> 02:54:02,860
I actually have a feeling that it somehow can differentiate between voices in the room

3191
02:54:02,860 --> 02:54:09,580
and voices from the speaker because my girlfriend already tried this and it didn't work out

3192
02:54:09,580 --> 02:54:10,460
all that well.

3193
02:54:10,460 --> 02:54:11,340
Didn't work out.

3194
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:14,940
So you're, uh, making Xbox one video calls to your girlfriend, huh?

3195
02:54:15,820 --> 02:54:17,740
Uh, yes, actually what's interesting.

3196
02:54:17,740 --> 02:54:22,060
Um, I was cleaning up my place for the last two days and listening to the last two weeks

3197
02:54:22,060 --> 02:54:23,260
worth of OLR.

3198
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:25,740
And I see you mentioned that you're in San Francisco a lot.

3199
02:54:25,740 --> 02:54:26,780
Well, guess where she lives?

3200
02:54:27,420 --> 02:54:28,380
San Francisco.

3201
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:33,420
So, uh, we may, depending on what happens, we may need to make some plans to, you know,

3202
02:54:33,420 --> 02:54:36,380
me chill out because she's actually listening right now.

3203
02:54:36,380 --> 02:54:37,740
So she'll know who you are.

3204
02:54:37,740 --> 02:54:39,500
Do you, oh, well, howdy.

3205
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:41,500
Where, where, when are you coming to San Francisco?

3206
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:45,180
Cause, cause our, our buddy Jason is in San Francisco for the holidays.

3207
02:54:46,060 --> 02:54:50,780
Oh, well, I mean, I'm going to visit her for a few days on the 19th, but I'm not sticking

3208
02:54:50,780 --> 02:54:51,660
around for very long.

3209
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:55,100
Cause I'm, I basically used up all of my vacation this year.

3210
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:55,820
Nope.

3211
02:54:55,820 --> 02:54:57,980
Well, uh, look, look up VX chase next week.

3212
02:54:57,980 --> 02:54:58,940
Cause he's in us.

3213
02:54:58,940 --> 02:55:00,220
He's said Seattle.

3214
02:55:00,220 --> 02:55:00,780
What the hell?

3215
02:55:00,780 --> 02:55:02,220
He's in San Francisco right now.

3216
02:55:02,220 --> 02:55:03,180
Keep in touch anyways.

3217
02:55:03,180 --> 02:55:04,380
Let's see if we can work something out.

3218
02:55:04,380 --> 02:55:04,780
There you go.

3219
02:55:05,660 --> 02:55:06,620
That's cool.

3220
02:55:06,620 --> 02:55:11,180
So I'm listening to OLR over the weekend and by the way, um, how's the audio?

3221
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:11,820
Is it coming through?

3222
02:55:11,820 --> 02:55:12,300
Okay.

3223
02:55:12,300 --> 02:55:12,780
It's good.

3224
02:55:13,340 --> 02:55:17,660
You can tell that your, your microphone, like you're not talking into a microphone that

3225
02:55:17,660 --> 02:55:21,180
it's like a room microphone that has a big gate, but it's, it's fine.

3226
02:55:21,180 --> 02:55:22,060
It's, it's good enough.

3227
02:55:22,060 --> 02:55:22,380
Okay.

3228
02:55:22,380 --> 02:55:24,060
So I shouldn't try plugging this in.

3229
02:55:24,700 --> 02:55:27,180
I'd be curious just to see what the quality difference is.

3230
02:55:28,060 --> 02:55:28,300
Okay.

3231
02:55:28,300 --> 02:55:28,940
Well, you know what?

3232
02:55:28,940 --> 02:55:31,020
I'll plug in my, uh, a little mic here.

3233
02:55:31,020 --> 02:55:32,940
He's plugging in a little microservices.

3234
02:55:32,940 --> 02:55:34,140
Is there still a radio show?

3235
02:55:34,140 --> 02:55:37,260
We might all be looking at video, but I know the podcast listeners can't see it.

3236
02:55:37,260 --> 02:55:37,660
Okay.

3237
02:55:37,660 --> 02:55:38,780
Uh, can you hear me now?

3238
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:39,660
Oh, that sounds okay.

3239
02:55:39,660 --> 02:55:41,340
That sounds like a normal call now.

3240
02:55:41,340 --> 02:55:41,820
Yeah.

3241
02:55:41,820 --> 02:55:43,100
I think I lost you.

3242
02:55:43,100 --> 02:55:43,740
No, we're here.

3243
02:55:43,740 --> 02:55:44,700
Hi, still there.

3244
02:55:44,700 --> 02:55:45,020
Yes.

3245
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:45,740
You sound great.

3246
02:55:45,740 --> 02:55:46,700
So talk.

3247
02:55:46,700 --> 02:55:47,340
God damn it.

3248
02:55:48,140 --> 02:55:50,140
And this become old can't became a one week.

3249
02:55:50,140 --> 02:55:50,940
Oh my God.

3250
02:55:50,940 --> 02:55:54,620
Yeah, that's too bad because he sounds better on that thing.

3251
02:55:54,620 --> 02:55:59,900
I had to suppress the urge to reach out my hand and say, turn the volume up in sign language,

3252
02:55:59,900 --> 02:56:00,940
but we don't have a camera.

3253
02:56:00,940 --> 02:56:01,900
We don't have a cam in here.

3254
02:56:01,900 --> 02:56:03,260
Maybe I need to go get one.

3255
02:56:03,260 --> 02:56:03,580
What are you?

3256
02:56:03,580 --> 02:56:08,220
He's pressing buttons and I see the lights in his room, like fluctuating, like he's

3257
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:09,980
running through different screens.

3258
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:10,300
All right.

3259
02:56:10,300 --> 02:56:11,340
Well, I just thought plugged it.

3260
02:56:11,420 --> 02:56:12,380
Can you hear me now?

3261
02:56:12,380 --> 02:56:12,620
Yeah.

3262
02:56:12,620 --> 02:56:14,940
We could actually hear you before and you sounded great.

3263
02:56:14,940 --> 02:56:15,420
Yeah.

3264
02:56:15,420 --> 02:56:16,060
Huh?

3265
02:56:16,060 --> 02:56:17,500
Now he can't hear us at all.

3266
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:18,540
You lost it entirely.

3267
02:56:20,140 --> 02:56:21,260
This is exciting.

3268
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:21,900
Why?

3269
02:56:21,900 --> 02:56:22,380
Uh, maybe.

3270
02:56:22,380 --> 02:56:23,180
Oh, you don't know what else?

3271
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:23,740
Let's see.

3272
02:56:23,740 --> 02:56:23,980
Okay.

3273
02:56:23,980 --> 02:56:24,540
He hung up.

3274
02:56:27,740 --> 02:56:29,820
Xbox one y'all wave of the future.

3275
02:56:31,180 --> 02:56:31,900
He's calling back.

3276
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:32,780
Okay.

3277
02:56:32,780 --> 02:56:33,900
He's calling back right now.

3278
02:56:37,500 --> 02:56:40,140
Well, I would have to say that was absolutely a success.

3279
02:56:41,660 --> 02:56:44,060
We can hear you fine that whole time.

3280
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:44,780
Just so you know.

3281
02:56:44,780 --> 02:56:45,420
Oh, really?

3282
02:56:45,420 --> 02:56:45,660
Yes.

3283
02:56:46,940 --> 02:56:47,180
Yeah.

3284
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:50,380
Because the, yeah, I absolutely stopped hearing you.

3285
02:56:50,380 --> 02:56:53,580
I tried unplugging the mic and I still couldn't hear you.

3286
02:56:53,580 --> 02:56:55,660
So yeah, that didn't work out so well.

3287
02:56:55,660 --> 02:56:58,780
Just $4.99 at your local Walmart or Target.

3288
02:56:58,780 --> 02:57:01,020
$499 US dollars.

3289
02:57:02,060 --> 02:57:02,860
All right.

3290
02:57:02,860 --> 02:57:03,740
What else is on your mind?

3291
02:57:03,740 --> 02:57:05,260
You send an email to the show, right?

3292
02:57:05,900 --> 02:57:06,140
Yeah.

3293
02:57:06,140 --> 02:57:10,940
Basically after listening, you know, I'm listening to a six, seven hours worth of

3294
02:57:11,580 --> 02:57:15,100
and of course there were a few times when I'm just like, oh, I wish I was in chat so I

3295
02:57:15,100 --> 02:57:16,700
could respond to things.

3296
02:57:16,700 --> 02:57:19,900
But there were three things in particular that I wanted to bring up.

3297
02:57:21,580 --> 02:57:26,220
The subject of the discontinuation of spot pass service for swap note was brought up

3298
02:57:26,220 --> 02:57:28,300
at least four separate times.

3299
02:57:28,300 --> 02:57:28,620
Okay.

3300
02:57:29,500 --> 02:57:31,900
And I wanted to throw in my two cents on that.

3301
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:36,540
And because at first I thought also, why, why did they do that?

3302
02:57:36,540 --> 02:57:40,140
Why couldn't they just drop the photo feature and leave the rest of it intact?

3303
02:57:40,940 --> 02:57:47,420
But I thought about it for a while and then I understood this had to be done because swap

3304
02:57:47,420 --> 02:57:55,660
note, unfortunately put kids and teens in touch with people who could, you know, take

3305
02:57:55,660 --> 02:57:57,660
their pictures and do bad things with them.

3306
02:57:58,460 --> 02:58:05,340
And if they had just dropped the photo feature, it would have left these kids and teens with

3307
02:58:05,340 --> 02:58:07,980
a way to communicate with their potential abusers.

3308
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:12,540
At which point the potential abusers could just say, oh, well now send your pictures

3309
02:58:12,540 --> 02:58:16,460
to this email address or send your pictures to this phone or things like that.

3310
02:58:16,460 --> 02:58:23,020
It could have gone from there by completely pulling the plug that, you know, kills that

3311
02:58:23,020 --> 02:58:23,660
idea.

3312
02:58:23,660 --> 02:58:24,380
It stops it.

3313
02:58:25,820 --> 02:58:30,860
My biggest problem though, YYR is that, that why are kids, how come the kids are talking

3314
02:58:30,860 --> 02:58:33,020
to these people unsupervised in the first place?

3315
02:58:33,020 --> 02:58:37,660
Like, you know, if, if a parent is concerned about it, why is, why is swap note even being

3316
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:38,780
downloaded in the first place?

3317
02:58:38,780 --> 02:58:42,860
I think if the parents were more involved, then you wouldn't have this happen.

3318
02:58:42,860 --> 02:58:47,900
And it, this isn't something that's, I mean, this is horrible and we do need to stop predators

3319
02:58:47,900 --> 02:58:49,500
from predating on children.

3320
02:58:49,500 --> 02:58:55,100
But disabled, disabling swap note is not going to do that because there's always email, there's

3321
02:58:55,100 --> 02:58:56,380
always the internet and other forms.

3322
02:58:56,380 --> 02:58:58,060
They found each other somehow.

3323
02:58:58,060 --> 02:59:04,540
So I just kind of feel like, you know, well, why, I don't understand.

3324
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:05,660
So it strikes me as a parent.

3325
02:59:05,660 --> 02:59:07,660
You are absolutely preaching to the choir.

3326
02:59:07,660 --> 02:59:12,220
I completely agree with you that parents need to be more hands on about what their kids

3327
02:59:12,220 --> 02:59:13,180
and teens are doing.

3328
02:59:13,180 --> 02:59:17,180
But for the moments that they're not, you know, Nintendo being as family friendly as

3329
02:59:17,180 --> 02:59:20,460
they want to be, that is what they chose to do.

3330
02:59:20,460 --> 02:59:22,460
And I, I understand it.

3331
02:59:22,460 --> 02:59:28,940
It sucks, but I can understand that decision because they needed to cut off the, you know,

3332
02:59:28,940 --> 02:59:30,700
the contact between these two parties.

3333
02:59:31,740 --> 02:59:36,220
It just, it just also further goes to show why we're never going to have video play on

3334
02:59:36,220 --> 02:59:37,180
the virtual console.

3335
02:59:37,180 --> 02:59:40,300
And I just think that's the wrong direction for Nintendo in general.

3336
02:59:40,300 --> 02:59:41,900
It just, it sucks for the rest of us.

3337
02:59:41,900 --> 02:59:44,140
And I, yeah, it does.

3338
02:59:44,140 --> 02:59:44,940
But you know what?

3339
02:59:44,940 --> 02:59:47,020
I think that just comes with the territory.

3340
02:59:47,020 --> 02:59:49,500
I was, you know, gaming on a Nintendo platform.

3341
02:59:50,220 --> 02:59:52,460
We're just going to have to do those things on other platforms.

3342
02:59:53,740 --> 02:59:58,140
Well, I think Nintendo's other thing too is that just because a parent should do something,

3343
02:59:58,140 --> 03:00:00,700
they know not all parents will do something.

3344
03:00:00,700 --> 03:00:02,860
So it keeps their reputation safe.

3345
03:00:03,420 --> 03:00:05,180
They have their brand to look after.

3346
03:00:05,180 --> 03:00:05,980
Exactly.

3347
03:00:05,980 --> 03:00:06,540
Exactly.

3348
03:00:07,900 --> 03:00:12,940
So the, anyway, the second thing I wanted to bring up was Forza 5 microtransactions.

3349
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:16,860
You know, it seems like you guys don't think it's a really big deal, but I'm going to give

3350
03:00:16,860 --> 03:00:20,140
you three reasons why folks are up in arms about it.

3351
03:00:20,860 --> 03:00:26,460
Number one, in older Forza games, by playing through the game and completing the challenges

3352
03:00:26,460 --> 03:00:29,980
or whatever, occasionally you would get cars for free.

3353
03:00:29,980 --> 03:00:32,620
Hey, you cleared this thing, you get this car.

3354
03:00:32,620 --> 03:00:34,700
They don't do that anymore in 5.

3355
03:00:35,340 --> 03:00:42,780
You cannot earn cars by any means except buying them with credits or tokens, except for the

3356
03:00:42,780 --> 03:00:46,460
very first car you get when you start the game, because how can you drive without one?

3357
03:00:46,940 --> 03:00:51,100
So it's not like what we were just saying about Gran Turismo 6, where you just unlock

3358
03:00:51,100 --> 03:00:52,140
them through the course of the story.

3359
03:00:52,140 --> 03:00:55,180
Anyway, I had the impression that these two games are in very similar boats.

3360
03:00:56,540 --> 03:00:58,860
You have to buy all of the cars now.

3361
03:00:58,860 --> 03:01:00,380
At least that's what I've read online.

3362
03:01:00,380 --> 03:01:02,140
I just started playing the game myself.

3363
03:01:02,140 --> 03:01:06,060
I haven't really gotten to, you know, a point where I would want to buy another car yet.

3364
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:10,780
But from what I've been reading in Amazon reviews and Game Facts posts and other places,

3365
03:01:10,780 --> 03:01:14,460
there are no free cars anymore except the one you get at the start.

3366
03:01:14,460 --> 03:01:15,980
You have to buy everything.

3367
03:01:16,060 --> 03:01:18,220
Now, ready for your mind to be blown?

3368
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:21,260
This is how DLC cars work.

3369
03:01:21,260 --> 03:01:22,460
This is item number two.

3370
03:01:23,580 --> 03:01:25,900
You pay real money for the DLC, yes?

3371
03:01:28,060 --> 03:01:33,980
When you do this, this adds the cars to the game, but you cannot actually drive the cars

3372
03:01:33,980 --> 03:01:36,700
until you buy them from the in-game shop.

3373
03:01:39,260 --> 03:01:43,260
And if you don't have enough credits to do that, you get to open your wallet again and

3374
03:01:43,260 --> 03:01:45,980
essentially pay twice to use these cars.

3375
03:01:47,100 --> 03:01:47,600
Huh.

3376
03:01:48,540 --> 03:01:49,040
Yep.

3377
03:01:49,980 --> 03:01:50,780
I'm waiting.

3378
03:01:50,780 --> 03:01:54,460
I'm really hoping somebody in the chat room here is going to jump in and say you're wrong.

3379
03:01:54,460 --> 03:01:55,980
Like, no offense, but I just-

3380
03:01:55,980 --> 03:01:57,180
I would hope so too.

3381
03:01:57,180 --> 03:01:58,140
That would be great.

3382
03:01:58,140 --> 03:02:00,140
I hope someone tells me that.

3383
03:02:00,140 --> 03:02:03,740
Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf went to bed, and I know he's been playing the game, so-

3384
03:02:03,740 --> 03:02:05,500
He said the exact same thing, though, on his show.

3385
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:05,980
Really?

3386
03:02:05,980 --> 03:02:06,380
I want to say, yeah.

3387
03:02:08,060 --> 03:02:10,620
Well, you know, here's the thing.

3388
03:02:10,620 --> 03:02:15,100
Number three item, which basically makes one and two worse, is credits are earned slower

3389
03:02:15,100 --> 03:02:17,580
in the game than they were in Forza 4, so-

3390
03:02:17,580 --> 03:02:24,700
I will give this little thing, and that is that, okay, well, there's a lot of DLC that

3391
03:02:24,700 --> 03:02:29,740
you download that you can't really play until you get to a certain point in the game, but

3392
03:02:29,740 --> 03:02:33,900
I don't know, something just seems really, really tacky about it.

3393
03:02:33,900 --> 03:02:34,620
Super tacky.

3394
03:02:34,620 --> 03:02:37,820
DKBeast in chat at live.vognetware.com says he's not wrong.

3395
03:02:37,820 --> 03:02:39,420
Wow.

3396
03:02:39,420 --> 03:02:42,300
Yeah, I was really hoping I would be, but no.

3397
03:02:43,020 --> 03:02:45,420
And the developer has responded.

3398
03:02:45,420 --> 03:02:50,700
Basically what happened was if someone bought, like, one of the most expensive cars early

3399
03:02:50,700 --> 03:02:53,660
on, they give you a free other car.

3400
03:02:53,660 --> 03:02:57,740
If not, they give you that car for free, but in order to get in on this, you had to buy

3401
03:02:57,740 --> 03:03:01,340
the game at launch and join their, like, Forza rewards program or whatever.

3402
03:03:01,340 --> 03:03:02,380
I don't know what that is.

3403
03:03:02,380 --> 03:03:02,700
Wow.

3404
03:03:03,820 --> 03:03:07,420
So it's a mess, and I really don't like this whole-

3405
03:03:07,420 --> 03:03:11,340
you bought a $60 game, now we'll throw free-to-play type elements into it.

3406
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:14,780
It's something I hope doesn't last too long.

3407
03:03:14,780 --> 03:03:15,980
I really hope so.

3408
03:03:15,980 --> 03:03:17,820
I hope people reject that.

3409
03:03:17,820 --> 03:03:19,180
Anyway, you said you had one more thing?

3410
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:25,100
The last point I wanted to make, on the subject of Loki being too harsh towards the new consoles,

3411
03:03:25,100 --> 03:03:26,300
no, I don't agree.

3412
03:03:26,300 --> 03:03:28,300
I don't think he was overly harsh at all.

3413
03:03:28,300 --> 03:03:31,740
The fact of the matter is, the games aren't there yet.

3414
03:03:31,740 --> 03:03:36,060
I mean, I bought the next one because I want to be one of the first, you know,

3415
03:03:36,700 --> 03:03:41,580
developers who didn't get into the early program to put games on the system.

3416
03:03:41,580 --> 03:03:44,700
You know, I didn't buy it because I had to have it.

3417
03:03:44,700 --> 03:03:49,260
The game I've most been looking forward to playing is Peggle 2, and that comes out tomorrow.

3418
03:03:50,700 --> 03:03:51,200
Good choice.

3419
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:55,420
I got Forza 5, I got Dead Rising 3, they've mostly been sitting there.

3420
03:03:56,220 --> 03:04:00,300
So it's like, you know, the Skype thing is cool.

3421
03:04:00,300 --> 03:04:03,020
The TV features are neat, but I don't use most of them.

3422
03:04:03,020 --> 03:04:09,660
I just, you know, it's cool to be able to say, okay, watch CNN or watch Comedy Central

3423
03:04:09,660 --> 03:04:13,740
or whatever, and the Xbox One will push the buttons on your cable box for you.

3424
03:04:14,460 --> 03:04:17,180
And again, this call coming from an Xbox One.

3425
03:04:18,300 --> 03:04:22,620
It's cute, you know, it's nice, but it's not a have-to-have kind of thing.

3426
03:04:22,620 --> 03:04:26,380
There's no real reason, in my opinion, to own one of these boxes right now.

3427
03:04:26,380 --> 03:04:26,780
Wow.

3428
03:04:26,780 --> 03:04:28,940
And there's no real reason to own a PS4.

3429
03:04:29,820 --> 03:04:30,620
Not yet.

3430
03:04:30,620 --> 03:04:32,060
The games aren't there yet.

3431
03:04:32,060 --> 03:04:32,540
Not yet.

3432
03:04:33,100 --> 03:04:33,580
All right.

3433
03:04:33,580 --> 03:04:35,500
YYR, this has been a fantastic call.

3434
03:04:35,500 --> 03:04:35,980
I love this.

3435
03:04:35,980 --> 03:04:38,060
I got to let you go so we can get some more calls.

3436
03:04:38,060 --> 03:04:39,340
But thank you for demoing.

3437
03:04:39,340 --> 03:04:41,580
One quick thing, actually, yeah, really quick.

3438
03:04:42,140 --> 03:04:48,460
The last thing from PastoLR, Jamie said, Jamie pointed out that our society, our government,

3439
03:04:48,460 --> 03:04:51,180
and our healthcare systems don't give enough attention to mental health.

3440
03:04:51,740 --> 03:04:54,140
Probably the truest statement that ever was.

3441
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:56,380
This needs to be dealt with.

3442
03:04:56,380 --> 03:04:57,580
It needs to be looked into.

3443
03:04:57,580 --> 03:04:59,420
It needs to be focused on.

3444
03:04:59,420 --> 03:05:00,860
It's really important.

3445
03:05:00,860 --> 03:05:01,820
I agree with that.

3446
03:05:01,820 --> 03:05:02,380
Absolutely.

3447
03:05:02,940 --> 03:05:03,180
All right.

3448
03:05:03,180 --> 03:05:07,500
YYR, thank you so much for binge listening to OLR and then calling us from your Xbox

3449
03:05:07,500 --> 03:05:07,660
One.

3450
03:05:07,660 --> 03:05:08,780
I appreciate it.

3451
03:05:08,780 --> 03:05:09,900
And he was very well prepared.

3452
03:05:09,900 --> 03:05:11,180
Too much is never enough.

3453
03:05:11,180 --> 03:05:11,500
All right.

3454
03:05:11,500 --> 03:05:12,140
Take care, buddy.

3455
03:05:12,940 --> 03:05:13,500
You too.

3456
03:05:13,500 --> 03:05:13,820
Bye.

3457
03:05:14,460 --> 03:05:15,740
Always a pleasure to hear from him.

3458
03:05:15,740 --> 03:05:18,780
And that was a lot of fun to go to the Xbox One for the calls.

3459
03:05:18,780 --> 03:05:19,260
But whoa.

3460
03:05:20,220 --> 03:05:21,020
What the fuck was that?

3461
03:05:21,020 --> 03:05:22,220
Are we dialed into AOL?

3462
03:05:22,220 --> 03:05:23,020
Did somebody here-

3463
03:05:23,020 --> 03:05:24,220
Are we connected to a BBS?

3464
03:05:24,220 --> 03:05:25,020
Did somebody just-

3465
03:05:25,020 --> 03:05:25,980
Did we just call a fax machine?

3466
03:05:25,980 --> 03:05:28,060
Was that a fax machine that was calling us?

3467
03:05:28,060 --> 03:05:30,460
By the way, Rob, you know what's actually super funny?

3468
03:05:31,420 --> 03:05:33,980
Is that Tiara just beat Mass Effect 2.

3469
03:05:33,980 --> 03:05:34,220
Yeah.

3470
03:05:34,220 --> 03:05:35,580
And she romanced Garrus.

3471
03:05:35,580 --> 03:05:36,300
1877-

3472
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:38,300
Definitely sister after my own heart.

3473
03:05:38,300 --> 03:05:40,700
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.

3474
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:42,060
Orange Lounge Radio.

3475
03:05:42,060 --> 03:05:42,700
All one word.

3476
03:05:42,700 --> 03:05:44,220
But the phone is still ringing off the hook.

3477
03:05:44,220 --> 03:05:45,180
Let's go to it.

3478
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:46,220
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3479
03:05:46,220 --> 03:05:46,620
Who's this?

3480
03:05:48,060 --> 03:05:48,460
Second.

3481
03:05:48,460 --> 03:05:50,060
Trying to fix my- can you hear me?

3482
03:05:50,060 --> 03:05:50,780
Yes, we can hear you.

3483
03:05:50,780 --> 03:05:51,020
Hi.

3484
03:05:51,580 --> 03:05:52,780
I had to fix my iPhone.

3485
03:05:52,780 --> 03:05:55,900
Anyway, I just wanted to call real quickly about Danny Wells.

3486
03:05:55,900 --> 03:05:56,140
Yeah.

3487
03:05:56,140 --> 03:05:57,100
This guy's Judo, right?

3488
03:05:57,660 --> 03:05:57,900
Yeah.

3489
03:05:57,900 --> 03:05:58,380
Guy Judo.

3490
03:05:58,380 --> 03:05:58,700
Hey, buddy.

3491
03:05:58,700 --> 03:05:59,180
How you doing?

3492
03:06:00,060 --> 03:06:00,380
All right.

3493
03:06:01,260 --> 03:06:01,420
Yeah.

3494
03:06:01,420 --> 03:06:04,540
What I just wanted to mention was I didn't know him as Mario.

3495
03:06:04,540 --> 03:06:07,180
I knew him as the bartender on the Jeffersons.

3496
03:06:07,180 --> 03:06:09,340
That's where he's mostly known for me.

3497
03:06:09,340 --> 03:06:10,300
Oh, my God.

3498
03:06:10,300 --> 03:06:11,020
That's right.

3499
03:06:11,020 --> 03:06:12,140
He was, wasn't he?

3500
03:06:12,780 --> 03:06:12,940
Yeah.

3501
03:06:12,940 --> 03:06:14,860
He was Charlie on the Jeffersons for years.

3502
03:06:14,860 --> 03:06:18,620
So that's really where his notoriety comes from, you know?

3503
03:06:18,620 --> 03:06:21,340
So many talented people on that show are deceased.

3504
03:06:21,340 --> 03:06:24,220
You know, I mean, is anybody from that show?

3505
03:06:24,220 --> 03:06:26,620
I mean, I know we lost Sherman Helmsley.

3506
03:06:26,620 --> 03:06:28,700
We lost Roxy Roker a long time ago.

3507
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:31,260
I mean, there's so many people from that show that aren't around anymore.

3508
03:06:31,260 --> 03:06:33,660
I think Bentley might still be alive.

3509
03:06:33,660 --> 03:06:35,500
I think Florence is still alive, too.

3510
03:06:35,500 --> 03:06:36,140
Oh, yeah.

3511
03:06:36,140 --> 03:06:38,860
Florence is alive, but I think family's alive, too.

3512
03:06:39,740 --> 03:06:40,220
Not sure.

3513
03:06:40,860 --> 03:06:42,300
But yeah, that's where I knew him from.

3514
03:06:42,300 --> 03:06:44,620
And I was looking him up on IMDB.

3515
03:06:44,620 --> 03:06:45,500
I didn't even know that.

3516
03:06:45,500 --> 03:06:47,260
This is another video game related thing.

3517
03:06:47,260 --> 03:06:50,620
He did some voice acting for one of the Splinter Cell games.

3518
03:06:51,420 --> 03:06:53,420
So he's been connected with video games.

3519
03:06:53,420 --> 03:06:54,380
That's really cool.

3520
03:06:55,020 --> 03:06:58,380
Well, I like that you're recognizing him for things that

3521
03:06:58,620 --> 03:06:59,340
aren't just Luigi.

3522
03:06:59,340 --> 03:07:02,220
I mean, obviously, our community remembers him for that an awful lot.

3523
03:07:02,220 --> 03:07:03,500
But that's great.

3524
03:07:03,500 --> 03:07:05,900
That's some awesome little, like, trivia type stuff.

3525
03:07:05,900 --> 03:07:06,400
That's cool.

3526
03:07:07,020 --> 03:07:07,180
Yeah.

3527
03:07:07,180 --> 03:07:09,580
If you grew up in the 80s, I mean, you know that guy's face.

3528
03:07:09,580 --> 03:07:12,620
I mean, he's been like an extra on so many television shows.

3529
03:07:12,620 --> 03:07:16,140
He's always playing, like, some kind of slimy, carn-artist type of guy.

3530
03:07:16,780 --> 03:07:18,380
He just has one of those faces.

3531
03:07:18,380 --> 03:07:21,020
Well, plus, you know, I mentioned earlier in the show,

3532
03:07:21,020 --> 03:07:23,020
I binged on game shows a lot when I was a kid.

3533
03:07:23,020 --> 03:07:25,100
And what came on after game show binges?

3534
03:07:25,100 --> 03:07:26,460
The Jeffersons.

3535
03:07:26,940 --> 03:07:27,420
Moving on.

3536
03:07:28,220 --> 03:07:29,180
Freaking love that show.

3537
03:07:29,180 --> 03:07:30,380
Yeah, that show is great.

3538
03:07:30,380 --> 03:07:32,460
A spin-off of All in the Family.

3539
03:07:32,460 --> 03:07:34,380
Never realized that till years later.

3540
03:07:34,380 --> 03:07:36,860
Yeah, we could talk about TV for hours.

3541
03:07:36,860 --> 03:07:39,740
But yeah, All in the Family, we had so many freaking spin-offs.

3542
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:45,420
You can even count Good Times as a spin-off from All in the Family.

3543
03:07:45,420 --> 03:07:45,900
That's true.

3544
03:07:45,900 --> 03:07:51,580
Because the mother came from Maud, which was a spin-off of the All in the Family.

3545
03:07:51,900 --> 03:07:58,540
All right, we need to write all this down for Dark Sakura's future I'm a Nerd in 30 show.

3546
03:08:00,940 --> 03:08:03,980
You're gonna have an episode all about connections to All in the Family.

3547
03:08:05,980 --> 03:08:07,180
And one last thing.

3548
03:08:07,980 --> 03:08:12,460
When you guys mentioned the game show that let you run around and, like, pick video games.

3549
03:08:13,660 --> 03:08:17,260
I thought, at first, I thought you met this other game show that I love called,

3550
03:08:17,260 --> 03:08:19,580
it was like, it was a take-off of the new League of Legends game.

3551
03:08:19,580 --> 03:08:20,860
It was called I'm Telling.

3552
03:08:20,860 --> 03:08:22,300
We had, like, a brother and sister.

3553
03:08:22,300 --> 03:08:23,020
I remember that show.

3554
03:08:23,020 --> 03:08:24,060
That show is great.

3555
03:08:24,060 --> 03:08:26,300
Yes, that was great.

3556
03:08:26,300 --> 03:08:29,420
And they had a similar thing where they will let you run through a maze and, like,

3557
03:08:29,420 --> 03:08:34,140
you hit, like, this little siren thing to try to match with your brother or sister pick.

3558
03:08:34,140 --> 03:08:35,500
Then you would get all the prizes.

3559
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:36,380
That was just cool.

3560
03:08:36,380 --> 03:08:37,580
I so remember that.

3561
03:08:37,580 --> 03:08:40,860
And, like, because I was virtually, I mean, I do have a brother and a sister,

3562
03:08:40,860 --> 03:08:43,580
but they're 14 and 16 years older than me.

3563
03:08:43,580 --> 03:08:46,060
So I was kind of like an only child growing up.

3564
03:08:46,060 --> 03:08:49,340
And I always was like, I want somebody to go on this show with.

3565
03:08:49,340 --> 03:08:51,260
But, you know, it was never going to happen.

3566
03:08:51,260 --> 03:08:53,420
Yeah, they should have done a Friends edition.

3567
03:08:53,420 --> 03:08:54,860
That would have been, that would have worked.

3568
03:08:54,860 --> 03:08:55,340
Yeah.

3569
03:08:55,340 --> 03:08:55,980
Oh, yeah.

3570
03:08:55,980 --> 03:08:56,940
That's all I got for you.

3571
03:08:56,940 --> 03:08:58,780
Kaijuto, thanks for the walk down memory lane.

3572
03:08:58,780 --> 03:08:59,260
Appreciate it.

3573
03:08:59,260 --> 03:09:00,220
Have a good one.

3574
03:09:00,220 --> 03:09:00,460
All right.

3575
03:09:00,460 --> 03:09:00,860
You too.

3576
03:09:00,860 --> 03:09:01,180
All right.

3577
03:09:01,180 --> 03:09:01,900
Bye.

3578
03:09:01,900 --> 03:09:03,980
Great tribute to Danny Wells.

3579
03:09:03,980 --> 03:09:05,580
What about the other things Danny Wells did?

3580
03:09:05,580 --> 03:09:06,460
Those are great.

3581
03:09:06,460 --> 03:09:07,100
I love that.

3582
03:09:07,100 --> 03:09:10,140
You know Dark Soccer, 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype,

3583
03:09:10,140 --> 03:09:12,140
Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

3584
03:09:12,140 --> 03:09:15,900
You know, Dark Soccer, if you were to do a show like that,

3585
03:09:15,900 --> 03:09:17,740
like the nerd stuff and I'm 30 or whatever,

3586
03:09:17,740 --> 03:09:19,180
I could see in the theme song for you.

3587
03:09:20,220 --> 03:09:22,860
Those were the days.

3588
03:09:23,500 --> 03:09:24,220
Answer the phone.

3589
03:09:27,820 --> 03:09:28,780
We don't like my singing.

3590
03:09:28,780 --> 03:09:30,380
1877 Game OLR.

3591
03:09:30,380 --> 03:09:31,020
Oh, hi.

3592
03:09:31,020 --> 03:09:31,420
Hi.

3593
03:09:31,420 --> 03:09:32,620
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

3594
03:09:32,620 --> 03:09:33,420
Who's this?

3595
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:35,980
This is the one and only Ron McCalling from Brooklyn.

3596
03:09:35,980 --> 03:09:36,860
Hi, Rama.

3597
03:09:36,860 --> 03:09:38,060
And you're on webcam too.

3598
03:09:38,060 --> 03:09:39,820
Are you calling us from your Xbox One?

3599
03:09:40,620 --> 03:09:43,420
Yeah, I'm calling from pre-Xbox One.

3600
03:09:43,420 --> 03:09:46,620
It's called having Skype next to your Xbox 360

3601
03:09:46,620 --> 03:09:48,700
and chatting that way because it's a lot more fun

3602
03:09:48,700 --> 03:09:50,940
and you can shit talk that way without having Microsoft

3603
03:09:50,940 --> 03:09:52,140
kind of breathing down your throat.

3604
03:09:52,140 --> 03:09:54,380
So you're calling us from an Xbox Vision camera?

3605
03:09:55,100 --> 03:09:55,740
Actually, no.

3606
03:09:55,740 --> 03:09:57,580
I'm calling from my awesome Logitech camera.

3607
03:09:57,580 --> 03:09:58,080
Awesome.

3608
03:09:58,940 --> 03:10:01,500
Well, I noticed you got your Luigi hat on

3609
03:10:01,500 --> 03:10:03,100
and you got your Luigi coffee cup.

3610
03:10:03,100 --> 03:10:04,300
You have a Luigi coffee cup?

3611
03:10:04,300 --> 03:10:05,260
That's awesome.

3612
03:10:05,260 --> 03:10:06,300
Got it from Nintendo World.

3613
03:10:06,300 --> 03:10:09,580
They also have a Happy Holidays Christmas mug as well.

3614
03:10:09,580 --> 03:10:12,140
You're in your Luigi shirt.

3615
03:10:12,380 --> 03:10:13,740
I see a Luigi shirt that says...

3616
03:10:13,740 --> 03:10:14,300
What does that say?

3617
03:10:14,300 --> 03:10:15,660
It's mirror imaged for me.

3618
03:10:15,660 --> 03:10:16,380
It says the L...

3619
03:10:17,020 --> 03:10:19,020
The L does not stand for loser.

3620
03:10:20,060 --> 03:10:23,740
So you are in full black Luigi mode tonight.

3621
03:10:23,740 --> 03:10:25,180
Yeah, something like that.

3622
03:10:25,180 --> 03:10:28,140
A friend of mine does a webcomic called Sucks to be Weegee

3623
03:10:28,140 --> 03:10:29,340
and it's pretty funny.

3624
03:10:29,340 --> 03:10:31,260
And somewhere around here I have a...

3625
03:10:31,260 --> 03:10:32,700
Oh, here it is.

3626
03:10:32,700 --> 03:10:35,820
I also picked this up from my soon to be tree.

3627
03:10:38,060 --> 03:10:41,100
A Luigi ornament that says Happy Holidays.

3628
03:10:41,660 --> 03:10:42,780
That's adorable.

3629
03:10:43,740 --> 03:10:45,580
Now, I got some stuff we gotta talk about.

3630
03:10:45,580 --> 03:10:47,420
So Rob, get the coffee on.

3631
03:10:47,420 --> 03:10:48,380
We got some talking to do.

3632
03:10:48,380 --> 03:10:49,260
All right.

3633
03:10:49,260 --> 03:10:50,540
I'll get out the cheesecake.

3634
03:10:51,340 --> 03:10:52,220
Oh, fabulous.

3635
03:10:52,220 --> 03:10:52,720
Fabulous.

3636
03:10:53,740 --> 03:10:55,660
Tell me about that one time in St. Olaf.

3637
03:11:00,220 --> 03:11:01,740
Rob, you are something else.

3638
03:11:01,740 --> 03:11:02,380
I know.

3639
03:11:02,380 --> 03:11:03,260
I get that a lot.

3640
03:11:03,260 --> 03:11:03,660
No, really.

3641
03:11:03,660 --> 03:11:04,160
What's up?

3642
03:11:05,020 --> 03:11:08,780
To back what Kaijido said, that's what I knew Danny Wells from

3643
03:11:08,780 --> 03:11:13,500
because when the show first came on, I spotted Luigi before I noticed Mario was

3644
03:11:13,500 --> 03:11:15,260
done by Captain Lou Albano, okay?

3645
03:11:17,020 --> 03:11:21,420
So that whole thing kind of comes full circle to me.

3646
03:11:21,420 --> 03:11:21,920
Yeah.

3647
03:11:22,220 --> 03:11:22,720
Oh.

3648
03:11:23,340 --> 03:11:26,540
Also, I like to say, fuck yes to Square One TV.

3649
03:11:26,540 --> 03:11:30,140
That show got me to run home to watch it, okay?

3650
03:11:30,140 --> 03:11:30,640
Me too.

3651
03:11:31,500 --> 03:11:36,940
Got out of school at 3.10, I was there watching Thundercat to 3.30, Square One TV at 4.

3652
03:11:37,900 --> 03:11:40,860
I think Square One was on for us at like three.

3653
03:11:40,860 --> 03:11:43,980
Like I had to get home fast if I wanted to see it because, you know, elementary school,

3654
03:11:43,980 --> 03:11:44,940
you get out a little earlier.

3655
03:11:44,940 --> 03:11:46,860
PBS affiliates don't have a set schedule.

3656
03:11:46,860 --> 03:11:48,540
It differs from every single market.

3657
03:11:48,540 --> 03:11:51,660
Yeah, I think for us it was on at three, but I think it was timed for like when elementary

3658
03:11:51,660 --> 03:11:53,100
kids get out of school, so it makes sense.

3659
03:11:53,740 --> 03:11:56,380
Yeah, and if I missed it on one PBS station, I could catch it.

3660
03:11:56,380 --> 03:11:59,100
On another PBS station, like an hour or a half hour later.

3661
03:11:59,100 --> 03:12:00,220
You have more than one?

3662
03:12:00,220 --> 03:12:01,740
He's New York City, dude.

3663
03:12:01,740 --> 03:12:06,780
Yeah, we have PBS 13, there's Channel 21, there's 25.

3664
03:12:07,500 --> 03:12:09,980
There's like 50 PBSes.

3665
03:12:09,980 --> 03:12:10,940
Never heard of this before.

3666
03:12:10,940 --> 03:12:13,180
There's a network that we get to Channel 50.

3667
03:12:13,180 --> 03:12:14,140
Well, we get a few of them.

3668
03:12:14,780 --> 03:12:16,940
We've got Channel 6, take it or leave it.

3669
03:12:19,100 --> 03:12:22,860
And the minute you have your antenna, you can pick up stations from Connecticut.

3670
03:12:22,860 --> 03:12:25,500
Oh, that's right, because there's a PBS 9 in Reading.

3671
03:12:25,500 --> 03:12:26,700
Anyway, cool story, bro.

3672
03:12:28,300 --> 03:12:31,340
Let's talk about TV channels in your neck of the woods.

3673
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:33,740
No, no, let's not, let's not.

3674
03:12:34,700 --> 03:12:39,980
And what I just realized, with Nintendo rehashing all of these video games,

3675
03:12:39,980 --> 03:12:45,660
Nintendo is becoming that old celebrity is trying to relive their prime with another greatest hits.

3676
03:12:46,220 --> 03:12:47,740
That's what it's like this time.

3677
03:12:47,740 --> 03:12:50,700
You know, it's like you first have Donkey Kong Country in,

3678
03:12:50,700 --> 03:12:53,900
Donkey Kong Country Returns, Donkey Kong Country comes back again.

3679
03:12:53,900 --> 03:12:57,420
I think the next one's going to be Donkey Kong Country comes out of retirement.

3680
03:12:57,420 --> 03:13:02,460
The only difference is maybe extra level or redone music or something like that.

3681
03:13:02,540 --> 03:13:04,300
Donkey Kong is getting up there in age.

3682
03:13:05,180 --> 03:13:08,220
Yeah, how about Donkey Kong gets out of retirement home?

3683
03:13:09,100 --> 03:13:12,780
Are you looking forward to the new Donkey Kong Country game or are you over it?

3684
03:13:13,500 --> 03:13:14,300
I'm over it.

3685
03:13:14,300 --> 03:13:17,260
Like I said, I'm only picking up a Wii U once, Bayonetta 2,

3686
03:13:17,260 --> 03:13:18,620
and Mario Kart 8 comes out.

3687
03:13:18,620 --> 03:13:20,460
Other than that, it can wait.

3688
03:13:20,460 --> 03:13:21,900
Mario Kart 8 is what, April?

3689
03:13:22,780 --> 03:13:23,420
Yeah.

3690
03:13:23,420 --> 03:13:26,460
I don't think they really have a date yet for it, but I think it was around April.

3691
03:13:26,460 --> 03:13:27,980
Yeah, April or Mayesh.

3692
03:13:27,980 --> 03:13:30,060
I am living for Mario Kart 8.

3693
03:13:30,060 --> 03:13:31,420
It better deliver.

3694
03:13:32,220 --> 03:13:35,260
Yeah, even if it gets delayed, I'm like, I can wait.

3695
03:13:35,820 --> 03:13:41,340
Yeah, if it's a great Mario Kart game, it'll be worth the wait.

3696
03:13:41,340 --> 03:13:41,580
Yes.

3697
03:13:43,180 --> 03:13:45,260
A couple of things.

3698
03:13:45,260 --> 03:13:49,900
I think last week, a week prior, I talked about podcasting and the Sound Blaster card and stuff.

3699
03:13:51,500 --> 03:13:55,020
Any desktop PC off the shelf can do the same thing.

3700
03:13:55,020 --> 03:13:57,420
You have to go into the settings and enable it.

3701
03:13:57,420 --> 03:13:58,220
You can do it.

3702
03:13:58,220 --> 03:14:00,140
Oh, for some reason,

3703
03:14:00,140 --> 03:14:01,900
my studio computer doesn't do it so well.

3704
03:14:01,900 --> 03:14:04,300
And I just want to point out, just for our listeners,

3705
03:14:04,300 --> 03:14:06,780
Rama's call quality is dropping significantly,

3706
03:14:06,780 --> 03:14:08,700
so that's why his voice kind of changed a little bit.

3707
03:14:08,700 --> 03:14:09,740
I don't know what's going on.

3708
03:14:09,740 --> 03:14:12,140
He might need to stop his porn torrents or...

3709
03:14:12,140 --> 03:14:12,620
No, I just...

3710
03:14:13,260 --> 03:14:18,380
Sometimes, with all the 50 PBSs transmitting signals in New York City,

3711
03:14:18,380 --> 03:14:20,860
sometimes the signal gets a little clogged.

3712
03:14:20,860 --> 03:14:23,100
I'm not sure if you're following porn by PBS.

3713
03:14:23,100 --> 03:14:23,580
Never mind.

3714
03:14:24,780 --> 03:14:25,580
Well, I think you're right.

3715
03:14:25,580 --> 03:14:28,860
It is my porn torrents.

3716
03:14:28,860 --> 03:14:32,300
Finally, finally, somebody fesses that fuck up on this show.

3717
03:14:32,300 --> 03:14:34,460
Yes, Robin, it was my porn torrents.

3718
03:14:34,460 --> 03:14:35,180
Thank you.

3719
03:14:35,180 --> 03:14:36,380
You're an honest man.

3720
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:39,340
I abuse my files connection.

3721
03:14:39,340 --> 03:14:42,860
I get 66 megs coming down, 33 megs going up.

3722
03:14:42,860 --> 03:14:46,380
All right, Rama, a quick last thought to get out here before we let you go.

3723
03:14:47,420 --> 03:14:47,740
Yes.

3724
03:14:48,460 --> 03:14:50,300
Okay, my last thought is this.

3725
03:14:51,340 --> 03:14:54,540
If you want to play classic Nintendo cartridges on your Wii U,

3726
03:14:54,540 --> 03:14:59,500
turn your Wii U on, push start A, and a spot will pop up for classic cartridges.

3727
03:15:00,460 --> 03:15:04,060
Okay, go post that to 4chan and see if somebody believes you.

3728
03:15:04,060 --> 03:15:09,420
All right, Rama, it's getting very crackly and stuff, so I really have to let you go.

3729
03:15:09,420 --> 03:15:12,140
But thanks so much for the call, and have a good one, okay?

3730
03:15:13,500 --> 03:15:14,060
All right, bye.

3731
03:15:14,700 --> 03:15:18,700
Rama, anime jam session on Tuesday nights, everybody, here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

3732
03:15:19,340 --> 03:15:21,020
We can probably squeeze in one more call.

3733
03:15:22,220 --> 03:15:23,980
There's a little ad on my Skype right now.

3734
03:15:23,980 --> 03:15:28,380
I just want to point out, talk to friends while watching live TV with Skype on Xbox One.

3735
03:15:28,380 --> 03:15:28,880
No.

3736
03:15:31,420 --> 03:15:34,060
There's no box for me to respond, so.

3737
03:15:34,060 --> 03:15:39,260
All right, 1877 Game O-L-R or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3738
03:15:39,260 --> 03:15:41,900
I do want to see if I can at least get to some of these Twitter topics,

3739
03:15:41,900 --> 03:15:43,740
because we had some good Twitter topics come in,

3740
03:15:43,740 --> 03:15:46,220
and we're falling a little behind here on the show.

3741
03:15:46,780 --> 03:15:48,220
Loki, did you have any last minute stories?

3742
03:15:48,780 --> 03:15:49,740
Uh, no.

3743
03:15:49,740 --> 03:15:50,460
No, okay.

3744
03:15:51,100 --> 03:15:53,180
Um, let's see.

3745
03:15:54,060 --> 03:16:00,220
Surtur wanted to ask, he hopes that Bobby and us talk about Grand Tourism.

3746
03:16:00,220 --> 03:16:02,300
Grand Tourismo 6 tonight.

3747
03:16:02,300 --> 03:16:06,940
You know what, Dan, we got it, and Dan's been playing the crap out of it.

3748
03:16:06,940 --> 03:16:09,180
He really liked it, and then he actually watched football,

3749
03:16:09,180 --> 03:16:10,940
which made me wonder who replaced my husband.

3750
03:16:13,020 --> 03:16:14,460
Dan doesn't usually watch football?

3751
03:16:14,460 --> 03:16:16,380
He does sometimes, but usually with other people.

3752
03:16:16,380 --> 03:16:17,820
He was in there watching it by himself.

3753
03:16:17,820 --> 03:16:19,660
I'm like, where's my husband?

3754
03:16:20,460 --> 03:16:20,940
Who are you?

3755
03:16:21,980 --> 03:16:23,820
Uh, Spazinator tweets us and asks,

3756
03:16:23,820 --> 03:16:26,780
Loki, quadruple cheese and quadruple bacon pizza,

3757
03:16:26,780 --> 03:16:28,700
or quadruple bacon double cheeseburger?

3758
03:16:28,700 --> 03:16:29,420
I can answer that.

3759
03:16:29,420 --> 03:16:29,920
Pizza.

3760
03:16:30,780 --> 03:16:33,660
No, because that much cheese on the pizza is actually not very good,

3761
03:16:33,660 --> 03:16:36,540
and even extra cheese on the pizza is not very good.

3762
03:16:36,540 --> 03:16:38,860
And when you do quadruple cheese, trust me, I've seen it before.

3763
03:16:38,860 --> 03:16:41,980
It's just, it's not as good as you'd think, because it's too much.

3764
03:16:41,980 --> 03:16:43,740
That's a lot of grease you're adding on there,

3765
03:16:43,740 --> 03:16:46,540
and it just, it throws off the magic ratio.

3766
03:16:46,540 --> 03:16:48,620
Adding tons of bacon though, go right ahead.

3767
03:16:48,620 --> 03:16:50,460
You're taking that question way too seriously.

3768
03:16:50,460 --> 03:16:50,940
I know.

3769
03:16:50,940 --> 03:16:51,500
All right.

3770
03:16:51,500 --> 03:16:54,060
How do you think he didn't take it far enough, to be honest?

3771
03:16:54,060 --> 03:16:57,180
1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3772
03:16:57,180 --> 03:16:58,300
I wonder if that was on our end,

3773
03:16:58,300 --> 03:17:00,460
because we were getting more calls a minute ago,

3774
03:17:00,460 --> 03:17:03,020
and now nothing is lighting up, sad face.

3775
03:17:03,020 --> 03:17:04,620
Okay, let's see.

3776
03:17:06,140 --> 03:17:07,580
ActDeft tweeted us,

3777
03:17:08,540 --> 03:17:12,460
there's more info surrounding the legend of Sonic 3's soundtrack.

3778
03:17:12,460 --> 03:17:14,860
I wonder if this ties into the whole Michael Jackson thing,

3779
03:17:14,860 --> 03:17:17,580
because wasn't there a, wasn't there like a,

3780
03:17:18,220 --> 03:17:19,820
somebody ran a whole thing on that.

3781
03:17:19,820 --> 03:17:20,700
He didn't like,

3782
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:22,780
Jackson didn't like the limitations of the sound chip,

3783
03:17:22,780 --> 03:17:23,740
didn't like the way the,

3784
03:17:24,460 --> 03:17:26,220
he didn't like the results of the soundtrack,

3785
03:17:26,220 --> 03:17:28,620
so they still kept some of the inspiration,

3786
03:17:28,620 --> 03:17:32,140
but ultimately he wasn't credited and specifically involved.

3787
03:17:32,140 --> 03:17:32,780
Okay, apparently though,

3788
03:17:32,780 --> 03:17:34,780
this actually doesn't have to do with the game trailers thing.

3789
03:17:34,780 --> 03:17:37,100
Apparently, and this is the story that ActDeft leaked us,

3790
03:17:37,100 --> 03:17:40,060
just to kind of try to cover this quickly,

3791
03:17:42,060 --> 03:17:45,900
Fever, it's Fervor, Fervor Records on YouTube,

3792
03:17:45,900 --> 03:17:50,700
posted some unreleased music tracks from the band the Jetsons,

3793
03:17:50,700 --> 03:17:53,100
not the Jetsons, but the Jetsons.

3794
03:17:53,100 --> 03:17:53,580
Clever.

3795
03:17:53,580 --> 03:17:59,900
And one track called Hard Times was somewhat like the theme of Ice Cap Zone.

3796
03:17:59,900 --> 03:18:01,740
Well, why does that fucking matter?

3797
03:18:01,740 --> 03:18:04,460
Because the keyboardist of the group, who is Brad Buxer,

3798
03:18:05,340 --> 03:18:08,060
worked on the title along with Michael Jackson,

3799
03:18:08,060 --> 03:18:09,660
which he said in an interview.

3800
03:18:09,660 --> 03:18:12,540
He's not sure what material the developers used in the game,

3801
03:18:12,540 --> 03:18:15,740
but I guess it was remnants of that unreleased song,

3802
03:18:16,620 --> 03:18:18,700
so you know what?

3803
03:18:18,700 --> 03:18:20,380
Michael Jackson had something to do with it.

3804
03:18:20,380 --> 03:18:22,780
And because Michael Jackson is such a perfectionist,

3805
03:18:23,420 --> 03:18:26,060
I would fully believe that he just didn't like the way it was turning out.

3806
03:18:26,060 --> 03:18:27,580
So he walked away from it easily.

3807
03:18:27,580 --> 03:18:28,140
Easily.

3808
03:18:28,140 --> 03:18:31,180
I think that's the simple, simple story we have there.

3809
03:18:32,860 --> 03:18:35,100
Let me get to the calls real quick here.

3810
03:18:35,100 --> 03:18:36,140
We got one more call coming in.

3811
03:18:36,140 --> 03:18:37,100
This will probably be up for tonight.

3812
03:18:37,100 --> 03:18:38,060
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3813
03:18:38,060 --> 03:18:38,560
Who's this?

3814
03:18:39,980 --> 03:18:41,580
Hey, Zaku, we haven't heard from you in a while.

3815
03:18:41,580 --> 03:18:42,080
What's up, buddy?

3816
03:18:42,940 --> 03:18:43,980
Oh, not that much.

3817
03:18:43,980 --> 03:18:48,380
Just trying to chill on my night off.

3818
03:18:48,380 --> 03:18:51,100
Well, somebody turned out the lights,

3819
03:18:51,100 --> 03:18:53,260
but we're getting a lot of video calls tonight.

3820
03:18:53,260 --> 03:18:53,980
I like this.

3821
03:18:53,980 --> 03:18:55,180
So what's up, buddy?

3822
03:18:56,220 --> 03:18:58,140
No, I'm just trying to clean up Steam right now.

3823
03:18:58,140 --> 03:19:01,100
Managed to get like a second hard drive.

3824
03:19:01,820 --> 03:19:03,660
Well, actually two of them set up in raid,

3825
03:19:03,660 --> 03:19:08,620
but the idea is I'm gonna start moving my Steam games towards that one

3826
03:19:09,420 --> 03:19:11,660
and then actually downloading whatever else I don't have,

3827
03:19:11,660 --> 03:19:13,500
whatever else is in my backlog right now.

3828
03:19:14,620 --> 03:19:17,580
You look like you woke up at six in the morning to call this program.

3829
03:19:19,180 --> 03:19:21,020
I'm just like getting ready to go to bed.

3830
03:19:21,580 --> 03:19:22,140
It's all good.

3831
03:19:22,140 --> 03:19:22,620
It's all good.

3832
03:19:22,620 --> 03:19:24,860
Just don't mind the sore throat and congestion.

3833
03:19:24,860 --> 03:19:26,700
So what are you playing on Steam then?

3834
03:19:26,700 --> 03:19:28,140
What's your big Steam games of choice

3835
03:19:28,140 --> 03:19:30,220
that you got to move everything around to make space and stuff?

3836
03:19:31,100 --> 03:19:34,380
Well, I'm just trying to get stuff like the orange box,

3837
03:19:34,380 --> 03:19:36,620
all the other, you know, the other Half-Life games.

3838
03:19:36,620 --> 03:19:41,660
I just like, I guess I lost track and never actually got around to downloading it.

3839
03:19:42,380 --> 03:19:45,020
And then, you know, stuff like the two, you know,

3840
03:19:45,020 --> 03:19:49,500
the first two Mass Effect that I have and Sleeping Dogs.

3841
03:19:51,100 --> 03:19:54,700
I don't know if I want to do GTA 4 because I'm still on five, obviously.

3842
03:19:55,340 --> 03:19:59,100
And I still have Arkham Asylum and Arkham City that I still have to like fire up.

3843
03:20:01,260 --> 03:20:04,780
Everybody's got a backlog the size of 50 PBS stations

3844
03:20:05,420 --> 03:20:07,900
that they have to work their way through this holiday season.

3845
03:20:07,900 --> 03:20:10,860
Thank gosh, there's no more games coming out right now.

3846
03:20:10,860 --> 03:20:13,500
But what, what, what can, what can the listeners of our show

3847
03:20:13,500 --> 03:20:15,260
or what can we help you with tonight, Zaku?

3848
03:20:16,460 --> 03:20:20,700
Um, I, I guess, have you noticed, like, um,

3849
03:20:20,700 --> 03:20:25,820
I don't know if you covered this already, but remember that fighting game Skullgirls?

3850
03:20:26,380 --> 03:20:26,860
Yes.

3851
03:20:26,860 --> 03:20:28,140
Yeah, I get to play that tonight.

3852
03:20:29,180 --> 03:20:31,820
Um, apparently in two weeks,

3853
03:20:31,820 --> 03:20:35,900
their publisher Konami is pulling their games from the PSN and Xbox Live.

3854
03:20:35,900 --> 03:20:36,780
I caught you.

3855
03:20:36,780 --> 03:20:40,700
You did wake up just to call this show because we did talk about that about an hour ago.

3856
03:20:40,860 --> 03:20:44,140
So yes, we touched on some of the basics of that, but what, what are your thoughts with that?

3857
03:20:45,580 --> 03:20:45,980
I don't know.

3858
03:20:45,980 --> 03:20:48,700
I mean, this is this, this typical behavior of them.

3859
03:20:49,580 --> 03:20:53,900
I mean, if it's not, if it's them, like, you know, screwing over

3860
03:20:55,020 --> 03:20:59,020
itg or basically not giving shit about the money series,

3861
03:20:59,580 --> 03:21:01,900
it's them screwing over independent developers.

3862
03:21:01,900 --> 03:21:06,140
Well, hold on though, because I mean, and granted, I'm not going to be,

3863
03:21:06,140 --> 03:21:09,820
I'm not going to claim to be up and up on Skullgirls and everything that's going on,

3864
03:21:09,820 --> 03:21:12,780
but my understanding from what I'm reading is that they had an agreement.

3865
03:21:12,780 --> 03:21:14,860
The agreement is ending as of such and such date.

3866
03:21:14,860 --> 03:21:16,700
So Konami says, well, if we're not going to be making

3867
03:21:16,700 --> 03:21:19,100
money from this anymore than Yank, it's getting pulled.

3868
03:21:19,660 --> 03:21:21,820
But they didn't even, they didn't even, uh,

3869
03:21:22,780 --> 03:21:26,620
it didn't even inform their, their actual, uh, their developers.

3870
03:21:27,500 --> 03:21:30,780
They did not like, they did it behind their back.

3871
03:21:30,780 --> 03:21:35,340
Obviously they probably knew, they probably knew about the, the end of the agreement,

3872
03:21:35,340 --> 03:21:39,340
but they didn't even give them a heads up so they can plan a transition.

3873
03:21:40,380 --> 03:21:41,500
That's bad.

3874
03:21:41,500 --> 03:21:43,500
That's like bad business practice.

3875
03:21:43,500 --> 03:21:49,020
Like it's very unprofessional of them, especially if you're in a contract with a particular,

3876
03:21:49,020 --> 03:21:53,580
with another company that you're working with and you don't have the wherewithal to, you know,

3877
03:21:54,460 --> 03:21:58,220
provide for a smooth transition for all the other customers, all the other customers using it.

3878
03:21:58,780 --> 03:22:03,500
Let me, let me ask you this because, you know, what, what would be the best way to kind of

3879
03:22:03,500 --> 03:22:07,340
give that message to Konami that you're not happy with what they did?

3880
03:22:07,340 --> 03:22:10,940
Because obviously the answer is not boycotting Skullgirls because, you know,

3881
03:22:10,940 --> 03:22:13,180
you want to support that game, so that's not the answer.

3882
03:22:13,180 --> 03:22:17,420
And I don't think boycotting all Konami products is really a realistic answer.

3883
03:22:19,420 --> 03:22:21,420
Yeah, there's not, there's not enough stuff coming out.

3884
03:22:21,420 --> 03:22:25,180
So if, if gamers are really pissed off about this, Zaku, like you are,

3885
03:22:25,180 --> 03:22:28,220
what do you think is the best way we can express that to Konami and make them listen?

3886
03:22:28,220 --> 03:22:30,140
Stop buying their iOS and Android games.

3887
03:22:30,140 --> 03:22:31,500
Cause that's where all their business is now.

3888
03:22:33,100 --> 03:22:36,620
They basically, I mean, Babani's gone mobile at this point.

3889
03:22:36,620 --> 03:22:41,500
I don't, other than like niche pockets in arcades and certain parts of the country,

3890
03:22:41,500 --> 03:22:47,340
if not the world, everything else is just them microtransactioning all their, their,

3891
03:22:47,340 --> 03:22:50,060
their IPs, their music, rhythm based IPs.

3892
03:22:51,500 --> 03:22:52,460
That's pretty much it.

3893
03:22:52,460 --> 03:22:55,260
Well, yeah, that's been the state of Mamani for a few years now,

3894
03:22:55,260 --> 03:22:57,420
which is sad and depressing, but other people-

3895
03:22:57,420 --> 03:23:03,580
The principle of a work, you know, an independent, you know, an indie dev trying to, you know,

3896
03:23:03,580 --> 03:23:09,020
find a publisher, give them the light of day, but then at the, you know, the other hand,

3897
03:23:09,020 --> 03:23:12,540
they're actually, you know, they're actually doing not being, you know,

3898
03:23:12,540 --> 03:23:17,500
not giving them the professionalism that they gave them during the whole process.

3899
03:23:18,460 --> 03:23:22,940
As I said, it's, it's what, it's really what happens when you try to work with another,

3900
03:23:23,740 --> 03:23:27,420
with other clients and those clients in particular,

3901
03:23:27,420 --> 03:23:30,860
don't want to give you everything necessary to achieve business goals.

3902
03:23:30,860 --> 03:23:35,580
Well, I'd be curious to see if Konami does end up having to respond to this at all,

3903
03:23:35,580 --> 03:23:38,380
but I don't know, I just kind of have this weird feeling that-

3904
03:23:38,380 --> 03:23:39,180
They probably-

3905
03:23:39,180 --> 03:23:44,620
They probably won't and gamers will support Skullgirls on PC later on and then that's,

3906
03:23:44,620 --> 03:23:45,340
that's that.

3907
03:23:45,340 --> 03:23:45,900
But Zaku-

3908
03:23:45,900 --> 03:23:50,060
I guess what they're trying to do right now is they're trying to find another publisher or

3909
03:23:50,060 --> 03:23:53,980
trying to, well, right now in the short term, they're trying to get another build in,

3910
03:23:53,980 --> 03:23:58,860
they're trying to get an update in just to keep the game alive, per se.

3911
03:23:59,580 --> 03:24:04,140
But in, in terms of, yeah, they're done with Konami at this point, but they just need to,

3912
03:24:05,260 --> 03:24:09,580
they just need to, you know, be more, they need to do a little bit more due diligence

3913
03:24:09,580 --> 03:24:12,140
on their actual, on their future publisher.

3914
03:24:12,780 --> 03:24:15,660
All right, Zaku, I've got to, I've got to wrap this up.

3915
03:24:15,660 --> 03:24:18,940
We've got to go because we're running way late, but you know what?

3916
03:24:18,940 --> 03:24:24,540
I, I'd be, I'd be curious to see what the response is on a greater scale to this because

3917
03:24:24,540 --> 03:24:27,020
obviously there's a lot of people that are pretty unhappy about this.

3918
03:24:27,020 --> 03:24:28,060
But, uh, I don't know.

3919
03:24:28,060 --> 03:24:30,540
I just, I just don't know if it's going to be enough to make waves, but we'll see.

3920
03:24:30,540 --> 03:24:31,100
We'll see.

3921
03:24:31,100 --> 03:24:31,340
All right.

3922
03:24:31,340 --> 03:24:31,740
All right.

3923
03:24:31,740 --> 03:24:32,620
Zaku, take care, buddy.

3924
03:24:32,620 --> 03:24:33,180
Thanks for the call.

3925
03:24:33,180 --> 03:24:33,740
Have a good one.

3926
03:24:33,740 --> 03:24:34,060
All right.

3927
03:24:34,060 --> 03:24:34,860
Sleep well.

3928
03:24:34,860 --> 03:24:35,260
Bye.

3929
03:24:35,260 --> 03:24:36,140
Vitamin C.

3930
03:24:36,140 --> 03:24:37,500
You look like you have a cold.

3931
03:24:37,500 --> 03:24:37,820
All right.

3932
03:24:37,820 --> 03:24:39,580
One, uh, no, no more phone numbers.

3933
03:24:39,580 --> 03:24:39,980
Sorry, guys.

3934
03:24:39,980 --> 03:24:43,100
Sorry to those that didn't get through, but, uh, we're running along tonight, so we've

3935
03:24:43,100 --> 03:24:46,860
got to wrap it on up, but please, uh, you can always email us your thoughts.

3936
03:24:46,860 --> 03:24:50,220
Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com.

3937
03:24:50,220 --> 03:24:53,980
I had one other Twitter topic I wanted to hit on and, and we didn't have last minute

3938
03:24:53,980 --> 03:24:54,620
stories, right?

3939
03:24:55,420 --> 03:24:57,020
S2 100 Matt tweeted us.

3940
03:24:57,020 --> 03:25:03,260
This is sports ball related, but someone took the Alabama versus Auburn unbelievable final

3941
03:25:03,260 --> 03:25:06,300
final play and remade it in Tecmo bowl.

3942
03:25:07,260 --> 03:25:08,140
So, okay.

3943
03:25:08,140 --> 03:25:09,180
I have to watch that.

3944
03:25:09,180 --> 03:25:15,260
And then somebody put this in a way that would make Jamie and I care is really the news I'm

3945
03:25:15,260 --> 03:25:15,660
hearing.

3946
03:25:15,660 --> 03:25:17,180
And then I have to show it to my mother.

3947
03:25:18,060 --> 03:25:21,420
My mom was reporting for Alabama bowl is great.

3948
03:25:21,420 --> 03:25:22,060
All right.

3949
03:25:22,060 --> 03:25:23,420
Uh, we got to wrap it up.

3950
03:25:23,420 --> 03:25:28,220
We are like, so done because, uh, this is almost a four hour show tonight and it's,

3951
03:25:28,220 --> 03:25:31,820
it's not even a marathon show, but thank you guys for staying with us tonight.

3952
03:25:31,820 --> 03:25:33,980
The whole way through really appreciate it.

3953
03:25:33,980 --> 03:25:37,580
You know, we always say here at orange launch radio, if you like the show, all we ask, tell

3954
03:25:37,580 --> 03:25:42,780
a friend or five or 15 or 50 about the show, help us spread the word about orange launch

3955
03:25:42,780 --> 03:25:43,020
radio.

3956
03:25:43,020 --> 03:25:44,060
We really appreciate it.

3957
03:25:44,060 --> 03:25:47,980
Uh, leave us a nice word or a nice review wherever you found this show.

3958
03:25:47,980 --> 03:25:49,820
Maybe that was iTunes podcast.

3959
03:25:49,980 --> 03:25:53,420
Stitcher radio, uh, has been doing great for us lately.

3960
03:25:53,420 --> 03:25:55,420
And we really want to thank the folks at Stitcher.

3961
03:25:55,420 --> 03:25:59,020
I don't know if you guys know this, but we broke the top 15 game shows this past week.

3962
03:25:59,020 --> 03:26:03,820
That, that blows my, blows my mind and that's really because of you guys out there listening

3963
03:26:03,820 --> 03:26:04,540
and supporting the show.

3964
03:26:04,540 --> 03:26:05,580
So I really appreciate it.

3965
03:26:05,580 --> 03:26:07,740
So, uh, leave a nice review and so forth.

3966
03:26:07,740 --> 03:26:09,660
Uh, every little bit helps.

3967
03:26:09,660 --> 03:26:13,340
And I think that's a big part of why we are doing as well as we are over there.

3968
03:26:13,340 --> 03:26:18,780
Um, before we close up shop tonight and play the credits, uh, I gotta get people's final

3969
03:26:18,780 --> 03:26:19,500
thoughts.

3970
03:26:19,500 --> 03:26:21,340
Jason, thank you once again for being here.

3971
03:26:21,340 --> 03:26:22,540
I hope you had a good time.

3972
03:26:22,540 --> 03:26:25,580
Always, always, always, always, always what people may not realize.

3973
03:26:25,580 --> 03:26:31,180
You have to drive an, an hour and 45 minutes to get here one way on a Sunday and you do

3974
03:26:31,180 --> 03:26:35,660
it for this show and then you go back and you, yeah, and you edit the video.

3975
03:26:35,660 --> 03:26:39,020
So you, you are, we, we really appreciate your dedication and thank you.

3976
03:26:39,020 --> 03:26:39,580
Thank you.

3977
03:26:39,580 --> 03:26:43,580
The show would not be possible without you literally because you've also helped us with

3978
03:26:43,580 --> 03:26:44,460
many a web thing.

3979
03:26:44,460 --> 03:26:45,020
So thank you.

3980
03:26:45,020 --> 03:26:45,420
Thank you.

3981
03:26:45,420 --> 03:26:46,540
I always look forward to it.

3982
03:26:46,540 --> 03:26:48,860
Uh, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3983
03:26:51,260 --> 03:26:55,260
I am doing a very good job of having ideas, not writing them down and forgetting them.

3984
03:26:55,260 --> 03:26:56,300
So here's to here.

3985
03:26:56,300 --> 03:26:57,180
You forgetfulness.

3986
03:26:57,180 --> 03:26:59,020
You have a laptop in front of you.

3987
03:26:59,020 --> 03:26:59,820
I know.

3988
03:26:59,820 --> 03:27:03,900
Launch that notes application and have it open at all times, sir.

3989
03:27:03,900 --> 03:27:05,740
Yes, I am definitely doing that from here on out.

3990
03:27:05,740 --> 03:27:06,780
That's an order.

3991
03:27:06,780 --> 03:27:07,100
All right.

3992
03:27:07,100 --> 03:27:08,460
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

3993
03:27:09,260 --> 03:27:14,940
Um, I also forgot that I played surgeon simulator 2013 today.

3994
03:27:14,940 --> 03:27:17,020
Or I should say, I let my son watch me do that.

3995
03:27:17,020 --> 03:27:21,900
It was more like knocking stuff off desks, a simulator, because that's what I was doing

3996
03:27:22,460 --> 03:27:25,500
because he was too afraid of the actual surgeries.

3997
03:27:25,500 --> 03:27:26,780
It's like, I don't like this game.

3998
03:27:27,740 --> 03:27:33,580
Um, so yeah, so that's all I have.

3999
03:27:34,460 --> 03:27:34,940
All right.

4000
03:27:34,940 --> 03:27:36,620
And dark soccer, your final thought tonight?

4001
03:27:37,260 --> 03:27:37,760
Meh.

4002
03:27:38,700 --> 03:27:39,420
You know why?

4003
03:27:39,420 --> 03:27:40,060
Why?

4004
03:27:40,060 --> 03:27:42,300
Because I went pink berry and it's not cheat day.

4005
03:27:42,300 --> 03:27:42,800
Okay.

4006
03:27:44,620 --> 03:27:45,020
Okay.

4007
03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:47,500
That's I'm going to leave it at that, uh, beak.

4008
03:27:48,220 --> 03:27:53,500
Yeah, because I may or may not have something in the freezer right now, but I'll save it.

4009
03:27:53,500 --> 03:27:54,220
I'll save it.

4010
03:27:54,220 --> 03:27:55,020
I'll save it.

4011
03:27:55,020 --> 03:27:55,740
All right.

4012
03:27:55,740 --> 03:28:02,460
Uh, my final thought for the night is, um, candy canes are the best thing about Christmas.

4013
03:28:03,260 --> 03:28:07,420
Candy canes are the best thing about Christmas and that new candy cane flavor at the pink

4014
03:28:07,420 --> 03:28:07,920
berry.

4015
03:28:08,940 --> 03:28:13,260
Actually, they do have peppermint, but dark soccer brought me a pumpkin candy cane before

4016
03:28:13,260 --> 03:28:13,580
the show.

4017
03:28:13,580 --> 03:28:14,700
It's like a giant one.

4018
03:28:14,700 --> 03:28:16,540
I ate it all during the show.

4019
03:28:17,580 --> 03:28:18,780
Cause I love food.

4020
03:28:18,780 --> 03:28:20,140
You were done before the show.

4021
03:28:20,140 --> 03:28:21,420
Actually, that was during Bobby.

4022
03:28:21,420 --> 03:28:22,300
I love food.

4023
03:28:22,300 --> 03:28:24,300
Did it really taste like pumpkin pie?

4024
03:28:24,300 --> 03:28:25,020
It was good.

4025
03:28:25,020 --> 03:28:25,180
Yeah.

4026
03:28:25,180 --> 03:28:26,780
It tastes like, I offered to let you lick it.

4027
03:28:27,340 --> 03:28:28,380
I don't want your cooties.

4028
03:28:28,380 --> 03:28:30,300
You already gave me gay seven years ago.

4029
03:28:31,100 --> 03:28:31,980
Remember that?

4030
03:28:31,980 --> 03:28:32,940
Sorry about that.

4031
03:28:32,940 --> 03:28:34,860
No, no, there's a story.

4032
03:28:34,860 --> 03:28:35,180
All right.

4033
03:28:35,180 --> 03:28:35,580
Quickly.

4034
03:28:35,580 --> 03:28:36,860
Cause we got plenty of credits.

4035
03:28:36,860 --> 03:28:41,420
We were at Goff land and they had these big Pepsi bong bone drink things.

4036
03:28:41,420 --> 03:28:44,940
And so I let Rob have a sip of it and I said, I don't have cooties or anything.

4037
03:28:44,940 --> 03:28:45,500
He's like, okay.

4038
03:28:45,500 --> 03:28:46,460
And took a drink, passed it back.

4039
03:28:46,460 --> 03:28:47,660
He goes, I have gay.

4040
03:28:47,660 --> 03:28:50,940
I was like, and Irene was there and I was like, Oh my God, Irene, let's date.

4041
03:28:54,060 --> 03:28:58,940
And for the rest of the day, you did kind of, she just shrugged.

4042
03:28:58,940 --> 03:28:59,440
Maybe.

4043
03:28:59,980 --> 03:29:00,380
All right.

4044
03:29:00,380 --> 03:29:01,980
Uh, I know Irene's pretty cute.

4045
03:29:01,980 --> 03:29:07,100
Uh, thank you guys again for downloading the show and checking it out.

4046
03:29:07,100 --> 03:29:08,140
We really appreciate it.

4047
03:29:08,140 --> 03:29:10,300
We'll be back to do this all again next week.

4048
03:29:10,300 --> 03:29:12,300
Same bat time, same bat channel.

4049
03:29:12,300 --> 03:29:14,700
Have a great week in your gaming, whatever it is you're playing.

4050
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:15,660
Just have fun.

4051
03:29:15,660 --> 03:29:17,660
It is an exciting time to be a gamer.

4052
03:29:17,660 --> 03:29:18,140
Good night.

4053
03:29:18,860 --> 03:29:21,580
