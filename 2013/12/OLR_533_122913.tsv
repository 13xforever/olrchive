10823	15007	I am Loki Happy New Year!
15047	38246	Well, Happy New Year to those of you listening to this in 2014 Tonight we're still a few days away and that means we still have to close out the year Take a look back with us as we reminisce about 2013 and take your comments and calls on this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the very last episode of Orange Lounge Radio
39431	39571	Trollol
64000	64901	of our show.
65281	70323	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me, as you already heard, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
70443	71704	I'm gonna finish this dang puzzle.
72164	73244	What are you playing right now?
73344	80668	You're playing... Me Plaza, so I can get puzzle pieces since a certain somebody who also has this puzzle completed came in.
80888	81809	Those puzzles.
81849	82029	Yes.
83310	85912	That is kind of like my little crack addiction on the 3DS.
86112	91656	Like when I'm not playing a 3DS game or whatever, I like to do the little street passing, collecting the puzzles.
92016	94718	You know what's really great for that now is Starbucks.
94898	95218	Oh, yeah.
95478	97620	I go to at least three different Starbucks a week now.
97840	99481	And you get like six people at a time now.
99541	100802	Also, I'm going to steal Alan.
101022	101383	Thank you.
102173	109101	Alan, by the way, just since it's not video, Alan brought some wine in for our celebratory last episode of the year.
109222	109822	Thank you, Alan.
110363	111785	We'll see Alan in Part B a little later.
112358	113198	Jam Jar is not bad.
113619	114739	This is, okay.
114979	117741	It's not as sweet as Frivolo.
118101	118761	Sorry, listeners.
118881	120362	I know this is not great radio, but I have wine.
120382	121282	We're having wine tasting.
121302	121863	I'm having wine.
122143	122583	I am too.
122603	124924	I'm going to sip you here on the wine.
125004	126025	I have wine and coffee.
127485	128346	I don't know about that combination.
128566	132548	All right, but anyway, while we sip away here on some wine, why don't we say hello via Skype?
132588	134048	Say hello to Loki, everybody.
134749	135069	Hi.
135329	136169	Hey, Loki, how you doing?
138711	139531	I was doing good.
139858	141199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
169847	170147	Yes.
171428	171808	Yes.
172048	172168	Yes.
199738	200278	That makes sense.
201158	201678	I don't blame you.
202039	205139	Well, have you played any of the 30 games that you've actually bought?
205759	206240	Yes, I have.
206520	208860	And what was your favorite out of what you played so far?
209720	211041	The Stanley Parable was pretty good.
211761	212461	Yes, it is.
212781	216642	Okay, did you get the two special endings?
218023	219783	Where you go visit the other places?
221484	249615	um yeah I got that ending I've got all the endings I think don't spoil y'all I'm about I think four away from beating from all of them but you also get really random ones too so yeah um well Loki the sale is through January 3rd are you gonna try to restrain yourself now or is it still open season you're gonna buy a bunch of stuff well here's the thing I'm right now things to actually buy I really want that's the thing
250367	260851	Oh yeah, just as said in our chat room just now, because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
261211	264412	And Fifth Dream in chat says, new sale is up, Loki, get crackin'.
264432	268014	That's right, it's 6 o'clock, so they just flipped over.
268654	271015	And for anyone who's interested, I'm opening Normandy.
271738	273542	And that's your Animal Crossing town, right?
274464	275947	Has Duke Nukem gone up yet?
276207	279834	I've seen it up for a vote, but I haven't seen it actually on sale yet.
279914	280976	And I really want it on sale.
283280	286421	I thought it was part of one of the flash sales, but I don't remember.
286441	287941	It might have been one of the ones I missed.
287981	291001	If so, I'm going to be really irked because that's one of the games I wanted to get.
291362	295302	But Loki, thank you again for the $20 gift card you got me for the holidays.
296002	300103	I used that to buy a bunch of trading cards and level myself up to $20.
300963	306584	But then I crafted that badge for the snow season or whatever, the snow winter sale badge.
306984	309285	And I got an item in there that I sold for like $0.75.
309605	311665	So that paid for like five of the cards right there.
312125	337707	so yeah the items i got were crap so i ended up just selling all of them because it was like oh hey a football manager background yeah totally awesome hey some addicting crap though all that stuff but uh yeah i got some good i've got some good stuff on steam so i'll talk a little more about that later oh i'm looking uh it looks like the flash sale right now stanley parable funny enough you guys talk about that and bioshock infinite which i'm going to talk about a little later because i finally played it this week
338286	339007	I need to play that.
339447	346932	Alright, but before we get to that talk, we also have to introduce here with us in studio, say hello to the voice of the show, joining us over the season.
347152	351615	I guess it's been about three months now, or will be by the time you're... Sure feels like it.
351675	353036	But we love having you here.
353356	358879	Even though we've always kind of been three people, it's fun to mix things up a little while, and you do great, and you have a great voice.
359240	361521	So we always love having here in the studio Jason, everybody.
361561	362001	That's me.
362161	362582	How you doing?
363122	366064	I'm still in a bit of a rush, and I'm trying to get my heart rate back down.
366244	370609	Jason literally walked through the door as we were playing the opening song tonight.
371370	372952	If not, maybe a little bit before.
373012	374534	But what's your excuse, young man?
374594	376016	You were in the Bay Area.
376056	377458	What's your excuse, young man?
377678	379760	You have a curfew of 6 p.m.
379820	380421	and you got here at 6.02.
380702	385067	Don't ever be a co-host on Horde House because you will get emails like that.
385587	401453	I went to a Raiders game versus Broncos in my defense I went to a Raiders game with a co-worker of mine and despite leaving early traffic and everything else I just I timed it perfectly well actually all things considered
402353	406817	So you did make it here, but I'm sorry you had to suffer through watching the Raiders play.
407798	408399	That's unfortunate.
408819	414864	It's actually my first ever game that I've been to in a stadium, football-wise.
416206	420149	I went to the Mile High Stadium as a kid, but for a concert, a teenager.
421150	426415	But I don't think I've ever seen a football game, high school, college, anything in a venue before.
426895	428636	So it was nice to see.
428876	433019	It was a good reminder to find out how hectic things are, especially in the Bay Area.
433459	433920	It was fun.
433940	434800	It was really interesting.
434840	436521	It was really good being able to get out there and do that again.
436541	437902	You didn't get shot or shot at?
439203	440464	One of them, definitely not.
440504	446408	The second one, well, there's a lot of bangs in the arena, but I don't think it was somebody firing a gun.
447741	449824	Uh, go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
449864	452348	BlackWolf says, Jason's excuse is identical to mine.
452388	452688	That's right.
452708	453129	Football.
453429	457394	Yeah, he plays in the football drum line in Atlanta, so, uh, exciting stuff.
457454	459377	He says he did this show tonight in his uniform.
459517	460618	That's how last minute it was.
460779	462481	I was like, why don't you have a webcam, Bobby?
462501	463102	That'd be hilarious.
463502	467044	You know, you and I have seen our share of high school football games.
467144	468245	Oh God, yes, me and the band.
468325	475309	I went to an Alabama-Auburn game, which anyone from Alabama, any part of the South will know how big the college football thing is.
475529	476090	I fell asleep.
477290	478011	I was so bored.
480248	487211	Let's see, going to the chat room as well, live.vognetwork.com Mako asking some questions about Duke Nukem saying, wait, Duke Nukem forever?
487551	488172	Are you nuts?
488772	492653	I just want to clarify, Duke Nukem 3D.
492894	497275	If I said forever, then I obviously overly misspoke and what a faux pas.
497515	499176	Duke Nukem 3D is what I'm waiting for.
499216	503518	That was also my very first convention land game.
503698	504058	Nice.
504198	507940	Was Duke Nukem 3D when you could do the voice macros and everything.
507980	508540	That was awesome.
508680	512822	I'm sure I've told this story on the show before, but we used to play that in the college dorms, like, over the dial-up.
512982	515823	Because, you know, all those little rooms, I mean, dorm rooms are tiny, right?
515844	517144	But we'd all have our own phone number.
517504	525248	So I would play in my room, and then my best friend who lived next door to me would play Duke Nukem in his room, and we would call each other over the phone and do that.
525628	532792	And the bros in the dorm loved it, because they would, like, see where I'm at, and then, like, go run and tell him where I'm at, and then they'd run it over.
532872	534072	Talk about screen lookers.
534112	535273	Come on, that's just straight-up shit.
535473	537334	What a bunch of gossipy bitches.
537374	540635	You don't think brosy straight guys can be gossipy bitches?
542476	546398	Get Call of Duty in the mix and we all understand that.
547079	548479	No offense, but offense.
550320	553321	I played... Man, what were my early dial-up days?
553421	554702	I remember a lot of Warcraft 2.
555863	559724	I know I played Shadow Warrior once or twice with a friend of mine.
560065	561905	I feel like we had to have played Duke Nukem.
562206	562406	They're...
563666	565488	Some game of its ilk at the time.
565528	568069	There was definitely another first-person shooter I played a couple times.
568609	570310	For the life of me, I can't remember what it was.
570891	571651	Probably Duke Nukem.
571771	576294	TigerClaw in the chat room reminding us, I got Duke Nukem 3D when Good Old Games gave it away.
577335	579116	God bless Good Old Games for giving that away.
579296	582058	I actually got that too, so I'm very thankful about that.
582098	590363	The reason why I also want it on Steam, but I want to get it on sale when it's only like three bucks, is because they have that multiplayer coming, which, you know, the Good Old Games one is great, but
590623	594947	but they're trying to add to it for the Steam one, so that's what I'm trying to get in on.
594987	596388	So actually, clue me in on this.
597569	602414	Has Duke Nukem multiplayer on PC not been a thing at all yet?
604015	607258	In, of course, the modern remakes, DOSBox emulation, that kind of stuff.
607278	608679	Well, you should still be able to land it.
610100	612743	Because, like, Loki, do you know?
614084	614985	It's just not easy.
615373	616094	This is not easy.
616554	617495	It's not what he used to be.
617535	617935	I think.
617955	618575	I mean, I don't know.
618595	619516	I haven't messed with it.
619736	622078	This dream says Duke Nukem Gossipy Bitches Edition.
622898	629283	Because I was going to say that I played a Duke match not long ago, but now that I think about it, that was probably on Xbox 360 after I picked that up.
629663	630064	Oh, yeah.
630084	630664	That was on.
631024	644074	And yeah, I guess games of those time were built for like IPX and NetBIOS and all of this other ridiculous out-of-date nonsense that predates, you know, LAN parties in the stable way that they are now.
645151	646892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
663143	664464	It is a bit of a slow news week.
665245	670569	We had a pretty major holiday happen this past week and things that people are celebrating, a lot of people traveling.
670910	672851	So there was not a lot of gaming news this week.
673152	679937	We'll get to what there is in a moment, but this is the time of year where a lot of people talk about what was your top games of the year.
680318	684161	So I want to start that same conversation here at Orange Lounge Radio, the top video games of 2013.
685322	689546	But a very important difference, what we're trying to do here, here at Orange Lounge Radio, we want to talk about
690306	704893	our or as the case may be your favorite games of 2013 meaning there are no right or wrong answers we're not trying to say this is the list and shut the hell up we'll do that later in list list because that is where we do the scientific list and the way things are
705433	708435	But for this, this is just about, hey, these were my favorite.
708895	710716	And so there's no right or wrong answers.
710796	713417	So I just want to know, like, what were your favorite games of the year?
713698	716219	Chatters, if you want to play along, shout them out in the chat room.
716239	717139	Your one, two, and three.
717179	719281	What were your top three games of 2013?
719441	723543	And to be honest, guys, they didn't have to be released in 2013.
723903	729566	They could be any time if it was something you really got into this year because it made 2013 for you.
729586	729626	So...
733348	734869	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
749919	752041	Fractal, Make Blooms Not War Fractal, Make Blooms Not War
772858	776619	That is actually a game I got into a little bit when you sent that to me.
776899	779179	I did play a pretty good amount of time one night.
779799	782060	It was a really kind of different puzzle.
782100	785880	It reminds me of the old school games of life that were on the Commodore 64.
786060	789021	And I'm not talking about the board game version with the wheel and the car with the pegs.
789401	795382	I'm talking about like this dot will survive if surrounded by other dots, but not too many.
795682	798823	And you just see these really very pretty patterns that bloom from that.
798843	800943	And it was almost like that idea, like as a puzzler.
800963	801043	Yeah.
801323	801923	was really cool.
801943	804464	Well, especially with the ambient music that plays in the background.
805304	810765	It's... I'm trying to think of the right way to phrase it.
812225	813425	Yeah, that's it.
813885	817306	This game is actually from 2010, believe it or not.
817666	824867	But it was offered as parts of bundles in 2012 and 2013, so it kind of came to more prevalence later.
824947	827247	And I'll tell you what, I have a different game that did come out this year.
827908	829628	And that's Legend of Zelda Late Between Worlds.
830048	830488	Ah, okay.
830848	832189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
847276	848657	It is, but it still makes me motion sick.
848997	849838	So I don't use it that often.
849918	858084	It's actually very disorienting, especially when you're... I love the switch in perspective when you jump from a higher plane to a lower plane.
858764	861566	Because the camera actually moves with you just a little bit.
862647	865669	But otherwise, I've been completely enjoying it.
865749	867511	That game is definitely on my list.
868211	869192	Alright.
869232	869652	Excellent.
869732	871794	Because I want to stick with stuff that came out this year.
872214	872774	Okay.
872815	874155	Fair enough.
874556	876037	Loki, what's your number three pick?
877117	883641	My number three pick is going to be probably... It's kind of a toss-up.
884082	886223	It almost sounds like a three-way tie for number three.
886443	888404	We'll have a time to talk about honorable mentions later.
889145	890245	Okay, so let's see.
890446	897370	I'll probably do... I was going to go by how long I played games, but let's do Saints Row 4.
897570	897750	Okay.
899431	900412	Just because it was...
901054	906617	I like Saints Row, but it was a little bit of a disappointment just because it seemed like it was kind of rushed.
908037	909438	But I still enjoyed it.
909678	918102	It's just frustrating that I know it, having played all of the entire series, I know how good it could be.
918442	924945	It's disappointing to see that it didn't quite make it there, mainly to where Saints Row 2 and 3 would have been.
925445	929607	It had potential, so hopefully the next Saints Row that comes out will be much better, but
930263	930944	It's still pretty good.
931925	932285	All right.
932846	936049	And you did talk an awful lot about that game, all the good and the bad.
936509	938852	So it doesn't surprise me at all that that is in your top three.
940153	942896	Jason, I don't know if you were wanting to do this tonight.
942936	945858	I know you tend to play a lot more of the phone games, the classics.
945898	947400	Do you have three games from this year?
947780	955787	Um, based off going, like the only way I can really gauge it is going based off the kind of things that I've been talking about a lot, and I think I've come up with a 1, 2, and 3.
955827	956007	Okay.
956548	969339	So, number 3, I'm going to give to FTL, Faster Than Light, because I've not had, like, despite how much I complain about that game, if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be playing it.
970459	973480	And it's, you know, it's not particularly puzzly.
973680	995086	It's kind of Twitch action because it's overriding theme more than anything else is management of individuals because the pathfinding, yeah, whatever, the attacking isn't exactly... You can drill down and make things a little bit more difficult and a little bit more complicated and directed, but it's just a good...
996906	998389	I don't even want to call it a godsend.
998489	1007928	It's really hard to pin down, but it's just a satisfying, nearly mindless, but not if you don't want it to be kind of adventure game.
1008277	1009678	You know, I need to check this game out.
1009698	1013439	This is one of those games I've always been meaning to check out, especially because it's sort of like a roguelike.
1013920	1017101	But just to be clear, this game was released in September of 2012.
1017601	1020463	Well, it really doesn't matter.
1020483	1023504	Because again, like how many games, and you know, it's so funny.
1024224	1027266	Who was it on Twitter posted their top 10?
1027386	1028506	Who does Twisted Metal?
1028626	1029166	David Jaffe?
1029327	1029767	Is that his name?
1030847	1031728	The guy does Twisted Metal.
1031828	1032048	Loki.
1032768	1033669	Yeah, that's him.
1034309	1035630	I don't know how to pronounce his last name.
1035990	1044156	He posted his top 10 of the year, and Sonic Racing, the one that came out last year technically, the one with Danica Packard and all that.
1044316	1050700	Sonic All-Stars Adventure Racing, whatever was in his list, and everybody was like, you idiot, that came out in 2012, boo.
1051000	1054122	But it's like, okay, but there's so many games.
1054283	1055984	How big is your backlog, people?
1056024	1059286	There's still games like Stanley Parable I just said, I need to get around to playing that still.
1059526	1062487	I've played less than 25% of my Steam library.
1062847	1063447	Exactly.
1063507	1067328	Mass Effect, I did not discover my love for until like four years after the fact.
1067368	1068648	So, you know, these things happen.
1068688	1070029	So I just want to make very clear.
1070309	1074810	We're not trying to come up with like some journalistic, this is the best of the best.
1075130	1075490	It's no.
1075510	1077631	These are our gaming years.
1077651	1080111	And FTL definitely ranked up there quite quick.
1080632	1081552	I haven't played in a couple of weeks.
1081612	1082252	I need to change that.
1082372	1085213	When we get that tweet that's like, why did Jason put a 2012 game on his list?
1085253	1086033	I'm going to go ballistic.
1086113	1087194	I'm going to say, weren't you listening?
1087754	1088014	All right.
1088874	1089935	Listen to all the other words.
1089975	1090475	Come on.
1090595	1094636	But you do remind me I need to check that one out as old as the game may be getting at this point.
1094656	1095737	It's still quite fun.
1095877	1096237	Very fun.
1096457	1096657	All right.
1096677	1097077	Very fun.
1097657	1098878	I guess just me's left, right?
1098938	1099098	Okay.
1099138	1099798	My number three pick.
1100138	1105240	My number three pick is Super Mario 3D World on the Wii U, which is...
1105961	1109685	God, the Mario games are damn near always rock solid games.
1109805	1122000	I mean, there's a reason why people eat up anything with Mario in the title because especially when it's the main series games, the platformer games, they are almost always, without fail, some of the best games to come out for the year.
1122520	1123762	A few exceptions here and there.
1124182	1127725	but Mario 3D World is by no means an exception.
1127765	1129226	It is one of the best of the year.
1129967	1137133	I did not know how a 3D game was going to go over on the Wii U because it's not in 3D but they made it work out very well.
1137433	1144819	I love the return of the classic styles of Princess Peach and Luigi and so forth from Super Mario 2.
1145920	1150964	I think the level design is fantastic and especially later on it just gets better
1150964	1151364	and DarkSakura.
1174346	1176708	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1204502	1208023	because that game sort of snuck up on me and I'll tell you how I heard about it.
1208503	1210064	It was actually through a parody.
1210644	1215926	Not really a parody, but it was a response to an email that the game creator had about it.
1216386	1223868	And so he had the narrator narrate the response and the letter about this guy being a major douchebag who emailed about it.
1224148	1226269	I was like, why did you say Stanley so many times?
1227253	1228454	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1255911	1260912	I just sort of, you know, try to do stuff now to spite the narrator and it's so fun.
1261673	1263393	So the Stanley Parable gets my number two.
1263953	1275776	When you have like a little sarcastic antagonist slash protagonist slash do I root for this bad guy or not type character like you had in Portal for sure, I notice you tend to love those types as a lot of people do.
1275796	1277337	So that doesn't surprise me at all.
1277957	1281619	I like games that are mockeries of other things.
1281759	1287862	I'm a big fan of satire, and it seems to me that a great deal... I mean, well, hello, I like Homestuck.
1288723	1294005	But I mean, I like anything that is both a satire and homage to a genre.
1294425	1301669	So I've been having a good time with The Stanley Parable, and I think that it's something that if you haven't played yet, you definitely need to play it.
1302226	1307087	Actdeft in our chatroom saying, playing the Stanley Parable makes me kind of anxious, but it's so good.
1307408	1308228	It really is good.
1308408	1309188	It's such a great game.
1309728	1316990	And that, and I just want to send a message to, we should get the narrator from the Stanley Parable to do a bumper for us.
1317310	1319011	If they would, I would love that.
1319091	1321651	That would be amazing for the VOG Network.
1321812	1324952	Orange Zones Radio asked me to do a bumper, and I said, well, sure.
1326713	1327453	Excellent, excellent.
1328333	1328813	Who's up next?
1328833	1329394	How about Loki?
1329454	1330574	Loki, what's your number two pick?
1331223	1333545	My number two is going to be Bioshock Infinite.
1335466	1343632	It was a great game and had a lot of moments in it where it was just very awe-inspiring, I guess.
1344152	1349196	And the ending was very satisfying, I guess.
1349816	1352598	So definitely Bioshock Infinite for number two.
1353639	1354800	I like games that have moments.
1356441	1358222	The very beginning, you don't even have to wait that long.
1359043	1361004	Within the first two minutes, it's just like,
1361519	1363616	Whoa, that's pretty powerful.
1364520	1367022	Well, I didn't want to get into my gaming week too much.
1367042	1372466	I was going to save this for a little later, but I will say I did finally jump in and play Bioshock Infinite for the first time this week.
1373567	1377890	I was lucky enough to get it as a gift on Steam, and I was like, all right, it's about freaking time I finally play this game.
1378430	1383314	And I was blown away by the graphics.
1383554	1385275	They are so good.
1385495	1391780	And the atmosphere of the Columbia is fantastic.
1391820	1394282	Like, you know, I played the first Bioshock, and I was like, oh, this is...
1394562	1403409	This is alright, and I see why people are into it, you know, the more the story unfolded and so forth, but this one just, not to be crass, but it had me by the balls from the very beginning.
1403449	1419381	It was so good, and the way the environment is and all the things to look at and the story behind it, like, DarkSakura, I think if you could handle the first-person shooter, I mean, it's unfortunate, you know, you have the sickness, but I think you'd be really into this, too, because there's so much of the lore.
1419401	1420562	I do have the sickness.
1421063	1422764	The lore and the culture with it is just...
1423084	1424784	No, I know I want to play it.
1424904	1425544	I have it.
1425684	1427565	I've had it for a while.
1428205	1429585	So I definitely want to.
1429725	1433466	It's just... There's some very uncomfortable things.
1433506	1436206	I know some of you guys have probably heard about the controversies in the game and so forth.
1436226	1438807	There's some very uncomfortable things in there about America's history.
1438827	1439227	I'm from Alabama.
1439267	1439827	I can deal with it.
1439967	1452109	I know, but it's done in a very tasteful way for a story that pushes it forward without it being shocking, if that makes sense.
1452990	1454031	It is shocking.
1454091	1455753	It seemed really realistic to me.
1456073	1466665	I mean, if you've ever looked at any photos from America's history, or even not just America, but other places in the world, it's something that it's very period specific.
1467813	1489627	so unfortunately it didn't make my top three probably because I got into it too late in the year but it would definitely be one of my honorable mentions of a late add to my list but anyway Loki not to derail what you were saying but it's just I I had to get that out there that I played it this week and I was just I was I was so in love with it it's it's great okay all right I know do you have anything to add Loki
1490402	1492003	All the DLC was this year
1513257	1524486	Yeah, and that's actually what I'm basing this off of is that I made a point a couple of episodes ago back when the PS4 was coming out or just after the Xbox One was out, one of the two, close enough together.
1524686	1542721	At any rate, one of the things that's been really interesting to me is that because online is ubiquitous everywhere, we are truly starting to see video game communities in the video game and not, you know, like fan forums and that kind of stuff that has a very serious disconnect from the game.
1543962	1548425	I keep wanting to say Bioshock because we were going on and on about that and I want to play that too.
1548485	1555931	Because Borderlands is multiplayer and has a lot of work put into it to make sure that the experience of playing together is good.
1556471	1565238	Not to mention the randomness of the loot and the DLC and the keys that Shift gives out and everything else that's going into that game.
1565679	1569081	There are a lot of video game communities but Borderlands 2...
1570282	1579874	is the first one that I know of that's console specific that's putting in a lot of work into maintaining original content and the health of that community at large.
1580458	1580738	The Lich King
1605769	1605929	No.
1606309	1606689	Close.
1606909	1609890	Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn is my number two pick for Game of the Year.
1610490	1615972	And, you know, Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 was one of the most awful MMOs ever made.
1616172	1616992	That is no secret.
1617573	1624975	So the fact that they were able to bring in a new producer who has worked utter magic with this because not only was he able to take...
1625655	1626536	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1644238	1650222	Back the car into the spot, so to speak, of, oh, but we've got to make sure 1.0 kind of continues into this.
1650282	1652563	And the things that everybody started at 1.0 have to carry over.
1652984	1656746	That was a miracle in gaming that they did with that game.
1656786	1658907	It is gorgeous to look at.
1659007	1659808	It's fun to play.
1660328	1664731	And it is probably going to be one of the best MMOs of this decade.
1664751	1668954	Because if you think about it, I mean, World of Warcraft, still have a great love for that community.
1669434	1670315	All love that game.
1671135	1675340	I canceled my account this week, I'm sorry to say, because I've been paying for two MMOs.
1675740	1680085	Final Fantasy XIV, Rome Reborn is where it's at for me right now, and WoW is an eight-year-old game.
1680726	1681227	End of an era.
1681467	1682448	Running on that engine.
1682748	1683930	It is in a way.
1684070	1688495	I don't even think the new expansion is going to be enough to make me want to go back.
1688655	1716507	it's one of those I'll check it out but we'll see and it's just you know I'm so excited about like a lot of the stuff that's going on in A Realm Reborn right now especially with the latest patch and so forth it's just like I think it is kind of the end of an era just as and to be fair before the angry blizzard mob comes at me with their pitchforks and torches just as I when I left Final Fantasy 11 to go to World of Warcraft that was the end of an era you know this is what's next the pendulum has swung and now we're on the other side
1717458	1720259	Did I mention the soundtrack is so flippin' good?
1720939	1723480	Unless you get tired of listening to the Chocobo music the whole time.
1723800	1736766	I might have actually been playing Final Fantasy XIV right before this very show tonight, and I was running a Titan Kill, which those of you that have played the game know you have to kill the... I'm not even talking about the level 35 one, I'm talking about the one... See, that's the one I'm on right now.
1736786	1737626	The one at level 50?
1738186	1738686	Oh my god.
1739187	1740427	Oh my god, look up a YouTube of the fight.
1740507	1741007	It's crazy.
1741127	1743908	And the music is like this rock song that's like...
1745729	1769628	that's like death metal that plays in the background and it's like your heart is beating so fast like I know Alan could probably hear me from the other room like every time I got hit with something I shouldn't have it's like fuck motherfucker piece of shit god damn you know it's just like I have Tourette's or something sitting there playing this game but I'm just like that into it and I was playing with a fun group of people uh funny enough um uh Darlena who's one of the hosts over on all games of um
1770508	1771908	I'm going to mess up the name of this show.
1771948	1772829	I'm so embarrassed.
1772889	1779170	Kat and Fox, I think she's one of the hosts of that show, I was playing with in a group, and we were having a lot of fun.
1779830	1783871	And I helped one of their friends get a Titan weapon, or Relic plus one, so that was good.
1784591	1793853	That was actually fun with Final Fantasy XI was changing up the music because you could kind of mod it a little bit and add your own tracks and where different songs were.
1794073	1798014	So I had Otherworld from Final Fantasy X as my fight...
1798530	1799310	Thank you for watching!
1813407	1818929	SSU100 Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, You kept wondering what would be the WoW killer for many years.
1819109	1822570	So do you feel that Final Fantasy XIV killed it or did WoW kill itself?
1823190	1825591	I don't think WoW is dead by a long shot.
1825671	1827492	Are they hemorrhaging subscribers in a way?
1827672	1827912	Yes.
1827992	1830313	But are they still the biggest MMO four times over?
1830493	1831013	Absolutely.
1831353	1833254	And there's still a great community over there.
1833794	1835515	I may be finally tired of the game.
1835635	1839036	So in that regard, yes, WoW is killing itself because it's not...
1839736	1841537	It's not innovating fast enough.
1860843	1879210	and I know Blizzard has a reputation of it will get out there when it's done and when we rush things something like what happened with Diablo 3 will happen and I understand that but you look at something like Hearthstone as well Hearthstone is a great game it is moving too slow why is that game still in beta?
1879530	1879790	why?
1880390	1904471	are they they're still balancing things really it is moving too slow it is time to open up that beta and just just open launch the damn game is it if you have to still balance some cards is it really that big of an issue because most MMOs out there still need fixing but I mean it's not I think the game's in fine enough shape and it's not even just MMOs Blizzard's entire catalog is balanced once every month basically
1904651	1932576	and this may just be the difference that 10 years makes or whatever where that whole mantra for Blizzard where it's like oh we'll just take time until it's right I'm not saying don't take the time to get it right but I'm saying move a little faster you guys I'm sorry it's just that's the reality they're not moving fast enough I don't think anything's changed in that regard I think they still can take their time because they have three solid IPs that are not they're by no means close to danger
1932856	1935777	Okay, fair point, because does it work for Diablo?
1935837	1936077	Yes.
1936257	1936777	StarCraft?
1936837	1937017	Yes.
1937177	1937657	Hearthstone?
1937697	1937877	Yes.
1938278	1941178	A game where you're asking... I actually wasn't counting Hearthstone.
1941519	1942219	You said it yourself.
1942299	1943239	WoW is still strong.
1943599	1947360	But between WoW, Diablo, and StarCraft, they are very healthy right now.
1947520	1949681	It's strong, but it is losing steam.
1949841	1953502	And the difference there is you are asking people to pay a monthly fee for World of Warcraft.
1953702	1958884	And it's like... And not only that, but then you nickel and dime them with the server changes, which...
1961225	1961565	I get it.
1961605	1962826	Final Fantasy XIV does it too.
1962926	1964067	They make their money or whatever.
1964668	1968511	But I just think it's moving too slow.
1968891	1971733	Like you want me to pay for eight months while I wait for an expansion?
1971793	1974656	Like no, I'll quit and then maybe if the expansion is good I'll come back at that point.
1975557	1976177	That's the reality.
1977058	1979420	By which you mean you will come back for at least a month to find out.
1979500	1980341	Yeah, of course.
1980401	1981301	We'll see.
1981662	1981942	We'll see.
1984053	1985253	Alright, anyhow, moving on.
1985694	1986514	Let's get to number one.
1986534	1987354	Number one!
1987394	1989034	That's right, numero uno.
1989814	1993815	DarkSakura, your number one pick for game of the year.
1994595	1995336	Animal Crossing.
1996936	1998356	Why am I not surprised?
1998716	2001277	I've played this game, like, addictive.
2001797	2002537	It's so crazy.
2003817	2005498	I have friends that play with me.
2005778	2006398	Hi, Actdeft.
2008194	2009134	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2028360	2039306	and I was thinking about it too that, you know, I've been using it to help Julian with his reading and to bribe him into paying attention to other people but it's got appeal for all ages.
2039586	2041987	I really have been enjoying my game.
2042928	2044889	I also may have finished my wine before you did.
2045589	2046230	Like all of it.
2047270	2047931	It was really good.
2049471	2050312	Rob, wine!
2051716	2053277	Loki, your number one pick of the year
2078576	2079718	We wouldn't want you to die.
2079838	2082842	So yes, it is going to be Grand Theft Auto V. Of course!
2083062	2083663	Of course!
2084484	2085446	I mean, what else would it be?
2085886	2088951	Yeah, I mean, it is a great game and I love it.
2089071	2091935	And they're still making it better.
2092916	2093297	That's it.
2093938	2095380	Grand Theft Auto V. Not a surprise.
2095802	2102664	And if you want to know more about why Loki picked Grand Theft Auto V as his game of the year, just go back to the previous 15 episodes of the show or so since the game came out.
2103524	2105365	Basically, I was going to say exactly the same thing.
2105625	2106005	There it is.
2106665	2109606	Jason, you're number uno, number one.
2110046	2116148	If for no other reason than because of the last two weeks, definitely, certainly, completely Rogue Legacy.
2117808	2122410	I've been having, especially with a controller now, like it was always a fun game on the keyboard.
2123450	2147786	and I just kind of live for that adventure, random, twitch, roguelike, platformer just all things together, the music and everything else I've been having so much fun with that game throw in a controller, I've been using the PS4 controller religiously like every day since I've started, since I got it and actually got it to work it's been insane amounts of fun and I'm thinking that when it's out on...
2149227	2170373	I'm thinking when it's out on two systems that I don't have and one system back home that I'll get back to eventually, those being the PS Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, I may buy it again because just to have the console experience from the ground up, not to mention there's some very, very frustrating Mac bugs with Rogue Legacy, but besides the point...
2172393	2201777	more specifically I've had a conversation with a friend or two in the last couple of days I kind of want to get a Vita for a number of reasons and that's basically Playstation 1 classics and some of the newer games being able to play them portably just seems like a worthy investment and that's always what it is for me with consoles rather with portables is that when I can play something anywhere I love to be able to do so and Rogue Legacy may tip me into that purchase and so for that very reason that's my number one pick
2203178	2207323	It sure did.
2207843	2208604	It's a great pick.
2208884	2209465	It really is.
2210626	2216733	I was listening to the show on the way up here, of course, and I was listening to you and Bobby talking about it in the handoff, and...
2217708	2221349	It's... Like anything else, it kind of has that first little hurdle.
2223029	2226530	Grinding pays off and this game doesn't stretch it out unreasonably.
2227590	2235232	But it's actually... It's coming around a second time because I'm at a point where I like to clear the entirety of the areas.
2235972	2243154	I posted a screenshot to Steam two nights ago or something like that that I finally, for the first time...
2243954	2244574	Thanks for watching!
2266684	2283139	I'm in a good place right now it's a good way further than I am that's for sure and it's just managing the upgrades and figuring out how I want to proceed from there and finally taking on the third boss and holding my own for more than like 30 seconds but yeah very fun game and so much fun
2283866	2284166	Awesome.
2285227	2288270	My number one game of the year will probably not come as a huge surprise.
2288830	2300800	And, you know, I mentioned on November 23rd, which was the day that the Xbox One came out, I said, isn't it funny that Nintendo today released two games that are damn near contenders for the game of the year?
2301361	2304824	And sure enough, both those games released ended up in my top three.
2304864	2309768	You had Super Mario 3D World at number three, and The Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Two Worlds, at number one.
2309828	2310809	Because that game...
2311629	2313310	is my fucking game of the year.
2315011	2318073	And I think some of this is a little bit personal as well.
2319154	2328119	I know that some big outlets put it in their number one to such controversy, but good for them because it's my number one too.
2328159	2331221	And I'm going to tell you, the way that they took...
2332322	2336467	One of my top five retro favorites of all time, period.
2337147	2347738	And brought it into not like a remake or even a reimagining, but just another story, a chapter two in that game that you love, but now...
2348439	2351081	It's got all that new technology of the current console.
2351441	2359066	Like the way that it moved seamlessly from Super Nintendo to 3DS is just... It's so right.
2359226	2361408	And it feels so great to play.
2362028	2363889	And I love some of the changes they made to it.
2363909	2368773	I know some of the things were controversial where you rent the weapons now and you can do the dungeons in any order.
2368793	2370674	But I think that's cool.
2370794	2372235	And I think it makes for a different...
2372695	2375077	and more Mega Man-esque Legend of Zelda, if you will.
2375117	2376739	You know, it's something a little bit different.
2377059	2379101	But it is such a fun adventure to play.
2379361	2382283	And I loved every second of it that I've played it.
2382483	2389970	And it is a Link to the Past wink for me that I loved.
2390290	2394593	And I just, yeah, fantastic game in my game of the year.
2394814	2398697	For the record, you could actually do two of the levels in Link to the Past out of order.
2400453	2404095	The Last of Us, Hands Down, My Game of the Year, The Game Speaks for Itself
2429632	2433133	Tech2030 says, Tales of Xillia, for sure.
2433333	2437975	I clocked in like 50 hours in that game, and I'm about to go back in for a second time.
2438895	2443337	Let's see some other number ones here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2445638	2448399	I think I got mixed in with the number twos here.
2448559	2451920	There were a bunch of people that did theirs in bulk at the start of all this.
2452020	2477479	Yeah, that's where I got to SG-100, Matt agrees, Grand Theft Auto 5 Degenerate Johnny says Dark Souls Code Man says Super Mario 3D World and Dark Tetsuya says Super Mario 3D World So there's a sampling of some of the answers there in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Open forum for a minute Honorable mentions, some games that didn't make your top three but they really deserve a shout out here as well Jamie
2478697	2480178	I'm gonna say the stupid Pokemon.
2481619	2487244	Just because it was the first ones that I actually wanted in a while, and I'm having fun with it so far.
2487324	2487885	It's cute.
2488105	2489226	It's Pokemon.
2489626	2490567	I like roller skates.
2491848	2495351	I don't like that every time you accidentally bump into a chair, you sit on it.
2496092	2497833	But other than that, I'm not too frustrated with.
2497993	2499675	And I also don't like the 50,007 Pikachus.
2499695	2500535	57,000 Pikachus.
2503698	2504699	But I wanted a Pikachu.
2504719	2508062	That's the one that people want, so why not give it to them?
2508182	2511445	And then you see nothing but Pikachu for another year.
2511665	2513387	True, and that's all that's in the world trade.
2514047	2517090	Loki, you mentioned you were trying to decide between a few games there.
2517110	2518091	What are your honorable mentions?
2519292	2521974	Let's see, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.
2522875	2523476	I just bought that.
2524717	2525317	It looks pretty awesome.
2525337	2529241	Yeah, I bought that too, and then I was like, I have to do Uplay.
2529881	2530782	I forgot about that.
2531617	2545975	um and then let's see the Stanley Parable probably be another one um oh that's pretty much it Jason because I couldn't find a place for it in the top three and just because it
2547756	2548917	I have another game, Little Inferno
2576548	2592434	You were talking a lot about that game when it first came out, I remember that I mean, it's worth a playthrough at least once The combos are hilarious But once you get past that, it's sort of like weird But it was really fun, I liked it Oh, and Limbo Limbo was fun
2594201	2610536	I just want to note for some honorable mentions I have as well I don't know if you have some extras Jason but some honorable mentions I have as well I think the first half of this year was usually the first half of the year is not as strong as it was this year but we had some great games just in the first three months of this year
2611116	2612177	and many, many more.
2636516	2647299	and is making a lot of people's year-end list and with good reason because it was so great to finally... It's like you play a game like Tomb Raider and you're like, yes, this is the Tomb Raider I wanted to play.
2647399	2648259	This is great.
2648279	2651460	Tomb Raider is definitely the most... Yeah, and it looks gorgeous.
2651540	2656121	And I, for one, I'm kind of excited about the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One version.
2656141	2660482	I mean, yes, it's a little weird to have a remake of a game that was just out, but at the same time, it's like...
2660902	2664583	With even more power, I'm really excited to see what they're going to pull off.
2664883	2667344	So I loved Tomb Raider.
2667564	2668884	I do need to add another one on my list, too.
2669184	2669684	Skullgirls.
2670345	2670825	Oh, of course.
2670865	2671445	For fighting games.
2671485	2672285	That one was really fun.
2672585	2672925	Of course.
2673606	2674286	Jason, any others?
2674346	2677627	I didn't mean to cut you off a minute ago, but Hotline Miami.
2678467	2678787	Oh, good one.
2678807	2679987	Which I haven't put enough time into.
2680948	2682568	I just bought that for Dan because it was a dollar.
2684447	2686028	More things to throw out in the chat room here.
2686588	2686908	Let's see.
2686948	2687809	Some honorable mentions.
2687869	2697575	Dungeon Buster says Metal Gear Solid Revengeance, Tomb Raider, Tech 2030 says Ni No Kuni, Tomb Raider, Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite were all first three months.
2697655	2698596	That was crazy.
2699236	2702859	Cialis' Pokemon XY, SteamWorld Dig, Team Fortress 2.
2702979	2704320	There's still a lot of people.
2704440	2705821	Hey, there are still a lot of people playing that.
2706241	2708983	Awesome Unicorn, Guacamelee.
2709003	2710224	Guacamelee is great fun.
2711024	2713346	And DarkSakura, you mentioned you just bought that.
2714076	2715818	Shadowrun Returns, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition
2735061	2739383	SSJ100 Matt, Don't Starve, Poker Night 2, Pokemon XY, and DuckTales Remastered.
2739443	2740883	Oh yeah, DuckTales.
2741063	2745445	As much as the cutscene thing bothered me, the game was a lot of fun.
2746405	2748906	And the new level was frustratingly hard.
2749406	2751747	I have another game that is definitely an honorable mention.
2753067	2753807	Not really.
2753827	2756408	Vesuvius was crazy.
2756568	2757909	This is because of my heart.
2759949	2760670	Namco High.
2761070	2761190	Shh.
2762395	2763375	No, seriously!
2764055	2768237	It's like such a... You know me and parodies and satires and tributes and things.
2768897	2770017	I fucking love that game.
2770217	2773038	It makes me laugh every time I play it.
2773358	2783561	Just knowing the characters from the obscure Namco titles and the Homestuck characters in it and playing as the cousin of the Prince of All Cosmos.
2784321	2787962	It's just so crazy that it's stupidly fun.
2788302	2792923	Not quite enough to make it into my top three, but definitely has a warm, fuzzy place in my heart.
2793723	2794063	All righty.
2795323	2796263	All right, well, good discussion.
2796323	2796903	Lots of great games.
2796923	2798404	This is a very good year for games.
2798584	2805725	And on top of that, you get two new consoles, and I'm sure they're going to really start to roll out some of the heavy hitters next year and the year after.
2805785	2808065	We already know that because of the delays, unfortunately.
2808305	2808565	Sure.
2808605	2811626	Next year is going to be a great resurgence...
2812386	2813467	All of our poor wallets, collectively.
2834898	2836719	Well, you know, you have things on PlayStation 4.
2837120	2841262	You have, what was that, The Order, the one about the wolves and all that that looked really cool.
2841402	2842303	They were shown at E3.
2842623	2845565	And then you have Infamous Second Son is next year as well.
2845645	2847326	And there's a lot of great stuff on PlayStation.
2847346	2847947	Drive Club.
2848247	2849868	Drive Club finally coming next year.
2850328	2854651	Xbox One has the Quantum Break, the new Halo.
2854691	2856292	You know, it's going to be the holiday thing next year.
2857433	2858974	Lots of great things on there as well.
2859034	2862116	And then, you know, I'm sure the current-gen consoles aren't stopping either.
2862557	2864658	There's going to be another Mass Effect game.
2865000	2892386	and then of course Nintendo on Planet Nintendo where they do things Nintendo's way they will have Mario Kart 8 is going to be huge a lot of people theorizing they'll at least tease the next Zelda if it's not out next holiday Smash Brothers will probably be a big holiday one for sure and who knows what else from Planet Nintendo I expect that game to be more like mid-year there's no way they're going to take it to holiday season next year but maybe we should save predictions for later
2893266	2894026	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2915385	2943879	I played some stuff Animal Crossing and I played some Final Fantasy 14 and I got some of my old school friends into Final Fantasy 14 people from my Digimon days and stuff and words and other games I bought a bunch of games that I haven't started I played some Fractal I played some Mass Effect 3 I played some Mass Effect 2 because basically I have a new computer
2944918	2947901	Oh yeah, that was your holiday gift, huh?
2948082	2950885	Not really the computer, the guts in it are new.
2951005	2952967	The case, the motherboard, the processor.
2953828	2959033	The only things that we carried over from my old computer were my graphics card, my power supply, and my hard drive.
2959874	2962317	Because I already have a 3TB external storage as well.
2963057	2963097	Ha!
2989692	3012584	with my new processor and everything the installs like they don't take long at all because first of all we have our own router so we get better speeds with our router and everything and then my computer is so fast now that and then Dan just took all the old guts and threw together a new computer because we had the extras he's like let's give this one to my mom there you go
3014318	3014838	That's what he said.
3015879	3020381	So, I've just been playing just random things, really.
3020601	3021882	And more Namco High.
3022902	3024223	Because that game is crack.
3026084	3026904	I think that's it.
3027845	3028565	Loki, how about you?
3028625	3029406	How was your gaming week?
3031186	3032547	Well, I bought a lot of things.
3034448	3035969	I played a few things this week.
3036089	3038270	Actually, surprisingly enough, not Grand Theft Auto 4.
3039807	3067895	and that's kind of surprising because they had their holiday thing where they had it snowing and everything and just didn't get a chance to play it that's because it's buried under cores right now I did play I played Duke Nukem forever and it was terrible unfortunately it kept crashing every single level it would crash every single level so after about
3069046	3072368	7 levels, I said, fuck it, and I installed the game.
3072448	3073269	I'm done with it.
3073889	3075230	It's not good in any way.
3075630	3079392	It's just, it's absolutely terrible.
3080093	3081894	It's not what Duke Nukem games should be.
3082274	3083575	There's no point to it.
3083855	3088058	It seems like they're more fascinating with, hey, what kind of interactive things can we make?
3088518	3093501	Alright, cool, look, we made all these light switches and shit you can do that you don't really need to even mess with.
3093541	3095202	And then the game's just very basic looking.
3095803	3096624	It just looks old.
3097044	3099005	I don't know how to really describe beyond that.
3101106	3101947	Other things I played.
3101967	3108211	I played a little bit of a brand new game I bought, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.
3108431	3112193	Now, this is an indie game, and it's kind of cool.
3112253	3122039	It's a cross between almost like a 30-second hero and like a shooter and the Oregon Trail.
3123067	3152332	so you're in a wagon like the Oregon Trail and it's like day one you've encountered some wildlife go hunting and so your actual wagon is just shooting out bullets and you have to kill all these things and avoid hitting the animals and stuff and you collect meat that way and it just keeps popping up different random little mini games almost and it's just ridiculous it's a lot of fun and pretty cheap so I played that I played through the Stanley Parable
3153150	3154811	and quite a bit through that.
3154831	3168896	I think I've pretty much finished the game and I've gotten most of the achievements so far aside from some of the ridiculous ones like where you have to mod your date on your computer and stuff.
3169817	3177340	And then, let's see, I played a little bit of Just Cause 2 multiplayer.
3177360	3179641	A little bit more of that.
3179661	3180501	That was kind of fun.
3181221	3182422	I tried Proteus
3182912	3191338	which is kind of a very retro-looking 3D first-person, I don't know, art game, I guess.
3191398	3197382	There's not really a point to it, but I was just showing it to Josh because I wanted to show him a game that wasn't scary, I guess.
3198202	3201564	And so he dug that a bit, and it was neat.
3201805	3202605	I mean, I don't know.
3202765	3203486	It's very short.
3205467	3208449	And I think actually that's it.
3209059	3209679	FarCry3, BloodDragon
3234589	3263828	Don't Starve, Terraria, Left 4 Dead 2 because that was free, Operation Flashpoint Red River, Fuel, Overlord 2, Overlord, Operation Flashpoint 2 Dragon Rising, Clive Barker's Jericho, Damnation, Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, Super Hexagon, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Rise of the Triad, the new one, Cube, Gateways, Drastic Man Epic, Half-Life Source, kind of as a gift,
3264212	3278076	LaMulana, Blockland, Ballpoint Universe, Infinite, Retrograde, No Way to Love 2, The Evolution, Final Fantasy 7, The Stanley Parable, The Orange Box, and finally, actually from last week, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.
3278316	3278716	Jeez.
3279717	3279897	Yeah.
3280177	3280797	That's a good haul.
3282698	3283938	And it was only 60 bucks.
3285159	3286900	So averaging about two bucks a game.
3288061	3288701	You know what?
3289022	3295525	Considering that's the price of like one new Xbox One or PlayStation 4 game, that's doing really well for yourself.
3296126	3296346	Yeah.
3296466	3297927	Hours and hours of entertainment, so why not?
3298707	3301069	And supporting a lot of indie games in there too.
3301089	3306672	All right, my gaming week will be quick because I pretty much already talked about the big new one, which is Bioshock Infinite.
3306792	3308193	If I may, I also did buy Dust.
3308894	3309194	Oh, did you?
3309374	3311255	Yes, I did.
3311375	3323862	I did also play, besides just Bioshock Infinite, I did some virtual consoling on the Wii U because nobody told me that Legend of the Mystical Ninja had come out on the Wii U. That is like, even, okay.
3324682	3349317	that's one of those games like I loved it when it was out on the Super Nintendo like originally and I love the fact that you know you had the little towns and you had the like mini games you could play in the towns which by the way one of which Gradius you can play Gradius in Legend of the Skull Ninja it's a scaled down version of it but it's there so you know I love that game as a kid playing it now in retrospect I'm kind of like this game was kind of derpy but
3349837	3355721	But I adore it for its derpiness and for some of the things it tried to do.
3356362	3362646	I made a great Miiverse post that is right now the most popular post in the Legend of the Mystical Ninja community.
3363126	3366228	It was a screenshot of me playing Gradius.
3367069	3372492	And I put, look guys, I'm playing a virtual console game inside my virtual console game.
3372933	3374794	It's virtual console-ception, Horn.
3374954	3375955	It's got like 25 likes.
3376135	3378596	So my Miiverse moment of fame.
3378616	3378777	It's got 25.
3378837	3378897	Yay!
3380397	3381178	or whatever it's called.
3381218	3382178	So that's fun.
3382898	3383199	But yeah.
3383539	3384679	How about 55, huh?
3387200	3401026	Well, this is funny because for the first time ever, I finally got the joke in the game where there's a quiz show game that you can play where it asks you questions about the game in the first couple stages to see if you were paying attention.
3401666	3405608	And one of the questions is like, how many legs does the boss have?
3406288	3407689	And the answers are none.
3408709	3409450	2, and 573.
3410110	3415033	And for the longest time, you know, you think, oh, 573, that's silly because it's a big number.
3415053	3416393	Nothing has 573 legs.
3416413	3420936	But now looking back, you're like, oh, get it?
3421936	3423977	And yeah, which if you didn't know.
3424177	3425238	Thank you, Konami.
3425538	3427099	573 in Japanese.
3427199	3429780	If you abbreviate some things and kind of say it out loud.
3429800	3432842	You have to kind of take some liberties, but it is Konami, basically.
3432922	3434983	It'd be Go-na-na-mi-tsu.
3435723	3459277	so there you go but yeah you have to take some liberties but that's why Konami's kind of always married with the number 573 so there you go um let's see I think that was about oh then I also played uh Castlevania and because that came out on virtual console a few weeks ago and I just never picked it up until now and uh yeah that's between that Bioshock Infinite Final Fantasy 14 that was a week so there you go uh last but not least Jason your gaming week
3460270	3460750	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3482580	3483541	Many, many, many years ago.
3483561	3485722	I haven't heard much out of her, but I saw something on her wish list.
3485762	3486362	Oh, I still talk to her.
3486462	3487223	She's still around.
3487403	3487643	Oh, yeah.
3487663	3490285	She's on Steam, and I just added her on 3DS a couple days ago.
3490305	3493827	I don't know if she's an active listener anymore, because I think she's just kind of... Just not in the chat.
3494247	3496729	But she does have a very neat blog called The Eco Maker.
3497029	3497269	Yes.
3497830	3503173	So check it out, people, because if you're into doing DIY things on the cheap...
3504054	3516124	Well, they were, and I don't think she would mind me repeating, they were having some hard times a few months ago, and so, you know, they were really thinking like, you know, how can we do some things short-cutting, so a lot of great ideas in this blog on how to do it on the cheap.
3516604	3517585	So, yeah, it's a good blog.
3518246	3518426	Anyway.
3519006	3528449	I, amusingly enough, I don't even remember what I sent her, but there was something at a good deal and I saw that it was on her wish list, so I jumped on it and sent it her way.
3528749	3530230	Speaking of which, you should open your present.
3530410	3531390	I should open my present.
3532010	3534691	A live unboxing, a live un-presenting.
3535171	3536332	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3557852	3559715	and it actually has graphics now.
3559795	3560656	Wait, Doom RL?
3560716	3561176	Doom RL.
3561336	3561897	I've not heard of this.
3561917	3562438	Doom roguelike.
3562578	3564880	It's surprisingly fun.
3565021	3572008	I'm a little sad that the levels are, they're very roguelike instead of being very doom-like.
3572709	3576714	And I mean that in like classic rogue and, oh Jesus, NetHack.
3577554	3578235	All that kind of stuff.
3578255	3579776	Very classic, very boxy.
3580097	3583700	And yeah, it scales down the Doom textures and plays it again.
3583840	3585181	But I don't know.
3585221	3593227	Maybe I'll look in and see if I can make levels myself because it'd be pretty cool to actually put homaged, if not straight up ported, Doom worlds into Doom RL.
3594208	3598091	But obviously, considering that I just gave it number one, a lot more Rogue Legacy as well.
3598211	3599673	I think I got another...
3600673	3601954	30 levels or some odd like that.
3602034	3604096	Levels basically map to how many upgrades you got.
3604336	3607058	So a good heaping helping of hours in the last week.
3608398	3612541	After I watched you streaming Super Hexagon, I tried that out for myself again.
3613442	3614743	And it's strange.
3614823	3617224	I bought it on iOS some time ago.
3617565	3619686	And I'm not terrible at it on iOS.
3620447	3621427	But on a D-pad, I...
3622848	3623949	Just abysmal.
3624409	3629193	My records are barely 20-30 seconds on any level and much less on the higher ones.
3629213	3630694	No, those are really good scores.
3631775	3632576	They really are.
3632896	3636960	But I can beat 30 seconds relatively easy on iOS.
3637060	3641663	And I think it's because for what it's worth, the D-pads on Apple laptops are very small.
3642464	3652072	And so to play them with these micro touches doesn't work very well where on iOS I just have to jam my finger onto one of the sides of the iPhone or iPad or what have you.
3653593	3655994	But, yeah, fun reminder.
3656674	3658996	Like I said, I played that game on iOS some time ago and it was really fun.
3659136	3664719	But Super Hexagon, Rogue Legacy, Doom RL, probably something else that I don't even recall at the moment.
3665099	3666640	I feel like I talked about it last week.
3666740	3670222	But definitely the continuing Rogue week.
3670602	3671162	Rogue-like week.
3672403	3674584	That is a great week to have as far as I'm concerned.
3674784	3675425	It absolutely is.
3675445	3676345	I love me some roguelikes.
3676425	3676685	All right.
3677906	3679087	Real quick, I forgot.
3679707	3680608	I went to Golf Land.
3681889	3682209	Oh no.
3708507	3710429	It's like, why did they even add that?
3710469	3712710	It was completely annoying the entire time.
3714411	3716393	And yeah, it's, it's, Golf Land's sad.
3718194	3727721	I think a lot of the arcades we used to love are just, it's so hard to go into them and see just a sea of little kid gambling games, the ticket spitting games.
3727781	3728962	It's just so hard to see that.
3729603	3731024	Don't get Josh addicted to those.
3731504	3732385	Yeah.
3733536	3733796	Nah.
3734417	3734758	Alright.
3735879	3736320	Moving on.
3736440	3739164	I think we are going to get into some news, but first, some quick housekeeping.
3739905	3744130	Twitter.com slash OLR or you can also follow us on Facebook.
3744170	3745673	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3745953	3746974	We're also on Google+.
3747094	3749498	Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
3750198	3757841	We do tape live again Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at vognetwork.com and we will be back.
3757961	3763743	I mean we didn't end up having any time off for the holidays just because these Sundays fell on pretty good days this year.
3764463	3771906	So we will be back again next week still looking at the potential of doing a road show in a couple weeks which will be very exciting because we haven't done one of those in a very long time.
3771946	3772726	And I should be able to.
3773186	3774648	So this is going to be very exciting.
3774728	3786199	But unfortunately, Loki, it'll probably be right when the kid's here, but it'll work out for at least us to go hopefully hang with some of the old school friends at OLR and some of our friends in the Bay Area.
3786219	3787380	So it'll be a very different type of episode.
3787400	3787760	It'll be fun.
3788721	3789541	Oh, all right.
3790262	3792203	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.
3792223	3792683	Wait, wait, wait.
3792703	3793303	Jason opened his present.
3793323	3794323	I just unwrapped my present.
3794343	3794844	Oh, what'd you get?
3795664	3797605	A lot of foil, which I am now wearing as a hat.
3798105	3798385	Why?
3798465	3799085	Because I can.
3799346	3800346	It's very pretty.
3800406	3802287	It's very blue, flowery, something.
3802487	3803167	I want to feel cool.
3803707	3807309	I actually want to go get some more to do decoupage with it just because it's so pretty.
3808583	3809684	ThinkGeekShirt
3828393	3829674	Make me a hat with this foil.
3829974	3830274	Okay.
3831394	3831614	All right.
3831635	3835136	Anyhow, get that foil off my head because I can't see the news otherwise.
3835196	3836217	So let's get to the news.
3837237	3838157	Loki, start us off tonight.
3838978	3839358	All right.
3839458	3844240	So usually when we report these types of stories, it's normally EA shutting down servers.
3844300	3846041	But this time around, it's actually going to be Sony.
3846321	3851223	They're going to be shutting down their online servers for a few of the PlayStation 3 games that they have.
3852204	3856126	Starting off with, of course, Gran Turismo 5 is going to be –
3857239	3866322	having their servers turned off May 20th next year, and Resistance, the entire franchise, going down on March 28th.
3866803	3879968	Also, as of January 28th, they're going to be shutting down the online connectivity for MAG, SOCOM Special Forces, and SOCOM Confrontation, and SOCOM Confrontation and MAG.
3880308	3883609	Those are online-only games, so if you bought those, you're fucked.
3884420	3886662	Your game is over.
3887543	3898894	I kind of get the Gran Turismo 5 because they're trying to nudge people onto Gran Turismo 6, and I'm sure there's newer SOCOM games as well, but MAG, I kind of thought there was an audience still out there for that.
3898934	3905280	I could be wrong, but I kind of thought MAG still had a little loyal following to it because it was really about massive groups of people, right?
3905360	3905520	Right.
3905760	3907301	I guess if they're not achieving that anymore.
3907981	3925132	I certainly don't have these numbers to back them up either, and I know I was interested in the game, never actually went into picking it up, but a game like that, if its numbers are dwindling, if they're not able to matchmake and keep the 4A, the massive number melee going on, then why keep supporting the game?
3925172	3927413	Why keep putting the time and money into it?
3928834	3933657	I always think that you should have an offline component to at least do some sort of LAN or something, so
3934410	3937091	You have something that's not just a coaster when this is done.
3937311	3937631	Right.
3938871	3939212	Let's see.
3939352	3945013	I'm looking here in chat and Robert M says, I thought MAG had already shut down.
3945473	3947974	Well, no, they're shutting it down January 28th, 2014.
3948754	3955216	It's just that this was actually announced some time ago in July of 2013 that they were going to shut it down.
3955256	3960258	So the news that it is shutting down is not necessarily new, but it is coming within the next few weeks.
3960618	3960798	Yeah.
3962697	3965599	Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft Final Fantasy XIV, World of Warcraft
3981733	4006117	but they'll shut down someday 11 is still active isn't it oh yeah there's no no time no expectation for that to go away no game like that'll be around forever you know at least like something like that that's a pc game there's a chance that someone may be able to like you know run a a third party server or something like that after the game is shut down whereas something like this that's on playstation 3 there's no chance for that at all you're just
4006670	4007411	You're out of luck.
4007511	4013956	I mean, and yeah, maybe you're not playing the game, but I still think that there should always be at least some sort of an offline component.
4014416	4016778	I agree with that aspect of it.
4016838	4022823	If not an offline component, then a self-hosted game, a self-hosted server that you can run for nostalgia's sake.
4022903	4023424	Yeah.
4024264	4026726	They did that when they shut down Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.
4027387	4027787	I wouldn't know.
4028187	4028528	They did.
4028908	4036294	They made it so that you could export your stuff and play on private servers, which is weird to see a company embrace that, but that was a really good thing, I think.
4036394	4037135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4058274	4067857	For nostalgia's sake, being able to continue to play the game, revisiting old gaming memories, that would be a good thing for MMO makers to adopt and continue to do.
4069998	4083362	And considering, too, that eventually, I'm assuming, I don't know if they're going to carry on the SOCOM brand, so like PlayStation 4, but you might want to have some of that stuff still available to play so that, you know,
4084656	4088319	People might know what SOCOM is when the PlayStation 4 version comes around.
4089460	4092702	Unless it is truly a franchise that they're going to sunset.
4092802	4093563	I mean, we don't know.
4095004	4095744	That could be happening.
4096945	4097286	Alright.
4104795	4108176	Well, we shall move on with some more news.
4108496	4108737	Jason.
4122742	4140072	Which, not to jump on a presumption of Nintendo, but considering the age of their player base, having a productive game... Like, everybody is astonished when they find out that somebody building something in Minecraft is absurdly young.
4140372	4144475	You know, they're 7, they're 8, maybe even younger than that.
4145115	4150919	And the Wii gamepad gives you at least a little bit more flexibility than a standard controller would.
4153200	4158262	I know a lot of people that just stick their kids in front of a laptop or a desktop and let them go to work.
4158642	4168287	But for something like this that's a little bit more accessible, this comes as a huge surprise to me because kids that I know really seem to enjoy Minecraft.
4168347	4169107	And so to get...
4170968	4173569	DarkSakura did just give out some foil, so we have that part up
4195061	4197002	It's not tinfoil, it's fake foil.
4197102	4200723	But it at least gets us halfway to these conspiracy theories.
4201443	4205764	No, but for real, like, you know, a map, duh, would be great on the Wii U gamepad.
4206304	4211546	I think just having your inventory screen and the crafting on the gamepad would make for a great experience.
4211826	4215347	That's part of the biggest pain in the ass of Minecraft is having to bring up the screen.
4215467	4216367	Oh, where was I, man?
4216447	4220568	You know, I think, oh my gosh, it would make so much sense on the Wii U. So it is very disappointing.
4220959	4221319	and DarkSakura.
4241051	4241652	Yeah, who knows?
4241712	4242452	That's possible too.
4243293	4247217	Don't underestimate, though, guys, how huge Minecraft is with, like, kids.
4247777	4248658	I'm always shocked.
4248678	4249219	Julian plays.
4249859	4253943	I'm always shocked at how many people I know with kids, and they're like, oh yeah, my kid plays Minecraft.
4253963	4256025	And it probably needs not be said.
4256205	4257126	Not only just the kids.
4257446	4258606	The whole freaking family!
4258746	4259867	Yeah, yeah, yeah, for real.
4259887	4263448	But I'm just saying, like, there are a ton of people that play Minecraft.
4263708	4267430	Like, it is pretty astounding what that game's accomplished.
4267450	4282215	There's a buddy of mine that runs a private server and has, you know, Bucket and all the mods, and there's an IRC room that we congregate in, and so he runs a plugin that bridges the conversation in Minecraft back to IRC two-way.
4283075	4285616	And this wouldn't exist on a console, of course.
4286276	4313397	um but the the expansiveness is what makes that game and the game is built around expansion or surviving if you're if you play survival of course or building stuff expansion like me yeah or digging holes i get rid of stuff too there is an immense amount of potential now and i think last week we talked about like the long tail of nintendo there will not be an immediate return on investment but it will happen because that game is popular that is
4314057	4341392	you know that that would that would be a huge title to make its way to Nintendo but current plans unfortunately ain't gonna happen for the foreseeable future you know I had to really resist picking up the PlayStation 3 version but it's like dude you own it on the 360 and you own it on the PC and how much did you really play it on the PC but I've had this real bug to play Minecraft lately so Loki we need to get that VOG server back even if even if I've got to front the money for it I think that we got to make it happen so we can do it you don't need to front the money for it I just haven't gotten around I'll I'll do it I'll
4342452	4343073	Yay!
4343153	4344153	Alright, I'm excited.
4344553	4346154	Christmas miracles happen again.
4346334	4356839	Even if you bomb the server and start new and maybe as an easy mode monsters thing where there's some challenge or something against it, I think that would be great.
4358240	4365644	I backed up the server because they brought back the server for a few days and I was able to back it all up.
4365744	4369106	It's old now compared to the updates and everything.
4369446	4369706	Also,
4370516	4375079	Free Mode gets boring after a while because there's no real point, especially when there's not a lot of people playing at the same time.
4375099	4376639	That's why survival is kind of nice.
4376700	4377220	Yeah, yeah.
4377360	4382042	See, my favorite thing was doing all the creative stuff was digging holes and exploring.
4382122	4383783	So I didn't really care about the other stuff.
4384844	4385184	All right.
4385344	4387806	And we got some people in chat wanting to know when that's back up.
4387886	4388706	So look forward to that.
4388746	4389527	Maybe that'll be something for 2014.
4390747	4392449	Uh, but I do notice Robert M in chat says,
4406365	4419072	Honestly, though, I'm going to tell you what stopped me from getting it on the PlayStation 3 is that we haven't heard what's happening with PlayStation 4 and Vita versions yet, and I want to wait and hear that, because will my PlayStation 3... Is it going to be cross-play amongst all of them?
4419112	4422354	Because if so, fine, I'll invest the money in the PlayStation 3 version right now.
4422794	4427637	But if it's not going to be cross-play and the PlayStation 4 is going to be different or whatever, then I'll probably just wait and get it on 4.
4428558	4430699	It's going to be different on 4, I guarantee it, because
4431104	4435808	That's why right now the PlayStation 3 version is basically a port of the Xbox 360 one.
4435928	4440251	So 4 and Xbox One are going to have larger maps and probably more features.
4441332	4441912	Alright, fair enough.
4442232	4442813	Well, let's move on.
4442853	4444194	DarkSakura, what do you have for us in the news?
4445038	4445818	Mass Effect stuff.
4448121	4462835	Well, as you guys know, on November 7th, which was N7 day, we had a few tweets go in that showed some of the screens, not like full-on screenshots, but you could see computers in the background with a little bit here and there for the development of
4463195	4463696	BioWare BioWare
4480491	4509388	and they're basically saying and the tweet basically says great time playing the next Mass Effect game in Montreal ambitious beautiful fresh but recognizable and fun so and I'm from what this is it looks like it's just in the very early stages of level testing and design what a fucking tease though I know I'm so excited and scared literally I am Jesse Spano I am Jesse Spano in that scene when it was the new Mass Effect game I'm so excited and so scared
4510149	4511532	It's not going to be a Shepard story.
4511572	4513797	I'm a little scared, but I'm really excited to play.
4514779	4515580	Think about it.
4515781	4518587	We will get that trailer at E3.
4519028	4520010	By six months from now...
4520635	4522316	We will know about this game, DarkSakura.
4522396	4523057	Oh, yes, we will.
4523077	4523757	I know.
4524238	4529602	And it might make it for the holidays, although I kind of think spring 2015 is a little more realistic, but you never know.
4530002	4530683	If they can play it now.
4530703	4531523	I'm still going to play it.
4531643	4532224	I don't care.
4532384	4539669	I mean, I was very irritated with how more human-centric the last game went.
4540590	4547656	I would like to see more expansion into the other species in the Mass Effect universe, but I'll wait and see what happens.
4547696	4552700	I'm going to reserve my judgment until I've actually got it in front of me playing it.
4553440	4553981	That's how I feel.
4557213	4559093	That and it better have the same good multiplayer.
4559513	4559854	All right.
4559874	4561514	Because that was pretty freaking awesome.
4561534	4562094	Yeah, you know what's funny?
4562114	4569715	We were talking about server shutdowns earlier in the show, and I'm kind of surprised they haven't threatened to pull the plug on Mass Effect 3 yet, but I'm sure there's still a lot of people that play online.
4570156	4570716	Oh, heck yeah.
4570856	4575377	So, but I don't know about, like, Wii U, but who knows?
4575697	4575977	All right.
4576237	4581438	It was so borked on Wii U just with the whole Genesis thing, and you didn't get all of your options.
4581878	4582258	Yeah.
4583299	4589165	Honestly, if you're going to get it on any system, get it on the Xbox because you can totally mod your files.
4590266	4591087	If you have to get a console.
4591507	4592348	If you have to get a console.
4593109	4595871	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4595972	4600836	Although I have a feeling there's not going to be much, but it's a part of the show we always do.
4600997	4604500	So, Loki, how's the US look for release dates?
4604921	4605241	Nothing.
4606894	4608635	Not a damn thing coming out this week.
4608975	4612196	You know, let's travel to Japan and take a look and see if anything's coming out there.
4612316	4613536	I kind of don't think so.
4614496	4616697	I was a little slow in bringing it up here, so sorry, guys.
4616857	4619257	They still do not have PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, remember.
4619297	4620058	That is coming out later.
4621138	4629680	Okay, Mafia 2 gets a price reduction, and there's some third-party game pads on the PlayStation 3 on December 31st.
4629740	4631001	That's something, right?
4631041	4631781	How about on the Xbox 360?
4633261	4634422	Nothing on the Xbox 360.
4634822	4635822	What about on the handhelds?
4635842	4637343	How about on the Vita or the 3DS?
4638223	4638884	Nothing on the Vita.
4641945	4646227	3DS gets Puzzle & Dragons Z. Oh, never mind.
4646287	4650369	Those are just decorative things.
4650389	4652590	Is Puzzle & Dragons really big on 3DS over there?
4652770	4653310	That's kind of weird.
4655592	4655912	DarkSakura
4677538	4678359	Jack and shit.
4678579	4679800	I figured for the UK.
4680040	4680300	Yep.
4680360	4680640	Nothing.
4681301	4681661	All right.
4681741	4682322	I'm sorry.
4682522	4682762	Sorry.
4682982	4683442	Fuck all.
4684223	4685124	Fuck all's coming out.
4685804	4688686	You've got enough games to play right now is the moral of this story.
4688766	4689307	Steam.
4689947	4690587	Release dates.
4690848	4691989	Apps are freaking literally nothing.
4692049	4692369	All right.
4692489	4695011	Couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
4695091	4695391	Loki.
4696772	4697292	All right.
4697813	4703637	So unfortunately, one of the games I was actually looking forward to next year
4704965	4733068	No Man's Sky The developer, Hello Games, suffered some flood damage over the week and it took out some of their servers and PCs and stuff like that monitors, furniture a bunch of other stuff I'm not sure if that necessarily obviously that might affect some of the development of the game but they haven't really said that anything's been delayed yet I'm sure they have all that stuff backed up anyways
4733667	4762534	and then also they're saying they're not really insured for the flood damage but hopefully they may get some sort of help from Microsoft I guess they're saying Phil Spencer said he might be able to look into helping them out but I don't know they'll see maybe they'll do some funding stuff to recover some of the things that they had that need to be replaced or it kind of sucks that they didn't have flood insurance I'm not really sure in the area that they're at if it's
4762987	4765349	Prone to flooding or if this is just some freak thing.
4765689	4766950	That sucks either way.
4767471	4775397	I mean, it's really unfortunate, but these Mother Nature events, or as they call them, acts of God or whatever, these things are going to happen.
4775477	4788667	So just a solemn reminder to have an emergency plan no matter who you are, what you do, what are you going to do if there's a fire or there's an earthquake or a tornado or whatever it is where you live.
4789167	4790909	All right, let's put your offices on the second floor.
4791469	4792730	Yeah, right, right.
4793330	4794190	So, yeah.
4794890	4796271	Well, good luck to them, though.
4796571	4807514	I hope they're able to make a recovery because that No Man's Sky did look very interesting, even though for some reason it's the one game they didn't show on TV, which was kind of shitty, but it was a good trailer.
4808355	4808515	Yeah.
4808795	4809095	All right.
4810118	4812079	Ragingator says that games are like Pokemans.
4812099	4812900	You gotta get them all.
4813160	4813620	No, you don't.
4814501	4815801	You can't get them all.
4815861	4816482	You can't.
4816962	4821845	No, no, no, but you really don't need to because there are games that stink on ice.
4822557	4824398	All the networks online were getting hammered.
4843504	4845866	PlayStation Network shut down for an amount of time.
4846247	4847328	Xbox Live was down.
4847368	4850230	I don't think it was down quite as long as the others, but it was down for a little bit.
4850310	4852092	And Nintendo got hammered as well.
4852612	4866385	And Nintendo, you know, very apologetic via their Facebook page saying the problem, the reason why Nintendo Network went down is because the influx of Nintendo Network accounts being created and trying to get onto the eShop platform.
4866585	4876412	Well, okay, when you sell a 3DS with an eShop copy of a game that a lot of people want to play, I mean... Translation, because of y'all greedy bitches.
4876973	4887220	I don't even think it's necessarily that they're greedy, but it's just here we go again with poor planning, especially when it comes to network stuff, and it's a bad trend for games.
4887241	4891504	Speaking of some of the worst games of the year, calling out SimCity.
4892144	4895747	Now, I personally am not calling it out because I'm going to be honest, I didn't play it.
4896087	4896768	Thank you for watching!
4912882	4928566	Now, maybe a little bit apples to oranges is what I'm saying there, because obviously a 3DS does not require you to be online, but Nintendo certainly took strides with their latest patch, and by only bundling in the eShop version of some of these games on some of their consoles, you know, they were kind of asking for it on Christmas Day.
4928666	4934168	So, you kind of look at something like this and you go, Nintendo, y'all got no one to blame but yourselves.
4935048	4936289	You know, and your poor planning.
4936869	4941270	And also, I'm curious to actually how many consoles they sold, because you know, it...
4942332	4950362	They didn't sell that many and they couldn't handle the influx of a couple thousand people, then I'd be a little curious.
4950462	4952025	Yeah, but it's not just the Wii U, Loki.
4952065	4953026	It's the 3DS.
4953787	4956791	I understand that, but come on.
4957331	4958833	They know how many consoles they're putting out.
4958853	4959354	Ugh.
4960137	4967259	Well, anyhow, the Nintendo eShop on Nintendo 3DS was taken down, and last we heard it was supposed to be back up 4 a.m.
4967359	4967759	today.
4967959	4969820	I haven't checked to see if it was back up.
4970220	4971000	I think it is.
4971060	4974861	I've seen Miiverse has been pretty active and so forth, so I think things are running again over there.
4975561	4978602	But yeah, that was not so great.
4979682	4985284	Also, kind of as a snowball effect, the Pokemon Bank was supposed to come out on December 27th.
4986704	4994206	It was out and then it got pulled with no Western launch yet announced because this was supposed to come out here as well.
4994746	5000068	And the Pokemon Bank was the new system where you were going to be able to take Pokemon from X and Y and put them in the cloud.
5000448	5003869	This is how you were going to be able to transfer Pokemon to future games.
5004409	5009811	And no matter what system Nintendo has Pokemon out on next, you'd be able to transfer things through the cloud.
5010271	5015315	So because of the network difficulties, they pulled the game because they wanted people to stop trying to get the game.
5015635	5016856	It's causing too much bandwidth.
5017316	5021920	Again, you should have known when you put all this shit out at once, something like this would happen.
5022040	5023081	So shame, shame.
5023541	5026403	But for better or worse, they did delay this a little bit.
5026783	5027804	Your Pokemon in the cloud?
5028505	5029345	Nintendo used Fly.
5029605	5030366	It wasn't very effective.
5032336	5034017	Womp womp.
5034898	5035238	Fired!
5035698	5048365	Alright, anyhow, if you want to try Pokemon Bank, you're supposed to be able to download until January 31st, 2014 and be able to download a 30-day trial and then it will be $5 a year.
5049346	5053888	And if you access the bank before September 30th of 2014, you'll get Celebi for free.
5054649	5058651	So there you go, 3,000 Pokemon can go in the bank and it will... Did you say celibacy?
5059111	5059772	No, Celebi.
5060632	5071521	It will work with Pokemon Black, White, Black 2, White 2 through the PokeTransporter and X and Y. So that's how you can get those generations in there as well and then whatever happens next.
5072722	5073242	There you go.
5073282	5078426	But unfortunately, we don't know when that will come out, but I'm assuming probably in the first week of January is when they're going to push that back.
5078466	5081809	And it will probably have a very quiet launch because they don't want everybody to hit it at once.
5082669	5085772	But once it hits the internet, open the floodgates!
5087810	5090592	FifthDream in chat saying, the Pokemons are clogging up our clouds.
5090673	5092174	Yeah, that is kind of what happened.
5093515	5097759	It's like in WALL-E when the ship was trying to escape and it just blew through all of the satellites.
5099320	5099740	Right?
5101722	5106526	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane where, you know what, you didn't have games in the cloud.
5108385	5110426	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5110506	5112407	I actually picked something a little on the obscure side.
5112447	5113407	I picked Ordine.
5134818	5135498	Ordyne it is!
5157670	5185448	and you have characters named Yuichiro Tomari who is a scientist and the main protagonist and you get a red ship and then you get Sunday Chin who is a Chinese assistant and the pilot of the green ship you get Kana Aihara who is Tomari's fiance you get Dr. Kubota who is the main antagonist you get Miki-chan who is a shopkeeper and Dream Company Limited who is a robot who flies around and helps you
5185988	5188250	And basically, it's just a really cute little shooter.
5188290	5190191	You get all the usual power-ups, you know.
5192332	5195554	And the thing about this is that it came out in 1988.
5197516	5201218	So it's one of those Namco System 2 hardware games.
5201939	5204680	And it came out on PC Engine in 1989.
5205061	5207542	And it came out for the TurboGrafx in 1990.
5207662	5211045	It's in the Namco Museum Volume 4.
5211385	5213967	And it has come out on the North American Virtual Console.
5214967	5220233	So it's just a cute little game.
5220413	5224337	It was actually advertised as a comical shooter.
5225018	5227781	I gotta be honest, it looks a lot like Fantasy Zone.
5228041	5229563	A lot, a lot like Fantasy Zone.
5229583	5230183	Yeah, it does.
5230204	5232266	It has that same cartoony, cutesy style.
5232586	5234228	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
5234801	5237823	Now, the one thing about this, though, is that... It's like a little shop.
5237843	5239984	See, he just flew in the shop, like you do in fantasy mode.
5240144	5241285	Exactly, exactly.
5242386	5249430	With this particular one, you basically, like, for example, Miyuki's channel will stop by, like you were just saying.
5250390	5256614	When Dream Company passes by, you can win crystals to buy weapons.
5257695	5262638	But you have one-hit kills, but you can buy your extra lives as you go through the game.
5263158	5264599	It's just a cutesy little game.
5264639	5265700	I mean, it was fun.
5266141	5268022	Not a whole bunch extra special to it.
5268103	5271205	Oh, they do like a little celebration dance when they clear the round.
5271526	5277791	And I do believe that this is the one that Albatross was from in Namco High.
5278772	5285858	So whenever you guys see Albatross or Al-B-Tross, as he is also known in that, this is the game he's from.
5286679	5288280	I'm going to double check it just to make sure.
5288841	5290042	But I'm pretty sure that is it.
5291949	5292750	And that's your classic game.
5292950	5293250	What's this?
5293290	5295451	Some type of like roulette game that's in there too?
5295611	5296612	Like little gambling games?
5296972	5298673	Yeah, that's when you run into the robot.
5299114	5299434	Oh, okay.
5300694	5301055	Pretty cool.
5301075	5301375	All right.
5301755	5302356	Just double checking.
5302376	5308539	I have to admit, I had never played this game before, but I kind of want to, I wish it was on one of the newer retro game collections so I could check it out.
5308559	5308920	But there it is.
5309260	5314303	Your classic game of the week, boys and girls, Ordine, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5315444	5316244	Good pick, DarkSakura.
5316264	5317445	I like it when you pick things I haven't heard of.
5317907	5324133	And also just to say, you know, again, if you haven't played Namco High, it's really fucking fun.
5325133	5327456	And it'll work on your phone because it is HTML5.
5328136	5328496	All right.
5329697	5333221	I'm double checking on the students one more time just so I can be sure.
5334262	5335603	And it's not loading up.
5335703	5337064	So sorry.
5337504	5339226	I'll probably be able to tell you guys soon.
5340859	5341159	All right.
5341199	5345703	Well, maybe she can tell us after the break because it is that time to take a break here at Orange Launch Radio.
5345723	5348465	But we got plenty more show when we come back.
5349246	5349626	I was wrong.
5349666	5350707	Albatross is from Rolling Thunder.
5350727	5351568	I don't know what I was thinking.
5351908	5352148	All right.
5353189	5356392	Yes, there's not as much news tonight, so we're flying through that a little quickly.
5356452	5357993	But we do still have the mailbag.
5358353	5359995	We have the Fugle Question of the Week coming up.
5360035	5362397	We have your phone calls a little later in the show.

5444240	5453344	But we're giving away a $20 gift card to many popular gaming services such as Nintendo Network and Xbox Live and so forth.
5453824	5454344	Also YouTube.
5469631	5490952	Yes, Jason, you've been working very hard on this YouTube, so I gotta say, and thank you for reminding me, we just put up last week, we just put, because YouTube is, again, YouTube runs one week behind, six days-ish, one week behind, just because we prefer to have folks listen via the places that really give us ratings, instead of giving Google ratings, giving us ratings.
5491332	5495993	First, but then we like having it on YouTube for discovery purposes.
5496313	5502254	And starting with last week's episode, Jason, I don't know if you really plan on taking that level of effort every week, but I was very impressed.
5503255	5509936	You kind of made it more of like an archive where you actually bookmarked all the sections of the show and very easy to find a part of the show you're looking for.
5510676	5512677	Some video synced up and things.
5512997	5514977	Well, the video is always going to sync up.
5515037	5516818	Otherwise, I just completely screwed something up.
5516838	5517118	Yeah.
5518058	5519379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5539389	5540810	Tonight, we're trying something new.
5540850	5542031	You guys don't know what it is yet.
5542291	5543472	We'll surprise you a little later.
5543712	5545694	I'll tell you what it is, but we're doing something new tonight.
5546634	5549076	It's just how you always kind of think, like, how can I do that?
5549096	5550957	How can I take this one step?
5551998	5557342	Like I've said previously as well, I've also never done video work before, and it's always been an incredible interest to me.
5558103	5574459	and so this is this is one part learning design this is one part doing video editing this is one part being able to do a lot of post-production yeah I'm I'm contributing ways that are very fun for me and I plan to continue doing so and doing better each time
5574659	5575499	Yeah, do what you love.
5575519	5576340	That's why I do this.
5595525	5603807	was that it was recognized some of the stuff I do outside of work and that I work with audio and video and that type of production and things kind of outside of work.
5603907	5607148	And that all plays into now, you know, what I do in my day job.
5607228	5613230	So like, you know, all these years later, OLR is actually like help me get a job in a way.
5613250	5615990	It's so weird, but I'm so thankful for it.
5616071	5618131	And thank you guys for supporting it.
5618471	5618991	Absolutely.
5622182	5622983	I got a job too.
5623203	5623803	That's right.
5623864	5624744	You got a job as well.
5624764	5625985	I'm not going to say where I'm working.
5626086	5626306	Yes.
5626746	5628227	Unless you actually know me in person.
5629188	5633672	Just because given the nature of the job, I don't really want to.
5633772	5635074	Completely understand.
5635874	5637476	But I will be doing some tech support.
5638396	5639057	and that will be fun.
5641978	5646260	And this is the thing that floored me is that I just happened to put it on my Facebook like I normally do.
5646360	5647381	I'm so happy I got the job.
5648621	5649162	120 people.
5650202	5651743	I was like, how do I know that many people?
5652423	5657646	So I want to thank everyone who supported me in my attempts to find gainful employment.
5658767	5680190	um thank you people who were just being happy for me because you know that means a lot to me too you know just a lot of uh selfless people I want to thank so thank you and um also listening to uh the break music makes me really want to watch Swing Girls again because
5680410	5683291	Mexican Flyer is one of the songs they do for the finale.
5683451	5687932	We played some Space Channel 5 music here live, which I can't repeat on the podcast.
5688272	5690073	We would especially not own that on YouTube.
5690113	5692233	We'd get a copyright shutdown thing.
5692253	5694554	Actually, I don't know if Mexican Flyer is back in the public domain.
5694574	5697615	The Sega version definitely isn't.
5697635	5704097	Well, no, but it is big band swing music, which really brought that genre into the fore.
5706360	5708283	Actdeft says that we're happy because you're happy.
5708463	5709124	Thank you.
5709184	5715714	I've got to give an arm of support to our buddy Brad over at PodCulture because he's job hunting right now and he's looking for something.
5715734	5719820	It took me three years so I hope it doesn't take you that long.
5720943	5724146	We are keeping our fingers and toesies crossed for our friend Brad.
5725247	5733935	If you need a really smart guy who produces a solid podcast about sci-fi and geek culture and a little bit of games and a little bit of everything, hire Brad.
5734595	5735076	Absolutely.
5735302	5739205	I downloaded it, I haven't watched it yet, but someone spoiled the regeneration for me.
5757148	5757629	David Tennant
5775552	5776112	I have that box set.
5776272	5777673	I need to get that back for my friend.
5799898	5826939	I don't watch hardly any TV when I finished Orange is the New Black that was a miracle that I actually had the attention span to watch 13 hours worth of TV at any rate since I mentioned it if nobody out there has seen Swing Girls you can find it it's inexpensive now great little movie and yes it has subtitles but I just have to say if you like the music in Space Channel 5 get into Big Band there you go Loki you still there with us?
5828800	5829801	Nope, he took a break.
5829841	5830581	Oh no, he's there, hey!
5832263	5840649	It's so weird when I can't see you, but Loki Baby Watch is on, which is why Loki is on Skype with us for a few weeks here, but Loki, any plans for the new year?
5840669	5844652	Um, no, not really.
5844672	5852158	Well, since Josh dressed up like a firework for Halloween, is he excited about New Year's Eve, or do you guys try not to get him too worked up about that?
5853711	5855093	He doesn't stay up for any of that stuff.
5855394	5856215	He doesn't know what's going on.
5856256	5859702	He has trouble figuring out what day it is during the day.
5862728	5865694	He thinks when he goes down for a nap or something like that, that's another day.
5866112	5874076	and so he doesn't understand time right now.
5874136	5875677	You and the jokes need to stop.
5876697	5877798	I never will.
5878678	5879219	I know, I know.
5880119	5883060	You want the intern Drew position here.
5883781	5886382	Anyway, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.
5887523	5894246	Alright, so next month they've got some pretty decent stuff on PlayStation Plus and I'm
5894930	5896291	I'm kind of excited about this.
5896631	5900912	In case you haven't played it yet, Bioshock Infinite is going to be one of the titles I've given away free.
5901372	5915758	Devil May Cry, also Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, and they're going to have some stuff for the Vita as well, Smartass and Worms Battle Islands, and Don't Starve will be available for PlayStation 4.
5916798	5918959	So, not bad.
5918999	5924101	I'm really curious to see Microsoft step it up for the Xbox, you know,
5924892	5925913	Thanks for watching!
5951885	5972604	is fantastic there was the suggestions going around that even if you don't have a PS4 yet if you pick up well there's no free plus titles for 4 not retail but if you are a plus subscriber even if you don't have this system you can still buy it online and re-download it in the future which is
5973365	5975346	Pretty damn fantastic.
5975706	5981329	And I've been doing that even though I've been away from my PlayStation 3 for two, three months.
5984150	5984370	Yeah.
5984830	5990312	So I'm looking forward to it and definitely recommend anyone that hasn't played Bioshock Infinite, definitely give it a try.
5990393	5993594	If you have PlayStation Plus, it's worth it.
5995415	5997616	And then the first round of...
5998826	6027795	Grand Theft Auto online jobs these are created with the new deathmatch and race online creation tools that they released I think literally a week or so ago and so these are now Rockstar verified jobs they have basically picked six races and four deathmatches that now be kind of appearing everywhere online like the official Rockstar matches and so that's kind of cool and they actually do have a system in there
6028343	6032347	I know it didn't bleed through, but tell me if I'm crazy, you two here in studio just heard that siren, didn't you?
6051929	6053050	The siren?
6053751	6058076	There was an emergency siren that just went hauling in three... Oh, in this neighborhood?
6058116	6058657	I don't doubt it.
6059538	6060339	It was just well-timed.
6062261	6064564	A Grand Theft Auto story and the police are here?
6064704	6065004	Exactly.
6066241	6066781	Absolutely.
6067402	6067662	Works.
6068343	6068643	Alright.
6069323	6071045	Well, I got a couple stories for you guys.
6071325	6072486	Another story about Doom.
6072546	6073226	What's up with this?
6073326	6076248	It's like we're at Blast from the Past tonight with all this Doom story.
6076609	6079931	But VXJasonXV, tell me if you've heard about this one.
6080672	6089538	There's a mod for Doom that puts Resident Evil 4's Mercenaries mode within Doom.
6089938	6090399	That's cool.
6090919	6094081	So there's actually a little video of this here that I'll play.
6094501	6095061	Sorry, Jason.
6096462	6098603	It's very loud.
6098943	6103705	But you see them going through the menu here, and it's got the Resident Evil 4 stuff in there.
6103725	6104986	Leon S. Kennedy.
6105326	6107567	It looks like you can play as different characters there, and Leon's one of them.
6111723	6119128	and for the chatters and podcast listeners, you can go to youtube.com slash orange lounge radio and view the video that we were watching just now.
6119148	6121670	Not the best radio, but the video will exist in a week.
6122030	6128814	Just so you know, so you can have this, you do need a copy of Doom and you have to have its multiplayer mods in order to run this mod.
6128854	6130555	It's only about 85% complete now.
6130575	6132657	Okay, now we're finally getting into some gameplay there.
6132717	6135979	So, oh, that's a very recognizable Doom.
6136059	6139101	It's almost like they took Doom and made it like over the shoulder.
6140261	6140401	Oh!
6140721	6141782	Oh, he did the neck breaker!
6142082	6143863	Very, very Resident Evil 4 style.
6144203	6145023	Oh, yeah!
6145304	6148405	With all the little, like, pop-ups that come up at the bottom there.
6149305	6150066	That's pretty cool.
6150726	6151226	I like that.
6152227	6156769	So, yeah, he needs the multiplayer mods, and that's very awesome.
6157829	6158710	Where can you check that out?
6158770	6159450	I need to...
6160996	6161836	It's linked in this article.
6162016	6164417	Yeah.
6164837	6167778	That's almost as cool as... VigLink.com.
6167838	6168819	It's like buried.
6168999	6171560	That is almost as cool as ASCII Quake.
6171780	6175761	It actually just goes to Mediafire, so it's literally just like a no-name dump right now.
6175801	6177242	Yeah, somebody's hosting site there.
6177262	6181303	Well, just Google Domero, D-O-O-M, Doom Arrow.
6182003	6185025	D-O-O-M-E-R-O, and you can find his Ember Series mod.
6185185	6185985	That one's pretty cool.
6186065	6189086	Although, my favorite Doom mod to this day is still Gatchaman Doom.
6190720	6190980	All right.
6191781	6192642	So yeah, check that out.
6193663	6193964	All right.
6194805	6196346	Also, a quick story here.
6196727	6198128	Final Fantasy X-3.
6198368	6199329	What?
6199670	6200070	That's right.
6200170	6202953	X, not X, not X-2, but X-3.
6203414	6203834	Hold on.
6203934	6204415	Sit down.
6204795	6205556	Put your pants on.
6205836	6206817	It's not confirmed.
6207458	6208299	It's just that...
6209560	6212543	Kazushige Nojima Kazushige Nojima Kazushige Nojima
6231919	6236002	I would personally like to see a sequel like X3.
6237023	6243468	So, I mean, we're gonna get a XIII with Lightning Returns, so it's... They just need to shut up and give us another VII or something.
6243488	6245050	I was gonna say the same thing.
6245090	6247131	Where's my damn VII?
6247732	6251355	Or a full immersive remake of VI.
6252406	6257696	Alright, well, if you want to show your support, March 18th is the big day when these games come out in North America.
6257777	6261344	If you're in Europe, you've got to wait just a couple more days, March 21st.
6261544	6262346	So, check those out.
6263548	6264510	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6265842	6267783	Oh, I was just saying that my villager wants to kill Ed.
6267863	6269724	We had a message in chat from... Who doesn't?
6272045	6277367	They're talking about modding all the Doom stuff and then Tech2030 says, seriously, Animal Crossing mod where the villager shoots everything?
6277867	6281649	And I said, my villager wants to kill Ed because he won't leave my damn village.
6281749	6282289	I hate Ed.
6282449	6284310	And you've consistently hit him with bug nets.
6284790	6285810	Now I'm just ignoring him.
6286391	6289232	And I had him almost fully ignored and then accidentally talked to him.
6289352	6290772	Have you been writing him hateful notes?
6290853	6291353	You can't.
6291853	6293694	If you want him to leave, you have to ignore him.
6294054	6294134	Ugh.
6295171	6298573	And I'm like, I just want to murder him with my shovel.
6299513	6302075	Or embed the axe in his stupid horse head.
6302775	6303916	And then bury him with the shovel.
6304416	6305917	And see if he grows into an ed tree.
6306677	6307698	No, no.
6308598	6310780	He's not even worth being fertilizer, okay?
6311764	6312204	Or glue.
6312544	6313104	Or glue.
6313525	6314385	Or even food.
6314705	6315145	Or Jell-O.
6315885	6316906	This is going to a dark place.
6316946	6317306	Let's move on.
6317326	6318506	Super Punch-Out!
6318706	6319607	Ha ha ha!
6320207	6321047	Uppercut, uppercut.
6322728	6329010	Super Punch-Out is on Nintendo eShop for Wii U. And you can get it.
6330450	6332791	It came out in 1994 originally.
6333331	6336793	And it came out on Virtual Console for the Wii in 2009.
6337393	6340314	And now it's going to be on...
6340954	6342195	Wii Virtual Console for $8.
6344276	6345236	I'd buy that for a dollar.
6345416	6345797	Not really.
6346597	6349398	Well, if you bought it on Wii, then it will cost you just a dollar.
6349418	6350579	I think $1.50 gets Super Nintendo.
6352322	6361067	Also now for the PS3 people, there are two games coming out in Japan for PS3.
6361107	6363729	That is going to be Raiden 4.
6363969	6365330	Oh my god, I'm so happy.
6365390	6376456	I have to import that shit because I love... Dan and I were just listening to comparisons of the first Raiden game on different consoles, trying to listen to the music and stuff.
6376796	6378237	Found some were really awful.
6379158	6380860	Did you know the Lynx version doesn't have any music?
6381841	6382641	And it's really terrible.
6383582	6386905	And the other game coming out is Caladrius.
6387846	6393931	So, yeah, Raiden 4 is going to be Raiden Overkill, and then Caladrius is going to be out in 2014 as well.
6397615	6403260	All righty, let's take a trip to our Fugle Question of the Week.
6410731	6415255	You take Facebook and you take Google Plus and you slam them together and you get Boogle.
6415676	6422142	So we're going to go over to our Facebook and Google Plus communities where we're going to see some answers to our question, which is very simple this week.
6422182	6426146	I mean, it's a holiday show for the new year, the last show of the year.
6426586	6429969	So what is one very popular thing people like to do this time of year?
6430450	6433693	New Year's resolutions, which, you know, for better or worse, people do them.
6434093	6436655	I'm going to be using DVR as my interval training.
6455367	6457388	So that's kind of your resolution in a way.
6457709	6466334	Yeah, I mean, I hate to use my whole exercise thing as a resolution, but I want to use DDR and other physical games as part of my training regimen.
6466595	6467355	All right, fair enough.
6468216	6470057	So let's see what some of our listeners said.
6470637	6475380	Let's go over to Google+, where Actdeft said, Get a better gaming PC.
6475801	6479803	Also, getting an HDTV is one of my top gaming priorities.
6480204	6484687	But of course, like every year, my top resolution is finishing my massive backlog of games.
6486107	6489429	Redertainment says, must accomplish project buy a house.
6490110	6493292	Now, I'm assuming that's not an Animal Crossing reference, but it very well could be.
6493452	6494792	That's also on my list, too.
6494872	6497234	Actually, now that I'm going to be working, Dan and I are buying a house.
6498054	6501996	Moving to a nicer studio for OLR is definitely on top of my list.
6502016	6504158	That could probably happen if we buy said house.
6504518	6505218	Well, it'll be a race.
6506979	6510622	Anyhow, let's go over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there.
6510642	6513785	We had quite a few answers over there, but I'm in a good mood.
6513805	6516287	We didn't have a lot of news tonight, so we should get through most of these.
6517107	6519489	Andy R. says, Finish more of the games I buy.
6519709	6521110	Damn Steam sales aren't helping.
6522431	6531099	Critical Myths says resolve to finish Mass Effect 3, play the two Dragon Age games, and do even more Assassin's Creed cosplay.
6531880	6535924	Only finish Mass Effect 3 if you have the extended cut DLC downloaded and ready to go.
6536044	6537145	Do it, if you have it.
6537465	6540348	Even if you're like, but I want to see what it was like beforehand first.
6540428	6540628	No.
6541569	6542049	You don't want to.
6542169	6542570	No, you don't.
6543143	6543884	I made that mistake.
6546005	6549787	I watched them on the internet and I was like, download.
6550328	6551028	Exactly.
6551489	6554490	I waited to beat my game so I could download the extended cut.
6555791	6556292	There you go.
6556912	6557192	Alright.
6558573	6559614	Going on to Fifth Dream.
6559734	6566681	I don't believe in making resolutions because I don't keep them, but if I did, it would be to stop hoarding games like a squirrel and his nuts in winter.
6567041	6572266	I seriously probably have more games right now than I've played only once or never than all the other games I've had in my life.
6572646	6575329	Sure, most cost $1.50 to $10, but still.
6575569	6576610	Oh, I have that same problem.
6577030	6578191	Same problem.
6578251	6581054	Degenerate Johnny says, I vow to catch them all this year.
6581474	6582675	Catch what, you might ask?
6582996	6584297	I'll leave it to your imagination.
6584762	6587223	Ooh, you better have a good doctor.
6588184	6590445	He means all the cards in Hearthstone, obviously.
6591565	6598909	Tech2030 says, with a new Tales game and Tales HD re-release coming out next year, I want to go back and play through all the Tales of English releases.
6599389	6603131	I'll get to replay the ones I finished and finally get to play through the ones sitting in my backlog.
6604191	6605333	That's Euros, isn't it?
6620711	6621452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6643127	6645309	Dragon Quest VIII Flashback to 3-4 years ago OLR
6665749	6670033	I actually put the symbols in chat because they do look rather similar at a glance.
6670353	6671254	Yeah, from far away too.
6672875	6678360	Daniel S replied and said, My gaming resolution is to stick to my game and not just jump from game to game.
6678420	6678760	Good luck.
6679501	6682683	To do this, I vow to get at least three platinum trophies in 2014.
6685442	6705162	Codeman responds and says I would really like to dive more into Final Fantasy 14 took a little while off and now everybody has multiple 50s and it's crazy I may have gotten my second 50 this week I would just like to be more involved with a free company and run dungeons more etc etc now just to find the time well you know what they say real life greater than games
6706172	6707353	Yeah, that's been my thing.
6707393	6708133	Well, I'm still only 30.
6709973	6713494	Clover, well, the good thing is that game has level syncing.
6713694	6721557	So, Codeman and DarkSakura and anybody else in our free company, Omnigarsamer, just feel free to ask for help because everybody can level sync down and do stuff and it's still a challenge.
6721657	6726118	And you get, if you have like a level 48 or 49 character, you get great XP from it still.
6726838	6730921	I've actually been using the level syncing a lot for doing Fates so that I can buy a stupid mount.
6732082	6736026	I had to get up to the job level so that I could buy my mount.
6736226	6738207	You know who else has been playing Final Fantasy XIV?
6738448	6739268	Bobby Blackwolf.
6739368	6740850	Bobby Blackwolf finally got into it.
6740890	6742491	He hasn't talked much about it, but he's playing.
6744933	6748975	Clover Nikon says purchase a Playstation 4 the latter half of 2014.
6749015	6751917	My wife and I both agree that any issues should be ironed out by them.
6752078	6752398	Good luck.
6753298	6754019	I want to get one too.
6754079	6755780	Hopefully a little sooner but we'll see.
6755860	6758242	Ragenator says I don't really do New Year's resolutions.
6758282	6762525	The closest thing to that is what I've been doing all along since this past March.
6762965	6766368	Buy more Steam games, preferably when they're on sale, and play more games.
6767729	6780399	Awesome Unicorn replied and said, My gaming resolution for 2014 is to ensure that no more than 50% of my playtime in Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII is spent recoloring and accessorizing Lightning's outfits.
6780839	6782740	This will take all of my willpower.
6782820	6789706	I really like that answer because the extras in Final Fantasy and how far they really go, that is such an appropriate answer.
6789726	6789866	Just in
6790106	6803208	any game I probably sat there longer creating my character in Saints Row 3 than I did actually playing it that first night I might be ashamed to say how much time I've killed in Super Mario 64 stretching Mario's face in weird ways
6804926	6805686	That's part of the fun.
6806407	6811109	Osfer replies and says, I must play Final Fantasy X HD or else I will probably cry.
6811589	6815871	Also hoping that XV is released in 2014 after we've waited for so damn long.
6817012	6822494	SSJ100Matt is last and says, My gaming resolution is to actually make a classic gaming setup in my place.
6822974	6828217	I have the bulk of my classic gaming stuff in boxes and have to keep swapping them out when I want to play anything.
6828637	6831478	What I would like is a full and nicely organized setup.
6832179	6832619	That's a...
6832999	6835161	Retro N5?
6835342	6836423	Or just Retro N?
6836523	6837304	What was that thing called?
6837424	6840847	I call it the Retron 5 just because I love Tron.
6841728	6850196	I know it's cheating, but considering what you have to do to get enough inputs for classic games like that, not to mention if you don't even have composite.
6850937	6853700	And on top of that, a modern TV is going to have...
6856526	6866152	The way that we did ours at the old house was that we had the switch boxes behind with these demo monitors that Dan got when Game Crazy closed.
6867053	6873497	And with our switch boxes and the component in, we were just able to hit the box in the middle and we had everything out on one shelf.
6873517	6883925	There's another guy who has his set up to where he used crates with LED lights at the top of each crate so that it would turn on whatever system was active.
6883945	6884165	Mm-hmm.
6884805	6886025	and there's ways to do it.
6886065	6894348	You have to get a little creative, but there are ways to organize it to where not only are your systems there ready to play, but they are also on display.
6894408	6898689	It's a little foolish for me to jump straight to the retro end because compatibility, if nothing else...
6902290	6929265	the HDMI, I mean like TigerClaw says in the chatroom, Retron 5 looks interesting the fact you can play your old games over HDMI that right there is so appealing to me just the cable space and everything I know it's not the same same but close enough I have, because of my emulation history and everything else, I would have no problem with something like that, not to mention I don't own those classic systems anymore I've given a lot of them away to various friends that don't need new gaming consoles and just want to play an old fun game
6929985	6939275	and so I've helped them along with that not to mention the only system I owned before Playstation was an SNES but I have neither anymore you own one?
6940356	6951968	I think we have three or four well I think all my games went with it we have extras I am not in the mood to start scavenging and building up and paying for all those cartridges again
6952569	6954773	We actually are probably going to be downsizing the vault, by the way.
6955074	6955775	Oh no.
6957518	6958760	You want to move with all that stuff?
6959161	6960183	Yeah.
6960724	6963008	A good two-thirds of it is in storage at Dan's mom's house.
6964471	6965511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6993761	6999823	Alright, let's get into some more news, and then we'll get into list lists and all that in just a little bit.
7000143	7001044	Loki, you want to start us off?
7002024	7011907	So, like most console games, now Battlefield 4 has been banned in China, and probably has a little bit to do with the China Rising expansion.
7012607	7016049	They say that it was banned for national security reasons.
7017269	7023191	So, I don't know, maybe they just didn't like the view of China in that game.
7025393	7036397	Well, do you think it's one of those games where EA might want to put out a different version to try, or just no, they're just going to write it off?
7037377	7038357	I think they're going to write it off.
7038377	7039298	I kind of think so, too.
7039318	7048421	Because basically, the main problem with it is that they're saying that the campaign of that takes place, a Chinese admiral is planning to overthrow the government.
7049041	7053803	That's something that they really want to promote or glorify there.
7055424	7056504	Very, very true.
7056884	7061486	Do games have similar scenarios with just the legit American government?
7062166	7067928	It's usually like you're taking down a terrorist faction that already did the deed of overthrowing the government.
7068708	7071649	Or future post-apocalyptic, something like that.
7071909	7074330	I'm thinking like Modern Warfare 2 and 3, that kind of stuff.
7076730	7085153	There's always some sort of corrupt government entity in any of these, especially a lot of the military first-person shooters and stuff.
7086311	7095878	Yeah, always some kind of a nefarious, what's the word, ne'er-do-well that is the actual focal point of all of this kind of stuff.
7097509	7099410	Dragon Quest X is an MMO game that exists on the Wii U.
7117000	7119881	but some people still talking about Dragon Quest XI.
7120441	7126622	Now, I guess there was some thought that Dragon Quest XI could be mobile, that it could end up being a mobile game.
7126662	7133683	I mean, after all, Square has been putting out more and more stuff on the iPhone, iPad, iOS system and Android and so forth.
7133703	7136643	You know, like, what, Final Fantasy 3, 4, 5 are all there.
7136983	7139684	I think 6 actually just is coming out or just came out.
7140404	7145585	I kind of stopped downloading all those because they're a little bit pricey and, you know, they're not as good as the originals.
7146005	7173453	but some folks thinking that Dragon Quest XI might go that way but Square Enix mobile developer Takehiro Ando would like to clarify some things in a Fumitsu column saying quote at the current stage there are no talks about making Dragon Quest XI for smartphones I believe there's still plenty left to overcome before we release a proper sequel for smartphones so we don't know when Dragon Quest XI will be out or what system it will be on I would
7173993	7181278	I can't imagine it nearly matches the experience of Dragon Quest X on like Wii U or something, but then again, you'd be surprised.
7201853	7204214	It was originally on Wii, now that I think about it.
7204254	7205214	Wii U was like a special version.
7205234	7206214	It was originally on Wii.
7206475	7208735	You'd be surprised how well some of this stuff can do mobily.
7209696	7215938	There's a fair number of MOBAs and MMOs and they find ways of making it work.
7216058	7220819	Input schemes that people are willing to put up with to play on their favorite franchise.
7222400	7223660	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7224696	7225257	Thank you for watching!
7241660	7250087	Um, the collection is including the Atari 2600, the ColecoVision, but the games don't yet have sound, however they will.
7250688	7255252	And like I said, the BBC is covering this now because the archive apparently is expanding.
7257433	7257654	So.
7258054	7258254	Hmm.
7259035	7260676	What kind of cool stuff can I play in there?
7261997	7262678	Well, um...
7264702	7269563	The worry is that some of these are going to be illegal because they're ROMs.
7269743	7270984	You have to have the emulator to play them.
7272584	7280906	But the much older games are supposed to be available for legal play and it's not actually listing a specific type.
7280986	7281586	Okay, there we go.
7281606	7283907	Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Frogger are in the archives.
7284487	7292249	They are also including Atari 7800, Magnavox Odyssey, which in Europe was the Philips VideoPak G7000, and the Astrocade.
7293269	7293369	So...
7294943	7295183	There you go.
7295423	7296664	There you go.
7296684	7297605	Yeah, it's expanded.
7298845	7308651	All right, well, from the classics to the future, you guys, it's time to predict 2014 in a segment we call here at Orange Lounge Radio, Listless!
7311886	7320532	Alright, and of course, as the show where every gamer has a voice, you guys listening live play an important role in the listless process.
7320572	7324575	So head on over to live.vognetwork.com so you can play along with us.
7325195	7332601	Those of you listening on the podcast, I'm sorry we don't yet have the functionality for the podcast listeners to participate to, but that is something we are working on for 2014.
7332681	7336564	So listen along and have fun with us as we predict tonight's question...
7338484	7340805	What will happen in gaming in 2014?
7341386	7344127	What are your gaming predictions for 2014?
7344467	7355252	Now to take a walk down memory lane real quick, let me see if I can pull this up real quick because we actually have, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's an Orange Lounge Radio Wikia.
7355652	7355972	DarkSakura.com
7373032	7374552	On this show, what is the inside joke?
7375113	7380474	You can check that out, orangeloungeradio.wikia.com Midna found the ferret, by the way Did she?
7380754	7401581	Yes Well, one of the pages there on the wikia is listless And it tells you every definitive list we've ever come up with here on Orange Lounge Radio Because this is a process where we will come up with the definitive list And so last year, at this time, we did 2013 predictions So shall I remind you about what we predicted for 2013?
7402841	7404362	The Xbox Lube is $100 with Commitment
7434588	7438993	A Vita price drop before the first anniversary, which that did happen, right?
7439173	7439754	That did happen.
7440074	7442197	And then Final Fantasy XI goes free to play.
7442257	7443498	So we were one for four.
7444319	7444860	There we go.
7445060	7448103	Instead of the Xbox loop being $100 worth of commitment, it's $100 more with dementia and brainwashing.
7451727	7457055	Hey, there's the voice of Alan Alchemy who's going to be sitting in on Listless with us tonight.
7457095	7457495	Hi, Alan.
7457535	7457856	How are you?
7458296	7458497	What?
7458917	7460159	What a good introduction there.
7460419	7460620	All right.
7460660	7466448	I had to fade the music there a little earlier because I don't want YouTube saying, oh, oh, you don't own that song.
7467109	7467650	So there we go.
7468110	7469192	Alright, getting into listless night.
7469452	7474681	For those of you that have never heard listless before, it is a very scientific process.
7474701	7476684	There is no arguing people with this list.
7477745	7482373	This is the list of predictions for 2014, the official gaming community predictions.
7483354	7484495	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7507054	7508214	So let's put it up on the board.
7508274	7511356	Here we go over at live.vognetwork.com.
7511436	7514016	What are your gaming predictions for 2014?
7514377	7524200	Participating tonight with us, of course, DarkSakura, Loki, VXJasonXV, the voice of the show, myself, and Alan Alchemy, as you just heard there a minute ago.
7524220	7525400	Which, by the way, how are you, Alan?
7525420	7526521	What have you been playing these days?
7526721	7528961	What does a gaming week look like for you these days?
7529181	7530702	Lots of Final Fantasy XIV.
7530842	7531102	Yeah?
7531942	7533683	What have you been accomplishing in that game?
7534495	7535717	I'm working on my relic.
7536678	7537459	Working on your relic?
7537659	7539040	His big number has been getting bigger.
7539261	7539721	That's right.
7539781	7540642	Big number's getting bigger.
7541363	7542184	Monster's getting bigger.
7542324	7543185	Fight's getting crazier.
7543745	7543986	Alright.
7545182	7545402	DarkSakura
7570498	7574200	What is your number three pick for gaming prediction for 2014?
7574580	7576301	Serious or silly, whatever you want.
7577061	7579722	World of Warcraft loses over a million subscribers over the course of 2014.
7581063	7583004	So WoW loses a million more.
7583944	7584184	Over.
7584204	7587506	A minimum of a million subscribers over the course of 2014.
7588306	7590947	Okay, so why do you say that?
7591427	7592288	Because it's shit.
7596225	7608832	I still like WoW I just don't think the new expansion even with as much as it kind of had me excited I don't think it's enough to save it it's too little too late they're just throwing bones now
7609632	7627545	and yeah they may get a few lore nerds back and happy and I'm a lore nerd I liked I how many of those books are on my shelves you know and I would probably you know play for a week to see the content and then quit again so it's just not enough for me
7628012	7631455	After Mario Kart 8 fails to sell enough consoles for Nintendo, they will finally drop the price.
7654209	7657370	I think Mario Kart 8 is going to do fucking fantastic, but I think a price drop is going to happen.
7657390	7658350	Yeah, that's my thing too.
7658370	7660531	I also think Mario Kart 8 is going to do really well.
7660571	7661671	But why do you think it's going to fail?
7661691	7665993	You just think it's going to fail because there's not going to be the Wii U's out there or whatever?
7678634	7684037	I think it can still be a good game, but it's just not going to be enough for people to buy the console for.
7684077	7690941	I mean, some people might, but it's just not going to be enough to make a huge enough difference to where all of a sudden it's going to be a 3DS.
7692046	7695308	Well, it's a good thing we have an elimination round.
7695389	7700372	The question is, am I being meaner by saying that it's going to drop anyways as compared to Loki?
7701113	7703014	No, because I do think it will drop in price.
7703054	7705376	I mean, all the consoles will drop in price next holiday.
7705416	7705956	They all will.
7706136	7707737	And the Wii U will be two years old next year.
7707757	7708958	Yeah, but we'll see.
7709599	7709959	So there it is.
7709979	7711100	I'm going to put it on the board anyway.
7711160	7714182	Mario Kart 8 fails, Wii U price dropped.
7714722	7719886	Jason, I know you just said he jacked one of your answers, but I've got to pick on you now.
7719906	7721307	Number three, what's your number three answer?
7721727	7723190	Half-Life 3?
7723431	7724232	Question mark?
7724493	7725374	Smiley face?
7725595	7726416	Frowny face?
7726597	7727599	Won't get released
7731994	7735618	Half-Life 3, question mark, smiley face, won't get released.
7736178	7746668	Won't get released, which is kind of vague because that allows for an announcement or do you think 2014 is going to be a complete information void toilet for Half-Life 3 still?
7746748	7747990	I mean, it already has been.
7748931	7750072	Hasn't it always been?
7751813	7756158	I don't expect it to change, but I'm going to stick squarely with no Half-Life 3.
7757618	7784303	so there it is up on the board Half-Life 3 won't get released up on the board next to duh and of course alright I'm just kidding alright alright my number three answer I'll go next with my number three answer my number three answer and I know I'm gonna have like two of you guys going god damn it that's what I picked my number three answer is Ouya goes under Ouya calls it a day I just I
7785263	7786725	I think it's... You went there?
7787125	7798477	I went there, I'm sorry, but it's just one of those things that had a huge fanfare and now it's kind of went... And, you know, I realize they're doing great things for indies and all that, but I just... But OUYA 2, Rob, OUYA 2.
7798517	7800098	Yeah, OUYA 2 soon, so...
7802340	7803041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7820720	7827085	Alright, they're going to lose a million subs, and then they're going to fail and you're still not going to get your damn game, and then the company's going to go under.
7827786	7832970	Alright, Alan, maybe you have a cheerful number three answer, or maybe you don't, but what is your number three answer?
7833250	7842477	Actually, you pointing that out made me think of something really dark and grim that I wasn't going to say previously, so whether or not I say it is... Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!
7842878	7843978	Who wants Alan to go there?
7844339	7847221	Go there, go there, go there!
7847641	7851263	One of the big Nintendo godfathers of gaming will pass away.
7852323	7852963	Stop.
7853084	7854444	That is too soon.
7854724	7855325	No.
7855445	7856365	You can't say that.
7856405	7857105	Yes, he can.
7857465	7859086	The Zelda Mario dude.
7859846	7860227	One of them.
7860287	7861147	The Final Fantasy.
7861327	7862808	One of the big 8-bit godfathers.
7862828	7864549	You are awful and you should feel awful.
7864589	7867150	They're all like pushing 70, right?
7867410	7868830	That's not very old anymore.
7869251	7871892	Well, it's true, but people fall downstairs every day.
7873833	7879077	This is supposed to be a funny segment, you guys!
7880118	7882119	I wouldn't have thought of it if you didn't point it out.
7882240	7887243	I'm gonna need everybody to eliminate number three answers.
7887964	7892247	But wouldn't falling down stairs be kind of ironic in the whole Paul Walker ironic?
7892307	7897451	Because, you know, they do have to climb stairs at the very end of each Mario level to jump on the goalposts.
7898064	7903425	No, it would be ironic if he gets kidnapped by a monkey and taken to the top of a skyrise.
7903505	7904586	That would be ironic.
7907006	7907406	All right.
7908087	7908447	Wow.
7909067	7914128	So I'm going to need us all to – let's try to make it a little bit happier going to number two, and then we'll just eliminate all the threes.
7914248	7914548	All right.
7915528	7916008	All right.
7916069	7916889	Let's try again.
7916949	7920750	Your number two – so far, since I have to read it anyway, the super dark 2014 –
7922330	7923971	Gaming Crash, number two predictions list.
7924591	7926051	WoW loses a million subs over the year.
7926151	7927192	Mario Kart 8 fails.
7927232	7927992	Wii U price drop.
7928212	7929532	Half-Life 3 won't get released.
7929633	7932273	Ouya goes under and 8-bit Godfather passes.
7932533	7932874	All right.
7933914	7935274	Let's go on to the number two.
7935414	7936675	Happy, shiny answers.
7936755	7937455	DarkSakura.
7937655	7938455	Stop influencing me.
7938636	7938916	All right.
7939336	7941036	DarkSakura, what is your number two answer?
7941176	7945898	There will be another huge shipping war on Tumblr based on screenshots for the next Mass Effect.
7948783	7950687	And remind us if you do not know what shipping means.
7957771	7984344	relationships people fucking because it's fan driven there's a big annoyance I have with just oh these two characters are friends they're fucking no they might not be fucking but no it's basically the shipping is going to happen based on screen captures people are going to make assumptions Tumblr is going to piss themselves and ship all the things
7985427	7989811	So DarkSakura's number two answer, the internet will exist, is up on the board.
7989871	7990511	No, no, no.
7991552	7993614	Rule 34 will continue its stride.
7993654	7995515	Mass Effect 4 will be shipped before it ships.
7995676	7998378	Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.
7998478	8003922	I guess I should really change that to say new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.
8003942	8006144	We'll change that answer a little bit there and alter that on the board.
8006905	8007205	All right.
8007785	8010468	Loki, dare I ask, your number two answer.
8011693	8013496	I actually don't have a negative one this time.
8013756	8019926	I was going to say Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 will be out next year.
8023257	8023617	There it is.
8023717	8027621	Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 makes its way out next year.
8027961	8028641	Seems logical.
8028842	8035287	It's going to be really weird when L4D4, Left 4 Dead 4 comes out just because numbers.
8035707	8043874	The thought was because when they announced Portal 2 they made Portal 1 free to download temporarily.
8044434	8050900	Same with Left 4 Dead 2 just happened where they made it free for a day just to build up the user base of it.
8050960	8051100	So
8051843	8053844	Most likely an announcement will be coming soon for that.
8055265	8067753	I've theorized previously that Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 running for a year will be the testing, putting the toe in the water that Valve needs to make any sort of announcement on Half-Life 3.
8067933	8069474	Nope!
8069994	8070575	Announcement?
8072416	8073397	We did have that conversation.
8073417	8074518	But that's not even an entry.
8074678	8076120	That's just... No, that's fine.
8076140	8076900	That's fine.
8076980	8077981	Besides, it's not your turn.
8079122	8080824	Jason, what is your number two answer?
8080844	8082825	I'm personally ready for L4D20.
8083806	8084046	Sorry.
8084327	8084607	Anyways.
8085968	8088390	Oculus Rift released 4K resolution.
8091313	8093435	As opposed to their current expectation, which is...
8095448	8105556	128800?
8095588	8105556	I was gonna say, we know Oculus Rift is coming, but you say Oculus Rift is gonna, it's gonna They're gonna blow something away with resolution and quality and not just current expectations.
8105576	8107338	It is real fucking life, y'all.
8107358	8107698	Pretty much.
8108078	8109860	Oculus Rift, real fucking life.
8110660	8111441	Alright, fair enough.
8111481	8113162	There it is, up on the board.
8113903	8123270	Alright, that is so funny that you bring up the Oculus Rift, and it is really funny because also in chat we had SSJ100Matt says, one of the big three will announce an Oculus Rift type of device.
8123290	8129375	Well, funny enough, I swear I had this written before the show tonight, but my number two answer, Microsoft jacks the Rift.
8130896	8132757	What does Microsoft love to do?
8132958	8138402	They are going to take an idea that's popular in gaming and improve on it best they can.
8138542	8140623	I fully expect Microsoft to jack the Rift.
8140643	8142424	I'm not sure improve is the case either.
8142485	8144726	Why not buy Oculus Rift?
8144766	8148269	Because for Microsoft to fit that MO perfectly, they usually absorb
8148849	8150030	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8178507	8182108	But Microsoft jacks the rift is my number two answer, and I'm putting it up on the board.
8182168	8182448	All right.
8183529	8187010	Alan Alchemy, last but not least, with your number two answer.
8187550	8198193	Nintendo finally brings DS, not 3DS, but DS ROMs to a store on the Wii U. And somehow they make it disappointing.
8202092	8205595	I love how you had to tack on the, and it's disappointing, just to keep it down.
8205615	8213542	Whether it be the price, or the games that they actually announce for it, or how it plays, they'll do it and it'll somehow still be stupid.
8214382	8216824	Alright, again, another dark answer tonight.
8216864	8220748	Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints.
8221468	8222269	Womp womp.
8222729	8224610	All right, there it is, your number two answer.
8224650	8227231	All right, let's run through the board real quick.
8227612	8229793	We have new Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.
8229853	8231354	WoW loses a million subs over the year.
8231694	8233215	Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 is out.
8233255	8235316	Mario Kart 8 fails and the Wii U price has dropped.
8235696	8237737	Oculus Rift released in 4K resolution.
8237997	8239458	Half-Life 3 won't get released.
8239758	8240879	Microsoft jacks the Rift.
8240999	8241699	Ouya goes under.
8241899	8244461	Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints.
8244701	8256465	8-Bit Godfather Passes Alright, now it is time for the number one answer The thing you most predict for 2014 DarkSakura, what is your number one prediction?
8260386	8272770	I've actually been drawing a blank the entire time I mean, so I am going to say that an innovation within the video game industry leads to new advances for people with disabilities
8277395	8280357	Like maybe Vision for the Blind.
8280397	8283998	They're already working on bionic ocular implants.
8284599	8286420	Those are a legit thing now.
8287240	8290562	Maybe they're working on bionic oculus rift plans.
8293111	8295453	I need to knock this shit off real fast.
8295593	8296094	I'm sorry.
8296174	8300198	So an unknown innovation in the video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.
8300258	8302160	I had to shorten that a little bit.
8302260	8303381	We're already seeing it happen.
8303841	8308166	So I think that something really big is going to happen that's going to turn around a lot of the negative press.
8308766	8309167	Let's hope.
8310528	8311569	Loki, did you have something to add to that?
8313095	8315877	Oh, I was just telling Jason to stop it.
8317779	8320501	Alright, well, shut them up with your number one answer, Loki.
8320521	8322742	What is the number one prediction for 2014?
8323703	8332469	I've only been saying this the entire year, but I'm hoping that they'll do this because they'll definitely beef up what they have available for the system.
8333790	8342557	3DS games on the Wii U using the gamepad as the bottom screen, TV as the top screen.
8344161	8351583	So you're going to just one-up what Alan said and say 3DS games on the Wii U. Well, I've been saying it all year long.
8352003	8353904	It's an inevitability.
8354644	8355244	Fair enough.
8355404	8356465	Alright, you can put what he wants.
8356485	8356785	There it is.
8356865	8361246	Loki's up on the board with 3DS games on the Wii U. He did leave out the point, though, that it disappoints.
8361386	8362366	So, for what it's worth.
8362426	8362986	Alright, there it is.
8363627	8364507	Alright, so there it is.
8364567	8365567	Loki's number one answer.
8365607	8366487	Jason, we're over to you.
8366527	8368288	What is your number one prediction?
8368888	8370348	Um... Jesus.
8371349	8371489	Um...
8374125	8385168	Let's go with indie game released to such fanfare they get signed on to a major publisher for a AAA release.
8386088	8393230	The release doesn't have to happen, but the groundswell and fanfare has to happen in 2014.
8393830	8399712	Indie game signed on to produce AAA port of same game.
8401670	8406951	I'm going to try to shorten that to say Indie goes from Indie to AAA in the scope of a year.
8407891	8408151	It works.
8408371	8408972	Makes sense.
8409312	8411532	I'm going to say Indie Game and put that on the board.
8411972	8414493	Any idea what that type of game could be?
8416693	8417193	A good one.
8417213	8418434	If you knew it, you'd be a millionaire.
8418454	8418814	Come on.
8419634	8419894	All right.
8419914	8420674	You'd be a millionaire.
8420834	8421174	All right.
8422074	8424335	Bochikawa says, so like what happened with Portal?
8425175	8426835	Something like that, right?
8427676	8430876	Yeah, that actually was kind of it because it was that Narbacular Drop.
8432977	8434777	Alright, my number one answer.
8435457	8435838	Here it is.
8435898	8436598	It's a long one.
8436618	8438398	I don't know how I'm going to shorten this for the board, but here it is.
8438458	8439298	My number one answer.
8440879	8446560	In 2014, the year of Captain Falcon, F-Zero U is announced.
8446940	8450721	It's the greatest game ever made and Wii U haters can shove it.
8451906	8469695	Falcon Punch That is my number one answer, Falcon Punch F-Zero Boner Party That's how you condense that down That works, Nintendo's Year of Captain Falcon That's what they're going to call it, F-Zero Boner Party Nintendo's Year of Falcon Punch Nintendo's Year of Falcon Boner
8472265	8473686	I will accept that shortening.
8473746	8477507	Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.
8477827	8478947	Fair enough, I like it.
8479027	8481468	It is up on the board as my number one answer.
8481908	8487930	Alright, that means we are down to one more prediction to go up on the board.
8487990	8490411	Just before we hear Alan's answer, some of the things we see in chat.
8491352	8518934	Tech2030 says Nintendo comes out with a 3DS player peripheral for the Wii U Fifth Dream says a Final Fantasy XIV expansion GameGuru says 2014 the year we predict disappointments in gaming Tigerclaw says in 2014 Gabe Newell will announce the release date for the Half-Life movie Degenerate Johnny says Nintendo pulls a Disney and starts buying up purchasable third-party LPs or IPs maybe
8521913	8523214	I think he was saying Let's Plays.
8523554	8524636	Oh, Let's Plays.
8524996	8525496	Oh, I got it.
8525576	8525897	I got it.
8526658	8529560	Degenerate Johnny says Hearthstone will remain in beta throughout the whole year.
8529681	8531202	That's a womp womp.
8531723	8532083	All right.
8532383	8533224	I liked SSJ 100 Nets.
8533244	8534025	What was that one?
8534345	8536067	I'm going to get thrown out next year.
8536848	8537989	You already got thrown out last week.
8538009	8538850	That's exactly what I said.
8538950	8539270	All right.
8539610	8541252	But it can happen again in 2014.
8541412	8543494	Alan, there is one spot left on the list.
8543674	8545116	What do you put in there as your number one prediction?
8545504	8555935	Bethesda confirms and gives an ETA for either the next campaign Elder Scrolls game or Fallout 4 That's too wide of a net Which one?
8556956	8563563	Fallout 4 We've been waiting longer for that So Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 And gives an ETA And gives an ETA
8565199	8567100	Wasn't there an article about that in the last week or two?
8568280	8569241	Sounds awfully familiar.
8569321	8570742	It's going to be probably out in October.
8570862	8571322	Oh, yeah.
8571442	8572162	I'm sure that's a guy.
8572182	8573263	I think that's an E3 given.
8573463	8573983	Absolutely.
8574023	8574864	All right.
8575064	8575264	Sorry.
8575284	8575504	All right.
8575804	8576344	So here it is.
8577065	8577865	Here it is, you guys.
8577925	8579326	Here's what the board says right now.
8580126	8582907	Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.
8583268	8585168	New Mass Effect screenshot causes shipping war.
8585529	8587790	WoW loses 1 million subs over the year.
8587810	8590611	3DS games on the Wii U. Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.
8590911	8593892	Mario Kart 8 fails and Wii U prices dropped.
8594312	8596733	Indie game goes from Indie to AAA in the scope of a year.
8597013	8599093	Oculus Rift released with a 4K resolution.
8599393	8601114	Half-Life 3 won't get released.

8607616	8609756	Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives ETA.
8610076	8613077	Nintendo brings DS ROMs to Wii U store and disappoints.
8613597	8615858	And 8-bit Godfather passes.
8615958	8617538	I got a name for Microsoft's Rift.
8617718	8617959	What?
8618039	8618559	The Jacked.
8619099	8619399	What?
8620019	8620440	Be quiet.
8620820	8621120	Alright.
8621140	8622721	I thought that was a really good name.
8623342	8625383	Because you're jacked into the game.
8625403	8631407	But you know, that is so opening it up to... I'm gonna get jacked on my X-Bone, you guys.
8631427	8632648	Yeah, I'm jacking my X-Bone.
8632668	8632808	Duh.
8634246	8636708	DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8659369	8666932	I'm not going to say it's not worthy of the list, but I just want to be a little bit less morbid, and I'm sorry, Alan, but I'm going to take off the 8-bit, Godfather.
8667452	8668853	So nobody else has to.
8669333	8675535	I kind of thought that was going to go... To be fair, we brought... Even though it's probably going to happen.
8675935	8677276	We brought it on ourselves.
8677916	8680537	He said it was going to be dark, and we made him do it.
8680997	8682598	I honestly think it's going to happen.
8682618	8684899	So I'm going to take it off.
8684939	8688360	Well, it is stricken from the list, so we don't have to talk about it anymore.
8689580	8690961	Loki, you're up next.
8691001	8695323	I don't know if you can see the board there over at live.vognetwork.com, but which of these is not worthy of the list?
8696204	8698505	Only because it doesn't really make any sense to me.
8698705	8700285	It just seems very uninteresting.
8700386	8704127	New Mass Effect Screenshot causes shipping war.
8704267	8704848	New Mass Effect.
8705088	8708730	Well, to be fair, of course that's going to happen.
8708770	8709430	She's not wrong.
8710916	8728102	I know I'm not wrong that's a guarantee it's too safe a prediction and we're too edgy here at OLR for that so it is stricken from the list alright, fair enough Jason, it's a tough job but that's what we do here at OLR which of these is not worthy of the list?
8728682	8731243	Oculus only has one C by the way that's okay
8731465	8733626	Will you strike something from the list?
8733646	8734447	You want me to strike that?
8734487	8735828	I'm striking a letter from the list.
8735848	8736648	You're striking a letter.
8736688	8736988	All right.
8737028	8739010	It has been stricken from the list.
8739090	8739610	My goodness.
8739890	8741391	That letter has been stricken from the list.
8741751	8742071	Shit.
8742211	8743612	There are two very, very good ones.
8743913	8746494	And which one do I think is less likely of the two?
8747935	8751037	I am going to toss out 3DS games on the Wii U.
8751986	8759595	Oh, 3DS games on the Wii U. You're going to stick with Alan's more morbid prediction that it's just the regular DS and it disappoints.
8759695	8768866	I don't think either one of them because the 3DS plays DS titles, but definitely not 3DS games on the Wii U, unfortunately.
8769406	8769846	I would love it.
8769866	8770567	Ain't gonna happen.
8791040	8794262	I think, again, just like the Mass Effect thing, that's too safe of a prediction.
8794322	8797604	Of course, the Wii U price is going to drop, and I don't think Mario Kart 8 will fail.
8797644	8800366	I think it'll be the second biggest game on the console next to Mario 3D World.
8800646	8803587	So, sorry, Loki, but it is stricken from the list.
8803607	8809791	But that does mean Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 coming out, that gets immunity, and Alan may not remove it from the list.
8810191	8813553	So, Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8814694	8819837	Like a panicked engineer with a crowbar in his hand, Half-Life 3 won't get released, is
8822151	8824613	You are not allowing that to happen.
8824673	8824993	All right.
8825133	8825694	Fair enough.
8826615	8827455	Sorry, Jason.
8827515	8829697	But again, too safe, Jason.
8829717	8831839	Good point.
8832439	8832799	All right.
8833160	8834681	It is stricken from the list.
8835061	8835902	So there it is, guys.
8835922	8837163	That was a very tough process.
8837203	8838063	It was like pulling teeth.
8838364	8839184	But here we go.
8839665	8841286	The answers you have left to vote for.
8841686	8844348	Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.
8844668	8846430	WoW loses a million subs over the year.
8846510	8848051	Left 4 Dead 3 and Source 2 are out.
8848391	8873011	Indie Game goes from Indie to AAA in the scope of a year Oculus Rift released at 4K resolution Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party Microsoft jacks the Rift Ouya goes under Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA Nintendo brings DS ROMs to the Wii U store and disappoints Those are some hefty choices, you guys, but you can vote now Now, some of you might be thinking, oh, all of those are going to come true
8873351	8876054	Well, you're going to click on your number one and your number two.
8876114	8880418	Remember, the first one you click is your number one, and the second one you click is your number two.
8880498	8884021	Those are the ones you like the best of those answers that are up on the board.
8884082	8885323	So have at it.
8885663	8890708	It is now live, and you can vote for the next few minutes there at live.vognetwork.com.
8890768	8892810	It is a live poll, and you may now vote.
8893190	8897074	And we will tally up those answers and read the answers here in just a little bit.
8898355	8898716	All right.
8899216	8900116	Good times.
8900317	8900957	Good times.
8901678	8902898	A little morbid, but that's all right.
8902918	8906241	I think we cleaned up the list pretty good there at the end, so it's a little less morbid.
8907281	8911924	We got a few more stories for you guys, though, before we get to the answers and the FUs of the week and all that good stuff.
8911984	8913926	So, Loki, why don't you start us off?
8914706	8916187	Thank you, Alan, by the way, for participating.
8916207	8917248	We'll let you know if one of yours wins.
8917268	8918469	Okay.
8918669	8926094	So, hey, just in case you wanted to check it out, there's another Telltale series that's free to try.
8926134	8927815	At least they have the first episode.
8928288	8929908	for free right now, The Wolf Among Us.
8930689	8933750	And you can get that free on Xbox Live Arcade.
8934090	8937451	And I'm not sure how long that's supposed to be free for, so better act fast.
8937631	8940471	And they're also doing discounts for some other stuff for the end of the year.
8940491	8944293	They've been marking down stuff, I think, all the way up through New Year's.
8944353	8945873	So go check it out.
8948231	8950332	I've heard a lot of really good things about this game.
8950352	8951333	This is another one of those.
8951413	8953694	I should have played it in 2013, but oops, I didn't.
8954915	8956276	So yes, I'm very curious.
8956296	8956776	Check this out.
8956816	8961059	Wait, wait, before you run away, Alan, don't you read, you read a lot of these graphic novels and stuff.
8961139	8964721	Are you familiar with this, this Fables that the Telltale one's based off of?
8965655	8969138	I have the first three volumes in the office, so yeah.
8969158	8970199	Are you going to check this out?
8970219	8971079	Are you curious about this game?
8972240	8978024	It depends on what spoilers it has for the comics, because I'm only on volume three of the trade paperback, and they're like on, what, volume 30?
8979305	8981787	So I checked it out like four years ago and haven't touched it since.
8982568	8982848	Uh-oh.
8983028	8983408	All right.
8984329	8986731	You can still mark it for download, you know, just in case.
8989534	9001764	Alright, well, you know, as most Telltale games, if you wait a little longer, it'll probably be like five bucks for the whole thing at some point, but at the same time, I've been hearing great things about it, so I don't know how much longer we can wait, so we'll check that out soon.
9002485	9003866	Alright, Jason, what do you got for us?
9005331	9007373	A couple months ago, the Mighty No.
9007653	9012097	9 gang held a vote to determine the design of Beck's Helper Call.
9012497	9015720	Those votes have been counted and design number F!
9017081	9017581	Take a bow.
9017781	9023366	Take a virtual radio bow for everybody but the YouTube listeners because I can drive that point home.
9024826	9028367	Design F only won by less than 3%.
9028487	9030028	Design H came in third.
9030168	9033189	And Design E was the close rejection.
9033249	9038190	I really want to see what... I should be able to go see the vote and see what Design E is.
9038210	9042572	Because I really, really dig Design F. Very, very, you know...
9043812	9052098	Golden blonde hair, predominantly red, kind of lollipop striping, very appropriate, but really a good design.
9052659	9057442	Let's see, design F, that's E, this will probably take me a minute.
9057522	9063066	So we finally have the primary two protagonists in Mighty No.
9063086	9067870	9, Beck and Call, and what each of them look like, their relevant primary color scheme, and so forth.
9068939	9073221	She kind of looks like one of those cinnamon candy canes to me with the pink and red striping.
9073241	9082225	I mean, I know this is a radio show, so I can't really show you the pictures, but just imagine the whole Mega Man style, which obviously they're changing just ever so slightly for this Mighty No.
9082405	9085446	9, but she's more of one of those cinnamon candy canes with big blonde hair.
9085586	9085867	I don't know.
9085907	9088828	I think he was pretty good, too, taking a look at that.
9089128	9090969	They have the designs.
9090989	9094450	If you go to the second page of the Kickstarter, there's a link on the article there.
9094930	9096051	It shows the different designs.
9096807	9101631	It looks like she's going to get something with her ears, like helicopter ears or something, so that'll be cute.
9101731	9104193	Those are, oh jeez, what are those called?
9106295	9112700	They're basically like hair, I want to say a hair tie, but that's completely incorrect.
9113481	9117064	It's a hair tie in a bow, basically, is what's going on there.
9118165	9135776	And suddenly my chat is not working anymore, so I can't paste this in chat No, they got it, and Pochikawa put it in there too It completely stopped updating for me, so I can't even see it Because tonight is my night of puns, should I read the puntastic quote at the bottom of this article?
9136637	9143742	Sure Some of you may have just met Design F, and think it's crazy But she's got the numbers, so she's call now, baby
9147728	9149329	That is definitely going to do it for the news for 2013.
9149569	9154692	That is the last news article we are reading this year.
9155233	9156253	No Mighty No.
9156273	9158395	9 in our 2014 predictions, but I am very much looking forward to it.
9158595	9159895	Oh, that's because it'll happen.
9159915	9160596	It'll be amazing.
9160896	9162197	That would have been a very safe prediction.
9162637	9165999	Well, they said it's going to come out in 2014 when the Kickstarter whole thing happened.
9167080	9168361	I think, was it supposed to be 2015?
9168421	9168921	Oh, it was 2014.
9169201	9169401	Uh-oh.
9171835	9172015	Oh, wow.
9203240	9205821	Alright, well, it is about that time.
9205861	9212623	We're almost to the part of the show where we're going to take calls, but first we want to hear from our listeners in a segment we call the Mailbag.
9213764	9222867	Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangelaundry.com and DarkSakura dives into the Mailbag headfirst and finds a few emails that she thinks, oh, this is worth looking at.
9223607	9224607	Let's talk about this tonight.
9224707	9225628	I like D-Best.
9225908	9226668	Oh, you're looking at the...
9227748	9229488	Yeah, I think I really like Dee best.
9230369	9230669	Why's that?
9230689	9234489	Dee is like gothic, goth Lolita kind of someone like that.
9234589	9235230	Exactly.
9235310	9236910	She's kind of dark and badass.
9237890	9241371	And I like Bee too because it sort of gives me that Dr. Slump vibe.
9241511	9242171	Mailbag.
9242191	9246932	Alright, I know you're reading a lot of letters, but there's some letters in our mailbag as well.
9246952	9248912	And you're complaining about me tonight!
9249312	9249932	Wow!
9251293	9251673	Wow!
9254375	9267886	Just a thought such as it is, I presume the YouTube content ID issue won't come to a head when a major partner channel such as Tabuscus and Epic Mealtime and Vsauce gets taken down for content claims.
9268327	9276474	Rather, it'll happen when Disney, say, issues a claim or has a claim issued on their behalf against content from one of Viacom's own channels or vice versa.
9278094	9281055	Also, I'm disappointed that the Mac version of the Stanley Parable requires 10.8.
9281656	9286938	I'm hesitant to upgrade my OS on my 2009 laptop to even 10.7.
9287818	9301963	Much less seriously and too wordy from what I understand of the plot of Assassin's Creed 4, I'd like to see them have taken as much historic liberties with their chanteys as with the music of Bioshock Infinity.
9302683	9314661	Ideally take inspiration from dinosaur comics and sing pop songs with babies substituted with matey Everyone's trying to be me matey, matey I love your way, matey done a bad bad thing and so on That comes from Robert M
9316673	9337181	And that's the YouTube thing I'm full of it tonight Epic Mealtime is never going to have a content ID against them Because all of their stuff is 100% original Here's something else to consider As much as that's how we all want to see it go down You all know YouTube has a secret whitelist That nobody talks about The people that are on the whitelist aren't talking about it But that's why Viacom's not going to have a copyright claim Against them ever
9337421	9338181	They're on the whitelist.
9338261	9346965	That's what some of the outrage was, is because some of these people that we would have presumed were on it, affiliates notably, were starting to get screwed by this.
9348506	9357469	I think Epic Mealtime, Epic Mealtime primary channel will not, but their spinoff, Original Gamer, assuming that's even still a thing, I actually haven't watched it in quite a couple of weeks now.
9358069	9363012	Original Gamer stands the biggest threat because of their non-original content, non-original video.
9365632	9370756	but it remains to be seen what changes do and don't happen as a result of the last couple of weeks of Fallout.
9373198	9373678	Next email.
9373878	9374059	Yes.
9375340	9376140	Greetings, OLR.
9376180	9377361	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
9377641	9378782	Was there a name on that last email?
9378802	9380884	That was Robert M. Oh, I missed that somehow.
9381744	9383085	I wanted to share a quick story.
9383265	9388187	I just finished rebuilding my DDR pad for this winter and have been jamming about four times a week.
9388268	9391869	My legs have never hurt so bad and I'm a hardcore road cyclist.
9392470	9393490	It's a different kind of impact.
9394191	9399834	Anyway, last night I finished on a heavy nine step that is lightning steps for half the song.
9400214	9403636	My legs were jello so I walked downstairs and completely pulled my left quad.
9404216	9405317	Now I can barely walk.
9405417	9410740	When people ask what happened I get a hazy look in my eye and tell them that I pulled a muscle dance into a video game.
9411140	9412401	You know the typical response?
9412822	9414082	They smile politely and walk away.
9414363	9415924	They don't know what to say.
9416024	9416544	How awkward.
9416984	9418065	I don't know what to tell you.
9419617	9425341	I'm going to give you a little bit of advice a trainer gave me, but by no means am I a trainer slash doctor, whatever.
9426281	9433025	When you are done playing DDR, don't walk downstairs, don't walk upstairs, don't do anything more strenuous.
9433425	9435687	Walk slowly and stretch.
9436247	9440570	Stretch while your muscles are warm, and usually you'll avoid cramps.
9440590	9442931	That's just my experience, but again, I'm not a professional.
9443731	9445653	I think it's a generally accepted thing out there, too.
9445713	9447754	Make sure you always stretch before you play.
9447774	9448094	No, no, no.
9448114	9448935	Don't stretch before you play.
9449155	9449315	Really?
9449335	9450115	Stretch after you warm up.
9450956	9451236	Okay.
9451316	9454758	If you stretch a muscle when it has not warmed up, you can do more damage to it.
9455404	9456105	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
9476022	9477763	Am I getting old or am I just overdoing it?
9477863	9481985	As a 34-year-old, this is my main form of exercise during the non-cycling months.
9482586	9485567	I'm sure you guys have had DDR injuries, right?
9486328	9489189	Well, actually, you remember the issue I had with... It's been a long time, but yeah.
9489369	9491090	I did fall and hit my head on the machine once.
9492031	9500075	But you remember those shoes that I had that I couldn't do jumping moves because the arch support in my shoes sent pain up my feet.
9501636	9517294	and so I would come off of the machine with shooting pain going up both of my legs coming directly from my arches because I already have pretty hefty arches in my feet I don't have flat feet I have the opposite problem I have really high arches in my feet
9518054	9529542	and when I changed from using arch support shoes to using either flats like Converse All Stars or the Airwalk equivalent and my Vibrams, that all went away.
9530502	9537046	So that was my biggest injury with DDR but I can tell you that I had pulled a...
9538067	9538627	and DarkSakura
9568326	9569987	There's a few people in chat room, by the way.
9570047	9574628	Actdeft said, I twisted my ankle playing DDR twice, once on a Cobalt Flux pad.
9574649	9575489	It was rather painful.
9579730	9581451	So, to continue this email, it's almost done.
9581711	9584052	Loki, I got Surgeon Simulator on Steam sale today.
9584252	9586133	Good grief, it's impossible, but hilarious.
9586933	9588914	Your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.
9589834	9591895	It's a fun game, and yes, it is impossible.
9592575	9593856	The space one is hilarious.
9595103	9596084	Okay, so last email.
9596744	9599006	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
9599066	9602128	You get the last email of the year.
9602168	9603509	You win air.
9603609	9604109	Take a deep breath.
9605290	9609673	Just wanted to chime in with a few thoughts I had on PAX's diversity lounge idea.
9610333	9620180	I feel like that by labeling a room as a place to learn about diversity in gaming culture is making it seem like it will be the only room where PAX minorities can feel safe and at ease.
9620840	9625924	It's a hard sell to make a room shoved into a corner feel like you're being, quote, inclusive to people.
9626684	9635050	I also wanted to bring your guys' attention to the Awesome Games Done Quick Charity Marathon, which you guys mentioned last year on your show.
9635610	9640873	You guys talked about it after the marathon was over, so I wanted to make sure all the listeners knew about the marathon before it starts.
9641314	9650360	It runs from Sunday, January 5th through the 11th and will feature some of the best speed gamers from around the world playing games fast to raise money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
9651000	9670270	I got really into speedrunning after watching last year's marathon and started learning tricks for some classic games like Super Mario 64 that would be the wall jump and Ocarina of Time learning each new trick helps drive your time down and it's kind of addicting side note my best times on the games are 22 minutes for Super Mario 64 and 25 minutes for Ocarina of Time
9671491	9675615	There are bidding wars and prize raffles throughout the marathon as well.
9676016	9687749	So if you want to donate money to a good cause, have the chance to win prizes, and watch people completely wreck games that you love in ways you never thought possible, make sure to watch and just search Awesome Games Done Quick and it will be the first link.
9688570	9689611	Thanks for reading my email.
9689651	9692693	Hope you all had a happy holiday and have a happy new year AZHP.
9693554	9693834	Thank you.
9694215	9695836	Yeah, thank you for reminding me of the charity event.
9695876	9697437	I know Flaco Jones is a big fan of this too.
9697697	9700419	He's an ex-Furl in a hoard house, watches a lot of this too.
9701680	9705043	So yeah, these guys are very popular and it's for good reason.
9705103	9706945	And yeah, that speedrun stuff can be addicting.
9707085	9709907	I'm terrible at it, but it's sure fun to think about it.
9710087	9717493	Those people are just like the level of detail that they understand a game's engine is phenomenal to me.
9718140	9720261	Well, I used to be able to do that when I was a kid.
9723702	9733464	So, I was watching, there's a buddy of mine that grew up in New Mexico that recently moved out to Maine, and I've been watching a lot of the stuff he's been playing.
9734725	9736925	He knows, like, Spyro...
9739166	9748295	I don't remember if it's two or three, but he knows Spyro glitches, like the back of his hand, and he's getting really, really good at getting them reproducible.
9749556	9753679	He's speedrunning Shattered Memories, even though I don't think there's really...
9754500	9765088	I don't think there's any glitches in it, he just finds the best path and skips through the sequences and cutscenes, the doctor sequences as much as possible, as quick as possible, that kind of stuff.
9765968	9769411	And that speedrun is literally just learning the best path of the game.
9770229	9794633	I revisited some of those awesome games on quick videos from the summer and somebody was speedrunning Super Meat Boy just Light World Clear, I don't think he did Dark Worlds but they also got Team Meat in on Skype and the programmers of the game they were shocked that they had never heard of some of these bugs before
9796321	9820616	whether they went and fixed them after the fact or figured out why they're happening I have no idea but just the level of dedication that whether they stumble across it randomly or with skill completely phenomenal and everything about that production is so fantastic great charity, great video, great skill I didn't know they do it twice a year so I'm definitely looking forward to being able to watch that in a week or two
9821089	9828154	Did you know Dan and I actually tried for like an hour each trying to learn the wall jump in Super Mario 64 so that we could get up to the roof and beat the game?
9828594	9830636	I had heard of that.
9830716	9831837	I don't think I ever tried.
9831977	9835279	There's videos up and apparently it's supposed to work in the DS version as well.
9836380	9840763	I don't have the precision to play that on Mario 64 DS.
9843118	9845121	Alright, that is it for the mailbag.
9845901	9846843	Indeed, that is it.
9846923	9850747	This is also your very last chance to vote in tonight's list list.
9851167	9852849	You're already slacking if you waited this long.
9852889	9853830	This is your last chance.
9854912	9862360	Live.VogNetwork.com and we will read the answers here shortly, but first we have the FUs of the week.
9863441	9863762	Here we go.
9880595	9886447	F you to Pinkberry for having peppermint and chocolate because it was so good and I want more.
9886888	9888911	But I've had wine tonight, so no Pinkberry.
9889952	9890553	Wine's really good.
9890573	9892414	Do you need any wine flavor for your berry?
9893015	9893315	No.
9893515	9894556	You know what, though?
9894856	9896798	They had in Japan last year, Rob.
9897238	9899820	They had muscat grape Kit Kats.
9900741	9902983	And they were amazing.
9903003	9903483	I bet.
9904024	9907627	My friend who lives in Nagoya sent... You remember my friend Julie, right?
9908147	9908327	Yeah.
9908347	9909068	And our friend Krista.
9909468	9910309	Krista lives in Nagoya.
9910469	9910729	Oh, nice.
9910889	9915193	She sent Julie a bunch of muscat Kit Kats, and we went through the whole box.
9916474	9917415	They're amazing, so...
9919235	9921017	Pinkberry, get Muscat flavor.
9921658	9921958	Do it.
9923219	9925222	Loki, you have some FUs of the week?
9927044	9930167	FU to my cat who thinks I'm a pillow or something.
9931068	9934111	He's literally an inch away from the microphone.
9934652	9937075	Jason, do you have any FUs?
9941081	9947168	I have nothing against alcohol, but F you to excuses to get smashed at 11 in the morning.
9947828	9948770	Oh yeah, that's a bit much.
9948850	9949731	And what they do to people.
9950589	9953031	I was like, you're not going to dog our wine drinking, are you?
9953051	9954592	Absolutely not.
9954993	9955973	Got to be responsible.
9956094	9957515	We always advocate responsibility as well.
9958515	9964480	My FU of the week goes to FU to the scare that Alan might be getting sick again and therefore I might be getting sick again.
9964580	9965221	I was just sick.
9965741	9966662	I don't want to be sick again.
9966762	9970966	Hey, you should be more concerned for Alan being healthy so Alan can be healthy.
9971166	9972347	No, I want to be healthy.
9974381	9974981	So rude.
9975001	9975761	But yes, it would be nice.
9975821	9977002	Alan, do you hear this fuckery?
9978162	9980003	Yes, it would be nice if Alan was healthy too.
9981103	9981663	Alright, there it is.
9982023	9983724	That is it for the FUs of the week.
9983744	9985244	What are you laughing about over there?
9986244	9986684	Nothing.
9986704	9987605	You trying to start some shit?
9987625	9988725	That's what you're trying to do over there.
9988785	9989345	No, I'm not.
9989445	9989785	Alright.
9990065	9990885	But you know what?
9991346	9992766	I do want Pinkberry right now.
9992926	9993526	Of course you do.
9993966	9995087	And I don't want to get sick either.
9996827	9998529	Alright, that is it.
9998669	10004935	We are done-zo with the question tonight from the listless question there.
10004955	10009579	I'm just waiting for the answers to load in there and we can tell you what the top answers were.
10009619	10010940	Here it is, the definitive list.
10011801	10014183	Our predictions for 2014.
10014243	10014703	Here we go.
10014763	10017364	Your number three answer.
10017605	10018285	Where's Alan?
10018585	10018845	Alan?
10018965	10019366	There he is.
10020086	10020907	Number three answer.
10020987	10024549	Bethesda confirms Fallout 4 and gives an ETA.
10024629	10025009	So there you go.
10025029	10025389	Number three.
10025749	10026210	There's the winner.
10026470	10026930	Yay.
10027230	10027751	Yay.
10027851	10028191	All right.
10028471	10029752	And I didn't mean what I said earlier.
10032013	10033233	Alright, don't cough on my mic.
10033734	10036114	Alright, the number two answer.
10036214	10037655	Here it is, number two answer.
10038175	10042916	Nintendo Year of Captain Falcon leads to F-Zero Boner Party.
10044877	10051579	And the number one answer, the thing that absolutely has to happen in 2014 as voted on by the listeners.
10052579	10056742	And thank God a shiny happy answer won after the dark places we went to tonight.
10057283	10061185	Innovation in video game industry leads to advances for the disabled.
10061245	10061846	There it is.
10061866	10062406	Good.
10062786	10063467	Very good.
10063947	10066349	We're all nice people after all.
10066389	10066789	Sometimes.
10066829	10067330	Wink, wink.
10067370	10067670	Eventually.
10068350	10068871	There it is.
10069331	10069992	The definitive list.
10070032	10077057	Again, that is Fallout 4 confirmed, F-Zero Boner Party, and Innovation leading to advances for the disabled.
10077097	10077457	There it is.
10077497	10079619	Thank you guys for participating in Listless tonight.
10079939	10080640	We hope to do that again.
10080880	10086244	We have gone too long since the last time we played that game, so we will have to do that again very soon.
10086684	10087185	So there it is.
10087385	10090729	That is it for the mailbag, the stories.
10091270	10100382	We are now ready for your calls tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10100502	10102285	It is that time to give us a call.
10102605	10103046	Now I'm going to...
10104247	10105547	I'm going to apologize in advance.
10105587	10108128	We're doing something a little different with the Skype line tonight.
10108548	10111609	And so I'm getting to test this live on air as we're going.
10112549	10113830	So please bear with us.
10114470	10117231	But with this setup, we do not have to say goodbye to Loki.
10117271	10119691	He can stay on the line and chat with our Skype calls.
10119711	10127933	So if you want to talk to Loki or anybody here in studio or give your own thoughts on what happened in 2013 or what you'd like to see in 2014, give us a call right now.
10127953	10132175	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10132715	10133255	All one word.
10134185	10137006	Meanwhile, some last minute stories, possibly, maybe.
10137326	10139067	Loki, do you have anything for last minute stories tonight?
10140447	10141587	No, sadly I don't.
10142328	10145148	Yeah, there's really not a whole heck of a lot going on, is there?
10145729	10147309	So let me see if we have any Twitter topics.
10147329	10150910	I'm going to try to pull those up real quick here again while we wait for some calls.
10150930	10155612	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10155872	10157012	You know, I hope it works.
10157032	10162254	Do you know they have a new toll-free prefix coming up?
10162694	10163174	Do they really?
10163194	10163214	844-
10164548	10165909	I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
10165929	10168049	They're just kind of going down the list of all the 800s, eight double digits.
10168330	10173132	I shouldn't be surprised that they're running out of stuff or whatever.
10173152	10177013	Considering how dirt cheap it is for anybody to pick one up now, and it's only getting easier.
10178334	10183536	It's weird that for that reason, it's not weird for that reason that non-phone number based systems aren't coming up.
10183556	10184396	What the hell am I saying?
10184656	10187317	Alright, we are getting a call, so let's get to it.
10187377	10189978	We are going to go to the phones right now and take a call.
10190479	10192880	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
10192920	10193360	Who's this?
10195870	10197111	Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind, buddy?
10198753	10202557	Well, first of all, did it work?
10202697	10203378	Yes, it worked.
10203418	10204339	We can hear you just fine.
10205560	10207502	Okay.
10207562	10210105	Well, I was thinking about Jason's.
10210165	10214009	One of Jason's answers, I think it was number one on the list list.
10214611	10218034	The indie game going AAA development.
10218935	10226081	And I was thinking about the My Little Pony fighting game that got cease and desist.
10226401	10227682	Why are you laughing, Jason?
10227702	10228883	You're laughing like crazy over there.
10229704	10231725	Because this doesn't surprise me, I guess.
10233547	10235449	Of course you're thinking about the My Little Pony game, right?
10235489	10235969	It shouldn't.
10238082	10245983	Well, I was thinking about that, and now they're working on their own game, their own original game.
10247164	10260566	And I was thinking about it and hoping that possibly it could get picked up like a big publisher or something, and get a big release.
10261706	10265727	Something like, well, maybe, possibly like Schoolgirls.
10267905	10270406	It was a small release, but then it got big.
10270906	10272867	Yeah, well, maybe not that big, or maybe not AAA, but big, mostly.
10294133	10295154	Oh, fair enough, fair enough.
10296195	10296515	What else?
10296936	10298917	Any gaming resolutions you have for 2014?
10299157	10302360	Or no, we read one of your answers during the Google answers, right?
10303361	10306724	Yeah, one of my Google, well, one of, sorry.
10307765	10308486	Something beeping over there?
10308506	10310207	Was that the Power Rangers theme?
10310227	10310988	What was that?
10311028	10311368	Yeah.
10312349	10313310	Yeah, it was my phone.
10313950	10314191	Sorry.
10315171	10319976	Well, yeah, you already read my resolutions, and sorry again, damn it.
10321434	10322995	Stop texting Actdeft.
10323035	10324577	He's on the radio, people.
10326418	10327119	Well, there we go.
10327259	10327499	Yeah.
10330011	10338357	Well, my gaming resolutions are mostly a new PC for gaming because my current one is good, but not that great.
10339598	10342800	Mostly the processor is old, so I need to at least replace that.
10343861	10347683	And yes, Matt, it was Power Rangers Ringtone.
10348144	10348544	Yes, it was.
10349404	10349705	All right.
10349925	10351606	Oh, go ahead.
10351886	10355909	Yeah, my other resolution, the HDTV is, well, my...
10356607	10367994	My top priority right now because I have the gaming consoles and even the PC which I have the video card has HDMI out so I can use that for gaming too.
10369855	10375819	Will probably happen soon since I'm pretty much saving the money for that.
10376656	10397222	so yeah, it's mostly what I want to do next year and of course my hundreds and hundreds of games on Steam and not to mention on Xbox I have the Xbox games that I haven't finished so I need to get on that There's too much to play but it's not exactly a bad problem to have, right?
10398302	10404684	Yeah, too much to play and so little time Alright, well ActDeftBuddy we're going to let you go to try and get some more calls but thanks so much for the call and have a great new year
10405728	10406308	Thank you, you too.
10428642	10431124	If I can, I want to read a tweet.
10431164	10435147	We had something from YYR and I want to make sure I got this one because this is really funny what happened here.
10435187	10443693	Okay, YYR sent us a tweet here on Twitter and it says, the number one downloadable 3DS game in Japan this year, Bike Rider DX.
10444193	10444574	Why?
10445074	10445735	It's awesome.
10446175	10448778	It's $2.99 in the North American eShop.
10449179	10450480	Buy it, OLR.
10451121	10452182	Alright, and get this.
10452883	10454825	It was retweeted by who?
10455585	10456446	The makers of the game.
10456526	10457007	Look at that.
10457427	10458709	Retweeted by the makers of the game.
10458849	10460251	So, very cool there, uh...
10460831	10462353	So yeah, I guess I'll have to check that out.
10462913	10464174	I don't know much about that game.
10464494	10465495	Is it like a site bike?
10465515	10468298	Because that's kind of what it looks like to me, just based on what little I see here.
10468338	10470180	I'm trying to see if there's some of the pictures here.
10470760	10472462	Looks like a lot of this stuff is just retweeted.
10472582	10474443	Oh no, it doesn't actually look like a site bike at all.
10475124	10477887	It's like this more like a little 2D platformer type of thing.
10477947	10478327	That's kind of cute.
10478347	10479228	That's kind of cute, yeah.
10479248	10479908	For $2.99, I'd try it.
10481890	10489178	So it's probably a style of game not terribly unlike Trials, where more lean mechanics and physics and all that kind of stuff.
10489318	10490599	Yeah, it might be a little more something like that.
10491020	10492401	This is a very attractive looking game.
10492521	10493723	I've never heard of this before.
10494483	10495124	3DS eShop.
10495845	10498788	I know what purchase I'm making in the near future.
10498948	10506355	I was like, I think I might actually have enough left in my wallet now that it's shared between Wii U and 3DS because I put like $10 in the other day when I bought Castlevania and stuff.
10506375	10510219	So I might, which I know I don't have to do that, but whatever.
10511800	10514583	Again, 1-877-GAME-O-L-R or use name on Skype, Orange Ones Radio.
10514663	10517205	Last chance to call the show ever in 2013.
10518086	10521469	So give us a call and we'll talk.
10521570	10521850	I don't know.
10521870	10523291	Do I have a lot of, do I have other tweets?
10523311	10523631	Let me look.
10524966	10525706	Let's go to other tweets.
10525746	10528527	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet for a future week.
10528887	10530068	Although I'm going to be real honest.
10530108	10532148	I tend to only see the stuff the day of the show.
10533369	10534469	S2100 Matt sent us a tweet.
10535649	10542812	Nine year in MVP baseball lives on through the Latin American mod community with the MVP Carby.
10544052	10545972	I have no idea what this is even talking about.
10546012	10553695	I think it's Caribe because it was a... I don't know all of the backstory about this because I haven't followed a lot of baseball video gaming stuff.
10553815	10553975	Mm-hmm.
10555236	10580974	But it's basically along the lines of a classic MVP baseball game Totally modded for newer rosters I remember this game, that's right, and it's been long gone So it's been gone for 10 years, this MVP baseball Because a licensing deal fell through for them 10 years ago But things live on thanks to this remake, essentially, that's on the PC Which is a celebration of Latin American baseball That's pretty cool
10582375	10583296	Okay, now I get it.
10583416	10585977	I have heard of this game before, and you can check that out.
10585997	10591441	So if you like your baseball, Latin American baseball, you can check that out.
10593021	10599025	Let's see, trying to find some other tweets here over at twitter.com slash OLR.
10600326	10606730	Gamit Hunts tweeted us earlier this week, or actually it was just yesterday, saying, Oh God, Sky, OLR.
10607270	10609433	I got started on Tiny Death Star this week.
10610114	10613539	And also, yes, I know I'm a bit behind on shows.
10613679	10615942	Not everybody can listen the week of the show.
10616262	10620868	But I was just going to say, I finally quit Tiny Death Star just before they put in the holiday stuff.
10620928	10623011	So I'm glad I got you hooked on a game that I quit.
10624273	10625554	Play the Doctor Who game instead.
10626415	10626996	Damn it, Brad.
10627076	10628577	Brad was telling me about that game.
10628637	10629238	It's pretty fun.
10629298	10629558	Is it?
10630119	10631000	How much is it on iOS?
10631800	10632081	Free.
10632862	10633803	Oh.
10633823	10634403	I like that.
10634503	10639949	It has the stupid transaction thing again, but you don't need any of them.
10640049	10641250	I haven't ever used any.
10641290	10642492	And they give you freebies all the time.
10644393	10656998	I think I've just I've been replaying levels actually to unlock characters until I got the Sontaran Butler and I always forget that guy's name but like I have River Song now I'm very happy
10659062	10659383	All right.
10659903	10662486	I'm going to give one more shout-out for the Skype line and see if we get anybody.
10662526	10662966	That's weird.
10663026	10666249	No, everybody's shy here on the last night of the year.
10666269	10668091	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10668891	10674376	I was worried that the setup didn't work because I have things run differently tonight, but Actdeft got through, so I know it works.
10674957	10677319	I think that they're being reflective on the year.
10678299	10680380	Are they just being quiet and pensive on the year?
10681181	10681521	Perhaps?
10681861	10682401	I think so.
10682822	10685603	So there's a lot of Doctor Who games that all have subtitles.
10685623	10688024	Do you know what the subtitle for this particular one is?
10688264	10691546	Crap, let me look it up because I have my phone in my hand.
10691706	10694027	Let me do a couple other quick tweets if I can real quick.
10694427	10695167	There was a tweet.
10695288	10697509	I remember this email from last week.
10697529	10699710	I don't know if you guys remember this email last week from C.K.
10699870	10706453	Ender who was kind of giving us another perspective and I believe it was the email on the NSA and it was kind of making us think differently about that.
10706733	10710796	Well, CK Ender sent us a tweet and said, thanks for reading my email and giving it a fair shake.
10710936	10711697	Great show this week.
10711737	10712317	Hey, you know what?
10713158	10715560	Well thought out opinions.
10715920	10719163	I'm always for presenting both sides of the story, so I'm all for that.
10720044	10730712	Let's see, we also have another tweet from earlier this week from Dave Falcon, who said, to the OLR gang, Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, hope you and your families have a great Xmas and best wishes for Happy New Year.
10730752	10731432	Well, thank you very much.
10731473	10731833	Same to you.
10732133	10732814	That was kind.
10732974	10733674	That was very nice.
10734475	10736217	Alright, and Tigerclaw sent us one more tweet again.
10736237	10738379	This is the last call for calls.
10739140	10741822	I can't believe nobody's going to call in last show of the year except Actdeft.
10741842	10744224	Are you guys going to let Actdeft have the final word this year?
10744825	10745646	Alright, one, eight, one.
10745666	10748048	I think Actdeft has earned the final word.
10748633	10752915	1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10753936	10758058	TigerClaw305 sending us a tweet here, and this will probably be the last one for the year.
10758638	10762920	Porn discovered on 3DS purchased as Christmas present for 8-year-old.
10763561	10765162	I saw that.
10765202	10767223	I can't believe this didn't make it in the show roll.
10767263	10769584	I even came across this this week and meant to put it in.
10769764	10776631	Here's why I don't necessarily like talking about this article.
10776891	10779774	This really at its core has nothing to do with gaming.
10780575	10784439	It's just shithead moves giving all of us a bad name.
10784479	10787462	And I'm not saying you can't put porn on your 3DS.
10787562	10787983	I don't care.
10788103	10789224	Put all the porn you want on your 3DS.
10790405	10793146	Get rid of it if you're going to sell it to a third party.
10793486	10795846	Because A, you want to get rid of your personal data.
10795967	10797947	B, what if that's you in that porn?
10798187	10800108	Most companies have a protocol for removal.
10800228	10802048	Which this company should have done.
10802068	10803909	In words and not in execution.
10804029	10805769	Yeah, but during the Christmas season.
10806049	10810370	Oh, it is a link to a local news story.
10811631	10812511	Of course it's local news.
10812891	10814012	I gotta bring it up here.
10814152	10815952	I gotta see how the local news... You know what?
10815972	10818674	If you guys aren't gonna call us on Skype, then we're gonna entertain ourselves here.
10819634	10820294	You know what's worse?
10820535	10820735	Huh?
10821655	10822275	My local news.
10822295	10823976	I actually recognize the station.
10824556	10826917	Oh, it was... It's Colorado's local... Colorado's news?
10826937	10827658	Denver's local NBC.
10827738	10828178	Uh-oh.
10828638	10828938	Uh-oh.
10828978	10829619	Well, let's see here.
10829659	10831500	I'm gonna try to bring this up here in studio real quick.
10831920	10834741	Again, I did not screen this, so we're gonna take a look at this.
10834761	10835461	We're doing it live!
10835661	10836222	Yeah, fuck it!
10836242	10836902	We'll do it live!
10838786	10839246	All right, let's see.
10839286	10839726	Where is it?
10839906	10840547	Where's the story?
10841627	10842027	Oh, here it is.
10842507	10843027	Wavy?
10844788	10847789	DaveyWavyNews10 reports on this story.
10847929	10848549	Here it is.
10849409	10852570	W-A-V-Y, 10 on your side.
10853450	10854251	Wait, what?
10855431	10855971	That's what it says.
10855991	10857932	I was going to say, W-A-V-Y is not out of Colorado.
10858092	10859072	Is that out of Hampton, Virginia?
10862185	10862465	I don't know
10880209	10889358	Of course there's a... They want... It's a hilarious local ad for a car place that's selling tires with... At least it's not twerking Santa.
10889518	10891039	Santa shaking his butt there.
10892501	10893041	Oh, God.
10893101	10894322	I know which part of Virginia this is.
10894362	10894843	I've been here.
10894943	10895283	All right.
10896304	10897524	Here we go.
10897604	10902505	A family in Hampton finds sexual images on their son's new gaming console.
10902665	10903885	They bought it for Christmas.
10903945	10906846	Their son was the first to discover the disturbing images.
10907166	10911547	10 on your side's Jason Marks is investigating... And they bought it for Christmas!
10913627	10916568	The way she sing-songed that really disturbed me.
10916848	10917968	...how this could have happened.
10918008	10918348	Jason?
10918488	10920908	Anita, that's the question everyone is asking.
10921008	10923929	How could porn get on a newly bought Nintendo DS?
10924718	10926879	How do people put things on memory cards?
10926919	10930080	How does porn get on something connected to the internet?
10930560	10931840	How does that happen?
10931880	10932741	That blows my mind.
10933021	10936882	Jamie, how does porn get on an internet-enabled device?
10937762	10939063	Because someone owned it before.
10940543	10940743	Oh.
10941323	10944924	Well, why did Channel 10 have to invent... Because they're stupid.
10945685	10947585	Well, to be fair, we haven't seen this the whole way through.
10947605	10948806	No, they're stupid.
10948886	10949366	I looked at it.
10949386	10949666	They're stupid.
10949686	10951046	They're great for us playing this clip on the show.
10951066	10952687	A gift that was meant for an eight-year-old.
10954048	10957551	Normally he would be asking to play on his DS and hasn't yet.
10957851	10963816	Sure, any kid who just got a Nintendo DS Christmas morning would be chomping at the bit to play the system.
10964497	10969381	But Tom Mayhew's 8-year-old son got an eyeful just after opening his gift.
10969681	10973004	Later on during the day he went to play his games, not knowing anything was on it.
10974545	10982487	And then after a while, they took a picture of themselves, a couple of the kids that were here, and when the picture was taken, it went to a file.
10983648	10985968	When that file was opened, there was already pictures on it.
10986148	10990469	Not just any pictures, images the Hampton 8-year-old should never see.
10990689	10999392	It was a shocker because we had quite a bit of the family over, so there was a lot of kids here, and the kids were the ones that discovered those pictures.
11000342	11001844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11015800	11021602	Like, when you open the 3DS, you don't think, oh, I better go in and check all the pictures, you know, and that whole thing.
11021642	11023483	So it makes sense that, oh, the kids took the picture.
11023743	11027445	They went to go look at the pictures of themselves in OMG boobs, you know.
11027525	11029385	So, I mean, the story does make sense.
11029725	11031906	And the thing, too, is they bought it new.
11031926	11033847	It wasn't like they were buying the used system.
11034027	11034988	So they claim.
11035688	11035948	Yeah.
11036008	11037749	There's the text of the article.
11037769	11041870	Well, they bought it from Walmart, though, so Walmart doesn't sell used stuff.
11041930	11043611	Walmart does open box.
11044634	11046242	Walmart will sell a return.
11046943	11049325	Mayu says the DS had a dozen pornographic pictures
11074466	11076907	Now he wants to know where they came from.
11077328	11080189	Well, why don't you ask the lady?
11081970	11083811	Well, they could have been like internet porno, who knows.
11083831	11084271	It's a big mistake.
11084291	11086573	It's important to note that people will think that.
11101806	11102466	They're dumb.
11128383	11129684	Thanks for watching!
11143951	11145371	It's a very different situation.
11167518	11169141	These were not pictures.
11169281	11173788	Yeah, you can save things, save images from the browser to the SD card or what have you.
11174048	11175471	But it's interesting, it wasn't pictures.
11177134	11179815	Mayu tells us the pictures were time stamped in early December.
11179835	11181175	He bought the system here at the Hampton Walmart the 23rd.
11181196	11184297	Ten on your side called the corporate office and were still waiting to get a call back.
11203244	11208670	Oh, so they didn't even get a comment yet.
11208730	11211052	They just called the corporate office and no letter yet.
11211372	11213054	Well, what's Walmart going to say to that?
11213975	11214696	Oh, man.
11215377	11217939	Clearly an employee was putting boobies on our 3DS.
11217959	11218820	Here's a gift card.
11218840	11219901	Yeah, here's a gift card.
11221143	11221883	Let me let this finish.
11222304	11224806	Mainly is what is my youngest son doing?
11227591	11230155	Dad plans to soon have the talk with his son.
11230796	11234363	A conversation he thought would only come several years from now.
11234723	11235645	It's an eye opener.
11236586	11237829	Why would those even be on there?
11240037	11243899	Mayu says he found another clue that could show that there was a return system.
11243939	11247901	The Nintendo DS comes with parental controls that require a password.
11248241	11253564	On his DS, the parental controls were already set up, password included.
11254044	11256826	As I mentioned, we're still waiting for Walmart to call us back.
11257086	11259408	I don't remember going through that.
11259648	11261589	Walmart sold a return system as new.
11261609	11262269	That's what they did.
11262289	11264251	Alright, fine.
11264291	11264631	Thank you.
11265011	11269894	Thank you Davey Wavy News for the clip there.
11270495	11282742	To be perfectly honest, I think that especially if that was just a re-boxed return then yeah, he's within his rights to first of all, request a new system and have that sent back.
11283183	11284303	Because clearly
11285604	11288385	It's, I'm trying to remember what it is too.
11288985	11294387	You can't sell a used system without marking that it has been used or a refurb.
11295207	11303009	That goes against, I'm trying to wrap my brain because I was reading up on the resale law too just not too long ago.
11303769	11305450	That has to do with truth in advertising.
11306290	11308231	I see that at Fry's all the time too.
11308251	11310151	But Fry's will flat out say return.
11310371	11312512	They have a big sticker on it that says this is a return.
11312532	11312892	Right.
11313552	11318374	When you go to any other retailer, it will say refurbished.
11318674	11324656	In the rush of the holidays, that didn't happen at this Walmart, and now they're going to get right through the coals for it.
11324696	11325716	But here's the thing.
11325956	11328477	Well, I can't think of a company that deserves it more, but still.
11328777	11329317	Thanks for watching!
11353463	11368861	and for all we know this should be common sense regardless this prank was probably this whole thing was probably a prank if you think about it the whole thing was probably a setup because there's probably some assholes watching the news giggling yeah oh yeah absolutely the whole thing's probably a setup we showed that little kid some dick
11370103	11372204	Which is kind of fucked up in a way.
11372245	11376628	Or plot twist, it was the news station that returned it with support on it.
11376668	11377408	For ratings.
11378149	11379510	For ratings.
11379550	11380870	Trying to make some waves.
11381851	11383692	I don't think either of those are the case.
11383933	11386835	I don't think it was a new system and I don't think it was intentional.
11387755	11395761	But it was a guy that did something, or perhaps not even a guy, but it was somebody that did something with the system and ultimately didn't want it because they didn't want to
11396401	11418737	have to continue to pay for new things so they took it back it was just before there's a myriad of other possibilities considering it was just before Christmas I don't I'm with you on the fact that this isn't gaming news and this is just tripe if that's even the correct word to use in this situation this is slow news week news alright fair enough
11419116	11420177	Alright, well that is going to do it.
11420217	11421439	I'm going to close up the Skype line.
11421479	11422060	How sad.
11422480	11429369	I would have thought more of you would want to see our new studio cam on Skype, but I guess I'll have to wait until next week.
11429849	11431111	Actdeft didn't say anything about it either.
11431331	11432833	He was talking about it in chat.
11432973	11437539	I would have thought the first caller would have been like, whoa, I can see you guys now.
11438740	11442123	You know, if we get one more call, I'll even be willing to let it point at me.
11442203	11442764	I closed it.
11443344	11443685	Too late.
11443745	11444445	You lose.
11444706	11447869	It will have to be a 2014 enhancement to the show.
11447949	11449970	Except Actdeft got a sneak peek because he was willing to call.
11450371	11450711	So there it is.
11450731	11453474	We're going to close up the Skype line and we're going to close up shop here.
11454414	11456695	at Orange Lounge Radio for the night and for the year.
11456955	11459056	And thank you guys as always for being here.
11459357	11460377	Thank you for listening to the show.
11460677	11463218	Thank you for supporting the show all year long.
11463639	11467941	Whether you're new this year or you've been listening for the past eight years, we really appreciate your support.
11468601	11471102	If you like what you hear, please tell a friend or five about the show.
11471502	11472623	Really, really appreciate it.
11473163	11474644	Spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
11474664	11475884	That's all we have is word of mouth.
11476385	11478005	I did have a last minute story real quick.
11478045	11478466	Oh, you do?
11478486	11480386	Yeah, real quick.
11480587	11481027	What the hell?
11481067	11481507	Go for it.
11482543	11498814	Okay, apparently at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress, which is a hacker con, they demonstrated that they have cracked the Nintendo Wii U gamepad controller to allow streaming of PC content to it.
11499194	11501796	So you can use it almost like Nvidia's Shield.
11502036	11502617	Oh, wow.
11503637	11510122	And so, it's obviously early and a little bit buggy, but they're releasing code out there to
11511144	11511804	Make that happen.
11511844	11516770	Apparently they're building tools to allow that to stream stuff on Windows and OSX.
11518452	11520414	CCC is an amazing collective.
11520634	11522636	They do some fantastic shit.
11523177	11523978	I love them so much.
11524038	11525360	This is great news.
11526581	11527982	Didn't they also crack the Wiimote?
11529865	11530005	Uh...
11531503	11533424	I don't remember what name went behind that.
11534225	11545332	If you caught the news about the lifting fingerprints off the phone in order to fake out the iPhone 5S's fingerprint sensor, that was also a CCC project.
11546233	11551276	They are based out of Germany, and a co-worker of mine has been to a handful of their meetups before.
11552817	11554718	If I ever find myself in Germany, I would love to go.
11556903	11557403	Alrighty.
11558424	11559525	Some thoughts in our chat room.
11559565	11561606	Ragenator saying, here's a thought on the porn story.
11561986	11570431	What are the odds that a parent, probably the dad, was testing out the system before it was wrapped, forgot that the pics were on the system, and when the pics were discovered, the parents tried covering their asses?
11570891	11576394	You know, crazier things have happened in the world, but in this case, I don't really think that's happened.
11576434	11578616	But you know what's interesting?
11578636	11579916	My finger slipped on the trigger.
11579936	11581397	There's guys sitting at home watching Channel 10.
11581477	11583598	The problem, too, is the date stamp is different.
11583618	11585760	The date stamp's earlier than he purchased it.
11585960	11586320	That's true.
11587136	11589498	Alright, well anyway, okay, we really are going to wrap up the show.
11589558	11593462	I don't want to talk, for the first time in my life, I don't want to talk about porn anymore.
11593482	11597186	Alright, that is going to do it though for another episode.
11597206	11598887	It's a Christmas miracle!
11600009	11600609	Christmas is over.
11600629	11601270	Here you go, kid!
11601690	11601990	Dick!
11602871	11604193	You get dick for Christmas!
11604793	11619633	Alright, that's it, we're done, we're out of here Thank you guys so much for supporting the show And again, tell a friend about the show We're going to go around and get final thoughts Jason, thank you for being here, taking the trek from the Bay Area to be here I'm hoping we can at least do one show in your neck of the woods at some point It will be wonderful if it comes to fruition
11619873	11620153	Oh, man.
11636149	11636610	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
11653071	11655812	We did do a live show there during one of the E3s.
11655832	11659213	That would probably be the last time we did a full-on show, start to finish, remote.
11659233	11660194	That was a really cool setup.
11660214	11661374	That was only a couple years ago.
11661394	11663335	That was, what, 2006, I think?
11663355	11664855	Like I said, just a couple.
11665475	11666115	Good memories, though.
11668736	11669377	Okay, that's it.
11669637	11670637	We're going to go around and get final thoughts.
11670677	11671917	Jason, now is your turn.
11672037	11672638	What's your final thought?
11673638	11674778	Merry fucking 2014, people.
11676039	11676759	Good final thought.
11677719	11679760	Loki via the Skype line, your final thought?
11682099	11686282	It looks like Grand Theft Auto V is becoming the hacker fest as Grand Theft Auto IV was.
11686442	11690965	It's supposed to be interesting how they slap the wrists of all these people doing that.
11691145	11692246	I've been hearing that, actually.
11692586	11693167	What a shock.
11693347	11697429	I am so shocked that somebody has hacked Grand Theft Auto V. This is so surprising.
11698350	11699310	They made it so easy.
11699390	11701592	That's the problem.
11702560	11731577	my final thought tonight is I feel really good you know what this has been a really good year for the show one of our best since probably and I'm not really talking quality like this show's always good no but you know we always we always try to bring it every week but just just in terms of like the growth of the show and everything this has been probably like our best year since like podcasting went live so I just like really want to thank everybody again for their support and the new listeners we've got over the year and just you know thank you for being a part of our little family here on Sunday nights really appreciate it thank you
11732057	11733958	DarkSakura, last but not least, the final word of 2013.
11734278	11738541	I'm actually going to retire Reject False Icons because Gorillaz is gone.
11739341	11740162	Did they officially?
11740422	11743964	I think Gorillaz is officially over because Blur's touring again.
11744444	11744704	I see.
11745124	11746845	But I have a new one for you guys.
11747065	11747345	Okay.

11752028	11752388	All right.
11752728	11754309	Think before you speak, think before you type.
11755570	11757451	In other words, don't be an asshole.
11758378	11760359	That's the number one rule of gaming online.
11760379	11760999	Don't be a dick.
11761559	11762879	Unfortunately, way too many people do it.
11763319	11763959	All right, guys.

11773402	11774042	Do not drive.
11774122	11774962	Have your plan to get home.
11774982	11775802	And don't get married.
11775902	11777063	Before New Year's Eve.
11778303	11779925	Don't have a Britney Spears wedding.
11780325	11781307	Don't have sex.
